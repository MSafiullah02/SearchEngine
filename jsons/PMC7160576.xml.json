Western blot analysis further confirmed that the protein expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 was increased in these cholestatic liver tissues when compared with the healthy control subjects (Figure 1B). Previous reports have shown that serum IL-1\u03b2 levels are increased in patients with PBC and PSC.10,11 Together, these findings suggest that the inflammasome plays a role in the pathogenesis of human cholestatic liver injury.",

As demonstrated in Figure 2A, Nlrp3 RNA expression was increased in both WT and Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers when compared with the sham control subjects. However, cleaved caspase-1 (20 kD) was found only in WT BDL livers (Figure 2B), indicating that the inflammasome was activated only in the WT cholestatic mice. Deficiency of Caspase-1 protein (both pro and cleaved forms) in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 livers confirmed that the inflammasome was not activated in these mice. After BDL for 7 days, plasma levels of liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly lower in the Casp1\u2013/\u2013 mice than in the WT BDL group (Figure 3A). Plasma IL-1\u03b2 was elevated in WT mice but not in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 mice after BDL. In contrast, bile acid levels in both plasma (Figure 3A) and liver, while elevated after BDL compared with the sham control subjects, were not different between the Casp1\u2013/\u2013 and WT mice 7 days after BDL (data not shown).",

This later finding was confirmed by Sirius staining of liver sections, measurements of hepatic hydroxyproline content and Western blot of smooth muscle actin protein in the Casp1\u2013/\u2013 liver after BDL (Figure 3C).

However, hepatic mRNA expression of genes involved in maintaining bile acid homeostasis were not substantially different between WT and Casp1\u2013/\u2013 groups after BDL. These include the nuclear receptors Fxr/Nr1h4 and Shp/Nr0b2; bile acid transporters Ntcp/Slc10a1, Ost\u03b1/Slc51a, Bsep/Abcb11, and Mrp2/Abcc2; and the bile acid synthesis enzyme Cyp7a1. Also no differences were seen in the mRNA level of Il-1\u03b2, Ccl2, and Cxcl2 mRNA between these 2 groups, either (Figure 4 and data not shown).",

While there were no differences in Elane and Cd3e expression between WT and Casp1\u2013/\u2013 groups after 7 days BDL, Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers had significantly higher amounts of F4/80 than was detected in the WT BDL livers (Figure 5A), indicating that there were more macrophage/Kupffer cells in the absence of inflammasome activation. To confirm this observation, we performed immunohistochemistry of liver sections from WT and Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers. As shown in Figure 5B, there were more F4/80 positive areas in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 livers than WT livers after BDL. To further characterize the hepatic macrophage or Kupffer cell phenotype in these mice, we analyzed the mRNA expression of markers that differentiate between pro- and anti-inflammatory types (ie, M1 and M2, respectively), including Arginase 1, Il-4, Il-33, Cd163, Fizz1, and Ym-1. We found that BDL resulted in a significant decrease in expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-4. However, this decrease was significantly less in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL liver than in WT BDL livers (Figure 5A), suggesting there were more anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophages in the Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers. Higher expression levels of other M2-type macrophage markers (ie, Cd163, Il-33, and Fizz1) were also found in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers than in WT BDL livers, consistent with a higher number of M2 macrophages in the former (Figure 5A). There were no differences in arginase-1 mRNA expression among the 4 groups, presumably because arginase-1 is normally abundantly expressed in hepatocytes. Immunofluorescent labeling of hepatic CD206 (another M2 macrophage marker) further confirmed that there were more M2 macrophages in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers than in WT BDL livers (Figure 5B). Together, these findings suggest that the normal function of inflammasome activation is proinflammatory (as seen in WT BDL mice) but that in the absence of inflammasome activation, there is a partial conversion from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory environment with respect to the macrophage phenotype (as seen in the Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers).",

When hepatocytes were treated with 100 \u03bcM taurocholic acid (TCA) (the major endogenous bile acid in mice) for 24 hours, mRNA expression of chemokines Ccl2, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10 was markedly increased, as previously reported (Figure 6A),1,2 but Il-1\u03b2 mRNA expression remained undetectable in these cells. Deficiency of caspase-1 did not alter TCA induction of Ccl2, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, and Nlrp3 in these mouse hepatocytes (Figure 6A). In addition, Western blot analysis did not detect any cleavage of caspase-1 when WT mouse hepatocytes were exposed to TCA (up to 300 \u03bcM, the high end of pathophysiologically relevant concentrations) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for 16 hours (Figure 6B), indicating that the inflammasome was not activated in hepatocytes by these measures. Furthermore, glycocholic acid 50 \u03bcM, another major endogenous bile acid- and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (100 \u03bcM) treatments also did not cause pro-caspase-1 cleavage in these mouse hepatocytes. In contrast, increased pro-Il-1\u03b2 protein expression and pro-caspase-1 cleavage were found in mouse macrophage cultures that were exposed to LPS and ATP, an indication of inflammasome activation in these cells (as a positive control). However, TCA treatment alone or in combination with LPS and ATP increased neither pro-Il-1\u03b2 protein expression nor caspase-1 cleavage (Figure 6C).",

We found that (1) hepatic expression of the inflammasome genes NLRP1, NLPR3, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2 (mRNA and or protein) were increased in cholestatic patients with PBC or PSC (Figure 1); (2) increased expression and activation of inflammasome genes were also seen in cholestatic mouse livers after BDL (Figure 2); (3) lack of inflammasome activation in mice reduced markers of cholestatic hepatic injury (ALT and ALP) but increased liver fibrosis after BDL (Figures 3 and 4); (4) deficiency of caspase-1 in mice also promoted an increase of the M2 macrophages phenotype in the liver after BDL, thus presumably partially converting a proinflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory state (Figure 5); and (5) at pathophysiological concentrations, the major endogenous bile acid TCA did not activate the inflammasome in mouse hepatocytes or macrophages (Figure 6). Therefore, we conclude that while the inflammasome is activated in cholestatic liver and contributes to the injury, this activation does not appear to occur through the direct action of bile acids. It is likely that this activation involves the macrophage rather than the hepatocyte in the liver.",

            "text": "The role of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of different diseases has often been conflicting. Inflammasome signaling has been reported to protect the liver from hepatic tumor growth, virus infection and to increase survival rates in response to a hepatic parasitic load (Trypanosoma cruzi) in mice.5,12, 13, 14 In contrast, the inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease and NASH.4,15 In the present study, we found that the inflammasome is indeed activated in cholestatic livers and that loss of inflammasome activation in mice reduces acute manifestations of hepatic injury (ALT and ALP) without significant alterations in liver necrosis, bile duct proliferation, or gross estimates of inflammation, while paradoxically enhancing liver fibrosis. If fibrogenesis is considered as part of the process of tissue healing following an inflammatory injury, we may conclude that deactivation of the inflammasome in cholestasis blocks its proinflammatory properties, suggesting that when active, its role would be more consistent with that seen in other liver disorders such as alcoholic liver disease and NASH.4 This hypothesis is consistent with the increase of the M2-type macrophages in the liver of the Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL mice, as reflected by the higher expression of its marker genes such as Il-4, Il-33, Cd163, Fizz1, and CD206 (Figure 5). The increase in Il-4 is known to lead to stimulation of Tgf-\u03b21 expression, a classic profibrotic cytokine.16, 17, 18 This would explain why fibrosis was increased in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL livers, as illustrated in Figure 7. The reduced hepatic injury seen in Casp1\u2013/\u2013 BDL mice (absence of the inflammasome) is also consistent with several earlier reports in which depletion of macrophages attenuated liver injury in rodent models of cholestasis.19, 20, 21, 22",

However, our findings do not support this hypothesis and indicate that bile acids do not directly activate the inflammasome in hepatocytes or macrophages or Kupffer cells at concentrations that are pathophysiologically relevant. Previous studies that have supported this hypothesis have used hydrophobic bile acid species such as chenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid at high concentrations that are not seen in cholestatic patients or animal models and thus are likely to be artifacts of these in vitro conditions.7,8,23 The major species of endogenous bile acids are conjugated bile acids that require bile acid transport proteins to enter cells. These transporters are only seen in hepatic parenchymal cells and are absent in macrophages and other hepatic cells. Unconjugated bile acids can diffuse into cells but never reach pathophysiologic levels.24 While the mechanism by which the inflammasome is activated in cholestatic liver remains to be determined, we speculate that it is related to the well-described inflammatory response generated from the hepatocyte that is induced by the hepatic retention of bile acids.1,2,25 When hepatic parenchymal cells undergo necrosis during cholestasis, alarmins (eg, ATP and other damage-associated molecular patterns) are released from the dying cells and would trigger the activation of the inflammasome in hepatic macrophages or Kupffer cells and orchestrate an immune response that contributes to liver injury,22 as shown in Figure 7.",

Six images were randomly taken across the section under 100\u00d7 magnification using an Olympus (Olympus Corp, Japan) BX51 microscope. ImageJ 1.51n software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to calculate the positive-signal area. For immunofluorescent labeling of CD206, a monoclonal antibody (Cat# MCA2235T, from Bio-Rad [Hercules, CA], 1:100 dilution) was incubated with frozen liver section from 3 randomly selected animals in each BDL groups. Five images were randomly taken across the section under 200\u00d7 magnification using an Zeiss (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, White Plains, NY) Fluorescent microscope. The count of CD206 positive cells in each image field was assessed in a blinded fashion. Liver hydroxyproline content was assayed as previously described.30",
