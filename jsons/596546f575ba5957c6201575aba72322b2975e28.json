We here found that glucocorticoid-activating enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1), which converts inactive cortisone to the active cortisol and thereby regulates tissue glucocorticoid (GC) levels, was greatly upregulated by IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 in human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in a synergistic manner. While IFN\u03b3 alone was not able to induce HSD11B1, it could increase the activity of NF-kB and thus augment the upregulation of HSD11B1 by TNF\u03b1. Interestingly, the upregulation of HSD11B1 by IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 also required glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, HSD11B1 was shown to be required for the expression of TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), an important anti-inflammatory effector molecule of MSCs. Therefore, the inflammatory factors IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 can promote GC metabolism and thereby drive the expression of anti-inflammatory factor TSG-6 in human UC-MSCs, forming a potential negative feedback loop. These findings help to understand the relationship between inflammation and GC metabolism.",

It functions to convert inactive cortisone to the active cortisol 2 . Because endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) is indispensable for maintaining homeostasis, HSD11B1 is also expected to play a critical role in the modulation of metabolism and inflammatory response. Indeed, some chronic inflammatory conditions have been found to be associated with increased HSD11B1 expression, such as atherosclerosis 3 , inflammatory bowel disease, and colitis 4, 5 . These observations are in line with many reports of induction of HSD11B1 expression by proinflammatory cytokines in various cell types [6] [7] [8] . In general, the regulation of HSD11B1 expression by inflammatory factors appears to be cell type-specifics. For instance, TNF\u03b1 induce HSD11B1 expression in human fibroblasts, but not in human primary hepatocytes 9, 10 . Therefore, the expression and function of HSD11B1 remain to be further elucidated.",

Because GC is critically involved in the regulation of inflammation, we set to explore the roles of GC metabolism in MSCs. Several reports showed that HSD11B1, the main enzyme that metabolizes GC, was upregulated in human fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes by TNF\u03b1 25 . We therefore first examined the direct effect of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 stimulation on HSD11B1 expression in human UC-MSCs. We added recombinant human TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 each alone or in combination to the culture of human UC-MSCs. TNF\u03b1 induced the expression of HSD11B1 (Fig. 1a, b) , which is consistent with other studies. Surprisingly, while IFN\u03b3 alone did not induce HSD11B1, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 in combination substantially increased the expression of HSD11B1.
