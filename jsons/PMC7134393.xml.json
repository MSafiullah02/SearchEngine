Humoral immune responses, especially neutralizing antibodies, induced by viral infection have protective effects. However, the role of cellular immune response induced by Ebola virus infection is not systematically studied. Starting with the screening and identification of immune restrictive-epitopes, we are using our humanized MHC transgenic mice (HLA-A11/DR01,HLA-A2/DR15 and HLA-A2/DP4) to determined the immune restrictive-epitopes for different ethnic groups, and to explored the role of major viral protein epitopes in immune protection.",
