As of April 13, 2020, there are ~555,000 confirmed cases in the United States and ~22,000 deaths; almost half of the deaths to date are in the state of New York. In New York City, with a population density of 26,430 people per square mile, the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000 1 , social distancing may mitigate the strain on existing health care systems. Furthermore, the absence of widely available testing has resulted in additional use of already limited resources, including hospital beds, personal protective equipment and staff. As nephrologists, we see our primary goals as twofold: 1) keeping our existing patients safe both at home and in their dialysis units, and 2) meeting the needs of patients who do require hospitalization, both COVID related and unrelated.",

Given this surge in dialysis needs as well as a rise in the number of clotted dialysis systems resulting in either prolonged treatment time or inadequate treatments due to the prothrombotic nature of COVID-19, 2 and decreased hemodialysis nursing staff availability due to COVID-19, our current dialysis setup has been insufficient to handle the load.

In the event that we still cannot meet our dialysis demands we would then consider switching maintenance hemodialysis patients temporarily to PD while in the inpatient setting. The acute PD program is being applied to all admitted patients, regardless of their COVID-19 status. AKI patients who require urgent clearance (hyperkalemia -K > 6.0mEq, severe uremic symptoms -such as pericardial effusions or seizures, and severe acidosis -pH < 7.2), as well as prone patients were not considered good candidates for acute PD and it was recommended that they have hemodialysis catheters placed instead.

The LPNs/technicians are available to the hospital nurses during the cycler treatments and can communicate any issues directly with the nephrologist on-call. We have surgeons and an interventional nephrologist on staff at Mount Sinai with expertise in PD catheter placement. They are committed to providing their support through the timely placement of double cuff peritoneal dialysis catheters. Patients who are on room air or nasal cannula are transported to the interventional radiology suite for fluoroscopic catheter placement by the interventional nephrologist, while patients who are intubated have their catheters placed at the bedside by the surgery team. Patients who are on high flow nasal cannula, bi-level positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP), or a non-rebreather mask would be assessed by the radiology team for suitability of catheter placement given their high risk of decompensation with sedation, potentially resulting in intubation and mechanical ventilation. A decision would then be taken by them as to whether the patient is a suitable candidate for the procedure or not. Our acute PD implementation protocol is below: 1) The nephrologist(s) assess the patient's suitability for PD then communicate with the surgeon/interventional radiologist for catheter placement 2) PD catheter insertion followed by initiation within 48-72 hours with low volumes and a high number of exchanges 3) PD is performed overnight or throughout the day (according to individual patient needs) 4) At the end of each treatment session, an LPN collects data from the cyclers (initial drain, ultrafiltration, average dwell time, number of cycles, and average drain time) and documents this information in the electronic medical record, which can be reviewed by the covering nephrologist, with prescription changes made accordingly.",
