N also has been found to be connected with Nsp9, Nsp10 and viral RNA (Chen et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2012). The N protein has been proven to be multiphosphorylated (Wootton et al., 2002).

However, the post-translational and other modification sites of N protein are still unclear, especially the phosphorylation sites. To date, mass spectrometry has proved to be a powerful tool in the analysis of protein phosphorylation sites (Bittremieux et al., 2017). Since N protein is difficult to purify from virions (Chen et al., 2005), in this research, a baculovirus expression system, which is widely used in analyzing post-translational protein modifications, was used to express the N protein (Peng et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2017). We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) to identify the modification sites of N protein expressed in Sf9 cells. The analysis achieved 85% coverage of the N protein and identified two phosphorylation sites, namely, residues 105 and 120. Our results show that residue 105 is a phosphorylation site and that residues 105 and 120 are important for N protein function.",

There were significant differences between the wild-type virus and A105, A120 and A105-120 viruses at 48 hpi (Fig. 6\nA). Compared with the A105 and A120, A105-120 showed lower viral growth. For quantitative analysis of PRRSV, total RNA was extracted for real-time PCR as previously reported (Xie et al., 2014). The real-time PCR results showed that the Nsp9 gene level was lowest in A105-120 (Fig. 6B). Then,the PAMs(primary PAMs) were infected with 0.1MOI PRRSV.

Since the N protein could up-regulate IL-10, according to previous research (Yu et al., 2017), PAMs were transfected with four plasmids. The qPCR results suggested that the mutation down-regulated the induction of IL-10 mRNA.

Therefore, we substituted Ser105 and Ser120 with Ala individually and together. The three mutant viruses were rescued from Marc-145 cells. It is indicated that the phosphorylation of N protein may not be essential for the viability of PRRSV.

Our results showed that the mutations did not change the distribution of N protein in infected cells. The poor growth ability may be related to host cytokine activity or protein binding activity to viral RNA. In terms of binding activity to viral RNA, as we know, the modifications and structure of the PRRSV N protein are similar to those of Coronavirus (Chang et al., 2005). It is possible that they have the similar mechanism. In the case of IBV or MHV, the phosphorylated N protein may have a higher binding affinity than the unphosphorylated N protein for genomic RNA (Spencer et al., 2008). Therefore, we speculated that the phosphorylation modification may help N protein to bind to viral RNA, and hence the mutation to the phosphorylated residue would decrease this binding. However, the mechanism underlying the poor growth ability of these mutants still needs further investigation.",

Our qPCR results showed that constitutive dephosphorylation decreases the N-induced expression of IL-10 mRNA in transfected PAMs. Utilizing reverse genetics, we found that Ser105 and Ser120 did not affect virus infection and viability but does play a role in viral growth. Those findings indicated that phosphorylation at these sites affects N protein functions. The mechanism needs further investigation. Since the MS/MS method has shortcomings, other possible phosphorylation sites within the N protein cannot be ruled out. These studies will be helpful for understanding the role of the N protein in the PRRSV life cycle.",
