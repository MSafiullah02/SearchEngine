Then, we examine the way organizations interacted to achieve a common goal by employing community analysis of an epidemic response network in Korea in 2015. The results indicate that the network split into two groups: core response communities in one group and supportive functional communities in the other. The core response communities include organizations across government jurisdictions, sectors, and geographic locations. Other communities are confined geographically, homogenous functionally, or both. We also find that whenever intergovernmental relations were present in communities, the member connectivity was low, even if intersectoral relations appeared together within them.",

Therefore, our study focuses on identifying and analyzing communities in the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) response in South Korea as a case study. We address the following research questions: (1) In what way were distinctive communities divided in the ERN? and (2) How did the interorganizational relations relate to the internal characteristics of the communities? By detecting and analyzing the community structure in an ERN, we offer insights for future empirical studies on ERNs.",

The n-cliques can include nodes that are not in the clique but are accessible. Similarly, k-cores refer to maximal subgraphs with a minimum degree of at least k. Many cliques were identified in the Katrina response network, in which federal and state agencies appeared frequently (Comfort & Haase, 2006; Kapucu, 2005) . Using k-cores analysis, Butts, Acton, and Marcum (2012) suggest that the Katrina response network's inner structure was built around a small set of cohesive subgroups that was divided along institutional lines corresponding to five state clusters (Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, and Virginia), a cluster of U.S. federal organizations, and one of nongovernmental organizations. While these studies suggest the presence of cohesive subgroups in ERNs, we have not found any research that thoroughly discussed subsets of organizations' significance in ERNs. From the limited literature, we identify two different, albeit related, reasons that cohesive subgroups have interested ERN researchers.",

While disaster and emergency response plans are inherently limited and not implemented in practice as intended (Clarke, 1999) , stakeholder organizations' responses may be performed together with presumed structures, particularly in a setting in which government entities are predominant. For example, the Incident Command System (ICS) 3 was designed to improve response work's efficiency by constructing a standard operating procedure (Moynihan, 2009 ). Structurally, one person serves as the incident commander who is responsible for directing all other responders (Kapucu & Garayev, 2016) . ICS is a somewhat hierarchical command-and-control system with functional arrangements in five key resources and capabilities-that is, command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance (Kapucu & Garayev, 2016) . In an environment in which such an emergency response model is implemented, it is realistic to expect clusters and subgroups to reflect the model's structural designs and arrangements, and they may be intentionally designed to facilitate coordination, communication, and collaboration with other parts or subgroups efficiently in a large response network.",

During these responses, public organizations in different jurisdictions participate, and a sizable number of organizations from nongovernmental sectors also become involved (Celik & Corbacioglu, 2016; Comfort & Haase, 2006; Kapucu et al., 2010; Spiro, Acton, & Butts, 2013) . Organizational participation by multiple government levels and sectors is often necessary because knowledge, expertise, and resources are distributed in society. Participating organizations must collaborate and coordinate their efforts. However, studies have suggested that interactions in ERNs are limited and primarily occur among similar organizations, particularly within the same jurisdiction. That is, public organizations tend to interact more frequently with other public organizations in specific geographic locations (Butts et al., 2012; Hossain & Kuti, 2010; Kapucu, 2005; Tang, Deng, Shao, & Shen, 2017) . These studies indicate that organizations have been insufficiently integrated across government jurisdictions (Tang et al., 2017) or sectors (Butts et al., 2012; Hossain & Kuti, 2010) , and the identification of cliques composed of similar organizations reinforces such a concern.",

Here, we use the term interorganizational relations to refer to both intergovernmental and intersectoral relations. Intergovernmental relations refer to the interaction among organizations across different government levels (local, provincial, and national) , and intersectoral relations involve the interaction among organizations across different sectors (public, private, nonprofit, and civic sectors). Recent studies have suggested that both intergovernmental and intersectoral relations shape ERNs (Kapucu et al., 2010; Kapucu & Garayev, 2011; Tang et al., 2017) , but few have analyzed the way the two interorganizational relations intertwine. If the relation interdependencies in the entire network are of interest to ERN researchers, as is the case in this article, focusing on cliques may not necessarily be the best approach to the question because clique analysis may continue to find sets of selected organizations that are tightly linked for various reasons.",

First, clique analysis assumes complete connections of three or more subgroup members, while real-world networks tend to have many small overlapping cliques that do not represent distinct groups (Moody & Coleman, 2015) . Even if substantively meaningful cliques appear, they may not necessarily imply a lack of information flow across subgroups or other organizations' exclusion, as previous ERN studies have assumed (Comfort & Haase, 2006; Kapucu et al., 2010) . Second, clique analysis assumes no internal differentiation in members' structural position within the subgroup (Wasserman & Faust, 1994) . In a task-oriented network such as an ERN, organizations within a subgroup may look similar (e.g., all fire organizations). However, this does not imply that they are identical in their structural positions. When these assumptions in clique analysis do not hold, identifying cohesive subgroups as cliques is inappropriate (Wasserman & Faust, 1994) . Similarly, other clique-like approaches (n-cliques and k-cores) demand an answer to the question: \"What is the n-or k-?\" The clique and clique-like approaches have a limited ability to define and identify cohesive subgroups in a task-oriented network because they do not clearly explain why the subgroups need to be defined and identified in such a manner. We proposed a different way of thinking about and finding subsets of organizations in ERNs: community.",

Optimization approaches, such as the Louvain and Leiden methods, which we use in this article, sort nodes into communities by maximizing a clustering objective function (e.g., modularity). Beginning with each node in its own group, the algorithm joins groups together in pairs, choosing the pairs that maximize the increase in modularity (Moody & Coleman, 2015) . This method performs an iterative process of node assignments until modularity is maximized and leads to a hierarchical nesting of nodes (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008) . Recently, the Louvain algorithm was upgraded and improved as the Leiden algorithm that addresses some issues in the Louvain algorithm (Traag, Waltman, & van Eck, 2018) .",

Further, one can exploit complex networks by identifying their community structure. For example, Salath\u00e9 and Jones (2010) showed that community structures in human contact networks significantly influence infectious disease dynamics. Their findings suggest that, in a network with a community structure, targeting individuals who bridge communities for immunization is better than intervening with highly connected individuals.",

It is difficult to know the way communities in ERNs will form beforehand without examining clusters and their compositions and connectivity in the network. We may expect to observe communities that consist of diverse organizations because organizations' shared goal in ERNs is to respond to a crisis by performing necessary tasks (e.g., providing mortuary and medical services as well as delivering materials) through concerted efforts on the part of those with different capabilities (Moynihan, 2009; Waugh, 2003) . Organizations that have different information, skills, and resources may frequently interact in a disruptive situation because one type alone, such as the government or organizations in an affected area, cannot cope effectively with the event (Waugh, 2003) . On the other hand, we also cannot rule out the possibility shown in previous studies (Butts et al., 2012; Comfort & Haase, 2006; Kapucu, 2005) . Organizations that work closely in normal situations because of their task similarity, geographic locations, or jurisdictions may interact more frequently and easily, even in disruptive situations (Hossain & Kuti, 2010) , and communities may be identified that correspond to those factors. A case could be made that communities in ERNs consist of heterogeneous organizations, but a case could also be made that communities are made up of homogeneous organizations with certain characteristics.",

We can expect that, regardless of their types, sectors, and locations, some organizations work and interact closely-perhaps even more so in such a disruptive situation. Emergent needs for coordination, communication, and collaboration also can trigger organizational interactions that extend beyond the usual or planned structure. Thus, the relations among organizations become dense and evolve into the community in which every member is connected. On the other hand, a community in the task network may not require all of the organizations within it to interact. For example, if a presumed structure is strongly established, organizations are more likely to interact with others within the planned structure following the chain of command and control. Even without such a structure, government organizations may coordinate their responses following the existing chain of command and control in their routine. We may expect to observe communities with a sparse connection among organizations. Thus, the way communities emerge in ERNs is an open empirical question that can be answered by examining the entire network.",

In low probability, high-consequence infectious diseases such as the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, a concerted response among individuals and organizations is virtually the only way to respond because countermeasures-such as vaccines-are not readily available. Thus, to achieve an effective response, it is imperative to understand the way individuals and organizations mobilize and respond in public health emergencies. However, the response system for a national or global epidemic is highly complex (Hodge, 2015; Sell et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2015) because of several factors: (1) the large number of organizations across multiple government levels and sectors, (2) the diversity of and interactions among organizations for the necessary (e.g., laboratory testing) or emergent (e.g., hospital closure) tasks, and (3) concurrent outbreaks or treatments at multiple locations attributable to the virus's rapid spread.

Organizations are defined as \"any named entity that represents (directly or indirectly) multiple persons or other entities, and that acts as a de facto decision making unit within the context of the response\" (Butts et al., 2012, p. 6) . If we found an individual's name on behalf of the individual's organization (e.g., the secretary of the Ministry of Health and Welfare), we coded the individual as the organization's representative.

While not absolute, we observe that the network of a dominating organization had a \"mushroom\" shape of interactions with other organizations within the communities (also see Figure  3a ). The dominant organizations were the central government authorities such as the MOHW, the CMMH, and KCDC. The national health authorities led the MERS response. Other remaining communities were (1) confined geographically, (2) oriented functionally, or (3) both. First, some communities consisted of diverse organizations in the areas where two MERS hospitals are located-Seoul Metropolitan city and Gyeonggi Province (Communities 3 and 5). Organizations in these communities span government levels and sectors within the areas affected. Second, two communities consisted of organizations with different functions and performed supportive activities (Community 4, also see Figure 3b ). Other supportive functional communities that focus on health (Community 11, see Figure 3c ) or foreign affairs (Community 15) had a \"spiderweb\" shape of interactions among organizations within the communities. Third, several communities consisted of a relatively small number of organizations connected to one in the center (Communities 16, 17, 18, and 19) . These consisted of local fire organizations in separate jurisdictions (see Figure 3d ) that were both confined geographically and oriented functionally. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the 27 communities in the response network. In Table 2 , we also note distinct interorganizational relations present within the communities. The two core response communities include both intergovernmental and intersectoral relations. 7 That is, organizations across government jurisdictions or sectors were actively involved in response to the epidemic in the communities. While diverse organizations participated in these core communities, the central government agencies led and directed other organizations, which reduced member connectivity.",

Thirdly, within each community of fire organizations in different geographic locations, one provincial or metropolitan fire headquarters was linked to multiple local fire stations in a star network. These communities, labeled IGF, had low member diversity and member connectivity, while they were organizationally and functionally coherent. Table 3 summarizes the results elaborated above. In addition to the division of communities along the lines of the nature of their response activities, we observe that the structural characteristics of communities with only intersectional or international relations showed high diversity and high connectivity.

The large data sets available and increased computational power significantly transform the study of social networks and can shed light on topics such as cohesive subgroups in large networks. Network studies today involve mining enormous digital data sets such as collective behavior online (Hagen et al., 2018) , an e-mail corpus of a million messages (Tyler, Wilkinson, & Buberman, 2005) , or scholars' massive citation data (Kim & Zhang, 2016) . The scale of ERNs in large disasters and emergencies is noteworthy (Moynihan, 2009; Waugh, 2003) , and over 1,000 organizations appeared in Butts et al. (2012) study as well as in this research. Their connections reflect both existing structural forms by design and by emergent needs. The computational power needed to analyze such large relational data is ever higher and the methods simpler now, which allows us to learn about the entire network. We find two important results. First, the national public health ERN in Korea split largely into two groups. The core response communities' characteristics were that (1) they were not confined geographically, (2) organizations were heterogeneous across jurisdictional lines as well as sectors, and (3) the community's internal structure was sparse even if intersectoral relations were present. On the other hand, supportive functional communities' characteristics were that (1) they were communities of heterogeneous organizations in the areas affected that were confined geographically; (2) the communities of intersectoral, professional organizations were heterogeneous, densely connected, and not confined geographically; and (3) the communities of traditional emergency response organizations (e.g., fire) were confined geographically, homogeneous, and connected sparsely in a centralized fashion.",

This observation does not speak to the quality of interactions in the centralized top-down structure, but one can also ask how effective such a structure can be in a setting where diverse organizations must share authority, responsibilities, and resources. Second, infectious diseases spread rapidly and can break out in multiple locations simultaneously. The subgroup patterns in response networks to infectious diseases can differ from those of location-bound natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. While some organizations may not be actively or directly involved in the response, communities of these organizations can be formed to prepare for potential outbreaks or provide support to the core response communities during the event. Second, we also find that the communities' internal characteristics (diversity and connectivity) differed depending upon the types of interorganizational relations that appeared within the communities.

The answer remains unclear, but the recent opinion leans toward a less centralized and hierarchical structure, given the complexity of making decisions in disruptive situations (Brooks, Bodeau, & Fedorowicz, 2013; Comfort, 2007; Hart, Rosenthal, & Kouzmin, 1993) . Our analysis shows clearly that the community structure and structures within communities in the network were highly centralized (several mushrooms) and led by central government organizations. Given that the response to the outbreak was severely criticized for its poor communication and lack of coordination, it might be beneficial to include more flexibility and openness in the response system in future events.

Some algorithms take deterministic group finding approaches that partition the network based on betweenness centrality edges (Girvan & Newman, 2002) or information centrality edges (Fortunato et al., 2004) . Other algorithms take the optimization approaches we use in this article. In our side analyses, we tested three algorithms with the same data set: G-N, Louvain, and Leiden. The modularity scores were consistent, as reported in this article, but the number of communities in G-N and the other two algorithms differed. The deterministic group finding approach (G-N) found a substantively high number of communities. The modularity score can help make sense of the partition initially, but the approach is limited (Reichardt & Bornholdt, 2006) . Thus, two questions remain: which algorithm do we choose and how do we know whether the community structure is robust (Karrer, Levina, & Newman, 2008) ? In their nature, these questions do not differ from which statistical model to use given the assumptions and types of data in hand. The algorithms also require further examination and tests.",

Government documents may provide richer information about the government's actions but less so about other social endeavors. Media data, such as newspapers, also have their limitations as information sources to capture rich social networks. Accordingly, our results must be interpreted in the context of these limitations.",
