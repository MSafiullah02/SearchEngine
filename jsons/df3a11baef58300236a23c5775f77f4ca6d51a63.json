A 35 survey conducted in China showed that 53.8% of the respondents rated the psychological impact 36 of the outbreak as moderate or severe, and 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms 37 and stress levels. 1 During pregnancy, women may experience stress and anxiety associated with 38 potential adverse obstetrical outcomes such as fetal death or fetal abnormalities. Stress and 39 anxiety level may also increase during infectious disease outbreaks. Currently, there is no known 40 information on the psychological impact, the effect on individual's social and/or psychological 41 aspects, and mental health of pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic. 42 The aim of this study was to survey pregnant women to evaluate psychological impact, and 43 anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. 46 This was a cross-sectional survey study aimed to assess the psychological response of pregnant 47 women during the epidemic of COVID-19. The study was conducted at University of Naples 48 Federico II (Napoli, Italy), from March 15, 2020 to April 1, 2020. Women with singleton 49 pregnancies were eligible to participate in the study regardless of the gestational age.",

More than two third of the women also reported anxiety higher than the 110 normal. Almost half of the women (46%) reported high anxiety regarding the vertical 111 transmission of the disease, assessed as VAS for anxiety scored >50. Sensitivity analyses 112 according to gestational age, showed that women in the first trimester of pregnancy during the 113 COVID-19 epidemic, had higher anxiety and much severe phycological impact compared to 114 those in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. 115 We also found that 52.9% of the women who were in the first trimester during the COVID-19 116 outbreak opted for the cell-free DNA as first-trimester risk assessment compared to the 117 combined screening. This quite high rate of non-invasive prenatal testing, may be explained by 118 the fact that first-trimester risk assessment for trisomy 21 with cell-free DNA is associated with 119 better maternal reassurance and less anxiety compared to the standard first-trimester combined 120 screening based on nuchal trasclucency. Out of the 18 women who delivered during the study 121 period, we reported a 16.7% rate of cesarean delivery on maternal request. This rate is 122 significantly higher compared to the 5-10% rate reported in the literature. 5 Notably, anxiety for 123 fetal injury or fetal death, and emotional aspects, are two of main reasons for planned cesarean 124 delivery on maternal request. 6 However, assessment of the rate of cell-free DNA and of mode of 125 delivery was limited to a very small subgroups according to gestational age at the time of study 126 period, and therefore the study was not powered for these two analyses.",

So far, 131 the COVID-19 has caused thousands of deaths around the globe. Fear and phycological impact 132 of the disease may be as harmful as the infection, with also suicidal cases reported.133 Pregnancy is a well-known period of profound change. Adequate mental and physical health is a 134 protective factor for mood disorders, and for some women, pregnancy may increase vulnerability 135 to psychiatric disease like depression. Antenatal depression affects about 10% of women in the 136 developed countries, and the number of pregnant women prescribed antidepressants has 137 increased over the last decade 7 Isolation, social distancing, and extreme changes in daily life may 138 increase the risk of depression among vulnerable population such as pregnant women. Therefore, 139 it is of paramount importance to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak.140 Conclusion 141 In summary, among pregnant women, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological 142 impact of COVID-19 outbreak as severe, and about two third reported anxiety higher than the 143 normal. Almost half of the women reported high anxiety regarding the vertical transmission of 144 the disease. Psychological impact and anxiety of the COVID-19 epidemic seems to be more 145 severe in women who are in the first trimester of pregnancy during the outbreak.
