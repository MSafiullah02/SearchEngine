These events have formed part of the wider \u2018riskscape\u2019 that humans have learned to manage and live with. However, more recently the impacts of disasters have increased substantially, partly because of the exacerbating effects of climate change, but also due to the growing complexity of socio-ecological systems in a highly connected and globalized world (Becken, Mahon, Rennie, & Shakeela, 2014). For instance, the year 2017 recorded a series of hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) in the Caribbean and a severe earthquake in Mexico, amongst other events, and these resulted in the highest incurred losses ever recorded (US$ 135 billion) (Munich, 2018).",

The nature and extent of impacts depend on the type of shock and the resilience of the affected system (OECD, 2014). Most disasters have profound impacts on individuals, organizations and communities, and consequently on tourism activities. The repercussions of a disaster are likely to affect tourism directly at a destination country, but indirect consequences for travel to and from the affected region are also conceivable (Jin, Qu & Bap. 2019; Ruan, Quan & Liu, 2017). Understanding, managing and responding to these risks, therefore, has to be an integral component of sustainable tourism management (Shakeela & Becken, 2015). Consequently, it is not surprising that the topic of risk management and disaster mitigation is attracting increasing attention in tourism research. An emerging body of literature has provided both theoretical and empirical insights into multiple aspects of disasters and tourism.",

In particular, academics and practitioners have been interested in how sustainable development and marketing strategies should include plans to prepare, protect and rebuild a destination after a disaster, both in terms of physical assets and destination image (Aljerf & Choukaife, 2016; Okuyama, 2018). The perceptions of safety is an important aspect of destination image, and different types of risks and events have been studied in the context of visitor travel information seeking and decision making (Sharifpour, Walters, Ritchie, & Winter, 2014; Trumbo et al., 2016; Williams & Bal\u00e1\u017e, 2015). Re-establishing public perceptions of safety and attractiveness following a disaster is crucial to attract and reassure potential visitors to travel to the destination and, by doing so, assisting the affected area to regain functionality and economic recovery (WTTC, 2018). In addition to understanding visitor perceptions, it has been found that addressing risk perceptions and behaviours of relevant tourism stakeholder is critical for effective disaster response and recovery (Kozak, Crotts, & Law, 2007; Park & Reisinger, 2010).",

However, empirical research that confirms or quantifies the relationship between disasters and tourism activity is scant. Existing studies have taken a case study approach (e.g. for Chinese outbound tourism, see Jin, Qu, & Bao, 2019), but a global analysis is missing (Ghaderi, Mat Som, & Henderson, 2014; J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, 2011; Mazzocchi & Montini, 2001; Ruci\u0144ska & Lechowicz, 2014). It is therefore timely to undertake a global study that uses a consistent approach to measuring the impact of disasters on international tourism movements. To increase the value of such a study for tourism managers, it needs to be designed in a way that includes a wide range of disaster types and magnitudes in the same model (Ghimire, 2016).",

To that end, this research integrates two different global datasets, namely one on disasters and another one on bilateral international tourist flows. A gravity model for international tourism flows is defined to quantify the effects of different disaster events on international tourist arrivals to the affected country. More precisely, we analyze the impact of droughts, earthquakes (ground movements and tsunamis), epidemics, cold and heat waves, floods, industrial accidents, landslides, wildfires, storms and volcanic activities. Moreover, we use three different proxies to measure the impact of disasters; namely the number of deaths, affected people and economic costs. Results will support the tourism sector and other key players (e.g. international insurance companies) in developing adequate responses to managing risk and recovery. To the best of our knowledge, the present research is the first attempt to undertake such an integrated analysis at a global scale.",

Several examples in the literature provide empirical evidence of reductions in tourist arrivals following major events. For instance, Mazzocchi and Montini (2001) evaluated the impact on visitation to the Umbria region in Central Italy, following a major earthquake in September 1997. The data showed that arrivals fell drastically the first month after the main shock, with ongoing loss in tourism activity being recorded until June 1998. A case study of a volcanic eruption at the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland on 14th March 2010 showed that tourism numbers to Iceland reduced by 49% until 28th April 2011 (J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, 2011). Huang and Min (2002) analyzed the Taiwan earthquake in September 1999, using an integrated moving average model to explore the recovery process. Their study revealed that the island's inbound arrivals had not yet fully recovered from the earthquake's devastation after 11 months. Kuo, Chen, Tseng, Ju, and Huang (2008) also used a time series model to investigate the impacts of infectious diseases, including Avian Flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome, on international tourist arrivals in Asia. The empirical results indicated that the numbers of affected cases had a significant impact in the case of SARS (see also Mao, Ding, & Lee, 2010; McAleer, Huang, Kuo, Chen, & Chang, 2010), but for Avian Flu.",

Prominent examples include airports and ports, land transport infrastructure, and electricity and telecommunication networks (Ghobarah, Saatcioglu, & Nistor, 2006; Parajuli & Haynes, 2006).

Gravity models are commonly used in the trade literature (Anderson, 2011), and increasingly in tourism research (Fourie, Rossell\u00f3-Nadal, & Santana-Gallego, 2019; Khadaroo & Seetanah, 2008; Santeramo & Morelli, 2015). These models consider that international flows between two countries are directly proportional to their economic size, and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Consequently, the level of bilateral tourism flows can be explained by a set of determining variables as in a demand equation. Morley et al., 2014 have shown that gravity models to explain bilateral tourism can be derived from consumer choice theory. Accordingly, the formulation of a gravity model can also be interpreted as a tourism demand equation.",

The increase in the variance of the coefficient estimates could drive them to be unstable and difficult to interpret. Consequently, our first strategy is to consider the three impact metrics (i.e. deaths, affected people and cost) separately in different equations. Additionally, for each of the three metrics, we evaluate the possibility to distribute the effects within 6 and 12 months. This results in 6 specifications: three for each of the impacts, times the two evaluation periods (6 and 12 months).",

In other words, we integrate the three impact metrics into a single equation.

For all types of disasters, and when economic costs are considered, a negative and significant relationship is found.

Wildfires appear as the second most detrimental type of disaster when measured in economic damage, leading to an expected fall of 0.03% of tourist arrivals for every million US$ cost associated with the disaster. Interestingly and perhaps paradoxically, a significant positive relationship is evident between the number of people affected by Wildfires and tourist arrivals. For every million affected people, an increase between 0.34% and 0.35% is expected. Consequently, and considering the negative effect of economic damage mentioned above, the net effect of Wildfires on tourism should consider the two different types of disaster impact measures. Earthquakes show a similar negative impact compared with Tsunamis (see above) in terms of the economic costs of the disaster, with falls around 0.002% for every million US$ cost. However, the other impact metrics do not show a negative relationship. In terms of number of fatalities, there is even an increase in tourism for the number of deaths per 1000 people by 0.002%. Thus, the overall impact of an earthquake is a combination of decreases in response to economic damage and number of deaths. Industrial Accidents and Storms show similar patterns in that there is a positive relationship between the number of fatalities and affected people, but a negative relationship between the economic impact of the disaster and tourism arrivals. For example, for Storms there is a decrease in arrivals by 0.003% for every million US$ cost but increases between 0.018% and 0.024% for every death/1000 people and between 0.018%-0.024% and 0.03\u20130.04% for every million people affected.",

Overall, it is less likely that drought conditions produce direct impacts on tourism-relevant infrastructures and supplies, as tourism businesses might absorb the extra costs of supplying water during water constrained times.

Examples include the implementation of appropriate building codes, zoning regulations, and emergency training and preparedness for key stakeholders. New policies and practices may require additional resources, but investments into preparedness are likely to generate positive returns in the long term. In general, the empirical results in this paper confirm that disaster events are challenging news for tourism managers who need to deal with an unexpected fall in tourism demand. Clearly, economic damage from an unexpected event leads to some reductions in tourist arrivals. In those cases, efforts by destination managers should focus on the recovery of necessary infrastructure and business capability. Proactive planning, for example around business continuity, business support networks, and recovery assistance programs, could accelerate this effort (Hystad & Keller, 2008). Leadership may come from government agencies, destination management organizations, or businesses themselves. Related research in New Zealand revealed that leadership is \u201cmainly provided by tourism stakeholders with a community-value orientation, and to a lesser extent by those who are mainly business-driven\u201d (Hughey & Becken, 2016, p. 69).

Future research should further explore this matter and investigate if differences among countries in reference to their level of development exist. Our attempt to discriminate the different disaster by region did not obtain significant results. Future research on the positive impacts of certain types of disaster consequences would also be beneficial in developing a potential tourist typology consisting of \u2018dark tourism\u2019 segments, humanitarian arrivals or other presently unidentified markets.",
