Diverse safeguard systems are available to detect and defend against invading pathogens. Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, cells transmit intracellular signals to trigger immediate proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses [1]. These innate immune responses are the first line of defense in the early phase of infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Nod-like receptors, and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors are representative families of innate immune receptors that distinguish microbial products as \u2018non-self\u2019 molecules [2].",

Surface-exposed TLRs mainly detect bacterial products, while TLRs located in intracellular compartments recognize nucleic acids [1]. RIG-I mediates antiviral signaling by sensing viral RNA and subsequently interacting with the central antiviral signaling protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) [5]. This signaling cascade ultimately leads to the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) and other antiviral molecules [5], [6]. All these innate immune responses orchestrate the early host response to infection, which subsequently activates and shapes the adaptive immune response [1], [7]. The adaptive immune system controls the late phase of infection and generates immunological memory through T cell- or B cell-mediated (humoral) mechanisms [8], [9].",

The induction, maintenance, and termination of host immune responses to infection must be tightly controlled [10]. Turning off the immune system is as important as turning it on to avoid unwanted immune responses. Several positive and negative regulatory mechanisms control the immune response through a complex signaling network [11], [12], [13]. A number of endogenous proteins that either enhance or limit the magnitude and duration of the inflammatory response regulate this system. These non-immune proteins serve as a second safeguard system by fine-tuning host immune responses and ensuring cellular homeostasis. For example, a mitochondrial import receptor protein, Tom7, positively regulates MAVS signaling by serving as a critical adaptor linking MAVS to downstream signaling molecules that activate antiviral immunity [14]. Alternatively, cells have developed diverse strategies to halt antiviral signaling through MAVS [15]. Several E3 ligases, including E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (ITCH), Smurf1, Gp78, and TRIM25, have been shown to accelerate MAVS degradation after viral infection [16], [17], [18]. Collectively, cells employ multiple mechanisms to regulate immunity against microbial invaders, with the help of non-immunogenic proteins to prevent uncontrolled cellular damage.",

Phosphorylation is the most frequent PTM occurring in ARS proteins, and it is thought to induce structural changes that may drive their dissociation from the MSC and/or allow for new interacting partners [30]. It is well established that the Ser886 and Ser999 residues of the EPRS WHEP domains are sequentially phosphorylated in response to IFN-\u03b3 stimulation. IFN-\u03b3 induces phosphorylation of EPRS at Ser886 by activating cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and indirectly induces phosphorylation at Ser999 via a distinct kinase [31]. This promotes the dissociation of EPRS from the MSC, and subsequently promotes its association with the IFN-\u03b3-activated inhibition of translation (GAIT) complex [32]. The heterotetrameric GAIT complex, including EPRS, binds to distinct 3\u2032-untranslated regions of mRNAs involved in chronic inflammation to suppress their translation [33]. RNA virus infection-specific phosphorylation was also identified at the EPRS Ser990 residue [20]. This modification was critical for dissociation of EPRS from the MSC and activation of antiviral signaling [20].",

In the case of KRS, allergen stimulation of activated mast cells results in phosphorylation of KRS at Ser207 in a MAPK-dependent manner [35]. Signaling through MAPK kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular-related kinase (ERK), but not p38 MAPK, was critical for the KRS phosphorylation. Ultimately, this phosphorylation triggered dissociation of KRS from the MSC and its translocation into the nucleus, where it controls the level of diadenosine tetraphosphate [36], an important signaling molecule in microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) transcriptional activity [37]. Therefore, KRS phosphorylation might be induced directly by infection-related MAPK signaling or indirectly by infection-induced products like cytokines, which can activate multiple regulatory pathways.",

ARSs are ubiquitous and abundant proteins; therefore, transient changes in their expression may not significantly affect global protein synthesis. Alteration of TRS and AlaRS expression does not markedly alter global protein synthesis [38]. PTMs located in the additional domains of vertebrate ARSs do not affect aminoacylation of these enzymes [20], [33]. However, PTMs of residues located in the catalytic core domain can influence the enzymatic activities of ARSs. Phosphorylation of MRS at Ser662, which is located in the critical tRNA-binding site, significantly down-regulates global translation by inactivating methionine-charging activity until damaged DNA is repaired [39]. By looking at the distinct transcriptional and protein expression profiles of ARSs, as well as the dynamics of their regulation by PTMs, novel, infection-specific roles for individual ARSs will be elucidated. Future studies should investigate whether changes in the expression and PTMs of each ARS upon infection correlate with its canonical tRNA aminoacylation activity and global protein synthesis as well as with its non-canonical functions.",

We found that the MSC immediately senses invasion by RNA viruses and activates EPRS to promote antiviral immunity via its infection-specific phosphorylation and release from the MSC [20]. EPRS knockdown in macrophages increased the replication of the RNA viruses influenza A virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, and reduced the production of antiviral cytokines. Conversely, ectopically expressed EPRS in macrophages significantly attenuated viral replication and increased antiviral IFN-\u03b2 production. Moreover, RNA viruses were much more lethal in EPRS+/\u2212 haploid mice due to the high rates of viral replication and weak antiviral cytokine responses. Intriguingly, infection with RNA viruses led to a previously unreported phosphorylation of EPRS at Ser990 that triggers the release of EPRS from the MSC. This phosphorylation was not induced by IFN-\u03b3, and thus the released EPRS was not involved in the GAIT system. Instead, the EPRS associated with poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), a well-known negative regulator of MAVS that mediates its degradation via ubiquitin ligase ITCH [13] after release from the MSC. Ultimately, the phosphorylated EPRS protected MAVS from PCBP2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, and the stabilized MAVS activated antiviral immunity.",

AIMP1 potentiates the link between innate and adaptive immunity by activating NK cells [45] and B cells [46] and by promoting IL-12-mediated T-helper type 1 (TH1) cell immunity [47]. AIMP1 expression in BMDCs directly promoted TH1 cell polarization, which is characterized by the secretion of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 from antigen-presenting cells and T cells, respectively, and is associated with the generation of cell-mediated adaptive immune responses [48]. These adaptive responses were critical for effective clearance of intracellular infections as well as antitumor immunity [49], [50]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of AIMP1\u2212/\u2212 BMDCs impaired the secretion of the TH1 polarizing cytokine IL-12p70, but secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 was not changed.

Microarray analysis of WT and AIMP1\u2212/\u2212 BMDCs suggested its close correlation to the expression of antiviral genes. Challenge of AIMP1\u2212/\u2212 mice with influenza A virus (H3N2) by aerosol spray resulted in 100% lethality, whereas WT mice showed only 20% lethality at a high infectious dose [a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of 20] per mouse at 2 weeks post-infection. A sub-lethal dose of 7.50 TCID50 per mouse still caused 60% mortality among AIMP1\u2212/\u2212 mice, while all WT mice survived. Evaluation of survivors indicated that the levels of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly reduced in AIMP1\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 7 post-infection. Moreover, IFN-\u03b3+ T cells in the lung and levels of IgG2a (the TH1-specific antibody isotype) in the serum were highly reduced in AIMP1 knockout mice on day 15 post-infection. By varying the titers of infectious virus and investigating different time-points, this study revealed that AIMP1 deficiency can lead to insufficient innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses in vivo\n[21]. This was the first report on the role of MSC components in adaptive immunity during sequential phases of virus infection. However, further studies will be necessary to determine whether dissociation of AIMP1 from the MSC and its secretion by cells are required for its function against viral infection. Whether AIMP1 functions differently in intracellular and extracellular environments in infection should also be addressed by future studies. Such molecular details will strengthen the interrelated roles of AIMP1 in innate and adaptive immunity in infectious disease.",

WRS was secreted from monocytes upon infection and directly bound to the TLR4-MD2 complex on macrophages to activate phagocytosis and chemokine production. WRS seems to function prior to the full activation of the immune response in infected cells. Its secretion occurred relatively early, at around 15 min post-infection, which is much earlier than TNF-\u03b1 production, which could be first detected at 120 min [22].

In the case of vaccinia virus, its replication and progeny assembly take place exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells at distinct foci termed viral factories or virosomes, which are enriched in viral DNA and proteins [57]. Interestingly, MSC was recruited to these active viral translation sites in vaccinia virus-infected cells [58]. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that MSC proteins (KRS, MRS, and EPRS) and some free ARSs (SRS and YRS) are largely recruited to the viral factories [58]. Moreover, upregulation of diverse ARS genes after flavivirus infection in mice brain implies that host ARSs may be used by viruses for their propagation, based on the observation that flavivirus does not shut off host protein synthesis and therefore must compete with the cellular translational machinery for limiting factors [26].",

            "text": "Although the substrate specificity of ARS is sequence-dependent, several studies revealed that ARSs can recognize plant viral RNAs with different sequences from those of tRNAs [59]. Some viral RNAs have adopted structures that mimic those of tRNA, which increases the efficiency of their genomic RNA translation. tRNA-like structures (TLSs) have been found at the 3\u2032 end of RNAs from eight genera of plant viruses [60], including turnip yellow mosaic virus [61], brome mosaic virus [62], and tobacco mosaic virus [63]. These TLSs can be aminoacylated specifically on valine, tyrosine, and histidine [64]. This mimetic activity is strategically valuable to viruses for evading the host\u2019s immune system as well as increasing their translational efficiency [65]. Structural analysis showed that the viral TLS can bind to ARS, eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A), and the ribosome, implying that the tRNA mimicry functions as a translation enhancer and a means of protecting the 3\u2032 end of viral genomic RNA [66]. Similarly, a 32-nucleotide RNA motif in the genome of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus formed a similar structure with the GAIT element that can selectively interact with EPRS [67], [68]. The sequence of this viral RNA motif showed a high identity with a known GAIT element that interacts with the first and second linker regions in the WHEP domains of EPRS [40]. Direct binding of EPRS to the viral GAIT-like RNA motif inhibited the translation of this viral RNA motif in vitro\n[68]. Interestingly, the viral GAIT-like RNA motif affected the host melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. Although disruption of this GAIT-like RNA motif did not affect viral growth, the innate immune response was exacerbated through MDA5 activation, indicating that this motif interferes with the host defense system by blocking the accessibility of EPRS to host sensors of viral RNA [68].",

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) uses the specific tRNALys3 to initiate reverse transcriptase-catalyzed synthesis of minus-strand DNA [70]. During viral assembly, human KRS was found to be selectively packaged into HIV-1 virions via direct interaction with the viral Gag protein, and a truncated KRS associated with the tRNALys packaging was found within the virion [70], [71], [72]. Gag codes for core structural proteins of the virus, which are the fundamental building blocks of the retrovirus particle [73]. The source of viral KRS has been a topic of significant investigation. One study showed that the incorporation of KRS into HIV-1 virions occurs rapidly and is sensitive to the inhibition of newly synthesized KRS [72]. Another study suggested that HIV-1 uses host mitochondrial KRS during the packaging process [74]. Because KRS is normally associated with the MSC, HIV-1 could exploit the dynamic nature of the MSC to redirect and co-opt cellular translation factors [75]. Indeed, HIV-1 infection triggers release of KRS from the MSC, possibly through phosphorylation at Ser207 [75]. This PTM is important for KRS packaging into virions and progeny virus infectivity [75]. The free pool of KRS translocates to the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, although the relevance of nuclear KRS for viral infectivity is not yet entirely clear [75].",

They are secreted as either full-length or truncated forms generated by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage and exhibit activity in cytokine signaling pathways [91], [92]. For instance, under apoptotic conditions, YRS is secreted and cleaved into two distinct cytokines by an elastase, yielding an N-terminal catalytic domain (mini-YRS) and a C-terminal endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAPII)-like domain [87], [93]. The latter showed potent chemotactic activity for leukocytes and monocytes and stimulated the production of myeloperoxidase, TNF-\u03b1, and tissue factor, whereas mini-YRS functioned as an IL-8-like cytokine via its Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif, which is critical for polymorphonuclear leukocyte receptor binding [87].",

However, the YGY sequence of WRS was not essential for its angiostatic cytokine activity, but instead was important for maintaining structural stability. Alternatively, the Glu-His-Arg (EHR)-containing eight-residue motif (aa 382\u2013389) in mini-WRS was directly involved in its angiostatic activity [94]. Whether the EHR motif of WRS affects binding to chemokine receptors and activates signal transduction should be investigated.",

The secreted KRS bound to monocytes and macrophages to induce immune responses through the ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. TNF-\u03b1 but not TGF-\u03b2 induced the release of endogenous KRS from cells [89]. Interestingly, Shiga toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae and a subset of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli\n[95] triggered the dissociation of KRS from the MSC and its secretion by macrophages [96]. The secreted KRS contributed to Shiga toxin-mediated inflammatory signals by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from target cells. This study showed that a bacteria-derived virulence factor could use KRS as a cytokine to synergistically exacerbate inflammatory responses in the host. HRS secreted in its full-length form [97] induced lymphocyte migration and activated monocytes and immature dendritic cells through CCR5 binding [98].",

Although the mechanisms underlying ARS secretion have not been fully elucidated, recent studies showed that GRS and KRS are released via exosomes [104], [105]. Application of an exosome pathway inhibitor (e.g., GW4869) or an ER-Golgi pathway inhibitor (e.g., brefeldin A) is a potential strategy to control ARS secretion and attenuate excessive inflammation induced by infection.

Currently, clinical approaches to treat acute infections depend mainly on the use of antibiotics or antiviral drugs. Host-directed therapies to augment anti-infective responses are greatly needed [107]. ARSs that have bioactive roles in anti-infectious signaling represent potential candidates to enhance host defense. Our group showed that an EPRS-derived peptide has potential as a therapeutic agent against a broad range of RNA viruses [20]. A domain mapping study of EPRS showed that the EPRS L1 region (aa 168\u2013196) was critical for protection of MAVS from PCBP2-mediated ubiquitination and activation of antiviral type I IFN signaling [20]. Based on this observation, an antiviral peptide called Tat-Epep was designed by fusing the EPRS L1 region to the cell-permeable HIV-1 Tat tag. Treatment of macrophages with Tat-Epep increased their production of antiviral cytokines and reduced RNA viral replication in vitro. Tat-Epep was shown to increase MAVS stability by inhibiting the negative regulation of PCBP2 in cells. To further examine the antiviral mechanism of Tat-Epep, structure-based modifications of the peptide should be introduced for optimization, and its activity should be functionally validated in vivo.",

Analyzing gene expression profiles from virus-infected human blood showed that different pathogens elicited distinct host RNA signatures [113]. Host proteins involved in immune responses can also be an indicator of infection, and elevated levels of these factors can provide useful clinical information in the context of infectious disease. For example, detection of the concentrations of three proteins, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP), could be used to discriminate between bacterial and viral diseases and reduce antibiotic misuse [114].

WRS was detected in supernatants from PBMC cultures 2 h after bacterial infection, while HMGB1 was not detected during this period [22]. This result suggested that, compared with HMGB1, which is secreted at a relatively late stage (at 12 h) after exposure to pathogens [116], WRS may be used as an early biomarker of infection [22]. Moreover, while HMGB1 is released in response to numerous inflammatory signals in addition to infection [115], WRS secretion is dependent on the presence of infection, which differentiates sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Therefore, WRS may be a useful diagnostic tool for infectious diseases including sepsis without the necessity of detecting pathogenic antigens in patient serum.",

Although the exact underlying mechanism for this syndrome is unknown, it seems to occur after certain viral infections or exposure to certain drugs [119]. Indeed, infectious agents are thought to induce autoimmunity once self-tolerance is broken [120]. For example, infectious myositis, one of the symptoms of antisynthetase syndrome, is an acute, subacute, or chronic infection of skeletal muscle caused by viruses including HIV, bacteria, fungi, and parasites [121].

For purification of human ARSs as antigens, specific design is required to minimize cross-reactivity with pathogenic ARSs that contain conserved catalytic regions. Determination of antigenicity and specificity based on the host ARS sequence and structure should improve ARS detection [30]. Several ARS antibodies and sandwich ELISA systems are commercially available, but most utilize polyclonal antibodies and are quite expensive, and the sensitivities are not sufficient for use with human serum samples, which have high levels of background [122]. To overcome this low resolution, new diagnostic tools such as protein chips should be developed to identify multiple ARSs simultaneously [123]. PCR-based methods to detect host ARSs can also be used due to their high sensitivity and specificity [124]. The rational design of discriminative primers for human ARSs will promote the timely diagnosis of infections. Moreover, in addition to secreted ARSs, examining the host ARS proteome or genome signature in cells isolated from patient peripheral blood or tissues will help correlate the abnormal expression of ARSs with infections [125], [126], [127].",

            "text": "Inhibition of protein synthesis by targeting tRNA aminoacylation has proven to be an effective strategy for anti-pathogenic drug development [128]. The catalytic domain of ARS has three distinct binding pockets responsible for recognition of amino acids, adenylate, and tRNA moieties [129]. Based on these substrate-binding sites, three classes of ARS inhibitors have been explored. While some inhibitors target a single specific pocket, many bind to one or more sites within the catalytic domain or the separate editing domain. Firstly, amino acid analogs can act as competitors for particular amino acids in ARS domains. Halofuginone binds to the proline- and tRNA-binding sites of PRS, and thereby inhibits its enzymatic activity and has been used as an herbal medicine to treat malaria [130], [131], [132]. Other biosynthetic products include indolmycin/chuangxinmycin (tryptophan analogs), cispentacin/icofungipen (an isoleucine analog), ochratoxin A (a phenylalanine analog), and SB219383 (a tyrosine analog), although they have not been used as therapeutic agents because of their poor antibacterial activity and low specificity [133]. Developing compounds that mimic aminoacyl-adenylate (AA-AMP) intermediate or bind to AA-AMP pockets may also be a powerful strategy [134]. Mupirocin is a mimetic of isoleucyl-AMP, which occupies the AA-AMP-binding site [135]. It is a very successful ARS inhibitor, exhibiting a high degree of specificity to several species of bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and Bacillus subtilis\n[135]. The clinical use of mupirocin validates the idea that ARSs can be effective antibiotic targets in human patients. Lastly, AN2690 inhibits fungal LRS by forming a tRNALeu-AN2690 adduct in the editing site [136]. It traps the 3\u2032-end A76 nucleotide of tRNA, thus inhibiting subsequent rounds of aminoacylation. Interestingly, borrelidin acts as a triple competitive inhibitor [137]. Co-crystal structures of borrelidin with TRS showed that borrelidin simultaneously occupied four distinct subsites, including substrate-binding sites for amino acids, ATP, and tRNAThr, and an additional binding site [137].",

Anacor also used a combinatorial screening of a boron-containing small molecule library and discovered a novel synthetic inhibitor, AN2690, that inhibited fungal LRS [142].

This technique could especially be applied to ARS inhibitors since the architecture of ARS catalytic domains is structurally conserved throughout evolution. The low amount of variation in the ARS active domains suggests that targeting bacterial ARSs may be a broad strategy for use against a range of pathogens, but selectivity between eukaryotic and prokaryotic ARSs might be difficult to achieve. As enzymes, the core structures of ARSs without additional domains (which are usually present in higher eukaryotes) are readily soluble, and many of their unique structures are publicly available in the Protein Data Bank. Atomic-level characterization with structure-guided drug design is critical for developing and modifying ARS-based drugs. Co-crystallization of ARSs and inhibitors clearly shows how small compounds can potently control ARS function across a variety of species. The detailed structural and functional analysis of binding between the natural product borrelidin and TRS is a good example [137]. The authors determined the crystal structures of both human and E. coli TRS in complex with borrelidin and found that borrelidin has potent and redundant mechanisms to inhibit TRS during protein synthesis. This study revealed that borrelidin acted as a quadrivalent inhibitor by filling three substrate-binding sites and an extra space through its extended macrolide ring [137].",

Instead of resolving the co-crystal of an ARS and its inhibitor experimentally, new computational algorithms and approaches for modeling ARS drug interactions have become indispensable and time-saving tools [143]. Several bioinformatics tools are available to explore sequence and structure-derived enzyme active site residues to annotate drug inserts [143]. In silico methods including virtual screening and structure-based drug design have been used to design ARS inhibitors targeting LRS, WRS, NRS, MRS, IRS, and TRS [144], [145], [146]. The inhibitory activities of these compounds must be confirmed. Moreover, ARS substrate-based modification such as exploiting the structure of tRNA can be considered. Trana Discovery has developed a modern bioinformatics tool to conduct detailed analyses of tRNAs and employed a high-throughput screening system with a fluorescent probe mimicking the T-loop region to identify novel drugs that bind at the anticodon stem loop region of tRNAs to inhibit pathogen growth [147]. In addition, despite the structural homology, specific sequence differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ARSs can be used to design discriminating and specific ARS-targeted drugs. For example, the successful application of mupirocin is derived from a mere two-amino-acid difference between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ARS [148]. Mutational analysis of amino acid residues will further characterize the critical sites involved in the interactions between ARSs and their inhibitors.",

Although mupirocin has been used to treat methicillin-resistant S. aureus clinically at a MIC of \u22644 \u03bcg/ml, this strain appears to have evolved two types of resistance to mupirocin [150]. First, point mutations in the targeted S. aureus IRS led to the development of low-level (mupirocin MIC \u2264 8\u201364 \u03bcg/ml) antibiotic resistance, while horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes (mupA, which encodes an alternate IRS, or mupB, which contains common IRS motifs) from either eukaryotes or other bacteria caused high-level resistance (mupirocin MIC \u2265 512 \u03bcg/ml) [151]. Additionally, although the MRS inhibitors were potent against a large number of pathogenic strains such as S. aureus and Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited a wide range of susceptibility to these compounds [140]. S. pneumoniae strains encoding a second, distantly related MRS enzyme called MRS2 are resistant to synthetically derived inhibitors, including REP8839 [141].

            "text": "Many ARS inhibitors are naturally produced by several microbes. Because biosynthesized ARS inhibitors can be toxic to their sources by targeting their own ARSs, bacteria that produce ARS inhibitors require self-immunity. Here, self-immunity is defined as a resistance system against antimicrobial compounds that can kill related bacteria. Ironically, plasmids encoding these resistance genes (usually genes encoding secondary ARSs) are readily transmissible by conjugation and confer polymicrobial resistance. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens produces mupirocin by quorum sensing to kill competitor bacteria in the local environment [152]. P. fluorescens protects itself by expressing the mupM gene, which encodes a second IRS. Transfer of P. fluorescens mupM to E. coli induced resistance to mupirocin [153]. Similarly, the Agrobacterium radiobacter strain K84 produces agrocin 84, which inhibits a plant pathogen, A. tumefaciens C58 [154]. Immunity to agrocin 84 is conferred by the agnB2 gene, which encodes an active LRS. Introduction of this gene to pathogenic A. tumefaciens imparted antibiotic resistance, suggesting that the biocontrol organism carries a self-protected ARS to avoid cell death [155]. Thus, although ARSs are good drug targets due to their high selectivity and potency toward microbes, sharing of ARS resistance genes not only locally, among neighboring bacteria, but also across long distances by selective pressure is a major obstacle for ARS drug application [148]. Identification of ARS inhibitors that are not associated with self-immunity and that do not transfer natural resistance genes should be identified. Finally, based on the different chemical properties of the 20 ARSs, targeting multiple ARSs simultaneously may be a safe way to overcome the emergence of resistance.",

Therapeutic applications of ARS-targeted inhibitors will offer the alternative drugs to overcome the inevitable bacterial resistance to currently used antibiotics. Although there are no known antiviral drugs targeting ARSs, identification of a GAIT-like RNA motif in the viral genome [68] or discovery of host ARS-RNA intermediates that are packaged into retroviruses may offer a new opportunities for the development of antiviral agents [148].",
