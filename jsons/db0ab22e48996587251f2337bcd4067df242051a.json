Methods for the analysis of information on incubation times are investigated with a particular focus on inference regarding a possible maximum incubation time, after which an exposed individual would be known to be disease free. Data from the Hong Kong SARS epidemic are used for illustration. The incorporation of interval-censored data is considered and comparison is made with percentile estimation. Results suggest that a wide class of models for incubation times should be considered because the apparent informativeness of a likelihood depends on the choice and generalizability of a model. There will usually remain a probability of releasing from quarantine some infected individuals and the impact of early release will depend on the size of the epidemic.",

The variables examined were age, sex, health care worker status, vital status on hospital discharge and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, where higher values of LDH re ect more severe disease. It can be seen that while the cases are similar in age, sex and worker status, there is a higher death rate and some evidence of more severe disease in the cases with the longer possible infection intervals. This may re ect the fact that more severe cases arriving at a hospital might well have had a longer period with the disease and be less able to characterize precisely their possible time of infection. The impact of extending the allowed interval size is examined later. There remains, of course, the implicit assumption that the cases with some information on infection time are a random sample of the entire distribution of cases. However, the possibility of biases in reporting, heterogeneity in routes of transmission or varying infectious doses of the SARS coronavirus remains.",

Figure 1 allows the comparison of the apparent information in the data set under the di erent modelling assumptions. For the truncated gamma model, the pro\u00ffle likelihood never drops below 60 per cent suggesting that any value of M greater than the maximum time observed, 14, is plausible. Thus it appears that the data is uninformative with respect to the maximum incubation time if a gamma distribution is assumed. However, the situation is di erent for the truncated lognormal model. While the MLE for M is again 14 days for this model, any value for M greater than 19.5 days makes the data more than 10 times less plausible than does the MLE of 14 days. For public health purposes, it could therefore be argued that, based only on such data and an assumed log-normal model, that a quarantine time of 20 days might be necessary to ensure that SARS cases were not released 'too early'. Recall that the focus here is on the upper limit of an interval of plausible values rather than any speci\u00ffc estimator for the maximum incubation time. A possible reason for the widely di erent behaviour of the pro\u00ffle likelihood for the two models is a di erence in model \u00fft. If we consider the more general log-gamma model that includes both of the other models as special cases, the pro\u00ffle likelihood for M is more informative than that based on a gamma model, but it never falls below a value of 20 per cent. Thus the apparent ability to rule out larger values of M under the log-normal model is not present if a less restrictive model assumption is made. This is true even though the maximum likelihood estimate of q is \u22120:13, a value close to the value q = 0 corresponding to the log-normal model. The hypothesis of a truncated gamma distribution would not be supported within this class of models. The maximum likelihood estimates of the various models are given in Figure 2 along with a histogram of the data. The estimated log-normal and log-gamma distributions are quite similar while the truncated gamma does not appear to \u00fft the data very well. All the models fail to some extent in re ecting the preponderance of short incubation times.",

As outlined earlier, it is convenient mathematically to make all observations interval-censored. Observations with a single day of presumed exposure are given an interval of width 1 day in our analysis but, in principle, a much narrower interval could be used if the precision could be justi\u00ffed. A brief exploration suggests that this would have little impact on the likelihood. Figure 4 presents pro\u00ffle likelihoods for M based on the gamma, log-normal and log-gamma models of Section 2. These plots are based on calculations of the likelihoods for values of M at intervals of 0.25 and beginning at min(t Li ) + 0:5 = 13. For convenience, the MLE of M has been taken to be the value among these which gives the largest likelihood. Further precision could be achieved but is not likely to be important. It can be seen that while the general pattern of the likelihoods is similar to that in Figure 1 , with interval-censoring not even the log-normal likelihood drops to less than the 10 per cent level.

Because of its exibility in the tails, the log-gamma can also be recommended for percentile estimation. Investigation of other methods is warranted. Possibilities would include the use of sample quantiles to de\u00ffne non-parametric con\u00ffdence intervals for population quantiles [10, Chapter XI, Section 3.1] or the asymptotic distribution of sample quantiles [4, Appendix A.2.3] . Whatever method is adopted, the uncertainty involved in any estimation of percentiles should be incorporated into public health decisions.",

It appears based on the data presented here that a quarantine time of 10 days for SARS might release one infectious patient in twenty. Therefore, for a quarantined population of 200, this would correspond to 10 individuals but the larger the quarantined population, the larger the number of released infectious individuals. Thus the length of a quarantine period might well be set in light of the expected number of quarantined individuals. Also consideration of the psychological and economic impact of quarantine on individuals and the population as a whole must be balanced against the risks associated with early release of infected individuals.",
