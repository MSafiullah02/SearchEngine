The icosahedron is the optimum solution to the problem of constructing, from repeating subunits, a strong structure to enclose a maximum volume.

One kind is the glycoprotein peplomer (peplos = envelope) or spike. These peplomers can often be seen clearly in electron micrographs as projections from the outer surface of the envelope (Plate 1-1B). The other kind of envelope protein, matrix protein, is nonglycosylated and is found on the inside of the envelope of virions of several families; it provides added rigidity. The envelope of rhabdoviruses is closely applied to a bullet-shaped matrix protein that encloses a helical nucleocapsid. Arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and coronaviruses have no matrix protein and consequently are rather more pleomorphic than other enveloped viruses.",

The two strands of poxvirus DNA are covalently cross-linked at each end, so that on denaturation, the molecule becomes a large single-stranded circle (Fig. 1-3C\n). The linear dsDNA of some herpesviruses (and the linear ssRNA of retroviruses) contains repeat sequences at the ends of the molecule. Following partial digestion of both DNA strands from their 5\u2019 ends by an exonuclease, the exposed single-stranded ends are complementary in their nucleotide sequences, thus providing \u201ccohesive\u201d or \u201csticky\u201d ends, so that, if the molecule is melted, it will reanneal as a circular dsDNA. In the case of the adenoviruses, these terminal repeats are inverted; hence, even without enzymatic digestion, denatured molecules self-anneal to form single-stranded circles (Fig. 1-3A). Inverted terminal repeat sequences, which give rise to \u201chairpin\u201d structures, are also a feature of the ssDNA parvoviruses (Fig. 1-3D).",

Furthermore, a given mRNA sequence may be read in two different reading frames (theoretically, up to three, because each codon is a triplet), giving rise to two (or three) proteins with different amino acid sequences. These fascinating examples of genetic economy are well illustrated by the papovaviruses (see Fig. 1-4) and will be discussed in Chapter 4.

Surface proteins are denatured within a few minutes at temperatures of 55\u00b0 to 60\u00b0C, with the result that the virion is no longer infectious, because it is no longer capable of normal cellular attachment and/or uncoating. At ambient temperature the rate of decay of infectivity is slower but significant, expecially in hot summer weather or in the tropics in any season. Viral preparations must therefore be stored at low temperature; 4\u00b0C (ice or a refrigerator) is usually satisfactory for a day or so, but longer term preservation requires temperatures well below zero. Two convenient temperatures are \u221270\u00b0C, the temperature of frozen CO2 (\u201cdry ice\u201d) and of some freezers, or \u2212196\u00b0C, the temperature of liquid nitrogen. As a rule of thumb, the half-life of most viruses can be measured in seconds at 60\u00b0C, minutes at 37\u00b0C, hours at 20\u00b0C, days at 4\u00b0C, and years at \u221270\u00b0C or lower. The enveloped viruses are more heat labile than nonenveloped viruses. Some enveloped viruses, notably respiratory syncytial virus, tend to be inactivated by the process of freezing and subsequent thawing, probably as a result of disruption of the virion by ice crystals. This poses problems in the collection and transportation of clinical specimens. The most practical way of avoiding such problems is to deliver specimens to the laboratory as rapidly as practicable, packed without freezing, on ice (see Chapter 13).",

The penton base is a pentamer of polypeptide III; the fiber is a trimer of polypeptide IV. Several other viral polypeptides occur just beneath the capsid (VI, VIII, IX) and others again in the core (V, VII, 55K), where they are intimately associated with the viral DNA. (C) The structure of helical nucleocapsids has been elucidated by studies of a nonenveloped plant virus, tobacco mosaic virus, but the principles apply to animal viruses with helical nucleocapsids, all of which are enveloped. In tobacco mosaic virus a single polypeptide is folded to form a capsomer. A total of 2130 capsomers assemble in a helix with a pitch of 2.3 nm and an axial repeat of 6.9 nm (49 subunits in each three turns). The 6-kb RNA genome sits in a groove on the inner part of the capsomer, and is wound to form an RNA helix of the same pitch, 8 nm in diameter, which extends the length of the virion. The virion is 300 nm long and 18 nm in diameter, with a hollow cylindrical core 4 nm in diameter. (D) All animal viruses with a helical nucleocapsid and some of those with an icosahedral capsid are enveloped. The envelope consists of a virus-specified matrix protein (M; absent in Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Coronaviridae, as well as in the enveloped viruses with icosahedral capsids), beneath a lipid bilayer in which are inserted numerous glycoprotein peplomers.
