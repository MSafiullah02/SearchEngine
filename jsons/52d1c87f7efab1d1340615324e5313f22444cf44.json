            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV ) infection can have a pronounced impact on several investigation areas. Reports on natural MHV outbreaks are rare and most studies have been conducted by deliberately infecting mice with MHV laboratory strains that cause moderate to severe disturbances to the immune system. We have investigated the effects of a natural acute outbreak of MHV in our otherwise specific-pathogen-free (SPF ) inbred mouse colonies, and of enzootic chronic MHV infection on cytokine production and resistance to the intracellular pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi. We found that BALB/c and/or C57BL/6 SPF mice that had been injected with T. cruzi blood trypomastigotes from recently MHV-contaminated (MHV+) mice developed significantly higher parasite blood counts, accelerated death, and showed higher IL-10 production by spleen cells than their counterparts whose T. cruzi inoculum was derived from MHV-negative (MHV\u2212) donors. Interferon-c (IFN-c) production by MHV+ and MHV\u2212 mice was not significantly different. In contrast, T. cruzi infection of chronically MHV-infected mice did not result in major changes in the course of infection when compared with that observed in mice from MHV\u2212 colonies, although a trend to higher parasitaemia levels was observed in BALB/c MHV+ mice. Nevertheless, both BALB/c and C57BL/6 T. cruzi-infected MHV+ mice had diminished IFN-c production to parasite-antigen stimulation in comparison with similarly infected MHV\u2212 mice. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production levels by spleen cells did not differ between chronic MHV+ and MHV\u2212 mice, but IFN-c neutralization by monoclonal antibody treatment of anti-CD3-stimulated spleen cell cultures showed higher levels of IL-10 synthesis in MHV+ BALB/c mice.",

Most reports deal with virulent laboratory Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV ) collectively designates corona strains, although more recently, attenuated MHV laboratory viruses of a wide range of virulence.

Nevertheless, although tolerated exposure, in our otherwise specific-pathogen-free (SPF ) inbred by many researchers, evidence has accumulated over the years mouse colonies, and of enzootic chronic MHV infection on that results from several investigation areas can be comprocytokine production and resistance to the intracellular pathomised by concomitant MHV infections.

In later experiments, designated 'chronic' MHV We found that BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice that had been injected with blood trypomastigotes from recently MHV-infection, the T. cruzi strain was started anew from tissueculture-grown trypomastigotes and maintained in MHV\u2212 contaminated mice became much more susceptible to T. cruzi infection and produced higher IL-10 levels than their counter-mice, whose blood was used as a source of T. cruzi to infect recipients derived from MHV+ colonies that had been infected parts whose T. cruzi inoculum was derived from MHVnegative (MHV\u2212) donors.
