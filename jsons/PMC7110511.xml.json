            "text": "For centuries influenza has affected human health both seasonally and with recurring pandemics. Despite significant reduction of disease burden through vaccination efforts, circulation of seasonal influenza A and B viruses cause excess morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with preexisting pulmonary conditions. It is reported that the seasonal flu is responsible for over 36,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations at a cost of $10 billion each year in the United States [1], [2]. Two subtypes of influenza A virus H3N2 and H1N1 have circulated within the human population. Influenza A viruses have a broad host range and thus differ from influenza B that has a limited host range infecting only humans and seals. In these hosts, influenza B viruses can cause significant disease and are a predominant circulating strain of influenza virus in approximately one in every 3 cases [3]. Both influenza A and B viruses present with two types of surface proteins \u2013 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and Matrix protein (M2/BM2), which is a proton-selective ion channel protein integral in the viral envelope. Influenza B viruses harbor some interesting genetic differences from influenza A including some additional encoded proteins and may have different characteristics of M2 protein. Specifically, BM2 is translated by a stop/start translation mechanism, which is different from influenza A viruses in which M2 is translated from a spliced transcript [4].",

Recently, the world experienced a global life-threatening phase 6 pandemic caused by a novel swine origin H1N1 virus. During past pandemics, influenza viruses needed more than 6 months to spread allowing sufficient time to develop new vaccines. As experienced, this new H1N1 virus spread worldwide in less than 6 weeks [5]. Had the virulence been higher, the mortality rate prior to the availability of the vaccine would have been catastrophic. The rapid spread of the viral infection recently experienced is of grave concern as the development window to manufacture an effective vaccine may not be sufficient in order to provide wide-spread global immunization. Thus, viral infection control methods are mainly dependent on antiviral agents.",

They are not effective against influenza B and the development of wide spread amantadine resistance in H3N2 (99%) and H1N1 (10%) strains during 2008\u20132009 season has limited their utility [2]. Fortunately, this recent pandemic swine origin H1N1 virus and some other influenza A and B viruses are still susceptible to the two NA inhibiting drugs, zanamivir (inhaled) and oseltamivir (oral) [2], [6]. Zanamavir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are licensed worldwide for treatment and prevention of influenza. Oseltamivir-resistant viruses have recently increased in circulation, especially among the H1N1 virus [7]. New antivirals have been developed in the last few years but given the rapidly evolving nature of antiviral resistance, other options warrant exploration.",

Free NO or NO derived from donating compounds have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial activity during in vitro and in vivo animal studies [10], [11], [12], [13]. The literature supports that NO or its derivatives have inhibitory effects on a variety of viral infections [14]. This inhibitory effect was shown to be marked in IFN--mediated inhibition manifested by activated macrophages [15]. It was also shown to be correlated with s-nitrosylation of viral proteins such as reductases and proteases [reviewed in 16]. Conversely, it appears that despite the seemingly beneficial role of NO in viral infections, the over production of NO in response to viral insult may lead to detrimental effects in the host, particularly in influenza infections [17].",

In brief, the device consisted of two cylindrical Plexiglas\u00ae exposure chambers with separate gas entry ports and a common exit port. These chambers were surrounded by an airtight Plexiglas\u00ae jacket to create a thermally isolated environment. This jacket enclosed an electrical heater unit controlled by an internal thermostat (Invensys Appliances Control, Carol Stream, Illinois, USA), that provided stable temperatures inside the chamber. Independent lines from each of the two exposure chambers provided samples of the gas mixtures to a NO/NO2/O2 electrochemical analyzer (AeroNOx, Pulmonox Medical Inc, Tofield, AB, Canada) to detect the exact composition of the gases in the mixture. Gases were supplied from pressurized cylinders at a constant pressure of 50 pounds per square inch. These included 10,000 parts per million (ppm) NO diluted in N2 (Airgas, Chicago, USA), and medical air (Praxair, Mississauga, ON, Canada). These gases were then mixed together at pre-determined concentrations using a dilution manifold and a digital mass flow meter (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA). Gas mixtures of 80 or 160 ppm, were delivered to the exposure chamber at a rate of 10.0 L/min at 70\u201390% relative humidity at temperatures of approximately 28\u201337 \u00b0C (appropriate for each experiment), through two independent humidifiers (MR850, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, CA, USA). Control chamber contained only air flow at 10 L/min.",

They were able to demonstrate that NO released from SNAP inhibits the influenza A virus at an early stage of viral replication which correlated with viral RNA synthesis. Studies, using Coxsackie virus, have demonstrated that NO interrupted the viral life cycle and that this may be due to NO-mediated S-nitrosylation of the cysteine residue inhibiting protease activity in the protease 3C [19], [20]. Harris et al. demonstrated that several processes in the late stages of viral replication, including viral DNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virion maturation, were greatly inhibited by IFN--induced NO in vaccinia virus [30]. Other in vitro studies utilizing chemical donors of NO have shown inhibition of viral replication in DNA and RNA viruses. It was suggested that NO inhibits viral proteins, RNA synthesis and viral replication by modifying molecules such as reductases and proteases required for replication [2], [18], [20], [21], [31]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct virucidal activity of gNO on cell free virions is reported. There may be targets on the virion, such as HA and NA, to which NO could bind and disrupt the infection process. However, little is known about the antiviral mechanism by which NO acts. One of the plausible mechanisms of antimicrobial activity of NO involves the interaction of this free radical (and a reactive nitrogen intermediate) with reactive oxygen intermediates, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2-) to form a variety of antimicrobial molecular species [32]. Colasanti et al. theorized that nitric oxide may be able to affect surface proteins, by nitrosylation of the cysteine moieties within its structure [16]. This could alter the stoichiometry interaction with sialic acid or prevent the fusion of the virion with the epithelial cell membrane [33]. Results from this study seem to support the notion.",

            "text": "The influenza viruses\u2019 surface glycoproteins, HA and NA, are the antigens that define the particular strain of influenza. The variation of these molecules over time permits the virus to evade human immune responses and therefore necessitates the formulation of a new vaccine each year. The HA is a sialic acid receptor-binding molecule and mediates entry of the virus into target cells. Whereas, the NA cleaves the cellular-receptor sialic acid residues to which the newly formed particles are attached. This cleavage releases the viruses, which can then invade new cells. Like other NA inhibitors, without functional NA, infection could be limited to one round of replication, rarely enough to cause disease. Preliminary results, shown here for the first time, demonstrate that when testing on a whole virion, NA activity is inhibited by gNO. Thus, NA inhibition may be one possible mechanism of viral inhibition by NO. We are currently screening a wide variety of viruses to gNO to assess which are more or less susceptible to gNO. Concurrently, we are also evaluating NA and HA inhibition in these viruses. Together, this hopefully will shed further light on the antiviral mechanism caused by gNO.",

            "text": "We demonstrate here that there is a correlation between the length of time the saline, (media which suspends the virions) is exposed to gNO and antiviral effectiveness. Regardless of the gNO concentration (80 or 160 ppm) the antiviral effect coincided with a specific range of nitrite concentration and acidic pH that were dependent on the exposure time. This can be explained by the fact that, over time, gNO diffuses into the saline and results in increasing the nitrite concentration. These ions react with protons in the water and produce HNO2 resulting in a drop in pH. This resulting pH level along with the nitrite concentration is within the same range as was found to be antifungal and antibacterial in other studies using a combination of acid and nitrite (acidified nitrite) producing NO gas [34], [35], [36]. Although low pH levels on their own, can have an antiviral effect, we show here that by eliminating the acidified liquid milieu we still achieve a reduced cellular infectivity of H1N1. The gNO treatment in this case showed reduced infectivity (by 85%) and thus provides further evidence that there are targets on the virion that NO may bind with and prevent cellular infectivity. This notion was further supported by the results from the NA assay. Moreover, We have shown here that when adding virus into either 10 mM nitrite at a neutral pH or to saline with a reduced pH (4.5), for 1 h, no effect on virus viability was found. This confirms our conclusions, which support the thought that the NO is the antiviral compound in this reaction.",

This effect is dose dependent and begins to occur at the highest range of dosages applied in the approved use of inhaled NO for full term infants (80 ppm). At a dose of 160 ppm a significant virucidal and an antiviral effect during early infection of influenza A was observed. However influenza B was not similarly affected during infection but was susceptible in a cell free environment. We propose here a mechanism of action for the viral inhibition, in which influenza NA is being inactivated by gNO. Future research should focus on expanding these experimental observations to test the antiviral effect of gNO and surface protein (HA and NA) inhibition on a wide variety of viruses in order to help elucidate the mechanism of its antiviral action.",
