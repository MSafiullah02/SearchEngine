            "text": "Veterinary practitioners provide constant advice and recommendations to beef cow-calf operations across the United States and Canada regarding health, well-being, and production practices to gain satisfactory health status and optimum herd performance. Summarizing and reporting these recommendations provides valuable feedback to understand how best management practices are applied at the beef cow-calf herd level. These recommendations, over time, have been developed by academic researchers, practicing veterinarians, consulting veterinarians, and other animal health professionals. Currently, there are several published resources in the literature that provide recommendations made to feedlot managers by consulting veterinarians regarding animal health and well-being (Terrell et al., 2011; Terrell et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015). In addition, similar publications exist for recommendations made by consulting nutritionists for nutritional recommendations in feedlot operations (Galyean, 1996; Galyean and Gleghorn, 2001; Vasconcelos and Galyean, 2007; Samuelson et al., 2016). Although there is limited and outdated published data (Sanderson et al., 2000) that provide a description of health and production practices employed by cow-calf producers, there is no published data that describe recommendations made by veterinary practitioners to cow-calf operations. Thus, the objective of this survey was to obtain descriptive data to describe recommended practices made by veterinary practitioners who service clients with commercial beef cow-calf operations in the United States and Canada in terms of vaccine protocols, health practices, and production practices.",

According to the USDA (2010), during 2007 only 68.9% of cow-calf operations vaccinated cattle. However, the 2016 CattleFax Cow-Calf Survey reported that 93% of surveyed operations in the United States have in place a vaccination plan for cattle, and Waldner et al.

Survey results are also in agreement with recommendations made by Comerford et al. (2013), whom suggested that any health program should include vaccination for IBR, PI-3, BRSV, BVD, Haemophilus somnus, leptospirosis, and clostridial diseases. Similarly, Waldner et al. (2013) reported that the most commonly used vaccines by Canadian cow-calf producers to vaccinate calves were clostridial (84.6%) and BVD and IBR (55.6%). Furthermore, Woolums et al. (2014) reported that 87% of respondents to a survey of veterinarians that deal with nursing beef calf respiratory disease recommend a routine administration of respiratory vaccines to beef calves. However, USDA (2010) reported that during 2007, 60.6% of beef cow-calf operations did not vaccinate calves for respiratory disease from birth until the time they were sold and over 30% of all calves were on these operations. It is very probable that these recommendations are made with the aim to prevent BRD, which is the most common cause of death for all production classes of cattle and calves in the United States (Woolums et al., 2013) and costs the beef industry millions of dollars every year on prevention, control, and death loss (Macartney et al., 2003). Radostits et al. (1994) and Woolums et al. (2014) reported that viruses isolated from calves affected with BRD included IBR, BRSV, BVD, and PI-3; bacterial pathogens also isolated included M. haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, H. somnus, Mycoplasma bovis, and Mycoplasma dispar. Furthermore, in a survey of biosecurity practices of United States beef cow-calf producers, Sanderson et al. (2000) reported that 18% of producers vaccinated cattle against IBR, 17% vaccinated against BVD, 28% against leptospirosis, 20% against campylobacteriosis, 42% against brucellosis (for heifers), and only 1.1% vaccinated cattle against tritrichomonosis. The observed pattern of vaccination recommended by veterinarians and performed by beef cow-calf producers across the United States is most probably due to the fact that vaccines for BRSV, BVD, PI-3, and IBR are commercially offered in a single injection vaccine.",

When their clients were keeping calves past weaning for backgrounding or grazing before selling, 68% of veterinarians did not recommend to administer additional booster vaccines. Similarly, Woolums et al. (2013) reported that almost 40% of cow-calf operations that had previously vaccinated calves against BRD pathogens administered booster vaccines to calves before weaning. When banding is recommended as a castration method, regardless of the time point at which castration was performed, 97% of veterinarians also recommended that calves receive a tetanus vaccine (Table 6). This is in agreement with survey data reported by Coetzee et al. (2010), where over 50% of responding veterinarians routinely used a tetanus toxoid injection at the time of castration. Similarly, in a research trial comparing different castration methods on growth performance of beef bulls, Rust et al.

Similar results are reported from this survey, where 93% of participating veterinarians recommended deworming the female herd as a regular practice. From these veterinarians who recommended deworming the female herd, 96% recommended to do it 1 to 2 times per yr. Over 80% of cow-calf operations in the United States followed this recommendation, with 5.1% of operations deworming cows less than once a yr, 38.2% of operations de-worming cows at least once a yr, and 43.5% deworming the cow herd more than once a yr (USDA, 2010). Furthermore, over 50% of veterinarians highly recommend the use of both injectable and pour on products for deworming of the female herd. Although the USDA reports that over 50% of cow-calf operations deworm calves once or more than once per year, almost 40% of them do not ever deworm calves (USDA, 2010). Deworming of calves was the second most common practice recommended by 64% of veterinarians at branding time, with injectable dewormers being the most recommended type by 84% of participating veterinarians for this period. The most common practice recommended by veterinarians before and after weaning was deworming of calves (76 and 81%, respectively); an injectable dewormer mas the most recommended type of dewormer, recommended by 74% of veterinarians before weaning, whereas a pour-on was the most recommended (65%) type of dewormer after weaning (Table 7).",

            "text": "Castration of bull calves intended for beef production is a commonly performed management practice in livestock operations in the United States, accounting for approximately 16 million procedures per yr (USDA, 2015). Bull calves are routinely castrated at livestock operations to decrease secondary sex characteristics, minimize aggressive behavior, facilitate management, and improve beef quality (Faulkner et al., 1992; Rust et al., 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2010). At least 77% of all bull calves were castrated on almost 60% of all cow-calf operations in the United States during 2007 (USDA, 2008a). The majority of participating veterinarians (34%) recommended castrating bull calves at an age of 0 to 7 d, whereas 18% of veterinarians recommended to castrate at 2 to 3 mo of age, and 16% of veterinarians recommended castrating bull calves at branding (Table 9). These recommendations are in agreement with Bretschneider (2005), who reported that, based on observations of stress response, the younger the calf when castrated, the less stressful the procedure. This is regardless of the method used, recommending that castration occur at or shortly after birth. In contrast, data from the USDA (2008a) reports that cow-calf operations in the United States castrated calves at an average age of 77 d. However, most operations (74.5%) castrated bull calves at an age of <93 d, but almost 20% of operations did not castrate calves until they were over 122 d old. Several methods of castration exist (Bretschneider, 2005; Coetzee et al., 2010), each one having positive and negative attributes, but regardless of the preferred method of castration, cattle will undergo pain and stress during this procedure (Rust et al., 2007). The 2 most commonly used methods for castrating bull calves are either the surgical procedure or the rubber banding method (AVMA, 2014). Respondents were asked to rank castration methods from most to least preferred. Knife cut was selected as the preferred castration method at branding by 86% of veterinarians (n = 132), banding was selected as the preferred method by 11% of veterinarians (n = 114), burdizzo by 1% of veterinarians (n = 73), and no castration of bull calves at branding was the preferred recommendation of 27% of veterinarians (n = 22) (Table 9). At weaning, knife cut was the preferred castration method recommended by 67% of veterinarians (n = 123), banding was the second-most preferred castration method for 25% of veterinarians (n = 106), burdizzo was the next most preferred castration method for 15% of veterinarians (n = 65), and no castration of bull calves at weaning was the preferred recommendation of 61% of veterinarians (n = 36) (Table 9). In agreement with results from this survey, the USDA (2008a) reported that 49.2% of cow-calf operations in the United States used a surgical method when castrating calves, 47.3% preferred to use banding, and only 3.5% of operations preferred to use the burdizzo technique to castrate calves. Furthermore, Coetzee et al. (2010) reported that the most frequently used method of castration by the majority (57%) of veterinarians was the surgical procedure, followed by the banding procedure, which was used by 44% of veterinarians.",
