A new school needs to be built; upon completion it requires staff and maintenance: these are entirely different things that can be managed well on a project basis. But a proper policy would take a longer term perspective that includes not just the building and maintenance of the infrastructure. Such a policy would set parameters to how infrastructure relates to continued access, how both of these relate to the delivery of a curriculum, and how to undertake regular reviews of accomplishments.",

Interestingly, although this term (alternated with \u2018projectitis\u2019) has become an integral part of the vernacular of the\u2014critical\u2014government bureaucrat, we have been unable to ascertain an authoritative definition for it. In development studies, Pareschi (2002) and Little (2005) refer to projectism when they describe the tendency of the international development community (the \u2018do-gooders\u2019 (Christensen 2004) in development aid) to impose a project format with defined beginning and end, contained resources (money, people) in time and space, on daily activities undertaken by indigenous communities that by their very nature are organic and ongoing, e.g. the defence of territory, production of food, and political organization. Such project \u2018containment\u2019, they assert, can provoke major changes in cultural values, leadership patterns, time conceptions, organizational structure, and political relations in affected indigenous communities. True as this may be, the popularity of projectism/itis suggests that the phenomenon may have detrimental effects in high-income, industrialized nations as well. A definition that reaches beyond indigenous culture into (Western) bureaucratic and political values might read \u2018The reflex, intention and action to contain organisational and community efforts in terms of resource allocation, time, space and conceptualisation purely for the sake of accountability and management purposes, not because the effort at hand necessarily lends itself to such limitation\u2019.",

Policy diffusion researchers (e.g. Shipan and Volden 2008) argue that local governments drive policy innovation and diffusion of novel policies horizontally to other local governments, and vertically to regional and national governments. For example, policy diffusion facilitated the Netherlands\u2019 efforts to develop a broad Healthy Public Policy in the 1980s (de Leeuw and Polman 1995). Global commitments, such as the Kyoto Protocol for climate change adaptation and mitigation or the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, can be seen as crucial benchmarks for the need to develop new policy types. Policy innovation does not happen exclusively bottom-up or top-down, but must be characterized as happening through a process called \u2018mixed scanning\u2019 (Etzioni 1967, 1986) in which systems of incremental and reciprocal checks and balances between governance levels create opportunities for change.",

This glocalization dynamic is reciprocal. Less likely or desirable global developments may be mitigated\u2014or exacerbated\u2014by local action. For instance, the increasing number of local governments around the world adopting \u2018zero-carbon emission\u2019 policies (e.g. Koehn 2008) not only contribute to possible reductions in climate change risks, but also send signals to their colleagues, at local as well as higher government levels, that such actions are feasible and effective. Through policy diffusion these local policies impact on global change. In fact, analyses of local government efficacies in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to the introduction of the terms \u2018glocal\u2019 and \u2018glocalization\u2019 into our vocabularies (Swyngedouw 1992). Virtually every development and phenomenon in Healthy Cities has glocal dimensions.",

The growing body of evidence, over recent decades, on the social, political, and commercial determinants of health may well enable local government better than other levels of government and governance to take decisive action. Evidence from the other chapters in this book shows that local governments (and especially Healthy City ones) are in closer contact with their constituents and would purportedly be able to respond more effectively and quickly to needs expressed. Clearly this is an ideal-type description: not all local governments are transparent and accountable, and not all people may be, or may feel, represented. This is particularly true for slum dwellers. Sometimes urban inequities are literally hidden\u2014in many Third World cities the slums and their informal populations are located in gullies and ravines. But in others, the favelas rise up high on the slopes surrounding affluence. It appears that technology can come to a degree of rescue, whether it is enabling social connectedness in Nairobi slums (Corburn and Karanja 2014) or physical connectedness through novel public transportation solutions in Medellin, Colombia (D\u00edez et al. 2015).",

One was a horizontal (comprehensive, systems-driven) approach aligned with a set of strong values around equity, participation, and community-driven bottom-up action for health and well-being, and the other a vertical (disease and health care-driven) approach aligned with the need to address specific (burdens of) disease in many countries, and grounded in existing institutions and patterns in the delivery of clinical interventions. Ideology-inspired debates have raged, contrasting the superiority of each approach. Reviews show that vertical programmes, particularly those targeting infectious disease morbidity, may yield short-term and specific health gains (e.g. from vaccination campaigns), but that long-term population health development (e.g. aiming at the reduction of the incidence of non-communicable disease [NCD]) does not unequivocally benefit from such selective approaches (e.g. Magnussen et al. 2004). Vertical programmes work for particular threats, and horizontal programmes contribute to general well-being. In particular, addressing health equity and NCDs does not align well with a selective, vertical approach. Evidence has emerged that, depending on the existing health profile and management of (social) determinants of health in different communities and countries, an appropriate balance between the two should be struck. Building on a mix between vertical and horizontal primary health care, the aspiration should be to engage in the development of comprehensive health strategies accessible to all (Rasanathan et al. 2011).",

As such, a health asset can be defined as any factor or resource which enhances the ability of individuals, groups, communities, populations, social systems, or institutions to maintain and sustain health and well-being and to help to reduce health inequities. These assets can operate at the level of the individual, group, community, or population as protective (or promoting) factors to buffer against life\u2019s stresses. Obviously a balance needs to be struck between the intangible assets (skills, knowledge, intents, and aspirations) and the hardware assets of a community (schools, work, infrastructure, etc.). Even when both are available there may still be a disconnect between the two: individuals, families, and communities may want to improve their health, but insidious factors such as (health) literacy, culture, sexism, and racism may stand in the way of full and equitable access and use.

(In)equality, some say, is purely a description of that social health gradient, whereas (in)equity conveys a view of the moral and social injustice of such differences in society. Wilkinson and Pickett (2010) describe how equitable societies provide and create better opportunities for health for all, including enhanced economic development, sustainability, and educational attainment. Striving for equity is not necessarily a requirement or prerogative of national government alone\u2014it depends and thrives on a vibrant civil society and its political representation, extending from local action to global policy and the other way around.",

There are no specific requirements to the design or architecture of such ISCs, as they are often driven by unique local contexts and requirements. Whether cities lived up to the expectation beyond their formal application commitments was ascertained via annual reporting templates. Virtually all members of the network reported that they did establish an ISC, although the frequency with which this body met was variable. In some cities it met only once a year, and in others more regularly, up to monthly. In cities where the ISC met annually, the role of the body was more at a systems and regulatory level, such as driving and approving policy development and monitoring of intersectoral deliverables; ISCs that met more regularly tended to engage more directly in the operational aspects of partnership development, such as allocation of resources and direct supervision of working relationships.",

The establishment and implementation of one Health in All Policy in one place cannot be considered the end point. It is a stage in an evolutionary practice: the policy needs to be reviewed, adapted, and renewed to meet the exigencies that it has created. The context, and local stakeholders, in which this happens will constantly change. Political shifts may require a renewal of executive commitment; evolving community concerns will dictate ongoing participatory consultative action; and technological advances may inspire new solutions.",

We have described how such vision has been given momentum by developments both local and global, firmly grounded in a set of coherent values including equity, participation, sustainability, and accountability. It is not just preferable to work towards policy for health: it is the only thing to do to respond to the needs of communities, and through integrated connections between sectors, in Health in All Policies.",
