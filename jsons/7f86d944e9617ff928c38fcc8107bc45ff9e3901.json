Recently, the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has affected nearly 200 countries worldwide. 2019-nCov can cause severe lung disease, multiple-organ damage, and significant mortalities. Liver transplant recipients, because of long-term oral immunosuppressant effects, may be more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection and have a worse prognosis than the general population. It is urgent to set up guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients. In this article, we reviewed the clinical aspects of 2019-nCoV infection, characteristics of liver transplant recipients, immunosuppressant usage, and potential drug interactions to provide recommendations to clinical staff managing liver transplant recipients during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

The initial attachment to the host cell is via binding of S protein to ACE2 receptor on host cell membrane [3] . 2019-nCoV is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. It can be inactivated by ether, 75% alcohol, 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, and chlorine-containing disinfectant, chloroform [1] . The main transmission routes are droplet transmission and mucosal contact transmission [4] . There is also the possibility of aerosol transmission after exposure to high concentrations of aerosol in a relatively closed environment for long period. 2019-nCoV nucleic acid sequences can be detected in patients' eye secretions and feces, but whether transmission can occur remains to be confirmed [4] . 2019-nCoV infects all age groups, particularly the elderly and those with underlying diseases [4] .
