Although the government has taken many steps to reduce drug prices, results are not optimal. Drug expenditures in hospitals increased rapidly even after implementation of price controls. The average annual per hospital drug expenditure in China's general hospitals tripled from \u00a514.1 million in 2002 to \u00a545.1 million in 20099 ($1.00=\u00a56.36).

            "text": "Following accession to the WTO in 2001, China revised its laws to incorporate obligations under Article 39.3 of the TRIPS. Article 39.3 requires WTO Members to protect the test and clinical trial data submitted by innovative companies against unfair commercial use. The Implementation Provisions of the Drug Administration Law and Regulations on Drug Registration of China provide 6-year data exclusivity for a drug containing a new chemical entity (NCE). Data exclusivity refers to protection of clinical test data that must be submitted to a regulatory agency to prove the safety and efficacy of a new drug, and prevents generic drug manufacturers from relying on these data in their own applications. This protection term is longer than that set out in TRIPS and in bilateral free trade agreements signed by the United States and other nations. Although protection of \u2018undisclosed data\u2019 against \u2018unfair commercial use\u2019 for 6 years is enshrined in China's law, there is a divergence of opinions between China and developed countries about certain key concepts such as \u2018new chemical entities\u2019 and \u2018unfair commercial use\u2019. In China, the definition of \u2018new drug\u2019 is broader than NCEs, and the Chinese government has agreed only to protect undisclosed data of class 1 new drugs, those not marketed in China and abroad. The United States and EU want higher standards of data exclusivity; to expand the interpretation of \u2018new chemical entities\u2019; and to redefine \u2018undisclosed data\u2019, so that the protection can cover class 3 new drugs (those that are marketed outside of China but not within). New estimates suggest that data exclusivity will increase China's health expenditure by 45.55 per cent on average per year from 2007 to 2009, while reducing the accessibility to 267 types of medicines by 27.14 per cent \u2013 a great negative impact on public health in China.26 Policy makers should further investigate the potential impact of data exclusivity on the public health and on access to medicines.",

For filing a registration application, drug administration authorities require the manufacturer to declare that the drug does not infringe any third-party patent. Amendments to China's Drug Registration Regulation in 2005 add that a patentee may, on the basis of an infringement judgment, request that the SFDA revoke an approved drug registration. Patent linkage in the United States has no post-registration revocation rules. For years the SFDA and Chinese courts have been in conflict over post-registration revocation. The intricacy of patent disputes and lack of legal basis for SFDA's revocation led to amendments to Drug Registration Regulation in 2007. These deleted a provision related to SFDA's revocation of registration of an approved drug on the basis of an infringement judgment. Since 2008, SFDA has been posting patent related information from applications, including generic applicants\u2019 assertions of non-infringement, on an accessible website. Such publication served as a notice, even though Chinese patent linkage regulation does not require the SFDA or the drug applicant to notify the patent holder of these guarantees.27 Although Chinese linkage regulations do not provide an automatic stay period, the threat of infringement litigation delays the entry of generic drugs.27 Pfizer's Viagra patent dispute strongly illustrates this: SFDA withheld approval of generics based on patent disputes. China's patent linkage system can neither reduce infringement litigation nor the risks of infringement. Increasing criticism focuses on patent linkage, that it has exceeded the scope of the SFDA's competence.28",

Article 69 of the new Patent Law (2008) provides for domestic and international exhaustion of patent rights and for parallel importation of the patented products without the patentee's consent, thereby ending the debate over the legitimacy of parallel importation. The new Patent Law does not clarify how exhaustion will apply to imported products sold outside of China under contractual restrictions. New issues will require judicial interpretation.
