The appropriateness of an indication for perioperative echocardiography has been reviewed in depth both for valvular and nonvalvular heart disease.8\n,\n9 If the examination is unlikely to provide clinical benefit, the current guidelines recommend that the echocardiography examination be withheld in the interests of safety.5, 6, 7 Furthermore, elective examinations should be postponed when possible. Clearly, emergency examinations with strong indications should proceed.5, 6, 7 Because the trajectory of this pandemic is so dynamic, the management and triage of echocardiography examinations will have to be flexible and responsive to local conditions at a given medical center, including patient-level and provider-level factors.5\n,\n6 This management and triage process should focus on the prevention of infection of patients and health care workers.10\n,\n11\n",
