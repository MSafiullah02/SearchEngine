This manuscript aims to optimize the ventilation strategy towards contaminant suppression in the isolation room. 3D Navier-Stokes and energy equation using finite volume method (FVM) with a domain of isolation room is solved for appropriate boundary conditions. The patient's body is approximated as a semi-cylindrical shape resting on a bed and is treated as a constant heat source. Velocity and temperature profile inside the isolation room for various configurations are simulated. Our results suggest that immune-suppressed patients should be kept near the air supply and infectious patients near the exhaust.",

            "text": "Medical facilities are places where relatively high levels of pathogenic (disease-causing) micro-organisms are generated and concentrated by an infected patient population or by procedures that handle infected human tissues and bodily fluids. These pathogens are spread by a number of contact and noncontact (airborne) causes. Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs, also referred to as nosocomial infections) have a significant impact on patient care. Mortality rates from HAIs are significant and affect the overall cost of healthcare delivery. It is agreed that 80-90% of HAIs are transmitted by direct contact, with 10-20% resulting from an airborne transmission (representing 0.4-1% of admitted patients) [4] . It is, therefore, imperative that we take a closer look at the design of healthcare facilities with respect to suppression of contaminants while at the same time providing patient comfort to ensure that the patient does not get worse after admission and leaves the facility healthy. For achieving this goal, the design of the heating, ventilation and cooling (herein referred to as HVAC) system of a healthcare facility is important and has to be economically viable. The term is often used interchangeably with the more common 'air conditioning'. The term air conditioning refers to a system that controls temperature, moisture in the air (humidity), supply of outside air for ventilation, filtration of airborne particles, and air movement in the occupied space. HVAC systems in healthcare facilities provide a broad range of services in support of populations who are uniquely vulnerable to an elevated risk of health, fire and safety hazard. The role of the HVAC system in life safety and infection control becomes more important with increasing complexity of the medical services provided and the acuity of illness of the patient population [5] .",

            "text": "Isolation refers to the separation of a seriously ill patient to stop the spread of infection or protect the patient from irritating factors. A patient known or suspected to harbour transmissible micro-organisms should be placed in a single room. A single room with appropriate air handling and ventilation is particularly important for reducing the risk of airborne transmission of micro-organisms from a source patient to susceptible patients and other persons in hospitals. Airborne transmission is just one of the means by which nosocomial infection spreads. Other modes of infection include contact, droplet, common vehicle and vector-borne. An isolation room is designed and provided with all the facilities that are required to ensure protection from all the above-mentioned modes of transmission of infectious microbes. Standard isolation rooms have a pan sanitizer near the room, a staff hand-wash basin within the room, an en suite bathroom, a self-closing door, a label as a standard isolation room. The most predominant mode of infection communication, i.e. airborne transmission is taken care of by an appropriate HVAC system. Broadly speaking, there are two classes of isolation rooms: Class N-negative pressure room and Class P-positive pressure room [6] . Negative pressure rooms are for patients who are suffering from infectious or contagious diseases like TB and SARS. The aim of placing infected persons in negative pressure rooms is to reduce transmission of disease via the airborne route. Conroy et al. [7] came up with a list of features, which should exist in a negative pressure room to effectively isolate the patient. Positive pressure rooms are installed in certain facilities to isolate profoundly immune-compromised patients, such as those suffering from AIDS. A lot of research has hence been focussed towards the design of isolation wards with respect to ventilation strategy for contaminant suppression and patient comfort.",

As per healthcare guidelines [8, 9] , ventilation strategy in an isolation room should be such that there are no stagnant and under-ventilated areas where infectious particles might be accumulated. In addition, healthcare providers subjected to an uncomfortable environment may not function at peak performance levels [5] . A study [8] of isolated patients concluded that healthcare workers visited patients in contact isolation less often than they visited regular patients, which might compromise patient safety and healthcare quality. Keeping this in mind, a proper ventilation strategy must be devised which provides for infection control and mitigation, comfort of both patients and healthcare providers, and efficient power consumption.",

            "text": "As such, there are many challenges to overcome in the design of an efficient HVAC system for contaminant suppression. The initial design problem of an isolation room is to fix a location of the supply and exhaust vents inside the isolation room. Cheong and Phua [10] proposed a ventilation strategy for effective removal of pollutant from hospital isolation wards and inferred that a low-lying exhaust together with a ceiling supply duct delivering laminar air was the best combination. The role of air changes per hour (ACH) in order to reduce the effective residence time of contaminant was also of prime research interest. Memarzadeh and Xu [11] investigated the role of air changes per hour in possible transmission of airborne infections by simulating various ventilation system configurations and concluded that the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust, and not the airflow ventilation rate as was expected. This observation was also corroborated experimentally by Mousavi and Grosskopf [12] and Walker et al. [13] . More in-depth studies on the path of a contaminant inside an isolation ward and its response to various strategies have been carried out. Tung et al. [14] carried out a study on contaminant (sulphur hexafluoride, SF6) dispersion inside isolation room by varying the room negative pressure (from \u22122.5 to \u221215.0 Pa), the ventilation rates (12 and 24 h \u22121 ), by factoring in the local air quality index, and the exposure index of hospital workers. Derakshan and Shaker [15] , in an attempt to reduce energy consumption by increasing the efficiency of natural ventilation, investigated volumetric flow rate in a building for various aspect ratios of the windows and their locations for various wind directions. Wan et al. [16] proposed a new method for selecting optimum indoor temperature and relative humidity to achieve minimum energy consumption for a required indoor thermal comfort level, which is evaluated with effective temperature. The research into contaminant suppression can be further extended to general hospital wards in order to reduce HAIs. Beggs et al. [17] conducted research into the need of ventilation system inside general multi-bed hospital wards.",

A three-dimensional k-e turbulence model using a finite difference code (UNIC), which was developed by Engineering Science Inc., USA, was adopted in this work. The numerical simulation was first adopted to predict the airflow patterns and ventilation performance and later, a laboratory experiment at room air and contaminant distribution in a full-scale test chamber was conducted to validate the simulation results. The results indicated that the location of inlet and outlet diffusers severely affected the ventilation efficiency. The arrangement of inlet/outlet diffusers can cause different flow recirculation patterns, and this may change the mean age of indoor contaminant, thus deciding how quickly the indoor contaminant can be removed. Yu et al. [19] conducted a study on ventilation strategies for hospitals to mitigate the risk of infections. They studied the effects of location of infected patients and air change per hour to minimize deposition and floating time of airborne virus particles while maximizing energy efficiency. Although there is a plethora of research [7-15, 17, 18, 20-23] on making contaminant removal systems efficient and optimizing power consumption in buildings, a comprehensive research that amalgamates effective ventilation systems with infection control in isolation wards of hospitals has a long way to go.",

It has dimensions of (L2 T-2). e, the turbulence eddy dissipation rate, is the rate at which the velocity fluctuations dissipate in a turbulent flow. It has dimensions of turbulent kinetic energy per unit time (L2 T-3). The kinetic energy is zero for laminar flow and can be as large as 5% of the kinetic energy of the mean flow in a highly turbulent case. The finite volume method (FVM) is adopted to solve the aforementioned Eqs. (1-8) . The details of this method were reported by authors elsewhere [24] . In this method, the physical domain is subdivided into a number of contiguous control volumes on an unstructured tetrahedral grid, as shown in Fig. 3 . Unstructured tetrahedral grids are constructed by dividing the computational domain into small cells that have a tetrahedral shape. The strength of this type of grid lies in its flexibility for handling very complex geometries. A commercial software package (ICEMCFD) was used to generate meshes. The generated mesh was made very fine near the patient body (0.01 m) and coarse towards the isolation room walls (0.2 m). A refined mesh was also generated at the air supply inlet and the exhaust. To effectively capture the air flow around the patient body, a mesh density box was generated with elements of size 0.025 m as can be seen from Fig. 3b. Equations (1-8) were discretized using FVM Techniques. Convective term is discretized using hybrid upwind scheme. The diffusion terms are discretized using second-order central difference. Weighted average of surrounding cell-centred properties is used for determining nodal quantities. SIMPLE like algorithm is used for handling pressure velocity decoupling. Collocated grid arrangement is applied, and movement interpolation is used to determine the face flux of each cells. System of algebraic equation is solved using BICGStab. Before analysing the flow pattern of aforementioned configuration of inlet and outlet of isolated room, the present numerical methodology is validated against data available in the literature [18] . Figure 4 shows the velocity at various location of room, and it has good agreement against the experiment.",

However, below the bed there is comparatively better airflow due to the recirculation of the air jet that hits the exhaust sidewall, as shown in Fig. 6 . Such a location of bed would be hazardous for an infectious patient because the stagnant air above the patient's bed would permit the bacteria to proliferate. However, this situation is favourable for the immune-suppressed patient since he needs to be protected from the supply air directly hitting his body. Such an airflow field serves as a defence shield for an immune-suppressed patient. As far as the rest of the room is concerned, it is under the sole effect of supply air having a temperature of 300 K. The air in the vicinity of the patient's body is slightly warmer than that in the rest of the space in room, as shown in Fig. 5c , d. Figure 7 shows the velocity and temperature contour in the x-y plane and the zy plane. The air supply inlet is lowered to 0.6096 m below the ceiling. The position of the bed of patient was near the air supply sidewall. Figure 8 shows the flow pattern in the x-y plane and the z-y plane for this case. It can be observed that the recirculation zones above and below the bed have decreased and stagnation zones have formed. This ventilation strategy as such is not recommended for an immune-suppressed patient because he might start complaining about draught sensation. Placing an infectious patient in the room is not recommended as well due to significant stagnation zones that exist inside the room. Another recirculation zone is formed above the jet, as can be seen from Fig. 8a , and this could possibly lead to a stagnation zone above the jet further deteriorating the ventilation of the room. These effects can be linked to the short-circuiting of the airflow due to reduced vent height. The temperature inside the room is more evenly distributed than in the previous case. Figure 9 shows the velocity and temperature contours in the x-y plane and zy plane of the third case. The air supply inlet is located 0.4572 m below the ceiling.

There is appreciable recirculation in both the upper and lower zones of the isolation room leading to better overall ventilation. This configuration is ideal for immune-suppressed patients as the patients would typically be in a region of stagnation as shown in Fig. 9b , which would protect them from any possible infections. The draught rating would also not be very high leading to optimal configuration for the immune-suppressed patient.

Although the space near the patient is agitated, there is a considerable fraction of the whole space that is experiencing stagnation in this strategy. Short-circuiting of flow would also be noticed in this case. Figure 14 shows the velocity and temperature contour in x-y and z-y plane for the fifth case. Multiple air supply inlets are located on the ceiling of the isolation room. The position of the bed of patient was near the exhaust sidewall. Figure 15 shows the flow pattern in the x-y and the y-z plane with the air supply mounted on the ceiling. Figure 15 shows the y-velocity profile as it develops across different levels in the z-x plane. An infectious patient is advised to be kept in an isolation room provided with a mixed-ventilation system. It has multiple laminar diffusers on the ceiling, and the patient's bed is strategically located with respect to the diffusers so that the bacteria concentration is diluted effectively. The upper zone between the two symmetrically located inlet vents shows some stagnation but in the occupied zone, the air is well mixed due to the presence of two supply openings in the farther corners of the room. With multiple inlet vents, a mixed-ventilation system offers improved control over the whole airflow field inside the domain. The upper zone between the two symmetrically located inlet vents shows some stagnation but in the occupied zone, the air is well mixed due to the presence of two supply openings Fig. 13 y-velocity and temperature contour of the isolation room in the x-y plane (z = 1.525 m) and the z-y plane (x = 2.44 m). Three air supply inlets are located on the ceiling and the patient is close to exhaust sidewall. a, c show v velocity and temperature contour in the x-y plane and b, d v velocity and temperature contour in the z-y plane towards the corners of the room. This arrangement makes the whole room well ventilated. However, higher draught ratings must be expected in such a ventilation system. The position of the patient bed and air supply inlet of isolation room for two kinds of patients: infectious and immune-suppressed were simulated using in-house CFD solver. An immune-suppressed patient is one who is vulnerable to infection from any contaminant that accompanies the supply air. The location of the bed and the ventilation system for such a system should be designed to provide the patient maximum protection against the possible contamination in the supply air by ensuring that contaminant resident time inside the room is minimum.",
