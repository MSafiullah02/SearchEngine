Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China, now there are confirmed cases in multiple countries and there are many health care workers who have been infected while they were unprotected or improperly protected. As the 2019-nCoV is highly contagious and the transmission dynamics is still not fully understood [1], in large hospitals, such as Sichuan provincial people\u2019s hospital which has more than 4000 beds and a large number of outpatient visits every day, it was necessary to establish a hospital-specific protocol to deal with the new coronavirus infection.",

The infectious disease physician, the respiratory physician and an emergency medical physician became a fever diagnosis and screening team to triage the patients who have fever. The specific flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. For highly suspected patients, the rule is to enter the isolation ward and wait for the results of the New Coronavirus nucleic acid test and of the radiology examination. If the suspected patient is confirmed, then he enters the emergency ward for treatment. During the screening process, the medical staff must wear masks, wash their hands and put on isolation clothes to make sure not to be infected by 2019-nCoV carriers. The opening of the online clinics has reduced the number of common flu patients visiting hospitals, and consultation can be conducted at the online clinics.",

It was officially put into use on February 4, 2020. The enhanced biosafety secondary laboratory is particularly suitable for related operations that pose pathogenic microorganisms threats to humans or the environment. In addition, we have established a special radiology examination route to perform X-ray or CT examinations for highly suspected and confirmed patients, thus reducing the chance of cross-infection with other patients, and protecting the safety of medical staff. We used the ultrasound to evaluate the pulmonary disease, if necessary, so that we can reduce the risk of infection transmission among patients being transported.",

This is not only a huge challenge for medical resources, but also a huge psychological pressure on medical staff, so strict isolation and protection measures are top priority. Also, the epidemic period coincided with the Chinese New Year, and a large number of people returned to work from outside the hospital\u2019s region. Therefore, it is particularly important to conduct epidemiological screening of medical staff, especially enquiring about any Wuhan travel history and contact history with Wuhan people. We prepared a form and sent it to the WeChat group, asking each employee, as well as interns and residents, to report their epidemiological history. Once there was a high-risk or suspected person, strict isolation was required for 14 days. Training was carried out on hand hygiene, wearing isolation gowns, how to take nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and environmental disinfection through online video or WeChat. We also introduced robotic systems to deliver meals and supplies to patients, reducing contact between medical staff and carriers, and reducing the chance of infection. We introduced a strictly control at the gates of the hospital, divided into the staff entrance and the patient entrance, and automatically monitor the temperature for everyone who enters the hospital.",
