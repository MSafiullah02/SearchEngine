Podell, Fenner, and Powers adopted a nomenclature scheme from human epilepsies based on identifiable causes.10 Primary epileptic seizure (idiopathic) is the term used if an underlying cause cannot be identified. If seizures result from a structural lesion, they are defined as secondary epileptic seizures. The term reactive epileptic seizure is used when the normal brain reacts to transient systemic insult or physiological stresses; these seizures are not considered recurrent. Epilepsies also are described as asymptomatic (primary, idiopathic) and symptomatic (secondary).11 I use the terminology of primary and secondary epilepsies for this discussion. Secondary epilepsy is common in cats, and appropriate diagnostic tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause.2, 3, 5, 6\n",

Others classify secondary epilepsy (symptomatic) as recurrent episodes of seizure activity associated with an underlying structural disorder such as inflammation, trauma, ongoing hypoxia or ischemia, or neoplasia.2, 3, 9 In cases of secondary epilepsy, partial seizures (focal or complex partial with or without secondary generalization) are observed more commonly and may be accompanied by an abnormal neurological examination with or without lateralization.

Generalized seizures (tonic-clonic or grand-mal seizures) manifest as loss of consciousness, recumbency, and tonic-clonic motor activity. The major motor activity can consist of generalized tonic movements with the limbs in rigid extension and purposeless limb movements and paddling. Opisthotonus and claw extension in addition to mouth-chomping and pupillary dilation also may be observed. At times, tonic flexion (emprosthotonus) is observed, which may be followed by moderate to severe muscle twitching (clonic phase). The patient may not have loss of consciousness during this type of event. Sometimes generalized seizures can be violent. The cat may jump up into the air as if it were thrown and propel itself forward and from side to side. Autonomic release (urination and defecation) usually accompanies the motor activity in addition to facial twitching, salivation, kicking, piloerection, and chewing (Figure 55-1\n). Self-inflicted trauma may be observed to include contusions, excoriations, biting of the tongue, or avulsion of the claws. Cats also may exhibit mild or nonconvulsive seizures, which are manifested by impaired consciousness, pupillary dilation, bilateral facial twitching, muscle spasms of the head and neck, and possibly, autonomic release.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 The ictus usually lasts from seconds to minutes and sometimes can progress to status epilepticus.",

Salivation, urination, and pupillary dilation are transient signs. Continuous vocalization and a brief rise in body temperature can be observed. Hyperthermia ensues as a result of continuous motor activity that can last from minutes to hours. Partial motor seizures are variable in clinical presentation and difficult to recognize for the untrained eye.2, 5, 6 Also, partial seizures may progress to tonic-clonic or generalized seizures. Seizures of this type may be more difficult to control because of the prolonged ictal phase. Up to one third of cats have seizures that progress to status epilepticus or cluster seizures. Cats also may have an atypical presentation of nonconvulsive seizures that go undetected for prolonged periods.2, 6, 12, 13 Requesting the pet owner to videotape these episodes is helpful to document the severity and type of seizure.",

A myriad of metabolic imbalances and toxic substances act synergistically to produce neurological signs. The major contributor to the clinical signs observed is hyperammonemia5, 14 (see Chapter 11). Mercaptans, indoles, and aromatic amino acids also play a role in abnormal neurotransmission and generation of false neurotransmitters available for use in the brain. Increases in excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and alterations in endogenous benzodiazepines have been documented in animals with seizures. High cerebral concentrations of these benzodiazepine-like substances may explain the relative rarity of seizures in cats with HE. The exact role of these metabolic by-products in the generation of seizures has not been determined (Figure 55-3\n).",

Increase in sympathetic tone (release of norepinephrine and epinephrine) leads to adrenergic signs of tachycardia, dilated pupils, tremors, irritability, and vocalization (see Chapter 20). Because the brain relies on passive diffusion of glucose, and it is deprived of its energy substrates, signs progress rostral to caudal.14 The cerebrocortical neurons are more susceptible to the effects of hypoglycemia.

The role of hyperthyroidism as a cause for seizures may be linked to the ability of thyroid hormones to decrease the electrical threshold of cerebral tissue directly. Other proposed mechanisms include changes in cerebral oxygen and glucose utilization, altered cerebral blood flow, and altered concentrations of neurotransmitters.5, 14, 17 Systemic effects of hyperthyroidism have been discussed elsewhere. CNS signs include restlessness, irritability, aggression, hyperexcitability, aimless wandering, pacing, circling, abnormal sleep/wake patterns, generalized or partial motor seizures, and acute focal neurological deficits (similar to cerebrovascular accidents).5, 17 Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is based upon elevated T4 concentrations and nuclear scintigraphy (see Chapter 21). Treatment includes medications that decrease the production of thyroid hormone, radioactive iodine therapy, and surgical excision of the adenomatous thyroid tissue (see Chapter 22).

Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may lead to myelinolysis (not described in cats) in the thalamus and pons, a sequela of osmotic shifts and blood-brain barrier disruption.",

These signs include vomiting, ptyalism, lacrimation, diarrhea, and, on occasion, hyperactivity and seizure activity. Diagnosis is based upon the history of ingestion and clinical signs. Treatment consists of parasympatholytic agents, supportive care, and antiepileptic drug therapy. Atropine counteracts the muscarinic effects of OP or carbamate toxicity. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM, Protopam Chloride, Wyeth-Ayerst) is administered as soon as possible after exposure. 2-PAM disrupts the bond between the OP and acetylcholinesterase to form a complex that is eliminated in the urine. 2-PAM is most effective if administered within the first several hours after exposure before the OP \u201cage\u201d with time. Diphenhydramine is recommended to counteract the nicotinic effects of OP toxicity.

Long-term maintenance therapy often is indicated with persistent seizure activity.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 27 Realistic goals of AED therapy are to decrease the frequency of the seizures, reduce their severity, and enhance the quality of life for the patient and pet owner. The prognosis should not be based upon the severity of the seizure. Some cats who present with status epilepticus may respond extremely well to anticonvulsant therapy. In my experience, early aggressive therapy is the key to seizure control in acute and chronic situations. Patients refractory to medication need reevaluation for progression of the intracranial disease not addressed previously, assessment of owner compliance, and additional monitoring for drug tolerance. Many owners may have difficulty administering oral medications to their cats and need to be educated about consistency of drug administration and routine drug monitoring. Journal documentation of seizure activity is a useful tool for assessment of medication compliance.",

            "text": "Phenobarbital is the AED therapy of choice for control of seizures in cats. Pharmacokinetics have been well established and most veterinary laboratories perform routine drug monitoring. Phenobarbital is relatively safe and inexpensive and has proven efficacy for seizure control in cats. The recommended dose is 1.25 to 2.5 mg/kg PO q12h. The elimination half-life in cats can range between 43 and 76 hours. Steady-state serum concentration is achieved within 9 to 16 days of starting therapy. Serum drug concentrations ideally should be measured within 2 to 3 weeks of initiating therapy or after a change in dosage. Therapeutic blood levels are similar to those reported in dogs (25 to 40 \u03bcg/ml). Optimal recommended therapeutic target range for serum phenobarbital concentrations for cats is between 23 and 30 \u03bcg/ml. This target range maximizes seizure control with fewer side effects.1, 9, 24, 27, 28, 29 The pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital in cats are less predictable than in dogs. Phenobarbital is metabolized primarily by the liver. Establishing a baseline of liver function using pre- and post-bile acid testing is recommended before initiating maintenance phenobarbital doses.6 Serum concentrations should be evaluated every 6 months.2, 7, 8 Periodic monitoring of the complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and bile acids is recommended. Side effects of phenobarbital include sedation, ataxia, polyphagia, and weight gain. Sedation and ataxia usually are transient and subside within 1 to 2 weeks after initial administration or a change in dose, although exceptions do occur.6 Cats are considered sensitive to the sedative effects of AEDs, related to a slower elimination rate. The dose should start low and increase incrementally. In my experience, drug-associated polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia occur less commonly in cats than in dogs. Rare idiosyncratic reactions include blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), hepatotoxicity, dermatitis, and persistent, unusual behavioral disturbances.6, 24\n",

            "text": "Potassium bromide has gained popularity as an adjunctive AED therapy in cats with seizures when phenobarbital alone is ineffective for adequate seizure control.6, 7, 8, 27, 31, 32 Bromide is absorbed in the proximal small intestine and is eliminated through the kidneys. The half-life has been reported to be 13 days in cats, roughly one third the time of that reported in dogs. The steady-state usually is attained within 2 months. Minimum therapeutic concentrations are reached within 3 weeks of initiating therapy. The recommended dose of bromide in cats is 20 to 30 mg/kg PO q24h.31, 32 The target range for serum bromide concentration is between 1.0 and 1.6 mg/ml.32 Adverse side effects occur in approximately 50 per cent of cats administered bromide. Side effects include polydipsia, vomiting, weight gain, sedation, and coughing. Coughing has a reported incidence in 35 to 42 per cent of cats.6, 8, 31, 32, 33 A study at Ohio State University reported 11 of 26 cats treated with bromide developed a persistent, nonproductive cough.33 Coughing is acute in onset and may be associated with dyspnea. Thoracic radiographs reveal mild to marked peribronchial infiltrates, similar to those observed with asthma. Bronchoalveolar lavage has revealed inflammatory changes with eosinophils dominating.8, 33 Withdrawal of the drug often results in resolution of clinical signs; however, three of 17 cats reportedly died from complications associated with drug administration. A thorough history of prior airway disease must be obtained before initiation of bromide therapy. The drug should be discontinued immediately if coughing is reported by the owner.6\n",

Diazepam alone usually is effective because of its longer half-life. If multiple bolus administration is ineffective, a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of diazepam at 0.5 mg/kg/hr is considered, taking care to protect it from light. I recommend administration of the CRI for up to 2 hours and reassessment of seizure control. Some authors recommend administration of the CRI for a minimum of 6 hours.2, 9 A bolus administration or CRI (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/hr) of phenobarbitol also can be administered. Propofol also has AED properties. A propofol CRI (0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/min) can be used short-term in cats. Heinz body production occurs in cats with repeated use of propofol. Heinz bodies are produced as a result of oxidative injury to RBCs. Bolus and CRI administration has potential for severe respiratory depression. Intratracheal intubation and additional ventilatory support may be necessary. Cats may be profoundly sedated after parenteral treatment with AEDs.9 Monitoring vital indices serially until the cat is acclimated to the AED is important. Additional supportive care includes fluid therapy, temperature regulation, oxygen supplementation, continuous electrocardiogram, and frequent turning. Blood glucose, electrolytes, and urine output are assessed frequently. Choice of a maintenance AED is considered while providing initial seizure control. See Table 55-3\nfor a summary of AED therapy in cats.",
