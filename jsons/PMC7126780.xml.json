            "text": "Over the last few years solid evidence has been provided of a remarkable antiviral effect of defined oxysterols, essentially of enzymatic origin [[1], [2], [3]]. These cholesterol derived molecules proved to be effective in inhibiting the replication of a wide span of viral pathogens, characterised by highly divergent replicative strategies and structural features. In this relation, the most studied member of this family has certainly been 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a physiological oxysterol whose production by the enzyme 25-cholesterol hydroxylase was proven to be interferon-inducible [1,2]. Moreover, a similarly strong inhibition of the replication of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses was demonstrated to be exerted as well by 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) [[4], [5], [6]], the product of the ubiquitous mitochondrial enzyme 27-cholesterol hydroxylase [7] and by far the most represented oxysterol in human plasma [8]. This unprecedented antiviral spectrum relies at least in part on the ability of oxysterols to modify the composition of cellular and subcellular membranes that all viral pathogens have to cross in order to enter the host cells or hijack their replicative machinery. These oxysterol-induced modifications can be triggered by different mechanisms such as (A) the direct interaction of oxysterols with cellular membranes, (B) the interaction with cellular proteins involved in cholesterol shuttling between intracellular membranes [such as the oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP)]], (C) the modulation of the expression of enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism, by binding specific nuclear receptors such as the liver X receptor [LXR] and the estrogen receptor \u03b1 [ER \u03b1] [3], or, last but not least, (D) a suitable potentiation of the initial inflammatory reaction by cells under viral attack, for instance through a redox-dependent up-regulation of NF-kB-driven overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6 [4].",

To this medium, the appropriate amino acids were added as follows: unlabelled l-lysine (Lys0) and l-arginine (Arg0) (both from Sigma) were used to obtain light-labelled cells, and 13C6\n15N4\nl-arginine (Arg10, CNLM-539, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory) and 13C6\n15N2\nl-lysine (Lys8, CNLM-291, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory) were used to obtain heavy-labelled cells.

After 20 h, cells were washed twice with sterile PBS, harvested and lysed in denaturing conditions. Extracted proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min, then separated by 12%-SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-12% PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 \u00b0C with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and milk powder 10%. Membranes were then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, washed 4 times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 15% milk powder, then incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with the secondary antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase and washed extensively prior to developing by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. The bands\u2019 density was compared using ImageJ software, and the intensity of the actin bands was used to normalize values. Where possible, the results were expressed as a percentage, by comparing treated cells with cells incubated with culture medium alone. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA).",

Indeed, several viruses have been shown to activate NF-kB signalling, usually in the first stages of the infection and in a transient way [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. The NF-kB-dependent induction of inflammatory cytokines synthesis would then contribute to counteract cell invasion by viral particles [[26], [27], [28]] and the recognized pro-inflammatory properties of oxysterols [29,30] could potentiate the cytokine production provoked by the virus, as actually demonstrated in cells infected with Herpes Simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) [4].

For instance, both investigated oxysterols strongly down-regulated cellular levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase, the key regulatory enzyme of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. This is consistent with previous literature, showing that 25-HC is a HMG-CoA reductase and synthase inhibitor [31] and, by means of this mechanism, it conveys an antiviral state in treated cells, particularly against flaviviruses, including hepatitits C virus [32]. Moreover, both oxysterols can down-regulate the expression of isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase 1, a crucial regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of isoprenoids. Interestingly, an excessive protein isoprenylation is correlated to cardiovascular and age-related disease [33], while the two oxysterols would act as quenchers of isoprenoids\u2019 synthesis.",

            "text": "MPRci, together with the cation dependent isoform MPRcd, is one of the specialized transporters of newly synthesized lysosomal factors, including cathepsins, from the Golgi apparatus to late endosomes (LE) [36]. It was very recently demonstrated that most rotavirus strains need the Golgi-LEs transporters MPRci and Sortilin-1 and their cargo cathepsins to efficiently infect Caco-2 and MA104 cells [37]. In this relation, both 25HC and 27HC proved to markedly inhibit rotavirus replication in the same cell lines [5,6]. In the report of Diaz-Salinas and colleagues [37], at least cathepsins B, L and S were involved in the Golgi-LE traffic modulated by MPRci. SILAC experiments showed a significant down-regulation of cathepsin D only in HeLa cells treated with 25HC and not with 27HC (Supplementary Material, Table S2). It cannot be excluded that also this isoform could contribute to the infectivity of at least defined rotavirus strains. More importantly, MPR appears to be pivotal for the replication of several other viruses. Vaccinia virus protein p37 localizes to the LE and interacts with proteins associated with LE-derived transport vesicle biogenesis such as MPR to facilitate assembly of extracellular forms of virus [38]. The HSV glycoprotein D (gD), which is essential for this virus to enter cells, can efficiently bind to MPRci, an interaction that plays a role in virus entry and egress [39]. In a recent study, Dohgu and colleagues showed that the MPR is involved in both the replicative cycle and the dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), facilitating the passing of HIV-1 through the blood brain barrier [40].",
