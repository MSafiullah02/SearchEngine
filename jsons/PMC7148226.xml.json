Also, the training regime and the input data transformations have to be just right [17] in order to beat or come close to well-tuned traditional IR baselines such as RM3 [2, 16]2. With the introduction of BERT in late 2018, this has finally changed.

[25]. The idea behind these datasets is simple: each dataset is designed to fulfil one retrieval axiom [9], i.e., a heuristic that a good retrieval function should fulfil3. Each dataset contains query-documents instances (most often, a query and two documents) that the investigated model should rank in the correct order as determined by the heuristic. The extent to which a model correctly ranks those instances is allowing us to gain insights into what type of information the retrieval model pays attention to (or not) when ranking documents. While traditional retrieval models such as BM25 [26] can be analysed analytically, neural nets with their millions or even billions of learnt weights can only be analysed in such an empirical manner.",

We extend previous work [25] by incorporating additional axioms (moving from term matching to semantic axioms). We find that DistilBERT to outperform the traditional query likelihood (QL) model by 40%. In contrast to our expectations however, we find that BERT does not adhere to any of the axioms we incorporate in our work. This implies that the currently existing axioms are not sufficient and not applicable to capture the heuristics that a strong supervised model learns (at least for the corpus and model we explore); it is not yet clear to what extent those results generalise beyond our model and corpus combination but it opens up a number of questions about the axiomatic approach to IR.",

The use of axioms (or \u201cretrieval heuristics\u201d) as a means to improve and understand information retrieval techniques is well established. It is an analytic technique to explore retrieval models and how best to improve them. In their seminal work, Fang et al. [9, 10] introduced a number of term-matching based heuristics that models should follow in order to be successful in retrieval tasks. Subsequently, Fang et al. [11] proposed a set of axioms based on semantic matching and thus allowing non-exact matches to be accounted for in axiomatic retrieval. We apply these axioms in our work\u2014albeit in a slightly adapted manner. Other applications for axioms in IR include document re-ranking based on a Learning to Rank scenario [13] and query expansion [8] by exploring similar axioms. It should be noted, that\u2014while sensible\u2014it cannot be assumed that these axioms are a good fit for all kinds of corpora; they represent a general notion of how a good retrieval function should behave. Recently, Rennings et al. [25] introduced diagnostic datasets extracted from actual corpora that each fulfil one axiom. In contrast to the axiomatic approach, which requires an analytical evaluation of the retrieval functions under investigation, a diagnostic corpus enables us to analyse models\u2019 axiomatic performance that are too large to be analysed analytically (such as neural models with millions or even billions of parameters5). Our work continues in that direction with a larger number of axioms (9 vs. 4) and the analysis of the current neural state-of-the-art (i.e., BERT).",

With similar success, Dai and Callan [6] have recently employed another BERT variant on Robust04 and ClueWeb09.

By now a great number of works have tried to light up the black box of the neural learning models [1], with varying degrees of success. Within IR, Pang et al. [22] have aimed to paint a complete and high-level picture of the neural IR area, comparing the behaviour of different approaches, and showing that interaction and representation-based models focus on different characteristics of queries and documents. While insightful, such work does not enable us to gain deep insights into a single model. Closer to our work, Rosset et al.

In contrast, in IR the central notion is relevance and although we know that it can be decomposed into various types (topical, situational, etc.) of relevance [29], we have no easy way of creating datasets for each of these\u2014it remains a time-intensive and expensive task. This also explains why corpora such as Robust04 remain useful and in use for such a long time. Instead, like Rennings et al. [25] we turn to the axiomatic approach to IR and create diagnostic datasets\u2014one for each of our chosen retrieval heuristics. It has been shown that, generally, retrieval functions that fulfil these heuristics achieve a greater effectiveness than those that do not. In contrast to [25] which restricted itself to four term matching axioms, we explore a wider range of axioms, covering term frequency, document length, lower-bounding term frequency, semantic term matching and term proximity constraints. In total, we explore 9 axioms, all of which are listed in Table 1 with a short informal description of their main assumption of what a sensible retrieval function should fulfil. We note that this covers most of the term-matching and semantic-matching axioms that have been proposed. We have eliminated a small number from our work as we do not consider them relevant to BERT (e.g., those designed for pseudo-relevance feedback [5]).",

This description is sufficient to mathematically analyse classic retrieval functions, but not suitable for models with more than a handful of parameters. We thus turn to the creation of datasets that exclusively contain instances of query/documents (for STMC1 an instance is a triple, consisting of one query and two documents) that satisfy a particular axiom. As single-term queries and documents offer no realistic test bed, we extend (moving beyond single-term queries and documents) and relax (moving beyond strict requirements such as equal document length) the axioms in order to extract instances from existing datasets that fulfil the requirements of the extended and relaxed axiom. Importantly, this process requires no relevance judgements\u2014we can simply scan all possible triples in the corpus (consisting of queries and documents) and add those to our diagnostic dataset that fulfil our requirements. We then score each query/document pair with our BERT model6 and determine whether the score order of the documents is in line with the axiom. If it is, we consider our model to have classified this instance correctly.",

In order to further explore this tension between semantic and syntactic term matching, we split the queries in our test set by their term overlap between the query and the relevant document (if several relevant documents exist for a query, we randomly picked one of them).

We report results for all queries (Fig. 1 (left)), as well as only those where the relevant document appears in the top-100 QL ranking (Fig. 1 (right)). We find that BERT outperforms QL across all three splits, indicating that BERT is indeed able to pick up the importance of syntactic term matching. At the same time, as expected, BERT is performing significantly better than QL for queries that require a large amount of semantic matching. That brings into question on why, then, the axiomatic performance across our semantic axiomatic datasets does not reflect that. One hypothesis is that the semantic similarity we measure (based on context-free word embeddings) is different to the semantic similarity measured via contextual word embeddings.
