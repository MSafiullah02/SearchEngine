Among these, the trypsin-like serine proteases comprise one of the best characterized subfamilies due to their essential roles in blood coagulation, food digestion, fibrinolysis, or immunity. Trypsin-like serine proteases possess primary substrate specificity for basic amino acids. Most of the well-characterized trypsin-like proteases such as trypsin, plasmin, or urokinase are soluble proteases that are secreted into the extracellular environment. At the turn of the millennium, a number of novel trypsin-like serine proteases have been identified that are anchored in the cell membrane, either by a transmembrane domain at the N-or C-terminus or via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. Meanwhile more than 20 membrane-anchored serine proteases (MASPs) have been identified in human and mouse, and some of them have emerged as key regulators of mammalian development and homeostasis. Thus, the MASP corin and TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 have been demonstrated to be the activators of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and key regulator of hepcidin expression, respectively. Furthermore, MASPs have been recognized as host cell factors activating respiratory viruses including influenza virus as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. In particular, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to be essential for proteolytic activation and consequently spread and pathogenesis of a number of influenza A viruses in mice and as a factor associated with severe influenza virus infection in humans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "This review gives an overview on the physiological functions of the fascinating and rapidly evolving group of MASPs and a summary of the current knowledge on their role in proteolytic activation of viral fusion proteins. 8 154 8.1 Fig. 8.2 Crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human DESC1.

DESC1 was first identified as a gene downregulated in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Lang and Schuller 2001) . Moreover, induction of normal keratinocyte differentiation by calcium challenge was accompanied by an increase in DESC1 expression in vitro (Sedghizadeh et al. 2006) . A recent study found that DESC1 sensitizes cells to apoptosis by downregulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/AKT pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Ng et al. 2016) . Protease activity was required for this function, suggesting that DESC1 cleaves EGFR, which subsequently leads to the downregulation of the AKT pathway. Moreover, DESC1 has been demonstrated to reduce tumor growth kinetics in an orthotopic nude mouse model for study of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Taken together, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the association of DESC1 downregulation with cancer development. However, its tumor suppressive role remains to be characterized in more detail in future studies.

In 1939, Moses Kunitz demonstrated that purified porcine enteropeptidase converts crystalline trypsinogen to trypsin (Kunitz 1939) . In the 1970s, purification of enteropeptidase from porcine, bovine, and human intestine revealed that it consists of a heavy chain (82-140 kDa) and a light chain (35-62 kDa) connected by a disulfide bond. Edman degradation of the amino-terminal sequence of the light chain of bovine enteropeptidase revealed its homology to other trypsin-like proteases. However, only cloning of the enteropeptidase cDNA in 1994 revealed the presence of a membrane anchor near the amino-terminus and indicated that the active two-chain form is derived from a single-chain precursor (Kitamoto et al. 1994 ). Enteropeptidase activity is almost exclusively localized to the duodenum. The enzyme is localized in the brush border of enterocytes and some goblet cells of the human duodenal mucosa and, at lower levels, in the mucosa of the proximal jejunum (Hermon-Taylor et al. 1977; Yuan et al. 1998 ).

A number of mechanisms, by which TMPRSS4 may modulate tumor cell proliferation and invasion, have been described in vitro. Overexpression of TMPRSS4 in colon cancer cells promoted EMT through the upregulation of integrin \u03b15, thereby enhancing motility and invasiveness ). In addition, TMPRSS4 was shown to induce invasion through upregulation of both expression and activity of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) via activation of the transcription factors AP-1, Sp1, and Sp3 and via processing of pro-uPA precursor into its active form in vitro (Min et al. 2014a, b) . The serine protease uPA converts inactive plasminogen to active plasmin, which in turn can degrade most extracellular proteins and activate MMPs. Moreover, uPA and its receptor, uPAR (CD87), interact with integrin coreceptors to activate intracellular signaling pathways for cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Hildenbrand et al. 2008) . It has been shown that TMPRSS4 can interact with uPAR (Min et al. 2014b) . Furthermore, TMPRSS4 has been shown to induce downregulation of E-cadherin, a well-known hallmark of EMT, via activation of transcriptional repressors Sip1/Zeb2 (Jung et al. 2008) .

Matriptase is encoded by the ST14 gene located on human chromosome 11q24-25 and encodes a polypeptide of 855 amino acids with a molecular weight of 95 kDa (Lin et al. 1999) . Orthologs of matriptase are present in all vertebrate genomes examined to date (review Miller and List 2013) . Matriptase shows the most ubiquitous expression pattern of TTSPs being expressed in epithelial cells of most embryonic and adult tissues (Miller and List 2013) . Matriptase has been shown to be required for postnatal survival in mice and has essential physiological functions in terminal differentiation of the oral and intestinal epithelium and the epidermis (List et al. 2002 (List et al. , 2003 Buzza et al. 2010) . Mice deficient in matriptase die within 48 h after birth due to a severe dehydration resulting from an impaired epidermal barrier function.

These observations led to the hypothesis that matriptase may be part of a matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade in the epidermis (Netzel-Arnett et al. 2006) . Moreover, this cascade has been shown to regulate different steps in terminal epidermal differentiation: tight junction formation, profilaggrin processing, epidermal lipid synthesis, and induction of desquamation through promoting expression or activation of kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) (for review see Szabo and Bugge 2011) . It remains to be analyzed in more detail which target substrates of the matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade are involved in the different steps of epidermal differentiation. A number of studies during the last years, however, revealed that the matriptase-prostasin cascade is much more complex.

Systemic iron homeostasis is maintained by regulating the iron absorption in the duodenum, by recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes in macrophages, and by mobilizing stored iron in the liver. Increases in iron levels stimulate the production of the hepatic hormone hepcidin, which blocks iron export into the circulation by binding to and targeting the iron exporter ferroportin on the plasma membrane of duodenal enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes for degradation. Hepcidin production is suppressed in the case of iron deficiency (reviewed in Ganz and Nemeth 2012 and Wang et al. 2014) . Therefore, hepcidin is a key regulator of intestinal iron absorption, plasma iron concentrations, and tissue iron distribution. Lack of hepcidin causes juvenile hemochromatosis, a particularly severe form of iron overload disorder.

However, acrosin-deficient mice were fully fertile, although they displayed delayed sperm penetration of the ZP at the early stage of fertilization in vitro (Baba et al. 1994) , indicating that additional serine protease(s) play important roles in the regulation of male fertility.

For a large number of viruses, cleavage of the fusion protein occurs either at a single arginine (R\u2193) by trypsin-like proteases or at a multibasic motif of the consensus sequence R-X-R/K-R\u2193 by ubiquitous expressed subtilisin-like proteases such as furin and proprotein convertase 5/6 (PC5/6) (see Chap. 9). The first report of proteolytic activation of viral fusion proteins was published in 1973 in a study using Sendai virus. It was demonstrated that the viral glycoprotein F is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is converted into its biological active form due to cleavage by a host cell protease and that F cleavage is a prerequisite for infectivity and multicycle virus replication (Homma and Ohuchi 1973; Scheid and Choppin 1974) . In the following years, striking differences in glycoprotein activation have been observed with Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza viruses, which proved to be important determinants of the pathogenicity of these viruses (Nagai et al. 1976; Bosch et al. 1981) . In 1992, the proprotein convertase furin was identified as protease that activates the hemagglutinin of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) strains at multibasic motifs (Stieneke-Gr\u00f6ber et al. 1992 ; reviewed by W. Garten in another chapter of this book) (Fig. 8.3a, b) . Furin which is expressed in all tissues is responsible for the systemic infection typical for these viruses. However, less was known about the identity of the protease(s) that support HA cleavage at a single arginine residue. (CoVs), respectively, and cleavage sites (red arrows). HA0 is cleaved into HA1 and HA2; both subunits remain linked by a disulfide bond. HA0 of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses is activated at a multibasic cleavage site, while HA0 of low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses and mammalian influenza A viruses is cleaved at a single basic residue. CoV S protein is cleaved at two distinct sites at monobasic motifs or the minimal furin consensus motif RXXR. The S1 and S2 domains are not held by disulfide bonds but remain associated non-covalently (Millet and Whittaker 2015) . . HA and S require cleavage by host cell proteases to gain their fusion capacity. In the case of influenza A virus, newly synthesized HA is cleaved during its transport to the plasma membrane by furin (multibasic cleavage site) or TMPRSS2 (monobasic cleavage site) in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or at the cell surface by HAT during assembly and budding of progeny virus. Thus, virus containing cleaved HA is released from infected cells. HA can also be cleaved by HAT on the cell surface prior to entry into a new cell. In contrast, TMPRSS2 present on the cell surface does not support HA cleavage. It remains unclear whether HAT is enzymatically active within the cell and thus can cleave HA already during its transit to the plasma membrane. Most CoVs, including SARS-and human 229E-CoVs, are released with non-cleaved S from the infected cells, indicating that S is not activated during its transit through the exocytic pathway. Therefore, the S protein of CoV is activated upon entry into the host cell. Entry can take place via fusion at or close to the plasma membrane or in early endosomes (\"early entry\") and may be pH-independent or via late fusion in late endosomes (\"late entry\") in a low pH-dependent manner. Early or late fusion seems to be dependent on the protease(s) that cleave S at the S2' site. Cleavage of S by furin and TTSPs is believed to support an early entry (e.g., MERS-CoV), whereas activation of S by cathepsins supports late entry via fusion in late endosomes (e.g., mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59) (Burkard et al. 2014; Millet and Whittaker 2015; Park et al. 2016) . Newly synthesized S protein of some CoV, including MERS-CoV, has been reported to be cleaved by furin or TTSPs in the exocytic pathway, but the role of S cleavage in the secretory pathway for virus-cell and cell-cell fusion remains to be investigated in more detail.

Kido in this book. However, the genetic identity is still unknown for many of these enzymes, and it remains unclear whether they play a role in in vivo infection. Relevant HA-activating proteases in the human airways were unknown for a long time. Cleavage of HA by soluble proteases such as trypsin in cell culture takes place outside the cells during assembly and budding of new virions when HA is present on the plasma membrane or after progeny virus is released from the infected cell. Thus, it was believed for a long time that HA with a monobasic cleavage site is activated extracellularly and, therefore, differs from HA of HPAIV, which is cleaved in the TGN by furin.

Furthermore, the sensitivity of 16 HA subtypes to cleavage by TMPRSS2, HAT, and pancreatic trypsin was demonstrated to vary significantly among the different subtypes (Galloway et al. 2013 ; see also Chap. 1). Interestingly, studies in TMPRSS2-deficient mouse models demonstrated that differences in the sensitivity of HA to cleavage by host proteases may affect influenza virus spread and pathogenesis (Hatesuer et al. 2013; Tarnow et al. 2014; Sakai et al. 2014 ) (see below).

The subcellular localization and enzymatic activity of HAT and TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells have not been investigated in more detail so far but have been studied in MDCK cells that proved to be a suitable model system (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2009 ). Interestingly, it was demonstrated that activation of influenza virus HA by HAT and TMPRSS2 differs in subcellular localization and can take place at different steps of the viral life cycle (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2009; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010 Fig. 8.3b ). Incubation of HAT-expressing MDCK cells with fluorogenic peptides to measure the protease activity on the cell surface revealed that HAT is present as an enzymatically active protease on the cell surface. In addition, it was shown that HAT is capable of cleaving newly synthesized HA0, probably during assembly and budding of new virions on the plasma membrane, as well as HA0 of incoming influenza virus at the stage of entry during attachment to a new host cell. In contrast, only poor if any enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 was measured on the surface of TMPRSS2-expressing MDCK cells, and the cells were not able to support activation of incoming influenza virions containing HA0, although TMPRSS2 was present as both zymogen and mature form on the surface of MDCK cells (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010 ). Cleavage of HA was found to take place intracellularly during its transport through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane ( Fig. 8.3b ). Immunofluorescence studies of transient TMPRSS2 expression in mammalian cells revealed that the protease accumulates in the TGN, where it co-localizes with furin, suggesting that HA cleavage by TMPRSS2 and furin occurs in the same cellular compartment . These data were in agreement with earlier studies by Zhirnov et al. that showed that cleavage of HA in human respiratory or intestinal epithelial cells occurs intracellularly and is performed by cell-associated proteases (Zhirnov et al. 2002; Zhirnov and Klenk 2003) . These studies provided further evidence that cleavage of influenza virus HA can occur at different steps of the viral life cycle: during transport of HA along the secretory pathway to the cell surface, on the plasma membrane during assembly and budding, and late in infection upon entry into new cells (Boycott et al. 1994; Zhirnov et al. 2002; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010) . However, shedding of TTSPs may be enhanced under stress, and soluble forms might contribute to virus activation under such conditions. For example, enhanced shedding of TMPRSS2 and HAT from human nasal epithelial cells and hence enhanced influenza virus replication have been observed upon exposure to ozone in vitro (Kesic et al. 2012) . Studies on proteolytic activation of the spike protein S of human CoV including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by HAT and TMPRSS2 revealed also that viruses may have different options to be activated by host cell proteases during the viral replication cycle (Fig. 8.3b ). CoV S proteins possess two distinct cleavage sites, S1/S2 and S2', and can be cleaved by a number of proteases, including furin, cathepsin L, and trypsin, and trypsin-like proteases such as the TTSP HAT, TMPRSS2, DESC1, and MSPL (reviewed in Millet and Whittaker 2015, and Chap. 4 this book; see also Fig. 8.3 ). Cleavage of S by cathepsins occurs in late endosomes or lysosomes and is pH dependent, whereas activation by TTSPs may support cathepsin-and low pH-independent CoV entry via fusion in early endosomes in vitro (Burkard et al. 2014; Millet and Whittaker 2015; Park et al. 2016) . Both HAT and TMPRSS2 are believed to cleave S at or close to the cell surface (for review see Chap. 4). It remains to be investigated whether TMPRSS2 and/or HAT are present (and active) in endosomes. It further remains to be investigated why TMPRSS2 may cleave CoV S but not influenza virus HA at the cell surface. For some CoV, receptor binding has been shown to be required for proteolytic activation of S. Treatment of SARS-CoV particles with trypsin prior to binding to its receptor angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inactivates the virions in vitro, whereas SARS-CoV particles bound to its receptor are activated by trypsin for membrane fusion (cf. Chap. 4). Moreover, TMPRSS2 has been shown to cleave ACE2 and thereby to increase SARS-CoV S uptake into ACE2-expressing cells in vitro (Heurich et al. 2014 ). Thus, receptor binding of S or interactions of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 might trigger S cleavage by TMPRSS2 at the plasma membrane.

Intriguingly, knockout of TMPRSS2 expression prevented virus activation and consequently spread into the lungs and thereby protected the animals from influenza pathogenesis, whereas wild-type littermates succumbed to severe infection. These studies also revealed that other TTSPs that activate H1N1 virus in vitro, such as HAT/TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS4, DESC1, or MSPL, do not support HA activation in mice in vivo. For HAT/ TMPRSS11D, this can be explained by the fact that the protease is expressed in the upper airways, trachea, and bronchi of mice, but is not present in the lungs and, thus, cannot support influenza virus pneumotropism (Sales et al. 2011; Tarnow et al. 2014 ). The same is probably true for DESC1. However, TMPRSS4 and MSPL/TMPRSS13 are present in lung tissue (K\u00fchn et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2001) , and it remains unclear why both proteases do not support activation of H1N1 and H7N9 influenza virus in the airways of TMPRSS2-deficient mice. Noteworthy, replication of human H3N2 influenza A virus and influenza B virus (IBV) was almost independent of TMPRSS2 expression in mice, indicating that H3 and IBV HA can be activated by additional host proteases in contrast to H1 and H7 (Tarnow et al. 2014; Sakai et al. 2016) . In a recent study, knockout of both TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS2 caused reduced body weight loss and mortality upon H3N2 influenza A virus infection in mice in comparison with wild-type animals, indicating that both proteases contribute to activation of H3N2 virus in mice (K\u00fchn et al. 2016) . Nonetheless, H3N2 influenza A virus was still proteolytically activated in TMPRSS2-TMPRSS4-knockout mice and caused severe disease with 30% mortality, indicating that another H3-cleaving protease(s) is present in murine airways.

It will be very interesting to analyze the role of TMPRSS2 and further TTSPs in activation and pathogenicity of other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and human parainfluenza viruses using suitable mouse models. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the TMPRSS2 gene that results in higher TMPRSS2 expression has been associated with increased susceptibility to H1N1 and H7N9 influenza virus and higher risk of severe infection, suggesting that TMPRSS2 may play a crucial role in influenza virus activation also in humans (Cheng et al. 2015) . This view is supported by the observation that knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression in the human airway epithelial cell line Calu-3 strongly suppressed activation and multicycle replication of human H1N1 influenza A viruses (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2011) . Interestingly, knockdown of TMPRSS2 also strongly suppressed H3N2 virus replication in Calu-3 cells, suggesting that the differences in protease specificity of influenza virus HA observed in mice might be less pronounced in humans.

This may be relevant particularly for unusual di-or multibasic cleavage site motifs that are not cleaved by furin. H9N2 viruses in Asia and the Middle East have acquired dibasic cleavage site motif R-S-S/R-R that are not activated by furin.

Matriptase is widely expressed in multiple epithelial tissues and, therefore, may affect H9N2 virus spread, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity.

However, for many MASPs the physiological functions and/or substrates are not fully characterized or still unknown at all. The TTSP TMPRSS2 was identified as influenza A virus-activating protease in human airway cells and in mice and as host cell factor essential for pneumotropism and pathogenesis of certain influenza A virus strains infecting humans in mice. The role of TMPRSS2 in activation of further respiratory viruses in vivo remains to be investigated, and its important role in influenza virus activation in humans needs to be demonstrated. As mentioned above, a number of TTSPs that have been shown to activate HA in vitro and to be present in the respiratory tract, including TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS13, were not able to compensate for the lack of TMPRSS2 expression in influenza virus activation in mice. Thus, if there is some redundancy among MASPs in processing of physiological substrates, and this is very likely, it is not the case for cleavage of HA. The underlying reasons are unclear so far. Detailed information on the substrate specificity of TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4 is missing due to the lack of suitable systems for expression and purification of these proteases and available structural information of the protease domains. To date, the crystal structure of the protease domain has been solved for hepsin, DESC1, enteropeptidase, matriptase, and prostasin. Moreover, differences in (1) subcellular compartmentalization and activity, (2) expression levels, and/or (3) distribution in different airway cell types of TMPRSS2 in comparison with other TTSPs might account for the observed differences in activation of influenza A viruses. In particular, the compartmentalization of MASP activity should be investigated in more detail in future studies. MASPs are predicted to act as active enzymes on the cell surface, but studies on activation of influenza A virus HA by TMPRSS2 showed that cleavage takes place intracellularly, probably in the TGN. Thus, some MASPs may process their substrates already (or even exclusively) in intracellular compartments. Expression and enzymatic activity of MASPs in endosomes and lysosomes have not been studied so far but may play a role in processing of both physiological substrates and viral fusion proteins. Furthermore, the role of soluble MASP activity due to shedding of the catalytic domain is poorly understood. Dysregulated MASP activities are associated with a number of pathophysiological processes, and specific inhibitors may provide promising pharmaceutical tools for the treatment of cancer, iron overload, or respiratory diseases. Potent inhibitors for some MASPs have already been developed (for review see Steinmetzer and Hardes, this book), but no inhibitor of host proteases has been approved for the treatment of virus infections to date. The development of highly selective MASP inhibitors is hampered by the lack of available crystal structures of the catalytic domain as well as knowledge on the role of the different domains of the stem region in substrate specificity, protease conformation, and proteinprotein interactions. It remains to be analyzed whether some TTSPs are upregulated during virus infection and thereby may support enhanced virus activation and/or organ tropism. Moreover, it will be interesting to analyze whether dysregulation of MASPs contributes to the susceptibility to virus infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Remarks and Key Research Questions"}, {"text": "The protection of TMPRSS2 knockout mice from influenza A virus pathogenesis strikingly demonstrated the crucial role of virus activation for viral spread in the host.
