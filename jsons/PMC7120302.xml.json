These four studies collectively represent a progressive endeavor to elicit students\u2019 reasoning and decision-making on SSIs and help them to reflect on their reasoning through specially designed strategies that include cross contextual or cross-cultural exchanges. The participants in these studies were mainly senior secondary students in Hong Kong and other locations. The relative merits of these strategies for improving students\u2019 reasoning are discussed, drawing on the insights gained from these studies.",

            "text": "Socioscientific issues ( SSIs) have been used as a learning context for both science and educational courses. The SSI movement has grown out of the science-technology-society ( STS) or science, technology, society, and environment ( STSE) approaches, which emphasize the interactions among science, technology, and society. It is strongly linked with the \u201cScience for All\u201d movement and the curricular goal of developing students\u2019 scientific literacy. Recently, the traditional STS movement has split into two main movements. The first is SSI education, which focuses on the development of multi-perspective thinking, critical reasoning, argumentation, and value judgment through decision-making on SSIs. In the Hong Kong science curricula at senior secondary levels (e.g., CDC and HKEAA 2007a), these attributes are manifested as STSE connections. The second movement emphasizes the relationship among science, technology, and engineering and the crosscutting concepts that connect these three disciplinary areas (NRC 2012). This approach is intended to bring engineering practices to the fore and to bridge science and technology. Engineering is seen as a process in which scientific knowledge is applied to achieve technological ends through design and systematic testing, including experimentation (NRC 2012). This new emphasis is in response to the twenty-first-century need to develop human capacity in science, technology, and engineering. However, this view of engineering is contentious as it implies technology and engineering are applied sciences, which oversimplifies the relationships between technology and science (Van Eijck and Claxton 2008). This section briefly reviews studies on the SSI movement in the context of STS, with a particular focus on the reasoning involved in decision-making about SSIs among young people.",

            "text": "Decision-making on SSIs is widely associated with the ability to informally reason (e.g., Sadler 2004; Sadler and Zeidler 2005; Wu and Tsai 2007), which includes reasoning about cause-effect relationships from multiple perspectives, weighing the pros and cons of decision (Means and Voss 1996; Zohar and Nemet 2002; Ranyard et al. 1997), moral and ethical reasoning (e.g., Zeidler and Keefer 2003; Zeidler and Sadler 2008), and reasoning based on values (Grace 2002, 2009). Millar and Osborne (1998)\nargued that in considering these kinds of issues, students should be taught to \u201cdistinguish between technical issues (what is possible) and ethical issues (what ought to be done)\u201d (p. 2022). Research has identified several factors that influence students\u2019 reasoning about SSIs, including prior beliefs, personal consequences (Sadler and Zeidler 2004), the ideas of probability and risk (Levinson et al. 2011; Millar and Osborne 1998), personal values (Bell and Lederman 2003), the capability of moral and ethical reasoning (e.g., Zeidler and Keefer 2003; Zeidler and Sadler 2008), argumentation skills (Foong and Daniel 2013), and cultural standpoints (Braund et al. 2007), all of which are intricately related (NRC 2005). In sum, these factors are integrated into higher-order cognitive skills essential for making rational decisions, which include multi-perspective thinking, assessment of causal relationships, moral reasoning, risk assessment, and evaluation of values.",

            "text": "Research on students\u2019 ability to engage in informal reasoning on SSIs has yielded mixed findings, reflecting the complexity of this kind of reasoning compared with that on pure scientific issues (Braund et al. 2007). On the positive side, middle school to senior secondary students were found to be able to approach SSIs from a reasonable number of perspectives in the context of nuclear energy usage, including social, economic, scientific, and ecological perspectives (e.g., Patronis et al. 1999; Wu and Tsai 2007), a clear demonstration of multi-perspective thinking. It was further found that college students used an even wider range of perspectives, including medical, ethical, economic, religious, political, and scientific perspectives, to consider the issue of stem-cell research. Middle school to college students are able to engage in value- or moral-based reasoning on a wide range of themes, including biotechnology (Zeidler and Keefer 2003; Zeidler and Sadler 2008), biological conservation (Grace 2002, 2009), wetland environmental management (Jimenez-Aleixandre and Pereiro-Mu\u00f1oz 2002), and medical research (Halverson et al. 2009). On the less positive side, middle school students were found to be fairly limited in their ability to employ multi-perspective reasoning to address environmental issues (Hogan 2002; Kortland 1996) and to integrate scientific and other information in making personal decisions (Zeidler et al. 2002). Another related concern is that scientific perspectives or science content knowledge appear to be less commonly relied upon than ethical perspectives in weighing different decision alternatives and justifying decisions on SSIs (Grooms et al. 2014; Halverson et al. 2009). Personal values were shown to play a much more important role in influencing university students\u2019 decision-making than scientific understanding (Bell and Lederman 2003). This finding led Oulton et al. (2004) to argue that students should be provided with opportunities to separate arguments from their own values and beliefs in discussing SSIs and Nielsen (2013) to conclude that decision-making about SSIs should not focus only on grounding the decision in scientific evidence but rather on how students consider a multitude of factors and their relative importance. All of these results point to the need to integrate scientific and nonscientific perspectives in SSI education without compromising the importance of either perspective.",

Various frameworks for scaffolding the decision-making process have been proposed to promote informal reasoning ability for informed decision-making. These decision-making frameworks generally involve students generating options or decision alternatives with the support of justifications based on appropriate criteria, followed by a review of the decision-making process with a view to making further improvements (e.g., Keefer 2003; Ratcliffe 1997; Tal et al. 2001; Zeidler et al. 2009). A more generic process was proposed by Svenson (1992, 1996) based on the \u201cdifferentiation and consolidation theory,\u201d which mirrors how people make decisions in more general contexts. This framework consists of three progressive phases. The first phase involves the recognition of the problem and the identification of decision alternatives. The second involves the differentiation of alternatives by either holistic differentiation or systematic process differentiation in which the pros and cons are weighed. The third stage comprises post-decision consolidation, where differentiation continues to take place to ensure that the chosen alternative is the most appropriate.",

These include the use of argumentation to promote understanding and decision-making (Patronis et al. 1999; Simon et al. 2006; Simon and Maloney 2007); the use of meta-cognitive strategies such as reflective thinking to integrate multiple perspectives (e.g., Zeidler et al. 2002); confronting students with opposing arguments through class discussions, role-plays, and debates to clarify their thoughts (Simonneaux 2001); and group discussion to enhance collaborative or peer-group decision-making (Grace 2009). However, the implementation of these strategies in the classroom is not without difficulty. Teachers may lack the skills to use argumentation, role-play, and even discussion. The effective use of such strategies also needs considerable preparation and training on the part of both teachers and students (Oulton et al. 2004). More importantly, multi-perspective reasoning and value judgment do not occur in a vacuum, which means that teachers must be able to recognize the importance of the sociocultural dimension of decision-making and to take students\u2019 sociocultural contexts into consideration in designing relevant pedagogy. Although the influences of students\u2019 experiences arising from the particular context of their decision-making are well recognized (e.g., Aikenhead and Jegede 1999; Haidt 2008; Lee 2001; Lynch 2001; Kozoll and Osborne 2004), the influence of contextual and sociocultural factors and sociocultural exchanges on decision-making about SSIs has been under explored until very recently (e.g., Lee and Grace 2012; Lee et al. 2009; Zeidler et al. 2013).",

            "text": "In this chapter, two aspects of Hong Kong students\u2019 decision-making are examined that are drawn from four independent studies. The first aspect is the way in which young people in Hong Kong address selected SSIs, their decision-making about such issues, and their reasoning behind their decisions. In some of these studies, students\u2019 decision-making was also discussed from a comparative perspective, drawing insights from evidence from cross contextual and cross-cultural comparisons that involved mainland Chinese and European students. The second aspect concerns how and to what extent different teaching strategies help to promote Hong Kong students\u2019 reasoning and decision-making about SSIs. This aspect also considers the role of sociocultural contexts in shaping students\u2019 reasoning on SSIs and how inter-contextual or intercultural exchanges can facilitate multi-perspective reasoning and decision-making, particularly about regional and global SSIs. The SSIs discussed in these four studies were related to health and animal conservation in the local, regional, or global contexts. Researchers have advocated the integration of health and environmental issues with science education to promote scientific literacy in light of the increased importance of these issues (Lee 2012; Roth 2014; Zeidler et al. 2014). All of these studies involved secondary students aged 13\u201317. In the following sections, the context of Hong Kong is briefly introduced as a background to the studies. The two aspects of decision-making about SSIs are then discussed, drawing on the findings of the four studies. Due to the different contexts of the four case studies, there are limitations in cross case comparison and hence synthesis of potential findings. Despite this, a discussion of the patterns including the unity and variations among Hong Kong students in reasoning and decision-making about SSIs across these cases will be contemplated wherever possible in order to inform future studies. This is followed by an evaluation of the impact of different teaching strategies on their reasoning and decision-making processes and outcomes. To conclude the chapter, some implications of the findings for SSI education are discussed.",

After China regained sovereignty of Hong Kong, Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) governed by a constitution set up according to the Basic Law. The Basic Law, the mini-constitution of the Hong Kong SAR, gives high autonomy to the local government, with policy making based largely on consultation and consensus (Chiu et al. 1998). Freedom of speech and of the press is honored. Hong Kong citizens are accustomed to expressing their views on social issues. Opposition to unpopular policies is often strong, fuelled by the increased pursuit by political parties and nongovernment organizations of political, economic, or environmental causes. The development of independent and critical thinking has been emphasized in recent curriculum reforms, culminating in the implementation of a new Liberal Studies curriculum at the senior secondary level that aims to help students to become independent thinkers capable of viewing issues from multiple perspectives and to acquire positive values in an interdisciplinary context (CDC and HKEAA 2007b). In terms of science education, the current trend is to integrate scientific inquiry, STSE connections, and the nature of science into the various science subjects (e.g., CDC and HKEAA 2007a).",

Although the rationale was to protect the public from the risks of passive smoking, the bill was met with strong opposition from the restaurant industry. As public opinion was divided over the issue, the issue was used to connect 15- to 16-year-old students\u2019 understanding of biological concepts with their reasoning and decision-making through a specially designed classroom discourse (Lee 2007). The classroom discourse focused first on the development of the students\u2019 conceptual understanding of smoking and passive smoking and the potential risks to bodily health through the teacher\u2019s exposition and modeling activities to show how smoke enters the breathing system and deposits tar in the lungs. The risks of smoking were substantiated by five pieces of scientific evidence presented to the students in the form of statistical data or summary statements of empirical findings. The first contained statistics about the death rate due to lung cancer and the quantity of cigarettes smoked daily that were collated by the American Cancer Society (Salber 1968). The second dataset was obtained by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (Hedley et al. 2001a) on the outcomes of passive smoking on nonsmoking catering workers in Hong Kong in terms of levels of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, in their urine. Questions were set by the teacher to guide the students\u2019 analysis and interpretation of these two datasets. Examples of the questions are: What are the possible explanations for the patterns shown by the statistics on lung cancer and the quantity of cigarettes smoked daily? How sure are you that smoking is a major cause of lung cancer? Why did nonsmoking workers working in restaurants that allowed smoking have higher cotinine levels than workers in other industries? What would you expect your urine cotinine levels to be if you ate out frequently in restaurants that allow smoking? Does the evidence available justify a ban on smoking in restaurants? (Lee 2007, p. 173).",

The students were asked to consider in small groups the arguments for and against a complete ban on smoking in restaurants before making a final decision on the issue. The students were presented with guiding questions to facilitate their decision-making, such as: What are the arguments for and against the proposed ban? To what extent are the arguments based on scientific evidence? Are you in favor of banning smoking in all restaurants? To what extent is your decision based on scientific evidence or personal values, including morals, personal rights and freedoms, and altruism? (Lee 2007, p. 174).",

However, certain patterns of students\u2019 reasoning emerge from these studies that are worthy of further investigation and have implications for SSI education in Hong Kong and perhaps elsewhere. First, although Hong Kong students\u2019 reasoning and decision-making tended to be context dependent, they were generally able to adopt reasonably wide perspectives in considering SSIs, even before going through any teaching intervention, but certain perspectives tended to dominate over others depending on the specific context of the issue. For instance, before the intervention, emotive-intuitive reasoning tended to dominate on the issue of bat intrusion, whereas the scientific/health perspective was emphasized to a greater extent than the other perspectives in the context of personal and public health, as exemplified in the studies on smoking and central slaughtering. In the \u201cbat\u201d case, the students\u2019 resorting to emotive-intuitive reasoning was probably a result of the threat they perceived or a natural fear evoked as they encountered wildlife (Hermann and Menzel 2013; Prokop and Tunnicliffe 2010). The economic perspective seemed to be manifested more prominently on the issue of whaling. These emphases suggest that Hong Kong students tend to give a higher priority to people\u2019s immediate concerns than ecological well-being or wildlife welfare. Among these concerns, personal health was accorded a higher priority particularly when health is at stake; otherwise concerns such as economic factors assume importance. These patterns reflect an anthropocentric view rather than a biocentric view. It is premature at this stage to hypothesize any cultural factor or value that underlies these views, but it seems reasonable to infer that Hong Kong students emphasize personal interests and economic development more than altruistic values which could be applied to other living beings. This kind of utilitarian value may be attributed to the highly urbanized and densely populated environment in which Hong Kong students reside, which might have distanced them from nature and wildlife. In this kind of environment, personal well-being is particularly vulnerable to contagious diseases as the history of epidemiology has indicated; hence, disease prevention is of utmost importance as publicized by the local government ever since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003. Moreover, it comes as no surprise that in a socioeconomic milieu such as Hong Kong, which lacks natural resources but is well known for its economic vibrancy, students would attach greater importance to socioeconomic well-being in evaluating different decision alternatives in SSIs.",

This weakness was clearly exhibited by the students who argued against the banning of smoking in restaurants using the commonsense justification that restaurant owners would lose business if smoking in restaurants were prohibited, despite evidence to the contrary (Lee 2007). This lack of focus on scientific data in the reasoning process was also shown in the issue of whaling. Students across cultural contexts seem to habitually engage in causal reasoning by relying on general scientific or ecological principles rather than context-specific data or evidence to evaluate different decision alternatives. These observations reaffirm the research finding that students give little consideration to the nature of science in considering decision alternatives (Bell and Lederman 2003) although science content knowledge was used in a general sense. This finding highlights the need to develop evidence-based reasoning among students, with due consideration of the nature of science, to develop their ability to reason and make decisions about controversial socioscientific issues at a more advanced level (Kolsto 2001).",

To achieve these goals, cross-cultural SSI education models based on the decision-making framework tested in these studies need to be conceptualized to provide teachers with the necessary theoretical and pedagogical frameworks to enhance students\u2019 reasoning about SSIs (Lee and Grace 2012). These models should help teachers capitalize on the benefits of cross-cultural sharing while staying alert to indiscriminate compromise or simple eclecticism and emphasizing conflict resolution based on sound principles and values as an effective strategy for problem solving.

It is an imperative to reveal the value that underpins each option so that these options can be subject to value judgment in the subsequent stage. Before making a decision as to which option is preferred, the criteria for making the choice have to be deliberated and decided upon. This entails two steps. The first one is to make judgment by consensus as to which value is more justifiable, and the second is to consider possible impacts of necessary trade-offs. For the first one, students have to address questions such as: What are the core values of society? Which value is overriding? For the second one, they need to ask: What are the impacts of the decision on society? Will the impact of the decision on particular stakeholders be so adverse as to affect their well-being?

This helps to minimize biases and develop a more complete picture of the arguments from multiple perspectives, leading to a more balanced decision. The last stage is to subject the group decision to cross-cultural sharing. Students communicate their decisions and justifications to their peers in other cultures, reconsidering their criteria for decision-making if necessary. This could be followed by further negotiation until a consensus is reached. This stage is no easy task as it may bring cultural variation in values sharply into focus. Space is limited in this paper to consider in detail the nature of values and the theories about value clarification and judgment. Suffice it to say that, as noted by Aspin (2000) , values represent generalizations of a population\u2019s inclination toward certain objects or situations, which are \u201csettled at the level of the culture of a community\u201d (Aspin 2000, p. 27). Hence, any negotiation of values invoked by socioscientific issues among cultures entails value clarification and judgment at a higher level. Moral principles may have to be drawn upon at this level of discussion. Students could argue or debate over which principles are universalistic and overriding, such as promoting sustainability in a global sense, enhancing the general welfare of mankind and other living beings, and ensuring equity for all cultures. Although the different stages in this framework are presented in a linear fashion, the process is iterative in that students may need to revisit previous stages to collect more evidence and consolidate or revise their views as their perspectives become widened, entailing progressively higher levels of critical thinking.",

SSI education should also integrate scientific and nonscientific evidence, formulate informed criteria for differentiating decision alternatives, and evaluate these criteria based on sound value judgment grounded in meta-cognitive reflection. To stimulate meta-cognitive reflection among students, alternative pedagogies for cross contextual or cross-cultural sharing need to be developed. This kind of sharing may range from an exchange of views through written communication or videotaped oral presentations to direct dialogue through videoconferencing or face-to-face discussions, as circumstances allow.",
