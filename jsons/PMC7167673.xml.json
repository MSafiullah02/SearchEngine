Nine days previously he had developed a cough, sore throat and coryzal symptoms with fever to 39\u00b0C, and 48 h into the illness he developed a widespread urticarial rash. He was initially managed at home but after 3 days without improvement was prescribed oseltamivir by a general practitioner (without virological studies, in line with current policy), however this was discontinued by his mother after three doses due to the onset of vomiting. On day 5 of the illness he developed conjunctivitis and mucositis, and began complaining of pain in his hips. He was persistently pyrexial up to 40.5\u00b0C, had decreased appetite, a limp, and was progressively irritable and distressed at home.",

Prominent pharyngitis, a red tongue, and red, dry and swollen lips were noted, along with bilateral non\u2010exudative conjunctivitis and cervical lymphadenopathy. There was a confluent macular\u2013papular rash over both hands and feet up to his elbows/knees with prominent excoriation. Hands and feet were tender and edematous, and he was unable to bend his fingers, toes or knees due to pain. No Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) scar was evident. The abdomen was soft with a tender liver edge 2 cm below the right costal margin and a palpable spleen tip. His chest was clear, heart sounds normal, and there was no evidence of neurological involvement. Urinalysis showed ketonuria (3+) with proteinuria (1+) but no cells, and a chest X\u2010ray showed minor peribronchial wall thickening bilaterally but no focal collapse or consolidation. Hip ultrasound showed bilateral small joint effusions.",

His hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dl, platelets 191 \u00d7 109/L, and clotting studies were normal. His C\u2010reactive protein was 148 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 134 mm/h, and lactate dehydrogenase 829 u/L. Sodium was 132 mEq/L, alanine transaminase 67 u/L, alkaline phosphatase 313 u/L, and albumin 24 g/L. Blood and urine cultures were negative, as was a throat swab. Polymerase chain reaction on his nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) from the time of admission was positive for influenza A H1N1/09. A presumptive diagnosis of Kawasaki disease was made, and he received i.v. immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg, and was started on aspirin at 7.5 mg/kg q.d.s. He was also started on ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg once daily and restarted on oseltamivir 45 mg twice daily once his NPA result was returned.",

He remained in hospital for five days during which he developed thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 478 \u00d7 109/L (Fig. 1). His NPA remained positive for H1N1/09 when repeated after 48 h, but was negative after a 5\u2010day course of oseltamivir. An extended polymerase chain reaction panel to detect other respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus (OC43 and 229E strains), was negative. Echocardiogram was normal on day 20 of the illness, but he remained on aspirin (at 5 mg/kg OD) until a second echo was performed 2 months later. This was also normal, along with a full set of blood results, and he was discharged from active follow up.",

Jackson and Burry described a case of influenza B that met the diagnostic criteria for KD, however there was no involvement of the extremities, a relatively short time course, and no leukocytosis or raised inflammatory markers, which are characteristic.\n6\n The discovery of plasma cells in the bronchial epithelium of KD patients producing oligoclonal immunoglobulin A directed against distinct cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in ciliated epithelial cells suggests that KD is caused by an as\u2010yet undefined virus.\n7\n The novelty of the influenza A H1N1/09 strain effectively rules it out as a candidate for the causative agent in KD. However influenza infection is potently immunomodulatory at the bronchial epithelial surface, leading to sustained desensitization to subsequent pathogen challenge and is associated with changes in bacterial colonization patterns.\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n We believe the coincident development of KD with influenza infection supports the hypothesis that KD is caused by an endemic pathogen that usually causes a mild self\u2010limiting illness indistinguishable from other viral illnesses of childhood: development of the KD syndrome is dependent on a permissive genetic and environmental host phenotype that may be facilitated by previous or concurrent infection.",
