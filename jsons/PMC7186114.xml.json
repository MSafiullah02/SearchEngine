As is known, children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are treated with long-term glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants belong to the high-risk and susceptible group of the 2019- novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, up to date, there is no case report of CKD complicated with COVID-19 in China. We here present our experience in the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection in this special group of patients, with a purpose to provide reference for the international clinical community. The general management comprises of proper rest, adequate nutrition support, and symptomatic treatment. For antiviral therapy, \u03b1 - interferon, lopinavir / ritonavir, or abidol can be used.",
