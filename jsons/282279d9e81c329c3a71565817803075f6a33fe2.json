The current Coronavirus outbreak has refocussed orthopaedic minds on managing many injuries conservatively, which would have otherwise been managed with operative fixations. It is mainly because of the restraints put on by this viral infection, limited availability of resources including personnel and operating theatre slots (whilst they were redirected to manage urgent clinical priorities including respiratory emergencies due to COVID-19 infections on the frontline) and due to reluctance of undertaking operative intervention in an atmosphere of increased risk of viral transmission, responsibility of protecting staff and 'social distancing' guidelines [4] .",

Paediatric orthopaedic trauma guidelines provide similar emphasis on managing children with non-operative strategies with an aim to minimize long-term consequences and by prioritizing conditions which need emergent operative intervention (supracondylar humerus fractures with neurovascular compromise) [",
