The 2019/20 influenza epidemic reached its peak in mid-February in France [2] and it was expected that ILI incidence would decrease thereafter. However, in the first week of March 2020, we observed a renewed increase in ILI cases in some regions. Several nasopharyngeal swabs collected in that period by Sentinelles general practitioners (GPs) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we quantified the number of consultations for ILI in France in early March 2020 in excess of what was expected to be caused by the influenza epidemic. As coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first identified in France at the end of January 2020 [3] we examined the relationship between ILI reports and reported cases of COVID-19.",

Cases of ARI include any disease with respiratory signs and are only monitored in people older than 65 years, unlike ILI. In addition, Sentinelles GPs take nasopharyngeal swabs in one ILI case and up to two ARI cases per week for viral characterisation [4] .

The correlation between the number of confirmed cases and the computed excess is also consistent with this scenario. In this case, the excess in cases is compatible with an exponential growth at an estimated rate of ca 0.7 per week. Interestingly, this estimate was very similar in the four most affected regions (GRE, IDF, OCC, HDF). It may prove useful to help calibrate models for studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Yet, the rate of excess ILI consultations applied to the French regions yielded a number of cases far in excess of confirmed cases, with 12,840 cases in IDF and around 10,000 cases in the regions GRE and HDF. Likewise, the extrapolated number of COVID-19 presenting as ARI was 760 in those older than 65 years in the two eastern regions (GRE and BFC): this was already twice the number of reported cases in these regions at the time (n = 379), all ages combined.",
