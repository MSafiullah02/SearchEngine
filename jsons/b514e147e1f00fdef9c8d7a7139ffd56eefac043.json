EPI_ISL_402119) [formally designated as SARS-CoV-2/CTan/human/2019/Wuhan (CTan-H) in this study] was isolated from a human patient (2) and SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-envF13-20/2020 (F13) (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_408514) [formally designated as SARS-CoV-2/F13/environment/2020/Wuhan(F13-E) in this study] was isolated from an environmental sample collected in Huanan seafood market, Wuhan. The two viruses differ in two nucleotides in their non-coding region: CTan-H bears 15C and 48C, whereas F13-E bears 15T and 48A. Viral stocks were prepared in Vero E6 cells with DMEM containing 2% FBS, 5 ug/ml TPCK-trypsin, and 30 mmol/L MgCl2. Viruses were harvested and the titers were determined by means of plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. qPCR To quantitate the viral RNA copies in the samples collected from the animals, viral RNA was extracted by using a QIAamp vRNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed by using the HiScript\u00ae II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). qPCR was conducted by using the Applied Biosystems\u00ae QuantStudio\u00ae 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with Premix Ex Taq\u2122 (Probe qPCR), Bulk (TaRaKa, Dalian, China). The N gene-specific primers (forward, 5'-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3'; reverse, 5'-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG-3') and probe (5'-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3') were utilized according to the information provided by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China (http://nmdc.cn/nCoV). The amount of vRNA for the target SARS-CoV-2 N gene was normalized to the standard curve obtained by using a plasmid (pBluescript\u2161SK-N, 4,221 bp) containing the full-length cDNA of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene.",

Each animal was housed in a specially designed cage inside an isolator (20, 22, 33, 34) , the schematic presentation of the isolator and cages are shown in Figure  S10 . Twenty-four hours later, a similar-aged naive cat was placed in an adjacent cage (4 cm away), separated by a double-layered net divider (fig. S10C). The ambient conditions were set at 20-22\u2103and 30%-40% relative humidity. The airflow in the isolator was horizontal with a speed of 0.1 m/s; the airflow direction was from the inoculated animals to the exposed animals. Feces were collected on days 3, 5, 7, and 9 p.i. from the subadult cats, and nasal washes were collected from the juvenile cats on days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 p.i. for viral RNA detection.

The nasal respiratory mucosa epithelium exhibited an abnormal arrangement with loss of cilia accompanied by lymphocyte infiltration into the lamina propria ( fig. S7A ). In the tonsils, the surface of the epithelium was covered with abundant neutrophils and cellular debris, and the epithelial cells showed varying degrees of degeneration and necrosis (fig. S7B ). The tracheal mucosa was covered with cellular debris and mucous material, altered polarity, degeneration, and necrosis was observed in the epithelial cells ( fig. S7C) (A) Researchers wear powered air-purifying respirators that filter the air, and disposable coveralls when they culture the virus and handle animals (ferrets and cats) that are in isolators. (B) Researchers wear full body, air-supplied, positive pressure suits when they perform studies involving the use of dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, which are kept in a room (not in isolators). (C) The transmission cages were specifically designed to allow transmission experiments to be conducted in negatively pressurized isolators (150 cm x 113 cm x 80 cm) in the ABSL4+ facility. The animals were housed in a clear solid steel cage (25 cm x 80 cm x 37 cm), which was divided into 2 small cages (25 cm x 38 cm x 37 cm) by a double-layered net divider (the neighboring cages were 4 cm apart). Twentyfour hours after the three inoculated animals were placed into the cages, three na\u00ef ve animals were placed in the adjacent cages. Negative pressure within the isolator cage was used to direct a modest (0.1m/sec) flow of HEPA-filtered air (A) from the inoculated to the na\u00ef ve animals. The outlet airflow (B) was HEPA-filtered to prevent continuous circulation of infectious influenza virus particles. Table S1 . Amino acids at SARS-CoV-2 spike-contacting positions of ACE2 protein.",
