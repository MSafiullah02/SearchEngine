Clearance can be proved with 3 negative nasal swabs for MRSA culture while off antibiotic therapy; alternatively a single nasal swab with MRSA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is effective. Although PCR testing is more expensive, it may prevent prolonged precautions and the associated adverse effects on patient experience (discussed later).14 Without an active screening process, few individuals who have cleared MRSA will be identified, and they therefore require lifelong contact precautions per most hospital policies.",

To put this into perspective, hospital waste accounts for 2% of national municipal waste, and, of that, gowns and drapes contribute approximately 2% of all hospital waste, or approximately 0.04% of all municipal waste.19 This is a small overall proportion of waste in this country; however, there may be more environmentally friendly options. With emerging technologies, reusable gowns, compared with disposable gowns, have substantial sustainability benefits with respect to the use of energy and water, and the creation of carbon footprint and waste.20\n",

Studies have shown a negative impact on patient mental well-being and behavior, as well as higher depression scores. In addition, health care workers spend less time in direct patient contact, and patient satisfaction decreased as patients perceived they were less well informed of their health care plans.21 Regarding patient safety, there was an 8-fold increase in adverse events related to supportive care when patients required the use of isolation precautions.22, 23 With these data in mind, every effort should be made to provide routine care despite the use of precautions, with the emphasis on timely discontinuation of precautions when appropriate.",
