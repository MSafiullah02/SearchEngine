Type I and III interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb) are host-produced antiviral cytokines and currently considered as COVID-19 therapy. Prolonged IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responses can lead 5 to harmful proinflammatory effects, whereas IFN-\u03bb mainly signals in epithelia, inducing localised antiviral immunity. Here we show that IFN signalling interferes with lung repair during influenza recovery, with IFN-\u03bb driving these effects most potently. IFN-induced p53 directly reduces epithelial proliferation and differentiation, increasing disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial superinfections. Hence, excessive or prolonged IFN-production aggravates viral infection 10 by impairing lung epithelial regeneration. Therefore, timing and duration are critical parameters of endogenous IFN action, and should be considered carefully for IFN therapeutic strategies against viral infections like influenza and COVID-19. 15 ",

Surfactant producing type II alveolar cells (AT2) cells 15 proliferate to reform damaged alveoli, whilst also functioning as stem cells through the differentiation into type I alveolar cells (AT1) (3, 4) . In situations of severe damage, including influenza virus-induced injury, alveolar repair is supported by the emergence and expansion of Krt5 + basal cells from the airways (5) (6) (7) (8) .",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) represent a crucial component of the innate immune defence against 20 viral infections. Type I and III IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb, respectively) are induced upon viral recognition, and function by triggering transcription of an overlapping set of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), conferring an antiviral state in infected and bystander cells (9, 10) . Owing to widespread expression of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) in immune cells, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responses can result in immunopathology during viral infections, including influenza virus and severe acute 25 respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (11) (12) (13) (14) . In contrast, the receptor for IFN-\u03bb (IFNLR) is restricted mainly to epithelia at barrier sites like the gut and lung, with expression in the immune system largely restricted to neutrophils in mice (15) (16) (17) . IFN-\u03bb responses are therefore often characterised by their ability to confer localised antiviral protection at the site of infection, without driving damaging proinflammatory responses associated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Both type I and III 30 IFNs are currently being tested in clinical trials as antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 (18) (19) (20) , despite some scepticism owing to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-associated pathogenic effects (21). In addition to their antiviral and proinflammatory activity, IFNs exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic functions, and have a long history in antitumour therapies (22) . Despite a growing understanding of the causes of immunopathology during infection with respiratory viruses, little is known 35 concerning the direct effect that IFN responses have on lung epithelial repair.",

Influenza virus matrix gene expression 5 peaked on day 2 post infection following viral replication, before viral clearance was reached on day 12 post infection ( fig. S1A ). Infection resulted in increasing morbidity and weight loss (fig. S1B), accompanied by significant immune cell infiltration and lung damage as determined by histology ( fig. S1C , left, and S1D). Recovery from infection (~day 8 post infection; fig. S1B ) coincided with the onset of epithelial regeneration ( fig. S1C, right) . To further investigate the 10 dynamics of lung repair following influenza virus infection, epithelial cells were harvested for analysis of proliferation by flow cytometry, using the marker of recent cell proliferation Ki67 (gating strategy in fig. S2 ). During steady-state conditions, type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2; EpCam + MHCII + CD49fl ow ) (3, 4, 23) have a low rate of turnover, remaining largely quiescent (Fig.  1A) . However, following influenza virus-induced lung damage, AT2 cells undergo rapid 15 proliferation starting at ~day 7 post infection, correlating with mouse recovery and weight gain of mice ( Fig. 1A and fig.

IFN subtypes (IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03bb) were produced rapidly, 20 peaking on day 2 post infection (Fig. 1B) . The magnitude of IFN-\u03bb production was significantly greater than that of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, both in concentration and duration. Whilst IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production declined following the day 2 peak, high levels of IFN-\u03bb production were maintained. Importantly, only IFN-\u03bb was detected on day 7/8 post infection, coinciding with the onset of epithelial recovery ( Fig. 1A and B) . Together, these data show that following influenza virus infection, IFN signalling 25 (in particular IFN-\u03bb induced) is ongoing throughout the onset of epithelial proliferation and lung repair. 30 Next, to understand the effect of IFNs on lung epithelial repair, mice were treated with IFN during recovery from influenza virus infection (day 7 to 10 post infection) ( fig. S3A ). To compare the effects of type I and III IFN subtypes at equal biological potency, IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03bb subtypes were titrated on murine airway epithelial cell (AEC) cultures and analysed for the induction of antiviral ISGs ( fig. S4A ). Dose-response curves were then generated to obtain an EC50 for each 35 subtype, in order to determine a conversion factor for equipotency between IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03bb ( fig.  S4B ). In order to study the effects of IFN treatment specifically on epithelial cells, we generated irradiation bone marrow (BM) chimeras where WT recipient mice were given Ifnar1 -/bone marrow cells, thus restricting IFNAR expression to the stromal compartment.",

This reduction was independent of changes in viral burden, as influenza virus matrix gene expression remained unchanged following IFN treatment ( fig. S3B) . We also observed a reduction in the proliferation of AT2 cells in WT mice following IFN-\u03bb treatment (Fig. 1B) , again independently from changes in viral load ( fig. S3C ). To exclude the possibility of IFN-\u03bb signalling in neutrophils, we treated WT mice with a monoclonal antibody against Ly6G (clone 1A8) (fig. 10 S3D). Even after depletion of neutrophils, we observed a significant reduction in AT2 cell proliferation following IFN-\u03bb treatment ( fig. S3E ). A caveat when using inbred mouse strains in the context of influenza virus infection is the lack of a functional Mx1 protein; a crucial IFNinducible influenza virus restriction factor in both mice and humans (24). We therefore infected mice that express functional Mx1 alleles (B6-Mx1) with the highly virulent influenza virus strain 15 hvPR8-DNS1, for a more clinically relevant influenza model. IFN-\u03bb treatment also significantly reduced lung epithelial proliferation in the presence of functional Mx1 (Fig. 1E) .",

Both Ifnar1 -/and 20 Ifnlr1 -/mice had improved AT2 cell proliferation, compared to WT controls ( Fig. 1F and G) . This was dependent on IFN signalling specifically through the epithelium, as receptor deficiency in the stromal compartment alone was sufficient to increase lung epithelial cell proliferation (Fig. 1H ). Improved proliferation was independent of major changes in viral burden, with only a slight increase in influenza virus matrix gene expression observed in Ifnar1 -/mice on day 2 post 25 infection, and no change in Ifnlr1 -/mice, compared to WT controls ( fig. S5A ). Viral control in individual IFN receptor knockout mice is likely unaffected due to redundancy between type I and III IFN antiviral responses in epithelial cells (25, 26).",

S5A ), the lack of redundancy in antiproliferative IFN responses, with both Ifnar1 -/and Ifnlr1 -/mice displaying enhanced 30 epithelial proliferation (Fig. 1F to H), led us to further interrogate the phenotype. As IFNAR signalling has previously been shown to be important for the production of IFN-\u03bb during influenza virus infection (27, 28), we measured IFN production in the BALF of IFN receptor knockout mice. Consistent with previous findings (28), we observed a significant reduction in IFN-\u03bb (and indeed IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) production in Ifnar1 -/mice compared to WT, yet we saw little change in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 levels 35 in Ifnlr1 -/mice ( fig. S5B ). These findings suggest that the improved epithelial proliferation observed in Ifnar1 -/mice, could be attributed to a reduction in IFN-\u03bb. Reduced IFN production in Ifnar1 -/mice is linked with steady state priming defects in these mice owing to the absence of tonic IFNAR activation in immune cells (29). To circumvent this, we used an \u03b1IFNAR monoclonal antibody during influenza virus infection (MAR1-5A3) administered only from the time of infection (day 0). \u03b1IFNAR treatment maintained steady state priming required for IFN-\u03bb 5 production ( fig. S5C ), yet was effective in reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 ( fig. S5D ) (12) . Importantly, \u03b1IFNAR treatment from day 0 or day 3 post infection, had no effect on lung epithelial cell proliferation ( fig. S5D ). We therefore conclude that in our model of influenza virus infection in B6 mice, IFN-\u03bb responses are most effective in disrupting epithelial regeneration during influenza recovery, and these effects are mediated 10 directly in epithelial cells.",

Progenitor basal cells from distal airway sites are 15 involved in the regeneration of the lung epithelium following influenza virus-induced damage (6, 8, 30) . AEC cultures undergo rapid proliferation, and also differentiation upon exposure to an airliquid interface (ALI), recapitulating repair processes observed in the lung and airway epithelium following damage in vivo (31, 32). Similar to IFNs used in vivo, IFNs used for in vitro assays were titrated on AEC cultures, to compare IFN subtypes at equivalent biological potency ( fig. S6A and 20 B). AEC cultures seeded at a low density in the presence of IFN-\u03b2 or -\u03bb were unable to reach confluence, whilst IFN-\u03b1 treatment significantly reduced AEC number and the time taken for cultures to reach confluence ( Fig. 2A left, and fig.

These findings were confirmed by measuring CFSE dilution ( fig. S7E and F, left). Interestingly, IFN-mediated antiproliferative effects were only observed in highly proliferative AEC cultures, as treating established cultures had no effect ( fig. S7E to G, right). These data suggest that IFNs actively disrupt cell cycle progression without killing 5 quiescent cells. Therefore, the increase in apoptosis observed ( fig.

Following acute damage, populations of basal cells and Scgb1a1 + secretory cells give rise to secretory and multiciliated cell subtypes (34). Timely repopulation of airway epithelial cell subsets following 10 damage is crucial in maintaining barrier function. Indeed, influenza virus infection has previously been shown to decrease mucociliary clearance in mice, resulting in an increased susceptibility to superinfection with S. pneumoniae (35). To study specific effects of IFNs on AEC differentiation, we initiated IFN treatment later during the course of AEC growth throughout exposure to an ALI, the time in which AEC differentiation is induced ( fig. S8A ). Similar to our findings for 15 proliferation, IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb treatment significantly reduced the expression of genes pertaining to multiciliated (Mcidas/Ccno) and secretory cell (Muc5AC, Scb1a1) differentiation, with IFN-\u03bb having the strongest effect (Fig. 2F) . Expression of the basal cell marker Krt5 remained unchanged, or increased by IFN-\u03bb treatment, suggesting maintenance of stemness ( fig. S8B) . We also observed a significant reduction in the number of ciliated cells in AEC cultures (acetylated \u03b1-tubulin + ) 20 following IFN-\u03bb treatment, but not with IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2 ( Fig. 2G and fig. S8C ). To confirm these findings in vivo, WT and Ifnlr1 -/mice were infected with influenza virus, and lung sections were analysed by immunofluorescence. Ifnlr1 -/mice had increased acetylated \u03b1-tubulin + ciliated cells in repairing conducting airways on day 10 post infection ( Fig. 2H ). We quantified these findings by flow cytometry, and observed an increase in the frequency of differentiated AECs 25 (EpCam high CD49f high CD24 + ) composed of ciliated, goblet and club cells ( Fig. 2I and fig. S2 ) (5) . From these results, we conclude that IFN-\u03bb signalling reduces the capacity for basal cell differentiation during recovery from influenza virus infection. 30 To understand mechanistically how IFNs mediate antiproliferative effects, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on IFN-treated AEC cultures (Fig. 3A) . Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that untreated AEC control samples clustered depending on length of culture growth (including ALI exposure) along the principal component 2 (PC2), indicating that this axis represents proliferation and differentiation (Fig. 3B ). AECs treated with IFN subtypes for 35 4 hours of culture clustered away from their respective mock on PC1, suggesting this principal 8 component of variance (46%) is attributable to induction of antiviral ISGs (Fig. 3B) . Additionally, 4-hour IFN treatment clustered samples together regardless of subtype (Fig. 3B) , confirming the equal subtype dosage based on previous titrations ( fig. S6A , B, and S9A).",

Conversely, the response induced by IFN-\u03b1 was significantly reduced after just 2 days of treatment, consistent with previous findings (36) . Ingenuity pathway 10 analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes following prolonged IFN treatment (2, 3 and 5 days) revealed the top cluster pertaining to biological pathways regulating cell cycle and cell death, most significantly induced by IFN-\u03bb treatment across all timepoints (Fig. 3C ). Predicted upstream transcriptional regulators identified typical regulators of IFN function, including interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, in 15 addition to regulators of cell cycle (Fig. 3D) . We identified the tumour suppressor protein p53 as a top candidate regulating IFN-inducible antiproliferative effects, owing to its significant predicted activity following prolonged IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb treatment in AECs (Fig. 3D) . Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed IFN-mediated induction of the p53 downstream pathway and p53-regulated downstream targets ( fig. S9B and C) . 20 To confirm the role of p53, we utilised p53 -/-AEC cultures. IFN treatment had no effect on p53 -/-AEC number or proliferation following IFN treatment ( Fig. 3E and F) . IFN-mediated induction of antiproliferative downstream p53 target genes Gadd45g and Dusp5 (37, 38) was p53 dependent, as IFNs had no such effect in p53 -/-AEC cultures (Fig. 3G) . Additionally, IFN-\u03bb had a much-reduced negative effect on multiciliogenesis in differentiating p53 -/cultures, compared to 25 its effect on WT and p53 +/cultures ( fig. S9D ). We next sought to examine whether IFNs regulate p53 activity in epithelial cells during lung repair in vivo. To study IFN effects specifically in the lung epithelium, we once again generated Ifnar1 -/-> WT bone marrow chimeric mice for IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2 treatment, or depleted neutrophils in WT mice with \u03b1Ly6G for IFN-\u03bb treatment ( fig. S3A ). In agreement with in vitro observations, IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb, but not IFN-\u03b1, significantly upregulated p53 30 expression in repairing lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3H and I) . Taken together, these results demonstrate that IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb mediate antiproliferative effects in AECs via induction of p53. Additionally, our RNA-seq analyses confirm the potent antiproliferative activity of IFN-\u03bb, compared to type I IFN subtypes.",

We therefore determined whether this alters the state of lung epithelia or affects barrier function of the respiratory epithelium. RNA-5 seq analysis of sorted influenza virus infected lung epithelial cells (EpCam + CD31 -CD45 -) from WT or Ifnlr1 -/mice confirmed an upregulation of pathways pertaining to proliferation and multiciliogenesis in Ifnlr1 -/mice (Fig. 4A) . Improved repair correlated with reduced lung damage, with a reduction in both the total, and red blood cell number in the BALF of Ifnlr1 -/mice day 8 post infection ( Fig. 4B and C) . Additionally, Ifnlr1 -/mice had less inflammatory immune cell 10 infiltrate dispersed in lung tissues (Fig. 4D) . Influenza virus infections in humans are often exacerbated by opportunistic bacterial pathogen, including S. pneumoniae (39) . A contributing factor driving this synergy, is a compromised epithelial barrier as a result of influenza virusinduced damage. To measure the effects of IFN-\u03bb signalling on lung barrier function, we challenged mice with S. pneumoniae 8 days post influenza virus infection. We used BM chimeric 15 mice to study specific effects of IFN-\u03bb in epithelial cells. Mice lacking IFNLR in the stromal compartment (WT > Ifnlr1 -/-) had improved survival following bacterial superinfection (Fig. 4E) .",

Specific blockade of type I IFN responses with \u03b1IFNAR-treatment had no effect on lung epithelial proliferation. Comparison of IFN subtypes at equal biological potency in AECs revealed IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb to most significantly disrupt growth and induce antiproliferative pathways in primary 30 human and murine epithelial cell cultures. Factors that determine the antiproliferative differential of IFN subtypes include: ligand-receptor binding affinity, length of stimulation, receptor density, and negative feedback control (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . Additionally, we found the magnitude of IFN-\u03bb production in BALF was greater compared to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, extending into the crucial time window in which epithelial repair manifests post influenza virus infection. We therefore conclude that the reduced 35 antiproliferative potential of IFN-\u03b1, combined with low IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 levels in vivo, limits the capacity for type I IFNs to block lung repair directly in B6 mice. However, we do not exclude a potential for host IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in directly blocking lung epithelial repair. This may be the case in situations of excessive type I IFN production and lung pathology, as seen in other mouse strains following influenza virus or SARS-CoV infection (12, 13) .",

Research defining the mechanisms by which IFNs induce growth inhibitory effects have focused on type I IFNs, using transformed cell lines to explore antitumour therapeutics, with little understanding for their roles in normal physiology or during infection (22). In primary AECs, we observed no difference between WT and p53 -/cultures in baseline growth or expression of downstream effector genes (including Gadd45g and Dusp5), 10 indicating that p53 is inactive in these cells under normal conditions. Once activated, p53 triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through induction of its target genes (46), and has previously been shown to directly regulate IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 antitumour and antiviral responses (47). We also show that IFN-\u03bb disrupts AEC differentiation during lung repair. The differentiation of AEC cultures triggered by air exposure is accompanied by reduced cell 15 proliferation. As we treated cultures specifically during this period, the block in differentiation appears to be independent of antiproliferative IFN effects. Multiciliogenesis in AECs requires tightly coordinated use of the mitotic machinery for centriole amplification, required for the generation of cilia (48) . We therefore speculate that IFN-induced p53 activity disrupts this coordination, thereby impairing AEC differentiation. Respiratory virus infections are associated 20 with chronic lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (49) , and proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to induce epithelial remodelling in human AECs (50) . Therefore, our data suggest a mechanistic link between antiviral immune responses and longterm changes in lung physiology.",

However, macaques infected with the highly virulent 1918 H1N1 strain, revealed an elevated ISG signature late during infection bronchial tissue (65). Additionally, SARS-CoV patients displayed robust IFN responses, and aberrant ISG 5 expression in severe cases (66) . Whether susceptible individuals display excessive IFN responses late during infection, and the potential impact this has on lung repair, remains to be determined. Our transcriptomic analyses of regenerating epithelial cells in vivo link host IFN-\u03bb responses with a reduction in the capacity for lung repair. Analysis of lung tissue and BALF from respiratory virus infected patients experiencing severe disease will provide insight into the mechanisms regulating 10 disease pathogenesis, including potential interplay between IFNs and epithelial cells.",

Our data highlights the importance of a well-timed IFN response, with regards to both host immunity and exogenous treatment. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 treatment 15 exacerbates inflammation and disease severity in mice if administered past the peak of viral replication during influenza virus or Middle East respiratory-syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) infection (67, 68) . IFN-\u03bb treatment early during influenza virus infection was shown to be protective, owing to its ability to confer antiviral protection without generating the proinflammatory responses associated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (68, 69) . For these reasons, IFN-\u03bb is therefore 20 being implemented as a candidate therapy for COVID-19 (70) . However, our findings here identify a mechanism by which IFN-\u03bb exacerbates respiratory virus disease acting specifically through the respiratory epithelium, independent of immunomodulation.",

Type I and III IFNs reduce epithelial cell proliferation during lung repair. (A and B) Mice were infected with 10 4 TCID50 X31 (H3N2) influenza virus in 30 \u00b5l intranasally. (A) Proliferating (Ki67 + ) AT2 cells (EpCam + MHCII + CD49f low ) were measured by flow cytometry (n 5 = 5), and (B) type I and III IFN levels were detected in BALF (n = 4), on indicated days post infection. (C and D) X31 infected mice were administered IFNs every 24 hours (on days 7 to 10 post infection), and proliferating (Ki67 + ) AT2 cells (EpCam + MHCII + CD49f low ) were measured by flow cytometry on day 11 post infection. (C) Lethally irradiated WT mice were injected with Ifnar1 -/bone marrow cells. Following reconstitution, influenza virus-infected chimeric mice were 10 treated with PBS control (n = 8), IFN-\u03b1 (n = 9), or IFN-\u03b2 (n = 9). Na\u00efve controls are uninfected, untreated bone marrow chimeric mice (n = 2). (D) Infected WT mice were treated with IFN-\u03bb (n = 4) or PBS control (n = 4). Na\u00efve controls are uninfected, untreated WT mice (n = 5). (E) B6-Mx1 mice were infected with 2.5 x 10 3 TCID50 hvPR8-DNS1 (H1N1) and treated with IFN-\u03bb (n = 4) or PBS control (n = 4) (IFN treatment and lung analysis was performed as for C and D). (F to 15 H) Lungs from X31 infected WT (n = 4 to 7), (F) Ifnar1 -/-(n = 4), (G) Ifnlr1 -/-(n = 7), and (H) BM chimeric mice (n = 4 to 5) mice were harvested and proliferating (Ki67 + ) AT2 cells were measured by flow cytometry on day 8 post infection.
