            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was a novel contagious infectious disease that first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong province, China. It spread rapidly, infecting thousands of people in 30 countries across five continents, and resulted in hundreds of fatalities. The high infectivity, morbidity and mortality created panic around the world. The evidence suggests that SARS-CoV was transmitted primarily by droplets and by direct contact.1, 2, 3 Working at the frontline in the battle against a previously unknown lethal pathogen, healthcare workers (HCWs) were victims of the SARS catastrophe from nosocomial infection.4, 5, 6, 7, 8 The procedure of emergency resuscitation, such as endotracheal intubation or airway management, can stimulate coughing and often necessitates open suctioning of respiratory secretions. These close-contact procedures put resuscitators at high risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV. Frontline HCWs who directly participated in endotracheal intubation had an increased risk of subsequently developing SARS.9 For the purposes of providing adequate infection control procedures to protect staff, several infection control measures (ICMs) were implemented in our hospital.",

After the first SARS case was admitted to this hospital, strict ICMs were implemented and enforced. However, the implementation of ICMs was a great challenge, especially in emergency resuscitation. HCWs had to spend extra time preparing for resuscitation procedures and, even with prior training, the additional protective measures made it harder to perform emergency resuscitation. Several ICMs limited the capacity of HCWs to provide emergency care. Furthermore, the increasing number of cumulative probable cases of SARS reported in the news media and in government announcements was a cause of great stress among HCWs during emergency resuscitation.",

Non-trauma patients who received emergency resuscitation from January 1 to April 2 (total, 92 days) or from April 3 to June 3 (total, 92 days) were classified into two groups: before (period 1), and during (period 2), strict implementation of ICMs. In period 1, protection during emergency resuscitation consisted of surgical mask and gloves. Immediately following confirmation of the first SARS case in our hospital (period 2), strict ICMs were implemented and the personal protection equipment (PPE) during emergency resuscitation was upgraded to an N95 respirator and/or surgical mask, gloves, gown and goggles as well as rapid sequence intubation if indicated. ICMs before and during resuscitation of suspected SARS patients included the standard operating procedures of wearing gloves and gown, in addition to use of airway and breathing equipment, intubation and ventilator. Other strict hospital ICMs in period 2 included the following: (i) all new admissions were required to be examined by our emergency department's SARS screening team; (ii) all febrile patients were required to be admitted to the fever screening ward regardless of their diagnoses; (iii) unnecessary contact between HCWs was restricted and regular meetings and conferences were cancelled; (iv) each step of the standard operating procedure was strictly audited during resuscitation.",

The result of resuscitation was classified into \u2018failure\u2019 and \u2018having response\u2019. \u2018Having response\u2019 indicated that the patient's condition was persistently stable more than 6 h after emergency resuscitation.
