In a 52-year old patient who had kidney transplantation 12 years earlier and a confirmed Covid-19, successful recovery was achieved following reduction of immunosuppressant therapy coupled with low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy (3). In two heart transplant recipients, both recovered after supportive therapy with antibiotics and antiviral therapy coupled to reduction of immunosuppressive therapy (4) . From these first very early experiences with Covid-19 in renal, heart and lung transplant recipients, disease presentation seemed to be similar as in the general population. Whether Covid-19 is more severe or probably mitigated due to the effects of the immunosuppression on virus replication in patient after solid organ transplantation is still unknown but recovery was so far possible in most reported cases, although some anecdotal unpublished reports from Italy suggest a higher morbidity in older transplant recipients. Based on this experience a higher clinical suspicion is warranted and early testing is recommended, since COVID-19 can be present even in relatively asymptomatic patients after lung transplantation.
