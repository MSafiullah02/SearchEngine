            "text": "Porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD), commonly known as porcine circovirus disease (PCVD) in Europe, is arguably the most economically significant disease facing the global swine industry today. This disease has devastated every major swine producing country in the world and has culminated in losses of up to twenty dollars per pig in the United States swine population (Gillespie et al., 2009). While PCVAD encompasses a spectrum of clinical syndromes, all are unified by the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) as the primary causative agent. PCV2 is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded, circular DNA virus belonging to the family Circoviridae (Todd et al., 2005). PCVAD requires the presence of PCV2, but PCV2 infection alone rarely produces the full spectrum or severity of clinical disease. Other co-infecting pathogens, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine parvovirus, swine influenza virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) augment the severity of clinical disease and result in increased PCV2 viral load in infected pigs (Opriessnig and Halbur, 2012). The exact mechanisms by which viral or bacterial co-infection with PCV2 potentiates clinical PCVAD are unknown, but modulation of the host immune system is likely a key event in the pathogenesis of this disease (Gillespie et al., 2009, Krakowka et al., 2001).",

Tregs are broadly divided into natural Tregs, originating from the thymus, and inducible (adaptive) Tregs, derived outside the thymus from na\u00efve CD4+ T cells (Askenasy et al., 2008). Although the phenotype of Tregs is variable, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells exhibiting suppressor activity by a variety of mechanisms have been identified in pigs (Kaser et al., 2008a, Kaser et al., 2008b, Kaser et al., 2011). By altering the host immune response to viral infection, Tregs contribute to persistent infection of many viruses including Friend virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Belkaid, 2007, Li et al., 2008, Rouse et al., 2006).",

PRRSV-mediated Treg induction appears to vary depending on the virus genotype (Silva-Campa et al., 2010). Since co-infection with PCV2 and PRRSV is very common in the swine population, and since pigs co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV have reduced IFN-\u03b3 and increased IL-10 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Shi et al., 2010), we hypothesize that co-infection should induce higher numbers of Tregs\nin vitro.",

Porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) were generated as previously described for pig 1 (Wang et al., 2007). Briefly, CD14-positive monocytes were purified from PBMCs by immunomagnetic labeling of cells using mouse anti-swine CD14 monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and goat-anti-mouse IgG microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The CD14-positive monocytes were cultured for 5 days in complete medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant porcine IL-4 and 20 ng/ml recombinant porcine GM-CSF (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA). Due to low DC yields by this method, an alternative technique for generating DCs was employed for pigs 2\u20135 as previously reported (Carrasco et al., 2001, Flores-Mendoza et al., 2008). Freshly isolated PBMCs were seeded in T75 tissue culture flasks and incubated overnight in complete medium at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 to allow monocytes to adhere. Non-adherent cells were removed and frozen in fetal bovine serum containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Adherent cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in complete medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant porcine IL-4 and 20 ng/ml recombinant porcine GM-CSF. After 5 days, DCs were harvested using Cellstripper\u2122, an enzyme-free cell dissociation medium (Cellgro, Manassas, VA). DC differentiation from both methods was confirmed by typical veiled morphology and phenotyping with monoclonal antibodies specific for MHC I, MHC II, CD 172 (SWC3), CD 14, and CD 1 (Wang et al., 2007).",

In addition, co-infection with PCV2 and PRRSV is one of the major contributors to development of clinical PCVAD (Opriessnig et al., 2007). However, the specific means by which PRRSV/PCV2 co-infection modulates the immune response in PCVAD is currently unknown. One potential mechanism is virus-mediated induction of Tregs. It has been reported that pigs co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV have more severe lymphoid depletion and enhanced PCV2 replication and tissue distribution (Allan and Ellis, 2000, Harms et al., 2001, Rovira et al., 2002). While protective immunity against PCV2 is associated with neutralizing antibody and IFN-\u03b3 production (Meerts et al., 2005), Tregs decrease the IFN-\u03b3 response, block migration and proliferation of effector T cells, and inhibit IL-2 production (Askenasy et al., 2008). Therefore, PCV2/PRRSV-mediated activation of Tregs, as demonstrated in this study, may dampen the immune responses to PCV2, resulting in increased viral replication and clinical disease. In support of this model, PRRSV/PCV2 co-infection has been shown to upregulate IL-10 expression while suppressing IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12p40 and IFN-\u03b3 (Shi et al., 2010).",

However, a highly virulent PRRSV strain did not induce IL-10 in vitro or in vivo, and there is evidence that the ability of PRRSV to induce IL-10 varies depending on the strain (Darwich et al., 2011, Gimeno et al., 2011, Subramaniam et al., 2011). There are conflicting data in the literature regarding the relationship between PRRSV-mediated IL-10 production and Treg induction. In one study PRRSV mediated induction of Tregs was shown to be dependent on TGF-\u03b2, but not IL-10 (Silva-Campa et al., 2009). However, in a more recent study DCs pulsed with PRRSV N protein induced IL-10 producing cells and Tregs, suggesting a correlation between IL-10 production and development of PRRSV-induced Tregs (Wongyanin et al., 2012). In the present study co-infection of DCs with PCV2 and PRRSV was associated with an up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 compared to infection with either virus alone, but no increase in IL-10 was seen following infection with either virus alone or co-infection with both viruses compared to uninfected controls. These results are similar to previous reports of PRRSV-mediated Treg induction (Silva-Campa et al., 2009). Because cytokine levels were quantified in the cell culture supernatant, the increase in TGF-\u03b2 could reflect production by DCs or T lymphocytes. Individual pig TGF-\u03b2 levels in the PRRSV/PCV2 co-infected groups did not directly correlate with the magnitude of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg induction in (data not shown), which further suggests that TGF-\u03b2 production is not solely attributable to Tregs. In addition, DCs were not treated with LPS or an unrelated virus (i.e. influenza virus or transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus). Therefore, it is uncertain whether the observed increase in Tregs occurs in a virus-specific manner or reflects a more general homeostatic response to inflammation.",

In the present study, there was considerable individual variation among pigs in the Treg response to infection with PRRSV, PCV2, or both viruses, even though the same genotype II North American PRRSV and PCV2a strains were used in all replicates. This may be due in part to genetic variation among pigs contributing to relative resistance or susceptibility of the host immune response, as has been described for PRRSV infection (Lunney and Chen, 2010). Although the results from this study suggest that Treg induction may play a role in modulating the immune response to co-infection with PCV2 and PRRSV in vitro, additional studies investigating the Treg response to PRRSV/PCV2 co-infection in vivo are needed to address the biological significance of virus-mediated Treg induction in the pathogenesis of PCVAD.",
