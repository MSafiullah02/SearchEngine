Ingestion of infective oocysts excreted in the faeces of infected animals is followed by replication of the parasite in parasitophorous vacuoles within intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in diarrhoea and other signs of gastrointestinal disease. Cryptosporidiosis in dairy calves usually occurs in the first few weeks of life and, in most cases, is a self-limiting disease (O\u2019Handley et al., 1999). However, the condition may represent a significant problem on farms where the prevalence of infection is high, with losses due to increased treatment costs and, occasionally, mortality (de Graaf et al., 1999). C. parvum in calves is also of zoonotic importance, with infections in people acquired either by direct contact with infected animals or by the ingestion of oocysts in contaminated water or food (Peng et al., 1997, McLauchlin et al., 2000).",

            "text": "\nC. parvum infection in calves may be diagnosed by several methods. At post-mortem, infection can be detected by histological examination of sections of the intestine. However, most diagnostic methods rely on the detection of oocysts in faeces by microscopy, with or without prior concentration of oocysts in the specimen. Such methods are less invasive, and enable ante mortem diagnosis of infection. Microscopy may be performed using stained or unstained preparations. Staining methods are most commonly used, and include acid-fast reagents, such as Ziehl-Neelsen, non-specific fluorescent stains, such as auramine-rhodamine, and immunofluorescent stains (Casemore et al., 1985, Qu\u00edlez et al., 1996). These stains may be combined with concentration methods in order to improve the detection limit of the techniques. However, techniques using stains tend to be more time consuming than non-staining methods, and, where fluorescent reagents are used, require expensive equipment. Non-staining methods usually include concentration of the oocysts in the specimen before microscopic examination. This is most commonly achieved by the addition of an aqueous solution of sucrose to the sample (Abassi et al., 2000), most often followed by centrifugation (Sheather, 1922). Such techniques are simpler and cheaper to perform than methods employing stains.",

This is especially important where low numbers of oocysts are being excreted by an animal. Sheather's solution (Sheather, 1922), an aqueous solution of sugar, is often used, either in its original form or as a modified version, to concentrate oocysts in faecal samples using centrifugation. However, the use of concentration methods increases the time required for sample preparation. Furthermore, as dairy calves usually excrete large numbers of oocysts (Nydam et al., 2001), microscopy without previous concentration may be adequately sensitive for routine diagnostic use.",

This technique produces a gel electrophoresis banding pattern specific to C. parvum (Sulaiman et al., 1999, Pedraza-D\u00edaz et al., 2001). It has a lower limit of detection of \u22640.05 oocyst per PCR reaction, and was used in this study as a gold standard for evaluation of the microscopy and lateral immunochromatography tests. In addition to test accuracy, several other criteria are usually considered of importance by researchers and practitioners when contemplating the choice of available diagnostic methods. The utility of each test was therefore also assessed in terms of cost, ease of use, time required for sample preparation and reading, and ease of batching.",

            "text": "For microscopic examination of faecal samples, a modified Sheather's solution (specific gravity 1.32) was prepared by dissolving 2 kg of sugar in 1000 ml of tap water using gentle heat. To prepare slides for examination, 3 ml of the sugar solution was added to 1 g of faeces. The mixture was homogenised using an applicator stick. One drop of the suspension was then immediately placed on a clean microscope slide and covered with a 22 mm \u00d7 22 mm coverslip, using gentle pressure so that the mixture filled the entire area beneath the coverslip. Slides were examined for the presence of C. parvum oocysts under bright field microscopy at \u00d7400 magnification using an optical microscope (Leica, Opti-Tech Scientific, Scarborough, Ont., Canada), and were read within 30 min of preparation. Oocysts were identified as spherical, pink, refractile structures 3\u20136 \u03bcm in diameter situated just beneath the coverslip. A single slide was prepared and examined for each faecal sample, and the sample was considered positive for C. parvum if at least one oocyst was detected. This method allowed for the estimation of the number of oocysts per gram of faeces by multiplying the average number of oocysts per \u00d7400 microscope field by an appropriate factor. As there were 2304 fields per coverslip area, which covered approximately 0.04 g of faecal preparation, and the total weight of the preparation (1 g faeces and 3 ml sucrose) was approximately 5 g, the factor used in this study was 2.9 \u00d7 105 (=2304 \u00d7 [5/0.04]).",

            "text": "In 8 of the 10 cases where the results of the sucrose wet mount test were recorded as false negatives, the calves tested positive by microscopy 1 week after collection of the negative sample. At the time of collection of the first sample, these calves may have been in the early stages of infection, with levels of oocyst shedding that were below the limit of detection of the microscopy test. On the other hand, the five false positive results reported here may have been due to the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts similar to those of C. parvum that cannot be detected by COWP PCR\u2013RFLP (Xiao et al., 2000), or structures of a similar size and refractile appearance as C. parvum oocysts. Cryptosporidium muris is the only other species of Cryptosporidium known to infect cattle. The oocysts of this species are larger than those of C. parvum, and are usually found only in cattle older than those sampled in this study (de Graaf et al., 1999). Furthermore, COWP PCR\u2013RFLP would be expected to amplify DNA of C. muris (Sulaiman et al., 1999, Xiao et al., 2000). A few genotypes of C. parvum are not readily detectable using COWP-based genotyping techniques (Xiao et al., 2000); however, such genotypes are not commonly found in young calves. It is therefore more likely that the structures detected in the false positive samples were non-Cryptosporidium structures.",
