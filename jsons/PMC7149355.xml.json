Vaccines can be used more widely, especially in developing countries, if their cost of production can be reduced and they can be preserved without refrigeration. In developing countries certain limitations, like vaccine affordability, the need for \u201ccold chains\u201d from the producer to the site of use of the vaccine, and the dependence on injection, are barriers to health care services. Plant-derived vaccines do not face such limitations. Research under way is dedicated to solving these limitations by finding ways to produce oral (edible) vaccines from transgenic plants. Plant-derived vaccines offer increased safety, envisage low-cost programs for mass vaccination, and propose a wider use of vaccination for veterinary use [1].\n",

These vaccines are comprised of proteins derived from pathogenic viruses, bacteria, or parasites (generally proteins are produced not by the pathogens themselves, but by expression of the gene encoding the protein in a \u201csurrogate organism\u201d) [2]. In the last decade, it was found that green plants can also be used as the \u201csurrogate production organism\u201d to produce antigens of human pathogens (including HBsAg). These proteins can elicit priming and also can boost the immune response in humans when administered orally. In addition, unlike almost all other cell lines used for production of vaccines, components of plant cells have always been an important part of the normal human diet. Plants, therefore, offer significant new opportunities for making safe and effective oral vaccines [3].",

This process is known as transformation and altered plants are called transgenic plants. Selection of important epitope region(s) from the pathogen of interest is the one of the key factors that determines the success of potential edible vaccines. Edible vaccine development has been challenged by low expression levels of foreign proteins in transgenic plants. Reported expression rates range from 0.01% to 2% total soluble protein (TSP), which can render edible vaccine proteins less immunogenic. Selection of strong plant-specific super promoters to improve expression levels is another key factor that can determine the success of edible vaccines [4].",

The techniques used to introduce foreign genes into plants have been extended to major crops, vegetables, and ornamental and medicinal plants. Various foreign proteins including serum albumin, human \u03b1-interferon, human erythroprotein, and murine IgG and IgA immunoglobulins have been successfully expressed in plants. In recent years, several attempts have been made to produce various antigens and antibodies in plants. Antigens or antibodies expressed in plants can be administered orally as any edible part of the plant, or by the parenteral route (such as intramuscular or intravenous injection) after isolation and purification from the plant tissue. The edible part of the plant to be used as a vaccine is fed raw to experimental animals or humans to prevent possible denaturation during cooking, and avoid cumbersome purification protocols [5].",

Other strategies for expression of foreign genes in plants include use of strong and organ-specific plant promoters, targeting of the protein into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by incorporating ER-targeting and ER-retention signals, creation of an optimized translation start site context, as well as alteration of codons to suit the expression of prokaryotic genes in a plant. For the production of edible vaccines or antibodies, it is desirable to select a plant whose products can be consumed raw to avoid degradation during cooking. Thus, plants like tomato, banana, and cucumber are generally the plants of choice. While expression of a gene into the genome allows maintenance of the material in the form of seeds, some virus-based vectors can also be used to express the gene transiently to develop the products in a short period (Fig. 9.1\n). This may have the additional advantage of allowing expression of the product at a very high level; not always attainable in transgenic systems [6].\n",

            "text": "Plus-sense, single-stranded plant RNA viruses have been proposed as an effective alternative to produce vaccine antigens in plants. In this technique, the epitope of interest is engineered into a plant virus, usually within the coat protein gene. Infection of a susceptible non-GM-plant results in intracellular production and accumulation of the epitope. The epitope sequence, as well as the viral genome, never become integrated into the plant genome and hence are only expressed by the generation of infected cells. A recombinant cowpea mosaic virus has shown to elicit protective immunity in mink when engineered to express the antigenic epitope against mink enteritis virus. Recombinant alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) has enabled expression of significant quantities of rabies virus and HIV epitopes upon integration of their respective coding sequence into the AlMV coat protein. The extra sequences were found to protrude from the virion surface without interfering with virus assembly. Recombinant AlMV coat protein molecules have also demonstrated the ability to assemble into particles containing three different epitopes from HIV and rabies. This demonstrates the ability of plant viruses to produce multicomponent vaccines [7]. Claimed advantages of transient viral expression of transgenes over transgenic plants are: lesser time for cloning of the foreign gene in the viral genome as compared to time required for transformation of plants; the ease at which antigen production can be scaled up; and the wide host range of plant viruses, which allows use of multiple plant species as biofactories.",

The mucosal immune system is the first line of defense and the most effective site for vaccination against pathogens. Nasal and oral vaccines are most effective for mucosal infections. The goal of oral vaccine is to stimulate both mucosal and humoral immunity against pathogens. Edible vaccines when taken orally undergo mastication, and degradation of plant cells occurs in the intestine due to the action of digestive enzymes. Peyer\u2019s patches are an enriched source of IgA producing plasma cells and have the potential to populate mucosal tissue and serve as mucosal immune effector site. The breakdown of edible vaccine occurs near Peyer\u2019s patches, which consist of 30\u201340 lymphoid nodules on the outer surface of the intestine and also contain follicles from which the germinal center develops after antigenic stimulation. These follicles act as a site for the penetration of antigens in intestinal epithelium. The antigen then comes in contact with M-cells. M-cells express class-2 major histocompatibility complex molecules, and antigens transported across the mucous membranes by M-cells can activate B-cells within these lymphoid follicles. The activated B-cells leave the lymphoid follicles and migrate to diffuse mucosal associated lymphoid tissue where they differentiate into plasma cells that secrete the IgA class of antibodies. These IgA antibodies are transported across the epithelial cells into secretions of the lumen where they can interact with antigens present in the lumen (Figure 9.2\n).",

Furthermore, plant DNA is not known to interact with animal DNA and plant viral recombinants does not invade mammalian cells. Further safety of plant-derived vaccines can be achieved by following similar regulations established for traditional vaccines. Nevertheless, the present concern over the use of GM plants is now affecting research in this important field, especially in Europe. One of the fears is that GM pollen may outcross with sexually compatible plants (related crops or weeds) and affect biodiversity. In order to address this alarm, several pollen containment approaches have been developed. These are essentially based on the exploitation of different forms of male sterility (suicide genes, infertility barriers, apomixis). An alternative way of solving the problem is engineering vaccines into the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), which is not transmitted to the sexual progeny through the pollen grains. An additional safety feature would be the recognition of GM plants that produce vaccines by the addition of genes encoding colored plant pigments. It is important to recognize that plants that produce vaccines are medicinal plants and should be grown, processed, and regulated as pharmaceutical products. In the majority of earlier papers, level of antigen accumulation in the plant organ was in the order of 0.1\u20130.4% of total soluble protein, while the more recent developments on cpDNA integration promises to increase this value to 30% or more. At the latter value, land requirements for industrial plant-derived vaccine production will be in the order of a few thousand square meters. This will definitely enable vaccine-producing plants to be set apart from field grown crop plants and offer added safety when engineered plant viruses are used for transient antigen expression. A further point of public concern in GM plants is the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (used as selective marker in most transgenic plants). Approaches have now been developed to generate GM plants (with both nuclear or cpDNA integration) that do not carry these genes.",
