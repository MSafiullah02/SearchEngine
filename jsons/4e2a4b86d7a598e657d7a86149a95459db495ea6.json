Methods: We did a cross-sectional point prevalence survey, which was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We included a pre-determined number of centers based on each country population: five to ten EDs for countries with > 20 million inhabitants and one to five EDs for the other countries. ED directors or named delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice in use one month after the outbreak in Northern Italy. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data. Results: Overall 102 centers from 18 countries completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items. COVID-19 positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms. Conclusion: We identified variability and gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. Early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as key factors that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.",

The participating centers represent a subset of EDs caring for children in Europe and include referral centers for children, thus our findings may not be generalisable across different settings. Although some countries exceeded the expected number of recruited centers, we were able to obtain a reasonable balance in terms of country representativeness. In addition, the objective of this survey was to explore common challenges and generalizable learning points and not to compare responses between countries.",

This may ensure a more rapid response in terms of implementation of infection prevention and control measures within healthcare in those countries that lag behind the spread wave. This is important at all levels of care within an integrated health care system, but it is paramount for frontline services such as EDs. 18 Implementation of appropriate PPE use can be easily done and should occur in a timely manner. This is in contrast to barriers related to structural limitations and constraints affecting the organization of ED patient flow and isolation capacity, which may be difficult to overcome in a short time frame. Infection control measures were more consistently reported in the survey, including re-arrangement of ED patient flow, changing of staff work shift to optimize resource utilization, reduction in the number of care givers allowed with the child and home quarantine for confirmed COVID-19 pediatric cases fit for discharge.",

            "text": "Province in China in December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across the world.1 The epidemic in Europe initially centerd around Northern Italy where there was a steep rise in the number of cases and case fatalities from February 20th onwards.2 While European countries were deciding upon or were enacting containment measures of varying degrees, the infection continued to spread across the continent with devastating impact on health systems, the economy and the society at large. It is now more crucial than ever before that the emergency department (ED), as the entry point to hospital care, is prepared to manage high risk patients in an efficient and safe way, from triage to final disposition. The ED should respond to the epidemic surge in agreement with hospital contingency plans and guidelines from local and national health authorities,3 also drawing on the experience of other countries.4 With the pandemic unfolding throughout Europe, pediatric emergency physicians liaised through their European Society -The European Society of Emergency Medicine (EuSEM) Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) Section, and European Pediatric Emergency Medicine research networks -Research in European Padiatric Emergency Medicine (REPEM) and Pediatric Emergency Research United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI), to share experiences and resources.11-13 This dialogue highlighted the differences and challenges of ED preparedness, surge capacity and management of pediatric suspected/confirmed COVID-19",

Containment measures enforced in participating countries as of March 20th were highly variable and their number was not associated with the infection spread (Table 1S; Figure 1S -Supplementary material). Measures less often taken were the most restrictive, namely the closure of nonessential commercial activities (67%); the closure of land borders (50%) and the prohibition of any travel not-related to health or food shopping needs (50%). A summary of criteria for suspected COVID-19 case in use at each participating ED is provided in Table 2S-Supplementary material. Definition criteria had changed over time in 90% of centers, reflecting the very dynamic adjustments made to face a rapidly evolving crisis. At the time of survey, any child with flu-like illness or fever was considered as a suspected COVID-19 infection in 67% of centers. Countries with a longer time interval from their first COVID case were significantly more likely to adopt this definition.",

            "text": ",19 Our findings show that a written and documented contingency plan was still missing in approximately one third of centers one month after the onset of the outbreak in Europe. While the majority had not faced an epidemic or a mass casualty event in the past five years, nearly 40% had never run a simulation on how to manage such a crisis in the ED. Although children have shown to be relatively spared from this pandemic,5,6,20 timely preparation and appropriate response areessential to minimize the transmission of the infection to both patients and healthcare professionals. Healthcare facilities have played an unwillingly significant role in increasing viral transmission in this pandemic.21 For physicians taking care of children in the ED, COVID-19 has rightfully been defined a logistic rather than a clinical emergency, and the low numbers of patients seen in participating EDs confirms this.22 While by March 20th nearly all participating centers had received a formal plan for the management of pediatric suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, many faced common challenges: the lack of unequivocal definition of pediatric suspected cases and the need of continuous adjustments secondary to the rapid change of definitions and management plan; the late training in PPE use and shortage in PPE supplies; the need for extra-resources to set up a pre-triage; the rearrangement of staff shift work to minimize infection spread or to cover for sick colleagues; the lack of negative pressure isolation rooms (if new hospitals are being built, the pandemic perspective isolation rooms should be used); the lack of outpatient services to follow up discharged children with confirmed COVID-19, with possible avoidable representations to the ED; the possibility to admit adult COVID-19 patients into pediatric beds; the difficult balance of resource use.A striking finding of our point prevalence survey was the wide variation in reported PPE use at pre-triage and for the assessment of suspected COVID-19 cases. While the survey question might have been misinterpreted with respect to assessment by the emergency physician, as to whether or not this included erosol-generating procedures, suboptimal reported practice still emerged from responses. Appropriate PPE use is paramount for staff safety and to reduce the risk of viral transmission.23,24 Although tracheal intubation, manual ventilation or noninvasive ventilation are rarely needed for pediatric COVID-19 patients,5,6,20 nearly 80% of participating EDs performed swabbing, which is classified as an erosol-generating procedure.",

Healthcare workers at triage should maintain special distance of at least 1 metre and provide the patient with a medical mask (if tolerated); no PPE is required if preliminary screening does not involve direct patient contact.25,26 Nearly half the centers reported a shortage of PPE, most often masks. PPE use should be maximized to avoid shortage of supplies, which ultimately exposes staff and the broader community to an increased transmission risk. One third of respondents stated that respirators (N95/FFP2 or FFP3/N100) are disposed of after the assessment of each suspected case. This practice may contribute to shortage of supply, as the same respirator could be used for more than one patient, as long as it is not damaged or soiled. A high percentage of centers reported infection in staff members. Unfortunately, infection of healthcare workers has been reported as a major threat to the sustainability of healthcare in this pandemic.23 In fact, the disposition of healthcare professionals who had been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case varies between centers, probably because of concerns regarding service provisions.",

It provides an accurate objective historical dataset from which lessons can be learnt for the future, including for adult practice. The collaboration of the REPEM and PERUKI European networks was instrumental to ensure wide representation of European countries and timely completion of this multinational point prevalence survey. The data provided highlights the importance of European multinational research collaborations to provide the best care to children in the frontline.In summary, we identified variability and gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children at one month since the start of the outbreak in Northern Italy. Early availability of a written and documented contingency plan including detailed infection control measures, the provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as key factors that should be optimized to improve the preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.",
