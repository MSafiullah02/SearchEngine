Among PAMPs, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a key hallmark of infection by negative-sense viruses. dsRNA is detected in the cytoplasm of an infected cell by viral dsRNA receptors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) [1] and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) [2]. Upon recognition of their ligand, these receptors initiate signaling pathways that result in the translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and other transcription factors to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, these transcription factors activate expression of interferons (IFN) \u03b1 and \u03b2, which initiate the antiviral response in the infected cells and prime neighboring cells for a rapid response to viral invasion.",

            "text": "Significant immunosuppression is noted in natural ebolavirus infection [12, 13]. Five species in the ebolavirus genus have thus far been described: Ebola (formerly known as Zaire), Sudan, Ta\u00ef Forest, Bundibugyo and Reston viruses [14, 15]. The VP35 protein of these viruses appears to play a key role in blocking critical immune signaling events early in infection. Indeed, VP35 has been shown to prevent phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF-3 [16], block induction of IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 expression [3, 16], inhibit activation of protein kinase R [17, 18], and serve as a suppressor of RNA silencing [19]. This ability of VP35 to block IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 expression has been mapped to its C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain [20, 21]. Recent structural analysis of the pathogenic EBOV [22, 23\u2022\u2022] and the nonpathogenic (to humans) Reston virus (RESTV) [24\u2022\u2022, 25\u2022] identified key residues critical for IFN inhibition and suggested a mechanism by which VP35 sequesters dsRNA and prevents it from being recognized by immune sentry proteins. Interestingly, the VP35 structures are largely similar between EBOV and RESTV; reasons why RESTV is nonpathogenic to humans remain unclear.",

In both structures, VP35 forms an asymmetric dimer that wraps about the end of the dsRNA. Within each dimer, one VP35 RBD monomer binds terminal nucleotides of the dsRNA as well as the backbone (\u2018end-capping\u2019). The other VP35 RBD monomer binds only the phosphate backbone of the dsRNA (\u2018backbone-binding\u2019) (Figure 1b). The two monomers together assemble a continuous, positively charged pocket for receiving dsRNA.",

Some flexibility is evident in residues 274\u2013281 (RESTV numbering), which forms a helix in the linker between the two subdomains of RESTV, but adopts a distinct loop structure in EBOV. The helical nature of the linker in RESTV could limit the flexibility required for multiple interactions between the VP35 RBD and the dsRNA. However, the conservation of structures and binding mechanism between pathogenic (EBOV) and nonpathogenic (RESTV) viruses suggests that the virulence determinant lies elsewhere: in a contact of the VP35 RBD with a non-dsRNA factor, in N-terminal regions of VP35, or in another component of the virus.",

Indeed, recent structural analysis of RIG-I in complex with dsRNA demonstrates that the different domains of the protein coat the phosphate backbone and also the terminal bases of the dsRNA [27\u2022, 28\u2022, 29\u2022, 30\u2022]. Hence, while other viral proteins, such as influenza NS1, appear to prevent dsRNA recognition by solely coating the dsRNA backbone [31, 32], ebolavirus VP35 caps the ends of the dsRNA and the specific recognition site of RIG-I. Whether VP35 also coats expanses of dsRNA backbone between the ends is currently unknown.",

Arenavirus infection often results in unchecked viral replication, failure to initiate an adaptive immune response and increased morbidity and mortality [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Mutagenesis throughout LCMV NP, before the availability of a structure, identified key residues within the C-terminal half of NP critical for such immunosuppressive function [5, 39]. However, the role of these residues, and the mechanism by which arenavirus NPs cause immunosuppression remained unknown. Recent structural analysis of LASV NP has shed light onto these questions [40\u2022\u2022, 41\u2022\u2022].",

The RNA-binding basic patch and the dimerization site of the VP35 RBD offer two targets for binding of small molecules that inhibit dsRNA binding. Compounds that target the exonuclease active site or the zinc-coordination site of NP may also prove to be useful antiviral therapies. In this endeavor, it will be important to develop compounds that are specific for arenavirus NP and do not cross-react to other, structurally similar host exonuclease active sites.
