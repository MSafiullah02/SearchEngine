            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae, causes one of the most widespread mosquito\u2010borne diseases in human. There are four serotypes of dengue virus, types 1 (DENV\u20101) to 4 (DENV\u20104), which have similar clinical manifestations and epidemiology in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [Wang et al., 2000]. DENV attacks a set of target cells, including dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, and disseminates in other non\u2010immune cells [Pagni and Fernandez\u2010Sesma, 2012]. Once DENV enters cytoplasm, its single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA genome is directly translated into a single polyprotein which is eventually cleaved into the 10 individual viral proteins, including three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven non\u2010structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [Chambers et al., 1990; Filomatori et al., 2006; Zybert et al., 2008; Idrees and Ashfaq, 2012].",

Currently, it is estimated that over 50 million cases of dengue infection occur annually, which have swept through more than 100 countries, with potential for further spread [Simmons et al., 2012]. From September to December 2014, an unexpected large outbreak of dengue infection with a significant proportion of severe cases was reported in Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province, China. It has been the most severe dengue epidemic over the years, with more than 40,000 cases was diagnosed, including five deaths (http://www.cdcp.org.cn). The emergence of the unprecedented magnitude of dengue outbreak has aroused widespread social concern. In this situation, the WHO considers the development of an effective dengue vaccine to be a high priority. Due to great endeavor of scientific researchers from around the world, Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, Rh) has become the first licensed vaccine available to prevent DF. However, for now there is no available antiviral agent approving for combating DENV [Idrees and Ashfaq, 2012]. Therefore, under current circumstance, the pressing task is to develop safe and effective antiviral drugs against dengue.",

For example, triterpenic compounds, such as glycyrrhizic acid (GRa), glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa), and some of their derivatives have been demonstrated to block the replication of a broad spectrum of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS related coronavirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, flaviviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), hepatitis B and C virus, influenza virus, rotavirus, adenovirus, etc. [Dargan et al., 1992a,b; Takahara et al., 1994; Matsuo et al., 2001; Cinatl et al., 2003; Crance et al., 2003; Lin, 2003; Orlent et al., 2006; Cos et al., 2008; Ashfaq et al., 2011; Hardy et al., 2012; Smirnov et al., 2012]. Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, is similar to substances found in the root of licorice plant. With a steroid\u2010like structure, CBX has been clinically applied in the treatment of gastric ulcers and other types of inflammation [Connors, 2012]. Besides, CBX is best known in cellular physiology as an effective, water\u2010soluble blocker of gap junctions [Rozental et al., 2001]. In earlier studies, CBX was reported to exhibit complex activities against herpes simplex virus (HSV), including synthesis, processing, and transportation of viral gene products [Dargan and Subak\u2010Sharpe, 1985, 1986; Dargan et al., 1988]. Nonetheless, whether CBX has an inhibitory effect on DENV remains unknown.",

Our data showed a dose\u2010dependent inhibition of DENV\u20101 and DENV\u20102 progeny virions following treatment with indicated concentration of CBX. Moreover, pre\u2010incubating DENV\u20102 with CBX remarkably abolished virus infectivity and decreased virus titer. Furthermore, treatment with CBX significantly decreased DENV RNA from progeny virions in the supernatants. Our results for the first time identify the old drug CBX as a novel anti\u2010DENV compound, and it might be developed as a potential treatment for dengue infection.",

Therefore, CBX concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 \u00b5M were considered for the following assay. To examine the effect of CBX on DENV infection, A549 cells were infected with DENV\u20101 Hawaii strain and DENV\u20102 New Guinea C strain, respectively, and incubated for 24 hr in the presence or absence of CBX. As shown in Figure 1c and d, the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose\u2010dependent manner. At concentrations of 50 and 100 \u00b5M, CBX treatment led to 500\u2010 and 1500\u2010fold reduction of DENV\u20101 titer, respectively (Fig. 1c). Likewise, at 25, 50, and 100 \u00b5M CBX, around 20\u2010, 2000\u2010, and 5000\u2010fold lower levels of DENV\u20102 titer were observed than control, respectively (Fig. 1d).

Antibody specific to the DENV structural prM protein was used in this part of the study. The percentages of prM containing cells were calculated to determine the expression of viral protein (Fig. 3d and f).

Starting at 1 hr prior to DENV infection (pre\u2010treatment); 0 hr concurrently with viral infection till 24 hr post\u2010infection (post\u2010treatment); from 1 hr prior to viral infection till 24 hr post\u2010infection (continuous\u2010treatment), or till 16 hr post\u2010infection (short\u2010treatment). Cell supernatants were harvested for TCID50 assay. As shown in Figure 4b, both post\u2010treatment and continuous\u2010treatment of cells by CBX led to approximately 3000\u2010fold reduction of progeny virus titer. By contrast, pre\u2010treatment with CBX did not have a significant impact on DENV\u20102 yields (Fig. 4b). As CBX can freely shuttle into cytoplasm by all three treatments mentioned above [Parke, 1983; Connors, 2012], this result indicates that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV is not exhibited by targeting the host cells. When eliminating CBX from the media at 16 hr post\u2010infection (short\u2010treatment), the titer of progeny DENV\u20102 particles also was not affected (Fig. 4b). In our DENV\u20102\u2010infected system, newly formed virions began to secret from A549 cells at 16 hr post\u2010infection (data not shown). So at this point, short\u2010treatment as mentioned can prevent progeny virions from contacting with CBX. Therefore, these results from time\u2010of\u2010addition study suggest that CBX inhibits DENV by directly targeting the infectious virions extracellularly.",

Beside DENV\u20102, DENV\u20101 viruses were also used to verify the inhibitory effect of CBX. All the results have demonstrated that the antiviral activity of CBX has no specificity on cell type or DENV serotype, which might predict CBX as a new anti\u2010DENV compound to exhibit favorable application perspectives.",

            "text": "Previous study has showed that, glycyrrhizin, another effective compound derived from glycyrrhiza, inhibited DENV infection in Vero cells [Crance et al., 2003]. This promoted us to suppose that CBX, one of the derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa), may play an effective role in anti\u2010DENV infections. As observed in our study, CBX treatment significantly reduced the progeny virus yield of different serotype of DENV (1 and 2). Further study found that CBX inhibits DENV infection through its virucidal activity. Beside DENV, CBX has been previously found to inhibit another virus, HSV [Partridge and Poswillo, 1984; Dargan and Subak\u2010Sharpe, 1986]. However, the antiviral mechanisms of CBX on these two viruses are quite distinct. In regarding to HSV, CBX appeared to be active throughout the replication cycle: by reducing the synthesis of some polypeptides, affecting the transportation of certain proteins, and inhibiting the post\u2010translational processing. As a result, CBX treatment greatly diminished progeny HSV quality, and it is thought to inhibit HSV infection in a non\u2010specific manner, by altering cellular activities that can affect virus replication or activate host antiviral mechanisms. While in our model, CBX directly inhibited the infectivity of DENV particles without targeting the host cells. Likewise, further study found that pre\u2010incubation with CBX significantly decreased VSV titer. Taken together, it suggests that the antiviral activity of CBX was not limited to a specific type of virus, and the mechanisms might be something different.",

            "text": "To be pointed out, CBX is a widely used compound as an inhibitor of gap junctions [Connors, 2012]. Gap junctions are fast\u2010track intercellular communication routes. Genetic studies have revealed that connexin (Cx) protein is the molecular component of vertebrate gap junction channels [Paul, 1986]. Gap junctions comprise clusters of transcellular channels that allow small signaling molecules and inorganic ions to transfer rapidly and directly from one cell to another. Recent studies have reported that gap junctions play key roles in the physiological processes and pathological conditions of several viruses, such as HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Borna disease virus, and Rous sarcoma virus [Eugenin, 2014]. Importantly, in order to increase virus production, infection with the latter two viruses above results in down\u2010regulation of Cx expression. As a non\u2010specific gap junction blocker, CBX inhibits various Cx proteins including Cx26, Cx32, Cx36, and Cx43 [Tonkin et al., 2015]. Therefore, the possibility that CBX inhibits DENV infection through blocking Cx proteins could not be ruled out.",

Further studies in suitable animal models would also be required to evaluate the reproducibility of the inhibitory effects of CBX in vivo. In conclusion, our work provides compelling data that CBX has inhibitory effect on DENV infection. Importantly, the antiviral activity of CBX is not limited to a specific cell type or a specific DENV serotype. Combined with its history as a clinical treatment for gastric ulcers or inflammation with a good safety profile [Turpie and Thomson, 1965; Ram et al., 2009], CBX might potentially be developed as a promising antiviral drug for dengue infection.",
