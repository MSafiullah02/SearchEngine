Wark et al21 subsequently provided a mechanistic insight into why this might be the case with studies involving cultured BECs from adult asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects obtained by means of bronchoscopy, followed by infection with rhinovirus in vitro. Although rhinovirus induction of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and CCL5 was not different between the 2 groups, asthmatic BECs produced lower levels of the type I IFN-\u03b2 and also had higher levels of rhinovirus replication. Importantly, deficient IFN-\u03b2 expression was observed in both steroid-treated and steroid-naive asthmatic subjects. The asthmatic BECs responded to exogenous treatment with IFN-\u03b2, exhibiting reduced rhinovirus release and demonstrating that the deficiency in asthmatic cells was associated with production of antiviral IFN-\u03b2 rather than the actions of IFN-\u03b2.",

In a more recent study, this time in subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma, Bullens et al23 demonstrated that IFNL1, but not IFNL2/3, mRNA levels obtained from sputum cells negatively correlated with asthma symptoms, again highlighting a protective role for IFN-\u03bb in asthma.",

Because asthmatic subjects have deficient IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb, and perhaps some of the IFN-\u03b1s,24 it is less likely a result of a polymorphism in one of these genes or their promoters. A polymorphism in a gene encoding a transcription factor or signaling molecule required for the expression of all these interferons is a more likely possibility, however.25 Interestingly, Thomas et al26 recently demonstrated that excess TGF-\u03b2 present in asthmatic airways mediates enhanced rhinovirus replication, probably through its suppressive actions on host type I interferon responses. Specifically, the effect of TGF-\u03b2 appeared to be mediated through actions on interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 pathways.26\n",

However, in asthmatic subjects the eosinophil infiltrate was more prolonged and still present 6 to 8 weeks after infection.45 In adults with allergic rhinitis, experimental rhinovirus infection increased allergen-induced eosinophil numbers in BAL fluid,46 and in asthmatic adults eosinophil products were increased in sputum.32 In addition, airway hyperresponsiveness correlated with rhinovirus-induced eosinophils, as reflected by an increase in eosinophilic cationic protein in sputum supernatants.32\nIn vitro experiments indicate that rhinoviruses do not activate eosinophils directly47 but rather probably through the activity of virus-induced mediators, adhesion molecules,48, 49 or cytokines secreted by T cells, epithelial cells, or other airway cells.50 It remains unclear, however, whether eosinophils contribute to host defense or to the immunopathology observed after viral infection.

Indeed, a recent proteomic analysis identified 191 different proteins in human induced sputum.53 In asthmatic subjects the major mucin components of airway mucus secretions are MUC5AC and MUC5B, which contribute to the viscoelastic properties of the mucus.54 He et al55 have shown that rhinovirus-16 infection of undifferentiated BECs induces secretion of MUC5AC. Zhu et al56 have recently demonstrated that rhinovirus induces mucin production in epithelial cells and that this depends on viral replication and at least partly on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, a PRR that specifically recognizes viral double-stranded RNA. Hewson et al57 have recently shown that rhinovirus induction of MUC5AC in BECs occurred through nuclear factor (NF) \u03baB\u2013dependent induction of matrix metalloproteinase\u2013mediated TGF-\u03b1 release. This activates an epidermal growth factor receptor\u2013dependent cascade culminating in specificity protein 1 transactivation of the MUC5AC promoter. After experimental infection with rhinovirus-16, Hewson et al57 also demonstrated increased MUC5AC production in healthy and asthmatic volunteers in vivo. This was related to viral load in asthmatic subjects but not healthy volunteers.",

The first indication of a TLR recognizing a viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern was in the case of TLR4 and RSV fusion protein.58 Since then, several studies have demonstrated that in response to viral infection, TLR3,59, 60, 61, 62 TLR7,63, 64 TLR8,63, 64 and TLR965 are involved in induction of type I interferons. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR3 are particularly relevant in relation to RNA viruses because they recognize and respond to single-stranded viral RNA and double-stranded viral RNA, respectively. TLR3 recognizes rhinovirus and is upregulated on infection. Blocking TLR3 suppresses antiviral responses, and rhinovirus replication and release is increased.59 Roponen et al66 recently demonstrated impaired TLR7 function in adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma; however, the ability of a TLR3 ligand to induce key antiviral molecules was similar in asthmatic and control groups. Moreover, polymorphisms of TLR7 and TLR8 have been shown to be associated with asthma, identifying TLR7 and TLR8 as novel risk genes in subjects with asthma and related disorders.67\n",

These observations support an important role for rhinovirus-induced lower airway inflammation in precipitating asthma exacerbations, perhaps through impaired TH1/IL-10 and augmented TH2 responses.9 Epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus secrete CCL5 and CXCL10, which both promote T-cell chemotaxis.69 Levels of CXCL10, a chemokine that binds to CXCR3, are increased in virus-induced asthma exacerbations.

In addition, genes involved in regulating interferon production have been identified. The transcription factor IRF1 is centrally important to regulating IFN-\u03b3 production and function. The IRF1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31 in the TH2 cytokine cluster involved in the development of allergic disease, and almost 50 polymorphisms of the IRF1 locus have been analyzed. Eleven are significantly associated with atopy, total IgE levels, or specific IgE levels.92 In addition, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) regulates IFN-\u03b3 signaling and antiviral responses, and a significant association between a polymorphism in the SOCS1 promoter and adult asthma has been observed. This polymorphism resulted in increased production of SOCS1 protein, which in turn inhibited phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in response to IFN-\u03b2 stimulation.93\n",

This susceptibility might then allow rhinovirus replication in the lower airways to develop, especially in asthmatic subjects in whom there is reduced protection offered by epithelially derived interferons. Bedke et al106 recently infected normal and asthmatic airway fibroblasts in vitro with rhinovirus-1B, illustrating both the ability of fibroblasts to support viral replication and their vigorous proinflammatory response with induction of IL-6 and IL-8. This latter response compounds the existing airway inflammation to contribute to an exacerbation. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that exogenous IFN-\u03b2 protects fibroblasts against infection, providing further support for its potential use as a therapy against virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

Treatment of corticosteroid-resistant asthmatic subjects with IFN-\u03b1 in one case series led to improved lung function and a reduction in oral corticosteroid use; however, the majority of subjects experienced side effects, including a \u201cflu-like\u201d illness, nausea, and headaches.130 A number of other trials have assessed the use of intranasally administered IFN-\u03b12 in healthy volunteers undergoing experimental rhinovirus infection. These studies showed a dose-dependent improvement in symptom scores and reduced viral shedding, but side effects were again a problem.131, 132, 133 An approach using interferon aims at boosting host defense rather than targeting specific respiratory viruses. This is a significant advantage over specific antiviral approaches because it would treat all virus-induced asthma attacks rather than just those caused by a specific virus. Despite the problems with side effects in the early trials, there are sufficient in vitro and in vivo data supporting a re-examination of this treatment approach. Similar approaches aiming to boost antiviral activity with TLR ligands are also in development.",

The use of gene array analysis to determine whether asthma is associated with a unique pattern of epithelial cell gene expression after viral infection has the potential to radically improve our understanding of the immune pathways involved and has the potential to identify such new therapeutic targets. Although this approach has been performed in vitro on cultured epithelial cells,134 gene expression of either BECs or alveolar macrophages during experimental infection in vivo has yet to be performed. Moreover, future studies will need to sample both asthmatic children and nonatopic asthmatic subjects to gain a more complete picture of the role of viruses in asthma exacerbations. Finally, our understanding of the effect of virus-induced exacerbations on subsequent remodeling and development of severe airflow obstruction requires further study.",
