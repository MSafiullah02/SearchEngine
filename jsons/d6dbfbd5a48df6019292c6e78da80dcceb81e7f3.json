Entero-viruses have been seen in European bison, Yak, Cape buffalo, and Sika deer, rotaviruses in Scimitar horned oryx, and suspected corona and arenaviruses in Oryx and Yak respectively. The significance of these viruses is unknown. Routine bacteriology is now carried out on a much greater number of post-mortem cases by the pathology unit at Regent's Park and, in selected instances, samples for virological examinations from carcases are also collected. The possibility that the chronic diarrhoea seen in some of the ruminant species may be caused by mycobacteria is being investigated with the help of the Institute for Research on Animal Disease, Compton. The routine parasitological examination of gastro-intestinal tracts at Regent's Park continues and has revealed species not reported in the last 10 years from the collection, including the abomasal nematodes Haenzonchus contortus, Skrjabinagia kolchida and S. Iyrata. H. contortus may be partly responsible for diarrhoea, poor growth rate and loss of condition in some of the European bison.",

This enzyme is released from damaged muscle cells. Reports of selenium deficiency are becoming more frequent in domestic ruminants in this country and in order to monitor the selenium status of animals at Whipsnade, estimations of Glutathione peroxidase have been carried out at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge. Most results indicate an adequate to high level by the standards of domestic ruminants. The results of estimations of copper levels in blood and liver samples taken over the past eight years show that both potentially toxic, and marginal or deficient levels can occur in different ruminant species on the same pasture, receiving the same diets (Ashton, Jones & Lewis, 1979) . The highest liver levels were seen in neonatal deer, with concentrations of up to 5000 ppm in the liver of Moose, Hog, Axis, Sika, Fallow and Swamp deer. The adult copper levels of these species were invariably lower, and in the few instances where both foetal and maternal levels were obtained, the ratio of foetal to maternal concentration was between 10 and 30. The lowest liver levels (less than 15 ppm) were seen in the large bovids and Red deer, with some values considered to be marginal or deficient by domestic ruminant standards. The monogastric ungulates (Equidae, Rhinocerotidae, and Suidea) showed much less variation and clinically normal animals usually had liver copper levels in the range of 20-50 ppm.",

Fenbendazole is a relatively new benzimidazole derivative with activity against larval and immature worms and is being tested, with the help of the manufacturers, in ruminants and carnivores. Better results are obtained with doses given over a five day period, than with a single dose at the standard rate. Mebendazole has been used for some time in the routine treatment of the Equidae, but its palatability has made it useful for the treatment of other species. It is very effective at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 10 days for the elimination of Trichuris sp. from Moose. This is the first in-feed drug used at Whipsnade that has been efficient against this parasite, and on two occasions has resulted in the elimination of Trichuris eggs from the Moose faeces for periods of up to three months. Thiophenate medicated pellets fed to several ruminant species was effective in a single dose, but some animals found the preparation unpalatable. Pyrantel embonate was introduced as an anthelmintic for the Equidae because, despite routine treatment with mebendazole, the faecal egg counts, particularly of the Przewalski horses, Common zebra and Cream ponies were beginning to rise. The use of a chemically unrelated drug appears to have solved this problem.",

In the winter of 1976-7, eight Mouflon died with suspected parasitic gastro enteritis. Since the use of fenbendazole, no deaths from this cause have occurred. In other groups such as the Scimitar horned oryx, frequent anthelmintic treatment failed to eliminate clinical signs of parasitism. The younger subordinate animals were particularly badly affected and in two which died, abomasal nematode counts of 15,900 and 17,400 were recorded, with similar numbers in the small intestines The Oryx were kept with a large group of Llamas which grazed the paddock heavily to prevent possible digestive disturbances in the Oryx. Although the Llamas were treated individually with anthelmintics before introduction to this paddock, the high stocking rate, coupled with the high susceptibility of the Oryx to gastro-intestinal nematodes, appears to have been responsible for their loss of condition. Routine blood samples for haematology, biochemistry (including glutathione peroxidase) and copper estimations have shown no consistent abnormalities. Removal of the Llamas from the paddock., and frequent anthelmintic treatment of the Oryx, should prevent a recurrence of this problem.",
