These acquired enzymes display an extremely wide spectrum of hydrolysis that includes also carbapenems. The MBL-encoding genes commonly occur as cassettes in integrons carried by a variety of transferable plasmids and enterobacterial chromosomes underscoring their spreading potential. Indeed, a physical linkage of MBL integrons with transposable elements has been, in some instances, documented. VIM and IMP \u03b2-lactamases \u2013 the main MBL types found in enterobacteria \u2013 have already achieved a global spread, the southern Europe and the Far East being the most affected regions. There are quite a few epidemiological studies unveiling the mode of spread of MBL-producing enterobacteria. Nevertheless, our understanding of what MBL production entails in terms of clinical impact is still limited. It is not yet clear if MICs of MBL producers must be consider at face value or these isolates must be reported as potentially resistant to carbapenems. Moreover, performance of the routine detection methods based on EDTA-\u03b2-lactam synergy is not optimal and not yet standardised. The aim of this presentation is to discuss recent advances on genetics, epidemiology and clinical significance of MBL-producing enterobacteria.",

Consequently Europe has had several different sets of antimicrobial breakpoints and a range of variations in technical methods. It became increasingly evident that harmonisation of breakpoints was necessary both for therapy and resistance surveillance. ESCMID set up EUCAST in 1997 with a representative from each European country and 6 representatives from industry. In 2002 EUCAST was restructured and the major responsibility for the work of EUCAST was taken on by the active national breakpoint committees in Europe. A Steering Committee was formed, currently comprised of a representative from the 6 active national breakpoint committees, 2 from the EUCAST General Committee (which has a representative from each European country), a Chairperson, a Scientific Secretary and a Clinical Data Coordinator. A decision making process was established whereby proposals made by the Steering Committee are distributed to the EUCAST General Committee, relevant expert groups and industry for consultation. The final decision is made by consensus in the Steering Committee, taking account of any comments made during consultations. In this process the expertise of the national breakpoint committees is utilised, there is wide consultation on proposals and the national committees take responsibility for implementation of decisions. Subcommittees have been set up to deal with specific topics including susceptibility testing of fungi and anaerobes, and expert rules in susceptibility testing. A website has been established (http://www.EUCAST.org) that gives details of EUCAST activities, EUCAST breakpoints and publications. Another website has been developed for the collection of MIC data and its presentation as species-specific wild type MIC distributions. EUCAST has been funded by ESCMID, the national breakpoint committees, a grant from the EU and now by ECDC. Industry does not contribute financially but is asked to contribute data required for determining breakpoints and to comment on proposed breakpoints. EUCAST has achieved harmonisation of most existing breakpoints in Europe. It has a formal relationship with EMEA regarding the setting of breakpoints for new agents and the revision of breakpoints for existing agents. The process has been applied to several new drugs. Documents on various aspects of susceptibility testing have also been published.",

But most of these data come from surveillance studies on all uropathogens in regional bacteriological laboratories. Important selection of urine samples occur in this setting: most samples sent to the bacteriological laboratory came from complicated infections, immune-incompetent patients or people with urologic problems such as pyelum stones. In contrast, the majority of cystitis is encountered in healthy women, so extrapolation of these resistance data is speculative. We performed a surveillance in this healthy population with cystitis and found no alarming resistance at all; moreover, a new surveillance 10 years later showed no increase of resistance in uropathogens encountered in these women. This means that nitrofurantoin remains the first choice in the Belgian GP-guideline (the same applies to the Dutch and the French guideline) Trimethoprim can still be useful but in GB and in the Netherlands more resistance has been observed.

In some communities, CA-MRSA account for more than 70% of community S. aureus isolates. These isolates typically have a unique staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCCmec IV) that carries the antibiotic resistant genes and is lower in molecular weight than the cassette carried by the typical nosocomial MRSA isolates. CA-MRSA isolates generally are susceptible to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline. CA-MRSA S. aureus isolates also typically carry the genes coding for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) although the role of PVL in the pathogenesis of infections remains unclear. In the United States one particular clone identified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), USA300, accounts for the vast majority of CA-MRSA isolates. Other clones predominate in different areas of the world. The genomes of two CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 and USA400 (MW-2) have been fully sequenced and may eventually provide clues to why USA300 has been so successful in spreading and causing infection. By far the most common infections associated with CA-MRSA isolates are skin and soft tissue infections including abscesses and cellulitis. CA-MRSA as a common aetiology of abscesses is much better documented because of the ease of culturing purulent drainage. In children the most common sites of infection are the buttock, perineum and extremities. CA-MRSA isolates are also associated with serious invasive infections, especially osteomyelitis and pneumonia. Recurrent soft tissue infections and infections within the family caused by CA-MRSA isolates are common. The most important aspect of management of superficial skin and soft tissue infections is appropriate surgical drainage. Most clinicians also administer an effective oral agent such as TMP-SMX or clindamycin, although the contribution of antibiotic therapy after surgical incision and drainage is under investigation. Empiric vancomycin or clindamycin is typically administered for more serious and invasive infections such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis or suspected Staphylococcal pneumonia in regions where CA-MRSA is common (>5\u201310% of community S. aureus isolates). Clindamycin is efficacious in treating CA-MRSA infections caused by susceptible organisms. Effective measures to prevent CA-MRSA infections remain unclear.",

The genome of S. aureus consists of a core element (approximately 80% of the entire genome), a core variable element and a so called variable or accessory genome. This model, attractive because of its simplicity, would suggest that the core genome would encode the overall S. aureus-characteristic traits whereas the core variable and variable moieties encode factors that provide S. aureus with more strain or clone specific traits.",

The differentiation between CA-MRSA and hospital-associated (HA) MRSA is becoming difficult since CA-MRSA could spread into hospitals. CA-MRSA cause skin and soft-tissue infections, but can also cause necrotising tissue infections and fulminant pneumonia. Most CA-MRSA strains produce the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL), a leukocyte pore-forming toxin strongly associated with invasive disease and virulence. Transmission of CA-MRSA from person to person has been well documented and ascribed to close contact, e.g. during sport practice or prison stays. Also transmission can occur among family members. In the United States, CA-MRSA has been reported as the most frequent cause of soft-tissue infections. The predominant CA-MRSA clone is the USA300, belonging to Clonal Complex (CC) 8, characterised by a particular pulsed field gel electrophoresis pattern, SCCmec type IV, and encoding PVL production. The CA-MRSA prevalence in Europe is diverse. Although rates of HA-MRSA are very high in England and South Mediterranean countries, CA-MRSA has been more frequently reported in Northern and Central European countries. Isolates of CC80-SCCmecIV have been the predominant genotype in many European countries since late 1990s (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Germany, England, France or Switzerland). However, another dominant genotype, CC8-SCCmecIV, related to clone USA 300, emerged in 2003 and spread through many countries (Netherlands, France, Spain, Switzerland, Greece or Norway). In Spain, with high endemic rates of HA-MRSA, isolation of PVL-positive CA-MRSA has been increasing in the last years. The predominant clone of CA-MRSA in Spain is the CC8-SCCmecIV, affecting family groups and patients with recent travel or family relation to countries in South America. A worrisome feature is that isolates of pandemic genotype CC5-SCCmecIV (paediatric clone), highly prevalent among HA-MRSA in many European countries, have been found to carry PVL toxin and to be CA-MRSA. Prevention and control of CA-MRSA infections outside the healthcare setting represent a real challenge for the health system and may be a serious problem in containing the spread of CA-MRSA within the hospital population.",

The most frequently detected viruses were parvovirus B19 and HHV-6, already present in donor kidneys, and BKV and EBV, usually acquired during follow-up. In most cases, viral DNA persisted in the kidney allograft during follow-up. Univariate and multivariate cox-proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated that, among viruses, only the intrarenal persistence of B19 DNA was significantly associated with the development of chronic allograft injury, whereas HCMV DNAemia, but not allograft infection, was a risk factor for acute rejection. Analysis of matched data on intrarenal viral DNA detection and DNAemia indicated that HCMV did not involve the kidney allograft in the course of systemic infection. Instead, B19 targeted the kidney, where it established prolonged infection. Both the early transcript NS1 and the late lytic transcripts VP1, VP-2, and 11kDa were expressed in biopsies from patients with primary acute infection and DNAemia, whereas only NS1 was expressed in biopsies from patients without DNAemia. These results indicate that, after acute infection, characterised by expression of all viral genes, B19 establishes persistent infection in the kidney, characterised by expression of the early gene NS1 only. Kidney injury might be linked to persistent B19 replication in the allograft, but also to expression of the pro-apoptotic NS1 protein.",

Since that time MLST has become a gold standard method for the characterisation of many bacterial pathogens and a number of non-pathogens. MLST has made it possible to compare the bacterial isolates obtained in different parts of the world and at different times simply and accurately using generic techniques but without the necessity of sharing reagents or isolates. In addition to solving many of the problems inherent in the characterisation of isolates from diverse recombinogenic bacteria, MLST has also provided data that have enabled extensive studies of bacterial population genetics, speciation, and evolution, providing substantial added value to epidemiological studies. The MLST approach also provides indications as to the most efficient means of exploiting the next generation of DNA sequencing machines.",

These viruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantavirus. Unlike most other Bunyaviridae, hantaviruses are not arthropod-borne (arboviruses), but are ROdent-BOrne, roboviruses. Each hantavirus is primarily carried by a distinct rodent/insectivore species although a few host switches seem to have occurred during the tens of millions of years of their co-evolution with their carrier animals. Hantaviruses are maintained by cyclical transmission between persistently infected rodents, with incidental infection of humans. Transmission occurs primarily by inhalation of aerosols from infected rodents' urine, faeces or saliva. Hantaviruses are found worldwide and are known to cause two serious and often fatal human diseases: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). More than 20 hantaviruses have been identified, approximately half of which are known to cause HFRS or HPS. The serotypes Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus predominantly cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterised by renal failure, haemorrhages, and shock. Whereas hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is a severe cardiopulmonary illness most often caused by the Sin Nombre virus. The illness begins as a nonspecific febrile prodrome, and then patients quickly develop noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and shock. The overall case fatality rate of HCPS is approximately 40 percent. The pathogenesis of HFRS is poorly understood. However, it is known that \u03b23 integrins can mediate the entry of pathogenic hantaviruses and that hantaviruses can regulate apoptosis. Also there is evidence and that increased capillary permeability is an essential component in the pathogenesis of both HFRS and HCPS, although different target tissues, kidneys and lungs are affected in the two diseases. HFRS patients show locally increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the plasma and kidneys and high levels of urinary secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection is primarily based on serology, since viral RNA cannot be regularly detected in the blood or urine of patients. Both immunofluorescence tests and enzyme immunoassays are widely used for detection of specific IgM or low-avidity IgG antibodies, characteristic of acute infection. Vaccines against hantavirus infections have been used for years in China and Korea, but not in Europe or the Americas. No specific therapy is used in Europe, although both Ribavirin and interferon-\u03b1 have been successfully used in trials in China. The high rate of mortality could be reduced if effective therapeutics could be discovered for treatment of this illness.",

Sensing of microbial pathogens, either in tissue in contact with the host's environment or in the systemic circulation after invasion of the bloodstream, is carried out by macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes and monocytes acting as sentinels of the innate immune system. Recognition of invasive pathogens by immune cells relies on their capacity to detect microbial molecular motifs, such as endotoxin, peptidoglycan subcomponents, lipopeptides, glucans, mannans, flagellin and nucleic acids via microbial-recognition receptors. Microbe-associated molecular motifs bind to a family of microbial recognition molecules expressed by immune and non-immune cells, including CD14, Toll-like receptors, peptidoglycan-recognition proteins, nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like receptors, helicase-domain-containing like receptors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (Mda5), C-type lectin receptors (such as dectin-1) and the triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) receptor family. Ligand-activated receptors turn on signal transduction pathways and the transcription of immune genes resulting in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules at the cell surface and in the release of immunoregulatory effector molecules in the extracellular compartment. Until recently increased knowledge of the pathophysiological basis of sepsis did not translate into clinical benefit. Lately, however, several treatment approaches have for the first time yielded encouraging, albeit still arguable results (i.e. early-goal directed therapy, activated protein C, hydrocortisone therapy, and intensive insulin therapy).

M2 can only be determined after the benefit of the active control over placebo (M1) has been demonstrated in studies showing superiority over placebo or a less effective active control. No placebo-controlled trials have been conducted in CAP. Historical evidence of antibiotic efficacy in CAP has been derived from estimates of mortality. Thus, an estimate of clinical response for M1 can only be derived indirectly. Some assumptions are made:1) efficacy can only be estimated for an antibiotic with in vitro activity; 2) efficacy in CAP is derived from patients with bacterial infection; 3) clinical response results in improvement within 72 hrs; 4) M2 should preserve 50% of M1.

Interestingly, eleven out of 16 BLSE-producing isolates expressed an OXA-19-like enzyme. Routine tests (double-disk synergy and inhibition by cloxacillin) failed to detect this OXA-type ESBL, which is poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid while inhibited by cloxacillin, like AmpC. In conclusion, ESBL- and MBL-producing PA are still rather unfrequent in France, with the predominance of an underrecognised OXA-type ESBL.",

Inhibition of bacterial efflux mechanisms appears to be a promising target in order to restore antimicrobial susceptibility in MDR bacteria.

However, for most substances concentrations necessary to restore antimicrobial susceptibility were too high for clinical use, which might be ascribed to insufficient increase of intracellular concentrations of antimicrobials. The present study set out to investigate the potency of various efflux pump inhibitors (EPI) to overcome MDR and to explore changes of intracellular concentrations of ciprofloxacin for the most potent substances.",

They were mainly described in Klebsiella pneumoniae and associated with nosocomial outbreaks. This situation dramatically changed in the last few years worldwide, and most of the ESBL-producing isolates are now Esherichia coli expressing CTX-M enzymes. The majority of them are now recovered from community patients, mainly from urinary tract infections (UTIs) and new risk factors have been identified. Moreover, an increase of ESBL-producing isolates has been detected in nursing homes and healthcare associated facilities in the community, with the potential influx of ESBLs from the community to the hospital. Also, an increasing prevalence of faecal carriage with ESBL-producing isolates in outpatients and healthy volunteers has been described. ESBL producers are also recognised in other non-hospital compartments, including farm and companion animals and in the environment. The population structure of CTX-M-producing isolates is complex and was initially associated with a polyclonal spread of ESBL-producers (described as allodemia) and/or specific plasmids or other mobile platform genetic elements. Nevertheless, the application of an MLST typing scheme on ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in addition to a PFGE based scheme shows a new situation with the description of successful internationally disseminated multiresistant clones harbouring specific (epidemic) plasmids. The case of CTX-M-15 illustrates this situation. The ST131 E. coli clone belonging to phylogroup B2 and associated with a multidrug-resistant IncFII plasmid harbouring the blaCTX-M-15 gene has been found in different countries all over the world and mostly isolated in patients with UTIs in the community. Other examples of well dispersed ESBL in the community are CTX-M-14, CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-2. The former has been frequently reported in West Europe and North America with the potential dispersion of an epidemic plasmid in different clones. CTX-M-1 is prevalent all over Europe while CTX-M-2 in South America and Asia. Moreover, ESBLs belonging to classical groups, such as SHV-12 and TEM-52, seem to be also well dispersed in the community compartments. TEM-52 is widespread in Europe and associated with Salmonella isolates, and more recently with E. coli isolates in UTIs. Although the association of blaESBL genes with successfully mobile genetic platforms has been magnified as an important factor for the increasing prevalence of ESBLs, the presence of specific virulence determinants in ESBL producers might also has facilitated the persistence and subsequent dispersion of ESBLs. In addition, co-resistance to non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotics not only decreases therapeutic treatment options in community patients but also might has facilitated co-selection processes and maintenance of ESBL producers. It is remarkable that most of the new plasmid mediated resistance genes, including qnr, aac(6\u2032)-Ib-cr and qepA affecting fluoroquinolones or the methylase genes affecting aminoglycosides (armA and rmtB), have been found in ESBL-producing organisms in several community compartments. With this landscape, reversion of the current pandemic situation of ESBLs in the community seems to be difficult and new strategies should be designed at local and international levels to curtail the spread of these enzymes.",

They confer resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Chromosome-encoded cephalosporinases with extended spectrum of activity towards ceftazidime or cefepime have been also reported in E. coli, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter sp. The carbapenemases that hydrolyse at least imipenem, ertapenem or/and meropenem are of the Ambler molecular classes A, B, and D in Enterobacteriaceae. The emerging carbapenemases in are mostly the plasmid-mediated KPC, VIM/IMP and OXA-48 enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae.

In P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, \u03b2-lactamase mediated resistance to carbapenems is also emerging. In P. aeruginosa, the metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (IMP, VIM; SPM, GIM) are reported worldwide as a source of nosocomial outbreaks. In A. baumannii, although metallo \u03b2-lactamases are known, the acquired oxacillinases that are quite specific to Acinetobacter sp. (OXA-23, OXA-40, OXA-58-types) are the main source of carbapenem resistance. The natural reservoir of carbapenemases is unknown with the noticeable exception of the blaOXA-23 and the blaOXA-48 genes that we have identified as being Acinetobacter radioresistens and Shewanella sp., respectively. Finally, resistance to carbapenems may result in all Gram-negative species from impaired permeability (or/ and overexpression of efflux) together with overexpresssion of \u03b2-lactamases with very weak carbapenemase activity.",

The latter infections, often with associated underlying disease, carry an increased risk of Gram-positive and Gram-negative co-pathogens. These infections, occurring in hospitalised patients, are unlikely to rapidly resolve with surgical measures alone; assessment of severity may help determine when emergency surgery and antibiotics are required. Severity assessments for SSSIs include clinical signs of systemic inflammation and local findings, particularly the size of abscesses or cellulitis, or signs of necrotising infection, including bullae and subcutaneous haemorrhage. In these more severe cSSSIs, empiric therapy effective against the organisms subsequently identified on culture is important in limiting the extent of tissue loss and more rapidly resolving the acute illness. In the US and some European areas, the frequency of MRSA associated with SSSIs has risen dramatically in the past 5 years, reaching up to 60%.

However epidemiological, clinical and biological data obtained from staphylococcal infections in human concur to demonstrate that PVL is a virulence factor in human involved in human primary skin infection, necrotising pneumonia and bone and joint infection but not in other diseases.

Clinical signs of invasive candidiasis manifest only late, representing a particular challenge for diagnosis, and remains characterised by a mortality similar to septic shock (40% to 60%). An improved knowledge of the pathogenesis of candidiasis and the availability of new compounds for pre-emptive and prophylactic therapy have contributed to improve the prognosis of severe Candida infections, to the possible cost of the emergence of non-albicans Candida strains with reduced susceptibility to imidazoles. Despite growing evidence in the literature, guidelines do not integrate systematic antifungal prophylaxisfor patients at risk and empiric treatment for those who are septic with major risk factors and without documented source of infection. The Figure propose a practical approach (Adapted from: P. Eggimann, J. Garbino, D. Pittet. Management of Candida species infections in critically ill Patients Lancet Infectious Diseases 2003; 3:772\u201385). In order to avoid exposure of patients at lower initial risk, pre-emptive antifungal treatment should be based on the combination of the presence of risk factors with the dynamics of Candida colonisation. Finally, in non-immunocompromised patients critically ill patients, prophylaxis should be strictly restricted to highly-selected groups of patients in whom it's efficacy is proven.",

Several prediction rules and scoring systems have been proposed to identify subpopulations of ICU patients who would benefit from prophylaxis. These rules identify different percentages of patients \u2013 up to 85% in some centres. Many have been created and validated within the same database and none are practical or have proven robustness across all ICU populations. Cost effectiveness has never been evaluated and numbers needed to treat to prevent a single case remain high in centres with a prevalence of less than 20%. Centres reporting high prevalence of candidal infection should address infection control issues before resorting to prophylactic drugs. Diagnosis still relies on conventional microbiological techniques of culture from sterile sites but the role of biomarkers (antigen and PCR testing) merit further investigation in ICU populations. The high negative predictive value of these newer assays has the potential to influence antifungal strategy by identifying patients who do not have fungal infection. Combined with a robust and simple model to predict the risk of developing invasive Candida infection, these tests that can rapidly exclude fungal infection in high-risk groups and allow a targeted (pre-emptive strategy) to be developed and supersede unnecessary prophylactic treatment.",

Interestingly, in strain E1071 another 8.3-kb element with no homology to the PAI of E1162 was integrated at the same position. PCR demonstrated that in all 17 PAI-positive isolates the PAI was integrated in the DO orf1671 homolog. In 23/33 PAI-negative strains, PCR confirmed no integration at this site, however, in one isolate PCR indicated integration of a fragment of at least 13-kb. In 9 strains no PCR product using primers spanning the integration site was obtained suggesting either integration of DNA elements too large to amplify or polymorphisms at the primer annealing site.",

Both were chromosomally-encoded and PCR mapping revealed identical genetic environments for Pa MUS and the Belgian isolates. While most oxacillinases are integron located, blaOXA-18 lacked gene cassette specific sequences but was inserted into an aac6\u2032 Ib gene cassette. In addition, it was bracketed by two novel insertion sequences of ISCR family. It is likely that these ISs were at the origin of the blaOXA-18 gene mobilisation. Furthermore, detailed analysis of an 8.5-kb cloned genomic fragment containing blaOXA-18 gene revealed co-linearity of the blaOXA-18 gene and the integron containing blaOXA-20 gene. PFGE defined genetic relatedness between the three Belgian Pa isolates and Pa MUS strain.

Our research group has recently reported that meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains can form biofilm independent of the icaADBC-encoded exopolysaccharide. Here we report that mutation of sortase, which anchors LPXTG-containing proteins to peptidoglycan, impaired MRSA biofilm development. Furthermore deletion of fnbA and fnbB, which encode the LPXTG-anchored multifunctional fibrinogen and fibronectin-binding proteins, FnBPA and FnBPB impaired MRSA but not meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) biofilm development, apparently at the level of intercellular accumulation and not primary attachment. The MRSA fnbAB biofilm defect was complemented by fnbA or fnbB alone. Correspondingly, mutation of fnbA or fnbB alone did not substantially affect biofilm and overexpression of either gene alone in MRSA and MSSA activated biofilm. Interestingly FnBP-promoted biofilm was dependent on SarA, but not at the level of fnbA or fnbB transcription. Using plasmid constructs lacking regions of FnBPA to complement an fnbAB mutant revealed that the A domain alone and not the BCD domain required for fibronectin binding could promote biofilm. Additionally, an A domain N304A substitution which abolished fibrinogen binding did not affect biofilm. These data identify a novel S. aureus biofilm phenotype promoted by FnBPA and FnBPB, which is apparently independent of the known ligand-binding activities of these multifunctional surface proteins. Given that implanted surgical and medical biomaterials are rapidly coated by a conditioning film composed primarily of extracellular matrix proteins, our findings suggest that these cell-wall-anchored proteins are important virulence factors in device-related S. aureus infections, particularly those caused by MRSA strains, and may represent attractive therapeutic targets.",

Many of these infections involve Staphylococci spp. which are capable of developing antibiotic resistance. Community or nosocomial acquired microbial antibiotic resistance is eroding the miracle of antibiotics and jeopardising both human and animal welfare. With evidence of increased frequency of resistance to vancomycin, our current most potent antibiotic, the drive is on to develop novel therapeutic agents. RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP) therapy represents an exciting alternative. Staphylococci (like S. aureus and S. epidermidis) can become virulent and cause diseases through the formation of biofilms and production of toxins. This process is regulated by cell-to cell communication mechanisms, termed quorum sensing (QS). RIP is a heptapeptide (YSPWTNF-NH2) that inhibits QS, and in its presence, the bacteria are no longer virulent and do not cause disease. RIP has been shown to be extremely effective in preventing and treating drug resistant staphylococcal infections in multiple experimental infection models (tested in mice, rats, rabbits, cows) against various drug resistant strains like MRSA, VISA, MRSE, and VISE. RIP has also been demonstrated as very effective in treating clinical human chronic wound infections in a polymicrobial setting involving multiple types of bacteria. RIP is synergistic to antibiotics and thus can be used (alone or in combination) systemically, topically, or by coating medical devices to suppress infections, including those caused by antibiotic resistant strains.",

            "text": "In recent years, resistance to macrolides in Streptococcus pneumoniae has increased in many areas of the world, including Europe. According to the European Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance System, that collects data from invasive isolates, in 2006 most European countries reported a proportion of erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates between 10 and 25% with 6 countries, including Italy, reporting a proportion higher than 30%. The bimodal distribution of the erythromycin minimal inhibitory concentrations of resistant isolates reflects the well-known resistant phenotypes and the corresponding genotypes: high-level macrolide resistance associated with resistance to lincosamides and streptogramin B (the MLSB phenotype) conferred by the Erm(B) ribosomal methylase, or low-level resistance to macrolides only (M phenotype) due to an efflux pump encoded by the mef-msr(D) genes. The relative proportion of isolates carrying either mechanism varies between the different countries and is changing with time. In addition, isolates carrying both resistance mechanisms are becoming increasingly common. Other uncommon genotypes, generally associated with low to moderate-level erythromycin resistance, are represented by point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA genes or in the ribosomal proteins, and by the erm(A) gene, encoding for an inducible methylase. Although the main genotypes responsible for erythromycin resistance in S. pneumoniae are well known, the genetic elements on which the resistance genes reside and that represent the vehicle for their transmission are only recently starting to be elucidated. The elements carrying the macrolide efflux pumps in S. pneumoniae are defective transposons: mef(A) is carried by Tn1207.1 and mef(E) is carried by mega. These two elements are similar, but their distribution and properties are very different. mefA/Tn1207.1 is characteristic of a serotype 14 international clone (England14\u20139) and its insertion in a competence gene makes the isolates unable to be transformed. Therefore mefA-carrying isolates are usually susceptible to penicillin and most other non-macrolide antibiotics. Isolates carrying mef(E)/mega are heterogeneous in serotype and genetic background and tend to be multidrug-resistant, due to the capability of mega to associate with other antibiotic-resistance transposons, notably with Tn916, carrying tetracycline resistance. Transposons of the Tn916 family are vehicle also for high-level macrolide resistance due to erm(B). Recent studies have shown that erm(B) is often associated with Tn916-like transposons, although tetracycline resistance can be phenotypically unexpressed. The composite transposons have a modular structure, where Tn916 represents the backbone and the modules include one or more macrolide resistance elements, such as mega, Tn917, or the erm(B) element. Although these composite transposons are not conjugative in S. pneumoniae, the natural transformability of the pneumococcus ensures their transmission within the species. The study of the resistance elements carried by particular clones can contribute to the understanding of the evolution of macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae: for instance, the low-level erythromycin-resistant international clone Taiwan19F-14 has evolved into the double-macrolide gene isolates of the CC271 complex.",

Resistance mutations are found in the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of ParC, ParE or GyrA and can be acquired by point mutation, by intraspecific recombination or by interspecific recombination with the viridans streptococci of the mitis group (SMG). The current prevalence of Fq-resistant (FqR) SPN is lower than 3% while in the SMG is higher than 13%. Acquisition of resistance by interspecific recombination could be much more common than by point mutation, considering the frequencies of these events in laboratory conditions (10\u22123 and 10\u22129, respectively). However, recombinants account for less than 11% of the SPN FqR isolates. Besides other factors, such as the availability of DNA in the natural environment and the competence state of the cells, one cause that could account for the low frequency of the FqR recombinant isolates is the fitness cost imposed by the DNA interchange that often implies the acquisition of larger parE-parC intergenic regions. A parallel study of transcription of parE-parC and of the fitness cost of 24 isogenic FqR strains derived from R6 was performed. Six first-level transformants were obtained either with PCR-products containing parCQRDRs of SPN FqR point mutants or with a PCR-product carrying parEQRDR-ant-parCQRDR from a FqR SMG isolate. The latter yielded two strains, T6 and T11, carrying parCQRDR and parEQRDR-ant-parCQRDR, respectively. The first-level transformants were used as recipients in further transformations with gyrAQRDRs PCR products to obtain 18 second-level transformants. RT-PCR experiments showed cotranscription for parE and parC in R6, T6 and T11, and a single promoter located 5\u2032 of parE was identified in R6 by primer extension. Fitness of transformants were estimated by pairwise competition with R6 in both 1-cycle and 2-cycle experiments. In 1-cycle experiments, only strains carrying the GyrAE85K change showed fitness cost, with the exception of recombinant T14. In 2-cycle experiments, cost was observed in first-level transformants carrying FqR changes S79F, S79Y, D83Y and GyrA E85K, with the exception of recombinants T6 and T11. Results suggest that there is no impediment due to fitness cost for the spreading of recombinant FqR SPN isolates, since some recombinants exhibited a compensation of the cost.",

These infections usually occur by contiguous spread from soft tissue infection, and markedly increase the risk for hospitalisation and amputation. Most infections are caused by staphylococci, but other organisms can be involved, sometimes in a polymicrobial infection. The first task for the treating clinician is to diagnose bone infection accurately. This is best done by obtaining a bone specimen (either percutaneously or at surgery) for both culture and histology. Among the available imaging tests, MRI is clearly the best; bone scans are too non-specific. Clinical signs and symptoms are unreliable, but the probe-to-bone test is easy and relatively helpful. Recently, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot proposed a diagnostic scheme that estimates the likelihood of osteomyelitis based on combinations of various clinical and laboratory test results.",

In this study, we demonstrate that the adaptation process of PA predominantly comprises metabolic pathways. In end-stage mutator strains, several transcripts of genes or proteins involved in metabolism of fatty acids, nucleotides, amino acids and the generation of energy were increased. Of particular interest is the increased expression level of genes involved in (i) the anaerobic arginine-deiminase pathway, (ii) the anaerobic respiration (iii) the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and glyoxylate shunt and (iv) the uptake of dicarboxylates. These changes in transcriptome and proteome indicate an adaptive shift towards constitutive expression of genes of metabolic pathways obviously required for growth under micro-aerobic and nutritional conditions of suppurative CF lung tissue.

Nosocomial outbreak associated and most clinical isolates cluster together by multilocus sequence typing in a hospital-adapted genogroup, designated as clonal complex-17 (CC17). Recently, five genes encoding LPXTG surface proteins were found to be enriched in CC17 E. faecium isolates. One of these five, sgrA, formerly known as orf2351, is present in all of the CC17 E. faecium isolates and in only 26% of the non-CC17 E. faecium isolates.

Some patients are left without a therapeutic option because of resistance against all available antibiotics. No doubt, resistance is outrunning antibacterial research and development. Since the 1980s, the focus of most pharmaceutical companies shifted from antibacterial to more lucrative disease areas that promise to meet the financial targets of the big companies. To reduce the risk and to speed up development time, many companies are presently limiting their antibacterial programmes to building on existing classes of antibiotics \u2013 developing analogues that lead to second and third generations of the original compound.

The high and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria among patients admitted to European hospitals in addition to high antibiotic consumption and shortcomings in infection control measures increase the risk of significant outbreaks caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens among the critically ill. In countries with previously low resistance levels (Scandinavia, Finland and the Netherlands), the frequency of multi-drug resistance (MDR), particularly MRSA, may increase rapidly if surveillance and measures to combat outbreaks fails. The need for an early warning system of emerging and/or increasing antibiotic resistance for local, national and international use is apparent. A programme for continuous yearly registration of antibiotic use, resistance and clinical practices with automatic feedback through a website was developed for use in ICUs. It was launched as \u201cCARE-ICU\u201d in 2005. Antibiotics to which >90% of isolates of a species were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (TA90) which is a novel index of susceptibility to measure the magnitude of MDR. Thirty four ICUs in 8 countries participated in the large pilot during 2005. The median yearly admissions and admission days were 551 and 2595 respectively. There were four important main findings in this first report from CARE-ICU. First, antibiotic consumption varied widely from 348 to 4992 DDD1000 with a relatively high median consumption of 1254 DDD1000. Second, levels of antibiotic resistance was very high in many settings but varied also greatly between species, ICUs and countries and the finding that more than half of all participating ICUs had no or only one treatment alternative (TA90) for P. aeruginosa with at least 90% susceptibility to aminoglycoside, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and carbapenem was alarming. Third, there was a lack of rooms for isolation precautions and cohort care for patients colonised or infected with alert organism. Four, antibiotic guidelines including routines for discontinuation of antibiotics, was available in some of the high antibiotic consuming ICUs but with low compliance which shows the need for more effective tools for change of prescription behaviour and a sustainable surveillance of compliance to guidelines in general.",

Since the generalised use, for newborns and children only, of the first pertussis vaccines, called Pertussis whole-cell (Pw) vaccines, because composed of inactivated bacterial suspensions, Pertussis is still endemic. Why? The use of Pw vaccines led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of the disease in children but conducted to demonstrate and confirm that Pertussis is not a paediatric disease. Pertussis can infect children, as well as adolescents or adults. The disease is dramatic for newborns but also for persons at risk such as elderly and pregnant women. One of the characteristics of Pertussis is to induce a short immunity, as well as Pw vaccines. A human can be infected two or three times during its life. Twenty years after the introduction of Pw vaccines for children, adults are no more immune and can contaminate newborns too young to be vaccinated. For this reason, the introduction of vaccine boosters was needed. This was possible after the development of Pertussis acellular (Pa) vaccines, composed of purified inactivated bacterial proteins. Since 1995, these vaccines are used for newborns and children but also for adolescents and adults in many developed countries in Australia, North America and Europe. However, vaccine coverage of adolescents and adults is still low and mortality of newborns less than 2 months of age is now again observed in developed countries. Adequate pertussis surveillance and reporting system are important to implement vaccine strategy. They must be reinforced to evaluate the consequences of the changes of (i) pertussis vaccine used (Pa instead of Pw), (ii) vaccine strategy (addition of adolescents and adults boosters), (iii) characteristics of the disease necessitating the development of new specific, sensitive and standardised biological diagnoses, (iv) bacteria circulating since herd immunity will be modified by universal immunisation and might have an impact on the properties of the agent of the disease.",

For example, in a low-level MRSA setting isolation facilities or staffing levels may be sufficient to allow all detected cases to be effectively and promptly isolated. In contrast, in high-level MRSA settings resource limitations (e.g. limited availability of isolation beds and insufficient staffing levels) can delay the time to effective isolation or make some interventions, such as nurse cohorting, entirely unfeasible. Under such circumstances an intervention that results in epidemic control in a setting with a low MRSA prevalence can fail in a high prevalence setting. Thus, two stable outcomes are possible even with identical control measures are in place. If interventions are put in place early enough they can successfully maintain infection at a low level preventing high-level MRSA becoming established. If put in place too late, or compromised by immigration of MRSA from other settings, identical interventions can have a much smaller effect, only slightly suppressing MRSA levels, and failing to reduce prevalence to a low level. Transitions between these two outcomes are known mathematically as catastrophes, and can also have catastrophic consequences for patient welfare. Simulation models have shown that both stochastic fluctuations, and immigration of MRSA cases from other settings can, in principle, lead to such catastrophic shifts from successful control to control failure. In this talk, the evidence that such catastrophic transitions also occur in practice will be reviewed, making use of new statistical developments for analysing hospital infection data and highly detailed MRSA transmission data.",

The ebp locus is regulated in part by the Fsr system, a homologue of the Agr system of staphylococci. We have also identified a ubiquitous collagen adhesin, Ace (also an MSCRAMM), whose expression is induced by serum and collagen, and found that this adhesin is also important in E. faecalis EIE. Similarly, we have shown that its homologue (Acm, an adhesin to collagen of E. faecium), is important in the pathogenesis of E. faecium EIE and adherence to heart valves, the first factor shown to be important for virulence in that species. Preliminary data suggest that immunisation against recombinant Ace or Acm is protective against EIE by the producing species. Based on genome searchs, both E. faecalis and E. faecium have a number of other MSCRAMM genes encoding adhesins to ECM proteins, and future studies may reveal additional contributions to IE. Another factor shown to be importance in E. faecalis IE is gelatinase, a protease produced by only ~60% of E. faecalis despite the fact that the encoding gene gelE is found in over 90% of stains; deletion of part of the regulatory locus, fsr, explains the lack of gelatinase production by many strains. Aggregation substance, encoded by pheromone responsive plasmids found in some E. faecalis, and a cytolysin/hemolysin may influence the size of EIE vegetations and mortality produced by E. faecalis, respectively. Additional studies are needed to define the role of other factors in enterococcal EIE and the ability of passive or active immunisation to prevent this disease.",

            "text": "\nEnterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium have both evolved in so-called high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (HiRECC), defined as specific clades of isolates with multiple antibiotic resistance traits, epidemiological associated with either colonisation or infection of hospitalised patients. One of these HiRECC is E. faecium CC17, which represents a distinct pandemic clonal complex of extremely successful hospital acquired isolates. Also in E. faecalis specific genetic subpopulations exist, like CC2, CC9, and CC40, which are enriched among nosocomial isolates and as such can be classified as HiRECC. Thus E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates belonging to these HiRECC share niches with the potential of virulence gene exchange. The extent of genetic exchange, especially of virulence genes between these two species is unknown but can be disclosed by assessing the presence of orthologs in E. faecalis and E. faecium clinical isolates. Comparative genomic hybridisation and whole genome sequencing, implemented to identify genes specific for CC17, distinguished more than 100 genes with most notably CC17 specific IS elements, resistance genes, genes putatively encoding cell surface proteins and metabolic pathways. Of a subset of these E. faecium CC17 genes orthologous genes were identified among E. faecalis bloodstream isolates. Eight of these orthologs were highly similar to genes previously found on EfaB5, an E. faecalis Tn916-like element containing several genes related to virulence in other species. The sequence identity of EfaB5 orthologous genes between E. faecalis and E. faecium was >85%, which is considerably higher than the sequence identity of the core genomes of the two species, based on an in silico comparison and reflected by the relative high average of 16S rRNA sequence divergence (4.1%) and the low average nucleotide identity of housekeeping genes (74.2%). The E. faecium EfaB5-like orthologs, though highly similar to the E. faecalis EfaB5-like element, are not similarly organised in one cluster but separated by stretches of other genes and the order partially inverted. The presence of highly similar genes in HiRECC E. faecium CC17 and E. faecalis CC2, 9, and 40, suggests genetic exchange between the most prevalent clinical enterococcal subpopulations. A common EfaB5-like element, in addition to E. faecium and E. faecalis specific virulence determinants, might have contributed to pandemic spread and nosocomial enterococcal infections.",

The initial scenario consisted of polyclonal enterococcal population with a high diversity of strains and transposable elements encoding vancomycin resistance in the community and with scarce presence in the nosocomial setting. In the last few years six European countries have reported prevalence rates in hospitals >20% and nosocomial VRE outbreaks are frequently described. Clonal and plasmid outbreaks have been documented in European hospitals but complex epidemiological situations involving strains (Enterococcus faecalis and/or Enterococcus faecium) and different mobile genetic elements are frequently reported in institutions with high VRE rates. Population genetics studies have shown that most VRE isolates from hospitalised patients belong to worldwide disseminated hospital high-risk clonal complexes (HHRCCs) of E. faecalis (CC2, CC9, CC21, CC87) and E. faecium (CC17) often resistant to multiple antibiotics, while VRE from non-hospitalised individuals or animals belong to other CCs. In addition, specific HHRCCs or clones within these HHRCCs become relevant in the persistence and dissemination of VRE. Horizontal transfer is also important in the recent spread of VRE in European hospitals although plasmid outbreaks have been described since early 90's. The most frequent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance found is VanA and the genes coding for resistance are part of Tn1546, usually located in conjugative plasmids. Variants of Tn1546 containing mutations, deletions and different insertion sequences have been described and an apparent high diversity and host specificity of these genetic elements has been suggested. However, the detection of different Tn1546 variants in common plasmids platforms suggests frequent genetic exchange events within particular wide disseminated plasmids. A change in the epidemiology of VRE in European hospitals seems to have occurred with the emergence and dissemination of specific plasmids and HHRCCs resistant to multiple antibiotics and possibly more transmissible and virulent.than others Situations of endemicity or polyclonal outbreaks are difficult to handle since limite therapeutic options and require genotyping-targeted infection containment. Detailed characterisation of epidemic VRE strains and mobile elements will help to understand the reasons involved in the evolutionary outcomes of HHRCC in different countries.",

All but two isolates belonging to subtypes A2 and A3 carried the OXA-23-like gene in addition to the intrinsic OXA-51-like gene. The most likely mode of transmission was cross-transmission from colonised or infected patients and the environment via the hands of personnel. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that severity of illness (mean daily SAPS II score > median) and intensity of care (mean daily TISS-28 score > median) were independent risk factors for acquisition of the outbreak strain (OR 6.67; CI95 1.55\u201336.56 for both variables).",

There were 51 males and 32 females with the mean age of 62 years (range: 19 to 99 years). Most patients had received antibiotics within three months before the diagnosis of A. baumannii bacteraemia. Third-generation cephalosporin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (78.9%). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was the most common primary site of infection, followed by catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI), intraabdominal infection, and skin and soft tissue infection (45.8%, 20.5%, 7.2% and 2.4%, respectively). There were 16 patients (19.3%) with unknown source of infection. The mean duration of intubation in the patients with VAP and that of central venous catheter insertion in those with CRBSI before the diagnosis of A. baumannii infection were 9.46 days and 12.07 days, respectively. Most A. baumannii isolates were susceptible to cefoperazone-sulbactam (48.2%), followed by netilmicin (44.6%) and amikacin (31.3%). Of all isolates, the frequency of carbapenem-, multidrug-, and pan-drug-resistant A. baumannii was 69%, 45.8%, and 27.7%, respectively. The overall inhospital mortality rate was 69.9%, with high mortality rate in the patients in medical intensive care units (ICUs), compared to those in non-medical ICUs [92.6% and 58.9%, odds ratio (OR): 8.712, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.876\u201340.457, p = 0.002]. The patients infected by multidrug- and pandrug-resistant strains had much higher mortality rate than those infected by non-multi- and pandrug-resistant strains (80.3% and 40.9%, OR: 5.898, 95% CI: 2.046\u201317.002, p = 0.001). Pneumonia had higher mortality rate than other source of infections (81.6% and 60%, OR: 2.952, 95% CI: 1.071\u20138.136, p = 0.03)",

PCR is a more accurate and rapid technique, but requires substantial labour and technical competence. PCR is also affected by inhibitors, sample cross-contamination, and limited ability to concentrate samples. All of these limitations are overcome by the GeneXpert\u00ae system. This automated system uses a low-cost plastic cartridge to concentrate all the bacilli present in a sputum sample, remove inhibitors, lyse cells, and transfer the DNA into an integrated PCR tube. This DNA is amplified in a nested, real-time PCR using an optimised, six-colour Molecular Beacon assay to detect more than 95% of all rifampin-resistant TB strains. An internal sample processing and reagent control is also included. Sample processing and nested PCR occur within the same cartridge and no external manipulation is required after the sample is initially loaded.",

Key pathogens associated with nosocomial pneumonias include meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Effective management involves accurate diagnosis, timely selection of initial appropriate antibiotics at effective doses and administration routes, and implementation of optimal prevention strategies. Due to variability of offending organisms within different treatment settings, initial therapy for HAP and VAP should be individualised. Selection of broad-spectrum agents should be based on many variables, including patient risk factors (eg, recent antibiotic exposure, comorbidities, duration of hospitalisation), suspected pathogens, pharmacokinetic considerations, and resistance dynamics. Following 48 to 72 hours of therapy, the patient should be assessed for de-escalation strategies based on clinical response and laboratory tests. Dosing flexibility in patients with VAP or severe sepsis is crucial to ensuring optimal resolution. Recent clinical trials suggest that doripenem might provide additional value for therapy of HAP, including VAP. A multidisciplinary approach with implementation of pan-European guidelines for HAP based on care bundles should be viewed as an opportunity to optimise management of HAP in Europe.",

The limitations of infant B cell responses result not only from the interference by antibodies of maternal origin but also from the weaker induction of antibody-secreting plasma cells within Germinal Centres, which has emerged as a generic determinant of the magnitude of early life antibody responses and calls for the development of specific adjuvant or formulations. Importantly, infant antibody responses are also of much shorter duration than those elicited later in life, which may result into secondary vaccine failure. In infant mice, this rapid decline of vaccine-induced antibodies results from the failure of bone marrow niches to efficiently support plasma cell survival through the production of sufficient level of APRIL, a limiting factor that is unlikely to be easily circumvented and calls for the administration of early booster doses.",

The first surveys in natural bacterial populations, conducted in E. coli and Salmonella spp., revealed a higher than expected prevalence of mutators (around 1%), supporting the hypothesis that hypermutation could act as a mechanism for acceleration of bacterial evolution in nature. Nevertheless, the first evidence for a specific role of hypermutation in human infections was obtained from the study of P. aeruginosa chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, in which the prevalence of hypermutable strains was by far the highest ever found in nature. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that hypermutation is indeed a common feature of P. aeruginosa chronic respiratory infections occurring in patients with chronic underlying respiratory diseases such as CF, bronchiectasis, or COPD with a prevalence ranging from 30 to 60% of the patients, whereas the prevalence of mutator strains is very low (<1%) in acute infections. A high prevalence of mutators in the CF setting was also found later for other pathogens such as S. aureus and H. influenzae. Results from recent studies, involving mouse models of chronic infection and long-term longitudinal studies of CF isolates, have shown that hypermutation indeed plays a relevant role in two major aspects of P. aeruginosa chronic respiratory infections: bacterial adaptation for long-term persistence of infections and antimicrobial resistance development. The molecular basis of hypermutation are defects in genes involved in DNA repair or error avoidance system which have been deeply studied in E. coli. Among them, the gene coding for the Epsilon subunit of the DNA polymerase III (dnaQ or mutD), the genes involved in the Mismatch Repair (MMR) System, mutS, mutL, mutH, and UvrD (mutU) or the genes belonging to the GO system for DNA oxidative lesion repair, mutT, mutM and mutY. In CF P. aeruginosa strains, as well as in other natural bacterial populations, the most frequent mechanism leading to hypermutation is the inactivation of the MMR System, that along with mutation rates, increases also by 1000-fold the rates of recombination between divergent DNA sequences.",

Although S. aureus hypermutators, deficient in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system have been created in the laboratory (e.g. mutS and mutL mutants), the occurrence of staphylococcal hypermutators in the clinical setting appears to be variable, with some groups reporting their presence and others not. Furthermore, a S. aureus mutL mutant has recently been reported to exhibit decreased fitness in a model of chronic bone infection and there is no evidence that intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin in clinical isolates of S. aureus (VISA) evolves in hypermutable hosts, despite the fact that resistance to vancomycin in these strains probably requires multiple mutations in chromosomal genes. Therefore hypermutation may not play a major role in the development of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus. Possible reasons for this situation will be discussed.",

Four of these mutations (A77V, N114D, P167S, and D288N) were required in successive steps to obtain CTX-M-58, which showed the highest CAZ MIC (256 \u03bcg/mL). Distinct evolutionary pathways to obtain CTX-M-58 are possible. Moreover, A140S change (also present in CTX-M-58) was highly beneficial to the CAZ/CTX resistance phenotype when introduced in the last step, although its presence in intermediate mutants yielded a neutral or even deleterious effect (sign epistasis). In evolutionary routes involving D240G change, lower increases in MIC values than those observed among P167S route were observed, being the presence of both changes in the same background selectively inaccessible.

Five of the completely sequenced plasmids confer resistance to macrolides and other antimicrobial compounds. Two of these plasmids, namely pB4 and pRSB111, belong to the IncP-1 incompatibility group combining very promiscuous, self-transmissible broad-host-range plasmids. The pB4 tripartite multidrug efflux system consisting of a permease of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family, a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) and an outer membrane factor (OMF) confers resistance to erythromycin and roxithromycin. Plasmid pRSB111 encodes a macrolide phosphotransferase and a transmembrane transport protein that are both required for high-level macrolide resistance. Different variants of these enzymes are also encoded on the mobilisable multidrug resistance plasmid pRSB101 and the IncF-like plasmid pRSB107 which also contains virulence-associated modules. Finally, the IncP-6 erythromycin resistance plasmid pRSB105 harbours the resistance genes mel and mph, encoding, respectively, a predicted ABC-type efflux permease and a macrolide-2\u2032-phosphotransferase. Many more macrolide resistance genes could be detected in plasmid-DNA preparations from WWTP bacteria by hybridisation experiments using a resistance gene microarray representing 192 different resistance genes. Among these are different ere genes encoding erythromycin esterases, erm genes for rRNA adenin N-6-methyltransferases and mef genes specifying macrolide efflux proteins. To get a more complete picture of the plasmid metagenome of WWTP bacteria an ultrafast sequencing approach applying the 454-technology was carried out.

In addition to typical E. faecalis colonies, a SCV phenotype consisting of small pin-point colonies was detected in both blood cultures. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed clonal identity of both phenotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility as tested on blood-containing Mueller-Hinton agar was comparable. In order to characterise the SCV further we performed light, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission EM (TEM) of both phenotypes. In the Gram-stain, the SCV showed Gram-positive, inhomogenous cocci with irregular size while the isogenic normal phenotype appeared homogenously. By SEM, SCV varied in size between one-fourth and up to eight times the size of the normal phenotype. Irregular and multiple divisions were observed in SCV. In addition, debris covered SCV isolates and an intercellular substance was more abundant in SCV than in the normal phenotype. By TEM, multiple and irregular cross walls, large swollen-appearing cells as well as empty cells were observed in the SCV (Fig. 1\n). Growth curves of both phenotypes revealed marked slower growth of the SCV. The patient was treated with imipenem and rifampicin for six weeks and suffered from a relapse of the endocarditis three weeks later, requiring replacement of the prosthetic aortic valve.

The majority of clinically relevant ESBL variants derive from the genes blaTEM-1 or blaSHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration and increasingly from the acquisition and mutation of genes from the CTX-M gene family. In the past decade further enzymes like the OXA lactamases and plasmid-mediated AmpC lactamases have emerged in the clinics as a new severe problem as they are likely to hydrolyse modern cephalosporins. The presentation will demonstrate developments made under the German PathoGenoMik programme on the example of the ESBL chips as well as future routes for rapid microbial diagnostics in the clinic with special focus on novel technologies for faster assay times and microfluidic integration.",

Although they have the advantage of a finite duration of therapy, a persistent response (loss of DNA-HBV and of AgHbe) is obtained after the end of therapy in only one third of cases. They should only be proposed in patients with factors known to influence positively the outcome. A large number of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are, at present, available to treat hepatitis B. The efficacy of lamivudine alone, the first nucleoside analogue used, is limited by the high rate of resistance. Adefovir has efficacy comparable to that of lamivudine, but with low resistance rate. Entecavir and tenofovir are particularly active in the control of hepatitis B virus replication and are associated with minimal resistance development, even with long treatment duration. Other drugs, such as telbivudine, emtricitabine and clevudine, will become new treatment options in the near future. First-line therapeutic regimen usually include either a monotherapy with a potent agent that has a low rate of resistance; or could in the future include a combination of 2 nucleos(t)ide analogues. These agents have been shown to be effective in improving virological, biochemical, and histological features in high proportion of the patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, they can not eliminate hepatitis B virus and only suppress HBV replication. Furthermore, the emergence of drug resistant HBV is becoming problematic over the long-term. Therefore, physicians should be careful in selecting whom to treat, when to start treatment, how to monitor patients before, during and after the treatment.",

The simultaneous presence of these mechanisms confers efficient resistance to the strain ensuring its dissemination, the colonisation of the patient and favours the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. marA, ramA, and ompX are involved in a complex regulation cascade controlling membrane permeability and actively participate in triggering the MDR phenotype. Certain mutations in regulator genes induce the overexpression of efflux system and the downregulation of porin synthesis. In addition, specific molecules such as salicylate, imipenem or chloramphenicol are able to activate the MDR response. This phenomenon has been observed in vitro during culture of bacteria in the presence of drugs and during antibiotic treatment of colonised/infected patients.

Bacterial visualisation demonstrated waves of bacterial clearance and growth, which selected for bacteria expressing the phase variable outer membrane protein Opa, indicating the importance of this bacterial factor.

However, both wild-type meningococci and an LOS mutant induced equivalent disease severity and similar proinflammatory responses in TLR4+/+ mice, but failed to cause fatal sepsis in TLR4\u2212/\u2013 mice. Taken together, these data reveal novel disease dynamics and organ targeting during meningococcal disease.

The case fatality rate overall is approximately 8%, but amongst survivors there is a relatively high frequency of severe sequelae including hearing impairment, neuro-cognitive abnormalities, severe skin and soft tissue abnormalities including loss of limbs, and renal failure. Physicians and paediatricians who treat meningococcal disease observe a range of severity from relatively benign disease to severe physiological disruption leading to death. In general terms, those who present with meningitis tend to have a better prognosis, whilst those who present with severe sepsis syndrome have the worst prognosis. Study of factors associated with the severity of meningococcal disease is difficult and confounded by factors such as the sporadic nature of the disease and marked differences in access to health systems between individuals. Many studies have shown that the outcome of meningococcal disease is associated with the phenotype of the infecting organism. The odds of death from disease are highest for certain sequence types, for example ST-11/ET-37 complex and ST-32/ET-5 complex. The precise phenotypes responsible for the enhanced virulence of these sequence types has not been precisely defined. The major virulence determinants of Neisseria meningitidis include the polysialic capsule, LPS immunotypes, sialylation, and outer membrane proteins including Opa and Opc. Whilst there is no consistent segregation of virulence determinants in clonal groups associated with the most severe disease, organisms expressing serogroup C have been associated with fatal outcome.",

Twin studies have indicated that death from severe infectious disease has a familial component and in the case of meningococcal disease a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the role of genes encoding components of the immune system, the inflammatory response and coagulation pathways. The difficulty faced by geneticists is that death is the most easily verifiable end point for the purpose of studying genetic modifiers of severity of disease. Because of the death rate of only 8% this means that very small cohorts are available for study. However, association studies have revealed a relationship between a number of genes and the likelihood of death in meningococcal disease.

Acquired VanA- and VanB-type resistance in enterococci results from the production of modified precursors ending in D-Ala-D-lactate (D-Lac) to which glycopeptides exhibit low binding affinities, and the elimination of the D-Ala-D-Ala ending precursors synthesised by the host Ddl ligase. VanA-type strains show high-level inducible resistance to both glycopeptides, whereas VanB-type strains have variable levels of inducible resistance to vancomycin only, as teicoplanin is not an inducer. Six VanA-type meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, that have acquired the glycopeptide resistance vanA operon from enterococci, have been isolated in North America. In contrast to VanA-type resistant strains, S. aureus with intermediate level resistance to vancomycin (GISA) and heterogenous GISA (hGISA) are becoming prevalent worldwide. The mechanism of intermediate resistance in S. aureus is not well understood. Telavancin is a lipoglycopeptide that possesses a lipophilic decylaminoethyl sidechain added to the vancosamine sugar of vancomycin; this substituent confers a dual mode of action: 1)Like glycopeptides, telavancin binds to the C-terminus D-Ala-D-Ala of lipid II intermediates in peptidoglycan synthesis. Molecular studies have indicated that telavancin binds with 35-fold enhanced affinity to the membrane-embedded lipid II compared to the soluble target, thus providing an explanation for the enhanced transglycosylation inhibition. 2)Direct interaction of the drug with lipid II leads to disruption of the barrier function of the bacterial membrane. Exposure of S. aureus to telavancin results in time- and concentration-dependant loss of membrane potential and increased membrane permeability. Quantitative flow cytometry assays indicate that the majority of S. aureus are fully depolarised within 1 hour following exposure to clinically relevant telavancin concentrations. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the potent activity of the drug against GISA/hGISA clinical isolates, observed both in vitro and in vivo. In microorganisms with acquired Van-type glycopeptide resistance, telavancin, like teicoplanin, is not an inducer of the vanB gene cluster. Thus, VanA-type isolates have reduced susceptibility to telavancin whereas VanB-type strains remain fully susceptible.",

Tissue factor (TF) is regarded as the primary initiator of coagulation in severe infection. Effective blocking of the tissue factor pathway by either recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (rTFPI) or anti-tissue factor antibodies in experimental sepsis attenuates lung injury and partially prevents pulmonary dysfunction. In addition, inhibition of tissue factor activity prevents local activation of coagulation in models of pneumonia. Another mechanism that contributes to fibrin deposition in the lung is the local depression of fibrinolysis, due to the increase of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I. These effects on pulmonary coagulation and fibrinolysis are regulated by various pro-inflammatory cytokines. This lecture will discuss the regulation and impact of pulmonary coagulation during severe infection.",

These results suggest that tifacogin may reduce mortality in patients with sCAP who did not require heparin. This potential benefit of tifacogin is currently being tested in the Phase III CAPTIVATE study, in approximately 2100 patients. CAPTIVATE will compare current sCAP standard of care with a combination of sCAP standard of care plus adjunctive tifacogin, (either 0.025 mg/kg/hr or 0.075 mg/kg/hr in a 96 hour continuous infusion). The study objective is to determine whether treatment with tifacogin early in the disease process can reduce incidence of mortality by preventing the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ system failure. Study entry criteria were based on the 2007 IDSA / ATS guidelines plus a clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Specifically required are the presence of either 1 major criterion (requirement for mechanical ventilation, or need for therapeutic vasopressors), or 2 or more minor criteria (hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <250, respiratory rate \u226530/min, non-invasive ventilatory support, BUN > 7mM, new onset confusion, multilobar pneumonia, platelet count <100,000 cells/mm3 or a fall of >25% in previous 48 hours to <120,000, leukopenia or hypothermia).",

In patients with oncology/haematological diseases, the prevalence of OPC is conversely increasing, depending on the type of cancer and anticancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, ...). Candida albicans is the main species associated with OPC but non-albicans are increasing, while mutiresistant Candida albicans and non-albicans strains have emerged. These changes are a consequence of long term prescriptions of narrow spectrum antifungal agents and repeated prescriptions of oral systemic antifungal agents. Moreover, in this heavily treated immunocompromised population, it is important to limit the potential for drug-drug interactions. Therefore, national and international guidelines have been issued and recommend using a local antifungal therapy with a spectrum extended to all Candida species as first line treatment of OPC.

Despite good performance on health inspections, outbreaks of gastroenteritis per 1000 cruises increased almost tenfold from 2001 to 2004. The increase was mostly attributable to norovirus, and highlights the inability of environmental programmes to fully predict and prevent risk factors common to person-to-person and fomite spread of disease. The much publicised outbreaks and global threats have led the cruise companies to cooperate closely with local, national and international public health authorities \u2013 and with each other. These efforts have resulted in detailed protocols on how to deal with every aspect of shipboard sanitation: under normal circumstances, when there is a threat of an outbreak, and during an outbreak. They include mandatory hand disinfection for all persons entering the ship, and strict isolation demands for all cases of gastroenteritis for a minimum of 24 hours after the last symptom. Isolation aboard is difficult and risky. A bedside test to quickly diagnose or rule out norovirus is therefore high on the cruise industry's wish list.",

In addition, health systems have to cope with an unknown number of migrants that need treatment for a variety of conditions. Overall, information about relevant infectious diseases in endemic areas is comparatively easy to get. Information about the same diseases in returning travellers are much more difficult to acquire. Only few international studies have been done in regards of this question.

This enormously successful clinical experience comes in spite of its widespread use for non-approved indications, based on breakpoints that antedate the discovery of isolates with reduced susceptibility, without detailed appreciation of its tissue penetration, and sometimes under circumstances of suboptimal ancillary intervention (drainage, debridement or removal of foreign material). Most patients tolerate vancomycin well; not surprisingly, adverse effects do appear to be more frequent as higher than usual doses are utilised against infections due to organisms at the high end of the MIC distribution. Randomised, double-blind prospective clinical trials have largely failed to identify newer agents that are superior in clinical efficacy to vancomycin, despite tantalising signals of possible advantages of other agents against MRSA. Which, if any, potential advantages would support the anticipated differential in cost of the newer agents remains to be determined. With time, better antibiotics than vancomycin will be introduced, and they will assume their rightful place in therapy.

The pathogenesis of CDAD involves disturbance of the homeostasis of normal bacterial colonisation of the large bowel enabling the outgrowth of a pathogenic C. difficile strain. Recurrent CDAD may be explained by failure of antibiotics to eradicate C. difficile spores, which will germinate and grow out in a bowel that lacks normal colonic flora as host-defence mechanism. The absence of normal colonisation as defence mechanism is illustrated by the finding that 50% of clinical recurrences of CDAD may be caused by a different strain than the initial infecting strain (Wilcox, 1998). Furthermore, coinfection with multiple strains has been described. Patient factors associated with recurrence are older age and co-morbidity.",

A subsequent relapse can be treated with 2 weeks of vancomycin followed by a tapered-pulsed vancomycin regimen lasting for several weeks.

Clinical improvement was mostly seen after 1\u20134 days, and there was a response in 90% of the patients without reports of recurrence. Side effects related to faecal therapy have not been reported. The efficacy of faecal therapy against CDAD may be explained by (unknown) inhibitory substances (bacteriocins) produced by the infused donor bacteria and by restoration of faecal physiology by implantation of missing flora components. Importantly, randomised controlled trials are lacking and this may be the reason that faecal therapy has not become a generally accepted treatment strategy for recurrent CDAD.

Continuous surveillance of CA-MRSA organised by the French National Reference Center for Staphylococci has revealed a number of significant trends enumerated below:\n\u2022The spread of previously continent-specific clones of CA-MRSA to other continents. Schematically in 2003, ST80 was detected in Europe, ST8 (USA300) and ST1 (USA400) in the USA, and ST30 in Oceania. In 2006, intercontinental exchanges of several clones were observed: the ST8 clone from the USA towards Europe; the ST1 clone from the USA towards Europe and Asia; the ST59 clone (USA1000) from the USA towards Asia; and the ST80 clone from Europe towards Asia.\u2022The spread of PVL-positive CA-MRSA from country to country. For instance, in Europe, PVL-positive CA-MRSA of ST80 was recently detected in Slovenia, Romania, and Croatia.\u2022New PVL-positive CA-MRSA clones emerging with different genetic backgrounds. While most of the clones described in 2003 had an agr3 background, the newly described clones are agr1 or agr2. Clone ST22 (agr1) has been found in Europe only, and clone ST377 (agr1 with a type V SCCmec) was reported simultaneously in Europe and Australia.\u2022PVL-positive CA-MRSA, which were initially susceptible to most anti-staphylococcal agents, have acquired new antimicrobial resistance determinants, for example, to gentamicin and ofloxacin.\u2022In contrast to the USA, where CA-MRSA now accounts for the majority of S. aureus infections in the community, the prevalence of PVL-positive CA-MRSA remains low in Northern Europe. However, Southern European countries, such as Greece, and countries located at the southern boundaries of Europe, such as Algeria, have a greater prevalence of PVL-positive CA-MRSA.\u2022In countries of high prevalence, PVL-positive CA-MRSA are responsible for an increasing number of hospital-acquired infections.\u2022Sequence variations of PVL among the different clones have been observed. The most frequently observed clone in Europe (ST80) harbours an H2 haplotype which is described as the ancestral allele that gave rise to the other variants.\n",

In the United States (U.S.), the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System reported a 12% increase in MRSA infections in 2003, compared with the prevalence noted from 1998 to 2002. Now >63% of all S. aureus isolates recovered from critically ill patients are MRSA and are prevalent in all regions of the U.S. Additionally, MRSA now represents a worldwide problem, with the pathogen increasingly noted in Europe and Asia. Initially, infections with this organism were seen almost exclusively in people with significant healthcare exposure. The first reports of MRSA infections among healthy persons without identifiable risk factors for HA infections were published in the 1980s. MRSA emerged as a more widespread cause of community-associated (CA) infections in the late 1990s. A comparison of CA-MRSA versus HA-MRSA reported that skin and soft tissue and otitis media infections were disproportionately due to CA-MRSA, compared with respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. However, there has been a dramatic increase in the occurrence of S. aureus infections in general and CA-MRSA infections in particular. In most, but not all, U.S. cities, CA-MRSA is now the most common pathogen cultured from patients with skin and soft tissue infections in emergency departments. Epidemic community-associated MRSA disease has also been reported from some rural areas. In Canada, a similar pattern of emergence is occurring with the West Coast being most affected. Of concern is the risk of greater incidence of community-acquired pneumonias caused by MRSA in the future. Although severe pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA was reported in children soon after this pathogen emerged in the U.S., reports in adults have been rare and typically associated with influenza virus infection. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 10 cases of severe MRSA CAP in 2006; six of the 10 patients died. Although a small sampling of patients, these cases nonetheless underscore the need for healthcare providers to be extremely vigilant for cases of severe CAP caused by MRSA.",

However, vancomycin treatment failure is not uncommon, even when MRSA strains are fully susceptible to vancomycin (MIC \u2264 2 \u03bcg/mL). A reduction in the efficacy of vancomycin against MRSA strains with a high vancomycin MIC (1\u20132 \u03bcg/mL) has been described in observational studies with low number of patients, suggesting that subtle changes in the MIC may explain clinical failures.

Nevertheless and in parallel, an increase in MRSA isolates in the community setting, including nursing homes and healthcare-associated facilities, has been observed during the past decade.

Thus, the consequences of the infection are more severe in non-immune women than in those who have acquired a certain level of antimalarial immunity. In highly endemic areas, the frequency and severity of the infection is higher in primigravidae and decreases with increasing parity.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), one of the two most widespread, prevalent and medically significant vector-borne diseases in Europe, will be presented as a case study. Epidemiological data at fine temporal and spatial resolution record major upsurges in incidence over recent decades. The timing, degree and abruptness of these upsurges differ markedly between countries, and even between districts within countries. A significant discontinuity in temperature conditions in 1989 across Europe could have created a generally more permissive environment for TBE virus transmission by improving the circumstances necessary for larval and nymphal stages of the tick to co-feed on rodents. The pattern of climate change, however, is too uniform within and between countries to provide the sole, or even the most important, explanation for the extreme spatio-temporal heterogeneity in TBE epidemiology. Instead, a nexus of interacting factors affecting both the risk of infection and exposure of humans to that risk, and each differing in force in space and time, is a more powerful model. Analysis of the situation in Central and Eastern Europe has established that many of these factors were driven by the socio-economic changes associated with the end of Soviet rule, and include climate, land cover, land use, wildlife, agricultural practices, industrial activities, (un)employment and income. Western and Nordic Europe must be incorporated to achieve a coherent pan-European explanation. The same principles may apply to the periodic epidemics of Crimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever.",

VZV DNA was detected in 4% of neurons from human trigeminal ganglia at autopsy with a median of 7 viral genomes per positive neuron. Latent VZV DNA was rarely, if ever, detected in nonneuronal cells. The virus can reactivate from latently infected ganglia to cause shingles. The varicella vaccine virus may also reactivate and cause shingles, especially in immunocompromised patients. We have used PCR to detect VZV DNA in the blood of immunocompromised patients who present with abdominal pain in the absence of a rash, to allow early therapy prior to development of the rash of shingles. At least six VZV genes (genes 4, 21, 29, 62, 63, and 66) are expressed in latently infected ganglia in humans. We have constructed VZV mutants lacking five of these genes and found that three of the genes are essential for replication in cell culture, one is important for efficient replication, and one is dispensable for replication. Mutations in the coding region of one of the latency genes (gene 63) resulted in impairment in replication in vitro and a marked reduction in latency in rodents. Replacement of the native promoter for one of the latency genes (gene 29), with the major immediate-early cytomegalovirus promoter, resulted in a virus that replicated to levels comparable to wild-type virus, but the virus was impaired for latency in rodents. These studies suggest that changes in the coding or promoter region of latency genes in VZV might serve as useful vaccine candidates. Such vaccines might be less likely to establish latency and reactivate in humans, and may be especially useful in immunocompromised patients.",

            "text": "Many bacteria use a form of cell-cell signaling termed quorum sensing to coordinate gene expression as a function of the population density. Quorum sensing enables bacteria to coordinate population-wide responses that play a crucial role in virulence. Complex quorum sensing networks enable bacteria to detect signals that provide information regarding the number of individuals in the population, the different species of bacteria present in the community, and additional inputs, such as environmental and metabolic signals. Recently, it has become clear that small non-coding RNAs (sRNA) are often the central regulators modulating gene expression at central steps of quorum sensing cascades and therefore coordinate the complex networks that control virulence in bacteria. Importantly, multiple functionally redundant sRNAs act together at the same key step of these regulatory cascades. These different sRNAs are differentially expressed and respond to different signals and thus provide a mechanism of integrating different environmental stimuli and translating the combined information into the appropriate output. We study a quorum sensing signal named autoinducer (AI-2), which unlike most quorum sensing signals, it is not species-specific. AI-2 is produced and detected by a wide variety of bacteria and allows interspecies communication. By studying interspecies signalling in consortia we found that Escherichia coli can manipulate AI-2 signalling in organisms such as the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae and interfere with other species' ability to regulate virulence. Here we show that in this enteric bacterium the AI-2 synthase, LuxS, is regulated by a sRNA.",

The serums and a cardiac valve tissue were used for direct DNA purification. The flagellin gene was chosen as a target for analysis. The PCR primer set for amplification of fla gene from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb SL) complex was used. The direct sequence of amplicon indicated the presence of different sequences.

In silico RFLP analysis with 5 restriction endonucleases was conducted. \u201cVirtual\u201d hybridisation with the probes designed for the detection of Bb SL and specie-specific probes were used. The Maximum Parsimony heuristic search was performed in PAUP by implementing the tree-bisection-reconnection algorithm. Alignment was 488 characters long, 53 of them were parsimony informative.

Until recently it was thought that only 3 genospecies, firmly established and well accepted, might cause Lyme disease (LD), i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii. However, few other genospecies have also been connected to LD or were isolated from humans with LD symptoms. They are B. bissettii and B. spielmanii. After the first isolation of B. bissettii from the 9 samples of human origin in Slovenia, our results are the second evidence of involvement of B. bissettii in LD in Europe. The presence of B. bissettii as a single strain in humans with symptomatic borreliosis or chronic borrelial infection is the strong support of the fact that B. bissettii is not only the member of the LD complex, but is a causative agent of the disease.",

In addition to a large group of highly diverse strains related to Borrelia bissettii, and another, rather homogenous group of strains that represent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, a group of 16 isolates with unusual characteristics was found. All 16 isolates were cultured from ear biopsies of the rodents Peromyscus gossypinus and Neotoma floridana, the main reservoir hosts of Borrelia in the southern US. The rodents were trapped in 5 different localities of South Carolina from September 1994 till August 1997. The new methodology of multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) that involved the study of rrf-rrl intergenic spacer region, rrs (16S rRNA) gene, flagellin gene, ospA gene and p66 gene, was used to clarify the taxonomic status of this new highly homogenous group of South Carolina isolates. All 13 recognised species of B. burgdorferi sl complex were used as controls. The association of this species with the Lyme disease group was confirmed by multiple results of MLSA. The virtual hybridisation of the rrf-rrl spacer region, flagellin gene, ospA gene with the probes previously described, and experimentally used among these loci for identification of B. burgdorferi sl species showed 100% identity. Unique RFLP patterns were discovered in the rrf-rrl intergenic spacer region and flagellin gene of these South Carolina isolates. Unique signature nucleotides were allocated in the 16S rRNA gene. The Maximum Parsimony heuristic search was performed in PAUP by implementing the tree-bisection-reconnection algorithm for all 5 loci. Phylogenetic analysis shows that each of the main species of the B. burgdorferi sl complex forms a coherent cluster. All sequences from the 16 South Carolina isolates were clustered together and separately from the other species in the B. burgdorferi sl complex. Contrary to dogma, B. burgdorferi sl is present and widely distributed in the southern US. It occurs in many parts where it was not previously thought to occur. A substantial amount of additional results highly support the designation of a new B. burgdorferi sl species from the southern United States. Further analysis of the 16 cultured Borrelia strains from South Carolina is still in progress. The new species will be described formally in another article.",

In the developing world, the problem is even more acute, as respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death in children outside of the neonatal period. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia, sepsis, otitis media, and meningitis and accounts for a significant portion of this mortality. Influenza is also a major contributor, both as a primary infection and by interacting with bacterial pathogens to increase the incidence and severity of pneumonia. While the pneumococcus is the most common secondary pathogen following influenza in typical inter-pandemic years, affecting mainly the young and the frail elderly, Staphylococcus aureus is seen more commonly when highly virulent viral strains circulate, and has been emerging in recent years as a cause of necrotising pneumonia as a co-pathogen with influenza in healthy children and young adults. Our laboratory studies the mechanisms that underlie the interactions between respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The approach we have taken is to isolate specific virulence factors in the virus or bacterium and use genetic approaches to modify or delete them, allowing assessment of their impact in relevant animal models. Certain themes of cooperation between pathogens have emerged from this analysis, giving us insight into specific pathogenic mechanisms and revealing how these differ for different viral-bacterial pairs, or between different strains of one of the pathogens. These findings in the laboratory can then be related back to the epidemiology of co-infections in humans, helping define the challenges we face in moderating morbidity and mortality from these pathogens. The ultimate goal of this work is to apply this knowledge to facilitate treatment and prevention of these common diseases by targeting the cooperative interactions that make co-infections so deadly.",

            "text": "It was recognised during the so-called Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918 that the majority of deaths due to the flu occurred more than 7 days after the onset of symptoms. In the overwhelming majority of cases of pandemic influenza, signs and symptoms resolved by day 6, but in a subgroup with significant mortality, illness worsened in the second week of illness. There is abundant evidence that most of the mortality during the pandemic was due to the combination of influenza plus bacterial super-infection. The most common bacterial cause of death was the pneumococcus, but nosocomial spread of group A streptococci was often lethal, as were staphylcocccal infections. Up to 50% of young soldiers' deaths due to influenza in 1918 were complicated by bacteraemia. While antibiotics were not available in 1918, it is naive to believe that antibiotics will reliably save individuals suffering from the cytokine storm of pandemic influenza and simultaneous bacteraemia. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered, but as progression to pneumonia may be impossible to predict, the amount of antibiotic needed to be given will be considerable (to all those infected with influenza). An additional approach to reduce mortality is vaccination \u2013 vaccination against the pandemic influenza strain will be the first priority if such a vaccine is available. Vaccines are currently however available to prevent pneumococcal infection. Data from a randomised trial of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) show that children immunised with PCV have 45% less hospitalisation for pneumonia due to endemic influenza. The 23 valent pneumococcal vaccine (23v) is highly protective against bacteraemia when given to healthy young adults. Widespread PCV administration to children including a booster dose in the second year of life is essential to ensure their protection plus the best chance of herd immunity to the PCV types in the older population. Healthcare workers, military personel and other first responders should receive the 23v vaccine when the pandemic threat level reaches level 5. Attempts should be made at that time to also strengthen existing recommendations to immunise at risk and elderly persons with the 23v vaccine. Pandemic influenza plans at present fail to recognise the potentially essential role of pneumococcal vaccine in the prevention of mortality from pandemic influenza.",

Positive culture establishes the diagnosis of IFI and influences therapeutic options either through susceptibility testing or via accurate characterisation of mould isolates with inherent resistance to amphotericin B-eg. Scedosporium spp., A. terreus or A. nidulans. Microscopy of histological specimens, using fungal-specific stains, like Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) complemented with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) can reveal fungal elements and tissue-fungus cellular interactions. Also, direct microscopy of wet potassium hydroxide mounts of biological fluids, and fluorescent microscopy with Calcofluor white, Uvitex 2B or Blankophor P, of either fresh clinical specimens, such as BAL and corneal specimens or paraffin-embedded tissue, provide rapid results on presence/absence of fungal elements. Although positive histology and direct microscopy are non-specific tests, since sporogenous structures are typically absent in human material, they nonetheless give a fast diagnostic clue to the presence of regularly or irregularly, septate, aseptate or rarely septate hyphae, dictate use of selective media for culture and justify administration of antifungal therapy. Furthermore, culture-based identification by morphological and physiological criteria is complex. In many taxa definitive phenotypic features are difficult to observe or are highly variable. Besides, most clinical isolates lack a sexual cycle and for many pathogens the concept of a species is still poorly defined.

Ten studies presented all harms, 23 presented only AEs attributed to study drugs and nine studies did not specify any information regarding AE attribution. Clinical AEs were reported with the following severity grades: 14 studies reported severity grades of 1\u20134, 16 studies 2\u20134, 10 studies 3\u20134 and two studies reported only AEs that led to discontinuation. Twenty seven studies reported AE that occurred only above a threshold. Eight studies reported AEs that occurred in more than 5% of the patients, 4 above 10%, 2 above 15% and one above 20%. Moreover, three studies reported selected AE without details of how or why the selection was done. Of the 42 studies, 14 were academic and 28 were sponsored by a pharmaceutical company.
