In addition, these patients may have COVID-19 and/or other infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza and including fever or respiratory symptoms of unknown origin. As a result, the risk of cross infection among these outpatients is extremely high. Thus, there is an urgent need for a reasonable patient screening and clearance process in the outpatient department.",

First of all, we have strengthened the pre-examination and triage process. The attending physicians (or higher-status physicians) with rich experience in infectious diseases mainly take charge of screening patients, ensuring the accuracy of different triage procedures. Normally, however, the triage position is usually conducted by only 1 or 2 nurses. Second, after triage, patients are sent to the general clinic or the fever clinic according to their epidemiological history and clinical characteristics. The fever clinic is divided into 3 areas: (1) COVID-19 screening area for patients with suspected or identified COVID-19; (2) the common fever screening area, including patients with fever other than suspected COVID-19 or other respiratory diseases; and (3) the pediatric non\u2013COVID-19 with fever screening area. These 3 areas are strictly separated, which can effectively prevent cross-infection among patients. Third, a consultation team consisting of doctors from the infectious disease, respiratory, and imaging departments has been implemented for timely consultation and screening of patients suspected to have COVID-19. Last but not least, healthcare workers are required to do a good job of self-protection, and we have optimized the distribution of personal protective equipment.",
