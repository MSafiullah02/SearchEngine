From this total, 57.68% (n=6,082) were men (Table 1) . Hypertension was the most prevalent morbidity (21.74%), followed by obesity (20.05%) and diabetes (17.65%). It can be seen that the prevalence and number of morbidities increased as age did. From the general population, 55.61% (n=5797) had no comorbidities. The most frequent combination of chronic diseases was diabetes and hypertension (6.05%). This combination is followed by hypertension and obesity (3.75%), Diabetes and Hypertension and Obesity (3.06%), and diabetes and obesity (2.2%). Obesity in combination with hypertension (5.41%) and diabetes (3.01%) was more frequent in individuals from 50-74 years. Obesity alone was more frequent (13.4%) in the 25-49 age group. From the total number of COVID-19 cases, 28.68% developed pneumonia, that was more frequent in individuals over 50 years (61.14% of the total cases), and 37.91% were hospitalised, mainly individuals over 50 years (59.79%). Hospitalisation, intubation, and intensive care unit admission were more frequent in the older age groups. From the total individuals 968 (9.18%) died. It can be seen that deaths increased as age did, with the higher percentage in the older age group. Death was presented in 9.18% of the total number of cases, 0.84% in individuals under 25 years, 4.52% in the 25-49 years group, 14.99% in people between 50 and 74, and 27.95% for the older age group. The mean of days from the symptomatology presentation to the admission was 4.32\u00b13.39 days, from the admission to the dead 5.88\u00b14.95 days, and from the symptomatology presentation to the dead 10.08\u00b15.47 days. The health ministry services (SSA, 48.44%) and the Mexican Institute of Social Services (IMSS, 34.47%) were the institutions that attended the largest number of cases (Table 1) .
