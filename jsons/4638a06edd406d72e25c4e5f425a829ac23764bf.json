In order to identify viral genomes in any given biological sample, it is necessary to use methods that exclude cellular nucleic acids, which are the most abundant nucleic acids in most samples. The approach described here is based on physical separation of viral and cellular nucleic acids, followed by non-specific amplification of the purified viral nucleic acids. Encapsidation of viral nucleic acids is used as a basis for separation of viral nucleic acids from cellular nucleic acids. Viral capsids protect viral nucleic acids from digestion by nucleases, and also provide viral nucleic acids with a density that permits capsids to be separated from other cellular debris, including nucleic acids (Denniston et al., 1981) . After purification of viral capsids, viral DNA and RNA are extracted (separately, in order to preserve an indication of whether a viral genome is DNA or RNA) and RNA is copied into cDNA by reverse transcription. Samples are then amplified using a non-specific DOP-PCR assay that is designed to amplify at least a portion of any viral genome. This report discusses this method and an evaluation of its sensitivity to detect viruses spiked into cell culture, present during acute infection of cell culture, or expressed constitutively in cell culture.",

DOP-PCR primer populations were designed with a short (four to six nucleotide) 3 -anchor sequence (which allows the primers to bind in consistent locations), preceded by a non-specific degenerate sequence (of six to eight nucleotides in these experiments). Immediately upstream of the non-specific degenerate sequence, each primer also contained a defined 5 -sequence of 10 nucleotides in length ( Table 1 ). The sequence of the primer population used in most of the experiments reported in this manuscript was 5 -CCGACTCGAGINNNNNNTGTGG-3 , where N refers to an equimolar representation of all four deoxyribonucleotides, I refers to inosine, the underlined nucleotides correspond to the 3 -anchor sequence, and the italicized nucleotides correspond to the degenerate sequence. Because of the six Ns in each degenerate sequence, each reaction included a mixture of 4096 different primers. The PCR cycling program used in these experiments was: Initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 \u2022 C, followed by 5 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u2022 C, 1.5 min at 30 \u2022 C, slow ramping to 72 \u2022 C at 0.2 \u2022 C/s, and 3 min extension at 72 \u2022 C. This was then followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u2022 C, 1 min at 55 \u2022 C, and 2 min extension at 72 \u2022 C, with the addition of 14 s per cycle to the extension step. Amplifications were performed on a BioMetra TGradient thermocycler (Biometra, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). The PCR reaction contained 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.4, 200 M dNTP, 2.4 M DOP primer and 2.5 U low-DNA Taq (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA).",

            "text": "Efficient amplification of viral genomes is generally not feasible when a 3 -anchor sequence of 6 nucleotides is used, because such a sequence appears only (on average) once every 4096 nucleotides, leading to a sensitivity of only 10 6 copies of the SV40 genome (Table 1 , primer #1). Thus, to adapt this method for amplification of viral genomes, primers with shorter 3 -anchor sequences were designed and tested (Table 1) . Primer qualifying experiments were carried out using a 10-fold dilution series of the 5.2 kb SV40 genome, in order to compare the sensitivity of different primer populations. These experiments focused on variations of 3 -anchor sequences TGTGG (primer #s 2-12) and TTCTG (primer #s 14-17), to increase the number of locations at which an anchor sequence is likely to bind to viral nucleic acid. Inosines were added at different locations of the degenerate portion of the primers in an effort to further improve binding at the 3 end of the primer (primer #s 2-17). In experiments using a 3 -anchor sequence of four nucleotides (primer #s 3-6, 8, 9, 11, 14-17) , sensitivity to detect DNA templates was reduced, probably because the primer length that matched the DNA template at its 3 end was too short (even when combined with the 6-nucleotide degenerate sequence or with additional inosines). Sequencing of DOP-PCR products and comparison with original template sequences revealed that this method typically amplifies genome fragments that match the 3 -anchor sequence on opposite strands at both ends (with occasional mismatches), and that nucleotide matches upstream of the degenerate sequence are not required for efficient amplification (with only random [a median of 2 matches in the original viral sequence out of ten nucleotides] typically observed in this region, regardless of template). Use of different 10-nucleotide sequences did not influence sensitivity (primer #s 13 and 14), further supporting the conclusion that the 5 -sequence does not play a role in DOP-PCR primer sensitivity. The best sensitivity was obtained with a 5-nucleotide 3 -anchor sequence, in combination with one additional inosine inserted upstream of the degenerate sequence (primer #2). Consequently, an optimized primer population with these features was used in the virus detection experiments described in this manuscript. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the ability of the optimized DOP-PCR primer (5 -CCGACTCGAGINNNNNNTGTGG-3 ) and that of adapter ligation PCR (Allander et al., 2001) to amplify a 10-fold dilution series (in water) of full-length 152 kb HSV-2 and 5.2 kb SV40 genomic DNA. Quantities of viral DNA ranging from 10 9 (for HSV-2) or 10 10 (for SV40) copies to 10 2 copies (genome copy numbers were based on spectrophotometric readings of viral nucleic acids extracted directly from gradient-purified viral capsids) were subjected to amplification, and the DOP-PCR detected 100 copies of SV40 DNA and 1000 copies of HSV-2 DNA in these reactions (Fig. 1,  top panels) . Adapter ligation PCR (Fig. 1 , lower panels) detected 10 9 Fig. 2 . Detection of SV40 viral genome after capsid preparation using real-time PCR and DOP-PCR. Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus stock (measured in PFU) were mixed with 10 6 Vero cells and examined both prior to and after capsid preparation. The SV40 viral nucleic acid was extracted from the viral capsids and 1/10 of the DNA was used as template for amplified using real-time and DOP-PCR in parallel. Detected quantities of viral nucleic acid are shown for each original sample. DOP-PCR results (+ or \u2212) are shown at the top of the graph. copies (but not lower quantities) of both viral DNAs, implying a substantial advantage to amplification of viral genomes by DOP-PCR. PCR-amplified bands from both DOP-PCR and adapter ligation PCR were confirmed to be from the original viruses by gel-purification, cloning and sequencing. Analysis of sequences obtained from SISPA of 10 9 genome equivalents of SV40 revealed that approximately 55% of the genome was detected. Sequences ranged from 300 to 800 bp; sequences from theoretical SISPA amplicons outside of this size range were not identified in this experiment, accounting for the approximately 45% of the genome that was not obtained.",

The real-time PCR studies revealed that the original samples contained two to three logs more DNA copies than PFUs, and that the capsid preparation yielded a viral DNA copy number about one to one and a half logs higher than the number of PFU spiked into the Vero cells. These results imply a high efficiency of capsid preparation and nucleic acid extraction. Because a PFU in culture often represents an aggregation of viruses, it was not surprising to detect more DNA copies than PFU. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1 , the DOP-PCR detected SV40 in samples spiked with 100 PFU of virus, which by real-time PCR corresponded to approximately 5 \u00d7 10 3 virus genomes after capsid purification.

All discrete bands were gel-purified from lanes 1, 3, 5 and 6, cloned, sequenced and compared with sequences in GenBank. For each virus, sequences obtained from each band matched with that of the original virus, and the original virus sequence revealed the presence of the anchor sequence (TGTGG) on both strands flanking the obtained sequences. In addition, experimental results showed the same banding pattern each time a virus was studied. Table 2 summarizes experiments using this method to detect the DNA viruses VZV, SV40, and AAV, and the RNA viruses polio virus and influenza virus.

Many clinical samples might contain a small proportion of infected cells, against a background of infected cells. Thus, it was of interest to study further the sensitivity to detect infectious viruses growing in cell culture in controlled samples, in this context. Detection limits for viruses in cells infected acutely or persistently after dilution into uninfected Vero cells were examined (Table 3 ). In these experiments, quantities ranging from 10 1 to 10 6 infected cells were added to uninfected Vero cells to a total of 10 6 cells. The method was able to detect HSV-1 or Sabin strain (type 2) poliovirus from 1000 (or more) infected Vero cells against a background of 10 6 total cells. EBV was successfully detected in samples containing 1000 or more 1A2 cells against a background of 10 6 uninfected Vero cells. These data indicate that DOP-PCR can detect HSV, EBV, or poliovirus when approximately one cell per thousand is infected. The sensitivity for detection of infectious HTLV-2 appeared to be lower, but the method detected HTLV-2 sequences in 10 5 Mo T cells against a background of 10 6 total cells.",

This nonspecific approach to amplifying viral nucleic acids was several logs more sensitive than a non-specific amplification method described previously, implying a significant advance. A variety of DNA and RNA viruses were detected non-specifically in test samples designed to mimic detection problems that involve virus particles against a background of cellular nucleic acids. Previous studies reported viral detection methods based upon nuclease digestion of biological samples. The main difference between those and the approach presented in the current study lies in the amplification schemes. In one of the previous studies (in which a new bovine parvovirus was detected in serum), PCR primers were ligated to purified viral nucleic acids after digestion with a restriction endonuclease (SISPA) (Allander et al., 2001) . The same scheme was also used to identify a new human parvovirus and to isolate new strains of human TTV (Jones et al., 2005) . This approach is most suitable for detection of DNA viruses because digestion with a restriction endonuclease of cDNAs reverse-transcribed from RNA viruses would require second-strand synthesis from cDNA, which is known to be an inefficient process.",

Because non-encapsidated viral nucleic acid is removed in the process of purification and thus not amplified, some potential sensitivity is lost. The ratio between infectious virions and total virus nucleic acid may vary for different viruses and is determined not only by viral but also by host factors. In samples with low PFU to nucleic acid ratios, capsid purification could substantially reduce the ability to detect viral nucleic acids. However, in the SV40 experiment (Fig. 2) , capsid purification yielded a 3-log improvement in DOP-PCR assay sensitivity, while reducing total viral DNA by approximately one log. Although it seems likely that the purification techniques described above would be applicable to other types of samples, caution should be used in extrapolating these results to samples that may have higher PFU to nucleic acid ratios, or that may be more complex and thus interfere either with the capsid purification or the DOP-PCR. Additional validation of the capsid purification may thus be necessary to extend this method to other sample types.",

Another advantage is the lack of need for a matched negative control (to perform molecular subtractions). A third advantage is the ability to handle very large samples; the elimination of cellular nucleic acids permits the concentration of viral nucleic acids to levels that would not be possible if cellular nucleic acids were retained. This advantage mitigates the somewhat reduced sensitivity of DOP-PCR relative to traditional PCRs, and also can compensate for the potential loss of non-encapsidated viral nucleic acid during the capsid preparation.",

PCR-assays using such primers were found to be sensitive (able to detect as few as 100 copies of viral nucleic acid for large virus genomes, and 100-1000 copies of viral nucleic acid for small genomes). The specific 3 -anchor sequence of the primer population led to a reproducible amplification pattern for each virus. Thus, the pattern of bands observed in DOP-PCR may provide some preliminary clues to the virus sequences present in a sample. When contaminating cellular nucleic acids are incompletely degraded (while the virus nucleic acids are still protected by the capsid), we hypothesize that the use of a 3 -anchor sequence may minimize the random amplification of very small cellular sequences (which are seldom long enough to contain two copies of the 3 -anchor sequence on opposite strands), helping to explain the absence of cellular nucleic acid amplification in the assay.",

While specific PCRs result in false positives only if contaminating sequences that share significant homology with the used primers are present, false positive DOP-PCR products could stem from every conceivable form of nucleic acid contamination. Such contamination could not only cause delays in detection and more sequencing but could also camouflage virus sequences. In some early experiments, spurious sequences were detected due to reagent contamination with small amounts of bacterial, fungal, or algal nucleic acids, sometimes caused by residual contaminants in polymerases. However, the use of low-DNA Taq polymerase, and careful attention to the quality of other reagents minimized these problems.",

Although implementation of the DOP-PCR for tissue or environmental samples will require additional work and validation, this assay is able to detect viruses of very different natures, including enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, viruses with DNA or RNA genomes, with small or large genomes, and even a segmented genome, without any specific prior knowledge regarding the sequence of the genome.
