Patients with haematological and other cancers, 1,2 and recipients of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), could be at particular risk from COVID-19, since they tend to be older, have multiple comorbidities, and are often immunosuppressed by their disease or therapy. A retrospective analysis of 355 patients who died of COVID-19 in Italy showed that 20% had active cancer, 3 and a study from 2013-17 of 678 patients who had an HSCT found that 112 (17%) developed human coronavirus infection, of whom 34 had lower respiratory tract infection. 4 However, evidence regarding the effect of COVID-19 on patients with cancer is inadequate.",

Travel restrictions, patient concerns, regulatory guidance, and sequestering of oncology staff have resulted in many cancer outpatient visits being replaced by telephone consultation, and deferral of some routine therapy, tests, and procedures.",

Investigators, government agencies, and professional societies have provided initial experiences and guidance on managing the continued care of patients with cancer during the current period of crisis. 5 Routine visits should be done via telephone or rescheduled, oral medications should be delivered to the patient's home to cover the peak period of the pandemic, and biological samples should be collected and processed at a local facility near the patient's residence. Cancer multidisciplinary team meetings should be done via a virtual platform, and changes should be made to individual treatment plans as needed for the duration of the pandemic.",

            "text": "Patients with leukaemia, lymphoma, or myeloma; those receiving radical radiotherapy for lung cancer, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, antibodies, protein kinase inhibitors, or poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors; and those with recent bone marrow or stem cell transplants could be especially vulnerable to COVID-19. 5 The European Society of Medical Oncology and National Health Service England have suggested a tiered approach for categorising patients into different priorities for receiving active cancer therapy during the pandemic. 5 Higher priority should be given if the patient's condition is immediately life threatening or clinically unstable, or the intervention is expected to result in substantial overall survival gain or improvement of quality of life. Oncologists should consider changing intravenous treatments to subcutaneous or oral routes, using longer intervals between immunotherapy regimens, deferring nonurgent supportive therapies, using granulocytecolony stimulating factor as primary prophylaxis, and discussing treatment breaks for patients on long-term therapy. 5 Radiation treatment should be prioritised for patients with rapidly proliferating tumours and those whose planned radiotherapy has already begun, and hypofractionation should be considered to shorten the treatment duration. Patients with cancer who develop COVID-19 should be treated in the respiratory or intensive care units rather than in the oncology or radiotherapy units. 2 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious and disruptive effect on the conduct of haematology and oncology clinical trials, with both immediate and delayed consequences. In the short term, research staff and resources have been reassigned to manage the rush of patients with COVID-19 at many academic institutions and participating hospitals, and routine clinical research activities have been suspended. Trials testing treatments for COVID-19 have been prioritised. Research-related appointments to hospitals for site Sputnik/Science Photo Library selection or qualification, source data verification, drug accountability, audit, and site staff training by contract research organisations (CROs) and sponsors have been cancelled because of travel restrictions. A sharp reduction in recruitment to ongoing trials and a delay in the planned launch of new haematology and oncology studies might be expected during the peak of the pandemic. A delay can also be anticipated in data entry into clinical trial databases owing to study coordinators working remotely with reduced access to the source data. As hospital radiology departments and laboratories are stretched during the pandemic, and to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to trial subjects, some protocol-mandated visits and study procedures, such as tumour assessments and biopsies, have been delayed or cancelled. A delay in imaging will impact progression-free endpoints of ongoing studies, while quality of life endpoints will be affected if patients miss study visits. Most regulatory authorities require that COVID-19 infection and related (serious) adverse events, such as dyspnoea and acute respiratory distress syndrome, be specifically captured and reported. 6 Site staff and monitors will need to be trained in this regard.",

COVID-19-related deaths could potentially affect survival endpoints in some studies.

[8] [9] [10] Ensuring patient safety during the pandemic is of utmost priority. Training courses on COVID-19 symptoms, management, and use of personal protective equipment should be implemented. A phone contact with the trial participant should be made the day before the planned visit, to enquire if they have any COVID-19 symptoms. Hospital access should be restricted for vendors, visitors, trial monitors, and auditors. Virtual support services should be implemented for trial participants, and where feasible, remote access to relevant medical charts should be granted to trial monitors to review, verify, and raise queries. Such systems should have robust security and audit trails. Several CROs are responding to this new reality by adapting their usual processes and developing new methods of remote, secure trial monitoring, site staff training, drug accountability, and source data verification and review, while recognising and respecting the disparities in national legislation in different countries with regard to remote access to medical records by CROs and direct shipment of medication to patients.",

For some investigational products, such as oral medications typically distributed for self-administration, alternative safe delivery methods should be implemented to avoid hospital visits by patients. The implementation of such alternative processes should be as consistent with the protocol as possible, and sponsors and clinical investigators should document the reasons for any contingency measures adopted. Sponsors and clinical investigators should clearly document how restrictions related to COVID-19 led to the changes in study conduct, the duration of those changes, and which trial participants were affected and how. Since radiology services are likely to be stretched during the pandemic, central imaging review should be instituted to ensure good quality of data for clinical trial patients.",
