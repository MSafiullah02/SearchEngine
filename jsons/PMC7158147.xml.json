It can be spread by bites from virus-infected mosquitoes, similar to dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus in the same family. In recent years, the outbreak of ZV in tropical and subtropical regions has become a major public health issue [1, 2]. Infection of ZV results in a self-limiting mild illness characterized by rash, fever, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and arthritis [3]. Recently, evidence has indicated that ZV infection can be correlated with the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [4]. In addition, the isolation of ZV from the fetal brain and epidemiological information provide strong evidence that ZV infection is associated with microcephaly [5, 6]. At present, there are no specific curative treatments for ZV infection or approved vaccines to prevent ZV infection. Therefore, it is very important to develop a therapeutic approach or vaccine for ZV infection.",

            "text": "The emergence of ZV in different regions of the world has created an urgent need for vaccines against ZV [7, 8]. ZV is in the same viral family as dengue virus. It has been shown that the structure of mature ZV is arranged in a herringbone pattern with 90 antiparallel envelope dimers [9, 10], similar to the structure of dengue virus [11, 12]. The dengue virus envelope protein contains three domains. This viral structural protein plays a key role in viral entry. Envelope protein domain III (E3) of dengue virus contains an immunoglobulin-like fold and contributes to viral attachment [13, 14]. Our previous studies have shown that E3 of dengue virus is a potential dengue vaccine candidate [15\u201323]. It is very likely that antibodies against ZV E3 can neutralize ZV infection. Recently, ZV-derived E3 [24, 25], ZV-derived E3 displayed on immunogenic virus-like particles [26, 27], or ZV-derived E3 fused with the Fc region of human IgG [28] was found to induce neutralizing immune responses against ZV when formulated with adjuvants. The neutralizing immunogenicity on neutralizing epitopes was further enhanced by masking of a non-neutralizing epitope surrounding residue 375 of ZV E3 [29]. Characterization of the human immune response to ZV infection revealed that the highly cross-reactive antibodies to envelope protein domain I/II induced by ZV or DV infection were poorly neutralizing but potently enhancing may pose a risk for heterologous ADE [30]. Thus, ZV E3 is a potential target for ZV vaccine development.",

It has been shown that both synthetic lipopeptides and bacterial-derived lipoproteins are able to stimulate antigen-presenting cells through the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and thus enhance immune responses [31\u201333]. According to these findings, we developed a technique for producing recombinant lipoproteins with high yields and applied this technology to the development of recombinant protein-based vaccines with superior immunogenicity [34]. In this study, we produced recombinant lipidated ZV E3 (rLZE3) and evaluated the potential of rLZE3 as a vaccine candidate against ZV. We demonstrated that rLZE3 alone stimulated durable neutralizing antibody responses and produced protective effects. Our results provide valuable evidence to move the rLZE3 vaccine candidate into clinical studies in the future.",

The majority of rZE3 was present in the inclusion bodies. rZE3 was extracted with an extraction buffer [0.02 M Tris (pH 8.0), 0.05 M sucrose, 0.5 M NaCl, 10% glycerol and 3 M GuHCl]. For purification of rZE3, the solubilized portion was loaded onto immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) columns (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany). The eluate from the IMAC column was further refined using an anion exchange column (Ni-NTA super flow; slurry). To eliminate endotoxin, the refined fraction was passed through an E membrane (Pall Co., USA). The levels of endotoxin in the purified rZE3 fraction were evaluated by a Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Cape Cod, MA). The residual endotoxin concentration was less than 10 EU/mg. After elimination of endotoxin, rZE3 was dialyzed against 0.01 M dibasic sodium phosphate, lyophilized and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C.

The functionality of the rLZE3 lipid moiety was evaluated by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with rZE3 or rLZE3. The expression levels of CD40 and CD80 on the bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were examined by flow cytometry. rLZE3 increased the CD40 and CD80 expression levels, while rZE3 (without lipidation) did not enhance CD40 and CD80 expression (Fig. 2a). In addition, we added polymyxin B to the stimulation to eliminate the effect of any minor residual endotoxin remaining after rZE3 or rLZE3 purification. It was evident that there were no substantial reduction effects of polymyxin B on stimulation with rZE3 or rLZE3. In contrast, adding polymyxin B abolished enhancing effects of LPS. The mean fluorescence intensity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells cultured without stimulation (PBS) was defined as the basal expression level. The relative mean fluorescence intensities from three independent experiments are summarized in Fig. 2b. These results indicate that the lipid moiety of rLZE3 leads to enhancement of the expression of CD40 and CD80. Furthermore, rLZE3 was able to stimulate the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12p40 by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. In the presence of polymyxin B, the production of cytokines was not eliminated. In contrast, rZE3 (the counterpart of rLZE3 that lacks lipidation) was unable to enhance cytokine production (Fig. 2c). These results support the conclusion that rLZE3 stimulates bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.\n",

In addition, the mice that received the rLZE3-immunized mouse sera exhibited prolonged survival times (Fig. 6b).

We showed that rLZE3 could be readily prepared with an E. coli-based system (Fig. 1) and that immunization with rLZE3 could elicit durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice. Several studies have reported that ZV E3 contains epitopes recognized by strong neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [30, 36\u201339], suggesting that ZV E3 is a potential target that can trigger neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with these findings, our results show that rLZE3 potently induces specific neutralizing antibodies against ZV in mice (Figs. 4b and 5). Notably, we demonstrated that passive transfer of rLZE3-immunized mouse sera reduced viremia levels (Fig. 6a) and prolonged survival times (Fig. 6b) in recipient mice challenged with ZV. Similar observations have been made in other studies [40, 41]. Collectively, these results suggest that neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in providing protective immunity against ZV infection.",

Adjuvants are often required in protein-based subunit vaccine formulations to enhance the antigen-specific immune response. It has been shown that E. coli-produced recombinant lipidated antigens are efficiently captured by dendritic cells [35]. In addition, these recombinant lipidated antigens can also stimulate dendritic cell activation and further enhance antigen-specific immune responses [18\u201320, 34, 35]. In agreement with these findings, our results showed that rLZE3 but not its nonlipidated counterpart could stimulate dendritic cells to increase the expression of CD40 and CD80 (Fig. 2a and b) and enhance the production of cytokines (Fig. 2c). We further demonstrated that mice injected with rLE3 exhibited increased frequencies of not only dendritic cells in the draining lymph node but also antigen-loaded dendritic cells (Fig. 3). All of the above-mentioned features of rLZE3 conferred robust immune responses. As a consequence, rLZE3 alone, without exogenous adjuvant, induced neutralizing antibodies superior to those induced by rZE3. These results suggest that use of a recombinant lipidated antigen is a potent strategy for protein-based subunit vaccine development.",

However, sera from rLZE3-immunized mice did not neutralize DV2 (Fig. 5). It may increase the infection of DV2 in the rLZE3-immunized hosts. To address this issue, we further examined the capacities of sera from rZE3-, rLZE3-, ZV-, and DV2-immunized mice to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DV2 infection. Our results show that ZV- and DV2-immunized sera, but not rZE3- or rLZE3-immunized sera, exhibit great ADE capacities of DV2 infection (Additional file 2: Figure S2). In line with other studies, ZE3-based vaccines formulated with adjuvant elicit neutralizing antibodies and little ADE effects to DV [24\u201327]. Here, we show rLZE3 with intrinsic adjuvant also induces neutralizing antibodies and reduces risk of ADE. These results indicate that rLZE3 is a potential vaccine candidate and superior to whole virion in terms of minimal risk to induce ADE for DV.",
