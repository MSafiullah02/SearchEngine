A T\u2010cell\u2010mediated hypersensitivity was diagnosed in 57 (5.5%) of 1026 children on the basis of positive responses to delayed\u2010reading intradermal tests. Considering these data and the fact that in the study by Caubet et al. 8, children with positive intradermal tests had a higher rate of positive DPT than those without a positive test (p < 0.05), we believe that it is still advisable performing delayed\u2010reading intradermal tests only with the suspect BL at the highest concentration and, in case of negative results, DPTs. In fact, such an approach would allow the physician to diagnose by skin testing those patients with true delayed hypersensitivity, thus reducing the risk of positive DPT.",
