            "text": "Aseptic loosening and hip dislocation remain two of the main complications of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Positioning of acetabular component is a central factor for preventing these complications [1, 2]. Suboptimal placement of the acetabular component in THA can lead to hip instability, impingement, increased wear and reduced range of motion [3]. The conventional methods of using pre-operative radiographs for pre-operative planning and standard surgical instrumentation are not very accurate and depend on surgeon\u2019s experience [4]. In complex primary THA like malunited acetabulum fracture and ankylosed hip, the cup size and placement in correct orientation can be challenging.",

            "text": "Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) techniques are evolving to make surgical procedures more accurate. Although CAS systems improve the accuracy of cup placement [5], they are having drawbacks such as increased operative time, higher cost, increased complexity of the procedure, need to change patient\u2019s position during the procedure and difficult referencing. Recently, rapid prototyped patient-specific guides have been created for cup placement designed from pre-operative computed tomography (CT) scans. Designing patient-specific instrumentation based on patient\u2019s unique bone morphology from CT scan is an improvement over generic instruments by minimizing errors from standard surgical instruments that depend on patient positioning, pelvic orientation, surgical exposure and surgeon\u2019s experience [6, 7]. However, they require removing more soft tissue around acetabular rim, which add to the surgical time and still have challenges to achieve good accuracy.",

The diameter of this sphere represented the cup size. A second sphere of 5 mm larger diameter than the previous sphere was made surrounding the 1st sphere. The second sphere was made hollow using \u201chollow\u201d command with 5 mm rim. It was then trimmed into a ring of 5 mm width which surrounded the acetabular rim. The ring was mirrored to affected side by \u201cmirror\u201d command using mid-plane as reference. The orientation of the ring was checked with respect to inclination and anteversion.

Acetabular osteophytes have to be removed and jig was used after removal of osteophytes. Jig is placed over postero superior aspect of acetabulum with the help of a plate attached to the jig through k wires. Virtual pre-operative planning is done accordingly that plate matches the contour over the posterosuperior aspect of acetabulum and is placed over the desired area fitting the contour and fixed with k wires after removing osteophytes of acetabulum. After its proper seating, ring part of jig surrounds posterosuperior rim of acetabulum for guiding of cup placement.

            "text": "Premature implant failure in total hip arthroplasty requiring revision is a limitation, often resulting from poor implant placement [4, 7, 10\u201314]. The inclination and anteversion of the acetabular component, and the anteversion and the offset of the femoral component are important for longevity in THA because malposition of the components can lead to post-operative limitation of activities of daily living, dislocation wear issues at the articulation, and aseptic loosening [11, 15]. In our study we evaluated accuracy of actebular cup placement guided by 3D printed jig and got an average angle of inclination measured on post-operative x-ray in Group A and Group-B was 43.3\u00b0 and 44\u00b0, respectively, and average angle of anteversion calculated from post-operative x-ray in Group-A and Group-B was 14.2\u00b0 and 13.4\u00b0, respectively, with the difference of cup placement being 0.83\u00b0 \u00b1 1.64\u00b0 for inclination and 0.8\u00b0 \u00b1 3.3\u00b0 for anteversion. James et al. studied the accuracy of acetabular component using computer navigation and found out that the accuracy of cup placement (mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the absolute difference between computer-assisted navigation and CT) was 1.8\u00b0 \u00b1 1.2\u00b0 for inclination and 2.0\u00b0 \u00b1 2.0\u00b0 for anteversion [16]. Ernst et al. did a similar study for evaluation of cup placement by computer navigation assisted technique and found an average inclination of 42.3\u00b0 and an average anteversion of 24.5\u00b0 in the computer-assisted study group and an average inclination of 37.9\u00b0 and an average anteversion of 23.8\u00b0 in the freehand group [17]. Although the accuracy of cup placement increased significantly with the above methods, cost is also increased significantly with the use of this technique. Xiau et al. used iPhone technology in improving acetabular component position in total hip arthroplasty and found the difference in inclination angles using iPhone application compared with the freehand method to be statistically significant in the \u201cuntrained group\u201d suggesting a potential role for iPhone applications in junior surgeons in overcoming the steep learning curve [18]. Nicholas et al. studied positioning of acetabular component using anatomical landmarks (Ilium, superior pubic ramus and superior acetabulum) which used to define a plane allowing orientation of cup in abduction and anteversion on 24 cadaveric acetabulum and 617 primary total hip arthroplasties performed between 1996 and 2003 but it had limitation of being very little useful in dysplastic hips or post acetabular fracture where anatomical landmarks have been distorted [19]. Preoperative planning by reviewing the clinical and radiographic findings of a patient before surgery is standard of care in joint arthroplasty guiding a surgeon through the entire procedure while achieving optimal and reproducible results. Currently, implant placement in THA relies on navigation, crude instrumentation, or exclusively on a surgeon\u2019s intraoperative assessment of limited anatomic landmarks with the use of generic, mechanical instruments designed for all patients with differing severities of pathology and unique anatomy [20]. The most widely used method of placing a cup involves planning the surgery with preoperative radiographs and attempting to reproduce the plan with standard surgical instruments which fail to account for a patient\u2019s unique pelvic anatomy and position on the operating table (OT). Transferring the plan from the radiographs to the OT can be difficult due to a patient\u2019s unique anatomy and the differences defined by Murray between radiographic, operative, and anatomic planes of version and abduction [21]. Surgeon experience using an alignment guide attached to a reamer handle is used to obtain 45\u00b0 abduction referencing the floor and 20\u00b0 anteversion referencing the longitudinal axis of the patient. Assessing the position of the pelvis relative to the patient and the OT using standard instruments can lead to malpositioned acetabular components [20]. For acetabular components, the safe zone for orientation is 15\u00b0 \u00b1 10\u00b0 of anteversion and 40\u00b0 \u00b1 10\u00b0 of inclination [3]. Accurate acetabular cup positioning in THA decreases the risk of dislocation, impingement, and all component wear rate [20, 22, 23]. Defining 3D relationships at the time of surgery for acetabular bone preparation can be difficult, especially when there is significant bone deformity, even by most experienced surgeons.",

The virtual planning also helped us in knowing the altered anatomy like bone loss, locations of osteophytes, depth of acetabulum etc. and hence made us better prepared for surgeries. The acetabular jigs designed in our study for group-A patients were patient specific. Although the placement of jig required a bit more exposure on postero-superior region of acetabulum, its placement was an easy task. Acetabular jig composed of PLA (polylactic acid) can be sterilized by many methods including heat sterilization method either with saturated steam at 125 \u00b0C to 130 \u00b0C for around 20 min or hot air at 160 \u00b0C for 2 h, respectively. Other methods used like gamma irradiation, UV irradiation, ETO (ethylene oxide) are also used but are known to change the property of material. Under standard autoclave, PLA tends to be more brittle rather than deformed and its brittleness increases with number of time it is autoclaved, as experienced in many other studies. We used standard autoclave method and experienced the same. But autoclaving PLA in our study had no deterrent effect in our study as we used it as a guiding jig and was not exposed to any external forces.",

Flordal et al. studied 212 patients undergone total hip replacement surgery and estimated average surgical duration of 89 min [25]. Despite of a good subjective impression of the virtual method, the statistical significance was not reached with respect to the accuracy of cup placement. This may be attributed to the few limitations of our study including small sample size, diverse indications and inhomogeneous level of complexity in both groups. This technique may not be useful in bilateral cases where acetabular landmarks have been distorted. But in cases like bilateral avascular necrosis of femoral head where acetabular landmarks are not distorted, this technique can be useful in bilateral cases. During the course of our study there were some modifications in design of acetabular jig which were mainly of the attachment part which only limited the exposure. Guiding arc of this jig was not changed hence the results of our study were not supposed to be affected by these variations. Although a study with a large sample size with our final jig design is required to obtain more significant results.",
