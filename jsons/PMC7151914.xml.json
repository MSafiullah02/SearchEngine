The nasal mucosa contains ciliated epithelium and mucus-producing cells. Mechanical clearance of entrapped organisms occurs through the nasopharynx via expulsion or swallowing. In the oropharynx, the flow of saliva, sloughing of epithelial cells, local production of complement, and bacterial interference from resident microbiota serve as important factors in local host defense. Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the major immunoglobulin produced in the upper airways and accounts for 10% of the total protein of nasal secretions. It possesses antibacterial and antiviral activity despite being a relatively poor opsonin. Despite some controversy, low IgA levels are probably not associated with increased bacterial infection. IgG and IgM enter the airways predominantly via transudation from the blood. Their roles in bacterial opsonization, complement activation, agglutination, and neutralization activity are similar to those noted in serum.",

This may help to explain why colonization occurs in some clinical settings and not in others. Particles greater than 10 \u00b5m are efficiently filtered by the hair in the anterior nares or impact onto mucosal surfaces because of the configuration of the upper airways and the nasal turbinates. The cough and epiglottic reflexes also keep large particulate matter from reaching the central airways. The trachea and conducting airways of the transbronchial tree are usually effective in entrapping particles from 2 to 10 \u00b5m. The sharp angles at which the central airways branch cause particles to impact on mucosal surfaces, where they are entrapped by endobronchial mucus.

Four distinct populations of macrophages exist in the lung and vary in their location and function.11, 12 The alveolar macrophage is located in the alveolar-lining fluid at the interphase between air and lung tissue. It serves as the resident phagocytic cell in the lower airway and is the first phagocyte encountered by inert particles and potential pathogens entering the lung via inspired air. Alveolar macrophages play several critical roles.7 As phagocytic cells, they can eliminate certain organisms. If the numbers of organisms increase beyond the macrophages' capability to handle them or if the organisms involved are particularly virulent (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the macrophage becomes a mediator of an inflammatory response by producing cytokines that recruit neutrophils into the lung.13 Interstitial macrophages are located in the lung connective tissue and serve as both phagocytic cells and antigen-processing cells. Dendritic cells derive from monocytes and are located within the epithelium of the trachea, conducting airways, terminal airways, alveolar septa, pulmonary vasculature, and visceral pleura. These cells are therefore positioned to interact with antigens in inhaled air. Dendritic cells (and a specialized subpopulation termed Langerhans cells) possess an enhanced capacity to capture, process, and present class II antigens. They can migrate to lymphoid tissue, where they can stimulate T-cell immune responses. Dendritic cells can also produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-12, which serves to stimulate B-cell immune function.14 The intravascular macrophage is located in the capillary endothelial cells. These cells are actively phagocytic and remove foreign or damaged material entering the lungs via the bloodstream.",

Pattern recognition receptor families such as Toll-like receptors are present on epithelioid cells, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, as well as other cells that are located in strategic areas of the lung and either individually or in groups serve to recognize molecular patterns of invading organisms.21 This recognition leads to the generation of early-response cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-I that then activate transcription factors such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and interferon-regulatory factors. These transcription factors serve as a common pathway for pattern recognition receptors and orchestrate the development of the inflammatory response by mediating the transcription of chemokines, adhesin molecules, and other cytokines. This signal cascade serves two purposes. The first is to generate and maintain the inflammatory response to recruit neutrophils into areas of microbial invasion. The other goal is to activate anti-inflammatory response mediators, which lead to the shedding of receptors, neutralization of cytokines, and inhibition of macrophage recruitment, which all serve to ensure that the inflammatory response is held in check and that noninvolved areas of lung are not injured. It is this balance of pro\u00adinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules that allows for sterilization of an infected area of lung without gross destruction of the lung itself. In addition, it is now recognized that polymorphisms and defects are not uncommonly found for both pattern recognition receptors and the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators and that these genetic variations can contribute to an individual's susceptibility to pneumonia.20\n",

LES cells are predominantly memory T cells and interact both with epithelial cells and dendritic cells. Interstitial cells are similarly predominantly T cells but with a different CD4/CD8 ratio than seen with that of either LES cells or intravascular lymphocytes and with an abundance of natural killer cells. In addition, although uncommon in adults, in childhood there are organized lymphoid tissue collections in the lung located in follicles along the bronchial tree termed bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) collections. BALT collections appear to be morphologically similar to Peyer's patches in the intestine and are similarly associated with both the vasculature and the mucosal epithelium. Inhaled antigens therefore are able to cross the epithelial surface and immediately encounter cells involved with antigen processing. Once these antigens are processed and presented, B and T lymphocytes localize and are stimulated to become memory cells and effector cells, with antibody production occurring in this tissue.",

The lung contains a variety of cytotoxic T cells, including natural killer cells (antigen nonrestricted), antibody-dependent cytotoxic cells, and antigen-restricted cytotoxic cells. Pulmonary T cells produce a large number of cytokines. Mouse models suggest that unstimulated T cells produce mainly IL-2. After stimulation and conversion to memory T cells, two distinct groupings of cytokines are produced. The helper T-cell 1 (Th1) and 2 (Th2) pattern of cytokine production noted in murine models occurs in humans, although it appears to be less restrictive. Th1 cells produce interferon-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 and contribute to cell-mediated immunity, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 and contribute to humoral immune function. Furthermore, IL-3, TNF-\u03b1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and chemokines are secreted by both Th1 and Th2 phenotypes. Th1 cells are involved in cell-mediated inflammatory reactions, whereas Th2 cells stimulate antibody production, especially IgE, and stimulate eosinophil activity. However, there appears to be both Th1 and Th2 responses in many immune responses.

However, because the tracheobronchial tree is often colonized with Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae, it has been difficult to distinguish clearly between colonization and infection in many studies. Although these organisms play an important role as etiologic agents of pneumonia in this patient population, most of the clinical studies were carried out before it was recognized that other, less common pathogens also play a significant role in causing disease. The roles of Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Chlamydia, and aerobic gram-negative rods including P. aeruginosa have been established.63, 64, 65 Cystic fibrosis is commonly associated with Pseudomonas and staphylococcal pulmonary infections.51\nBurkholderia spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and atypical mycobacteria are also important pulmonary pathogens in this setting.

Principal risk factors for pneumonia in this population include low current CD4+ count, nadir CD4+ count, injection drug use, smoking, increasing age, and lack of highly active antiretroviral therapy and anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis.67, 70 In considering the etiology of pulmonary infection in patients infected with HIV, geographic exposures, demographic characteristics of the patient, and the degree of immune suppression need to be considered. With the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and effective prophylactic strategies, the incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with AIDS has decreased from 70% to 80% to less than 1 per 100 patient-years.71 It is now predominantly seen in individuals who have a CD4+ count less than 100/mm3 and are either unaware of having HIV infection or are not receiving care.69 Bacterial pneumonia was a significant complication for HIV-infected individuals and in the pre-antiretroviral era with an incidence 5- to 10-fold that seen in the general population; and the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is more than 50-fold higher in HIV-infected patients than in non\u2013HIV-infected controls.70, 72 The incidence of these infections has now notably decreased, although there remains a high risk in patients not on treatment.69 The incidence of pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa and S. aureus has also been notably higher in HIV-infected patients.69 Although relatively less common in the developed world, in developing countries, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is now viewed as the major pulmonary pathogen in patients with AIDS.68 The use of HAART has led to a decreased incidence of AIDS, but its overall importance as a pulmonary pathogen remains. In the severely immunosuppressed HIV population, fungal infections can play a major role, and depending on the patient's exposure history, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis should be considered.",

The role of microbiologic tests to identify the specific cause is an important, although controversial, element of care. Most empirical antibiotic regimens are successful in the therapy for CAP, especially mild to moderate cases. Studies comparing empirical therapy with laboratory-guided pathogen-directed care have shown no differences in efficacy, although increased side effects were noted in the patients receiving empirical therapy.82 Efforts to determine the specific cause of CAP are justified by the fact that they (1) may enable the clinician to narrow the antibiotic spectrum by using fewer agents, thereby decreasing exposure of the patient to potential side effects and potentially reducing the development of resistance; (2) may aid in the specific antibiotic choice for an individual patient depending on the specific epidemiology of infection and the specific resistance patterns of the locale; and (3) may identify pathogens not usually suspected and therefore not usually covered by empirical therapy. On a broader scale, identifying specific causes may help define new agents, trends in antibiotic resistance in established agents, and epidemiology of infectious outbreaks. The combined use of the standard microbiologic testing in conjunction with nucleic amplification assays can now define the etiology of CAP in up to 89% of cases.83 The most recent guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) have suggested diagnostic testing \u201cwhenever the result is likely to change individual antibiotic management\u201d or in patients in whom \u201cthe diagnostic yield is thought to be greatest.\u201d84\n",

The presence of alveolar macrophages does not alter the bacteriologic findings when substantial numbers of epithelial cells are present, indicating that otherwise adequate samples of sputum can be contaminated with oropharyngeal contents and thereby rendered nondiagnostic. This type of initial screening has proved helpful in differentiating adequate sputum samples from saliva, thereby increasing the diagnostic yield of sputum culture.",

Whereas a variety of PCR techniques have been described, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed assays exist for only M. tuberculosis, Legionella spp., and respiratory viruses. Assays for more commonly encountered organisms such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia spp. have been developed, but lack of standardization and difficulty in determining true infection from colonization remain problematic. False-negative results have been reported because of the presence of natural inhibitors. Although the PCR assay has been used to detect P. jirovecii, published studies have detected positive results in the setting of negative cultures and absence of clinical features of infection. PCR techniques have been used to identify DNA from M. tuberculosis in both sputum and lavage fluid. Sensitivities of 90% to 100% have been seen with patients who are acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positive, and results are reported as 50% to 70% in patients who are AFB smear negative; specificities as high as 99% have been noted. However, PCR assay may remain persistently positive in patients recently treated for tuberculosis and with no apparent active disease. Several individual pathogen and multiplex real-time PCR assay systems have become commercially available for the detection of community respiratory viruses.103 The test systems differ for viral pathogens that they detect, and \u201cin-house\u201d assays for select pathogens are frequently not FDA approved. Available assays can detect influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and bocavirus in respiratory secretions with high sensitivity and specificity for the presence of viral nucleic acid. However, it is unclear if positive results indicate upper rather than lower respiratory tract infection, colonization, or true infection of the lung or even the presence of infectious virus particles. Overall, these molecular assays have clear utility for research purposes.61, 83 However, they remain expensive, and although they may be of benefit in the management of severely ill hospitalized patients and in select clinical settings, the cost-effectiveness for the general management of acute pneumonia has not yet been defined.",

Others have reported false-negative rates of over 30% and many more organisms isolated by endotracheal suctioning than by brushing.120 In addition, in the setting of VAP, concern remains about sampling error, as well as the potential for differing pathogens in different lung segments. At present, none of these techniques has been shown to increase the accuracy in diagnosing VAP, and studies of clinical outcome have found that mortality from VAP is unchanged independent of whether bronchoscopic or nonbronchoscopic procedures are used for diagnosis.121, 122\n",

This stage is due to pulmonary interstitial fluid entering the pleural space and increased permeability of the capillaries in the pleura. These uncomplicated pleural effusions usually resolve with therapy for the underlying disease. Without appropriate therapy, pleural effusions become infected with the organisms causing the underlying pneumonia and develop into the second stage or fibropurulent stage. This stage is associated with positive microbial cultures, pH less than 7.2, glucose level less than 60 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase level that is greater than three times the upper limit of normal. Such complicated pleural effusions require drainage. The most sensitive finding in determining if a pleural effusion needs drainage is a pleural fluid pH less than 7.2. This usually occurs before the other chemical parameters associated with complicated pleural effusions develop.128 If pH is used to determine if an effusion is to be drained, it must be measured with a blood gas machine, not a pH meter or pH indicator strip, which can be inaccurate. If left untreated, fibropurulent pleural effusions will develop into stage three effusions in which a thick pleural rind is formed that restricts normal lung expansion.",

Serologic assays have been used to diagnose infections caused by Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp., and Coxiella burnetii. The sensitivity and specificity of the assays vary, and their overall usefulness in making a rapid diagnosis is limited. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC) have established diagnostic standards for Chlamydia assays.145 Microimmunofluorescence (MIF) for serum chlamydial antigens has been recommended, although enzyme immunoassays are also available and may be more sensitive and specific.146 For the MIF assay, an IgM titer of greater than 1 : 16 or a fourfold rise in IgG value is used to define positivity. Use of a single IgG value is not viewed as a definitive test. Because the present assays show day-to-day variation, it has been suggested that acute and convalescent titers be assayed at the same time. A fourfold rise in IgG rather than a single clinical titer is accepted as a positive test for M. pneumoniae.\n147 Although an elevated IgM titer suggests a recent infection, reinfection with Mycoplasma occurs frequently and a rise of IgM may not always be seen.148 Cold agglutinins may be elevated in infections with M. pneumoniae. Titers greater than or equal to 1 : 4 are suggestive of M. pneumoniae infection. For both mycoplasmal and chlamydial infections, nucleic amplification technologies are being examined as alternative diagnostic modalities.145, 147, 149\n",

Procalcitonin appears to be the earliest marker to appear during the course of infection. Clinical trials have now found that the presence of an elevated procalcitonin level (>0.25 to 0.5 \u00b5g/L) can be used to identify patients requiring treatment for pneumonia and, based on whether levels fall, how long antibiotics should be continued without increasing the risk for an adverse outcome.161, 162, 163 Procalcitonin has also been used as a gauge of pneumonia-related mortality.164 C-reactive protein is an acute-phase reactant produced in the liver as a response to a variety of stimuli, including infection. Normal values of less than 10 mg/L are unusual in patients with pneumonia and can be used to exclude the diagnosis. Levels of 100 mg/L or greater suggest the diagnosis of pneumonia and have been associated with an increased 30-day mortality and a greater likelihood of need for ventilator or vasopressor support (i.e., severe pneumonia).160 In comparative trials, C-reactive protein appears to have a better ability to define infection and procalcitonin the clinical severity, although definitive studies are lacking.159 Other cytokines studied include IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, but their correlations with pneumonia appear less consistent. Cortisol levels have also been shown to predict the severity of pneumonia and the chance of survival.165, 166 Although the clinical trials with procalcitonin have shown a reduction in antibiotic costs, there can be significant expense in performing these biomarker assays, and large-scale randomized studies of their cost-effectiveness are lacking. Thus, their role in diagnosis and severity assessment in pneumonia has not been clearly defined.",

The differential diagnosis of respiratory complaints and abnormal physical findings includes upper and lower respiratory tract infection as well as an array of noninfectious entities. Demonstration of an abnormal chest radiograph with pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia differentiates a patient population that may benefit from antibiotic therapy from the populations that will not. Because overuse of antibiotics for therapy for upper respiratory tract infections has been documented and may contribute to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, identifying patients who really should be receiving antibiotic therapy is clearly of importance. The chest radiograph is readily available, is reasonably reliable (despite interobserver variability), and should be obtained in most patients suspected of having pneumonia.84, 173, 174 The extent and nature of radiographic abnormalities may define patients who are more seriously ill and may need close monitoring.",

Staphylococcal pneumonia may result from infection metastasizing from a primary focus unrelated to the lung. In these cases, multiple nodular infiltrates throughout the lung may be seen. Staphylococci may cause marked necrosis of lung tissue with ill-defined thin-walled cavities (pneumatoceles), bronchopleural fistulas, and empyema, especially in children (Fig. 69-11\n). S. aureus producing the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, whether methicillin resistant or not, is associated with necrotizing pneumonia with multilobar cavitary lesions and is frequently associated with pleural effusions and empyema.175, 176 Although pneumatoceles are diagnostically significant findings in staphylococcal pneumonia, they may be seen in pneumonias with other causes, including K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and, more rarely, Pneumocystis.

Diffuse and localized involvement with both interstitial and alveolar patterns has been noted (Fig. 69-12\n).177 There is little radiologic distinction between the various viral causes of pneumonia. Influenza pneumonia is associated with poorly defined, patchy airspace consolidation with rapid confluence. Varicella pneumonia usually involves peribronchial involvement with nodular infiltrates. Adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus, all of which are more common in immunocompromised hosts, may be associated with diffuse bilateral bronchopneumonia, areas of overinflation, atelectasis, and nodular opacities. Lobar or subsegmental consolidation mimicking bacterial pneumonia may also be seen in patients infected with adenovirus and herpes simplex virus. Hantavirus pneumonia usually presents as interstitial edema, which may progress to consolidation representing a pulmonary capillary leak syndrome. Bilateral involvement and pleural effusion are common and when present are associated with a worse clinical outcome.178 Both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and a newer novel coronavirus identified in 2012 can cause pneumonia that begins predominantly with bilateral interstitial basilar infiltrates and progresses to severe symmetrical airspace disease.179, 180, 181 Other recently defined viral pulmonary pathogens are the human metapneumovirus and bocavirus. Most cases of human metapneumovirus infection involve upper respiratory tract infections in children; pneumonia in adults has been described.182, 183 Multilobar infiltrates have been noted in 50% of cases, and pleural effusions are not uncommon. Bocavirus pneumonia is more frequently reported in children and has been associated with patchy or interstitial infiltrates that are similar to those found with other common respiratory virus infections.184\n",

Pneumonia developing behind an obstruction caused by tumors or other masses and lung abscess may also be better defined by CT than by routine chest radiographs.189 Compared with a routine chest radiograph, high-resolution CT detects lung abnormalities more often and does a better job in defining disease in the upper and lower lobes and in the lingula. However, exposure to more radiation (the radiation from one CT scan equals that from six to seven chest radiographs) and the increased expense (approximately seven times the cost of a chest radiograph) has limited its use as the initial radiographic procedure. Furthermore, it is unclear if all abnormalities found on the chest CT scan truly represent pneumonia.190 In the immunocompromised host in whom infection is only one of the possible causes of abnormal chest radiographs, chest CT or one of its variations, such as spiral CT or high-resolution CT, may aid in better defining a \u201cquestionable\u201d chest radiograph and may be helpful in localizing involved areas of lung as a guide to biopsy procedures. CT scans are also more sensitive in defining parenchymal disease in the ICU setting. Certain infections, such as those caused by Aspergillus, M. tuberculosis, and Pneumocystis, have characteristic appearances on CT that in the correct clinical setting may make invasive procedures unnecessary. Both ultrasound and CT imaging may be more sensitive in defining pleural effusions than plain radiographs.191 Techniques such as perfusion magnetic resonance imaging have been shown to be able to differentiate pneumonia from COPD and pulmonary emboli.

Many of the syndromes have overlapping signs and symptoms, which at times makes clear identification of a specific syndrome in an individual impossible.193, 194 Increases in numbers of patients living longer, more and varied comorbidities, the increasing use of biologic immunomodulators such as TNF inhibitors, and expanded contact with various aspects of the health care system have led to a wider array of presentations, etiologic agents, and strategies for empirical therapy.

Causes have varied in different series depending on the means of diagnosis, the patient population studied (outpatient vs. institutionalized older adults), and the geographic location. In general, the cause of CAP in the older population follows the general trend of infection in younger populations. S. pneumoniae remains the predominant organism, accounting for 20% to 60% of cases, and there is an increased frequency of aspiration pneumonia.76, 216\nH. influenzae, usually a nontypeable strain, is frequently the second most common agent, accounting for 5% to 10% of episodes.76, 220 The importance of other aerobic gram-negative bacilli in causing pneumonia in older adults remains a question, in part because the criteria for diagnosis of true pneumonia versus colonization vary. In most recent studies, 1% to 3% of cases of pneumonia have been attributed to non-Haemophilus gram-negative bacilli. Although increased oropharyngeal colonization with aerobic gram-negative bacilli has been documented in the older population and is believed to be a predisposition to development of pneumonia caused by these organisms, colonization appears to be related to debility of the patient rather than age.221 Other factors reported to be associated with increasing colonization with gram-negative organisms include prior use of antibiotics, severe bronchopulmonary disease, decreased activity, alcoholism, and incontinence.212 In this regard, one recent study of apparent aspiration pneumonia in a nursing home population older than 65 years of age that utilized protected bronchoalveolar lavage to define the microbiologic etiology identified gram-negative bacteria as the primary pathogen in 49%, followed by mixed anaerobes in 16%.222 Older adults are at greater risk for infection with group B streptococci, M. catarrhalis, and Legionella species, although the overall incidence of these agents in the older population is relatively low. Legionella has been described as a cause of severe pneumonia in the elderly. Polymicrobial infections and pneumonia due to aspiration have both been noted to occur more frequently in older adults.75, 76\n",

Recent studies indicate that up to half of the patients with a viral pathogen identified will have concurrent bacterial infection, and multiple concurrent viral pathogens also can be seen.226 Rhinoviruses have not been defined as a direct cause of pneumonia but have been found in patients with severe pneumococcal disease and in vitro have shown increased adherence of S. pneumoniae to human tracheal epithelial cells.226, 227 These findings raise the question as to whether some viruses play a role as facilitators for bacterial infection rather than roles as true pulmonary pathogens.",

Although shock or respiratory failure are usually evident and serve as major criteria for defining severe pneumonia, patients without these findings may also benefit from ICU care. During the past 2 decades a number of prediction rules have been developed to assess severity and prognosis of patients with pneumonia, including but not limited to the pneumonia severity index (PSI),234 the confusion, urea, respiratory rate, low blood pressure (CURB) score,241 the CURB plus age older than 65 (CURB-65),242 the CURB-65 score without the urea level (CRB-65),243 the severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) score,244 the SMART-COP score,245 and the risk of early admission to the Intensive care unit (REA-ICU) index.246 These rules vary in complexity as well as their sensitivity and specificity for defining the need for ICU care but use a combination of factors, including age, gender, comorbid conditions, vital sign parameters, and laboratory and radiographic findings, to predict either the need for ICU care or the patients' prognosis.

            "text": "In the past, a basic distinction in the epidemiology of pneumonia has been whether the infection developed in the community or in the hospital. The distinction was clinically relevant because the importance of various etiologic agents differed, as did antibiotic susceptibilities. Consequently, the guidelines for empirical antibiotic therapy differed depending on where the infection developed. Because an increased amount of health care delivery has been shifted to the outpatient setting, even complex medical conditions may be handled without hospitalization. Subsequently, a growing number of patients develop pneumonia after extensive outpatient contact with various aspects of the health care system. This has led to a blurring of the distinction between CAP and nosocomial pneumonia. Recently, it has been recognized that HCAP represents a distinct syndrome that is a hybrid of CAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).77, 78, 247 The exact definition used in studies has varied, but in general it has been defined as pneumonia developing in patients who have been hospitalized for 2 or more days within 90 days of developing infection; patients attending hospital or hemodialysis clinics; patients receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy, wound care, or chemotherapy at home within 30 days of developing infection; and residents of long-term care facilities or nursing homes.77 Aerobic gram-negative bacilli including P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus including MRSA, and mixed aerobic-anaerobic pathogens associated with aspiration have been most commonly reported.78, 248 The role of S. pneumoniae has been variable, but in general it appears to play a lesser role than in patients with classic CAP. Overall mortality appears to be higher in patients with HCAP (10.3% to 19.8%) than in CAP (4.3% to 10%) and generally comparable to that of HAP.78, 247, 248 It is not clear whether this is due to increased comorbidities in patients, more virulent organisms causing infection, an increased incidence of inappropriate antibiotic usage in the first 48 hours of care, or some combination of these factors.",

Other agents such as Chlamydia psittaci, Francisella tularensis, M. tuberculosis, and C. burnetii may also cause atypical pneumonia. In patients with AIDS, Pneumocystis and nontuberculous mycobacteria should also be included. Although some series report that almost 50% of patients with CAP demonstrate serologic evidence of mycoplasmal or chlamydial pneumonia, or both, other series suggest an incidence of 7% to 28%.55, 83, 193, 197, 250, 251, 252 The differing incidence of mycoplasmal and chlamydial disease in differing studies may be related to the presence of epidemics by these pathogens during study periods, as well as the diagnostic methodologies utilized.

Up to one third of patients may have ear symptoms. Although bullous myringitis has been historically linked to mycoplasmal infection, this appears to be a rare finding. Fever, malaise, coryza, headache, and protracted nonproductive cough represent the major clinical findings. Pleuritic chest pain, splinting, and respiratory distress are not usually seen. Moist or crepitant rales may be heard. Sputum production is variable, and the sputum is purulent in one third to one half of the cases. Gram stain and culture of sputum usually reveal mouth microbiota. White blood cell counts greater than 10,000/mm3 are uncommon, occurring in approximately 20% of the patients.90 An elevated sedimentation rate is noted in about 25% of the cases. Pulmonary involvement seen on radiographs is commonly more extensive than the physical examination would indicate. Unilateral or bilateral patchy infiltrates in one or more segments, usually in the lower lobes, are noted in a bronchial or peribronchial distribution. Upper lobe involvement and pleural effusions are less common but may be seen in up to 20% to 30% of cases.185, 186 Progression of the radiographic picture, despite a stable clinical picture, may be seen. The overall clinical course in most cases is benign. Disappearance of constitutional symptoms is usually noted in the first and second weeks, although cough and radiographic changes may persist for several weeks. Occasionally, M. pneumoniae infection presents as severe CAP that requires intensive care.254 A large number of extrapulmonary manifestations may occur with M. pneumoniae infection, including involvement of skin, central nervous system, blood, and kidneys (see Chapter 185).",

The majority of infections are either asymptomatic or produce mild symptoms. As with mycoplasmal infection, sore throat and hoarseness herald the onset of pneumonia, although the progression of symptoms appears slower than that noted with mycoplasmal or viral pneumonia. Cough may begin after several days to weeks, suggesting a biphasic illness. Hoarseness and sinus tenderness appear more commonly than in patients infected with Mycoplasma or viruses. The white blood cell count is rarely elevated. Pneumonia with C. pneumoniae is usually mild, although complete recovery may be slow. Cough and malaise may persist for weeks to months. Reinfection occurs and appears to be milder than primary infection and is usually not associated with pneumonia. Chronic and latent infections have also been described. Infection with C. pneumoniae has been associated with exacerbations of COPD and asthma. In general, few features distinguish chlamydial pneumonia from infection caused by other atypical agents or other bacteria. C. pneumoniae infections have been associated with extrapulmonary manifestations, including otitis, sinusitis, pericarditis, myo\u00adcarditis, and endocarditis. It has also been associated with coronary artery disease, although the definite relationship remains unclear (see Chapter 184).",

These findings mostly reflect the severity of the pneumonia rather than specificity to Legionella infections.

Aspiration may be associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome, atelectasis, bronchial hyperreactivity, and fibrosis. Although chemical pneumonitis and mechanical obstruction usually cause acute symptoms, aspiration pneumonia is more insidious, with symptoms usually occurring gradually several days after the initial episode of aspiration. Pneumonitis, necrotizing pneumonia, abscess, and empyema are common. Symptoms often include fever, weight loss, and productive cough. Foul-smelling or putrid sputum occurs commonly.269 Anemia and an elevated white blood cell count are frequent associated findings. The bacteriologic findings in aspiration pneumonia reflect the microbiota of the oropharynx, and the importance of periodontal disease in this regard has been noted. Studies performed in the 1970s on patients with indolent disease using the technique of transtracheal aspiration and analysis in anaerobic research laboratories documented anaerobic involvement in the majority of cases either alone or in combination with oral aerobic or facultative anaerobes.270\nBacteroides spp., Porphyromonas spp., Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium spp., and anaerobic gram-positive cocci are the predominant anaerobes isolated. In community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, Streptococcus spp. and H. influenzae are the most common aerobic isolates. In contrast, gram-negative bacilli (including P. aeruginosa) and S. aureus are the most commonly isolated aerobes from nosocomial aspiration pneumonia including VAP, as well as pneumonia occurring in nursing home patients.77, 222\n",

S. aureus causes 13% to 40% of nosocomial pneumonia, and MRSA is now a major pathogen in this setting.74, 77 In contrast to their prominent role in CAP, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae together cause only 5% to 15% of nosocomial pneumonias in most studies and are predominantly seen in infections developing early in the hospital course. There is only limited information comparing the bacteriology of VAP and non\u2013ventilator-associated HAP, but the available data indicate that the general distribution of aerobic pathogens is relatively comparable, although there is an increase in the relative prevalence of gram-negative pathogens in patients with VAP, particularly nonenteric gram-negative bacilli.74, 281 Although the use of sedatives, feeding tubes, and endotracheal tubes are all risk factors for the development of aspiration pneumonia, the lack of support for anaerobic microbiologic testing has led to a paucity of data on the roles of anaerobic bacteria in HAP.267 One study performed in the early 1970s at a veterans hospital with bacteriologic analysis in a research laboratory documented anaerobes in up to 35% of cases of nosocomial pneumonia, and a second, more recent study identified anaerobes in conjunctions with aerobic microbiota in 23% of patients with VAP.282, 283 These organisms should be considered when aspiration is likely to have occurred.

The respiratory viruses influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and RSV can cause sporadic nosocomial pneumonia as well as occasional institutional outbreaks.

Linezolid and vancomycin are the best-studied agents for treatment of MRSA pneumonia, and clindamycin has also appeared effective in children.305, 317 A prospective controlled trial comparing linezolid and vancomycin with HAP or HCAP due to MRSA found a better initial clinical outcome for patients treated with linezolid but no difference in mortality at 60 days.318 A new cephalosporin, ceftaroline, has good in vitro activity against MRSA isolates and may prove to be another alternative for treatment of MRSA pneumonia, although clinical trials of its use in this setting are not currently available.319 Should the patient be found to have methicillin-susceptible S. aureus pneumonia, treatment with nafcillin or oxacillin is preferred. Current clinical efficacy data on the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, or tigecycline for treatment of staphylococcal pneumonia are not available.",

Despite the lack of a prospective randomized study, advising and regulatory agencies, including the Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, began to use the 4-hour rule as a core quality measure.

Patients with more severe illness generally take longer to stabilize. The addition of monitoring for an at least 50% reduction in C-reactive protein has been suggested as an additional measure to define clinical stability but appeared beneficial only for patients with severe disease, and the cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been assessed.332 Overall, once stability is achieved, clinical relapses serious enough to require ICU care occur less than 1% of the time.",

Currently, for adult patients with CAP the IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend a minimum of at least 5 days of antibiotic therapy, with the patient being afebrile for between 48 and 72 hours and lacking no more than one sign of clinical stability.84 Similarly, the BTS guidelines recommend 7 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy for patients with low- or moderate-severity CAP treated either as outpatients or inpatients.284 Longer therapy should be considered for patients who have high-severity disease, bacteremic S. aureus pneumonia, or cavitary disease.

The macrolide family has been shown to have in vitro immunomodulatory activity, which may contribute to their efficacy in CAP.348 A number of randomized controlled trials have now investigated the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for CAP using differing dosages and agents. To date there is no evidence of an impact on overall mortality, although corticosteroids may shorten overall inpatient length of stay by 1 day.349, 350 Statins also possess anti-inflammatory properties, and their impact on CAP has been assessed in observational studies. Although there was initial suggestive evidence of benefit, those studies were not randomized and did not control for other potentially important variables, such as underlying health or socioeconomic status.351 A more recent study that controlled for these factors found no impact of recent statin use on the incidence of severe sepsis or mortality from CAP.352 Although other adjunctive therapies have been described, including the use of activated protein C, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, anticoagulants, immunoglobulin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, probiotics, chest physiotherapy, antiplatelet drugs, over-the-counter cough medications, \u03b22-agonists, inhaled nitric oxide, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in clinical trials none of these approaches has been shown to have a significant role in therapy.353\n",
