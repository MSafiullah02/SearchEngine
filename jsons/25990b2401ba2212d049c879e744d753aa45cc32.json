The goal of these guidelines is to highlight specific considerations for patients with COVID-19 on an individual and population level. Any airway procedure increases the risk of exposure and transmission from patient to provider. In such a rapidly escalating pandemic, the aim in treating patients with COVID-19 disease is to maximize the likelihood of recovery for the greatest number of patients as quickly as possible in a way that minimizes the risk to the provider. In these rapidly-changing times, the \"standard\" of care may not be one to which providers are accustomed, but the authors feel that it is critical to apply and carefully adapt the best existing evidence on this topic to the current pandemic.",

This person may in turn consult with the multidisciplinary tracheotomy working group as needed. 2. Tracheotomy before 21 days should not be routinely performed in COVID-19 patients solely for prolonged ventilator dependence, given the high risk of transmission and poor prognosis of patients requiring intubation and ventilation in the existing literature. It may be considered before 21 days in patients with increased requirement for pulmonary toilet or high levels of sedation, or if incoming data from Europe suggests an improved prognosis over the current data cited herein. 3.

Prior to resuming ventilation, the cuff should be assessed for rupture. If ruptured, ventilation should remain held. o Ventilation should again be held as the ETT is withdrawn in preparation for tracheotomy tube insertion. o If cuff position could not be previously confirmed via palpation, ventilation should be heldand the cuff fully deflated while the trachea is incised. The cuff position can then be adjusted through the tracheal opening before reinflation. -A Bj\u00f6rk flap is recommended to avoid false passage in the event of accidental decannulation. -Insertion of the tracheotomy tube should be accurate and quick to minimize open airway time.",
