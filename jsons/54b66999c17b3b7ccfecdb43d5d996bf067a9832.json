In this case, a nutrient load that is discharged at the head of the bay is transported to distant locations and, probably, the water exchange rate of the bay also increases. The nutrient loading that is permissible -i.e. which the bay can accept -will then increase due to the increase in the water exchange rate. For water retention rates, the strength of currents is not as important as spatial patterns. For example, tidal currents are dominant in urban coastal areas. However they are oscillatory. Water particles in tidal currents move to the head of the bay during flood tides, but move back to the mouth of the bay during ebb tides. As a result, tidal currents do not substantially transport water particles. In contrast, density currents are clearly weaker than tidal currents, but they flow in one direction continuously and transport water particles more efficiently.

One of the most important phenomena induced by the density effect is stratification. Once stratification occurs in a coastal zone, surface water and bottom water are isolated. This process is very important when we discuss the distributions of pollutants from the land. Stratification also enhances the increase of phytoplankton in the surface layer and oxygen depletion near the seabed. Moreover, estuarine circulation is induced by density differences in the salty sea water and the river flow. Fig. 3-3 shows a schematic diagram of estuarine circulation. River water runs through the urban area and runs off from the river mouth, spreading over the sea surface like a veil since river water has low density compared with saline sea water. To cancel the density difference between the river water and the saline water, a great deal of sea water is entrained into the river water flow. Such a mixing process continues until the river water reaches the same density as the surrounding sea water, resulting in vertical circulation in the bays that is is several to ten times greater than the river flux (Unoki 1998) . Thus, estuarine circulation induces seaward currents on the surface and landward currents near the bottom. The speed of the currents is slow compared with the tidal currents, as explained previously. Since estuarine circulations are in a fixed direction, its material transport is very effective over a long time scale in spite of the small magnitude of its velocity. Estuarine circulation also plays an important role in the nutrient cycles of stratified bays. Organic matters are deposited on the seabed after phytoplankton blooms or river runoffs. They are decomposed by bacteria in the seabed.
