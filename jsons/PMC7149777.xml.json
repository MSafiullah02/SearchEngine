The earliest efforts to classify viruses were based upon host organism species, common clinical and pathological properties, tropism for particular tissues and organs, and common ecological and transmission characteristics. For example, viruses that cause hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A virus, family Picornaviridae; hepatitis B virus, family Hepadnaviridae; hepatitis C virus, family Flaviviridae; and Rift Valley fever virus, family Bunyaviridae) might have been brought together as \u201cthe hepatitis viruses.\u201d Such systems have now been superseded.",

In many cases, virologists have had to rely on indirect causal evidence, with associations based on epidemiology and patterns of antibody prevalence among populations. The framework of virus taxonomy, again, plays a role, especially in trying to distinguish an etiological, rather than coincidental or opportunistic relationship between a virus and a given disease. Particular difficulty arises where a disease occurs in only a small fraction of infected individuals, where the same apparent disease can be caused by more than one different agent, and in various chronic diseases and certain cancers. These difficulties are confounded in many instances where diseases cannot be reproduced by inoculation of experimental animals, or where the discovered viruses cannot be grown in animals or cell culture: there may even be a \u201chit and run\u201d relationship where the causative virus may no longer be present in the afflicted individual.

Early in the investigation of AIDS, before its etiology was established, many kinds of viruses were isolated from patients and many candidate etiological agents and other theories were advanced. Prediction that the etiological agent would turn out to be a member of the family Retroviridae was based upon years of research on animal retroviral diseases and many points of similarity with some characteristics of AIDS.

Thus, for many associations between a virus and a clinical disease, the concept of infection representing a \u201crisk factor\u201d is more appropriate than it being an absolute \u201ccause.\u201d It also now happens frequently using modern diagnostic methods, that viruses are recovered from individuals with some ongoing disease; however, careful work is essential in such cases to distinguish a true causative role from an unrelated infection of no clinical significance occurring at the same time.",

These data are rapidly challenging previous ideas about the origin and evolution of many viruses of medical importance. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses in particular sometimes provides unexpected answers that in turn create more questions; for example, hepadnaviruses share a similar reverse transcriptase-based replication strategy that is common to the caulimoviruses of plants\u2014does this reflect a common ancestor or convergent evolution?",
