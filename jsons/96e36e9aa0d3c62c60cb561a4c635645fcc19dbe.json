As with all medical specialties, infectious diseases has unique features that are important to highlight: Among medical specialties, this one is consistently changing, often unpredictable, usually exciting, and incredibly rewarding for health impact. It is also often challenging and seemingly underappreciated, at least until needed. These facts appear to be relatively idiosyncratic to this discipline with a menu of priority pathogens that is in constant flux and weaponry that will change in unpredictable ways. The extraordinary kinetics and ability to intervene successfully using public health, preventive vaccines, and disease-limiting antimicrobials are its great strengths. The following are some of the highlights and unique features of a career in the science and practice of infectious diseases. The menu includes the litany of epidemics, heroic efforts to conquer disease, our expectations with antimicrobials, vaccines and public health, and challenges that may lead to transformative interventions.",

He examined the cerebrospinal fluid, saw boxcar gram-positive rods, diagnosed anthrax, and predicted bioterrorism [1] . This was strong stuff at a time no one had thought much of bioterrorism anywhere in decades and especially in an obscure, small town in Florida. The ensuing epidemiologic investigation showed anthrax spores in this patient's workplace, the local postal service, and a letter received by the patient. This was the index case of the anthrax bioterrorism epidemic that shook the country in 2001.The result was a major national preparedness response to not only bioterrorism, but also preparedness for natural disasters, epidemics, and other major public health threats.",

Most of the patients had asymmetric swelling and pain of large joints, especially knees, and some also had an erythematous, annular rash [2] . It was initially called \"Lyme arthritis,\" but most physicians thought it was simply juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Dr Steere was convinced it was an infection and moreover, that it was arthopod-born based on epidemiology and clinical features. His relentless pursuit of the pathogen was finally rewarded with the discovery of the newly recognized spirochete in the blood and in typical skin lesions [3] . The specific agent was subsequently defined in a another extraordinary effort, this time by Dr Willie Bergdorfer, who had spent much of his career studying the microbiology of the hindgut of ticks; he successfully isolated the pathogen that he considered his last and most important scientific project [4, 5] . That agent is named in his honor: Borrelia burgdorferi [6] .",

No one paid attention until a young gastroenterologist, Dr Barry Marshall, agreed to study the association. This pairing was considered an \"odd couple\"; Dr Warren was described as quiet, thoughtful, and persistent whereas Dr Marshall was self-described as brash and determined [7] . Subsequent studies consistently showed the association between this curved microbe with gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, but there was almost uniform opposition from both gastroenterologists and infectious disease physicians. Larry Altman, noted medical editor for The New York Times, wrote that never in his experience had he witnessed such fierce opposition from the medical community to the possibility that peptic ulcer disease was caused by a microbe (L. Altman, personal communication, 16 May 2012) [8] . This prompted 2 proponents, Drs Barry Marshall and Alan Morris, to perform the ultimate experiment-they swallowed a flask of Helicobacter pylori (and suffered from the experience; L. Altman, personal communication, 16 May 2012) [9] . The long-term result of this unrelenting battle is now well known: H. pylori is accepted as the cause of peptic ulcer disease and its sequela, guidelines for diagnostic testing and treatment are based on H. pylori as the pathogen, this agent is listed as a class 1 carcinogen, and Nobel prizes were awarded to Drs Warren and Marshall [10] .",

This was the beginning of the infamous national epidemic of Exserohilum rostratum meningitis associated with the contaminated steroids that led to 741 cases and 55 deaths in 18 states.

She received penicillin intravenously starting 14 March 1942, promptly recovered, and survived to age 90 years [39] . This would appear to be \"evidence-based medicine\" with an n = 1. The following statement from Dr Walsh McDermott in 1982 summarizes this breakthrough especially well: \"Penicillin gave more curative power to a barefoot, itinerant care provider in the deepest reaches of Africa than the collective powers of all physicians in New York City\" [40] . The more recent experience with bacterial resistance and sparse pipeline threatens this miracle, but antiviral development is quite different, primarily for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). It now appears that patients with HIV can achieve near-normal longevity [41] . HCV infection is even more impressive in terms of speed of progress and ability to cure. The HCV treatment story reflects the efficiency of basic science to define targets, pharmaceutical skills of industry, well-organized trial networks, and a regulatory agency (US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) that facilitated product development [42] .",

This illustrates the challenge and the priorities [44] . Another challenge is epidemics involving nosocomial pathogens, as shown with the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemaseproducing bacteria (KPC) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. This began with a patient transferred from a New York City hospital with a KPC infection and became the source of an institutional outbreak that required extraordinary efforts to control, including a wall constructed to isolate cases, removal of plumbing (as a possible source), use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) molecular diagnostics to detect cases and carriers, hydrogen peroxide room aerosols, and \"whole house\" surveillance cultures. The epidemic was finally halted, but the toll was 18 cases and 6 fatalities over 6 months [45, 46] . Another KPC epidemiologic investigation showed widespread distribution of this microbe from a long-term acute-care facility in the Chicago area [47] , and others have demonstrated distribution of KPC by air travel from India to Europe [48] . These epidemics require extensive resources and specialized skills; they will be expected to increase substantially in the era of \"bad bugs.\"",

The use of antibiotics has selected for these genes by Mendelian laws, making it increasingly difficult to control previously treatable infections. This problem was predicted by the father of antibiotics, Alexander Fleming, who, in 1945, wrote that \". . . the public will demand the drug and . . . then will begin an era . . . of abuses. The microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out which can be passed to another individual and perhaps from there to others until they reach someone who gets a septicemia or a pneumonia which penicillin cannot save. In such a case, the thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to an infection with penicillin-resistant organisms. I hope this evil can be averted\" [50] . Also of note is the prediction by Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg: \"The future of humanity and microbes will likely evolve as . . . episodes of our wits vs their genes\" [51] . It now appears that Fleming's prediction is a harsh reality and evolutionary microbial resistance genes are gaining the upper hand, reflecting the combination of massive antibiotic use and lack of new pharmacologic agents. The result is the alarming escalation of antibiotic resistance that is global and applies to nearly all categories of treatable pathogens, leading some to predict \"the postantibiotic era.\" This resistance has been declared a \"crisis\" by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the CDC, WHO, the US Congress, and the US President.",

This is in sharp contrast to the European Union, which includes 28 countries with 24 official languages and diverse cultures, but has systematically collected data on antibiotic consumption and microbial resistance patterns for 15 years [52, 53] . This has resulted in multiple publications with data reviews, studies of interventions, messages to consumers such as an eBug Internet program for students, a European Antibiotic Awareness Day, standardized methods to collect data [54] and a recent 12-point plan with budget to address the issue [55] . Their data are striking in showing the dramatic association between per capita antibiotic use and national resistance patterns. For example, antibiotic consumption in Greece is nearly 4 times that of the Netherlands, so we expect more resistance problems in Greece, but the magnitude of this difference is alarming: Bacteremic carbapenemase strains among all bacteremic K. pneumoniae isolates appear to be about 150 times more common in Greece, and MRSA as a percentage of all S aureus isolates is about 40 times higher [51] . The European Union appears to have a mature and substantive model to learn from, with the important caveat that it functions well because there is no claimed ownership, as there are 28 equal partners.",

The major on-site forces for improving smart antibiotic use at the point of care are antibiotic stewards-preferably infectious disease or pharmacy personnel trained in this skill to improve the speed of detecting resistant or epidemic pathogens. The tools are obvious to infectious diseases-trained clinicians, but often require methods that are not well inculcated into hospital or clinic practice. Methodology with proven value for antibiotic conservation include shortcourse regimens (virtually always wins or ties in trials), use of procalcitonin to facilitate decisions on when to start or stop antibiotics, use of molecular diagnostics to improve pathogentargeted antibiotic decisions, outpatient infusion therapy to reduce inpatient risk (and cost), optimal use of the agents we have, waiting room with notices that the doctor will prescribe antibiotics only according to guidelines, acknowledgement of possible microbiome harm, and possible use of social network media [52, 53] . Nevertheless, there must be caution: The new US healthcare system represents socialized medicine largely managed by capitalists, which invites both quality and chicanery. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' \"6-hour rule\" for treating community-acquired pneumonia had improved outcome advantages, but also led to overprescribing, declined use of diagnostics, perceived antibiotic abuse, and increases in C. difficile infections. Given the priority of cost containment and its relevance to infectious diseases, infectious disease training should probably include attention to the business of medicine.",

That experience can now be applied to multiple iatrogenic infection risks associated with specific patients or procedures, possibly prioritizing those with the greatest healthcare consequences as described above. The role of infectious diseases is to define the bundle, design the study, and then implement them when results are convincing or even mandated.",
