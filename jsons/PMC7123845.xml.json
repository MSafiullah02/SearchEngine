For example, with some of these humidifiers, some potential beneficial effects were described on the control of hypercapnia and work of breathing (WOB) [13]. Furthermore, a form of agreement that humidification of inspired gases should be a standard of care has begun to evolve among specialists [1]. Since 2005, a growing number of studies on the use of humidification in NIV have been published. In this chapter, we discuss the international survey we conducted in 2008 in 15 hospitals to explore the practice of incorporating humidification in NIV [5].

The literature also lacks information about the frequency of this problem in patients with ARF on NIV. However, the application of a heated humidifier has proven to be useful and safe in the control of associated symptoms such as mucosal dryness, and therefore may contribute to improved comfort and compliance, especially in patients with chronic stable respiratory diseases [17, 18].

            "text": "Some factors that can influence the decision for early use of humidification are:\n\nCost-effectiveness:\nThe economic aspect and the cost of implementing humidification strategies is another considerable factor that can influence the selection of the humidifier to treat patients on NIV. A status of balance between the cost and the benefits of humidification should be achieved particularly when considering short-term use of NIV [18]. With regard to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), clinical aspects such as the duration of IMV, the increased risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia and weaning difficulties are well identified and important outcomes that favor the routine and early use of humidification [19, 20]. Unfortunately, in the case of NIV such clinical outcomes are not well identified and studied. Nevertheless, the development of complications as a result of not using proper humidification in patients with ARF treated with NIV will add to the cost of ARF treatment. Furthermore, failure of NIV for any reason will lead to a more costly intervention, such as endotracheal intubation. Therefore, it would be reasonable to identify patients on NIV at a moderate to high risk of developing complications if not using humidification and provide them with early humidification. One of the serious complications is the difficulty experienced with endotracheal intubation, which is attributed to the dryness of the upper airway mucosa [5, 8, 16, 21].\n\nType of respiratory disease:\nThe use of an early humidification strategy is required in respiratory failure secondary to some respiratory diseases, such as COPD and asthma, where the introduction of humidification has shown favorable effects [12, 14].\n\nType of ARF:\nWhen discussing the available data pertaining to humidification in NIV, we have to categorize ARF into hypoxemic and hypercapnic. In patients with hypoxemic ARF, data supporting the use of humidification are available for those requiring FiO2 greater than 0.60 and those who are expected to require a prolonged use of NIV (>2 h) [15, 16].In patients with hypoxemic ARF, data supporting the use of humidification are available for those requiring FiO2 greater than 0.60 and those who are expected to require a prolonged use of NIV (>2 h) [22] and characteristics of bronchial secretions [12, 23].\n\nVentilatory parameters:\nThe use of ventilatory parameters influences moisture loss. The higher the tidal volume (V\nT) and the higher the peak inspiratory flow rate, as with the NIV-CPAP systems, the greater the moisture loss is. Therefore, these physical conditions should be considered when applying NIV. Early institution of humidification reduces the effects of V\nT and flow rate on humidity [12, 24].\n\nBronchial secretion clearance:\nThe rheological property of the viscosity of bronchial secretions is an important determinant of the early humidification strategy, especially in critically ill patients, as discussed in other chapters of this book [25]. The loss of these characteristics leads to retention of the bronchial secretions, especially in the distal airways of the bronchial system that are difficult to draw from, and results in increased airway resistance, impaired gas exchange, and airway obstruction, etc. [6, 15, 21]. The early combination of proper humidification with cough-assist techniques is useful and can improve the outcome of the NIV. Other factors that can encourage an early implementation of humdification include: older age, increased nasal resistance, mucociliary dysfunction, medication that can cause dehydration of the mucosa, chronic nasal or respiratory diseases, mouth breathing, and bronchial hypersecretion, especially if associated with COPD or bronchiectasis [21, 23, 25]. Despite the long list of proposed benefits of humdification in NIV, it is usually used without humdification, and controversy still exits regarding humidification efficacy [1, 4]. More studies are needed to document the benefits of humidification in patients with ARF who require NIV. Although we still need more evidence, the application of humidification in the above-discussed conditions is encouraged.\n\n",

Heat-moisture exchange (HME) use for short-term NIV in patients with ARF is associated with less cross-infection [28]. The heated humidifier may carry a greater risk of spreading aerosols of respiratory viral infections (SARS, H1N1) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Nevertheless, the currently published work of the International Network Group, which was analyzed during the H1N1 pandemic, did not demonstrate such an association [29]. However, with the long-term use of NIV at home for OSAS, a potential risk of colonization and infection was described [30].\n",

Below is a summary of the available data.\n\nTypes of humidifiers\nThere are no data to support one humidification system over the other or to demonstrate the superiority of one over the other in terms of hygrometry efficacy or absolute humidity. The selection of the humidification system depends on other factors such as the interface (nasal, facial, helmet) [32], and the type of mechanical ventilator (home mechanical ventilator, high flow CPAP systems or ICU mechanical ventilators) [3, 5, 24, 31].\ni.\nHeated humidifier (HH)\nThe HH acts as an active system to increase the AH to acceptable levels with a minimal effect on the set inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) (on average IPAP can decrease by a value of 0.5\u20131 cmH2O) [20]. Currently HHs are \u00adpreferred when the air is dry and cold with retention of \u00adbronchial secretions [26]. Unidi\u00adrectional flow causes nasal mucosal dryness, promotes the release of inflammatory mediators, and increases nasal resistance [15, 21]. The HH increases the RH in the air, reduces nasal airway resistance, and may increase adherence to the NIV compared to HMEs [6, 8, 9, 17, 26, 33].\nii.\nHeat and moisture exchanger (HME)\nAs defined in other chapters, the HME acts by conserving moisture endogenously in the breathing circuit and is used when the patient has sufficient capacity to maintain AH of the inspired air. It is recommended to be applied early, but not recommended with all types of interfaces (nasal mask or face mask). They are ideal for the helmet system. Chanques et al. found that the humidifiers most commonly used are HMEs (52%), followed by HHs (26%), both (4%), and neither (19%) in postoperative resuscitation units.In our international survey, we analyzed the information from 15 hospitals including information on 1635 patients who had been treated with NIV in 2008 [5] (Fig. 11.1). When the results were analyzed in relation to the humidification system used, we found that the heated wire humidifier (HWH) was used most frequently (46.6%). No differences between countries, types of hospital settings, or acute care units were observed. This is different from the results of Chanques et al., who analyzed data collected from post-surgical observation units [31].\n\n\n\nHumidifier availability.\nHumidifier availability is influenced by several factors, including hospital area (acute care units, general wards, or out-patient setting), the type of ARF, the type of ventilator and interface used, and the number of patients treated simultaneously with NIV. The above are factors that determine the availability and type of humidifier to be selected [3, 5].\n\nProtocols of humidification.\nIn our survey, we observed that 40% of the surveyed hospitals do not have written protocols to guide the use of humidification in NIV. The utilization of humidification in NIV seems to depend to a large extent on the practitioner\u2019s experience and preference. There are no large epidemiological studies to analyze other factors associated with humidification and response to NIV. [5] (Figs. 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3).\n\n\n\nEducation.\nEducation is of paramount importance to achieve proper implementation and optimal results of humidification in NIV [26]. Our survey revealed that there was no formal training or education for NIV and humidification in the surveyed hospitals.\n\n",

However, based on the available data, the best strategy to ensure proper application of humidification in NIV is to first indentify the factors that may affect humidification and enhance moisture loss in patients with ARF, and then to apply the proper humidification system that suits each case based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition, the ventilator parameters, and the interface used. Early application of humidification may benefit patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure or obstructive pulmonary diseases, and patients on high-flow CPAP systems, or who need prolonged use of NIV. Multi-center studies with large numbers of patients are needed to identify the patient groups who are likely to benefit from the addition of humdification to NIV therapy and to assess the effect of humidification on adherence to NIV, and its effect on different outcome measures.",
