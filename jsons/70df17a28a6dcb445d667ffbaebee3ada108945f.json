            "text": "Since December 2019, just a month before the Chinese Spring Festival, multiple cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Later, a novel coronavirus was identified in a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample from the Wuhan Seafood Market using metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology. 1 On February 11, 2020, the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that can infect humans after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The World Health Organization announced that the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was classified as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The new coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of March 9, 2020, a total of 80,905 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with 3123 deaths have been reported in mainland China, and the epidemic has spread to >100 countries worldwide. 2 China has incorporated COVID-19 into class B infectious diseases, as stipulated by the law of the People's Republic of China for the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has taken preventive and control measures in accordance with Class A infectious diseases. The unprecedented number of COVID-19 cases not only in China but also in many countries has triggered the alarm for public health to respond to emerging and reemerging diseases. A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, clinical treatment, research, and development of vaccines and drugs, is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.",

The coronaviruses of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 genera generally infect mammals and humans, while the coronaviruses of the \u03b3 and \u03b4 genera mainly infect birds. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus of the \u03b2 genus; it is round or oval, with a diameter of approximately 60-140 nm and a crown-shaped appearance under an electron microscopy. 4 Besides SARS-CoV-2, six other coronaviruses can infect humans, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. A protein sequence analysis showed that the amino acid similarity of the seven conserved nonstructural proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was 94.6%, suggesting that they might belong to the same species. The homology between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the bat SARS-like coronavirus (Bat-CoV (RaTG13)) genome is 96%. 5 Coronaviruses are sensitive to heat and ultraviolet rays. They can be stored for several years at \u221280\u00b0C and inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min (the most commonly used method to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory). In addition, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid, and chlorinecontaining disinfectants can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2. 5",

            "text": "Coronavirus can cause human respiratory tract infection or animal intestinal infection. The process of virus infection requires the participation of receptors on the surface of the host cell membrane. The S protein on the surface of coronavirus can recognize and bind to the receptor and then invade the host cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. 6 Different coronaviruses can use different cell receptors to complete the invasion. For example, the receptor of HCoV-229E is aminopeptidase N (also known as CD13), the receptor of SARS-CoV is ACE2, 7 and the receptor of MERS-CoV is DPP4 (also known as CD26). 8 It has been indicated that aminopeptidase N and DPP4 are not receptors of SARS-CoV-2 and that ACE2 can be used as its receptor. 5 The pathogenicity of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 is relatively low, generally only causing slight respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause SARS and MERS, respectively. Both caused outbreaks with severe symptoms and a high mortality. 7, 8 Pathological findings of COVID-19 revealed that the overactivation of T cells, manifested by an increase in Th17 and the high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, partially accounts for the severe immune injury. 9 People are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, with an incubation period of 1-14 days, with an average of 3-7 days; the main source of infection is COVID-19 patients, and asymptomatic patients may also be the source of infection. 10, 11 The main route of transmission is respiratory droplets, and people can also be infected by coming into contact with articles contaminated with virus droplets. In addition, a study showed that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in the feces and urine of patients with COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted through the digestive tract through the fecal-oral route. The main symptoms of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. A few patients may have runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea. Some patients may have dyspnea, and those who have a serious form of COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulation dysfunction, and septic shock. 11, 12 From the existing treatment cases, mild patients only show low fever and slight fatigue but no pneumonia. Most patients have a good prognosis, a few patients may have a severe condition, and the elderly and those with chronic basic diseases have a poor prognosis.",
