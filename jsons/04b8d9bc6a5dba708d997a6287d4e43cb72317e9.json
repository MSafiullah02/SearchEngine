As the incidence and fatality rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the etiological agent of COVID-19, continues to rise across more than 210 countries and territories, several preventive and control measures have been adopted to halt the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and minimize COVID-19 associated death. As at 7:30AM GMT+1, 27 th April 2020, there were over 3 million global confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with case fatality rate (CFR) of over 7. 0% (Worldometer, 2020) . European and American countries appeared to have the worst CFRs associated with COVID-19 and least in Africa. Although, there is no categorical explanation for this variation. Several observers have attributed the low incidence rate of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa to under-diagnosis probably due to inadequate molecular diagnostic capacity. But variation in the genetics, strains, viral proteins mutations and host immune response could have contributed to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and pathogenesis (van Dorp et al., 2020) .",

Thus, the machine learning techniques have the ability to bring out some intrinsic and useful insights to help smart cities decision makers to take preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of the fact that different machine learning techniques are embraced by Artificial intelligence (AI), which is the model with the ability to self-learn, can also support immensely. It is important to discuss the role of the AI along with the machine learning to combat COVID-19 because first of all the data availability is too limited and we have to deal with real-time streaming of the data.

(Brown et al., 2020) developed a statistical model; also known as Global-19 Assessment of mortality trends in 12 countries between April 12, 2020, and October 1, 2020.

The mortality data were collected from the WHO country's daily reports and some obtained online data collection.

Similarly, the neighbors of peer A are peers' B, and C. Formation and discovery of peers belonging to some specific communities are significantly dependent on how peers declare and use their common \"interests\" (Khambatti et al., 2002) . Firstly, we define attributes as a method of declaring an interest, and then we use these attributes to discover affected communities. Secondly, we also define another set of attributes as a method of identifying peers infected with COVID-19 viruses, and we use these attributes to trace all possible contacts made by an individual peer within the designated smart spaces of community. Therefore, two things are involved in the peer-to-peer network machine learning based CT model, first is the identification of communities where COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, and second is the identification of infected COVID-19 virus peers together with all their contacts.",

Therefore, the hybrid machining learning based HRI algorithm is different from the classical HRI algorithm.

The machine learning based HRI algorithm incorporates the main features of contact tracing strategies, which include; the number of contacts per identified infectious case of COVID-19, the likelihood that a traced contact is infected, and the efficiency of the contact tracing process.",

These shared interests could come from the following: culture, religion, peer or age group, social activities, tribe, etcetera.

The authors further went on to classify peer attributes into three categories, namely, personal, claimed, and group. The main reason for these classifications is as a result of privacy and security concerns. A full set of peer attributes refers to a collection of personal peer attributes, and subsets of the peer's personal attributes are referred to as the peer claimed attributes. The personal attributes disclose complete attributes information about the peer, while the asserted attributes only disclose those attributes that the peer wishes to make public. The group attribute is a location or affiliation oriented and is needed to form a physical basis for communities. Table 3 provided examples of these three attribute classes.",

Structuring the population sizes of each group mixing will differ from places to places or country to country, depending on some parameters that might be linked to either social, cultural, or religious beliefs. Table 4 shows three contact types for the three group mixing. .

In view of the possible individual network contact types within a confined smart space, the close contacts type defines the first level, which is the most recurrent interaction type among family members within a confined smart space. On the one hand the casual contacts which is the second level type of contact, represent a social relationship that often occurs among friends at a smart recreational center, sit out spaces, neighbors at a shopping malls, or children at learning institutions such high schools and universities. However, these types of contacts are less regular and cherished as compared to the first level type of contact. More so, it more restricted to a specific network of related individuals that are connected via a predefined smart spaces, including friends, coworkers, etc. (Classen et al., 1999; Raffalli, Sepkowitz, & Armstrong, 1996) . For the proposed machine learning contact tracing model, we limit the domain of level one type of contact to each neighborhood's residents and assume a limited period of twelve months for the duration of the interactions. Finally, the third type of contact or interaction, which is the random contacts are used to represent interactions among individuals at smart spaces, for example, at smart bus or train stations, institutions, etc. This type of contact network has a very limited duration of interaction that would last for a period of one month. This type of contact usually accounts for the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission among non-related people in the whole smart community.",

The propose machine learning solution framework integrated different task to fight COVID-19 in the smart cities from different dimension such as predicting COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity, detecting COVID-19 severity, predicting COVID-19 mortality, COVID-19 resource allocation, COVID-19 drugs discovery, COVID-19 contact tracing, social distance, detecting wearing of mask, detecting COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator, predicting COVID-19 patient that is beyond medical intervention and triage COVID-19 patients. The paper presented a comprehensive guide for implementing the machine learning framework in smart cities. We believed that the solution framework has the potential to automate the measures of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in smart cities from multiple dimension to ease the fatigue of the healthcare workers due to very high number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical attention simultaneously and provide widespread access to quality healthcare system. In addition, we hope that the proposed smart city machine learning based framework for combatting COVID-19 will serve as essential guide to the research community in developing a more compartmentalized .

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is a learning algorithm that is employed when there are difficulties in finding the labeled sample since it does not rely on the previous training for mining the data. Thus, there is an existence of only one observation. The primary purpose of unsupervised learning is to find a correlation that exists between the samples behind the observation. One of the notable examples of unsupervised learning is a clustering system. The semi-supervised learning exists in-between the supervised and unsupervised learning. Thus, it is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning that uses a small amount of labelled data and a huge amount of unlabeled data (Tsur, Davidov, & Rappoport, 2010) during the training process. Semi-supervised learning was created due to the high cost of labeling data in some complex applications.

The study utilized various global datasets that included Chinese disease-infected areas. Various retrospective deep learning experiment was performed to analyze the system performance in the identification of speculated thoracic Computer Tomography features of the COVID-19 for the evaluation of disease evolution in every patient. One hundred and fifty-seven(157)patients were globally selected from the US and China for the testing sets. However, the classification performance of the model attained 0.996% AUC, 92.2% specificity, and 98.2% sensitivity on Chinese control and infected patient datasets. This shows that the proposed model can attain high predictive performance in the identification, tracking, and quantification of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, (Narin, Kaya, & Pamuk, 2020) on their proposal for automatic prediction of COVID-19, employed a deep convolutional neural network built on Chest X-ray image and pre-trained transfer model that includes InceptionV3, Inception-ResNetV2 and ResNet50 models to attain higher predictive performance with negligible X-ray dataset. However, the experimental results attained an optimum result of 98% accuracy on ResNet50 pre-trained model out of the three selected models, which shows that the research can assist doctors on decision making in clinical practice based on the obtained result as it can employ transfer learning to detect the early stage of the COVID-19 on the infected patients.",
