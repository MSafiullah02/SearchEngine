This cascade leads to loss of functional lung tissue. Chest radiography demonstrates bilateral opacities. As ARDS progresses, lung compliance decreases, hypoxemia ensues, and patients can progress to ventilator dependence (3, 4) .",

One of the most common methods for doing this is careful monitoring of the plateau pressure ( Figure 2) . Although the peak inspiratory pressure represents the pressure to which the proximal large airways are exposed, the plateau pressure is representative of the pressure present in the alveoli at end inspiration, and thus is an indicator of transpulmonary pressure, lung overdistention, and ventilator-induced lung injury. Plateau pressure is measured after a 0.5-to 1.0-s inspiratory pause maneuver. If the plateau pressure is >30 cm H 2 O, consider further reducing the delivered tidal volume.",

Given the significant overlap between cardiology and critical care, cardiologists may be among the first physicians asked to step in to fill this shortage. If and when this occurs, a basic framework for recognition of acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and initial ventilator management is imperative. The following is a brief review of ARDS and an overview of ventilator management designed to help ensure physician comfort and patient safety. Data from China suggest respiratory findings are common in patients who are positive for COVID-19. Pneumonia was present in 91.1% of cases, and 3.4% of all patients developed ARDS. Oxygen therapy was used in 41.3% of patients, and infection required mechanical ventilation in 6.1% of those infected (1).",

Mild ARDS, moderate ARDS, and severe ARDS are defined as a PaO2/FiO2 of 200 to 300, 100 to 200, and <100, respectively (5).",

Institution-specific policies should guide the decision for use of noninvasive ventilation versus early endotracheal intubation in this population. INVASIVE MECHANICAL VENTILATION Invasive mechanical ventilation ensures oxygenation and ventilation via positive pressure delivered through a secure airway. In the intensive care unit, most patients undergoing mechanical ventilation will have an endotracheal tube (ETT) in place. This is a polyvinylchloride tube that is placed between the vocal cords and into the trachea. ETTs have various internal diameters. Most adults will be intubated with a 7.0-to 8.0-mm ETT. The smaller the internal diameter, the higher the resistance to airflow, and the more the patient and/or the ventilator will have to work to overcome this resistance. ETTs have inflated cuffs (balloons) that occupy the space of the trachea, ensuring all gas exchange occurs via the ETT, while offering some protection to the lung from gastric and oral secretions. On chest radiography, the distal end of the ETT should be 4 AE 2 cm above the level of the carina to ensure correct placement. After placement of the ETT, auscultation for bilateral breath sounds is imperative. A chest radiograph should be ordered immediately to further confirm correct tube location. In recent years, various taxonomies have been developed to describe the different types of ventilator breaths. In this taxonomy scheme, each ventilator mode is first named by its control variable, or the variable manipulated by you, the operator. This is most often either pressure or volume. The second variable in this scheme is breath sequence. This is based on whether the patient or the machine trigger (initiates) and cycle (terminates) the breath. When all breaths are triggered and/or cycled by the machine, this is continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), whereas synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation allows the patient to take spontaneous breaths between mandatory breaths (9). Assist-control (AC) ventilation, a form of CMV, is among the most common ventilator modes in the modern intensive care unit. In AC ventilation, the physician chooses to control either the pressure or volume delivered by the ventilator. In pressurecontrol (PC) ventilation, a set pressure is delivered to the patient with each breath, whereas a volumecontrol mode delivers a specific volume. In AC modes, the ventilator will then deliver this prespecified volume or pressure for all breaths, regardless of whether the breath is triggered by the machine or the patient. These modes are most frequently referred to as volume control (VC), PC, VC-CMV or PC-CMV. In all AC ventilation, the operator additionally chooses the FiO2, the PEEP, and the minimum respiratory rate. PEEP provides a continuous endexpiratory pressure to maintain alveolar recruitment. Taken together, PEEP and the FiO2 are variables that directly affect oxygenation. Carbon dioxide clearance (i.e., ventilation) is maintained by the minute ventilation, which is a product of the respiratory rate and tidal volume. No compelling data exist to support the use of one mode over another, suggesting that nonintensivist Gage et al. use whichever mode they are most familiar with. AC is more typically used at the onset of respiratory failure, as it is more likely to relieve the patient from respiratory work. Positive-pressure ventilation relies on an understanding of respiratory system compliance. Pulmonary compliance is defined as the change in volume over inspiration (tidal volume delivered) divided by the change in pressure from end-inspiration to endexpiration (plateau pressuretotal PEEP). When using a PC mode of ventilation, a given amount of positive pressure is introduced into the lungs and the delivered tidal volume then depends on the lung compliance. Conversely, in a VC mode, a given tidal volume is administered by the ventilator and the resultant pressures are dictated by the patient's",
