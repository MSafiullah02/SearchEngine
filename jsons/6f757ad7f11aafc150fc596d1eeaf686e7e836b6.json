A total of 24 questions cover the areas of demographics, their home situation, social contact behavior, personal economic impact, their workplace situation and their health. The survey was responded to by 146,728 participants over a period of 44 hours. Such a large response enables us to gain new insights, as well as an unprecedented glimpse at respondents' personal experiences and concerns during the current COVID-19 pandemic. From the analysis, we draw 11 implications for the design of public policies related to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Since that date, the number of COVID-19 cases has been growing exponentially in Spain, such that by March 30 th , 2020 there were over 85,199 confirmed cases, 16,780 recoveries and the staggering figure of 7,424 deaths, according to the official figures. On March 25 th , 2020, the death toll attributed to in Spain surpassed that of mainland China and it is only surpassed by the death toll in Italy.

First, all classes at all educational levels were cancelled in the main hotspots of the disease: on March 10 th , in the Basque Country, and on March 11st in the Madrid and La Rioja regions. All direct flights from Italy to Spain were cancelled on March 10 th . On March 12 th , the Catalan Government quarantined four municipalities that were particularly affected by the virus. On March 13 th , the Government of Spain declared a state of emergency for two weeks across the entire country, which was later extended until April 11 th . Unfortunately, different regions implemented containment measures at different times while still allowing travel to other regions, which might have enabled infected individuals to spread the virus. Since the state of emergency was established, all schools and university classes were cancelled; large-scale events and non-essential travel were forbidden, and workers were encouraged to tele-work. Despite these measures, the daily growth rate in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continued to grow. Thus, on March 30 th new mobility restriction and social distancing measures were implemented: all non-essential labor activity was to be interrupted for a 2-week period.",

The questions ask about having had contact with infected individuals, whether children are taken care of outside the home, if they have an external person coming to their house (e.g. house cleaner), for what types of activities have they left their home and what transportation means have they used.

As shown in Figure 1 , the peak was reached in the time frame between 4 PM -5 PM on Saturday, March 29 th , with around 15,000 answers per hour.
