SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by person-to-person contact in community and health-care settings.[2] This pattern of spread demands large-scale and proactive measures to avoid further widespread dissemination. SARS-CoV-2 survives on contaminated dry surfaces and fomites, which facilitate hand to mucous membranes (of the mouth, nose, and eyes) spread.[3,4] This emphasizes the significance of in-depth knowledge about the perseverance of coronavirus on inanimate surfaces.[5] Various fixatives and biocidal agents are widely used in health-care settings including cytopathology laboratories which may impact (and help negate) the spread of this virus.[6,7]",

A report studying different types of clinical specimens from patients (most cases 1\u20133 days after hospital admission) detected a positive PCR test in about 1% (n = 307) of blood samples, suggesting the systemic nature of the disease in at least a portion of the cases.[9] This study also reported positive results in 29% (n = 153) of fecal samples.[9] Although tests based on PCR have been reported positive in non-respiratory specimens, it does equate with infectivity and so the non-respiratory route of viral transmission is possible but is not proven at this stage.",

This test amplifies viral RNA in a patient\u2019s specimen for the detection of SARS- CoV-2 genetic material.[10] False negatives are possible due to multiple variables including simple technical errors, inadequate collection, improper handling, and shipping. Other possibilities for incorrect results include flawed key reagents in the kit.[11] One study comparing rRT-PCR with computerized tomography (CT), reports that the sensitivity of the test is only 70%.[12] Further compounding the issue, the sensitivity may be lower in some symptomatic cases due to a smaller viral load,[13] but usually the viral load is higher in the early stages of the disease. However, newer tests suggest higher sensitivity with the potential of false positives due to very high sensitivity and possible cross contaminations during the pandemic with the widespread presence of virus (at the level of collection of sample and later during the technical procedure).",
