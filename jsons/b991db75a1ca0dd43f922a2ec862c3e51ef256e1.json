As new pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus, human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, human herpesviruses HHV-6 and HHV-7, and polyomaviruses, have emerged, it is fundamental to determine the significance of the newly discovered viruses and their role in the transplantation field.

In some disease entities, hematopoietic cell transplantation corrects the inherited or acquired deficiencies in the normal production of hematopoietic cells or in the immune function. In other cases, it rescues hemopoiesis after high-dose chemoradiotherapy for malignancy or promotes powerful graft versus leukemia effect through adoptive immunotherapy [Math\u00e9 et al., 1965; Kolb et al., 1990] .",

Infection is the main cause of death after stem cell transplantation, especially after allogeneic transplant. Supportive care has been the major concern in order to diminish infectious complications. The use of growth factors for the rapid hemopoietic engraftment has reduced the aplastic phase and consequently the neutropenic febrile episodes [Hughes et al., 2002] . The occurrence of infectious complications roughly follows the pattern of immune reconstitution, which is highly influenced, after allogeneic transplantation, by acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) [Billingham, 1968] . The increasing use of alternative donors has led to intensified immunosuppressive regimens against acute and chronic GVHD, which further modified the timing of fungal and viral infections. Once a new approach in hematopoietic cell transplant is undertaken, new infectious complications can be observed [Cordonnier and Maury, 2007] .",

The major disadvantage of haploidentical transplants is the late immune reconstitution and the high cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection rate. In an effort to enhance immune reconstitution, scheduled genetic engineered donor lymphocyte infusions with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase suicide gene are administered and can be destroyed by the drug ganciclovir, in the presence of GVHD [Bonini et al., 1997] .",

The main advantages of the cord blood transplantation are: (1) the graft is ready for use as it is already prescreened for infections and HLA before cryopreservation and (2) it can be applied even in HLA disparity due to low immunogenicity. Nevertheless, there are disadvantages of the cord blood graft, which are as follows: (1) the low stem cell counts, prolonged neutropenia, and increase of infections and (2) the lack of access to donor lymphocyte infusions for the management of relapse.

Patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation post reduced intensity conditioning appeared to have shorter neutropenia period, fewer bacteremia episodes as well as viral infections in the first 100 days, compared to those transplanted with myeloablative regimens [Baron et al., 2004] . Furthermore, the number of severe viral infections, such as CMV reactivation and CMV disease, was lower in the first 100 days, while the incidence of invasive aspergillosis was similar between the two types of transplants in the first year [Fukuda et al., 2003] . The CMV infection remains a severe complication in these patients, especially in the late post-transplant period. CMV infections, the major fatal threat for transplanted patients, are prevented in CMV seropositive patients with either prophylactic or preemptive antiviral treatment with ganciclovir-foscarnet. It is noteworthy that early detection of all viruses is of great importance as the best management policy remains the lowering or gradual tapering of immunosuppression [Kontoyiannis et al., 2008] . In addition, one of the major achievements is the recognition of the importance of risk assessment for the development of post-transplant viral infections. This assessment is made for several viruses through pre-transplant detection of the viral status of the patient and for several viruses of the donor too [Ljungman, 2007] .",

Therefore, viral infections remain the most significant predictors of the transplant outcome, as they are still the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Over the years, major improvements in the post-transplant management of viral infections have been achieved, especially in well-recognized pathogens as CMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and influenza viruses. The development of new diagnostic molecular techniques has led to the recognition of new viruses in transplanted patients. This review attempts to describe the role of these emerging viruses, such as HMPV, human bocavirus, human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, human herpesviruses HHV-6 and HHV-7, and polyomaviruses in hematopoietic graft recipients (Table I) .",

Both symptomatic and asymptomatic upper and lower respiratory tract disease occur in immunocompetent young or older adults and residents of a long-term nursing care facility, with clinical features similar to those seen in adults infected with RSV (i.e., infection of the upper respiratory tract, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, otitis media). Severe disease activity has been associated with HMPV infection in immunocompromised patients [Kahn, 2007] . In hematopoietic transplant recipients HMPV disease has been reported to be presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including fever, nasal congestion, and cough. Once pneumonia developed, rapidly progressive pulmonary infiltrates, accompanied frequently by hypotension, septic shock, or both, were observed [Englund et al., 2006] . Recently, Kamboj et al. [2008] found that HMPV infections in cancer patients caused a number of unspecific respiratory symptoms but they did not observe any fatal cases of respiratory HMPV infections in their series. In a recent study, bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 157 immunocompromised patients with atypical pneumonia were examined and HMPV was detected in a male patient undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation due to chronic myeloid leukemia. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed because of severe aggravation of the atypical pneumonia and fatal pulmonary failure 10 days after admission [M\u00fc ller et al., 2009] .",

Disseminated (nasopharyngeal aspirates, serum and feces) HBoV infection was reported in a child after stem cell transplantation, presenting pneumonia with perihilar infiltrates [Schenk et al., 2007] . HBoV was the sole pathogen found in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of an adult immunosuppressed patient with malignant B-cell lymphoma and a severe infection with long-lasting fever and pneumonia [Kupfer et al., 2006] . Disseminated HBoV infection was also reported in an immunodeficient child with clinical hepatitis and skin manifestations. It is noteworthy that there were no respiratory findings or other concomitant viruses detected [Kainulainen et al., 2008] . The occurrence of HBoV in febrile children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 5% [Koskenvuo et al., 2008] . In a prospective study on HBoV prevalence in 341 consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage samples from Italian adult patients, HBoV was detected in 2 out of 12 hematopoietic graft recipients, who developed pneumonia and acute respiratory deficiency [Costa et al., 2009] .",

The culture of HBoV is now possible, as it was first cultured in differentiated human airway epithelial cells [Dijkman et al., 2009] . HBoV DNA, initially found in respiratory secretions, has also been detected in stool and serum, suggesting that the virus can cause systemic infection [Kahn, 2008] . Application of serology and PCR detection in blood are expected to be very useful diagnostic tools, as HBoV infection seems to be frequently followed by asymptomatic low level virus shedding in the respiratory tract [Allander, 2008] .",
