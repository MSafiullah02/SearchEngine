            "text": "Licensed HCV drugs target either polyprotein processing (NS3\u20104A protease inhibitors) or RNA replication (NS5A inhibitors, NS5B polymerase inhibitors). To identify molecules that would complement these therapies and that may reveal novel insights into other life cycle steps, we aimed at identifying inhibitors with a novel mode of action. In addition, such molecules should not suffer from potential viral cross\u2010resistance to established drug classes. Thus, we chose a whole life cycle screening assay based on the GT2a chimeric Jc1\u2010luciferase reporter virus (JcR\u20102a),8 which interrogates HCV entry, RNA translation, polyprotein processing, RNA replication, and virus assembly (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo).6 Because inhibitors of the influenza A virus M2 ion channel have been used to treat humans and because HCV p7 is an ion channel protein essential for virus production, we screened a library of 23 compounds including several clinically approved ion channel inhibitors used to treat heart or neurologic conditions (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo). Fifteen compounds inhibited HCV entry, assembly, or release (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo). Flunarizine displayed a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 388 nM (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo) and a median cytotoxic concentration value of 10.85 \u00b5M, which is equivalent to a therapeutic index (median cytotoxic concentration/IC50) of >25 (Fig. 1A). Flunarizine has recently emerged as an anti\u2010HCV inhibitor in independent screening campaigns.9, 10, 11 However, its mode of action remains unclear. Moreover, it has not been explored if this molecule is antiviral in primary human hepatocytes and in vivo.",

Virus\u2010encoded F\u2010Luc activity was decreased by more than 10\u2010fold at a dose of 1.3 \u00b5M, whereas cell\u2010encoded G\u2010Luc expression was not affected, thereby indicating absence of cytotoxicity (Fig. 1B). In contrast, addition of flunarizine to HCV RNA\u2013transfected cells did not reduce release of infectious virus particles as determined by a core\u2010specific enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay and limiting dilution assay (median tissue culture infective dose) (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo).

Thus, flunarizine selectively inhibits entry of authentic, cell culture\u2013derived HCV (HCVcc) but not of HCVpp. Moreover, it does not inhibit RNA replication or virus assembly (Fig. 1A; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo).",

Flunarizine significantly inhibited de novo production of infectious virus at both 24 hours and 48 hours after inoculation compared to inoculation in the presence of solvent (Fig. 1C). Finally, we administered flunarizine to HCV cell entry reporter mice, which express crucial human cofactors for HCV entry and carry a luciferase reporter gene that is activated by CRE recombinase.12 When these animals were challenged with infectious Jc1 expressing a CRE recombinase, flunarizine serum levels reached an average of 133 nM, which is close to the in vitro median effective concentration value described above. Importantly, at this dose HCV\u2010CRE\u2010dependent activation of luciferase expression was significantly repressed (Fig. 1D).

Therefore, Huh7\u2010Lunet/hCD81/G\u2010Luc cells were inoculated with chimeric HCV viruses in the presence of increasing doses of flunarizine (Fig. 2A). All non\u2010GT2 strains displayed resistance toward this drug with IC50 values more than an order of magnitude greater than Jc1. The GT2b isolate showed an intermediate phenotype, with an IC50 value of 3.69 \u00b5M; and both GT2a isolates, JFH1 and Jc1, were highly susceptible, displaying IC50 values of 0.37 \u00b5M and 0.22 \u00b5M, respectively. To map the determinants of flunarizine susceptibility, we shuffled viral core to NS2 proteins between the resistant Con1 (GT1b) and the susceptible Jc1 (GT2a). Transfer of Con1\u2010derived p7 into Jc1 did not render the resulting virus (Jc1/Con1\u2010p7) resistant to flunarizine (Fig. 2B). In contrast, insertion of the Con1\u2010derived E1 and E2 proteins into Jc1 did confer flunarizine resistance to Jc1/Con1\u2010E1\u2010E2. Conversely, replacement of the Con1\u2010derived E1 and E2 sequences by those of Jc1 rendered the Con1 chimera (Con1\u2010/J6\u2010E1\u2010E2) susceptible to the drug (Fig. 2B). Therefore, susceptibility to flunarizine is governed by determinants resident in the E1 and E2 genes. Likewise, when we exchanged structural proteins, p7 or NS2 between J6 (GT2a) or J8 (GT2b), all viruses carrying the J6 E1 and E2 genes displayed greater susceptibility to flunarizine compared with those harboring the J8\u2010derived glycoproteins (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo). A chimeric virus carrying J8\u2010derived E2 in the backbone of Jc1 produced infectious virus and exhibited partial resistance to flunarizine, indicating that determinants in both E1 and E2 influence susceptibility to this drug (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo). Next, we used HCV particles trans\u2010complemented with primary E1 and E2 gene sequences from GT2a\u2010infected and GT2b\u2010infected patients.13 Also, these clinical GT2a isolates were susceptible to flunarizine, whereas the GT2b isolates were resistant (Fig. 2C). Finally, we created HCV trans\u2010complemented particles carrying E1 and E2 proteins from six additional GT2 subtypes including d, e, k, m, q, and r. All of these strains were susceptible to inhibition by flunarizine, albeit to variable degrees (Fig. 2D). Collectively, this indicates that flunarizine interferes with HCV entry by targeting viral E1 and E2 protein function(s) of almost all GT2 subtypes tested and with a clear preference for GT2 over other viral genotypes.",

To explore this, we evaluated neutralization of the flunarizine\u2010resistant virus by potent monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization by the E2\u2010targeting HC\u201011 and AR4A antibodies was significantly enhanced by the flunarizine resistance mutations (Fig. 3D).

Because flunarizine resistance was reached at a time point similar to resistance to inhibitors of endosomal acidification (e.g., concanamycin A), this suggested that flunarizine inhibits a late entry step. To explore this further, we used an HCV plasma membrane fusion assay where cells are pretreated with concanamycin A to prevent viral entry and membrane fusion by the normal route through acidified endosomes (Fig. 4).7 Under these circumstances, HCV fusion and thus productive infection can be triggered by briefly exposing virus inoculated cells to a low pH buffer. Because HCV membrane fusion requires receptor interactions including binding to CD81,14 the virus is receptive to this exogenous trigger (low pH buffer) only after incubation of approximately 1 hour at 37\u00b0C.7 Thus, Huh7\u2010Lunet/hCD81 cells were continuously treated with concanamycin A and additional drugs were added either directly after virus inoculation and throughout the experiment until 4 hours post\u2013temperature shift (Fig. 4A, protocol I), only during the incubation with low pH buffer (protocol II), or only directly subsequent to the fusion triggering low pH wash (protocol III). A buffer with neutral pH 7 was used to control that productive infection fully depends on low pH\u2010induced fusion. As expected, HCV infection only occurred when cells were exposed to low pH buffer because only then was luciferase expression above the background of uninfected cells detected (Fig. 4B). When DMSO was added to the cells according to protocol I, II, or III, the low pH wash resulted in high luciferase activity, approximately 50\u2010fold above the background of mock infected cells or virus inoculated cells treated with the neutral pH buffer (Fig. 4B). Addition of bafilomycin A1, which like concanamycin A prevents acidification of endosomes, did not have an antiviral effect, regardless of the administration protocol. This confirms that HCV can only access cells by exogenous administration of low pH, independently of endosomal acidification. Moreover, all inhibitors had completely lost antiviral activity when applied directly after the low pH fusion trigger, indicating that they exert their antiviral activity by blocking HCV entry during or upstream of membrane fusion (Fig. 4B, protocol III). Both BJ486K and flunarizine reduced HCV infection essentially to background levels when administered directly after virus inoculation and thus when present during virus trafficking at the cell surface (1 hour 37\u00b0C) and the low pH fusion treatment. However, only flunarizine was fully antiviral when added selectively during the 5\u2010minute low pH washing step (Fig. 4B, protocol II). Interestingly, viruses carrying the two E1 resistance mutations were no longer inhibited (Fig. 5C), whereas the E2 mutation alone was not sufficient to confer flunarizine resistance in this fusion assay. These results indicate that flunarizine specifically targets HCV membrane fusion and that resistance is primarily mediated by two mutations within E1.",

            "text": "Flunarizine is a T\u2010type Ca2+ channel inhibitor and belongs to the group of diarylmethyl piperazine drugs. A range of structurally related drugs (e.g., pimozide) are known which also block Ca2+ ion channels and are used as antipsychotic drugs.16 Moreover, phenothiazines such as fluphenazine and trifluoperazine are also important drugs in which the phenothiazine group resembles the biarylmethyl group. Indeed, all of these have emerged as potent HCV inhibitors in our screening (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo). Therefore, we explored if inhibition of Ca2+ ion channels in general is essential for the antiviral activity of these molecules. Furthermore, we investigated if these drugs inhibit HCV through an antiviral mechanism comparable to flunarizine. To address this we explored the influence of 1,2\u2010bis(o\u2010aminophenoxy)ethane\u2010N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2010tetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, two Ca2+\u2010chelating agents, which sequester intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ pools, respectively, on the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Although both 1,2\u2010bis(o\u2010aminophenoxy)ethane\u2010N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2010tetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid were administered at high doses, they did not modulate the antiviral activity of flunarizine, indicating that inhibition of HCV entry by flunarizine does not depend on availability of Ca2+ (Fig. 6A). Next, we explored if mibefradil,17 penfluridol,18 or NiCl2,19 three well\u2010established inhibitors of T\u2010type Ca2+ channels, interfere with HCV infection. None of these molecules inhibited infection of parental HCV or flunarizine\u2010resistant HCV (Fig. 6B). In contrast, both phenothiazines (fluphenazine and trifluoperazine) and pimozide preferentially inhibited the parental virus and were less active against the variant with flunarizine resistance mutations. The antiviral activity of BJ486K20 and curcumin,21 two molecules that inhibit HCV cell entry by different molecular mechanisms, was not influenced by these mutations (Fig. 6B). While this work was in preparation, Chamoun\u2010Emanuelli et al. reported that selected phenothiazines inhibit HCV entry potentially by increasing the fluidity of cholesterol\u2010rich membranes.22 This prompted us to explore if viral susceptibility to flunarizine correlates with susceptibility to modulation of membrane fluidity achieved by depletion of cholesterol using methyl\u2010beta\u2010cyclodextrin. Interestingly, we observed that Jc1 was significantly more susceptible to cholesterol depletion than a GT5a virus, which has high endogenous flunarizine resistance (Fig. 6C). Moreover, also the flunarizine\u2010resistant Jc1 variant was significantly more resistant to depletion of cholesterol compared with the parental Jc1 (Fig. 6C). This suggests that differences in the dependence of the HCV fusion machinery on membrane properties may in part determine susceptibility to flunarizine, phenothiazines, and pimozide. However, in our experiments these drugs did not modulate membrane fluidity (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo) or cellular cholesterol content (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo), suggesting that other membrane changes are responsible for fusion inhibition.",

Finally, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, and pimozide displayed a preference for GT2a over the other GTs, very similar to flunarizine. However, pimozide and fluphenazine displayed a much improved cross\u2010genotype coverage, with IC50 values below 10 \u00b5M for GT3a, GT5a, and GT7a in the case of pimozide and for GT3a, GT6a, and GT7a for fluphenazine (Fig. 7). In conclusion, the antiviral activity of flunarizine and related compounds is not directly linked with their ability to inhibit Ca2+ ion channels.

Firstly, these drugs, which all inhibit cellular Ca2+ channels, may prevent fusion by changing Ca2+ fluxes in HCV target cells and/or by directly blocking the interaction of HCV with a Ca2+ channel critical for membrane fusion. However, not all tested Ca2+ channel targeting drugs also arrested HCV infection. Moreover, sequestration of Ca2+ did not modulate the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that inhibition of Ca2+ channels by these drugs, which then would be used by HCV in a genotype\u2010dependent fashion, is responsible for the anti\u2010HCV activity of this class of molecules.",

            "text": "Secondly, it is possible that flunarizine, pimozide, and phenothiazines directly bind E1 and E2, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion. The genotype specificity of the antiviral activity supports this notion as sequence variation may prevent drug binding. However, HCVpp carrying the same viral envelope proteins as flunarizine\u2010susceptible HCVcc particles are not inhibited by flunarizine, arguing against this. Also, Chockalingam et al.10 and Hu et al.11 reported resistance of HCVpp to flunarizine, leading them to conclude that flunarizine is likely not an entry inhibitor. Our data, however, show that flunarizine inhibits entry of authentic HCV at the stage of membrane fusion. This highlights an as yet unexplored difference between the mode of HCVpp and HCVcc membrane fusion, which may arise because HCVpp are produced in 293T cells rather than in human liver cells. Consequently, HCVpp could differ in lipid and lipoprotein composition, thus affecting cell entry. Notably, it has been reported that receptor usage can differ between HCVcc and HCVpp, with only the former using the Niemann\u2010Pick C1\u2010like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor for cell entry.23 Furthermore, Meertens and colleagues observed that cholesterol depletion of the host cell had no effect on the entry of HCVpp, whereas it was antiviral for HCVcc.24 Therefore, the resistance mutations identified by us could be part of a direct drug binding site, or they could modulate the conformation and function of E1 and E2 in membrane fusion, which seems to be exquisitely cholesterol\u2010dependent for HCVcc particles. The E1 domain from residue 264\u2010290 has previously been implicated in harboring an HCV fusion peptide based on phylogenetic comparison with related flaviviruses, sequence conservation, and hydrophobicity.25 The observation that drugs that specifically inhibit membrane fusion select for viral resistance in this region indirectly supports the notion that this peptide is critical for fusion. The crystal structures of E2 did not reveal evidence for a major role of E2 as a fusion protein, so E1 is now assumed to be the primary fusion protein of HCV.26, 27 This is supported by earlier studies.28, 29, 30\n",

In fact, while this work was in preparation Chamoun\u2010Emanuelli et al. reported that this was the case for specific phenothiazines including fluphenazine and trifluoperazine, also characterized by us.22 Intriguingly, we observed a correlation between HCV susceptibility to flunarizine and susceptibility of HCV to cholesterol depletion\u2013induced changes in membrane properties. This result is compatible with the notion that flunarizine and pimozide, like the phenothiazines, modulate membrane fluidity and that this is the antiviral principle of these groups of compounds. In turn, the genotype\u2010specific antiviral activity of these molecules implies that viral strains differ with regard to membrane requirements during fusion. The cholesterol depletion experiment reported here, which shows that Jc1 is more susceptible to cholesterol depletion compared to the flunarizine\u2010resistant Jc1 and to a flunarizine\u2010resistant strain (GT5a), supports this notion. However, unlike Chamoun\u2010Emanuelli et al. but consistent with Thomas and Verkleij, we did not observe a modification of membrane fluidity by flunarizine and related drugs.31 This discrepancy between studies may be due to differences in the assay setup including the composition of liposomes (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo). Moreover, flunarizine and related compounds did not extract cholesterol from Huh\u20107.5 cells, even upon prolonged incubation (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28111/suppinfo).",
