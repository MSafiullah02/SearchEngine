In China, the main causes of viral encephalitis are Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), enterovirus (EVs), herpes simplex virus (HSV), mumps virus (MUV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), measles virus (MV), rubella virus (RV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Burkitt's lymphoma virus and (EBV) and so on (Jmor et al., 2008, Shaw et al., 1991). Cangzhou is a prefecture-level city of Hebei province in China, which includes 14 counties and the total population is about 7,200,000. In order to know exactly epidemiological features of viral encephalitis in Cangzhou of China, patients hospitalized in Cangzhou central hospital with the diagnosis of viral encephalitis from January 2010 to December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed and 4014 patients were taken up in this research. At the same time, cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) collected in the acute phase of the patients were tested with five RNA virus associated with viral encephalitis.",

Any patients who accord with  or  can be the selected cases (Yi et al., 2010). On the basis of above criteria, 90 patients were selected for evaluation. CSF samples from the acute phase of these 90 cases were obtained and evaluated for the presence of viral RNA by our multiplex RT-PCR (Yi et al., 2010, Xiangjun et al., 2013a, Xiangjun et al., 2013b). Meanwhile, IgM antibodies of EVs, JEV, MUV, MV and RV in the CSF samples were tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Kantola et al., 2011).",

The main pathogens include JEV, coxsackie virus of EVs, enteric cytopathogenic human orphan virus, enterovirus type 71, poliovirus, HSV, MUV, MV, RV, VZV, HCMV, EBV and so on. Clinical statistics showed that only 20% of viral encephalitis was infected by DNA virus and the rest were all caused by RNA virus (Markoulatos et al., 2001) among which EVs, JEV, MUV, MV and RV accounted for more than 80% (Chunyan et al., 2007, Ziqian et al., 2008). Traditional diagnosis of viral encephalitis include isolation and culture of virus in CSF, serological indexes, electroencephalogram, imaging examination and some other biochemical and immune indexes. However, low content of virus in CSF sample, time and labor consuming of viral culture, poor sensitivity and specificity or many other reasons resulted in the diagnosis of the disease was later than clinical treatment leading to higher mortality or serious sequelae.",

Professor Gao found the tested positive rate of HSV, coxsackie virus, ECHO virus, adenovirus (ADV), HCMV and EBV with realtime fluorescence quantitative PCR (RTFQ-PCR) was as high as 67.9%, whereas coxsackie virus and ECHO virus accounted for 49.2%. For the patients who have no typical clinical symptoms or failed to identify pathogens with other auxiliary laboratory technology, PCR technology is a rapid, accurate and good method. RTFQ-PCR can more quickly, accurately definite pathogenic species, and has important significance for the treatment and prognosis (Drago et al., 2004, Kawada et al., 2004). It is a pity that the specific fluorescent primers can only be customized by commercial companies with high cost and one test for a virus. However, multiplex RT-PCR achieved the target that one specimen one test can simultaneously test various viruses or different types of one virus (Quereda et al., 2000), which has the advantages of low cost, simple operation, larger information and so on. Therefore, we used a multiplex RT-PCR method established by our laboratory in this study which can simultaneously test the five RNA viruses. Through validated by viral titer test and gene sequencing analysis, the method has good specificity and sensitivity which can reach 62.5 CCID50/ml, 250 PFU/ml, 125 CCID50/ml, 125 CCID50/ml and 125 CCID50/ml. Compared with the results of ELISA, the tested positive rate was 100% by multiplex RT-PCR, but not vice versa. That was to say the relevance ratio of RT-PCR was higher than that of ELISA, whereas distribution of the two RNA virus were the same.",

            "text": "The average annual number of patients of viral encephalitis was 1338 cases in this study and the annual incidence rate was 18.6/10 million, far higher than the epidemiologic results in other areas (Jian et al., 2013, Suna et al., 2012). And the overall curative and better rate of this study was as high as 97.4% which was not consistent with high mortality and serious sequelae of viral encephalitis. This result may be made by the following factors:  clinical diagnosis of viral encephalitis is too loose;  whether the virus mutates or the existence of different genetic background needs further studies. There are statistically significant differences among distribution ratio of patients with viral encephalitis in Cangzhou between city and countries (P\n < 0.05), which was the same with distribution ratio of patients who hospitalized in Cangzhou central hospital and also has direct relationship with medical environment and geographical position. Laboratory test results showed pathogen distributions of viral encephalitis in Cangzhou were EVs, MUV, JEV, MV and RV, which means the most common pathogens responsible for viral encephalitis in Cangzhou, Hebei province, China, were EVs and its tested positive rate is as high as 64.4%.",

If a communicable disease is identified, an outbreak may be spotted early and appropriate intervention can be made to prevent other people from becoming infected. Likewise, if a mosquito-borne virus (e.g., JEV) is identified, then extra effort can be put into mosquito control to prevent additional cases. How to develop an economic, efficient, fast and reliable diagnostic method has become an important subject for doctors from a public health standpoint. This can allow public health personnel make a difference in the community. The next step will be the development of reverse dot blot hybridized PCR which can obtain more information, be more sensitive and more accurate. Even we hope to establish new methods can simultaneously detect DNA virus and RNA virus of viral encephalitis.",
