By September 2017, over 2000 cases of MERS\u2010CoV had been reported in 27 countries, leading to at least 722 deaths.2 Although the majority of those cases were distributed on or near the Arabian Peninsula,3 a single imported case in the Republic of Korea led to an unprecedentedly large MERS epidemic between May and July 2015,4 revealing the potential for the global spread of MERS.5\n",

However, the precise human\u2010to\u2010human transmission routes of the virus remain unclear.6 As shown in Figure 1, three major possible transmission routes are known to exist for communicable respiratory infections: the long\u2010range airborne route, the close contact route, and the fomite route.7, 8, 9 The current dominant view is that MERS\u2010CoV largely spreads via the respiratory close contact route,10, 11 which is supported by evidence that most of the affected healthcare workers (HCWs) have been nurses who have had prolonged and repeated close contact with MERS\u2010CoV patients.12 Nevertheless, the possible roles of airborne and fomite transmission cannot be excluded. Research suggests that MERS\u2010CoV may be spread through long\u2010range airborne transmission. For example, the viral RNA has been detected on the entrance to air\u2010ventilating equipment,13 and the virus has been detected in air samples from patients\u2019 rooms, restrooms and common corridors.14 On the other hand, Seo et al13 and Kim et al14 detected MERS\u2010CoV RNA on objects in MERS patients\u2019 rooms and in elevators, and experiments by van Doremalen et al15 suggest that MERS\u2010CoV is able to survive on surfaces long enough for further transmission, which increases the likelihood of fomite transmission. Thus, the recommendations of World Health Organization (WHO)10, 16 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)17 on standard precaution, droplet precaution, contact precaution, and airborne precaution remain vague. A better understanding of the exact transmission mode of MERS\u2010CoV could aid the development and selection of more appropriate and effective intervention methods.",

We retrospectively analyzed the spatial pattern of infection and developed a multi\u2010agent model to simulate the possible spread of the virus from the index patient's ward by air flow, close contact, and surface touching. Table 1 lists the seven hypotheses examined in the study: three for single routes, three for two\u2010route combinations, and one for a three\u2010route combination. The dose\u2010response relationship model was used to calculate the possible infection risk for each hypothesis. A major challenge with this approach is the lack of appropriate input data, such as dose\u2010response parameters. Hence, a range of such parameters was considered with various value combinations of important parameters. Least\u2010squares fitting was carried out in 1140 scenarios to compare the distribution of the infection risk with that of the reported attack rates. The results presented below provide probable evidence for the transmission of MERS\u2010CoV in different scenarios.

In the behavior models, rules were set to regulate the time sequences for different types of behavior according to the geometry constraints and agent roles. For example, all the agents need to open the door to the room to enter the corridor, and family members take care of patients while the cleaners do cleaning work. Appendix S2: Tables S6 and S7 show the behavior frequencies and sequences of touching surfaces for the different types of behavior. The multi\u2010agent model retained the heterogeneity for each agent, so agents with the same role share the same rules but do not act synchronously. In addition, agents were endowed with an implicitly bounded intellect to make the simulations more realistic. For example, patients and family members used the public toilets in the corridor only when the toilets in the room were occupied, which influenced the effect of the public surfaces. During the computational period, as shown in Appendix S1: Fig. S1, in each time step for each agent, the agent first acquired information from the global database and then compared the acquired information with the behavior rules and made a command. According to the command, the agent remained static or performed an action. Finally, information about the agents was sent to the global database, which was updated. The global database recorded the agents\u2019 state information and the contamination states of the surfaces and air in the temporary workspace.",

When there was no wind, the wards and the corridor on the eighth floor were in a negative pressure state due to the exhaust fans in the toilets. For the predominant wind directions, namely north\u2010westerly, westerly, and south\u2010westerly (Appendix S3: Fig. S4), the wind pressure coefficients on the windows of adjacent wards were mostly positive, whereas those of downstream wards were negative (Appendix S3: Fig. S5), which contributed to larger negative pressures in the downstream wards and smaller negative pressures in the adjacent wards. Therefore, for wards of the same size, more aerosols spread to the downstream wards than to the adjacent wards. However, because the toilet exhaust fans were run at the same ventilation rates for all rooms, the negative pressures in the small rooms were higher than those in the large rooms, and thus, the infection risk in the small rooms in the adjacent wards was higher than that in the large rooms in the downstream wards (Figure 5A). The infection risk was lowest in the remote wards (Figure 5A). The remote wards had at least two zones, Zones 34 and 36, between them and the source ward (Appendix S1: Fig. S2), so the aerosol concentration was further diluted. Furthermore, during the day, the air flow could transport aerosols from Zone 34 to Zone 36 only when the wind was from the northwest (Appendix S3: Fig. S6), which meant that most of the time there were no virus sources for Rooms 8113 and 8201\u20108219. Similarly, in the remote areas, the infection risk in Rooms 8213\u20108217 was even lower than that in Rooms 8218 and 8219 (Figure 5A).",

We assumed that the nurses conducted routine rounds five times a day at 07:00, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00, and 21:00 (Appendix S2: Table S6). Because nurses do not always clean their hands after coming into contact with patients41 and handwashing is not always very effective,42 their hands may have played an important role as a mobile medium in transferring viruses from the source to the skin of subsequent patients and the surrounding surfaces. In line with this, the number of viruses spread to patients decreased from Room 8104 (the index patient's room) clockwise to Room 8103, which is consistent with the direction of the nurses\u2019 routine rounds (from Room 8101 clockwise to Room 8219). At other times, the surrounding surfaces acted as temporary sources in spreading viruses to patients, because more viruses naturally die on the skin than on environmental surfaces (Appendix S2: Table S3). In most cases, patients have the same opportunities to come in contact with common surfaces, and thus, these surfaces contribute to a uniform spatial distribution. However, in this outbreak, the environmental surfaces common to all patients were not a significant factor. The private toilets in the rooms were preferentially chosen by patients and family members (an average of 21 times/day for each room), while the common toilets in the corridor were used at a low frequency (an average of 5 times/day for each). Therefore, the overall distribution mostly complied with the direction of the routine round (Figure 5C).",

However, camel saliva has been found to spread MERS\u2010CoV to humans,11 and its classification into disorder group C and predicted hard outer shell suggest that MERS\u2010CoV is likely to be transmitted by saliva.46 Therefore, we investigated the largest virus\u2010containing droplet size d\ng in the range from 20 to 200 \u03bcm. The range for the viral load was very large, from 102 to 1011 mRNA copies/mL in the respiratory tract, with the average value of viral load during the first week after diagnosis being 5 \u00d7 107 mRNA copies/mL in fatal cases and 3.9 \u00d7 106 mRNA copies/mL in survivors.47 According to a study by Gryphon Scientific48 based on datasets from animal models of MHV and SARS\u2010CoV, we estimated the dose\u2010response parameter of MERS\u2010CoV on mucous membranes as 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22123/mRNA copy.

            "text": "This study has some limitations. First, our understanding of the multiple phenomena that govern disease transmission is not complete. For example, in our model and other models,16, 17 it is assumed that transmission is mono\u2010directional from the hands to the mucous membranes in the eyes, noses, and mouths of susceptible individuals. However, there are limited data on what happens to the particles that have been transferred to the mucous membranes, such as their residence time. Second, due to our limited knowledge of MERS\u2010CoV, some parameters in the model were not available from the literature, such as the transfer rates between hands and surfaces (Appendix S2: Table S2) and first\u2010order inactivation rates (Appendix S2: Table S3). These parameters were estimated or surrogated with data on other coronaviruses, influenza viruses, bacteriophages, or even bacteria, which could introduce errors into the results. Third, there is a lack of detailed information on individual behavior during the outbreak, especially that of the index patient. Individual differences in the behavioral modes of the nurses when visiting patients were also not considered in this study. These data are crucial for building multi\u2010agent models and influence the exposure doses via the three transmission routes. For example, if the index patient walked in the corridor, the duration of that behavior would have influenced the virus source strength of the long\u2010range airborne and fomite routes, and the frequency of the behavior would have influenced the close contact route. Fourth, our conclusions on the relative importance of the transmission routes may not always be applicable to other MERS outbreaks. For example, the contribution of the long\u2010range airborne route during this outbreak was magnified because the ventilation system was not installed in the index patient's room. Although the role of the long\u2010range airborne route may vary during different MERS outbreaks, this study supports the hypothesis of the long\u2010range airborne transmission of MERS\u2010CoV with both known data and reasonable assumptions, and highlights the importance of ventilation systems in healthcare environments. Overall, further research on the transmission mechanisms of MERS outbreaks involving laboratory measurements, observations in hospitals, and MERS outbreak analyses is needed to improve our understanding of MERS transmission.",

Our modeling suggested that long\u2010range airborne transmission of MERS\u2010CoV was the most credible hypothesis in explaining the observed data. Our long\u2010range airborne route model predicted the spatial infection pattern well, that is, the downstream wards had a higher infection risk than the adjacent wards. However, in the scenarios in which the index patient shed a more \u201ctypical\u201d amount of MERS\u2010CoV, as parameterized according to available viral load data from the literature, our model showed that the hypothesis combining the close contact and long\u2010range airborne routes better explained the observed pattern of infection on the eighth floor of Pyongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, with the contribution of the former predominant and that of the latter relatively small. Our multi\u2010agent multi\u2010route transmission model and associated approaches can be applied to studies of the transmission in outbreaks of other viruses. However, our study also reveals crucial input data, such as dose\u2010response parameters and virus inactivation rates on surfaces, need to be obtained.",
