Although these 2 agents have not been excluded in the causality of Mesoamerican nephropathy, present data do not suggest they are likely etiologic factors. In addition, aristolochic nephropathy is characterized by primary renal fibrosis with minimal inflammation50 and is not consistent with biopsy findings from the few cases that have been reported.34\n",

In support for this hypothesis, there is a geographical distribution of the disease affecting mainly rural-agricultural regions, especially those associated with sugarcane production. However, the association of Mesoamerican nephropathy with other activities (such as mining, construction, and port work),23 in which agrochemicals are not present, makes this hypothesis less likely. The difference in the number of men and women affected argues against environmental pathways of exposures, and if agrochemicals were etiologically involved, occupational exposure would be the most likely setting. Although pesticide exposure has been a major concern for workers, to date no specific agrochemical has been identified as a likely candidate for the epidemic.46 It is noteworthy that pesticides are a large heterogeneous group of hundreds of active ingredients with different chemical structures and toxicities and a diversity of uses. Pesticide use varies considerably between regions and countries and even within the same crops. It is hard to imagine that the thousands of individuals with CKD in multiple countries would have been occupationally exposed to a specific nephrotoxic pesticide, but this still cannot be ruled out. In addition, environmental exposures, for example, to the nephrotoxic organochlorine insecticide toxaphene, which was widely used in the past on rice and cotton throughout Central America, could be etiologically relevant if its toxicity interacts with another occupational exposure that predominantly affects men, such as exposure to heat and dehydration.",

However, some systemic infections may be associated with environmental exposures (reflecting bad hygiene conditions) and occupational hazards. It is well known that infectious diseases such as leptospirosis, hantavirus, and malaria may cause acute kidney injury. There is limited, if any, evidence that these agents also may cause CKD. In some Central American nations there is a high seroprevalence of leptospirosis, including in the Pacific coastal regions of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Costa Rica. There also may be significant under-reporting of cases and the real frequency of the disease could be higher. It has been hypothesized that leptospirosis may act in conjunction with other potentially nephrotoxic conditions in the genesis of Mesoamerican nephropathy.49\n",

A study published in 2010 described an association of ingesting this type of unregulated alcohol with CKD.20 The authors suggested that some \u201cpotential contamination\u201d of this product could be involved, yet no specific component or causal agent was proposed. In the past, non\u2013legally produced alcoholic products have been reported to cause gout or kidney disease due to contamination by lead, but there is little evidence that this occurs with lija. The observation that lija is not commonly drunk in El Salvador despite the presence of Mesoamerican nephropathy there16 also makes this possibility unlikely. Heavy consumption of unadulterated alcohol also can contribute to CKD by exacerbating dehydration, but to date, most studies do not support an association (see Table 1).",

NSAIDs commonly are taken as pain killers after exhausting physical activity, and intake may be increased in individuals given a diagnosis of Mesoamerican nephropathy.47 Although NSAIDs can cause acute interstitial nephritis, the more likely way they might contribute to Mesoamerican nephropathy is through their hemodynamic effects, especially the reduction of renal blood flow. This effect might be especially important in individuals who are exposed to heat and not adequately hydrated. Hence, NSAIDS are likely contributory factors for the development of Mesoamerican nephropathy.",

Sol\u00eds-Zepeda59 noted that sugarcane workers lost an average of 2.6 kg of body weight during the course of a day in the sugarcane fields, whereas workers participating in an educational hydration program did not lose weight. A study performed in Costa Rica by Crowe et al60 also found evidence for significant dehydration during work hours, as noted by urinary specific gravity >1.020 at the end of their shift, and significantly more heat stress and dehydration-related symptoms among cane cutters compared with noncutters in the same sugarcane company over the harvest period. A recently completed and as yet unpublished study in Nicaragua demonstrated increases in serum creatinine levels at the end of daily working shifts among cane cutters (Aurora Arag\u00f3n, personal communication).",

            "text": "Although volume depletion usually is thought of as causing a prerenal pattern of acute kidney injury, experimental studies in mice have suggested that recurrent dehydration may lead to chronic tubular injury with fibrosis.37 The mechanism appears to be mediated by an increase in serum osmolarity, which stimulates an increase in the polyol (aldose reductase) pathway in the kidney. This leads to some conversion of glucose in the proximal tubule to sorbitol and fructose, which then is metabolized by fructokinase to generate oxidants that cause local tubular injury. Volume depletion also may cause renal injury by other mechanisms, including decreased renal perfusion (causing tubular injury).37 In addition, repeated dehydration and exhausting physical work may be accompanied by other mechanisms of tissue injury, such as rhabdomyolysis. All these conditions often are accompanied by the intake of NSAIDs as stimulants and pain relievers, further jeopardizing appropriate renal medullary blood flow in particular and whole kidney perfusion in general. These various contributory factors may favor discrete yet repeated episodes of acute kidney injury, which in turn could be responsible for the CKD seen in the long term in this population. Further studies are needed to test this and other hypotheses. If long-term recurrent dehydration or volume depletion is a cause of CKD, it also may play a role in CKD in other countries such as Sri Lanka, where epidemics of kidney disease are being reported.61 If this hypothesis is true, Mesoamerican nephropathy may represent a disease of or exacerbated by global warming.",

Providing appropriate sources of hydration and sanitation and allowing for reasonable working shifts accompanied by periods of rest and provision of shade are all recommended strategies for prevention. Such interventions should be adequately studied for effectiveness by means of field trials. In addition, even if pesticides eventually are found not to cause CKD, there is no doubt that any potential hazards associated with their use should be minimized, and sustainable nontoxic pest control methods should be favored. Other factors that have been discussed, including limiting alcohol consumption, are an equal matter of concern that in any case should be modified and reduced to improve the general health of this population.",

This type of CKD is not due to diabetes, hypertension, or obesity. Although a variety of causes have been considered, to date there is no conclusive evidence of any specific risk factor being the cause of this epidemic. However, a likely candidate is recurrent dehydration related to occupational exposure to heat, likely exacerbated by NSAIDs or other toxins. The occupational heat exposure leading to Mesoamerican nephropathy to date has been most evident among sugarcane workers, whose social and labor conditions are part of the cause of Mesoamerican nephropathy and should be considered by policy makers and development agencies. Further studies are indicated to identify the physiologic cause, in the context of their social determinants.",
