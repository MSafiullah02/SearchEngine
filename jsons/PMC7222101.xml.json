During that night, Jewish owned properties, including synagogues, homes, and businesses were vandalized or seized, dozens of Jews were killed, and countless other Jews were physically assaulted (Steinweis, 2009). While Kristallnacht was ostensibly attributed by Nazi officials and their sympathizers as being (the logical) retaliatory outcome for the assassination of vom Roth, it was in actuality\u2014as the benefit of historical foresight reveals\u2014the pivotal, though unexpected, crisis that Hitler exploited in efforts to materially advance the antisemitic ideology that foregrounded Nazism. That is, Hitler used vom Roth\u2019s assassination to expedite Nazism\u2019s ultimate ideological objective: The Final Solution.",

Over eight decades later, such is occurring with the global pandemic of COVID-19. Namely, while worldwide attention has been, almost wholly, focused on immediate concerns on how best to contain the spread of the virus, unscrupulous populist leaders are invoking COVID-19 with ulterior, often malicious, motives. While this phenomenon is manifesting all over the world, perhaps nowhere else is it more evident than in India. Indeed, populist leaders of the reigning Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have strategically crafted a set of discourses, shrouded in the veneer of COVID-19 concerns, to promote the party\u2019s longstanding Hindu nationalist\u2014and, concomitantly, anti-Muslim\u2014ideology of Hindutva. In this essay, I label the process through which an unexpected crisis is exploited by populist leaders, the\norganization of ideological discourse.",

These ends may be the consolidation of power, the undermining of institutional systems of checks and balances, the implementation of exclusionary or injurious policies against disenfranchised constituents, the suspension of civil liberties, or a combination thereof.",

In this case, it affixed blame for the virus to India\u2019s Muslim population.

The rumors acquired wide currency among Hindu nationalists as hashtags like #CoronaJihad, #CrushTablighiSpitters, and #TablighiJamatVirus began to trend on Twitter (Gilbert, 2020; Perrigo, 2020). These rumors would become codified when it was given some level of legitimacy by various institutional actors. In this case, institutional legitimacy came when, among other things:\nOn 31 March, the Delhi Police Crime Branch formally lodged a First Information Report against Maulana Saad Kandhlawi, the great grandson of the Tablighi Jamaat\u2019s founder and the current head of the Nizamuddin Marqaz Mosque\u2014the headquarters of the organization. Saad was accused of violating the Epidemic Diseases Act for not observing the government\u2019s instituted social distancing protocols (Bisht and Naqvi, 2020);On 2 April, the Ministry of Home Affairs, blacklisted foreigners who were Tablighi members by prohibiting them from engaging in Jamaat activities (Hussain, 2020; for an overview of activities practiced by Tablighi Jamaat members, see Rauf and Prasad, 2020), and;The Indian government dedicating a specific column in its daily briefings on COVID-19 to the Tablighi Jamaat (Aproovanand, 2020).

It\u2019s clear, their aim is to infect as many people as possible with coronavirus and kill them\u201d (Ellis-Petersen and Rahman, 2020).

Last 3 months have seen an Islamic insurrection of sorts, first in the name of anti-CAA protests from Shaheen Bagh to Jamia, Jaffrabad to Seelampur. And now the illegal gathering of the radical Tablighi Jamaat at the markaz. It needs a fix!

Moral panic constructs an imaginary enemy (in this case, certain practitioners of Islam), which is presented as a ubiquitous threat to the stability of society as well as to its bona fide citizens (Cohen, 1972). Within the purview of a moral panic, many come to believe that without the eradication of the imaginary enemy, society in its existing form\u2014including its culture, tradition, religion, etc.\u2014would crumble.

Namely, while the first two stages targeted an easy but definable enemy\u2014members of the Tablighi Jamaat who were linked, however speciously, to the spread of COVID-19\u2014at this stage, the specter of violence was expanded to cover the group\u2019s body politic. To put it another way, it came to encompass all Muslims. Once the pretense of COVID-19 was no longer necessary, Muslims become undifferentiated and the Hindu nationalists\u2019 underlying ideological project of Hindutva would re-emerge more palpably.",

On 5 April, Mehboob Ali, a 22-year-old Muslim man from the village of Harewali was beaten mercilessly by others in his village. The beating was video recorded and posted on social media. During the beating, his assailants can be heard yelling and demanding answers from him: \u201cTell us your plan! Was your plan to spread corona?\u201d (Gettleman et al., 2020). On the very same day, Dilshad Muhamud, a 37-year-old Muslim man from a different village hanged himself after villagers accused him of carrying and spreading the virus. Although Muhamud had been tested and confirmed to be negative of the virus hours earlier, the social stigmatization he felt from other villagers led him to suicide. As tragic is the case of Ambreen Khan, a Muslim woman from the state of Punjab. On 10 April, Khan drove home following a work shift at a local hospital. Her vehicle was surrounded by a mob of men. She was forcibly pulled out of her, cursed at, assaulted, and molested. During the abuse, the mob can be heard chanting, \u201cgo back to Pakistan\u201d (Yasir, 2020).",

The effective appropriation of COVID-19 for political purposes generated a moral panic so intense that merely being Muslim qualified someone to being subjected to communal violence. What is perhaps most alarming, and poignant, is the fact that in all of the cases the Hindu assailants were not strangers to the Muslim victims. The beating experienced by Ali, the stigmatization felt by Muhamud, and the physical and sexual assault encountered by Khan, were committed by their respective neighbors\u2014people whom the victims lived alongside for years. This speaks to the insidiousness with which the organization of ideological discourse functions. The ideological discourse is crafted in such a way that it casts the constructed enemy to be a ubiquitous and an existential threat. The perceived ubiquitous nature of the constructed enemy ensures that fear and paranoia dictate the actions of otherwise peaceful neighbors. Fear and paranoia are evident in hearing demands from ordinary citizens who have turned violent to know the enemy\u2019s \u201cplan to spread corona\u201d or xenophobic calls to \u201cgo back to Pakistan.\u201d In sum, once the constructed enemy becomes reified in the minds of citizens, ideologues step back and watch their ideology come to fruition; all too often without having to engage in its direct execution.",

Shielded behind the veil of COVID-19, Hindutva has quickly transitioned from violent ideas to violent acts.1 Indeed, today it is an ideology that is materializing into violent acts, and the frequency of such acts risk making them seem increasingly mundane. Worst of all, still, is the fact that Hindutva\u2019s violent acts are being carried out not by a paramilitary force of the BJP but rather by ordinary citizens who have accepted, as truth, fear- and paranoia-arousing propaganda from ideologues.

The organization of ideological discourse is engendered through a three-stage process. In the first stage, surface-level validation by legitimate institutional actors confirms preconceived ideas about a constructed enemy. In the second stage, inflammatory rhetoric is deployed by populist leaders, which scapegoat that constructed enemy. These two stages culminate to create widespread moral panic in society. With moral panic firmly established, in the third stage an environment of fear and paranoia becomes susceptible to the enactment of symbolic and physical violence against the constructed enemy.",

On the contrary, each of these unexpected crises were exploited by populist leaders to justify, as well as to expedite, the very religious persecution that their ideologies always desired. COVID-19, in the case of the BJP, gave its leaders the license to continue to chart the course, though now only quicker, towards the ideological project that it always possessed\u2014a motherland based on Hindu culture and values (and without Muslims).",

At present, much energy has been preoccupied with reorganizing personal and professional lives in the era of social distancing. Most individuals\u2019 social realities have been fundamentally changed; and time and attention, understandably so, have been directed towards acclimating to the changes. Because of COVID-19, we are in the process of creating new ways of living and alternative ways of relating. Even those branches of society that are charged with tackling COVID-19 directly\u2014involving certain members in media, healthcare, academia, industry, state bureaucracy, nongovernmental organizations\u2014have mainly attended to the more technical aspects of the virus, answering important questions like how best to contain it or how to cope with its medical or economic effects. While undoubtedly these were (and remain) important questions, preoccupation with such issues has engendered an inadvertent consequence. It has caused a dangerous form of societal tunnel vision, preventing critical examination on how the very discourses over COVID-19 are being discretely packaged to accomplish problematic ideological aims. COVID-19 has proffered populist leaders around the world with the necessary cover to advance hateful ideologies that often call for violence against constructed enemies. Because this phenomenon has materialized in the shadows of the politically neutral reality of COVID-19, such ideologies have neither encountered meaningful critique nor objection.",

The anti-Muslim tenor that clandestinely foregrounds Hindutva, when it is cloaked in the concerns over the management of COVID-19, is obfuscated. Of course, it is not only countries in the Global South that are using COVID-19 to achieve political ends; as, for instance, the unsettling crackdown by Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, on basic democratic principles such as a free press and free and open elections has shown. Indeed, populist leaders in the Global South and the Global North adopt a very similar playbook to ascertain and maintain power (Masood and Nisar, 2020). For this reason, it would not take too great a leap of faith to imagine scenarios in which, for example, Donald Trump invokes COVID-19 in attempts to suspend the presidential election slated for later this year or, otherwise, has members of his republican party use the pandemic to further engage in acts of voter suppression in efforts to guarantee his second term in office.",
