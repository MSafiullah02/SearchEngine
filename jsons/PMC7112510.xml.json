The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae (Meulenberg, 2000). Accumulating evidences have revealed that PRRSV appears to develop a defensive mechanism to evade the antiviral activities of interferon (IFN): It suppresses production of type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) in infected MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages (Miller et al., 2004, Murtaugh et al., 2002); Furthermore, it diminishes IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production induced by infection with transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) or transfection with double-strand RNA (dsRNA) (Albina et al., 1998, Miller et al., 2004). However, the mechanisms used by PRRSV to suppress the production of type I IFN remain unclear.",

            "text": "Secretion of type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is a key step in the innate immune response to viral infection (Kawai and Akira, 2006, Takaoka and Yanai, 2006). PRRSV is a single-stranded RNA virus, whose genome is duplicated into dsRNA during replication. The common intermediate dsRNA can trigger a cascade of cellular events, leading to secretion of type I IFN. Initially, the pathogen-associated molecular pattern in dsRNA is recognized by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and cytoplasmic RNA helicase, such as retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (Yoneyama et al., 2004). TLR3 can detect either extracellular dsRNA or dsRNA within vesicles. Activation of TLR3 by dsRNA then leads to the recruitment of the adaptor molecule TRIF through MyD88-independent pathway (Fitzgerald et al., 2003). Alternatively, RIG-I or MDA5 serves as intracellular dsRNA receptors via DexD/H-box helicase domains. Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I or MDA5 interact with the counterpart domains of IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also known as MAVS/VISA/Cardif) (Kawai et al., 2005). Despite utilizing the different adaptors, both pathways converge to activate the two downstream kinases, Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of \u03baB kinase \u025b (IKK\u025b), resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), NF-\u03baB, and AP-1 (Fitzgerald et al., 2003). The coordinate activation of these transcription factors results in the formation of a transcriptionally competent enhanceosome that induces type I IFN production and downstream inflammatory cytokines (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995).",

In this study, we used IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter system, a sensitive method used extensively in studying IFN signaling pathway, to analyze IFN-\u03b2 expression after PRRSV infection. MARC-145 cells were cotransfected with p125-Luc and phRL-TK, followed by mock-infected or infected with PRRSV at different MOIs (1.0 and 0.1). Transfection with poly(IC) was used as positive control to test whether MARC-145 can recognize dsRNA to activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase activity was barely detectable in PRRSV-infected cells in comparison to a strong reporter signal in cells transfected with poly(IC), indicating that PRRSV infection failed to activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. To support this result, the expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR at different time points after PRRSV infection. There was no significant change in the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression in the cell extracts at the times indicated after PRRSV infection (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the result of IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay, an increased level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression was observed in cells transfected with poly(IC).",

As shown in Fig. 3A, PRRSV infection alone elevated NF-\u03baB-dependent reporter gene expression, as previously reported (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005). Similarly, PRRSV infection alone also increased AP-1-dependent reporter gene expression (Fig. 3B). However, PRRSV did not alter IRF3-dependent reporter gene expression (Fig. 3C). Again, PRRSV abrogated poly(IC)-induced expression of IRF3-dependent reporter gene. Taken together, PRRSV infection activated NF-\u03baB and AP-1, but did not changed IRF3 transcriptional activity. In addition, PRRSV nullified dsRNA-induced expression of IRF3-dependent reporter gene. This observation suggests that PRRSV suppresses IFN-\u03b2 transcription by interfering with IRF3 activity.",

IPS-1, an element lying upstream of TBK1 and IKK\u025b in the RIG-I signaling pathway, is essential for IFN production. It is likely that PRRSV inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production by suppressing IPS-1. Hence, an IPS-1 expression plasmid and the IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid were cotransfected into mock-infected or PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. In sharp contrast to the effects of IRF3, TBK1, and IKK\u025b transfections (Fig. 5), overexpression of IPS-1 diminished IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (5.9-fold) in PRRSV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells (23.6-fold) (Fig. 6A). When those cells transfected with poly(IC), IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation was only seen in the mock-infected cells.

Previous studies have demonstrated that PRRSV infection results in low type I IFN levels (Albina et al., 1998, Miller et al., 2004), which is normally produced rapidly in direct response to virus replication in infected cells, suggesting that PRRSV evolves a strategy to interfere with the type I IFN signaling pathway, and subsequently to evade the innate immune response. Like other RNA viruses, PRRSV replication has an obligatory requirement for the generation of dsRNA, which is a potent inducer of type I IFN. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the potential mechanisms used by PRRSV to prevent dsRNA-induced transcription of IFN-\u03b2, thereby antagonizing the innate immune response.",

            "text": "Initiation of IFN synthesis typically involves binding of specific transcription factors, which collectively comprise the transcriptional enhanceasome, to the positive regulatory domains in the IFN-\u03b2 gene promoter. These transcription factors include NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and members of the IFN regulatory factors (IRF) family, such as IRF3 (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995). Using plasmid constructs with the individual binding sites of these transcription factors linked to luciferase reporter genes, we showed that transcription factor NF-\u03baB and AP-1 were activated by PRRSV infection, whereas the activity of transcription factor IRF3 was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3), indicating that inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 transcription by PRRSV occurs through a mechanism involving IRF3 activity. Many viruses interact with IRF3 directly to inactivate IRF3 function, thereby suppressing IFN-\u03b2 transcription. For example, rotavirus NSP1 and human papillomavirus E6 bind directly to IRF3 (Barro and Patton, 2005, Ronco et al., 1998). PRRSV, however, appeared to employ different mechanisms. It did not inhibit IRF3-induced expression of the IFN-\u03b2 reporter gene with wtIRF3 or IRF3(5D) in this study. TBK1 and IKK\u025b are elements upstream of IRF3 in the signaling pathway. PRRSV infection did not alter IRF3 activity in cells overexpressing TBK1 or IKK\u025b. In addition, comparable IFN-\u03b2 promoter activities were obtained in cells overexpressing IRF3, IRF3(5D), TBK1, and IKK\u025b in mock- or PRRSV-infected cells. Poly(IC)-induced IFN-\u03b2 reporter gene expression, however, was significantly decreased in PRRSV-infected cells. Generally, poly(IC) is sensed by host's pattern recognition receptors, such as RIG-I and TLR3. The latter then recruit the corresponding adaptor molecule to relay the signal to TBK1 and IKK\u025b. PRRSV significantly dampened IFN-\u03b2 reporter gene expression stimulated by poly(IC) in cells overexpressing TBK1/IKK\u025b. Based on these observations, we reasoned that PRRSV did not interact with IRF3 and even did not interfere with TBK1/IKK\u025b kinases directly, and that the target of PRRSV interaction existed upstream of IRF3 and TBK1/IKK\u025b in the signaling pathway.",

The RIG-I pathway is considered to play an essential role in the sensing of incoming virus infection and directly relay regulatory signals to the host antiviral response, which was confirmed with the generation of RIG-I-deficient mice (Kato et al., 2005). In this study, IFN-\u03b2 production induced by overexpression of RIG-I, the dsRNA-sensing protein, is significantly inhibited by PRRSV, suggesting that PRRSV may target RIG-I directly or a component of the signaling pathway downstream of RIG-I and upstream of TBK1/IKK\u025b. To identify the target which PRRSV interacts with, we focused on the IPS-1 molecule, a component between RIG-I and TBK1/IKK\u025b in the signaling pathway. We showed here that IPS-1-induced IFN-\u03b2 production was blocked in PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 6) whereas elements downstream of IPS-1 remained intact. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that IPS-1 is the target with which PRRSV interfered to suppress dsRNA-initiated production of IFN-\u03b2.",

This explains why PRRSV is capable of establishing persistent infection and persisting in some animals for months (Allende et al., 2000, Wills et al., 2003). In addition to direct antiviral activities, the type I IFN also serves as an important link between the innate and adaptive immune responses through multiple mechanisms (Biron, 1998, Meier et al., 2004). PRRSV induces tardy and week neutralizing antibodies and IFN-\u03b3 production, resulting in delayed viral clearance (Lopez and Osorio, 2004, Murtaugh et al., 2002, Royaee et al., 2004). Consistent with previous studies that PRRSV infection results in inadequate induction of type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) (Albina et al., 1998, Miller et al., 2004), results in this study clearly showed that PRRSV infection interfered with RIG-I and TLR3 signaling pathway to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. This inhibition results in poor innate immune responses, which in turn, to affect the ensuing adaptive immune responses critically, including delayed IFN-\u03b3 and neutralizing antibody production, ultimately leading to viremia and establishment of persistent infection (Murtaugh et al., 2002, Overend et al., 2007).",
