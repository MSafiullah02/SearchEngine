            "text": "Peroxiredoxin (PRDX)s are thiol-specific antioxidant enzymes that reduce various cellular peroxide substrates using cysteine-containing active sites (Fatma et al., 2005, Wood et al., 2003b, Wood et al., 2003a). PRDXs refer to a family of small (22\u201327 kDa) non-seleno peroxidases currently known to possess six isozymes, namely, PRDX1\u20136 in mammalian systems (Chae et al., 2012, Wood et al., 2003a). These proteins contain either one (1-Cys PRDX) or two (2-Cys PRDX) redox-active cysteine residues (Schr\u00f6der et al., 2000, Wood et al., 2003a). The 2-Cys group includes PRDX1 to PRDX5, whereas PRDX6 is the sole member of the 1-Cys group (Immenschuh and Baumgart-Vogt, 2005, Rhee et al., 2005). Despite this difference, peroxidase activities of both 1-Cys and 2-Cys groups commonly contribute to cellular protection against oxidative stress (Dayer et al., 2008, Monteiro et al., 2007). During reaction with oxidant substrates, the cys-residues of PRDXs are oxidized (Chevallet et al., 2003, Schr\u00f6der et al., 2008). Thioredoxin (Trx) provides the electron for reducing the oxidized PRDX1-5, whereas glutathione is likely to be employed to reduce the oxidized PRDX6 (Poole et al., 2001, Turner-Ivey et al., 2013). Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes, known to catalyze peroxide reduction to balance cellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, which is essential for cell signaling and metabolism and act as a regulator of redox signaling (Chen et al., 2014, Perkins et al., 2015). Redox signaling is a critical component of cell signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, hormone signaling, immune regulation and a variety of other physiological functions (Mishra et al., 2015, Shadel and Horvath, 2015, Trachootham et al., 2008). Therefore, PRDXs are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, embryonic development, lipid metabolism and immune responses.",

            "text": "PRDXs are involved in particular pathological condition. PRDX isoforms can be considered good therapeutic targets in several cancers such as lung cancer (Jo et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2007, Soini and Kinnula, 2012, Wei et al., 2011), glioblastoma (Deighton et al., 2014, Khalil, 2007), colorectal cancer (Lu et al., 2014a, Lu et al., 2014b, Song et al., 2015), prostate cancer (Riddell et al., 2011, Ummanni et al., 2012) and ovarian cancer (Chung et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2013) where they protect tumor cells, PRDXs are involved in a variety of signaling pathways such as NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, STAT3 pathway, wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and MAPK kinase pathways (Brigelius-Floh\u00e9 and Floh\u00e9, 2011, Jo et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2014b, Riddell et al., 2010, Yun et al., 2015c, Yun et al., 2015b, Yun et al., 2015a) that are involved in cancer development. So, PRDXs can be explored as therapeutic targets as well as therapeutic tools depending on their role in particular pathological conditions. Several studies have suggested that PRDXs are related with the development of neurodegenerative diseases. PRDXs are involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD that are regulated by oxidative stress and redox signaling (Cimini et al., 2013, Yun et al., 2013). PRDXs have distinct functional roles in the brain and provide differential contributions to neuropathologic conditions. The expression patterns of PRDXs are in fact highly variable in different regions of the brain during neurodegenerative disease processes (Hattori & Oikawa, 2007). Given that oxidative damage is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, the alteration in PRDX expression would appear to be primarily a consequence of cellular resistance to the oxidative damage. PRDXs are also important regulators of inflammatory diseases such as obesity (Huh et al., 2012, Murri et al., 2013), atherosclerosis (Guo et al., 2012, Park et al., 2011) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Kim et al., 2015, Szab\u00f3-Taylor et al., 2012). Inflammation is a complex biological self-defense reaction triggered by tissue damage or infection by pathogens. Redox-regulated transcription factors and protein kinases play important roles in the regulation of inflammation. NF-\u03baB is a well-characterized redox-sensitive transcription factor important in the initiation and progression of inflammation through the production of various cytokines and prostaglandins. PRDXs induce NF-\u03baB activation that is important for the expression of inflammatory proteins (Kim et al., 2013a, Kim et al., 2013b, Riddell et al., 2010). Also, PRDXs are secreted from cells under mild oxidative stress binds Toll-like receptor 4, suggesting that PRDXs are involved in inflammation related disease (Kuang et al., 2014, Riddell et al., 2012, Shichita et al., 2012a).",

PRDX1-4 belong to typical 2-Cys and PRDX5 belongs to atypical 2-Cys group, within which all members contain two conserved cysteine residues. PRDX6 belongs to 1-Cys PRDXs subgroup in which one cysteine residue is conserved. Moreover, another subgroup named PRDX-Q was extensively found in plants, which also contains two cysteine residues. These structures reveal PRDXs to be very similar, each containing a thioredoxin fold with a few additional secondary-structure elements present as insertions. The most striking differences involve their oligomeric states. The atypical 2-Cys PRDXs are monomeric enzymes, whereas both the typical 2-Cys and the 1-Cys PRDXs are domain-swapped homodimers in which the C terminus of one subunit reaches across the dimer interface to interact with the other subunit (Hirotsu et al., 1999, Schr\u00f6der et al., 2000, Wood et al., 2003a). In the typical 2-Cys PRDXs, the resolving cysteine is located in the C-terminal arm. Three of the typical 2-Cys PRDXs crystallized as toroid-shaped complexes consisting of a pentameric arrangement of dimers ((a2)5 decamer), consistent with observations that 2-Cys PRDX dimers can form discrete higher-order oligomers (Kitano, Niimura, Nishiyama, & Miki, 1999). AhpC from Amphibacillus xylanus, another 2-Cys PRDX, also crystallizes as an (a2)5 decamer, although no crystal structure for this enzyme has been reported. The structure and sequence of the peroxidatic active site is highly conserved among the PRDX classes (Nelson et al., 2011).",

The oxidized active site cysteine of PRDX can be reduced by a cellular thiol, thus enabling PRDX to function as a locally constrained peroxidase (Rhee, Woo, Kil, & Bae, 2012). Regulation of PRDX via phosphorylation in response to extracellular signals allows the local accumulation of H2O2 and thereby enables its messenger function (Rhee et al., 2012, Woo et al., 2010). The fact that the oxidation state of the active site cysteine of PRDX can be transferred to other proteins that are less intrinsically susceptible to H2O2 also allows PRDX to function as an H2O2 sensor. PRDXs are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes, known to catalyze peroxide reduction to balance cellular H2O2 levels, which is essential for cell signaling and metabolism. The general function and mechanism of action of the PRDX redox system is in Fig. 1\n.",

            "text": "PRDX1 is a multifunctional protein originally identified as an intracellular scavenger of H2O2 (Yang et al., 2002). It has been also shown to act as a molecular chaperone with the ability to modulate the actions of numerous molecules, a regulator of transcription, or as an immunomodulator (Jang et al., 2004, O\u2019Leary et al., 2014, Park et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2010). PRDX1 is involved in redox regulation of the cells and reduces peroxides with reducing equivalents provided through the Trx system but not from glutaredoxin (Lehtonen et al., 2004, Neumann et al., 2003). The Trx system is comprised of NADPH, Trx and TrxR, and forms the Trx peroxidase system with PRDXs, and reduces peroxides by NADPH (Watanabe, Nakamura, Masutani, & Yodoi, 2010). PRDX1 is involved in this system. PRDX1 gene is mapped on chromosome 1p34.1 and is a member of the peroxiredoxin family that contains a consensus site (Thr(90)-Pro-Lys-Lys) for phosphorylation by cyclin dependent kinases (Chang et al., 2002, Gisin et al., 2005). PRDX1 is phosphorylated on Thr-90 during the M-phase, which leads to a more than 80% decrease in enzymatic activity through the Trx system (Jang et al., 2006, Neumann et al., 2009). PRDX1 is implicated in redox regulation of the cell and plays an important role in eliminating peroxides produced during metabolism that participates in the signaling of growth factors and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) through regulating the intracellular concentrations of H2O2 (Jamaluddin et al., 2010, Liou and Storz, 2010). PRDX1 is overexpressed in several cancer cells including esophageal, pancreatic, lung, thyroid and oral cancer (Gong et al., 2015, Jiang et al., 2014b, Jiang et al., 2014a, Taniuchi et al., 2015, Yanagawa et al., 1999, Zhang et al., 2012b, Zhang et al., 2012a). Concentrated PRDX1 can be secreted by non-small cell lung cancer cells via unusual pathway (Chang et al., 2005).",

            "text": "PRDX2 has a high reactivity for H2O2. An active Cys on one PRDX2 subunit forms a disulphide bond with the other subunit in the presence of H2O2 (K\u00f6nig et al., 2013, Peskin et al., 2007). PRDX2 appears to modulate growth factors and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated signaling pathway \nvia\n modulating endogenous H2O2 signaling (Zhao & Wang, 2012). When PRDX2 reacts with peroxide, the peroxidatic cysteine at the active site on one subunit is oxidized to a sulfenic acid (Low, Hampton, Peskin, & Winterbourn, 2007). Through the reduction process of disulphide by Trx, PRDX2 is regenerated and completes the cycle and Trx is in turn regenerated by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), with reducing equivalents derived from NADPH (Low et al., 2007). PRDX2 reduces hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides involved in cell protection and antiviral activity through the Trx system (Pillay et al., 2011, Sobotta et al., 2015, Watanabe et al., 2010). PRDX2 acts as a H2O2 signal receptor and transmitter in transcription factor redox regulation. PRDX2 forms a redox relay with the transcription factor STAT3 in which oxidative equivalents flow from PRDX2 to STAT3, and the redox relay generates disulphide-linked STAT3 oligomers with attenuated transcriptional activity. Cytokine-induced STAT3 signaling is accompanied by PRDX2 and STAT3 oxidation and is modulated by PRDX2 expression levels (Sobotta et al., 2015). Moon et al demonstrated that PRDX2 inhibits general immune cell responsiveness, which may be regulated by scavenging low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Moon et al., 2006). PRDX2 also enhances the activation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and phospholipase C\u03b31 in PDGF signaling via the modulation of H2O2 (Choi et al., 2005).",

PRDX3 contains a mitochondrial localization sequence, which is found exclusively in the mitochondrion, comprises 5% of the total mitochondrial matrix, and uses mitochondrial Trx2 as the electron donor for its peroxidase activity (Gourlay, Bhella, Kelly, Price, & Lindsay, 2003). PRDX3 has been known to eliminate approximately 90% of mitochondrial H2O2 and plays a key role in mitochondrial redox regulation (Chang et al., 2004). The overexpression of PRDX3 has been shown to protect cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis, and knockout studies show an increase in intracellular ROS levels and oxidative stress (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006, Nonn et al., 2003). PRDX3 protects radical-sensitive enzymes from oxidative damage by a radical-generating system, and acts synergistically with MAP3K13 to regulate the activation of NF-kappa-B in the cytosol (Lin et al., 2007). PRDX3 is involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and antioxidant functions that has been localized in the mitochondria (Huh et al., 2012, Song et al., 2011). Increased expression of PRDX3 was found to be associated with hormonal receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) (Karihtala, M\u00e4ntyniemi, Kang, Kinnula, & Soini, 2003).",

PRDX4 plays an essential role in the redox balance in the ER. The Cysteine residue of PRDX4 is first oxidized to sulfenic acid form and then forms intermolecular disulphide bond with another PRDX molecule, which can be reversed by the reducing activity of the Trx-Trx reductase system (Mehmeti et al., 2014, Tavender and Bulleid, 2010). Under oxidative stress conditions, however, the Cysteine of PRDX4 undergoes further oxidation to sulfinic/sulfonic acid forms which can only be reduced by sulfiredoxin (Srx) (Jeong, Bae, Toledano, & Rhee, 2012). The hyperoxidized form of PRDX4 loses its antioxidant property but may function as molecular chaperone to facilitate protein folding (Rhee and Woo, 2010, Zito et al., 2010). PRDX4 diminishes oxidative stress by reducing hydrogen peroxide to water in a thiol-dependent catalytic cycle (Schulte, 2011) and has been linked to the regulation of the key pro-inflammatory transcription factor, NF-\u03baB in the cytosol by a modulation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation (Haridas et al., 1998, Jin et al., 1997). PRDX4 is abundantly expressed in the pancreas, liver and heart, while the lowest expression in blood leukocytes and the brain (Schulte, 2011).",

            "text": "PRDX5 (ACR1, PMP20 or AOEB166) is an antioxidant enzyme implicated as a protective role against oxidative stress through reduction of hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides with reducing equivalents provided through the Trx system and is involved in intracellular redox signaling (Knoops, Goemaere, Van der Eecken, & Declercq, 2010). PRDX5 is a thiol peroxidase that reduces H2O2 105 times faster than free cysteine that shows hydrogen bonds in the active sites (Stephanie et al., 2014). The PRDX5 gene is mapped on chromosome on 11q13.1 that displays mitochondrial presequence and 3 cysteines involved in antioxidant activity with C-terminal peroxisomal sequence (Knoops et al., 2010, Nguy\u00ean-nhu et al., 2007). PRDX5 interacts with peroxisome receptor 1 which uses translation initiation sites to produce mitochondrial forms. PRDX5 acts as an antioxidant on different tissues under normal conditions and inflammatory processes through Trx system. The analysis of the 5\u2019-flanking region of human PRDX5 revealed the presence of several putative response elements for transcription factors involved in the response of mammalian cells to oxidative stress such as Nrf2 or NF-\u03baB (Kropotov et al., 2007, Nguy\u00ean-nhu et al., 2007). PRDX5 expression is highly increased in vitro in primary macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-\u03b3 (Abbas et al., 2009, Diet et al., 2007). Downstream of the LPS/TLR pathway, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were shown also to be major contributors to PRDX5 up-regulation (Diet et al., 2007).",

            "text": "PRDX6 belongs to the ahpC/TSA family and contains 1 Trx domain (Poole, Hall, & Nelson, 2011). Among the six mammalian members of PRDX, PRDX6 has a unique property as a bifunctional enzyme that has glutathione peroxidase and iPLA2 activities (Fisher, 2011). PRDX6 involved in redox regulation of the cell can reduce H2O2 and short chain organic, fatty acid, and phospholipid hydroperoxides (Fisher, 2011). PRDX6 plays a role in the regulation of phospholipid turnover as well as in protection against oxidative injury (Wang, Feinstein, Manevich, Ho, & Fisher, 2006). Site directed mutation analysis has clearly shown that activities of PRDX6 require two distinct active sites, namely, a Cys 47-dependent peroxidase activity and a Ser 32-dependent iPLA2 activity (Chen, Dodia, Feinstein, Jain, & Fisher, 2000). iPLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acyl ester bond of glycerophospholipides to produce free fatty acids and lysophospholipids (Markova et al., 2005, Shalini et al., 2014). PRDX6 prefers phosphatidylcholines as substrates, particularly those with arachidonic acid (AA) or palmitic acid at the sn-2 position (Chen et al., 2000, Manevich and Fisher, 2005). The ability of PRDX6 to release AA seems important, given the crucial role of AA in phospholipid metabolism and cell signaling (Hooks & Cummings, 2008). PRDX6 also protects cells via reducing peroxidazed membrane phospholipids and return to the cytosolic compartment (Wang, Feinstein, & Fisher, 2008). General properties of peroxiredoxin isoforms are briefly summarized in Table 1\n, and the cellular localization and the roles of PRDXs are in Fig. 2\n.",

            "text": "General regulatory pathway of PRDX expression is in Fig. 3\n. PRDXs are regulated at multiple levels, including both transcriptional regulation and post-translational modifications (Klotz et al., 2015, Riquier et al., 2014). PRDX1 peroxidase activity is regulated by Pin1. Pin1 facilitates the protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of PRDX1, which helps to explain the accumulation of the inactive phosphorylated form of PRDX1 in Pin1-/- MEFs (Chu et al., 2013). PRDX2 is silenced by a decreased histone H3 acetylation and DNA hypermethylation in AML (Agrawal Singh et al., 2012). A recent study also demonstrated a critical role for Foxo3a in regulating the gene expression of PRDX3 in human cardiac fibroblasts (Chiribau et al., 2008). In the promoter of human PRDX5 gene, the binding sites for both nuclear respiratory factor 1 and nuclear respiratory factor 2 have been predicted (Kropotov et al., 2007). Increased transcription of PRDX6 has been reported to be mediated by Nrf2 via an antioxidant response element-driven mechanism (Chowdhury et al., 2009). The MAPKs can mediate phosphorylation of PRDX6 at Thr-177 with a consequent marked increase in its aiPLA2 activity (Wu et al., 2009). SP-A and PRDX6 directly interact, which provides a mechanism for regulation of the aiPLA2 activity of PRDX6 by SP-A (Wu et al., 2006). Recent findings suggest that Fkbp52 deficiency diminishes the threshold against OS by reducing PRDX6 levels (Hirota et al., 2010). A recent study also suggested that 67 (phox) binds to phospho-PRDX6 and inhibits its PLA2 activity, an interaction that could function to terminate the PLA2-mediated NOX2 activation signal (Krishnaiah, Dodia, Feinstein, & Fisher, 2013). Moreover, the expression of PRDXs is induced by several factors. PRDX1 is also detected in mouse body fluids, and the secretion of PRDX1 from cultured cells was enhanced following the treatment with cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2, oncostatin M and IL1-\u03b2 (Ishii, Warabi, & Yanagawa, 2012). Another recent study showed PRDX1 and PRDX2 can be secreted from cells as disulphide homodimers in association with exosomes following stimulation by LPS or TNF-\u03b1 (Mullen, Hanschmann, Lillig, Herzenberg, & Ghezzi, 2015). PRDX1 is up-regulated in cells under oxidative stress conditions. The transcription factor Nrf2 and its inhibitor Keap1 play an essential role in the regulation of the stress-induced PRDX1 gene activation through the antioxidant/electrophile response element (ARE/EpRE) (Takeuchi et al., 2013). The expression levels of PRDX2 and PRDX3 are also up-regulated under oxidative stress conditions (Stresing et al., 2013). PRDX6 is an oxidative stress inducible protein regulated by Nrf2 and activation of the gene expression was observed in mouse lungs by hyperoxia and in cultured lung epithelial cells following treatment with H2O2 or paraquat (Chowdhury et al., 2009). In addition to oxidative stress, keratinocyte growth factor also regulates PRDX6 gene expression (Chowdhury et al., 2014). PRDX6 expression is down regulated upon serum deprivation and subsequently induced in a time-dependent manner in response to KGF, dexamethasone and H2O2 (Gallagher & Phelan, 2007). TNF-\u03b1 regulates the expression of PRDX6 to influence neuroplasticity (Zhang et al., 2015).",

PRDX1 interacts with the c-Myc oncogene and suppresses its transcriptional activity (Egler et al., 2005). Cao et al. demonstrated that PRDX1 protects the tumor suppressive function of PTEN phosphatase, likely due to the presence of a ROS sensitive cysteine in the catalytic domain, and reduces predisposition of genetically modified mice to develop Ras-induced mammary tumors (Cao et al., 2009). PRDX1-deficient mice suffer from shortened survival due to the development of hemolytic anemia and multiple tumors, including mammary carcinomas (Neumann et al., 2003). These studies suggest that the breast tumor suppressive role of PRDX1 is mediated via c-Myc or PTEN pathways.",

            "text": "Next, the tumor promoting effect of PRDX1 is well established in breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. The role of PRDX1 in breast cancer has been controversial. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of PRDX1 mRNA in human breast carcinoma is associated with higher tumor grade (Cha, Suh, & Kim, 2009), and high expression of cytoplasmic PRDX1 protein correlated with an increased risk of local recurrence after radiotherapy (Woolston, Storr, Ellis, Morgan, & Martin, 2011). PRDX1 enhances p65-mediated cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 gene expression in estrogen receptor (ER) deficient human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), and knockdown of PRDX1 can attenuate COX-2 expression by reducing the occupancy of NF-\u03baB transactivation potential of NF-\u03baB in ER-deficient-breast cancer cells (Wang et al., 2010). PRDX1 is also overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (Yanagawa et al., 2005). A recent study provides experimental evidence that overexpression of PRDX1 is involved in oral carcinogenesis by upregulation of hemeoxygenase 1 and activation of NF-\u03baB pathway (Zhang et al., 2014). PRDX1 is also related with bladder cancer. PRDX1 is highly expressed in bladder cancer tissues than in the bladder mucosa of normal controls or in normal mucosa surrounding cancer tissues (Quan et al., 2006). Jiang et al showed that PRDX1 silencing by transfection of PRDX1 shRNA significantly suppressed growth, promoted apoptosis and regulated the cell cycle in bladder cancer cells and reduced the phospho-NF-\u03baB p50 and p65 protein expression suggesting that PRDX1 is related with bladder cancers by regulation of phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB subunit (Jiang et al., 2014a, b). PRDX1 is also related with lung cancer. Abnormal up-regulation of PRDX1 by environmental redox change leads to lung cancer progression and radiotherapy resistance by controlling critical molecules (Kim et al., 2007). Another recent study suggested that down-regulation of PRDX1 significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the incidence of spontaneous pulmonary metastasis (Chen et al., 2006). PRDX1 provides resistance to docetaxel treatment through the suppression of FOXO1-induced apoptosis in A549 xenograft tumors, suggesting PRDX1 may be an attractive target in the development of more effective docetaxel-based therapies in lung cancer treatment (Hwang et al., 2013). PRDX1 is also related with prostate cancer. PRDX1 interacts with the androgen receptor and enhances its transactivation that plays a critical role in prostate cancer (Park et al., 2007). One previous study reported that hypoxia increases AR activity in prostate cancer cells, and that PRDX1, which is up-regulated by hypoxia, interacts with AR to enhance the expression of androgen-regulated genes (Chhipa et al., 2009, Park et al., 2006). PRDX1 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. PRDX1-positive rate was significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma than in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (Sun et al., 2013). Actually, PRDX1 immunoreactivity was positively correlated with tumor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and microvessel density (Sun et al., 2013). PRDX1 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, microvascular invasion, Edmondson grade, tumor capsula status, serum AFP, and tumor-node-metastasis stage (Sun et al., 2013). PRDX1 is involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tumorigenesis through regulation of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway (Gong et al., 2015). PRDX1 is also significantly increased in pancreatic cancer by upregulation of angiogenesis (Cai et al., 2015). These studies indicate that PRDX1 has a tumor promoting effect through NF-\u03baB pathway, FOXO1 mediated pathway and mTOR/p70S6K pathway in breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, which suggest that PRDX1 is a potential therapeutic target in these cancer types.",

            "text": "The tumor promoting effect of PRDX2 is well established in colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. PRDX2 is overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma tissues compared with the matched non-cancer colorectal mucosa tissues and that expression is positively associated with tumor metastasis and the TNM stage by regulation of oxidation induced apoptosis (Lu et al., 2014a). Other researchers also demonstrated that PRDX2 knockdown using a lentiviral vector-mediated specific shRNA inhibited cell growth, stimulated apoptosis, and augmented the production of endogenous ROS that led to an altered expression of proteins associated with the Wnt signaling pathway (Lu et al., 2014b). PRDX2 is also important in prostate cancer. Shiota et al demonstrated that the expression of PRDX2 is most significantly elevated among the PRDX family in prostate cancer (Shiota et al., 2011). They showed that PRDX2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm distinctively regulated AR activity and is involved in the proliferation of AR-expressing prostate cancer cells and in the progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer, suggesting PRDX2 to be a key factor in prostate carcinogenesis and in the progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (Shiota et al., 2011). PRDX2 is highly inducible by therapeutic radiation and drugs in breast cancer cells (Wang et al., 2014b, Wang et al., 2014a). Several resistant tumor cells have shown upregulated PRDX2 levels in breast cancer. PRDX2 plays a role in protecting the cell membrane from IR-induced oxidative radioresistant breast cancer cells (Diaz, Tamae, Yen, Li, & Wang, 2013). PRDX2 is also significantly upregulated in the early diagnosis of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) related fibrosis (Lu et al., 2010). PRDX2 is markedly upregulated in neutrophils of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) patients compared to healthy donors. In addition, white blood cell and neutrophil counts in RCMD patients correlated inversely with PRDX2 expression (Kazama et al., 2014). Among PRDXs, PRDX2 specifically regulates breast cancer cell colonization in lungs by acting on the oxidative and metabolic stress responses of metastatic cells (Stresing et al., 2013). PRDX2 has a strong pattern of increased expression with increasing severity of the lesion, thus PRDX2 is up-regulated in response to cervical cancer development (Kim et al., 2009). These data indicate that PRDX2 is involved in the proliferation or metastasis of cancer, involved in radio- and drug-resistance, and suggest that designing therapeutics targeting PRDX2 may offer a novel strategy for developing treatment for cancer.",

In a gene silencing study in breast cancer cells, silencing the PRDX3 gene inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in breast cancers (Chua et al., 2010). PRDX3 is also involved in prostate cancer. PRDX3 is upregulated in endocrine-regulated tumors and in particular prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer (Whitaker et al., 2013). Also, the PRDX3 protein is significantly upregulated in antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, resulting in an increased resistance to oxidative stress and failure to activate pro-apoptotic pathways (Whitaker et al., 2013). Antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cells also possess an upregulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway and resistance to H2O2-induced apoptosis through a failure to activate pro-apoptotic pathways, but knockdown of PRDX3 restored H2O2 sensitivity (Whitaker et al., 2013). PRDX3 is upregulated in response to the development of cervical cancer. The expression of PRDX3 is increased in cervical carcinoma and the pattern of PRDX3 expression in cervical carcinoma was consistent with that of cell proliferation marker, Ki67 (Hu, Gao, & Li, 2013). Nonn et al reported that PRDX3 played a drug-resistant role against drug-induced oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis of thymoma cells (Nonn et al., 2003). PRDX3 is also involved in hepatocellular carcinoma development. The overexpression of PRDX3 is associated with 94.9% hepatocellular carcinoma, and correlated with poor differentiation (Qiao et al., 2012). Also, PRDX3 is resistant to oxidation-induced apoptosis of Hep-3b cells (Wang et al., 2014a, b). After a low-dose of H2O2 treatment, the ROS level was significantly higher in PRDX3-knockdown Hep-3b cells than in controls. In addition, PRDX3 down-regulation resulted in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and increased caspase 3 activity of Hep-3b cells (Wang et al., 2014a, b). The PRDX3 is also overexpressed in ovarian cancer. Downregulation of PRDX3 upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Caspase\u20113 and Caspase\u20119, and the silencing of PRDX3 triggered cisplatin\u2011mediated apoptosis in the ovarian cancer cells through suppression of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Duan et al., 2013). These data indicate that PRDX3 is accordingly up-regulated in cancer cells to remove cellular ROS and inhibit apoptosis, which provides a favorable microenvironment for cell proliferation. Therefore, PRDX3 can be a therapeutic target for several cancer treatments.",

            "text": "The tumor promoting effect of PRDX4 is well established in lung cancer, leukemia, glioblastoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, hepatic diseases and colorectal carcinoma. PRDX4 is associated with lung cancer. Wei et al demonstrated that PRDX4 along with Srx plays a very important role in tumor progression and metastasis in lung cancer (Wei et al., 2011). Wei et al. showed that Srx preferentially binds to PRDX4 and the Srx-PRDX4 axis contributes significantly to the maintenance of lung tumor phenotype in vitro and the formation of metastases in vivo and also they suggested the Srx-PRDX4 axis in activation of intracellular phosphokinase signaling including AP-1/MMP-9 axis and MAPK signaling (Wei et al., 2011). The expression of PRDX4 is at least 1.5 fold higher in tumor cells compared to control and this finding applies most frequently to adenocarcinoma and modestly to squamous cell carcinoma (Lehtonen et al., 2004). Alteration in expression of PRDX4 results in an alteration to the rate of tumor progression and metastasis which is indicated by anchorage independent colony formation, cell migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells (Park et al., 2008). The ability of PRDX4 to promote tumor progression and metastasis is supposed to be due to its antioxidant properties (Dando et al., 2015). Alteration of PRDX4 expression is proposed to play a role in the development of different types of leukemia (Palande et al., 2011). Palande et al. found that the alteration in genomic sequence and expression level of PRDX4 is rare in acute myeloid leukemia but have found strong reduction in PRDX4 expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia (Palande et al., 2011). Also, it was suggested that due to the alteration in PRDX4 expression, the signal transduction from a myeloid growth factor receptor i.e. the granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor is affected (Palande et al., 2011). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the PRDX4 gene is fused with the AML1 gene between exon 5 and 6 of AML1 and exon 2 of PRDX4 (Zhang et al., 2004). This fusion of AML1 gene with the PRDX4 gene is supposed to play a role in the altered expression of PRDX4 in acute myeloid leukemia (Zhang et al., 2004). PRDX4 is supposed to play a role in the most aggressive primary brain malignancy (Kim et al., 2012). They found that the knockdown of PRDX4 results in reduced Glioblastoma multiform cell growth and radiation resistance along with increased ROS level, DNA damage and apoptosis in in-vitro model, suggesting the importance of PRDX4 in radiation resistance and tumor maintenance of GBM (Kim et al., 2012). PRDX4 is also studied for its role in tumor progression, cell migration and invasiveness in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (Chang et al., 2011a, b). Along with the prognostic value of PRDX4, PRDX4 can also be a good therapeutic target in OSCC by virtue of its ability to mediate cell migration and/or metastasis (Liao et al., 2011). Also, PRDX4 is secreted into an extracellular environment, therefore, its plasma concentration may be used as a molecular indicator of various cardiovascular disease and other disorders involving oxidative stress (Schulte, 2011). The increased serum PRDX4 concentration is considered as a good indicator of risk to cardiovascular disease because cardiovascular disease have higher level of oxidative stress and PRDX4 is over-expressed in these conditions (Abbasi et al., 2012). A study in a rat model of Wilson's disease has demonstrated that this disease has a lower level of PRDX4 expression as compared to normal (Ito et al., 2012). PRDX4 can protect the hepatic tissue against the Hydrogen peroxide as well as other ROS causing oxidative stress. The same study has proposed that PRDX4 can be used as a potential biomarker of hepatic diseases as the PRDX4 serum concentration in this model was found to be quite low. Genomic loss of PRDX4 in mice results in testicular atrophy due to elevated spermatogenic cell death (Iuchi et al., 2009). PRDX4 is also related with colorectal carcinoma. The expressions of the PRDX4 gene and protein were higher in colorectal carcinoma compared to those in the adjacent normal tissues and the expression intensity of the PRDX4 protein was correlated with depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis in CRC, and high PRDX4 expression was correlated with short survival time (Yi et al., 2014). These studies suggest that PRDX4 is involved in the tumor promoting effect through formation of Srx-PRDX4 via AP-1/MMP-9 and MAPK signaling, and remove cellular ROS which provides a favorable microenvironment for cell proliferation. Hence, PRDX4 can be a therapeutic target for several cancer treatments.",

PRDX5 expression is higher in the thyroid gland of patients with Graves' disease compared to multinodular goiters, and the level of expression is directly correlated with the functional status of epithelial cells, being higher in multinodular goiters, and even more pronounced in hyperthyroid tissues, such as Graves\u2019 disease (G\u00e9rard, Many, Daumerie, Knoops, & Colin, 2005). Wang et al showed that PRDX5 expression is increased in a degenerative tendon compared with normal tendon (Wang et al., 2001). They showed that while PRDX5 was localized to fibroblasts in a normal tendon, it was localized to fibroblasts and endothelial cells in a degenerative tendon (Wang et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The tumor promoting effect of PRDX6 is well established in lung cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and gastric cancer. PRDX6 has been found at higher levels in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients compared with healthy controls (Zhang et al., 2009). PRDX6 is elevated in several lung diseases including lung cancer, mesothelioma and sarcoidosis (Yun et al., 2014a, b). Invasion- and metastasis-promoting actions of PRDX6 have been found in lung cancer cells (Abbas et al., 2009). The evidence indicates that the activity of PRDX6 contributes to the invasion, promotion, and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells (Ho et al., 2010). We previously found that iPLA2 activity of PRDX6 is critical for lung tumor development in in vivo allograft (Yun et al., 2014a, Yun et al., 2014b). Our recent study demonstrated that PRDX6 promotes tumor development via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in a urethane-induced lung tumor model (Yun et al., 2015a, Yun et al., 2015b, Yun et al., 2015c). Also, PRDX6 promotes lung tumor progression via its GPx and iPLA2 activities (Yun et al., 2014a, Yun et al., 2014b). In a recent study, the overexpression of PRDX6 attenuated cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells, whereas the reduction of PRDX6 expression increased cell death in liver cancer cells (Pak et al., 2011). PRDX6 is highly upregulated in metastatic gastric cancer cells, which are relatively resistant to TRAIL as compared with primary cancer cells (Choi, Chang, & Jung, 2011). Overexpression of PRDX6 leads to a more invasive phenotype and metastatic potential in human breast cancer through regulation of the levels of Upar, Est-1, MMP-9, RhoC and TIMP-2 expression (Chang et al., 2007). PRDX6 phosphorylation and subsequent phospholipase A2 activity are required for agonist-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase in mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelium and alveolar macrophages (Chatterjee et al., 2011). These studies, as well as our own, suggest that PRDX6 promotes lung tumor development via JAK2/STAT3 pathway, its GPx and iPLA2 activities, and is involved in drug resistance of several cancer types, suggesting that PRDX6 can be a therapeutic target for cancer treatment",

During redox signaling, some PRDXs have been implicated in the regulation of NF-\u03baB through the initial activation in the cytoplasm by controlling the components affecting I\u03baB phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation. In principle, PRDXs could have a different function in the nucleus because NF-\u03baB interactions with DNA are governed by a redox-sensitive cysteine (Cys62) on the p50 subunit of the NF-\u03baB dimer. Oxidation of Cys62 inhibits NF-\u03baB binding and decreases the effectiveness of NF-\u03baB signaling. Also, some PRDXs have also been implicated in the regulation of MAPK pathway during redox signaling. Although inhibiting PRDX appears to have different effects on MAPK activation depending on the cell or stimuli, in some cases the use of different stimuli, or time-points at which MAPK activation is assessed, make comparisons between studies difficult. In any case, the consequence of inhibiting PRDX in any given cell is likely to be determined by the levels of intracellular ROS and intrinsic features of the cell/compartment, such as the capacity to regenerate reduced PRDX, using Srx, or Trx using TrxR and NADPH. Besides these pathways, PRDXs also are involved in several cancer related pathways. Fig. 4\nillustrates the roles of PRDXs in the signaling pathways for the development of cancers.",

Furthermore, stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 protein, caused either by VHL deficiency under normoxia, or by hypoxia, significantly reduced PRDX3 expression. Luciferase-reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that HIF-1\u03b1 binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements of PRDX3 promoter and represses its transcription. Finally, shRNA-based assays suggested that PRDX3 downregulation is required for the HIF-1\u03b1-dependent proliferation of CCRCC cells (Xi et al., 2014). Ovarian cancer cells transfected with PRDX3/small interfering (Si)\u20111 efficiently downregulated the expression of PRDX3 and thus decreased the growth of the ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the silencing of PRDX3 triggered cisplatin\u2011mediated apoptosis in the ovarian cancer cells, which may act through suppression of the NF\u2011\u03baB signaling pathway (Song et al., 2011). In antiandrogen-resistant LNCaP cell lines, PRDX3 is upregulated and the resistant cells also possess an upregulation of the TCA pathway and resistance to H\u2082O\u2082-induced apoptosis through a failure to activate pro-apoptotic pathways. Also, knockdown of PRDX3 restored H\u2082O\u2082 sensitivity, and PRDX3 has been identified as a gene induced by oncogenic c-Myc (Whitaker et al., 2013). Its specific localization to mitochondria suggests that PRDX3, together with its mitochondrion-specific electron suppliers Trx2 and Trx reductase (TrxR) 2, might provide a primary line of defense against H2O2 produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, as SOD2 does against the superoxide radical. In addition, Srx plays a crucial role by reducing hyperoxidized PRDX3 via translocation into mitochondria. Noh et al. reported that the overexpression of mitochondrion-targeted Srx efficiently promotes the restoration of PRDX3 and results in cellular resistance to apoptosis, with enhanced elimination of mitochondrial H2O2 and decreased rates of \u0394\u03a8m collapse (Noh, Baek, Jeong, Rhee, & Chang, 2009). Thus, a Trx-related antioxidant system composed of Trx2, TrxR2, and PRDX3 has been closely associated with the regulation of apoptosis and the redox control of MPT pores for the release of cytochrome c (Noh et al., 2009).",

Pak et al showed that cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells cytotoxicity was associated with increased accumulation of intracellular (ROS) and apoptosis mediated by proteolytically activated caspase 3 and 9. Moreover, overexpression of PRDX 6 protein or exposure to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the apoptotic effect of cisplatin by reducing ROS levels and suppressing the caspase signaling pathway. In contrast, reduction of PRDX6 expression increased peroxide-induced cell death in liver cancer cells (Walsh et al., 2009). They showed that the cancerous hepatoma cell line is significantly more resistant to peroxide-induced cytotoxicity than the non-cancerous cell line, and hepatoma cell line expresses approximately 3-fold PRDX6 than non-cancerous cell line. Also, they showed that transient transfection of cancerous hepatoma cell line with PRDX6 siRNA led to an increase in peroxide-induced cytotoxicity by apoptosis. The invasion-promoting action of PRDX6 has also been confirmed using lung cancer cells, in which upregulation of PRDX6 results in the activation of Akt via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and p38 kinase, which promotes cell invasion by inducing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (Ho et al., 2010; Seung et al., 2009). Our study demonstrated that PRDX6 promoted lung tumor growth in an in vivo allograft model. Histopathological and Western blotting examination demonstrated that expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, VEGF, MMP-2 and -9, and cyclin-dependent kinases accompanied by increased iPLA2 and GPx activities were increased in the tumor tissues of PRDX6-overexpressing nude mice (Jo et al., 2013). In tumor tissues of PRDX6-overexpressing mice, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and AP-1 DNA binding were also increased (Yun et al., 2014a, Yun et al., 2014b). And the growth of lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI-H460) was enhanced by the increase in iPLA2 and GPx activities of PRDX6. In addition, mutant PRDX6 (C47S) attenuated PRDX6-mediated p38, ERK1/2, and AP-1 activities as well as its enzyme activities in the A549 and NCI-H460 lines. Furthermore, tumor growth and p38, ERK1/2, and AP-1 activities were also inhibited in nude mice bearing mutant PRDX6 (C47S) compared to PRDX6. Previously, we showed that urethane (1g/kg)-induced tumor incidence in PRDX6-Tg mice was significantly higher compared to non-Tg mice (Yun et al., 2015a, Yun et al., 2015b, Yun et al., 2015c). In the tumors of PRDX6-Tg mice, the activation of JAK2/STAT3 and STAT3 DNA binding were also increased, accompanied by increased GPx and iPLA2 activities. PRDX6 was colocalized with JAK2 in tumor tissues and lung cancer cells and also showed physical interaction with JAK2, and increased levels of PRDX6 increase the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, PRDX6-Tg mice showed altered cytokine levels in the tumors, especially leading to increased CCL5 levels. We validated that the activation of JAK2 was also decreased in lung tumors of CCR5-/- mice, and CCL5 increased the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in the lung cancer cells, suggesting that PRDX6 promotes lung tumor development via its mediated and CCL5-associated activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.",

            "text": "The neuroprotective role of PRDX2 is well established in AD and PD. Among the antioxidant PRDX enzymes, PRDX2 is the most abundant in mammalian neurons, making it a prime candidate to defend against oxidative stress (Fang, Nakamura, Cho, Gu, & Lipton, 2007). PRDX2 is overexpressed in the brain of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) indicating that PRDX2 protects the brain from A\u03b21-42 induced neurotoxicity (Yao et al., 2007). Another study also suggested that PRDX2 exhibited anti apoptotic effects in DA neurons via suppression of ASK1 dependent activation of JNK and p38 pathways which are activated in PA neurons of PD brains (Hu et al., 2011). The neurodegenerative role of PRDX2 is also established in AD and PD. The role of PRDX2 in PD is controversial. Garcia-Garcia et al suggested that the oxidative modification of PRDX2 is associated with drug induced apoptosis signaling in the model of Parkinson disease (Garcia-Garcia, Zavala-Flores, Rodriguez-Rocha, & Franco, 2012). They suggested that the oxidative modification of PRDX2 is involved in the regulation of 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic signaling in DA induced neuronal cell death. Qu et al defined the role of PRDX2 in PD and suggested that phosphorylation of PRDX2 isoform is involved in PD (Qu et al., 2007). In a histochemical study of brains from AD patients, nitrated PRDX2 was identified. Randall et al. investigated the functional consequences of PRDX2 tyrosine nitration, and demonstrated that nitration was on a non-catalytic residue that resulted in increases in peroxidase activity and resistance to over-oxidation (Randall et al., 2014). Fang et al observed increased S-nitrosylation of PRDX2 in human Parkinson's disease (PD) brains, and S-nitrosylation of PRDX2 inhibited both its enzymatic activity and protective function from oxidative stress (Fang et al., 2007). Dopaminergic neurons, which are lost in PD, become particularly vulnerable, provided a direct link between nitrosative/oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disorders such as PD (Fang et al., 2007). These data suggest that not only is PRDX2 involved in neuroprotection via inhibition of A\u03b21-42 induced apoptosis and suppression of JNK and p38 pathways, but also involved in neurodegeneration via oxidative modification, phosphorylation and s-nitrosylation of PRDX2.",

Hattori et al showed that PRDX3 is up-regulated in the mitochondria of damaged nerve cells (Hattori, Murayama, Noshita, & Oikawa, 2003). Because mitochondria is involved in excitotoxic damage of nerve cells, mitochondrial PRDX3 seems to be neuroprotective against oxidative insults (Hattori et al., 2003). Also, PRDX3 is decreased in the frontal cortex of patients with Down syndrome (P < 0.01) and Pick\u2019s disease (P < 0.001) (Krapfenbauer, Engidawork, Cairns, Fountoulakis, & Lubec, 2003).

A recent study also suggested that the autosomal dominant mutation of LRRK2 that is important for PD, increased the phosphorylation of PRDX3 and resulted in the oxidative stress induced neuronal death (Angeles et al., 2011). These data indicate that PRDX3 is involved in the neuroprotection against oxidative insults in the mitochondria, and involved in neurodegeneration through increased phosphorylation by LRRK2 mutation.",

In the recent study, we also showed that the expression of an PRDX6 is markedly increased in spinal cords of mice with EAE compared to other PRDXs. PRDX6 transgenic mice displayed a significant decrease in clinical severity and attenuated demyelination in EAE compared to wild type mice, suggesting that PRDX6 expression may represent a therapeutic way to restrict inflammation in the central nervous system and potentiate oligodendrocyte survival, and suggest a new molecule for neuroprotective therapies in MS (Yun et al., 2015a, Yun et al., 2015b, Yun et al., 2015c). The neurodegenerative role of PRDX6 is established in AD and PD. Our recent study suggested that overexpression of PRDX6 could accelerate the development of AD through increased amyloidogenesis through independent PLA2 activation and Nrf2 transcription (Yun et al., 2013). In a mouse model after amyloid beta infusion, memory impairment in PRDX6 transgenic mice was worse than C57BL/6 mice. In addition, the astrocytes and microglia cells of amyloid-infused PRDX6 transgenic mice were more activated, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl levels were increased and glutathione levels were lower, suggesting that PRDX6 is promoting rather than preventing oxidative stress (Yun et al., 2013). Our recent study also suggested that PRDX6 exacerbates dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a MPTP mouse model of PD (Yun et al., 2015a, Yun et al., 2015b, Yun et al., 2015c). These data indicate that PRDX6 induces neurodegeneration through iPLA2 and nrf2 activation in AD, and induction of MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD, but inhibits multiple sclerosis by suppressing inflammation and blood brain barrier disruption in EAE model.",

They also demonstrated that PRDX2 is a bona fide substrate for the cdk5-p35 complex, which phosphorylated PRDX2 at the threonine residue at position 89. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5, a serine/threonine kinase, contributes to neurodegeneration in PD. This kinase is shown to phosphorylate PRDX2, inactivating it, and thereby sensitizing neurons to the deleterious effects of parkinsonian toxins. Hu et al. explored the role of PRDX2 and showed it inhibited 6 hydroxydopamine-induced ASK1 activation by modulating the redox state of Trx1 preventing its dissociation from ASK1 (Hu et al., 2011). They showed that Lentivirus-mediated PRDX2 overexpression conferred marked in vitro and in vivo neuroprotection against 6-OHDA toxicity in DA neurons, and preserved motor functions involving the dopamine system in mouse. In addition to its role as an antioxidant enzyme, PRDX2 exhibited anti-apoptotic effects in DA neurons via suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1)-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun and p38 pro-death pathways, which are also activated in DA neurons of postmortem PD brains. PRDX2 inhibited 6-OHDA-induced ASK1 activation by modulating the redox status of the endogenous ASK1 inhibitor Trx. PRDX2 overexpression maintained Trx in a reduced state by inhibiting the cysteine thiol-disulphide exchange, thereby preventing its dissociation from ASK1.",

            "text": "Kim et al suggested that apoptosis was inhibited after amyloid beta treatment in PC12 cells overexpressing wild-type PRDX6, but not in cells that overexpressed the C47S catalytic mutant. This indicates that the peroxidase activity of PRDX6 protects PC12 cells from amyloid-induced neurotoxicity (Kim et al., 2013a, b). Our recent study also demonstrated that A\u03b21-42-induced memory impairment in PRDX6 transgenic mice was worse than C57BL/6 mice, and the expression of amyloid precursor protein cleavage, C99, \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 was greatly increased (Yun et al., 2013). In addition, the astrocytes and microglia cells of A\u03b2-infused PRDX6 transgenic mice were more activated, and A\u03b2 also significantly increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl levels, but decreased glutathione levels. Furthermore, we found that translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus was increased in A\u03b2-infused PRDX6 transgenic mice. These results suggest that the overexpression of PRDX6 could accelerate the development of AD through increased amyloidogenesis through independent PLA2 activation and Nrf2 transcription. We also recently investigated the effects of PRDX6 on MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration using PRDX6 Tg mice (Yun et al., 2015a, Yun et al., 2015b, Yun et al., 2015c). PRDX6 Tg mice had a much higher loss of dopaminergic neurons by MPTP administration compared to non-Tg mice. There was also a much higher behavioral impairment and astrocyte activation in PRDX6 Tg mice. MPTP-induced GPx activity was not different between PRDX6 Tg mice and non-Tg mice, which is accompanied by hyperoxidation of PRDX6. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of PRDX6 showed similar distribution and co-localization with astrocytes, but not neurons in the mouse and human brain. Furthermore, we demonstrated that iPLA2 activity of PRDX6 induced astrocytic activation followed by increased proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- \u03b1 and IL1-\u03b2), 4-HNE, and PRDX6 hyperoxidation in primary cultured astrocytes. A recent study suggested the translational potential of blocking TLR4/PRDX6 signaling for the treatment of ischemic stroke (Kuang et al., 2014). They showed that ligustilide (LIG) exerted antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects against an ischemic insult, and showed that TLR4/PRDX6 pathway is involved in the protective effect of LIG against postischemic neuroinflammation and brain injury induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Also, LIG-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by the improvement of neuropathological alterations, including neuron loss, astrocyte and microglia/macrophage activation, neutrophil and T-lymphocyte invasion, and regulation of inflammatory mediator expression. Moreover, LIG significantly inhibited the expression and extracellular release of PRDX6 and activation of TLR4 signaling, reflected by decreased TLR4 expression, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in the ischemic brain.",

            "text": "The beneficial role of PRDX1 in inflammatory diseases is well established. In addition, PRDX1 deficiency enhanced the regulated secretion pathway in endothelial cells by the promotion of excessive release of several proinflammatory components. Kisucka et al examined the role of PRDX1 in the apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) murine spontaneous model of atherosclerosis (Kisucka et al., 2008). They showed that PRDX1-/-/apoE-/- mice fed normal chow developed larger, more macrophage-rich aortic sinus lesions than PRDX1+/+/apoE-/- mice, despite similar amounts and size distributions of cholesterol in their plasma lipoproteins, suggesting that PRDX1 protects against excessive endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. The role of PRDX1 as non-beneficial in inflammatory diseases is also established. PRDX1 is induced by exposing macrophages to oxidized LDL5 and by laminar shear stress in endothelial cells (Conway and Kinter, 2006, Mowbray et al., 2008). Also, transcription factor Nrf2, one of the erythroid transcription factor NFE2 subunit factors responsible for the induction of defense proteins including PRDX1, is activated in oxidized LDL-treated macrophage cells, thus these data suggested that PRDX1 is involved in macrophage activation (Kisucka et al., 2008). In the RA patient tissue, the PRDX1 is overexpressed by more than 3 fold compared with normal tissues (Li et al., 2013). Demasi et al suggested that PRDX1 induction could be considered a crucial part of the cellular adaptive response to the B-cell differentiation process to cope with the additional H2O2 associated with massive disulphide bond formation during immunoglobulin folding in the ER of plasma cells (Demasi et al., 2007). These data indicate that PRDX1 inhibits inflammatory disease by protection of excessive endothelial activation and atherosclerosis, but induces inflammatory disease via activation of Nrf2.",

            "text": "The beneficial role of PRDX2 in inflammatory diseases is well established. PRDX2, a thiol-specific peroxidase, has been reported to regulate proinflammatory responses, vascular remodeling, and global oxidative stress (Park et al., 2011). PRDX2 removes transiently produced H2O2 in response to activation of various cell surface receptors. PRDX2 regulates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling, including enhanced activation of the PDGF receptor and phospholipase C\u03b31, and vascular remodeling, including PDGF-dependent neointimal thickening of vascular smooth muscle cells (Choi et al., 2005). Yang et al showed that PRDX2 inhibits general immune cell responsiveness by scavenging low levels of ROS, modulating LPS-induced proinflammatory responses, and protecting against endotoxin-induced lethal shock (Yang et al., 2007). A recent report showed that PRDX2 is more susceptible than PRDX1 to hyperoxidation in cells subjected to sustained global oxidative stress, which suggests that PRDX2 deficiency may lead to accelerated atherosclerosis due to failure to eliminate ROS (Woo et al., 2010). It has recently been shown that PRDX2 suppresses the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) through the site-selective phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor and, furthermore, is involved in the neointimal thickening of SMCs in balloon-injured carotidartery (Kang et al., 2013). The role of PRDX2 in inflammatory diseases as non-beneficial in inflammatory diseases is also established. In a recent study by Bayer et al, PRDX2 is increased in the presence of the neutrophils and under acidotic conditions and also oxidation of erythrocyte PRDX2 is increased in a mouse model of endotoxemia (Bayer, Maghzal, Stocker, Hampton, & Winterbourn, 2013). Another recent study also showed that the level of intracellular PRDX2 protein content of lymphocytes from RA patients was more than 2-fold higher compared with healthy lymphocytes suggesting that PRDX2 is involved in the persistence of pro-inflammatory cells in chronic inflammation (Szab\u00f3-Taylor et al., 2012). Also, PRDX2 is readily detected in the blood of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients, whereas it is undetectable in normal control blood (Chen et al., 2004). Recombinant PRDX2 induces macrophages to produce TNF-\u03b1 in the absence of any other stimuli, demonstrating that the Trx peroxidase PRDX2 is appropriately classified as a danger signal, meaning a molecule that is released by cells undergoing stress and acts as an immune mediator (Salzano et al., 2014). These data suggest that PRDX2 suppresses inflammatory diseases through inhibition of PDGF signaling, inhibition of immune cell responsiveness and elimination of ROS, but induces inflammatory diseases through persistence of pro-inflammatory cells and mediation of TNF-\u03b1 production.",

            "text": "Riddell et al. found that extracellular PRDX1 can induce activation of NF-\u03baB through TLR4 (Riddell et al., 2012). They showed that incubation of mouse vascular endothelial cells with recombinant PRDX1 caused an increase of VEGF expression that was dependent upon TLR4 and required hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) interaction with the VEGF promoter. The induction of VEGF was also dependent upon NF-\u03baB; however, NF-\u03baB interaction with the VEGF promoter was not required for PRDX1 induction of VEGF suggesting that NF-\u03baB was acting indirectly to induce VEGF expression. Riddell et al. also showed that recombinant PRDX1 supplemented to the culture medium induced secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 from mouse thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (Riddell et al., 2010). They showed that secretion of cytokines in response to PRDX1 was dependent upon serum and required CD14 and MD2. Binding of PRDX1 to TG-macrophages occurred within minutes and resulted in TLR4 endocytosis. PRDX1 interaction with TLR4 was independent of its peroxidase activity and appeared to be dependent upon its chaperone activity and ability to form decamers. Cytokine expression occurred via the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway, which resulted in nuclear translocation and activation of NF-\u03baB. These findings suggest that PRDX1 may act as a danger signal similar to other TLR4 binding chaperone molecules such as HSP72. Shichita et al. showed that PRDX1 to 6 all bind to TLR4 and induce IL-23 (Shichita et al., 2012a, Shichita et al., 2012b). The authors identified PRDXs as key initiators of post-ischemic inflammation in the brain. They showed that IL-23 production from infiltrated macrophages induces IL-17-producing T cells, which play a role in the promotion of delayed ischemic brain damages. It was speculated that PRDXs released from necrotic cells induce NF-\u03baB activation and the production of IL-23 (Salzano et al., 2014). The authors identified a domain on PRDXs required for the TLR4-mediated cytokine production. This domain is amino acid residues between 70 and 90 of PRDX5 and homologous regions in other PRDXs that commonly contain \u03b24 sheet and \u03b13 helix regions. It is noted, however, that the activity of domain containing GST-PRDX fusion proteins induced the IL-23 mRNA to a much lesser extent compared to whole PRDXs. The interaction of PRDXs with TLR4 should be strictly regulated by a manner different from that of LPS. Kisucka et al examined the role of PRDX1 in the apoE-/- murine spontaneous model of atherosclerosis (Kisucka et al., 2008). They showed that PRDX1-/-/apoE-/- mice fed normal chow developed larger, more macrophage-rich aortic sinus lesions than PRDX1+/+/apoE-/- mice, despite similar amounts and size distributions of cholesterol in their plasma lipoproteins, suggesting that PRDX1 protects against excessive endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. PRDX1 deficiency enhanced the regulated secretion pathway in endothelial cells by promotion of excessive release of several proinflammatory components of Weibel-Palade bodies, such as P-selectin and von Willebrand factor (Kisucka et al., 2008). However, PRDX1 deficiency did not affect transcriptional regulation of receptors such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).",

            "text": "One study showed that PRDX2 is highly expressed in endothelial and immune cells in atherosclerotic lesions and blocked the increase of endogenous H2O2 by atherogenic stimulation (Park et al., 2011). Deficiency of PRDX2 in apoE-/- mice accelerated plaque formation with enhanced activation of p65, c-Jun, JNKs, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; and these proatherogenic effects of PRDX2 deficiency were rescued by the administration of the antioxidant ebselen. Also, they showed that PRDX2 deficiency resulted in increased expression of vascular adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, which led to increased immune cell adhesion and infiltration into the aortic intima. Moreover, compared with deficiency of glutathione peroxidase 1 or catalase, PRDX2 deficiency showed a severe predisposition to develop atherosclerosis. Chen et al showed that inflammatory stimuli induce the release of oxidized PRDX2, a ubiquitous redox-active intracellular enzyme (Chen et al., 2004). Once released, the extracellular PRDX2 acts as a redox-dependent inflammatory mediator, triggering macrophages to produce and release TNF-\u03b1. The oxidative coupling of glutathione (GSH) to PRDX2 cysteine residues occurs before or during PRDX2 release, a process central to the regulation of immunity (Salzano et al., 2014). Salzano et al identified PRDX2 among the glutathionylated proteins released in vitro by LPS-stimulated macrophages using mass spectrometry proteomic methods. Consistent with being part of an inflammatory cascade, it was found that PRDX2 then induces TNF-\u03b1 release (Salzano et al., 2014). Importantly, the PRDX2 substrate TRX is also released along with PRDX2, enabling an oxidative cascade that can alter the \u2013SH status of surface proteins and thereby facilitate activation via cytokine and Toll-like receptors (Salzano et al., 2014).",

By virtue of its antioxidant activity, the extracellular PRDX4 can protect the vascular tissue against ROS and hence, it has ability to inhibit the oxidative stress induced inflammation in various tissues and it can also reduce the chances of oxidative stress induced diabetes mellitus in animal models (Ding et al., 2010). Yamada et al demonstrated that streptozotocin-treated Tg mice, which overexpress hPRDX4 in pancreatic islets, can protect pancreatic beta-cells against streptozotocin-induced injury (insulitis) by suppressing increased oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling activation (Yamada, Ding, & Sasaguri, 2012). These observations indicate that Tg mice could become a useful animal model to study the relevance of oxidative stress to inflammation, and that a specific accelerator of PRDX4 might prove to be a potential therapeutic agent for ameliorating various chronic inflammatory diseases. It was also reported that HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance were prevented in PRDX4 transgenic mice by amelioration of oxidative stress (Ding et al., 2010). They showed that PRDX4 protects against the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and insulin resistance, particularly in the liver, in a nongenetic mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease /or type 2 diabetes mellitus. These effects of PRDX4 were achieved by reducing oxidative stress and ameliorating hepatic steatosis, inflammatory reaction, apoptotic activity, and fibrogenesis at systemic as well as local levels.",

He et al showed that PRDX1 knockdown enhances sensitization to \u03b2-lap that is an anticancer agent through modulating ROS accumulation and MAPK activation (He et al., 2013). Also, downregulation of PRDX1 by a novel fully human phage display recombinant antibody induces apoptosis and enhances radiation sensitization in lung carcinoma cells (Guo et al., 2011), indicating that PRDX1 could be targets competing against cancer. The therapeutic agents targeting PRDX1 are studied for treatment of cancer. A recent study demonstrated that theonellasterone, a steroidal metabolite isolated from a Theonellasponge targets the PRDX1 and protects its cysteine over-oxidation induced by H2O2 both in vitro and in vivo. This suggested that THS can be used as an anticancer agent for several cancers (Margarucci et al., 2015). Liu et al also demonstrated that adenanthin, a diterpenoid isolated from the leaves of Rabdosia adenantha inhibits the tumor growth in the mouse acute promyelocytic leukemia mouse model by directly targeting the conserved resolving cysteines of PRDX1 as well as PRDX2 and inhibits their peroxidase activities (Liu et al., 2012). Hou et al also investigated the effect of adenanthin on HCC cells, and found that the natural agent can kill malignant liver cells in vitro and xenografts through targeting PRDX1 and PRDX2, thus increasing ROS level (Hou et al., 2014).",

Reduced Trx catalyzes the reduction of disulphides (s-s) within oxidized PRDXs. The oxidized form of PRDXs can then be recycled back to its reduced form by Trx. Further thiol oxidation of PRDXs by higher levels of H2O2 radically inactivates the target proteins allowing H2O2 levels to increase in the cell and to trigger the H2O2-dependent signaling.

Recombinant PRDX1 supplemented to the culture medium induced secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 from mouse thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages and BMDM. This effect of PRDX1 is quite similar to that of LPS as it required membrane proteins CD14 and MD2 and was mediated by the TLR4-MyD88 signaling leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB. It was speculated that PRDXs released from necrotic cells induce NF-\u03baB activation and the production of IL-23. PRDX2 is a negative regulator of PDGF signalling. PRDX2 suppresses activation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) and phospholipase C\u03b31, and subsequently decreases cell proliferation and migration in response to PDGF. Also, PRDX2 is recruited to PDGFR upon PDGF stimulation, and suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase inactivation.
