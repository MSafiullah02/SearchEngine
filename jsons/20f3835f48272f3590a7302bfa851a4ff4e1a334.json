            "text": "Apoptosis is a selective process for cell deletion and can be induced by a variety of physiological and non-physiological stimuli, including viral infections. 1 A growing number of viruses have been shown to actively promote apoptosis, representing a culmination of a lytic infection that serves to spread virus progeny to neighboring cells while evading host inflammatory responses. 2 Various groups of molecules are involved in the apoptotic pathway. One set of mediators implicated in apoptosis belongs to the cysteine dependent aspartate-specific family of proteases referred to as caspases. Caspase-3 has been identified as the key pro-apoptotic protease in neuronal apoptosis. 3 HCoV-OC43 causes acute encephalitis in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice. Following intracerebral (IC) inoculation, mice developed disseminated infection and mortality seemed to be related to the amount of infectious virus in the CNS. 4 Using a mouse primary cortical cell cultures, we showed that these cultures were productively infected by HCoV-OC43 and that neurons underwent nuclear fragmentation associated with activated caspase-3 positive staining, indicating that HCoV-OC43 infection induced neuronal apoptosis. We also demonstrated apoptosis of neurons takes place during encephalitis in the CNS of infected mice. These findings illustrate that HCoV-OC43 is responsible for neuronal cell death and suggest that apoptosis could play a role in the dissemination of HCoV-OC43.",

HCoV-OC43-induced apoptosis in primary mouse cell cultures. Cortical cells were infected by HCoV-OC43 at an MOI of 1. Twenty-four hpi, cells cultures were stained for viral antigens (A) and activated caspase-3 (B). In panel C and at higher magnification in panel D, activated caspase-3 positive cells staining were colocalized with the nuclear fragmentation observed with DAPI staining (arrows). All photographs were taken on the same cell culture field at a magnification of x200 for panels A, B, C and x400 for panel D. We have previously demonstrated the neuroinvasive properties of HCoV-OC43 in mice and that the severity of disease seemed to be linked to the amount of infectious virus in the CNS, 4 illustrating that virus replication played a major role in the development of the pathology. Some viruses appear to use apoptosis as a mechanism for killing cells and spreading. This represents an important mechanism for efficient dissemination of progeny virions, as well as a means by which viruses can induce host cell death, while limiting inflammatory and other immune responses. 2 Here we report that HCoV-OC43 induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro, as well as in vivo, which could account for part of the neuronal cell death observed after infection. These results illustrate one of the possible mechanisms used by HCoV-OC43 to spread to the whole CNS, which was responsible for the development of an acute encephalitis in infected mice.",
