The Spike protein is the major antigenic protein and is under selection pressure by the host immune response; it is important for host range and tissue tropism. It is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits for receptor binding and membrane fusion. The N\u2010terminal domain of the S1 subunit is responsible for sugar receptor binding and the S2 subunit is responsible for fusion of viral and host membranes.6 The S1 subunit is more divergent in sequence and the S2 subunit is more conserved.1, 2, 3, 7\n",

            "text": "Through Illumina sequencing, we have introduced high\u2010resolution HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene mutational load to quantify viral quasi\u2010species population diversity. The experimental method allows the role of HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene heterogeneity to be investigated in a manner not previously reported. The HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene does have quasi\u2010species, but the magnitude is almost 10 times lower than the quasi\u2010species found in HCV, while the nonsynonymous mutations take a higher percentage of the total mutation load for HCoV\u2010OC43 than HCV genotype 1a. It should be noted that the Spike gene was amplified with the gene\u2010specific primers. Although these primers are located in the conserved HCoV HE and NS2 domains, the missing of potentially heterogeneous viral variants during the amplification cannot be excluded. As a consequence, quasi\u2010species diversity of HCoV may be underestimated in the current study in comparison to the use of degenerate primers or primer\u2010independent approaches. Viral replicative dynamics, population size, and host immune responses may contribute to this observation, and the finding has implications in terms of HCoV evolution and treatment. High mutation load facilitates the evolution of viral populations in response to external pressure. Given their slightly deleterious nature;27 however, excessive nonsynonymous mutations can be detrimental to such adaptive evolution.28 Consequently, accumulation of deleterious mutation load during viral infection may contribute to self\u2010limited active infection. In the case of HCoV\u2010OC43, this could contribute to short, self\u2010limited respiratory tract infections compared to HCV, which is a chronic, systemic viral infection with ongoing viral replication. However, genetic diversity manifested by a cloud of quasi\u2010species in some viral systems can be linked to pathogenicity and shown to allow adaptation to new environments such as infection of new hosts.29 If clonal virus populations are present in human infections with MERS\u2010CoV,30, 31 this could increase the chances of epidemic spread of a particularly virulent strain.32 Infections with a cloud of viral strains may enhance spread, for instance, by increasing the chance of a virulent strain being transmitted, or reduce it due to defective and less virulent strains being present. MERS\u2010CoV genome sequences from dromedary camels indicate presence of quasi\u2010species in single samples.30 Recent deep sequencing analyses reported intra\u2010patient viral heterogeneity during a 2015 outbreak of MERS\u2010CoV and the possibility that host immune response provided selection pressure to favor genetic heterogeneity.33, 34 Intra\u2010patient viral heterogeneity may have contributed to transmissibility.33\n",

These areas are important for binding affinity to human angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme two for SARS\u2010CoV, and host immune responses.38 Our isolates had nonsynonymous substitutions at amino acid residues 259 and 260\u2010264 in the N\u2010terminal domain of S1, and, in particular, had nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions within the region between amino acids 471 and 550 at a putative receptor binding domain of HCoV\u2010OC43 (a.a. positions 339\u2010549).4 In other HCoV strains, for instance HCoV\u2010229E, antibody neutralization of the virus is dependent on the antigenic phenotype of the S1 subunit region.39 Hence, this may also be a factor for HCoV\u2010OC43 needing further study.
