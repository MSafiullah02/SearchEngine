            "text": "The life cycle of Vairirnorpha necatrix was studied by electron microscopy. Disporous development has two distinct stages: 1) diplokaryotic meronts which are actively mitotic, and 2) diplokaryotic sporonts which are distinguished by reduced ribosome density and a thickened plasmalemma. After final division of the sporont, sporoblasts form spores which are ovocylindrical and measure 4.4 * 0.08 x 2.3 * 0.05 pm (mean f SE). Octosporous development results in eight haploid spores being formed in a sporophorous vesicle. The uninucleate octospores were smaller than the binucleate dispores and the exospore was thicker but less crenulate in outline. Early in octosporogony, tubules are produced from the sporont plasmalemma and electron-dense material accumulates in the episporontal space. The latter may be amorphous, vesiculated, or vacuolated in appearance and in later stages may take a stacked, lamellar form. At sporoblast formation, exospore material coats the plasmalemma and attached tubules; all inclusions in the episporontal space gradually disappear as spores are formed. These secretory products may have application to taxonomic distinction at the species level.",

Early octosporonts were similar in appearance to the diplokaryotic sporonts where the cytoplasm was less dense and cisternae of RER became more abundant (Fig. 7) . The principal distinction was the formation of a membrane-like structure exterior to the plasmalemma that became the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle (SV). The envelope appeared as blebs at various places on the plasmalemma and electron-dense material was secreted into the episporontal space (ES) between the envelope and the sporont plasmalemma (Fig. 7) . As shown when examined in a favorable plane of section (Fig. 8, 9 ), these early octosporonts were binucleate. Separation of the two nuclei of the diplokaryon prior to meiosis is apparent in Fig. 8 and 9 , but synaptonemal complexes indicating meiotic activity were not observed. Following this stage, nuclear division and cytokinesis gave rise to tetraand octonucleate sporonts. Spindle plaques with microtubules radiating toward electron-dense chromatin masses, probably synapsed chromosomes, were observed in dividing nuclei (Fig. The cytoplasm of the early stage sporonts was observed containing material in vacuoles similar to the electron-dense material secreted into the ES (Fig. 9, I I) . This secretory material 10). ranged from being uniformly electron dense to more-or-less vacuolated in appearance (Fig. 8-11 ). In some sporonts the electron-dense material appeared to organize into lamellar structures (Fig. 12, 13 ) 21 to 34 nm (27 k 0.01) thick. In more advanced stages of octosporogony (Fig. 14) , the lamellae either disappeared or reorganized into the electron-dense amorphous masses of secretory material. Alternatively, this material may not always organize into lamellae and may persist in the ES during sporoblast formation. Tubular structures, 2 3 4 9 nm (36 f 0.8) in diameter, also occurred in the ES primarily in the space between the sporont and the secretory material ( Fig. 10-12) ; in some sections, they appeared to have been produced from or attached to the sporont plasmalemma (Fig. 15 ). The faintly staining tubules were usually closely associated with the secretory material but separate groups of tubules often occurred apart from this material. The tubules also occurred in sporonts exhibiting the stacked lamellae and usually persisted in the ES during sporoblast formation (Fig.  13) . Sporoblast development was marked by an increasingly electron-dense and thickened layer of exospore material on the sporont plasmalemma (Fig. 13-1 6) . As the exospore was deposited on the surface of the plasmalemma, it also coated the basal regions of the tubules still attached to the sporont plasmalemma (Fig. 16) . Tubules and secretory material gradually disappeared with sporoblast formation and spore maturation (Fig. 17, 18 ).",

Working with a Glugea sp., Takvorian and Cali [ 151 identified three types of tubular appendages continuous with the sporont's plasmalemma. Larsson [9] has reviewed other types of inclusions described in the ES of other species. In V. necatrix, Type I1 tubules of Takvorian and Cali's classification were observed. These clearly emanate from the plasmalemma of the sporont (Fig. 15 ) and are most abundant in early stages of octosporogony ( Fig. 9-13 ). Malone and Canning [ 121 described these as being parallel to the plasmalemma. In our study, tubules were most frequently seen in close association with the plasmalemma but not necessarily parallel. Frequently the tubules extended further into the ES with little apparent organization. Although these tubules have mostly disappeared in late octosporogonic stages, tubules still attached to the sporont plasmalemma when exospore material is deposited externally on developing sporoblasts are also coated basally (Fig. 16) .",

We feel that these may be useful in taxonomy, especially at the species level. For example, they are the one morphological difference which can be used to distinguish between V. necatrix and V. plodiae. species which are otherwise difficult to separate by ultrastructure. The SV inclusions, which are amorphous, and the tubules appear identical in each of these species, although the tubules of V. necatrix do not appear as tightly associated with the plasmalemma as do those of V. plodiae. However, the electron-dense lamellar structures are the most significantly different feature between these two species. In V. plodiae they make \"intricate layered configuration(s)\" which at the peak of development make fingerprint-like whorls in and around themselves. In V. necatrix, the lamellae are more parallel with a stacked membranous appearance (Fig. 13) . In Larsson's [9] work on ultrastructural cytology, they would require some expansion of the Type 5E in his description of inclusions in sporophorous vesicles.",

            "text": "The potential taxonomic value of inclusions in the ES is also shown when those occumng in V. necatrix are compared with those produced by V. ephestiae as described by Weiser and Pumni [ 181. In their study, the electron-dense secretory material also transforms into membranous layers similar in configuration to those of V. necatrix. The Type I1 tubules of Takvorian and Cali [I51 also are present with both inclusions disappearing during late stages of octosporogony. However, in their study each lamella was identified as having a well-organized central core and two identical surface layers, details not ascertained in V. necatrix. While Weiser and Pumni [ 181 made no attempt to differentiate their species from any of the other described species of Vairimorpha, the only significant difference other than that noted above was in the number of coils of the polar filament, apparently 16, of the binucleate spore, although they cite 14 coils in the summary of their paper for both types of spores. They also described stages involved in both disporogony and octosporogony as developing within \"parasitophorous vacuoles\" of host cell origin; however, this observation needs reinterpretation, especially since their figure of a diplokaryotic sporont (Fig. 37 in [ 181) in a \"parasitophorous vesicle\" complete with tubules and masses of electron-dense secretory material is more likely an early stage in octosporogony prior to meiosis similar to the stage shown in Fig. 8 and 9 in V. necatrix. Thus, while the two species appear to be similar ultrastructurally, further study will be required to determine if V. ephestiae might be conspecific with V. necatrix.",
