Furthermore, bacterial colonization may contaminate and thus inhibit viral culture in sputum samples as well as RT-PCR, and RT-PCR assays using sputum face other technical limitations, such as lack of standardization and unknown reproducibility. In addition, potentially pathogenic viruses rarely found in lower airways, such as bocavirus or rhinovirus, would be overlooked if searched only in sputum. Many of these limitations can be overcome by nasopharyngeal sampling, which demands only very limited patient collaboration. Finally, the nasopharyngeal area is considered the most appropriate site for detecting viral replication, and lower respiratory tract replication in absence of URT infection is exceptional.28\n",

Indeed, detection of viral nucleic acids in upper-respiratory secretions is not proof per se of a causal relationship, but there is substantial evidence2 supporting the role of respiratory viruses in promoting inflammatory processes leading to exacerbation. It is also established that viruses, such as RSV, may directly infect the lower airway in patients with COPD.29 The causal relationship between a viral infection initiated in the upper-respiratory tract and exacerbation has been demonstrated in a small experimental study in which four patients with stable COPD were infected with rhinoviruses.30 Thus, viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swab of patients with AECOPD do play a role in the development of respiratory symptoms either alone or as cofactors with other pathogens or nonbiologic agents, such as air pollution or tobacco smoke.2 Importantly, the concordance between nasopharyngeal swabs and lower-respiratory tract sampling has been found to be high, particularly for respiratory viruses.31, 32 Additionally, viruses detected in URT have been suspected to be causal agents in community-acquired pneumonia.33\n",

The present study offered the advantage of an extensive molecular viral screening in a well-defined clinical entity (AECOPD) known to be associated with both bacterial and viral infections. Biologic markers, such as CRP, are elevated during COPD exacerbations,2, 36 but the association between viral infections and systemic inflammation biomarkers has been addressed only in a few studies until now.2, 12 We thus tested the performance of CRP and PCT for this indication. In AECOPD, PCT-based guidelines may lead to a decreased use of antibiotics.37 In practice, when PCT values are below a predefined limit, many clinicians consider that viruses, not bacteria, cause AECOPD. Our results did not show any correlation between either CRP or PCT values and sputum cultures or results of virological screening, and neither of these biomarkers could efficiently discriminate between these two types of infection. It is possible that a lack of power might explain these results, as our study was not properly powered to detect differences in PCT levels between groups. Furthermore, the fact that one-third of patients included was already on antibiotics at admission may have contributed to low PCT values; these results reflect, however, the real life of clinical practice, thus limiting the predictive value of PCT at hospital admission.",

It is quite possible that our study underestimated the rate of bacterial infection or coinfection in as much as sputum samples for bacterial analysis were available in only 45% of cases, and 57% of these patients had already received antibiotics. Conversely, our bacterial assays were only semiquantitative, and we did not perform bacterial detection at follow-up. Because bacterial colonization is common in patients with COPD, the possible identification of bacteria in AECOPD does not necessarily imply an etiologic role. This finding may have affected values of biomarkers and clinical outcome. Additionally, patients were not recruited at the very onset of AECOPD and may have passed the peak viral load, which could have underestimated the real prevalence of virus-related AECOPD. However, given the high sensitivity of RT-PCR and the fact that viral nucleic acid detection in URT is possible for as long as 8 to 11 days after AECOPD,30 we believe that the reported rate of viral infection is reliable. Finally, the lack of relation in our study between recovery time and detection of viruses also could be explained by the fact that patients were mainly referred by their physician and that it was difficult to determine precisely the exact start of the exacerbation because the thresholds for referral differ between physicians. This reflects the difficulties encountered in real-life management of patients with COPD.",
