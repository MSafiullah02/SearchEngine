In the security realm, the scope and pace of the advances potentially pose fundamental challenges to the national and international institutions and policies that have been developed to prevent the misuse of the life sciences to cause deliberate harm.",

Beyond governments, a wide and varied array of nongovernmental stakeholders are essential elements of a successful prevention strategy, including industry, the public health community, the law enforcement and security communities, and so on.

            "text": "Mobilizing the scientific community in support of biological nonproliferation and disarmament faces a number of challenges. One is the scope of research about which policy makers should be concerned. In 2003, a report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences coined the phrase \u201cdual use dilemma\u201d to describe the risk that research intended for benign purposes could also be misused to develop biological weapons or for bioterrorism (NRC, 2004).3\nThe members of the committee that produced the Fink report, named for the committee's chair, Gerald Fink of MIT, could not have anticipated that \u201cdual use research\u201d would become the standard term for a set of the security issues raised by modern biotechnology. But although in common use, it remains controversial. Critics argue in particular that the concept is too broad to be useful and could lead to policies that unnecessarily hamper important research. In 2007, when the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) proposed a framework for oversight of dual use research, the Board argued thatBecause arguably most life sciences research has some potential for dual use, the NSABB strove to delineate a threshold that would identify that subset of life sciences research with the highest potential for yielding knowledge, products, or technology that could be misapplied to threaten public health or other aspects of national security. This subset of research is referred to herein as \u201cdual use research of concern\u201d (NSABB, 2007: 16).\n",

Efforts to create a compelling frame that defines an issue in policy debates over emerging technologies are thus often a key feature of the strategies used by different groups. One can think of examples such as \u201cFrankenfoods\u201d in the battles over genetically modified organisms in agriculture or the current competing frames of \u201cautonomous weapons systems\u201d versus \u201ckiller robots.\u201d Studies of communication provide insights into how to design and convey information and messages to enhance the chances of understanding and acceptance by the recipients, including for emerging technologies (Nisbet & Lewenstein, 2002; Scheufele & Lewenstein, 2005). The understanding and application of insights about framing is central to the emerging \u201cscience of science communication\u201d (Jameison, Kahan, & Scheufele, 2017). The next section offers an example of how what I call \u201ccompeting catastrophes\u201d came to frame the controversy over research with pathogens with pandemic potential. This is followed by an example of how some international scientific organizations have framed scientists\u2019 engagement in biosecurity issues as part of the \u201cresponsible conduct of research\u201d or the larger \u201csocial responsibility of science.\u201d",

Influenza is widely considered to pose the greatest threat of a devastating global outbreak and the H5N1 strain is one of the flu strains considered to have pandemic potential. So the researchers set out to explore the conditions under which the virus might become transmissible among mammals.Using well-known techniques, the groups had selected for influenza strains highly transmissible between ferrets [the human model for influenza research], identified and sequenced the strains\u2019 genetic mutations, inserted the mutated genes into a new virus, and, by observing the behavior of the newly constructed viruses, demonstrated a causal link between the mutated genes and degree of transmissibility between mammals (NRC, 2013: 1).\n",

In January 2012, a group of influenza researchers announced a 2-month moratorium on H5N1 research that could produce new highly pathogenic, highly transmissible strains to allow time for an international debate on the issues (Enserink, 2012). In February the World Health Organization (WHO) brought together a small group of public health and influenza experts. WHO was a natural international convener because it oversees a global network of collaborating research centers on influenza as well as the international process to identify the candidates for annual flu vaccines. In addition, national limits on influenza research in the name of security could disrupt the painstakingly negotiated Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2011.13\nBut critics of the research argued that this also gave WHO a major stake in the outcome of the controversy, which raised questions about its capacity to be a neutral forum. The group's recommendation to publish the manuscripts in full once concerns about biosecurity and appropriate communication of the results were addressed confirmed the expectations of both advocates and critics.

In Europe, for example, the Fouchier case raised serious questions at the national and regional level about whether the European Union might decide that its measures against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) should apply to all member states and become engaged in more active oversight. The European scientific community expressed widely different views to the European Commission in the second half of 2013 about the relative risks and benefits of such research. The European Society for Virology wrote to the head of the European Commission (EC) in October to raise concerns about the damage to important research that would result if it became subject to export controls. In December, another group of scientists wrote an opposing letter through the Foundation for Vaccine Research to highlight what it saw as the safety and security risks associated with the research (NASEM, 2016b: 54\u201355). (Although the controversy began over security concerns, the potential biosafety risks of an accidental release from a laboratory soon became equally important in the debates.) The divisions within the scientific community led the EC and its chief scientific advisor to request a study from the European Academies Scientific Advisory Council (EASAC) in 2014 in search of common ground (EASAC, 2015).

Experiments involving the creation of potential pandemic pathogens should be curtailed until there has been a quantitative, objective and credible assessment of the risks, potential benefits, and opportunities for risk mitigation, as well as comparison against safer experimental approaches. A modern version of the Asilomar process, which engaged scientists in proposing rules to manage research on recombinant DNA, could be a starting point to identify the best approaches to achieve the global public health goals of defeating pandemic disease and assuring the highest level of safety. Whenever possible, safer approaches should be pursued in preference to any approach that risks an accidental pandemic (Cambridge Working Group, 2014).\n",

The results of such research are often unanticipated and accrue over time; therefore, risk-benefit analyses are difficult to assess accurately.\nIf we expect to continue to improve our understanding of how microorganisms cause disease we cannot avoid working with potentially dangerous pathogens. In recognition of this need, significant resources have been invested globally to build and operate BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities, and to mitigate risk in a variety of ways, involving regulatory requirements, facility engineering and training. Ensuring that these facilities operate safely and are staffed effectively so that risk is minimized is our most important line of defence, as opposed to limiting the types of experiments that are done (Scientists for Science, 2014).\n",

IAP mobilized its member academies to establish a Biosecurity Working Group. The Working Group's original membership has grown to include the national academies of Australia, China, Cuba, Egypt, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Over the years the Working Group has engaged with international organizations, in particular the BWC, to highlight the implications of trends in science and technology for the Convention and international security more broadly, and to support outreach and education projects to promote attention to biosecurity.
