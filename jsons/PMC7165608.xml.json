            "text": "A major challenge in ecology is to understand how species assemblages, often composed by tens, hundreds, or even thousands of species, change in space and time and are influenced by environmental variables. Community ecologists rely heavily on a plethora of methods to analyze these high\u2010dimensional multivariate data (e.g., k\u2010means, hierarchical clustering, network methods, and model\u2010based approaches) (Bloomfield, Knerr, & Encinas\u2010Viso, 2017; Foster, Hill, & Lyons, 2017; Legendre & Legendre, 2012). Such approaches attempt to identify groups of species that tend to co\u2010occur in space and time. For example, in a spatial context, these approaches have attempted to identify geographic areas with similar taxa, areas that have been variously called \u201cbiogeographical regions\u201d (Gonzales\u2010Orozco, Thornhill, Knerr, Laffan, & Miller, 2014), \u201cbioregions\u201d (Bloomfield et al., 2017), or \u201cbiogeographical modules\u201d (Carstensen et al., 2012). Such bioregions have been argued to be important for understanding the role of history on community assemblages (Carstensen et al., 2012, 2013), interpreting ecological dynamics (Economo et al., 2015), and developing broad\u2010scale conservation strategies (Vilhena & Antonelli, 2015).",

            "text": "The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; not to be confused with linear discriminant analysis) model is a powerful model\u2010based method to decompose species assemblage data into groups of species that tend to co\u2010occur in space and/or time. The benefits of using this model include the ability to adequately represent uncertainty, accommodate missing data, and, perhaps most importantly, to describe sampling units as comprised of multiple groups (i.e., mixed\u2010membership [MM] units) (Valle, Baiser, Woodall, & Chazdon, 2014). Conceptually, the ability to describe sampling units as comprised of multiple groups has rarely been considered in previous methods (i.e., prior approaches are typically based on \u201chard\u201d partitions) but may better honor community dynamics and may better characterize impacts of environmental change. For instance, biome transition zones, ecotones, and habitat edges are locations that are often comprised of a mix of species groups, providing sources for potentially novel species interactions (Gosz, 1993; Ries, Fletcher, Battin, & Sisk, 2004). Similarly, climate change is predicted to cause geographic shifts in species and communities, leading to the hypothesis of novel assemblages arising across space as climate and habitat changes (Urban et al., 2016; Williams & Jackson, 2007). In addition, most partitioning methods that delineate biogeographical regions or modules based on hard boundaries can lead to high uncertainty in boundary delineation\u2014an issue that can be rectified by allowing groups to overlap. It is important to note that LDA allows for overlapping groups, but it does not require it to be present (i.e., if data do not support overlap, no overlap is estimated).",

In the absence of abundance data, researchers often have to rely on presence/absence data to understand species distributions and biodiversity patterns (Jones, 2011; Joseph, Field, Wilcox, & Possingham, 2006). Another limitation of the LDA model is that the number of groups has to be prespecified, requiring researchers to run LDA multiple times to then use some criterion (e.g., AIC) to choose the optimal number of groups (e.g., Valle et al., 2014), an approach that often can be computationally costly.",

We adopt the term species group (instead of \u201cbioregion\u201d or other related terms) because these major co\u2010occurrence patterns do not have to have a strong spatial pattern (although they often do), these groups can overlap in space, and proportion of groups can change through time. More specifically, our method characterizes each sampling unit l in terms of the proportion of the different groups (parameter vector \u03b8l) and characterizes each group k in terms of the probability of the different species (parameter vector \u03d5k). For example, \u03b8l=0.1,0.8,0.1,0 indicates that the second group dominates unit l and that the fourth group is absent. This example also illustrates that a given sampling unit can be comprised of multiple groups, which explains why these types of models are called mixed\u2010membership models. In the same way, \u03d5k=0,0.8,0.8 indicates that species 2 and 3 (but not species 1) are important species of group k. Note that a given species can have a high probability in more than one group.

This prior also helps to avoid label switching, a common problem in mixed\u2010membership and mixture models. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms applied to these types of models sometimes mix poorly and can lead to nonsensical results if posterior distributions of parameters are summarized by their averages (Stephens, 2000). The label switching problem refers to the fact that the labels of the different groups can change (e.g., groups 1 and 2 can become groups 2 and 1, respectively) without changing the likelihood (i.e., the group labels are unidentifiable). Our truncated stick\u2010breaking prior helps to avoid the label switching problem by enforcing an ordering of the groups according to their overall proportions.",

To illustrate this, assume that there are just two species groups and two species, s and s\u2019. Negative correlation between these species is captured by our model if, for example, \u03d5^s=10 and \u03d5^s\u2032=01. These parameter estimates indicate that, whenever a site has a high proportion of group 1, species s will have a high probability of occurring, whereas species s\u2019 will tend to be absent. In the same way, whenever a site has a high proportion of group 2, species s\u2019 will have a high probability of occurring but species s will tend to be absent, resulting in negative correlation. Positive correlation between these species is captured by our model if, for example, \u03d5^s=0.950.1 and \u03d5^s\u2032=0.80.05. These parameter estimates imply that, whenever a site has a high proportion of group 1, both species s and s\u2019 will have a high probability of occurring.

Similarly, if all locations have similar proportions of the different groups (i.e., similar \u03b8lk), then all locations will have very similar species composition, regardless of how different the species groups are from a species composition perspective. This is due to the fact that the probability of observing species s for two locations p and q is given by Exisp=\u03b8pT\u03d5s and Exisq=\u03b8qT\u03d5s, respectively. If \u03b8pT\u2248\u03b8qT, then Exisp\u2248Exisq (see Supporting Information Appendix S1 for details).

This resulted in the exclusion of 48% (rare species) and 3% (common species such as American Robin, Mourning Dove, and American Crow) of the species. The rationale for this decision is that species that are too rare tend to convey little information on groups while species that are common everywhere are likely to be important species in almost all groups, contributing little to discriminate between these groups. Similar decisions are made when other clustering methods are used in ecology (e.g., Azeria et al., 2009) and when the standard LDA is used for text\u2010mining, where both low\u2010 and high\u2010frequency words are often removed prior to running the model (Boyd\u2010Graber, Mimno, & Newman, 2014). Finally, the BBS actually records count data (rather than presence/absence) per stop in each route. However, because these counts may include the same individual observed multiple times and bird detection may vary by species and environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic noise), we decided to convert these data into presence/absence of each species per route.

We also find a good correspondence between the true and estimated parameter values for most of the scenarios explored (scatterplots in Figure 1), with a slightly worse performance for data with few species but many groups (i.e., 50 species and 10 groups; Figure 1g,h). Taken together, these results suggest that, when the ratio of the number of species to the number of groups is small, there is likely to be less distinction between groups from a species composition perspective, making it a harder task to untangle these groups. Finally, in relation to the prior, we find that our results are broadly similar for \u03b3=0.1 and \u03b3=1. The main difference is that parameter estimates tended to be slightly worse when the true number of groups is 3 and \u03b3=1 and when the true number of groups is 10 and \u03b3=0.1 (results not shown), agreeing with our expectations. Because smaller \u03b3 values induce greater sparseness, parameters are better estimated with \u03b3=0.1 when simulations are based on sparse assumptions (i.e., simulations with three groups) versus when this is not true (i.e., simulations with 10 groups).",

On the other hand, Figure 2 clearly reveals that hard clustering methods cannot represent these MM locations (k\u2010means and hierarchical clustering [HC] panels in Figure 2). Mixture model approaches such as RCP are sometimes perceived to be able to represent these gradual changes in the proportion of groups. However, our results reveal that, when applied to our simulated data, RCP tended to give transition regions that were too narrow (RCP panels in Figure 2). These model comparison results are particularly striking given that LDA was fitted assuming 20 potential groups, whereas results for the other methods were based on the assumption that the true number of groups was known. Notice that these figures illustrate how LDA can capture gradual changes in species composition associated with global change phenomena depending on what is being represented in the x\u2010axis. For instance, the x\u2010axis can represent a spatial gradient of anthropogenic forest disturbance (e.g., timber logging intensity or distance to forest edge) or can represent time (i.e., the same location sampled repeatedly through time, perhaps revealing the impact of climate change on species composition).",

This positive association reveals that increases in proportion tend to occur at higher latitudes whereas decreases are more likely at lower latitudes (Figure 6), supporting the hypothesis that breeding bird groups are increasingly expanding their range toward northern areas while contracting their range at southern boundaries. The remaining nine groups did not have a statistically significant association between latitude and changes in proportion. Although this analysis ignores uncertainty in parameter estimates for \u03b8lk2010\u22122015\u2010\u03b8lk1997\u22122002, it is nevertheless useful in highlighting relatively subtle but important trends.

For these reasons, presence/absence data are typically much more ubiquitous than abundance data, often enabling analysis at much larger spatial and temporal scales than that afforded by abundance data.

For example, we illustrate how these groups gradually change along a temperature gradient in the East Coast and a precipitation gradient in Texas. It has long been known that many bird species have strong relationships with abiotic gradients (Bowen, 1933), but how these gradients can explain entire groups of species has remained elusive. Furthermore, we find subtle but pervasive changes in bird group proportions, changes which follow the expected patterns based on climate change (e.g., Parmesan & Yohe, 2003). Half of the species groups (nine of 18) have expanded their northern range and shrunken their southern range. This pattern is consistent with species\u2010specific models of changes in bird distribution with climate change in the United States (e.g., Hitch & Leberg, 2007; La Sorte & Thompson, 2007). Our results expand on these findings by illustrating how entire groups are shifting their spatial distribution. Nevertheless, a more formal test that accounts for the multiple factors that influence the spatial distribution of birds will be required to ultimately confirm whether climate change is driving the spatial distribution shifts that we have detected.",

In other words, \u03b8lk may change with time but \u03d5ks does not. This is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where it is possible that the species composition of the groups themselves might be changing (Lurgi, Lopez, & Montoya, 2012; Stralberg et al., 2009; Urban et al., 2016). Another important limitation in this study is that the proposed model does not take into account imperfect detection, a pervasive issue for wildlife sampling (MacKenzie et al., 2002; Royle, 2004). This shortcoming can be partially attributed to inherent limitations in the BBS dataset, given that the estimation of detection probabilities requires very specific data types (e.g., repeated visits in occupancy models). It is also critical to highlight the importance of repeated observations per location given the relatively low information content in binary presence/absence data. Determining all the parameters in the proposed model, including the optimal number of groups, can be challenging in the absence of these repeated observations. Finally, although important broad\u2010scale patterns can be identified and novel insights gained from post hoc analysis of LDA model parameters, as illustrated with our case study, these results rely on a two\u2010stage analysis that does not take into uncertainty in the estimated parameters. Our ongoing work is focused on extending LDA to accommodate covariates through regression models built\u2010in to LDA so that uncertainty can be coherently propagated when performing more formal statistical tests and when making spatial and temporal predictions.",

We acknowledge, however, that the modeler still has to specify the hyperparameter \u03b3 and the maximum number of groups K. Using simulated data, we have found that setting \u03b3 to 0.1 often works well and that our model often identifies K groups if the true number of groups is equal or larger than K. While this may be seen as an indication that K has to be increased when using real data, an extremely large number of groups defeats the purpose of dimension reduction, making it increasingly harder to visualize and interpret model outputs.

Numbers in the title of each panel correspond to species group identifiers. Spearman's correlation coefficients between latitude and changes in proportion of each group between 1997\u20132002 and 2010\u20132015 are given in the upper right corner of each panel, and level of significance is indicated by asterisk (* 0.01 < p < 0.05, ** 0.001 < p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). Trend lines were created by dividing the latitude range into 10 equally spaced bins and calculating the median (thick black line) and lower and upper quartiles (dashed black lines) for each bin. Bins with <10 observations were excluded. Results are based only on BBS routes within the range of each group, defined as locations for which \u03b8lk1997\u22122002>0.05 or \u03b8lk2010\u22122015>0.05\n",
