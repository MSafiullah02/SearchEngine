Finally, we agree with the idea of further studying this recently described varicella-like 57 exanthem in order to clarify how we can distinguish it from other dermatosis and use it 58 to identify otherwise asymptomatic patients to test them earlier. But even today, when it 59 seems that all of our patients are affected of COVID-19 and all the skin diseases may be 60 related to COVID-19, we must keep in mind that other dermatological diseases still 61 exist. That is why we think that when we face a patient presenting with a varicella-like 62 rash, we should perform Tzanck smear, virus culture, PCR on the vesicle fluid and/or 63 skin biopsy in order to rule out disseminated forms of other common viral infections.

However, only Marzano et al. 36 article included scarce clinical images due to safety or logistic concerns. 37 These past few weeks we are living an epidemic situation in Spain, considered by the 38 World Health Organization as an area of SARS-Cov-2 of community transmission, 39 especially in Madrid 3 . Since then, we began to observe different skin manifestations in 40 patients with COVID-19 infection. We encountered three in-ward patients during the 41 last few weeks, all with microbiologically proven COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab, 42 and all of them presenting with vesicles(Table 1,",
