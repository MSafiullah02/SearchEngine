Animal models suggest the area under the curve (AUC) has the closest association with improved mortality. 2 A single multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study assessed the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of PRV in pediatric patients during the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A epidemic. 3 The authors concluded that a standardized, weight-based dosing regimen in pediatric patients had similar efficacy and safety outcomes when compared with adult patients. 3, 4 However, this investigation appears to have excluded pediatric patients with a disease severity necessitating admission to the intensive care unit. 3 Drug development programs commonly evaluate a drug's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in healthy adult and pediatric subjects. 5 Commonly anti-infective drugs are not widely evaluated in the population in which they are intended to be used.

The two primary options are to either increase the dose (mg/kg or total mg dose) or adjust the dosing interval to allow for more frequent drug administration. Current recommendations state that upon dilution of PRV to a concentration suitable for administration it should be administered immediately or stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 24 hours; unused diluted solution should be discarded after 24 hours. 1 Combining this pharmacokinetic data with the limited stability information, utilizing a more frequent dosing regimen (i.e., every 8 or every 12 hours) may allow for reduced PRV waste, which depicts our approach to dosing regimen modifications in our patient population. These pharmacokinetic alterations are not unexpected as similar changes have previously been described in the PICU setting. 10-15, 22, 23 As TDM becomes more common to the practice of caring for critically ill children, recognition of pharmacokinetic variations similar to those described here will most likely become customary. The 1997 Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the prevention of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals suggested \". . .appropriate antimicrobial stewardship, that includes optimal drug selection, dose, and duration of treatment, as well as control of antibiotic use, will prevent or slow the emergence of resistance among microorganisms.\" 24 Often a \"one dose fits all\" mindset hinders clinicians in the treatment of infectious diseases; a paradigm that needs to end. 25 Reliance on an \"approved dose\" rather than achieving the target serum concentrations and exposures associated with safety and efficacy during the drug development and regulatory process is problematic. Underdosing and low exposures have been associated with anti-infective resistance and increased morbidity and mortality, 12 whereas active management of antiinfective concentrations and exposures has been associated with improved outcomes. 5, 12, [26] [27] [28] The concept of replacing \"approved dose\" with \"approved concentrations and exposures\" and tailoring dosing regimens to individual patients considering inter-and intra-patient variability across populations is profound. 25 With a growing body of literature demonstrating the benefit of anti-infective TDM, optimization of anti-infective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can dramatically change how infections are treated, allowing for customized and optimized anti-infective dosing, and allowing for a longer \"life-span\" of the currently approved antimicrobial agents and future anti-infective pipeline. Similar to pharmacokinetic reports described previously, 11, 12 there are several limitations regarding this pharmacokinetic case series. First, this is a single center's experience utilizing PRV for suspected or confirmed influenza viral infections. Second, a single pharmacodynamic target was utilized and there is still debate regarding the optimal clinical pharmacodynamic target(s). Third, blood concentrations serve as a surrogate marker and do not necessarily reflect the PRV concentrations at other actual or potential sites of infection. However, blood samples are more readily available and analyzable and are likely to correlate with the concentrations at the site of infection. Fourth, drug concentration measurements were performed as total drug and not unbound drug concentrations with a static protein binding estimate. Fifth, we utilized an opportunistic sampling strategy which may not be ideal to fully characterize the pharmacokinetics of PRV in each individual child. Sixth, repeat PRV levels were not obtained to demonstrate whether the dosage adjustments resulted in expected observed concentrations based on the dosing calculation adjustments and whether concentrations might potentially be supra-therapeutic. However, individual parameter estimates are capable of providing a reasonable pharmacokinetic profile for individual patients and are commonly employed in clinical practice for aminoglycosides and vancomycin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 186, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 425, "end": 427, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 641, "end": 643, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 864, "end": 866, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 867, "end": 869, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1010, "text": "1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1012, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1272, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1561, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2090, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2485, "end": 2498, "text": "10-15, 22, 23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3243, "end": 3245, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3569, "end": 3571, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3688, "end": 3690, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3691, "end": 3694, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3695, "end": 3699, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3700, "end": 3704, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3705, "end": 3709, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3929, "end": 3931, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 4375, "end": 4378, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 4379, "end": 4381, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 870, "end": 877, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The pharmacokinetics of PRV demonstrated in this PICU cohort differs in comparison to Half-life (hrs) 20 \"Similar to PI\" Vd (L/kg) 0.18 \"Similar to PI\" CL (ml/min/kg) 0.1 \"Similar to PI\" Peak (lg/ml) 46.8 33.1 AUC (lg/hr/ml) 102.7 \"Similar to PI\" \"Similar to PI\" = the authors of the trial 3 do not provide actual values yet explicitly state \"similar to PI\" in their manuscript.
