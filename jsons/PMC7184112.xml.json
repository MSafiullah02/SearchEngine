Although restrictive measures, including the unprecedented lockdown of the city on 23 January 2020, were introduced by the Chinese government to contain the spread of the virus, many more cases were detected in Wuhan and far beyond [3\u20139]. As of 9 March 2020, there were >80 000 confirmed cases and the death toll had risen to 3123 in China. It had also spread to \u2265100 countries outside of China and a public health emergency of international concern had been declared by the World Health Organization. While the virus was reported to originate in the Huanan seafood market, which was closed in January 2020 [1], human-to-human transmission had occurred and became the dominant way for the virus to spread [5\u201310]. The epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of the virus are being investigated worldwide in order to provide better strategies to contain the spread of the virus [3\u201311].",

It is also unclear whether timely and appropriate medical care was provided to suspected patients to facilitate early detection and isolation of infected patients, given that the disease burden significantly increased in Wuhan during this period and there was much higher mortality than outside the city. Although confirmed cases are decreasing in Wuhan, a better understanding of these features is important to curb the spread of the virus and reduce the mortality elsewhere in the world, since a similar outbreak is happening in several other cities, including those in South Korea, Italy and Iran. In this study, we investigated the epidemiological and clinical features, and the medical care-seeking process of confirmed COVID-19 patients to assess the epidemic dynamics and disease burden in Wuhan, in order to provide useful information to contain COVID-19 in other places with outbreaks of the virus.",

These patients were transferred from designated hospitals for diagnosis of viral infection once they were confirmed with COVID-19 by real-time RT-PCR assay. We recruited patients admitted between 7 and 26 February 2020 in areas A and B, where male and female patients were admitted, respectively. Patients whose symptoms worsened during their stay at Fangcang hospital and needed more advanced medical care were transferred to a well-equipped hospital. A repeated PCR test was given to the patients when they had no fever for \u22653 days and significant relief of other symptoms occurred, to determine whether the patients met the discharge criteria. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shanghai East Hospital (Shanghai, China) and verbal consent was obtained from each patient.",

            "text": "A better understanding of transmission patterns is critical to curb infectious diseases [12]. The outbreak of COVID-19 is believed to have originated from the Huanan seafood market; later studies found there were more and more patients with no link to this market, possibly due to human-to-human transmission spread of this virus [13\u201316]. However, further analysis of human-to-human transmission is currently unknown due to the implementation of quarantine measures and restricted travel. Many restrictive policies, including home quarantine and traffic control, were applied in Wuhan after the city was locked down. This led to a dramatically changed lifestyle forf the people in the city and may change transmission dynamic of the virus. Thus, it is important to investigate the new transmission features to contain the spread of this virus in Wuhan and other cities where these restrictive measures have been applied.",

In addition, separate spaces were required when providing medical care to patients with respiratory symptoms to avoid hospital-acquired infections. Importantly, as many as 51% of patients had no known contact with suspected or confirmed patients. This indicates that more effort is needed to detect the actual epidemiological features. Besides medical providers, more epidemiologists are urgently needed to take part in curbing the spread of the virus.",

This indicates that a shortage of medical resources occurred due to the surge in infected patients at the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan. Moreover, it also suggests there may be a substantial number of patients who were not identified in a timely fashion and, therefore, may have promoted transmission between family members. Different models have been generated to estimate the number of cases in the epicentre of the outbreak [13], but no first-hand information regarding this is available to date [15]. Our report therefore provides useful information for further analysis. As >40 000 medical providers and more medical supplies, including diagnostic PCR kits for the virus, have been deployed to the city, more rapid detection of patients with COVID-19 is expected.",
