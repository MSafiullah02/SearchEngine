Again the laboratory confirmation of H1N1 may take days. We had come across the situation where the need of mechanical ventilators was out of proportion to the resources available in the hospital during peak incidences of H1N1. While awaiting confirmation, it is justified to use NIV in the scenario of nonavailability of invasive ventilator.",

We should not compare the nosocomial outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with that of H1N1 infection due to NIV. The virulence and secondary attack rate of SARS were much higher.
