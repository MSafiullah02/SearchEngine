            "text": "A highly contagious atypical pneumonia first appeared in the Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China, in November 2002. This was not widely publicized, and the condition remained isolated to China for the next 3 months. On February 21, 2003, a Chinese physician from the Guangdong Province (patient A in Figure 1\n) who cared for patients with pneumonia and had himself developed symptoms traveled to Hong Kong to visit relatives. He stayed on the ninth floor of Hotel M for a day. On February 22, 2003, he was admitted to Hospital 2 with fever and respiratory symptoms and died of respiratory failure on March 4, 2003. He infected 2 of his family members and 4 health care workers (HCWs) in Hospital 2. In addition, 12 other hotel guests at Hotel M developed SARS, 10 of whom (patients B through K) were in the hotel the same day as patient A; the other 2 patients (patients L and M) stayed in the hotel during the time that 3 other symptomatic patients were guests at the hotel. Because of international travel and transmission to HCWs before the institution of protective measures, these patients were responsible for subsequent clusters of SARS around the globe. Patient B was the index patient for the outbreak in Hanoi involving HCWs and close contacts, including Dr Urbani. Patients C, D, and E were the index cases in Singapore. Patients F and G traveled back to Toronto, Canada, which resulted in the cluster of cases in Toronto. Patients H and J caused outbreaks among HCWs in other hospitals in Hong Kong. Patient L appears to have become infected during his stay at Hotel M, with subsequent transmission to his wife, patient M in the United States (Figure 1).",

Through this and other measures, including screening of passengers at airports and seaports, concentration of patients in a single SARS-designated hospital, imposition of a no-visitors rule for all public hospitals, and use of a dedicated private ambulance service to transport all possible cases to the SARS-designated hospital, Singapore may have successfully controlled its outbreak and reported its last case on May 11, 2003. Hong Kong instituted a program of intensive contact tracing and home quarantine of all contacts and has reported a substantial decline in the number of new cases. Authorities in Toronto initially appeared to have controlled their outbreak, but on May 22, Health Canada began to report new clusters of cases of SARS, and since then 70 new cases linked to 4 Toronto hospitals have been reported. Mainland China and Taiwan continue to report new cases, and there is ongoing community transmission, although the daily number of reported new probable cases of SARS has declined from a mean of 166 cases during the first week of May to a mean of 2.5 cases in the first week of June.",

These included inoculation and recovery of the virus in cell cultures, characterization of morphologic features by electron microscopy, serologic antibody determination, and molecular amplification and sequencing of the target RNA of the agent. Overall, 45 of the 50 patients these investigators studied had 1 or more laboratory tests (serology, 32; RT-PCR, 22; culture, 2) that supported a coronavirus etiology. The results of this initial report were quickly confirmed and expanded by collaborative studies in several major public health centers and medical institutions throughout the world coordinated by the World Health Organization.12, 13 Molecular sequencing analyses have indicated that the virus is only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. Based on serologic studies, it appears that this virus has not previously circulated in humans and is now referred to as SARS-CoV.14, 15\n",

Recent data suggest that the virus may remain viable for considerable periods on a dry surface (up to 24 hours); hence, transmission through fomites may occur. The outbreak in an apartment complex in Hong Kong that accounted for more than 300 cases has been attributed to fecal spread. A patient with SARS who had diarrhea stayed with his brother in this building. It is thought that infection spread from him to other residents in the building through a leaking sewage drain, which allowed aerosolization of virus-containing material. Sewage also backed into bathroom floor drains in some apartments and may have accounted for some of the transmission. The SARS-CoV is stable in feces (and urine) at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days. The virus is more stable (up to 4 days) in stool from patients with diarrhea (which has a higher pH than normal stool).16\n",

In all series of SARS cases described to date, therapy has involved broad-spectrum antibiotics, including a fluoroquinolone or macrolide. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in most patients treated in Hong Kong and in Toronto, without evidence of efficacy.7, 10 The adverse effects of ribavirin are significant, particularly hemolytic anemia and electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia; hence, empirical therapy with ribavirin is not warranted.",
