SARS originated in Southern China at the end of 2002, and was characterized by high mortality and morbidity in infected individuals. By July 31, 2003, more than 8000 SARS cases and nearly 800 SARS-related deaths were reported around the world. Studies on the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV suggest that the virus emerged from non-human sources (Guan et al., 2003). The civet cat coronavirus was shown to have a sequence identity of more than 99% to the SARS-CoV with only a limited number of deletions and mutations between both viruses. SARS-CoV was shown to have a deletion of 29 nucleotides relative to the civet cat virus, possibly suggesting that there was direct transmission from civet to humans (Guan et al., 2003). Virus transmission to humans may have occurred when civet cats, probably infected by bats, were traded on Chinese wet markets (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005b).",

Ribavirin in combination with corticosteroids was the most frequently administered antiviral agent during the SARS outbreak (Booth et al., 2003, Ho et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003a, Tsang et al., 2003, Tsui et al., 2003). However, ribavirin alone at nontoxic concentrations was found to have little in vitro activity against SARS-CoV (Cinatl et al., 2003), although an improved clinical outcome was reported among SARS patients receiving early administration of Kaletra plus ribavirin and corticosteroids (Tsang and Seto, 2004). At present, no clear evidence has been provided to support these clinical observations yet (Barnard and Kumaki, 2009). In several mouse models and in vitro, ribavirin was even found to enhance the SARS-CoV infection (Barnard et al., 2006a, Barnard et al., 2006b, Day et al., 2009). Therefore, development of new anti-SARS-CoV agents is urgently needed should SARS-CoV, or a virus closely related to it, emerge or re-emerge to cause disease.",

For example, antibodies to the SARS-CoV spike protein have been shown to block entry (Sui et al., 2004) and small peptides derived from the heptad repeat (HR) regions of SARS-CoV S protein have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV infection by the interference of SARS-CoV fusion with target cells (Bosch et al., 2004, Ho et al., 2006). Additionally, the main protease of SARS, which is essential for the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, has been a key target for developing anti-SARS drugs (Anand et al., 2003, Barnard and Kumaki, 2009, Yang et al., 2003). Antisense RNA and RNA interference (RNAi) technologies have shown potential in treating some severe diseases including SARS-CoV infection (Leonard and Schaffer, 2006). Interferons have also been considered as the first line of defense against viral infections. In earlier studies, we evaluated a few compounds approved for therapeutic use in humans and some in vitro inhibitors of SARS-CoV for inhibition in the mouse SARS-CoV replication model. A hybrid interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon inducer, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124), were shown to potently inhibit virus titers in the lungs of infected mice (Barnard et al., 2006a). We also demonstrated that interferon alfacon-1 inhibited SARS-CoV infection in human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells (Kumaki et al., 2008).",

            "text": "To evaluate the prophylactic potential of antivirals directed against SARS-CoV infection, new lethal animal models for SARS are needed to facilitate antiviral research. We previously adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5\u20136-week-old BALB/c mice (Day et al., 2009). A number of compounds were tested for efficacy in SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice, including UDA. We earlier reported that UDA was partially protective in SARS-CoV-infected mice (Day et al., 2009). UDA at 5 mg/kg/day was shown to significantly delay the mean day of death compared to the average onset of death for animals receiving physiological sterile saline (PSS) (6.2 \u00b1 1.7 days, p\n < 0.01). However, only 50% of the UDA-treated animals survived. Nevertheless, visual lung scores for both day 3 and day 6 for all lectin treatments in that experiment were lower than those observed in the lungs of placebo-treated mice. In addition, weight reduction changes from day 0 to day 4 (difference between day 0 and day 4 weights) were also less for lectin-treated animals than for PSS-treated mice. These data suggest that UDA treatment of mice did ameliorate the lethality and some of the associated lung pathogenesis in mice infected with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Furthermore, a higher concentration of UDA was tested to determine its efficacy in reducing lethality and ameliorating the pathogenesis in mice infected with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Our data showed that increasing the concentration of UDA treatment to 15 mg/kg/day did not increase the efficacy of UDA compared to UDA used at 5 mg/kg/day. Because of the positive results obtained from in vitro assays and the initial studies showing the efficacy of UDA treatment in significantly reducing mortality in the lethal SARS-CoV mouse model, UDA was further evaluated in the lethal mouse model for SARS-CoV to see if efficacy could be improved. We optimized the dosage regimen to increase the effectiveness of UDA against SARS-CoV in BALB/c mouse model in terms of survival. We also further investigated the mode of action of UDA in vitro.",

This protection against weight loss was significant for all UDA treatment groups by day 12, at which time at least 50% of the mice survived in all of the treatment groups (Fig. 2\n). All mice receiving UDA or poly IC:LC went on to gain weight by the end of the experiment that was equal to or exceeded the original body weight recorded at the initiation of the study (Table 2). For this experiment, 90% of the mice receiving the calculated LD90 dose died as expected (Fig. 2). The most significantly efficacious dose of UDA used for treating infected mice was UDA at 5 mg/kg/day. At this dose, mice were significantly protected against weight loss by day 6 (Table 2, p\n < 0.05) and thereafter, all mice were protected against death due to virus infection (p\n < 0.001, Fig. 2). Further analysis of death revealed that this same dose of UDA significantly enhanced the ratio of live mice to total mice in the treatment group (p\n < 0.01) and obviously increased the mean day of death (p\n < 0.05, Table 3\n). Interestingly, the 10 mg/kg/day dose of UDA also afforded significant protection against death when evaluating all parameters of death, and also protected against weight loss (Fig. 2 and Table 2, Table 3). In contrast, the higher dose of 20 mg/kg/day was not nearly as protective against death, was slightly toxic in uninfected mice at day 2 and day 3 after treatment (Fig. 1), and did not ameliorate weight loss in infected, treated mice during the critical days of infection (days 3\u20139) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). However, this dose still prolonged the survival of mice as evidenced by the fact that the median day of death (the calculated day on which most mice died) was 16 days. In addition, even when mice treated with UDA at 20 mg/kg/day, they were almost 3-times less likely to die as rapidly as mice treated with placebo (see hazard ratio, Table 3). This suggests that the 10 mg/kg/day dose of UDA might be the maximum tolerated efficacious dose.",

We have also shown that UDA inhibited retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike (S) infection in vitro, suggesting that a function of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein might be targeted by UDA. This in vitro inhibitory activity also translated into inhibition of virus-induced mortality in a lethal SARS-CoV challenge model of mice, but did not reduce the virus lung titers. One possibility to explain the efficacy of UDA in spite of not significantly reducing virus titers may be attributed to the putative mechanism of action supported by the data previously described. It is likely that UDA inhibits attachment and thus limits spread of virus from infected cells to uninfected cells by binding to released virus to prevent attachment to uninfected cells. Since in the current study entire lungs were harvested, homogenized, and titrated for virus, there would be no way of differentiating intracellular infectious virus from virus released from infected cells. If bronchial fluids from lung lavages had been assayed for virus, there may have well been a decrease in titers of released extracellular virus in response to UDA treatment, especially at day 3 and day 4 when maximal virus titers from lung homogenates are achieved.",

Similar findings have also been reported (Chen and Subbarao, 2007). Yen et al. (2006) showed that human monocytic THP-1 cell line was susceptible to SARS-CoV. In that study, SARS-CoV induced THP-1 cells to express MCP-1, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, IP-10, MIP-1\u03b2, and RANTES. Li et al. (2005a) reported that RANTES inhibited SARS-CoV replication in THP-1 cells when added into the culture at the same time with the SARS-CoV or before, but not after, infection. In this report, significantly high levels of mouse RANTES in the lungs of BALB/c mice were detected when SARS-CoV-infected mice were treated with UDA or poly IC:LC, indicating that elevated RANTES inhibits the disease progression. In addition, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and MCP-1 were more strongly expressed in SARS-CoV-infected mice. IL-6 and MCP-1 have also been observed in human SARS patients (Chen and Subbarao, 2007). Jiang et al. (2005) demonstrated that superinfection after immune injury and acute respiratory distress as well as lung failure are the main causes of death. The rapid increase of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 is a sign of superinfection, indicating a high risk of death. Conversely, we observed that detectable levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-1\u03b1 dropped when BALB/c mice were treated with UDA or poly IC:LC.

SARS-CoV antigens have been detected in alveolar epithelial cells (primarily type II pneumocytes), bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages of the respiratory tract (Ding et al., 2004, Ye et al., 2007). All of these cell types have ACE2 (Li et al., 2003). CD209L is expressed in human lung on type II alveolar cells and can mediate infection by SARS-CoV (Jeffers et al., 2004). SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein attaches to use both ACE2 and CD209L in the early steps of viral infection. Because previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell surface lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (Marzi et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004), it needs to be further determined whether UDA blocks binding of SARS-CoV to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. The in vitro data suggest that the mode of inhibition of the lectin UDA might be binding to the virion to prevent adsorption, perhaps by UDA binding to the epitope found on the SARS-CoV spike protein that binds to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR.",

            "text": "Many enveloped viruses have glycoproteins on their surface. These glycoproteins are mediators of the receptor binding and membrane fusion of the virion with the host cells. Therefore, they are attractive therapeutic targets for novel antiviral therapies. When van der Meer et al. (2007) used an immunoperoxidase staining assay and a luciferase-based assay to evaluate the antiviral activity of UDA, they showed that UDA inhibited Nidovirales in vitro. These assays are based on the number of infected cells and expression of viral proteins. UDA binds to the viral glycoproteins to inhibit virus entry into the target cells (Balzarini, 2007). O\u2019Keefe et al. (2010) recently reported that a potent antiviral lectin griffithsin (GRST), a 12.7 kDa protein originally isolated from red alga Griffithsia sp., inhibited SARS-CoV infection both in vitro and in vivo. GRST is known to bind not only to N-acetylglucosamine, but also to mannose in a multivalent manner via its three independent carbohydrate-binding domains (Ziolkowska et al., 2006). GRST specifically bound to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein to inhibit viral entry likely because SARS-CoV spike protein is heavily glycosylated and contains 23 putative N-glycosylation sites (Krokhin et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). We also confirmed that the inhibitory effects of SARS-CoV infection were observed when UDA was added to the live SARS-CoV Urbani strain or SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus for 1 h before inoculation, suggesting UDA might react directly with SARS-CoV. Based on these observations, we further examined whether UDA would affect the binding site to cell-surface sugar chains in Vero 76 or 293T-ACE2 cells. UDA had been removed after 1 h treatment and both cells had been washed with the medium before infection. No reduction in viral CPE was observed. Our data suggest that UDA did not affect the binding site to cell-surface sugar chains at all. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UDA neutralized the virus infectivity, presumably by binding to the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein.",

They demonstrated that the majority (30% of total glycans), N-glycans were high-mannose hybrid (28%) and bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex glycans (42%). Many of the terminal residues of the antennary couples appeared to be N-acetylglucosamine, the glycan to which UDA preferentially binds. However, the authors did not map the positions of these residues within the S protein or determine whether this clustering of N-glycans complexes in S1 attachment portion of the S protein or the S2 fusion portion of the protein. Nevertheless, the data support our conclusion that UDA likely binds to the S protein via N-acetylglucosamine residues of the SARS-CoV S protein to inhibit attachment to cells, thereby preventing virus infection of cells.",

For example, it has been found that UDA might function as a superantigenic lectin in activating T-cell responses and cytokine production (Galelli and Truffa-Bachi, 1993). The mechanism of immune modulation is also supported by the significant increase in RANTES levels in infected mice receiving UDA treatment compared to RANTES levels detected in un-treated, infected mice.
