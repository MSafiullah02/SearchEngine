Consequently, as a percentage, there was no significant change in specific mortality (the percentage of cold-related mortality). RES now contributes to most cold-related deaths, despite influenza immunisation, but other clinically important respiratory viruses such as coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and rhinoviruses still circulate in wintertime. The absence of any decline in specific mortality particularly after the introduction of winter fuel payments (a state benefit paid to all pensioners to help with heating costs) in 1997 could be due to a trend towards wearing more casual but less warm clothing and elderly people spending more time outdoors where they are exposed to the cold.",

The seasonality of mortality has always been greater in older age groups partly because of the reduced thermal perception and body\u2019s heat-generating capacity. As exposure to the cold can occur both indoors and outdoors,1, 11 it may be worthwhile raising the age threshold for the winter fuel allowance and directing aid to neglected areas such as public transport waiting areas and community centres.
