            "text": "In children and adults, the classic signs of meningeal irritation are nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign, and Brudzinski's sign. Nuchal rigidity is present when the patient has resistance to passive fl exion of the neck. Kernig's sign is elicited by fl exing the thigh and knee while the patient is in the supine position; in the presence of meningeal infl ammation, there is resistance to passive extension of the leg at the knee with the thigh fl exed. Brudzinski's sign is positive when passive fl exion of the neck causes fl exion of the hips and knees. Neurologic complications are frequently associated with bacterial meningitis. Seizures occur in 40% of cases. Generalized seizures usually occur early due to fever, metabolic derangements, or toxic factors (eg, alcohol withdrawal); focal sei-g g zures are more likely to occur after 4 to 10 days and are caused by arterial thrombosis, cortical vein thrombosis, or abscess formation. Cranial nerve (CN) palsies, especially of CN III, VI, VII, and VIII, are due to purulent exudates in the arachnoid sheaths of the specifi c cranial nerve. Sensorineural hearing loss is a major complication in infants and children, occurring in 30% of cases. Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure may be due to noncommunicating hydrocephalus caused by basilar exudates, or to exudates in the Virchow-Robin spaces invading the parenchyma. Focal cerebral signs are most likely to occur at the end of the fi rst week of infection but may occur later as well; they are due to arterial thrombosis causing infarction, cortical vein thrombosis with secondary hemorrhagic infarction, or abscess formation. Meningococcus is the only bacterium that frequently causes a rash, which is probably the most important clue to the diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. It usually begins as a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash. As the rash evolves, petechiae and purpura appear primarily on the trunk and lower extremities. (From Roos et al. [ For bacterial meningitis to occur, the host usually acquires a new organism by colonization of the nasopharynx. This may lead to direct seeding of cerebral spinal fl uid (CSF) spaces, but more likely causes local spread to the sinuses or the lungs (pneumonia) or bacteremia, which then results in meningeal invasion.

Turbid CSF seen on visual inspection suggests more than 400 white cells per mm 3 . (Adapted from ( ( Durand et al. [5] .) Figure 12 -9. Causative organisms of bacterial meningitis by age-related relative frequency. Haemophilus influenzae type b was the leading cause of meningitis until widespread use of vaccine. Now H. influenzae is not a significant cause of bacterial meningitis in the vaccinated population [6] . Meningococcal meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis affects mostly children and young adults. As of 1995, N. meningitidis had replaced H. influenzae as the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in these age groups in the United States [7] . Congenital terminal complement deficiencies (C5-C8) predispose to meningococcemia. Pneumococcal meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. Predisposing factors include pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis, head trauma, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, sickle cell disease, splenectomy, diabetes and alcoholism. (Adapted from Schuchat et al. [8] .) CT scan done as part of a diagnostic work-up for acute bacterial meningitis. Diagnostic studies include blood cultures (three sets) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. In addition to routine CSF studies, specialized immunochemical tests should be performed in patients who have been partially treated, even with oral antibiotics. These special tests include latex agglutination, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, limulus amoebocyte lysate, and coagglutination. If the patient shows signs suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (impaired mental status, focal neurologic signs, papilledema, dilated nonreactive pupil, cranial nerve VI palsy), then a brain CT scan should be performed before lumbar puncture (LP). The CT scan may show diffuse cerebral edema (as here) or a focal lesion, which are contraindications to LP. (From Roos et al. [1] ; with permission.) Figure 12 -13. Differential diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis. Viral meningitis is a diagnostic consideration of very early bacterial meningitis. In viral meningitis, fever is not as prominent, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies usually reveal normal glucose levels and mononuclear pleocytosis, although polymorphonuclear neutrophils may be seen in the first 12 to 24 hours. In viral encephalitis, the CSF analysis is similar to that of viral meningitis, but mental status is altered. Tuberculous meningitis may be subacute or have a rapid downhill course, but mononuclear cells predominate in the CSF and usually the glucose level is low. Fungal meningitis has a more chronic course. CSF studies reveal a mononuclear pleocytosis and low glucose. Brain abscess and subdural empyema usually present with focal abnormalities on examination, increased intracranial pressure, and a CSF pleocytosis with normal glucose. Rocky Mountain spotted fever may clinically resemble bacterial meningitis, with patients exhibiting fever, headache, altered mental status, and a petechial rash. The rash is usually different than that seen in meningococcemia (see Fig. 12 -2), beginning on wrists and ankles, then spreading to the body and face; the mucous membranes are not involved. The CSF is usually normal, and a history of tick bite is elicited in 80% of patients. Bacterial endocarditis causes a new heart murmur; petechial lesions of the nailbeds, mucous membranes, and extremities; and hematuria, as well as altered mental status. Subarachnoid hemorrhage presents with sudden, excruciating headache, meningismus, fever at times, usually a normal mental status (unless intracerebral bleeding occurred), and CSF xanthochromia with a large number of red blood cells. Neoplastic meningitis (meningeal carcinomatosis) often causes cranial nerve palsies, mononuclear cells in the CSF, and low glucose levels;",

Several studies have demonstrated that dexamethasone decreases sensorineural hearing loss and improves neurologic outcome in children older than 2 months of age [10] as well as adults [11] .

Pneumococcal vaccine is indicated for all infants in addition to high-risk groups older than 2 years of age [12] .

            "text": "Bacterial infections Historical and examination clues to chronic meningitis. Exploring the history may reveal clues to an etiologic diagnosis, although unfortunately such a clue is not found in most cases, which does not exclude any of the possible diagnoses. The history can be explored in four major areas: exposure history, travel and geographic history, extraneural or systemic diseases, and immunologic deficiency. The physical examination of patients with chronic meningitis is directed at finding extraneural signs that provide clues to the central nervous system disease, identifying potential sites for biopsy, and documenting the exact location and extent of neurologic involvement. For example, skin and eye involvement support specific diagnoses, and skin, adenopathy, and organomegaly indicate potential biopsy sites. (Adapted from Roos and Bonnin [2] .) Symptoms and signs of tuberculous meningitis at presentation. The clinical presentation in children is somewhat different than that seen in adults. Nausea and vomiting as well as behavioral changes are more common in children, whereas headache is clearly more common in adults. Children also frequently complain of abdominal pain and constipation. In both groups, seizures increase in frequency with disease progression. On examination, fever and meningismus are the most common signs in both age groups, although the frequency varies greatly. Cranial nerve palsies are present in some patients at presentation but eventually occur in about half of all cases. The sixth cranial nerve is involved most commonly, followed by the third, fourth, and seventh cranial nerves. Examination of the optic fundus may reveal tubercles in a small percentage of patients. Funduscopic examination may also reveal papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure from hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus correlates well with the duration of disease and eventually occurs in most cases. Additional manifestations of central nervous system tuberculosis include the following discussed below. Caseating granulomas of epithelioid cells and macrophages containing mycobacteria may occur in the brain as single or multiple focal lesions. Infrequently, caseating necrosis occurs, forming a tuberculous (cold) abscess. Both lesions often occur without meningitis. Most often, the initial presentation of tuberculoma and abscess is similar to that of a brain tumor, with headaches from increased intracranial pressure, seizures, focal deficits, and altered mental status. Less frequently, seizure or focal deficits may be the first manifestations. The most common form of tuberculosis of the spine is epidural compression of the thoracic cord from vertebral and disc destruction by caseating granulomas (tuberculous osteomyelitis). Less frequently the lumbar or cervical spine may be affected. The clinical manifestations are those of chronic epidural cord compression with back pain increased alus, similar to fungal meningitis. A stroke syndrome has also been associated with tuberculous meningitis. (Adapted from the British Medical Research Council [14] .) with weight bearing; percussion tenderness over the spine; a spastic paraparesis, often with a sensory level; and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Localized and severe percussion spine tenderness with painful limitation of spinal motility is referred to as a \"spinal gibbus.\" Tuberculous meningomyelitis is the rare occurrence of infection of the spinal leptomeninges without spine involvement; it has also been referred to as spinal meningitis, spinal arachnoiditis, and spinal radiculomyelitis. Thick exudates and tubercles encase the nerve roots and spinal cord. This process presents as subacute to chronic radiculomyelitis or as cauda equina syndrome. It appears mainly in highly endemic areas but has been reported in AIDS patients in the United States. Intramedullary tuberculomas are rare and have clinical presentations similar to other spinal cord tumors. (Adapted from Zuger and Lowy [15] .) Tuberculous basilar meningitis. The tubercle bacillus enters the human host through inhalation. Airborne droplets reach the alveoli and multiply there or in alveolar and circulating macrophages. During this 2-to 4-week stage of infection, hematogenous dissemination occurs, and delayed secondary hematogenous dissemination may also occur. During dissemination, tubercles form in multiple organs, including the brain. Eventually tubercles rupture into the subarachnoid space or ventricular system to cause meningitis.",

In the first half of the 20th century, autopsy studies revealed that 5% to 10% of patients with TB had CNS involvement. TB in AIDS patients is thought to occur because of reactivation; most cases are pulmonary, but the incidence of extrapulmonary disease is much greater than that of the general population. Rates of tuberculin purified protein derivative reactivity are lower than those in the general population, ranging from 33% to 50% as compared to 50% to 90%. The incidence of CNS involvement is similar to that of the general population. (Adapted from Zuger and Lowy [15] .) Tuberculomas presenting with acute swelling and edema (TB brain abscess) should also be treated with steroids, in which case surgical removal may be required [18] .

            "text": "Empiric antibiotic therapy Therapy for intracranial epidural abscess consists of antibiotic therapy combined with neurosurgical drainage and decompression. Antibiotic therapy should be continued for 4 to 6 weeks and for 8 weeks with associated osteomyelitis. The prognosis for these epidural infections is excellent, with no mortality in recent series, probably because the process is usually subacute to chronic and CT and MRI are excellent diagnostic tools. The epidural space in the spinal cord is a true space, unlike the potential epidural intracranial space. In the spinal cord, the dura and arachnoid are closely approximated, so that the subdural space is only a potential space, and spinal subdural empyema or abscess is rare; spinal epidural abscess is much more common. Spinal epidural abscess is an emergency because spinal cord compression and paraplegia are possible rapid complications that can occur over hours. It can be acute (symptoms are present less than 2 weeks) or chronic (symptoms are present for more than 2 weeks); the acute form is more common. Four stages of progression of spinal epidural abscess have been recognized. The acute form presents as an acute cord compression. Progression CT scan of an epidural abscess revealing a lesion that is well-localized, extracerebral, hypodense, and lenticularly shaped, with a nonenhancing hyperdense medial capsule. Diagnosis of intracranial epidural abscess is made by CT or MRI. Even if the initial CT is not diagnostic, contrast-enhanced MRI scanning should clarify the diagnosis. The cerebrospinal fluid usually reveals a picture of a chronic parameningeal focus with mononuclear pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and sterile cultures. Differential diagnoses include epidural tumor, epidural hematoma, subdural hemorrhage, subdural empyema, dural sinus or cortical vein thrombosis, and less frequently, brain abscess or brain tumor. (From Weisberg et al. [21] ; with permission.) from stages I to II and from stages II to III usually takes 1 to 4 days each. Once stage III is reached, complete paralysis may occur in hours. In the acute form fever, malaise, and a \"flu-like\" prodrome may occur. The chronic form presents as an expanding tumor, usually without fever or other prodromal symptoms. Subdural empyema is a fulminant, purulent infection that spreads over the cerebral hemispheres in the existing subdural space. It is usually confined to one side of the brain by the anatomic barriers of the falx and tentorium. Undiagnosed and untreated, subdural empyema is rapidly fatal and therefore is a neurologic emergency. Usually patients have a nonspecific prodrome for several days to a week and then become acutely ill. After head trauma or surgery, the presentation may be milder and more subacute. The presenting manifestations usually include fever, headache, hemiparesis, nuchal rigidity, and seizures. As the process continues, increased intracranial pressure causes papilledema and alteration of consciousness. At the end of the first week and into the second, cortical vein thrombosis begins to occur, causing infarcts and additional focal deficits. (Adapted from Hartman et al. [24] .) Predisposing causes, pathogenesis, and etiology of subdural empyema. The vast majority of cases of subdural empyema occur in males (about 75%). It has been suggested that this is related to the growth of the frontal sinuses in boys during puberty. The most common predisposing cause of subdural empyema is sinusitis (54%). After infection has started in the sinuses, the middle ear, or other areas of the head, it spreads to the subdural space by means of venous drainage. Emissary veins connect the large veins of the scalp and face with the dural venous sinuses, and because the veins of the head and brain are valveless, retrograde spread of thrombophlebitis into the dural and cortical veins from infected venous sinuses may occur. The frontal sinus is probably the single most predisposing site of infection; the incidence of subdural empyema following frontal sinusitis is 1% to 2%. Another predisposing cause of subdural empyema is infection and trauma of the head (about 13%). This is followed by otogenic infections (otitis, mastoiditis-about 13%), which may also spread to the subdural space by CT with contrast and MRI scans are the diagnostic studies of choice for subdural empyema. Routine blood tests may reveal an elevated leukocyte count, especially in acute subdural empyema. Lumbar puncture is usually contraindicated because of focal deficits, increased intracranial pressure, and abnormalities on CT or MRI scans. When lumbar puncture is performed, the picture is one of parameningeal inflammatory response with an increased cell count; about 15% of cases have more than 1000 cells per mm 3 . The response is acute with greater than 50% polymorphonuclear leukocytes in about 70% of cases. The glucose level is usually normal and cultures are usually negative (in greater than 90% of cases). The differential diagnosis includes epidural abscess, brain abscess, intracerebral thrombophlebitis, subdural hematoma, meningoencephalitis, pyogenic meningitis (especially after infarction has occurred), herpes simplex encephalitis, cysticercosis, and cerebral neoplasm.",

            "text": "Continued on the next page Acute viral infections of the CNS may cause three syndromes: viral (aseptic) meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. Acute viral meningitis is a self-limited illness, accompanied by fever, headache, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity. Encephalitis implies involvement of the brain parenchyma, causing alteration of consciousness, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. When both meningeal and encephalitic signs are present on examination, the term meningoencephalitis is sometimes used in the diagnosis. Viral myelitis is an infection of the spinal cord. The myelitis is most often considered a demyelinating white matter syndrome (transverse myelitis), but spinal motor neurons (poliomyelitis, paralytic disease), sensory neurons, and autonomic neurons (bladder paralysis) may be affected. If encephalitis and myelitis occur together, the term encephalomyelitis is used. The cerebro-spinal fluid formula in all these viral syndromes is similar, usually showing a mononuclear pleocytosis of 50 to 500 cells per mm 3 , normal glucose level, and elevated protein level and pressure. A clinical continuum exists between viral meningitis and encephalitis, as the same spectrum of viruses cause both syndromes, although some viruses more often cause meningitis and others, encephalitis. The role of mumps virus in the etiology of these syndromes has decreased greatly since the 1970s because of vaccination programs. (Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [32] .) (Continued) Antigen detection usually requires the use of biopsy material. Serologic studies require a fourfold increase between the acute and convalescent specimen to be considered positive. Acute phase sera should be obtained immediately or as soon as infection is suspected. If the acute phase sera is not obtained until the end of the first week of the disease, the chances of seeing a fourfold rise drops to 50%. Most viral infections of the CNS result in the intrathecal synthesis of specific antibody. When analyzing CSF antibody synthesis one looks for an increased CSF to serum antibody ratio. Therefore, paired CSF and serum samples are required. A correction should also be used for blood-brain barrier breakdown, which results in serum to CSF antibody leakage. This can be done by using CSF to serum albumin or other viral antibody ratios. Unfortunately, most antibody studies are not positive until at least 1 week after the onset of infection. The term encephalitis implies involvement of the brain parenchyma. Often the meningeal manifestations seen in acute viral meningitis are also present in addition to the signs of brain dysfunction (meningoencephalitis). The signs of brain dysfunction may be focal or diffuse; these may manifest as mental status changes, seizures (in greater than 50% of cases), or hard focal signs. All types of focal deficits have been reported. Viral encephalitis can be divided into primary and secondary types. In primary encephalitis, there is viral invasion and infection of the brain parenchyma, usually of the gray matter. Secondary encephalitis is postinfectious encephalitis (or encephalomyelitis) in which an immune-mediated attack against myelin and white matter apparently occurs. Despite the different locations (gray vs white matter) of these pathologic insults, one cannot distinguish between the two based on the clinical symptoms and signs. The cerebrospinal fluid profile is similar to that of any acute viral syndrome, with lymphocytic pleocytosis (usually 5 to 500 cells per mm 3 ), normal glucose levels, increased protein levels, and increased pressure. HSV-1 causes a focal encephalitis involving the medial temporal and orbitofrontal lobes. However, at presentation, when the diagnosis needs to be made for institution of therapy, hard focal signs are present only in the minority of patients. The most common manifestations at presentation (alteration in consciousness and personality changes including bizarre behavior and hallucinations) are not very localizing and can be seen in diffuse processes. Localization of the lesion depends upon diagnostic tests. The numbers in parentheses are absolute numbers that represent the number of patients presenting with symptoms or signs divided by the total number of points for which they were asked or for which they looked.

MRI has become the diagnostic test of choice for HSV encephalitis and is abnormal in more than 90% of cases. MRI will usually reveal a hyperintense lesion with T2 weighting due to inflammation and edema within a day or two of onset, even when the CT scan is normal. Lesions may not only be seen in the temporal lobe but also in the orbital frontal lobes and insular cortex. A, T2-weighted axial MRI shows high signal intensity in the right insular cortex, medial right frontal cortex (black arrow), and left w insular cortex (white arrow). w B, T2-weighted coronal image shows increased signal in the left temporal lobe and beginning involvement of the right side. Coronal images are the most useful for seeing the lesion. (A, from A Runge [43] ; with permission; B, from Schroth et al. [44] ; with permission.) (which is not present until at least the second week) and polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid amplifi cation are the most useful diagnostic tests, except for biopsy of the brain. The differential diagnosis includes all causes of encephalitis, both primary and postinfectious. In Australia, the closely related Lyssavirus has caused several cases of fatal encephalitis clinically similar to rabies [48] . Treatable causes such as herpes simplex virus encephalitis are especially important to exclude. Muscular rigidity due to tetanus is also an important differential consideration. Hydrophobia is virtually diagnostic of rabies. In countries where rabies is common, rabies psychosis or hysteria may be seen in those exposed to possibly rabid animals.

Treatment consists of high-dose intravenous steroids (1.0 g methylprednisolone daily for 7 to 10 days) to stop the perivascular demyelination. Plasma exchange and IVIg have also been used for treatment [ 52 ] . Greek words for gray marrow (\"polio\") and spinal cord (\"myelitis\"): \"the gray marrow of the spinal cord.\" Sometimes the term anterior is added as a reminder r that it is the anterior rather than the posterior horns that are infl amed in poliomyelitis. Only about 1% to 2% of those infected with the virus develop paralysis (major illness) with or without the nonspecifi c, systemic, febrile minor illness. Paralysis is usually asymmetric and fl accid, and can occur in all four extremities, as well as in the brain stem, causing bulbar polio with cranial nerve palsies, respiratory insuffi ciency, dysphagia, and coma. The diagnosis of poliomyelitis is based on the clinical paralysis, the cerebrospinal fluid profile picture of an acute viral syndrome, isolation of virus from the throat or stool, and a fourfold rise in the serum antibody level. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of acute lower motor neuron flaccid paralysis. Paralysis is usually asymmetric, without bladder or sensory involvement. Bladder and sensory involvement, however, resulting in a picture of transverse myelitis, has been caused by poliovirus, thus expanding the differential diagnosis to this entity. The only specific treatment for poliomyelitis is prevention with poliovirus vaccine. Both the live attenuated oral vaccine (Sabin type) and the inactive injectable vaccine (Salk type) are used throughout the world. Treatment of the acute disease is supportive. cases occur in the thoracic nerves, the lumbar nerves, and the ophthalmic divisions of the trigeminal nerve (ophthalmic zoster). Approximately 40% to 50% of patients younger than 50 years of age develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is pain persisting for more than 6 weeks after the rash clears. The pain can be severe. PHN can be helped with amitriptyline and carbamazepine; local application of capsaicin may also help. For patients over 50 years of age, the use of oral acyclovir seems prudent in the hope of preventing PHN. Complications of herpes zoster include zoster paresis, myelitis, encephalitis, disseminated disease, and infection of the eye. Secondary to ophthalmic zoster (see Fig. 12 -83B) are keratitis, conjunctivitis, ocular muscle palsies, ptosis, mydriasis, contralateral hemiplegia due to viral spread to the ipsilateral carotid or middle cerebral artery, and the Ramsay Hunt syndrome (geniculate zoster, herpes zoster oticus) with facial palsy, loss of taste, and vesicles in the external auditory meatus. Intravenous acyclovir is indicated for disseminated zoster and probably for most of these complications, although controlled studies of its use for complications have not been reported. A recent study using a highly potent varicella vaccine reduced the incidence of zoster (shingles) by 51% and postherpetic neuralgia by 66.5%. Of those who did developed shingles, the vaccine significantly reduced morbidity [60] . (Adapted from Hope-Simpson [61] .) Subacute measles encephalitis (SME) has also been referred to as \"immunosuppressive measles encephalitis\" and \"measles inclusion body encephalitis\" because of the large number of Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions present. SME occurs most often in children immunosuppressed with chemotherapy for lymphoma or leukemia. A few cases have occurred in adults. The incubation period is less than 6 months from the time of measles exposure. Clinical manifestations are seizures, hemiparesis, retinitis, and cortical blindness followed by coma and death in weeks to months. There is no treatment. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually normal except for increased measles antibody titers. The electroencephalogram (EEG) may reveal focal slowing but no periodic complexes. Because of the immunosuppressed state, a large load of virus appears to reach the CNS.",

Myoclonus and seizures are less prominent than in SSPE, but cerebellar ataxia is more prominent. The course is protracted over 8 to 10 years to death. There is no treatment. High levels of rubella antibody appear in the serum and CSF. Both CSF protein and IgG are increased, oligoclonal bands are present, and some patients have CSF pleocytosis (10 to 40 monocytes/mm 3 ).

One is the chronic vacuolar myelopathy that results in corticospinal tract and posterior column sensory signs (vibration and position sense loss). It needs to be distinguished from secondary human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1-associated CMV polyradiculitis is the primary differential diagnosis. An HIV myopathy may also be seen but is infrequent; a myopathy secondary to zidovudine therapy is more likely. ARC-AIDS-related complex. (Adapted from Johnson et al. [62] .) [66] . Both CD4 + cell and HIV RNA levels are used to decide when to start and change therapy [66] . Triple combination therapies with RTIs and a PI or an NNRTI have been referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy [66] . When prescribing anti-HIV therapy, it is important to know the interactions between these agents as well as the interactions between these agents and other medication classes (antihistamines, antifungals, antimycobacterials, oral contraceptives, cytochrome P450 metabolized drugs, benzodiazepines, antibiotics, methadone, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, and ergot alkaloids). Symptomatic treatment such as antidepressants or antipsychotics for HIV encephalopathy may be useful. For the painful sensory neuropathy, analgesics, antidepressants (especially tricyclics), anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin), and topical capsaicin ointment may be helpful. GI-gastrointestinal. Patients may have paresthesia and pain in the legs. Both posterior column and spinothalamic sensory loss have been seen but usually in a minority of cases. Infrequently, cranial nerve (CN) signs are seen, with optic atrophy the most common. Other CN signs include nystagmus, diplopia, deafness, and facial paresis. Antibodies to HTLV-1 have been found in 80% to 100% of cases, and HTLV-1 has been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. The pathogenesis appears more likely to be an immune-mediated process, as cytotoxic T lymphocytes rather than HTLV-1 viral titer levels are related to the demyelinating lesions. Pathologic changes include inflammation of the leptomeninges, perivascular cuffing, and inflammation of the cord parenchyma. Symmetrical demyelination of the corticospinal tracts occurs, and to a lesser degree and frequency, demyelination of the posterior columns and spinothalamic and spinocerebellar tracts. Much less frequently, patients with HTLV-1 infections have presented with an ALS-like picture, polyneuropathy, and inflammatory and noninflammatory myopathies [67] . Most cases of HAM/TSP occur in warm areas along the equator, where the virus is endemic. Isolated cases have occurred in more northern and southern latitudes, including northern areas of the United States. The disease usually begins in the third or fourth decade and women are more commonly When the lesions become extensive throughout the white matter, mental status changes ensue. PML occurs in immunosuppressed individuals. Before the AIDS epidemic, it was seen most often in those treated for lymphoproliferative disease (leukemia/lymphoma). PML is much more common in AIDS patients with a prevalence of about 2.5%. Recently, PML was reported in two multiple sclerosis patients enrolled in a clinical trial who received combination therapy of natalizumab and interferon--1a [70] . The disease progresses to death in months. There is no specific treatment. Diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). T2-weighted axial MRI scan, with increased signal intensity in the left frontal lobe and corona radiata with extension across the midline in a patient with PML. As is characteristic, the subcortical U-fibers are involved. No specific findings occur in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is usually normal. The electroencephalographic changes are nonspecific. Serologic testing is not helpful, as most adults already have antibody to JC virus. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of JC viral DNA from the CSF is positive in about 80% of patients with PML. CT scans reveal low-density nonenhancing lesions without mass effect. MRI scans reveal increased signal intensity of T2-weighted, FLAIR, or diffusion-weighted images; enhancement is minimal in 10% to 15% of cases. Biopsy of the brain may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. (From Whiteman et al. [71] ; with permission.) . SSPE has become a rare disease in the United States, with fewer than 10 cases per year, since the introduction of measles vaccine. Most patients had their measles infection prior to the age of 2 years, followed by a latent period before the onset of disease, which occurs between the ages of 5 to 15 years in 85% of patients. The disease usually begins with poor school performance, personality changes and then dementia (forgetfulness, regressive speech), which is referred to as stage I. Myoclonus, seizures, and movement disorders occur in stage II. Eventually the comatose and akinetic mutism stages ensue. Death usually occurs in 1 to 3 years, but has ranged from several months to 15 years. SSPE apparently is caused by the lack of production of the measles virus M protein, which is needed by the virus to bud out of the cell and spread efficiently to the next cell. This results in a cell-associated infection. The measles virus can spread only by cell fusion, which is slow and inefficient. Diagnosis is made from clinical manifestations and the characteristic laboratory abnormalities. One of the most characteristic laboratory tests is the electroencephalogram, which reveals periodic patterns of bursts occurring every 5 to 7 seconds followed by periods of background attenuation (burst-suppression). The cerebrospinal fluid gamma globulin and measles antibody titers are usually elevated. CT and MRI performed late in the course reveal diffuse atrophy of the cortex and white matter, with ex vacuo ventricular enlargement. MRI usually reveals multifocal gray and white matter lesions. Although there is no specific treatment, intrathecal administration of interferon-with oral inosiplex has resulted in remissions. SSPE can be prevented with measles vaccination [72] .

            "text": "Prolonged incubation period of months to years Figure 12 -100. Characteristics of the prion diseases and agents. One of the important characteristics of these agents is that they do not contain detectable nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) but do contain a protein, the prion protein (PrP), that must be transmitted for disease to occur. This finding led to the \"prion\" terminology, which was derived from \"protein\" and \"infectious.\" There is no specific treatment for the various prion diseases. However, the agent (prions) can be disinfected with various sterilization procedures. Other gray matter areas such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum may also be involved. Spongiform change can also be due to the development of vacuoles in the neurons more than in the astrocytes. This would result in an overall loss of neurons. As previously noted, the prion protein (PrP) is associated with the transmission of disease. It is a hydrophobic protein with a molecular weight of 27 to 30 kD, referred to as PrP Sc 27-30. Scrapie (Sc) is the prototype prion disease that has been analyzed in these studies. PrP Sc 27-30 is the protease-resistant component of a larger protein, PrP Sc 33-35. Subsequently, it was found that uninfected brains also contained a similar protein, PrP C 33-35, which in humans has its gene (PRNP) on the short arm of chromosome 20. PrP C 33-35 is fully degraded but PrP Sc 33-35 is only degraded to PrP Sc 27-30, which collapses to produce amyloid deposition. On electron micrographs \"prion rods\" (or \"scrapie-associated fibrils\") may be seen. PrP C is found on the cell surface and has two transmembrane domains, while PrP Sc accumulates within cells and extracellularly. The role of PrP C is unknown. These findings have led to the hypothesis that in infected animals, PrP C undergoes posttranslational modification being converted to the PrP Sc isoform. This posttranslational modification would be the explanation for the sporadic prion diseases (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD]). Prion disease can also be infectious (kuru, accidental CJD), or genetic (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler syndrome, fatal familial insomnia). Kuru is infectious and is transmitted most often during cannibalistic rituals. CJD has been transmitted by surgical instruments, stereotactic electroencephalogram needles, growth hormone preparations, dura matter grafts, and corneal transplants. In the genetic cases there are mutations in the PRNP gene. How the agent actually repli P cates in the sporadic and infectious cases is unclear. Pathologic changes are similar in all prion diseases with varying degrees of each feature. These features include spongiform change, astrocytosis, and deposition of amyloid or kuru plaques. (From Hirano et al. [41] ; with permission.) Usually there is a gradual onset of dementia in middle or late life. Prodromal symptoms may include anxiety, dizziness, blurred vision, unusual behavior, poor judgment, and fatigue. In addition to dementia, cerebellar signs often occur early and involuntary movements (especially myoclonus) and corticospinal tract and extrapyramidal signs eventually become prominent. Socalled variant types, for example, lower motor neuron type and occipital type, have been categorized when these features are prominent early in the course. The incidence of CJD is 1 case per 1 million people per year and is the same throughout the world except for a few areas of high incidence (Libya, North Africa, Slovakia). CJD is not contagious but is transmissible, and general trauma, head and neck trauma, and head and neck surgery predispose a patient to the disease. Five percent to 15% of cases are familial, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Mutations have been found in the PRNP gene in some of P these familial cases and most often occur at codons 178 and 200. In a recent series the range for the age of onset was 16 to 82 years but only one patient was younger than 30 years old and four were younger than 40 years old. The mean duration of disease was 8 months; 80% to 90% die in 1 year. As previously noted, CJD is not contagious but the mode of transmission is unknown. The agent is not found in saliva or stool and . Routine blood studies are normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also usually normal although the protein may be increased. Two dimensional isoelectric focusing of CSF proteins have revealed two abnormal protein species, now referred to as 14-3-3 neuronal proteins. The assay is positive in about 85% of sporadic CJD CSF samples. The assay may also be positive in other diseases with acute massive neuronal destruction such as herpes simplex encephalitis and acute infarction. MRI may be of equal sensitivity to the 14-3-3 assay for diagnostic purposes (see Fig. 12-104 ). The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the diagnostic test of choice. Various series report 60% to 95% of patients will have periodic complexes occurring on the average of one per second (range 0.5 to 2.5 seconds). Serial EEG may be needed to detect the periodicity, as it is usually absent at onset and early in the course and may also be absent late in the course. Diagnosis can also be made from brain biopsy but usually is not required. This electroencephalogram from a 65-year-old man with CJD shows periodic spikes or sharp waves every 0.7 seconds. (Adapted from Jubelt [76] .) only very rarely in urine. Therefore, it does not seem necessary to isolate patients. Because the agent is present in internal organs, blood and cerebrospinal fluid serum hepatitis precautions should be taken. (Adapted from Brown et al. [75] .) Figure 12 -104. MRI of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Increased signal intensity may be seen on T2-weighted, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Two patterns may be seen. The first is a diffuse pattern primarily seen in the basal ganglia and occasionally in the thalamus. The second is a cortical ribbon or gyriform pattern in the cortex and cerebellum. DWI appears to be more sensitive than either FLAIR or T2 imaging, with 90% to 100% sensitivity compared with about 50%. Three patterns of high intensity lesions were seen on DWI: . vCJD occurs at a younger age than classic CJD, with 89% dying before the age of 40. The duration of vCJD is also longer, with a median duration of illness of 14 months as compared to 9 to 11 months for classic CJD. vCJD usually begins with psychiatric symptoms and painful sensory symptoms rather than memory loss. Similar to classic CJD, dementia, ataxia, and involuntary movements eventually occur (see Fig. 12-102) . Another unusual feature of vCJD is that the typical periodic triphasic complexes seen on electroencephalograms from classic CJD patients has not been reported. MRI may reveal abnormalities in the thalamus, but this finding is not specific for vCJD. (Adapted from Will et al. [78] .) . GSS is an autosomal dominant familial disease. Clinically, patients appear to have spinocerebellar degeneration or olivopontocerebellar degeneration with cerebellar ataxia, which is the first most severe manifestation of the disease. Myoclonus is much less common. Eventually dementia and parkinsonism develop in most patients. The electroencephalogram does not usually show periodicity. In one reported case, early in the course, diffusion-weighted MRI revealed a cortical gyriform pattern in the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, followed by atrophy late in the course. ",

It is a chronic meningitis, but in AIDS patients it may progress even more slowly and present only with fever and headache instead of the usual manifestations of meningeal signs, mental status changes, and cranial nerve palsies. The usual cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile in cryptococcal meningitis, as well as most causes of fungal meningitis, is that of mononuclear (lymphocytic) pleocytosis, a low glucose level, and an elevated protein level. AIDS patients, however, often do not fit this typical CSF picture. Most striking is the fact that 65% of AIDS patients have a normal CSF cell count of fewer than 5 cells/mm 3 . Diagnosis is confirmed by positive CSF culture result or a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test. Polymerase chain reaction techniques are in development but appear to be more sensitive than culture. (Adapted from Tunkel and Scheld [84] .) The clinical features of \"cocci\" meningitis are similar to those of cryptococcal meningitis except that changes in the patient's mental state are more likely to occur because of the earlier development of hydrocephalus. Other manifestations include fever, headache, and meningismus. Coccidioides is a common cause of fungal meningitis in areas where it is endemic. Fortunately, it is endemic only in the San Joaquin Valley and the desert areas of Central California. (From Galgiani [85] ; with permission.) ",

Symptomatic meningeal syphilis usually occurs during the first 2 years after the primary infection. In approximately 10% of cases, syphilitic meningitis occurs with the rash of secondary syphilis, but most cases occur during the tertiary stage. Patients present with headache, meningismus, and malaise. They may or may not have a low-grade fever. Lymphocytic pleocytosis of up to several hundred cells occurs; the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level is reduced, but usually is greater than 25 mg/dL; CSF protein level is increased and may exceed 100 mg/dL; and the CSF pressure may be elevated. This syndrome is diagnosed with positive blood and CSF serologic tests (serologic tests for syphilis: Venereal Disease Research Laboratories, rapid plasma reagin). The syndrome may resolve on its own, or complications may ensue. Because the meningitis is most concentrated at the base, cranial nerve palsies are often seen, sometimes bilaterally but usually asymmetrically. Obstruction of CSF pathways may result in subacute to chronic hydrocephalus. (Adapted from Merrit et al. [90] .) Pathologic specimen from a brain with paretic neurosyphilis. Paretic neurosyphilis has also been referred to as general paresis of the insane, syphilitic meningoencephalitis, dementia paralytica, and syphilitic dementia. Symptoms usually begin 5 to 15 years after the primary infection, with a range of 3 to 30 years. Paretic neurosyphilis was common in the preantibiotic era but is now infrequent. The symptoms and signs of general paresis are similar to any organic brain syndrome. Progressive dementia with personality changes is the most common feature. Behavioral changes with psychosis and grandiose delusional states are unusual. Seizures also are seen. Masked facies; tremors of the face, tongue, lips, and extremities; dysarthria; and hyperactive reflexes may also occur. Pathologically there is chronic meningoencephalitis with cortical atrophy, enlarged ventricles, thickened meninges, and granular ependymitis. Microscopic lesions include mononuclear inflammatory cells, a prominent microglial rod cell response, and the presence of the organisms. Diagnosis depends on cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities and serologic results. Usually patients are younger (less than 50 years of age) than those with other causes of dementia. Penicillin is an effective therapy and usually arrests the progression of the dementia but will not reverse the existing damage. (From Merrit et al. [90] ; with permission.) Beginning in the 1980s and coincident with the AIDS epidemic, this trend has been reversed. The incidence of neurosyphilis is unknown, but the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis has risen from 13.7 per 100,000 population in 1981 to a peak of 20.1 per 100,000 in 1990. Since then the incidence has dropped significantly, perhaps because of better surveillance and education. The overall frequency of neurosyphilis in HIV-positive and AIDS patients is estimated to be 2%. Also during the 1980s and 1990s, a shift occurred toward meningeal and vascular forms of neurosyphilis and a decline in the parenchymal forms. This may be related to cerebrospinal fluid abnormali- For this reason, Lyme disease has been divided into stages. The nervous system is involved clinically in 10% to 15% of patients. Stage I, the acute stage, is characterized by a rash-erythema chronicum migrans (ECM)-which is an erythematous ring that develops around the tick bite site about 8 to 9 (range 3 to 32) days after exposure. Smaller secondary (migratory) rings may occur later. Neurologic manifestations may occur in stage I concurrently with ECM, but they are more frequent in stage II. Stage II, the subacute stage, is characterized by prominent cardiac and neurologic manifestations. This stage usually begins several months after the bite and the onset of ECM. Stage III, the chronic stage, is characterized by chronic arthritis. Neurologic manifestations also occur in stage III but they are less prominent than those of stage II. Stage III usually begins about 1 year after onset.",

The organism does not cause a systemic infection but invades the brain through olfactory nerves. (From Durack [107] ; with permission.) Figure 12 -152. Clinical manifestations of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Acute PAM caused by Naegleria presents as acute meningoencephalitis after an incubation period of several days to a week. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile is similar to that of acute bacterial meningitis, with several hundred to thousand leukocytes, primarily polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and a low glucose level. Amebae may be seen on wet preparations or with Wright or Giemsa stains. The organisms can be cultured on special media or isolated by mouse inoculation. A serologic test is available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is rapidly fatal. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice. Subacute or chronic PAM (including granulomatous amebic encephalitis) presents more gradually, similar to a brain abscess or tumor. The CSF pleocytosis is more often lymphocytic, with a normal or only slightly decreased glucose level. Amebae can be found in the CSF only occasionally. Neuroimaging reveals focal lesions; biopsy is usually required for diagnosis. This disease is usually fatal. In vitro the organism is usually sensitive to pentamidine, ketoconazole, and flucytosine. The small eggs of this organism are able to reach the brain; ectopic worms have been found in cerebral veins. S. mansoni and i S. haematobium, residing in the inferior mesenteric veins and vesical plexus, respectively, have larger eggs that most commonly affect the spinal cord. This CNS involvement occurs less frequently than that seen with S. japonicum. Neurologic disease has not been well characterized for S. mekongi and i S. intercalatum. (Adapted from Maguire [108] .) The presentation of the chronic cerebral form is similar to a tumor, with focal deficits, seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and papilledema. The spinal cord disease is almost always acute, presenting as incomplete transverse myelitis. There is a peripheral leukocytosis with eosinophilia except in the chronic cerebral form. The cerebrospinal fluid shows slight to moderate pleocytosis, sometimes with eosinophilia. Cerebral lesions may be seen with CT or MRI; spinal lesions are seen with MRI or myelography. Diagnosis can be made by finding ova in the stool or urine, by using serologic tests, and rectal mucosal biopsy. There are usually no symptoms at this stage. The terminal gravid proglottids of the worm are excreted in the feces with thousands of ova. These ova contaminate the environment, where they are ingested by pigs or humans (intermediate hosts). The shells of these eggs are digested by gastric juices, liberating the embryos (oncospheres), which penetrate the intestinal wall, migrate to tissues, and become encysted (cysticerci). In humans they primarily localize to the brain and CNS. Cysticercosis is clearly the most important cestode infection of humans. Coenurosis is the rare larval disease caused by the dog tapeworm, Taenia (Multiceps) multiceps. (Adapted from Johnson and Warren [99] .) The diagnosis of cysticercosis should be considered in patients who reside in endemic areas (see Fig. 12 -157) and have seizures, meningitis, or papilledema (increased intracranial pressure). CT and MRI are especially useful, as they may demonstrate live parenchymal cysts with enhancement (diffuse or ring pattern), calcified dead cysts, hydrocephalus, and intraventricular and subarachnoid cysts with enhancement. Usually the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows mild pleocytosis, but may be normal or show severe pleocytosis due to meningitis when subarachnoid or intraventricular cysts die. There may be up to several thousand leukocytes (usually mononuclear), a low glucose level, and an elevated protein level. CSF and serum antibody tests are usually positive (80% to 98% sensitivity depending on the test). (From Cameron and Durak [110] ; with permission.) CT scan of a patient with a hydatid cyst of the brain. CT and MRI scans localize the lesions, which are usually single, nonenhancing, and have the density of cerebrospinal fluid. Needle biopsy is usually precluded because of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, caused by cyst rupture. Additional cysts may be found in the lungs and liver. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody test has a 95% sensitivity. Surgical removal of cysts is the preferred treatment. Drug treatment with albendazole may decrease the size of the cysts, but it should be started before surgery to prevent allergic reactions and secondary hydatidosis at the time of surgery.

For individuals at high risk (rabies laboratory workers, some veterinarians, animal control and wildlife workers in endemic areas, and spelunkers and travelers to highly endemic areas in which exposure could occur), pre-exposure prophylaxis should be used. Postexposure prophylaxis includes local wound care, passive immunization with rabies antiserum, and active immunization with rabies vaccine. Both the antiserum and the vaccine should be started immediately. To avoid the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, vaccine and antisera should not be given in the same inoculation or even inoculated into the same geographic site. If human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) is not available, equine antirabies serum can be used, but serum sickness may result. The three rabies vaccines (human diploid cell vaccine [HDCV], rabies vaccine absorbed, and purifi ed chick embryo cell) are equally effective and safe; severe reactions are rare. There have been three cases of recovery from rabies; these patients were treated ineffectively with pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis with the older nonhuman rabies animal vaccines before the onset of clinical disease. Rabies postexposure prophylaxis with HRIG and HDCV (or rabies vaccine) has been 100% effective in the United States. Case reports of failure from outside the United States may relate to the use of inappropriate inoculation sites and failure to treat the wound adequately.

PIE is secondary encephalitis in which an immune-mediated attack appears to be mounted against central myelin. At times the spinal cord is also involved, causing encephalomyelitis. Presumably virus does not need to invade the central nervous system to cause the syndrome, as the immune system can become sensitized to myelin peripherally by sequence homology between viral proteins and myelin proteins. The common causes of PIE are chickenpox (varicella), mumps, and nonspecifi c upper respiratory infections. Usually this syndrome begins 3 days to 3 weeks after onset of the preceding infection. PIE occurs in cerebral and cerebellar forms. Clinically the cerebral form looks like primary encephalitis (seeFig. 12-57). The acute cerebellar ataxic form is the type most often caused by chickenpox and has a good prognosis. Between 100 to 200 cases are reported annually in the United States.

Diagnosis is relatively easy because of the classic clinical manifestations, with positive serologic results, at least in the blood samples. The disease may arrest spontaneously or may be arrested with antibiotic treatment. The latter is more likely to occur when there are signs of active inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Even after treatment, and even when there is no active CSF inflammation (as regards CSF pleocytosis), many of the manifestations may continue to progress. The pathogenesis of tabes is not understood. In contrast to paretic cortical lesions, spirochetes are not found in the affected areas of the spinal cord, which may explain why antibiotic therapy may not stop progression.

Congenital toxoplasmosis is a systemic illness causing chorioretinitis, microencephaly, seizures, mental retardation (from encephalitis), and cerebral calcifications in newborns. Cases in immunocompromised patients are frequent, thus, toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients that usually occurs because of reactivation. (Adapted from Luft and Remington [100].)Figure 12-140. Transmission of toxoplasmosis. Most often Toxoplasma gondii infection occurs by eating undercooked meat or other foods contaminated with cat feces containing oocysts. Common-source outbreaks have occurred in families from contaminated food. Unpasteurized milk and water are also possible sources of infection. In addition to exposure to cats and eating undercooked meats, warm humid climates and poor sanitation correlate with a greater prevalence of infection. Primary infection in the immunocompetent host is usually asymptomatic. Rarely, symptomatic severe primary infection occurs. Usually tissue cysts persist and reactivation is prevented unless immunity wanes, as occurs in AIDS or other immunosuppressive events (such as therapy for cancer and transplantation).

Enhanced axial CT of toxoplasmosis in an AIDS patient showing multiple ring and nodular enhancing lesions.The complete blood count may reveal anemia, leukopenia, or leukocytosis in congenital toxoplasmosis. In most AIDS patients, disease is limited to the brain. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is abnormal in about half the patients with congenital toxoplasmosis and in most patients with AIDS. Lymphocytic pleocytosis is usually mild but may be as high as several thousand cells/mm 3 . The protein level is increased and the glucose level is usually normal or rarely mildly reduced. Isolation of the organism is difficult, as it requires inoculation of laboratory mice; therefore, a presumptive diagnosis can be made based on serologic tests in the appropriate clinical setting. The demonstration of IgM antibodies is most helpful for the diagnosis of congenital or acute acquired infection. In AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients, IgG, but not IgM, antibody is usually present. CSF antibodies may also be detected. Other than serologic testing, neuroimaging is the diagnostic study of choice. In congenital toxoplasmosis the skull radiograph may reveal multiple intracerebral calcifications.

Parasitized erythrocytes are less deformable than normal erythrocytes and more adherent to vascular endothelial cells. Thrombotic occlusions, microinfarctions, microhemorrhages, and cerebral edema result. Large infarctions and hemorrhage are unusual.Malaria is the most common human parasitic disease in the world. In 2002, there were about 515 million people in the world infected with malaria, 70% in Africa and 25% in Southeast Asia. The yearly death rate is 2 million. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Nervous system involvement occurs in about 2% of infected patients. Cerebral malaria is caused only by Plasmodium falciparum.

Comparison of West African and East African trypanosomiasis. There are two varieties of human trypanosomiasis, an African form (sleeping sickness) and a South American form (Chagas disease), which is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The African disease is of two types. The West African form is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and the East African variety by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The East African disease is more acute, leading to death in weeks to months. CNS-central nervous system.

The signs and symptoms of West and East African trypanosomiasis are basically the same, except that the East African form has a more acute course of weeks to months while the West African form has a more chronic course of months to years.

Many species of trematodes can infect humans, although schistosomiasis and paragonimiasis are the most common. With the exception of some schistosomes, most trematodes have wild or domestic animals as definitive hosts, with humans infected accidentally. Eosinophilia is common during acute trematode infections. Paragonimus are lung flukes, the lungs being the final habitat. Acute purulent (meningoencephalitic) forms, chronic granulomatous (tumorous) forms, and late inactive forms are seen. In the acute meningoencephalitic form, there is fever, headache, seizures, hemiparesis and other focal deficits, and confusion. The cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis consists of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the acute form and lymphocytes in the chronic form. Eosinophils occasionally appear in the cerebrospinal fluid. Serologic tests are generally available. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding ova in the stool or sputum or by biopsy.CT may reveal \"soap bubble\" calcifications. The acute form has a 10% mortality rate; the chronic form is benign. The acute form is treated with praziquantel or bithionol; the chronic form, with surgery.

For symptomatic patients, both praziquantel and albendazole are effective. Because dying cysticerci provoke a severe inflammatory reaction with edema, corticosteroids should be used concomitantly.
