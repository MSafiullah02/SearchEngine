In fact, 90% of outbreaks previously of unknown cause are noroviruses. 2 In addition to human costs, economic losses in supplies, closed beds, and staff time off is thought to exceed $650,000 in the United States annually. 4 New variant strains of norovirus seem to have emerged recently across the world through mutation, much like influenza viruses. These norovirus strains have been associated with an increase in the number of annual outbreaks. In 2002, a genetic shift in circulating strains was noted with the emergence of the GII.4-2002 variant strain. 5 Subsequently, not only was activity higher in the spring but also an unusually high number of outbreaks occurred in the winter season 2002-2003 worldwide. 5 This type of pattern repeated in 2004 with the GII.4-2004 strain and again in 2006 with the GII.4-2006a and GII.4-2006b strains. 5 Researchers examined the trends in morbidity and mortality based on these gastroenteritis outbreaks in the elderly. Many episodes of gastroenteritis do not result in laboratory testing, so in addition to laboratory surveillance and norovirus outbreak surveillance, they investigated unspecified gastroenteritis in general practitioner office visits and hospital visits, and unspecified gastroenteritis as a primary or secondary cause of death. The trends identified in their research supported their hypothesis that norovirus epidemics are associated with morbidity and mortality in the elderly in Netherlands. These trends may be influenced by the evolution of viruses, and indicate that gastroenteritis should not be taken lightly in the elder population. 5 Sapovirus is spread similar to norovirus and primarily affects children younger than 5 years. However, it has been found to be spread by asymptomatic adults. It has been spread from infected asymptomatic adult health care workers to elderly patients. 2 Astrovirus is spread through the fecal-oral route but is uncommon in the adult population, although it has been seen in nosocomial and epidemic diarrhea. 2 Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children and affects adults much less frequently. However, approximately one-third of parents of infected Viral Gastroenteritis in the Adult Population children also become infected with rotavirus. 2 Rotavirus outbreaks have occurred in nursing home settings and from contaminated food and water.",

Hypovolemia occurs when the extracellular fluid volume is reduced, leading to a shift in intravascular volume, and when severe can cause reduction in tissue perfusion. If significant salt and water loss occurring through diarrhea and vomiting is not replaced, the patient becomes hypovolemic. Thus, patients with severe viral gastroenteritis with a fever, profuse diarrhea, and minimal fluid intake can present with volume depletion evidenced by poor skin turgor, tachycardia, orthostatic changes, and elevated plasma sodium concentration.

Oral rehydration was the focus of a study by Rao and colleagues 9 examining the efficacy, safety, and palatability of Pedialyte, Gatorade, and a New Oral Rehydration Solution (N-ORS) in an adult population with mild to moderate viral gastroenteritis. This randomized double-blind trial took place in a hospital setting, where they measured stool and urine output, fluid intake, body weight, electrolytes, hematocrit, and palatability. The results showed improved stool frequency, consistency, and body weight in all 3 groups, without differences among groups. All other parameters were similar. Subjects with normal electrolytes on admission were able to maintain them throughout the study, but those with hypokalemia or hyponatremia in the Gatorade group were less likely to correct this imbalance. 9 The authors state that this may be a skewed result because the Gatorade group had a higher percentage of hyponatremic and hypokalemic subjects than the other groups. The subjects preferred the taste of the Gatorade and the N-ORS versus the Pedialyte. The authors discuss the importance of this finding, because a sport drink such as Gatorade tends to be relatively less expensive, available in most convenience stores, and well tolerated by the public. Therefore, Gatorade may be effective in helping to treat dehydration associated with mild viral gastroenteritis. Diluted fruit juices and flavored soda drinks with saltine crackers and broth or soup may help rehydrate those who are less severely ill.",

They may benefit from a fluid challenge over 1 to 2 hours, and then carefully reassessed through monitoring urine output, blood pressure, heart rate, and mental status. In patients with severe hypovolemia and organ dysfunction, rapid fluid replacement at 200 to 300 mL/h for short periods with frequent reassessments is recommended. The most critically ill patients who develop severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome may benefit from additional close monitoring of central venous pressure and pulmonary central wedge pressure.

They used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) as a nationally representative database of hospital inpatient stays in the United States. They attempted to estimate the proportion of cause-unspecified gastroenteritis codes that were due to norovirus using indirect approaches. They determined that the rate of causeunspecified gastroenteritis increased by 41% from 1996 to 1997 to 2006 through 2007. Results across age groups revealed a decrease in rates for children but increased by more than 50% for adults and the elderly. 10 Estimates of norovirus-associated hospitalizations and rotavirus-associated activity in nonpediatric age groups increased over the study period. 10 This study highlights the high number of cause-unspecified gastroenteritis and the need for increased diagnostic testing in emergency, inpatient, and LTCF settings.

Schwartz and colleagues 11 describes an outbreak of norovirus genotype II.4 variant strain in a hematologic and transplantation hospital unit that started from 1 patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 7 months prior. Stool samples were negative for bacteria and parasites, and the cause of gastrointestinal symptoms was originally thought to be intestinal graft-versus-host disease. Within 6 days of admission, 4 other patients developed vomiting and diarrhea, which prompted laboratory screening for norovirus. In total, 11 patients and 11 staff members contracted norovirus; an attack rate of 3.3% for patients and 10.5% for staff members, which is considered much lower than previously reported rates exceeding 50%. Isolation precautions were followed immediately after norovirus was identified, which may have decreased the attack rate. Staff members were dismissed and did not return to work for 48 hours after symptoms ceased. Stool samples remained positive for norovirus RNA for a median of 30 days, but no transmission was observed after the 48-hour asymptomatic interval. 11 Histo-blood groups and secretor status typing were examined and all 11 infected patients were secretor-positive phenotype; 3 of these patients died. 11 The authors stress the importance of meticulous measures to prevent the transmission of norovirus gastroenteritis to this vulnerable population.",

Braham and colleagues 14 examined a panel of samples from outbreaks of gastroenteritis that had no identified cause and applied random amplification molecular methods. Virus purification and concentration followed by a single-primer sequence-independent amplification method identified viruses in 5 of 51 previously negative outbreaks. Noroviruses were detected in 4 of these outbreaks that were not identified using 2 available broadly reactive diagnostic methods. 14 This study highlights the potential for future methods of early detection.",

It is known that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) help determine host susceptibility for norovirus infection, and individuals with blood type B or AB are less susceptible to norovirus infections. Additionally, Northern Europeans and Americans from Northern European ancestors lack the fucosyl-transferase 2 enzyme and do not express the H type 1 or Lewis b antigens on their mucosae or in secretions. 15 Reeck and colleagues 15 developed an HBGA blocking assay and wanted to examine the ability of human serum to block interaction of norovirus virus-like particles with H type 1 and 3 glycans. Volunteers were inoculated with norovirus and evaluated. Infected individuals had a peak in blocking titers at 28 days after challenge, and these were higher than in those who developed gastroenteritis. 15 They concluded that blocking antibodies correlate with protection against clinical norovirus gastroenteritis. 15 This information can be used in the development of new vaccines.",
