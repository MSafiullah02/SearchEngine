            "text": "Moderate to heavy exercise workloads have contrasting influences on immune function. Moderate exercise training has been associated with favorable perturbations in immunity and a reduction in incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). More research is needed to establish whether or not a link exists between moderate exercise-induced perturbations in immunity and improvements in other clinical outcomes such as cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and aging. Epidemiological data indicate that endurance athletes are at increased URTI risk during periods of heavy training and the 1\u20132 week period following race events. For several hours subsequent to heavy exertion, components of both the innate (e.g., natural killer cell activity and neutrophil oxidative burst activity) and adaptive (e.g., T- and B-cell function) immune system exhibit suppressed function. Some attempts have been made through nutritional means (e.g., glutamine, vitamins C and E, and carbohydrate supplementation) to attenuate immune changes following intensive exercise and thus lower URTI risk. Carbohydrate supplementation during heavy exercise has emerged as the most effective countermeasure, and attenuates increases in blood neutrophil counts, stress hormones, and inflammatory cytokines.",

More research is needed to determine if immune alterations during exercise training help explain the lowered risk of chronic disease. For example, although epidemiological and experimental studies with animal models suggest that physical activity may protect against several forms of cancer, evidence linking this to enhanced immunity is limited and controversial (Fairey et al., 2005). Hoffman-Goetz and Husted (1995) more than a decade ago proposed that although various exercise-induced mechanical and hormonal changes best explain the relationship to reduced risk of colon, breast, and prostate cancer in physically active individuals, several potential immunological effects may be contributing factors. These include exercise-induced immune modulation of cytokines; activation and changes in signal transduction of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; changes in the expression of cell adhesion molecules; and alterations in prostaglandins. Accumulating evidence indicates that exercise training causes changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and activity that may influence both the prevention and treatment of certain types of carcinomas (Allgayer et al., 2004). This area of research endeavor is highly complex, and more research is needed.",

            "text": "Immune senescence or age-associated immune deficiency appears to be partly responsible for the afflictions of old age. Elderly persons are more susceptible to many infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancers when compared with younger adults. A new and growing area of research endeavor is the study of the relationship between physical activity and immune senescence. One study of adults over the age of 65 years showed that a 10-month exercise program enhanced the antibody titer response to an influenza immunization (Kohut et al., 2004), thus showing that exercise can have some immediate benefits for the elderly. Regular physical activity may also attenuate the age-related decrease in T lymphocyte function (Smith et al., 2004). Very few studies have been conducted in this area, but the available data taken together suggest that exercise training may need to be long term and of sufficient volume to induce changes in body weight and fitness before any change in immunity can be expected in old age (Kohut and Senchina, 2004; Nieman et al., 1993). In other words, because the aging process is so dominant in old age, long-term physical activity combined with leanness and other positive lifestyle habits may be necessary before immune function is enhanced.",

            "text": "Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. During exercise, IL-6 is produced by muscle fibers and stimulates the appearance in the circulation of other anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ra and IL-10 (Petersen and Pedersen, 2005). IL-6 also inhibits the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and stimulates lipolysis and fat oxidation. With weight loss from energy restriction and exercise, plasma levels of IL-6 fall, skeletal muscle TNF-alpha decreases, and insulin sensitivity improves (Ferrier et al., 2004; Ryan and Nicklas, 2004). Thus, IL-6 release from the exercising muscle may help mediate some of the health benefits of exercise including metabolic control of type 2 diabetes (Petersen and Pedersen, 2005). The exercise-induced cytokine links between adipose and muscle tissues clearly warrant further study (Tomas et al., 2004).",

Research data on the resting immunity of athletes and non-athletes, however, are limited and present a confusing picture at present (Nieman, 1997b). For example, the few studies available suggest that the innate immune system responds differentially to the chronic stress of intensive exercise, with natural killer cell activity tending to be enhanced while neutrophil function is suppressed (Nieman et al., 1995b, 1999; Pyne et al., 1995; Smith and Pyne, 1997).

In one study, salivary IgA secretion rate decreased by nearly half in a group of 155 ultramarathon runners following a 160 km race (Nieman et al., 2006). Nearly one in four runners reported an URTI episode during the 2-week period following the race, and the decrease in sIgA secretion rate was significantly greater in these runners (54%) compared to those not reporting URTI (31%). It is doubtful, however, that sIgA output alone can be used to predict URTI at the individual athlete level. In this study, the overall predictive value for URTI was 55%, indicating that sIgA output was more useful at the group compared to the individual level, and that other factors need to be discovered and combined with sIgA before URTI risk can be predicted for individual athletes.",

The epidemiological studies summarized in Table 1 all used self-reported URTI data (primarily retrospective, with two studies using 1-year daily logs). None have attempted to verify symptomatology using viral identification or verification by physicians. There is some concern that the symptoms reported by endurance athletes following competitive race events may reflect those associated with an inflammatory response rather than URTI (Castell et al., 1997; Drenth et al., 1995; Nehlsen-Cannarella et al., 1997).

During the week following the race, 12.9% of the marathoners reported an URTI compared to only 2.2% of control runners who did not participate (odds ratio, 5.9, using a logistic regression model that controlled for various training and demographic variables). Forty percent of the runners reported at least one URTI episode during the 2-month winter period prior to the marathon race.

URTI incidence was also measured during the 2 winter-month period prior to the three races, and in this group of recreational runners, 25% of those running 25 or more km/wk (average of 42 km/wk) reported at least one URTI episode, as opposed to 34% training less than 25 km/wk (average of 12 km/wk) (p = 0.09). These findings suggest that, in recreational running, an average weekly distance of 42 versus 12 km is associated with either no change in or even a slight reduction of URTI incidence. Further, they suggest, that racing 5 km to 21.1 km is not related to an increased risk of sickness during the ensuing week.",

Neutrophils and macrophages migrate to the site of contraction-induced muscle damage, infiltrate the muscle tissue, activate the release of cytokines, and produce additional ROS. Most ROS are neutralized by a sophisticated antioxidant defense system consisting of a variety of enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants including vitamin A, E, and C; glutathione; ubiquinone; and flavonoids. Intensive and sustained exercise, however, can create an imbalance between ROS and antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress that not only causes lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, but may also impact immune function.",
