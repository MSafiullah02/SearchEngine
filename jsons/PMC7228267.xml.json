To describe the antigenic drift in the circulating H1N1 viruses from 2014 to 2015 season, we studied genetic diversity along with amino acid changes in HA and NA genes of 80 Saudi isolates. We found 42 and 14 amino acid changes in HA (Table 1 and Figure 2) and NA (Table 2) proteins respectively.

The amino acid substitutions in the form of reversion mutations observed especially in the head domain of antigenic sites were quite striking. For 2019 to 2020, influenza vaccine composition for Northern Hemisphere was recommended by WHO.\n64\n Food and Drug Administration (FDA) along with Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee make the influenza vaccine composition recommendation in the United States of America (USA).\n45\n, \n65\n Both agencies recommend that influenza trivalent vaccines contain an A/Brisbane/02/2018 A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010like virus, an A/Kansas/14/2017 A(H3N2)\u2010like virus, and a B/Colorado/06/2017\u2010like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. The recommendation for quadrivalent vaccine included the trivalent vaccine viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013\u2010like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. The A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) recommendations are an update to the 2018\u20102019 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. The A(H1N1)pdm09 component has been updated keeping in view of genetic and antigenic characterization data showing significantly reduced titers (eight\u2010fold or greater) to recent 6B.1A viruses, compared with the titers against the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine virus.\n66\n, \n67\n, \n68\n\n",

However, protective antibodies specific to the NA protein are also elicited in animal models and humans,\n71\n, \n73\n and antigenic drift in the NA has been reported to occur.\n74\n, \n75\n There were 14 mutations in the NA protein encoded by Saudi viruses circulating during the 2014\u201015 season when compared to the vaccine strain, 4 of which were located in previously identified antigenic sites (Table 2).\n53\n If the NAI Ab titers for the circulating strains are low than for the vaccine strain, it might suggest that there is antigenic variability in the NA protein expressed by currently circulating viruses. This, in turn, could lead to a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine. These antigenic differences could be due to the amino acid changes in defined Ab binding sites (N200S, N248D, N369K, and K432E).\n53\n Alternatively, due to the poor understanding of the antigenicity of the NA protein, some other amino acid changes might also affect the Ab binding.",

H1 gene sequences in comparison to 2010\u20102016 vaccine strain recently in India have shown mutations K166Q and S188T resulting in the emergence of variants.\n76\n Amino acid substitutions other than at position 166 in major antigenic site Sa can be selected by the immunological pressure of antibodies, that recognize an epitope including position 166. In combination with computational analyses and other methods,\n77\n in vitro selection of potential antigenic drift mutants could improve the selection of vaccine seed viruses.\n78\n Viral protein\u2010host interactions that are lost with the mutation are compensated by interactions with other amino acids, leading to a more stable HA.\n79\n The HA from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is steadily evolving towards a more stable and antigenically distinct protein.
