As with person A, there is no censoring here; the survival time is 3.5 weeks. to the event's occurrence or up to censorship. We have indicated in the last column whether this time was censored or not (with 1 denoting failed and 0 denoting censored). For example, the data for person C is a survival time of 3.5 and a censorship indicator of 0, whereas for person F the survival time is 3.5 and the censorship indicator is 1. This table is a simplified illustration of the type of data to be analyzed in a survival analysis. Notice in our example that for each of the four persons censored, we know that the person's exact survival time becomes incomplete at the right side of the follow-up period, occurring when the study ends or when the person is lost to follow-up or is withdrawn. We generally refer to this kind of data as right-censored. For these data, the complete survival time interval, which we don't really know, has been cut off (i.e., censored) at the right side of the observed survival time interval. Although data can also be left-censored, most survival data is right-censored. Left-censored data can occur when a person's true survival time is less than or equal to that person's observed survival time. For example, if we are following persons until they become HIV positive, we may record a failure when a subject firsts tests positive for the virus. However, we may not know exactly the time of first exposure to the virus, and therefore do not know exactly when the failure occurred. Thus, the survival time is censored on the left side since the true survival time, which ends at exposure, is shorter than the follow-up time, which ends when the subject tests positive.",

Thus, in some sense, the hazard function can be considered as giving the opposite side of the information given by the survivor function. 60 To get an idea of what we mean by instantaneous potential, consider the concept of velocity. If, for example, you are driving in your car and you see that your speedometer is registering 60 mph, what does this reading mean? It means that if in the next hour, you continue to drive this way, with the speedometer exactly on 60, you would cover 60 miles. This reading gives the potential, at the moment you have looked at your speedometer, for how many miles you will travel in the next hour. However, because you may slow down or speed up or even stop during the next hour, the 60-mph speedometer reading does not tell you the number of miles you really will cover in the next hour. The speedometer tells you only how fast you are going at a given moment; that is, the instrument gives your instantaneous potential or velocity.",

Note that in the hazard function formula, the expression to the right of the limit sign gives the ratio of two quantities. The numerator is the conditional probability we just discussed. The denominator is t, which denotes a small time interval. By this division, we obtain a probability per unit time, which is no longer a probability but a rate. In particular, the scale for this ratio is not 0 to 1, as for a probability, but rather ranges between 0 and infinity, and depends on whether time is measured in days, weeks, months, or years, etc. For example, if the probability, denoted here by P , is 1/3, and the time interval is one-half a day, then the probability divided by the time interval is 1/3 divided by 1/2, which equals 0.67 per day. As another example, suppose, for the same probability of 1/3, that the time interval is considered in weeks, so that 1/2 day equals 1/14 of a week. Then the probability divided by the time interval becomes 1/3 over 1/14, which equals 14/3, or 4.67 per week. The point is simply that the expression P divided by t at the right of the limit sign does not give a probability. The value obtained will give a different number depending on the units of time used, and may even give a number larger than one.",

Rather than simply throw away the information on a censored person, we use all the information we have on such a person up until time of censorship.

See Chapter 9 on competing risks for further details.) For example, for the three persons in group 1 who were censored between the 16th and 20th weeks, there are at least 16 weeks of survival information on each that we don't want to lose. These three persons are contained in all risk sets up to the 16th week; that is, they are each at risk for getting the event up to 16 weeks.
