The long-lived, complex, higher vertebrates have evolved specialized, adaptive immune systems designed to minimise the consequences of such parasitism. Through evolutionary time, the differential selective pressures exerted variously by the need for virus and host survival have shaped both the \"one-host\" viruses and vertebrate immunity. With the development of vaccines to protect us from many of our most familiar parasites, the most dangerous pathogens threatening us now tend to be those \"emerging\", or adventitious, infectious agents that sporadically enter human populations from avian or other wild-life reservoirs. Such incursions must, of course, have been happening through the millenia, and are likely to have led to the extraordinary diversity of recognition molecules, the breadth in effector functions, and the persistent memory that distinguishes the vertebrate, adaptive immune system from the innate response mechanisms that operate more widely through animal biology. Both are important to contemporary humans and, particularly in the period immediately following infection, we still rely heavily on an immediate response capacity, elements of which are shared with much simpler, and more primitive organisms. Perhaps we will now move forward to develop useful therapies that exploit, or mimic, such responses. At this stage, however, most of our hopes for minimizing the threat posed by viruses still focus on the manipulation of the more precisely targeted, adaptive immune system.",

Our most intimate passengers are the viruses, which only replicate in living cells. Many commensal organisms live in balance on skin and mucosal surfaces. Some of these apparently innocuous companions are clearly held in check by specific host response mechanisms, as they will invade and cause disease and death when the capacity to mount an effective T cell response is compromised by, for example, HIV/AIDS . This is also true for highly adapted pathogens like Epstein Barr virus (EBV), which may cause infectious mononucleosis following initial exposure, then persists as a substantially latent infection that can drive oncogenesis subsequent to loss of immune control [83] . Clearly, EBV has developed molecular strategies through evolutionary time that facilitate both spread and long-term carriage [69] .",

The molecular mimics of, for instance, cytokine and chemokine receptors that are found in the large, complex, DNA viruses indicates that the reverse may also be true for many one-host pathogens [94, 116] .

Many totally new viruses were discovered as a consequence of, for example, the Rockefeller Foundation-funded programs of 1950-1970. Some, like Ross River virus [41] were only found to be causative agents of human disease by retrospective analysis of stored serum samples.

The same may be true for many of the \"emerging\" pathogens that impact on humans and domestic animals suddenly, or sporadically, as a consequence of changes in culture, behaviour and/or environment. The need to deal effectively with this enormous spectrum of novel infectious agents is likely to have been one factor driving the extreme diversity of both the B cell (immunoglobulin) and T cell receptor (TCR) families [1, 7, 42] . Another may be the rapid variation associated with the error-prone copying mechanisms of some RNA viruses. Furthermore, as the T cells focus on complexes (epitopes) formed by the binding of processed viral peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [131] , the extreme polymorphism of the MHC [34, 92] can also be considered to reflect the evolutionary need to attach previously un-encountered spectra of peptides to one or another MHC glycoprotein.",

Some determining factors are virus growth characteristics, virus escape mechanisms, immune receptor (antibody or TCR) specificity and diversity, immune selective pressure, antigen presentation characteristics, lymphocyte proliferation rates and the quality of immune effector function, both at the cell and the molecular level.

Such pre-existing Ig may not completely block infection at (for example) mucosal surfaces [99] , but it does prevent the systemic spread of blood-born virus to distal sites of potential pathology such as the large motor neurons in poliomyelitis. One of the challenges for immunologists is to develop strategies for maintaining high levels of mucosal antibody [72] . Can we hope to vaccinate against HIV if the virus cannot be stopped at the initial site of entry? Antibody-mediated selection pressure drives the diversification of the influenza A viruses manifested as antigenic drift in the broader ecological context [46, 127] , while the continuing emergence of antibody escape variants within an infected individual is a depressingly familiar characteristic [54, 63] of pathogens like HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Recent strategies for developing neutralizing antibody response to (for example) the M2 channel protein that is expressed on the surface of the influenza A viruses [84] suggest that it may be possible to generate protective antibodies directed at conserved determinants expressed on molecular structures that have little, if any, capacity to vary.

In general, the requirement is for \"cognate help\": the two categories of lymphocytes must interact directly via TCR-mediated CD4 + T cell recognition of viral peptide in the binding site of the appropriate MHC class II glycoprotein on the surface of the B cell. Early IgA production may break this rule [105] , but there is still an absolute requirement for the concurrent stimulation of CD4 + T cells by other antigen presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells (DCs). The possible mechanism is that the T cells promote IgA production by B cells that have bound viral components via surface Ig and are in sufficient proximity to be stimulated by secreted lymphokines and cytokines.

This applies to both the generation and the recall of memory CD8 + T cells. Unlike the B cell/antibody response, CD4 + T help for the CD8 + responders is thought to operate via the DCs, with the role of the CD4 + T cells being to activate the DCs to be more effective antigen presenting cells [15, 100] . High-level virus persistence in the absence of CD4 + T help is also associated with a progressive loss of functional capacity by CD8 + T cell effectors [79, 82, 133] .

Another situation where IFN-\u03b3 produced by the CD8 + T cell is the primary mediator of virus control is in the transgenic mouse, human hepatitis model studied by F. Chisari and colleagues [53] . Production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD8 + T cells is also central to the limitation of alphavirus [18, 19] and enterovirus infections [101] in the central nervous system. Though inflammation may alter the normal profile [24, 97] , neurons do not generally express MHC class I glycoproteins [124] .

Persistent CD4 + T cell memory is, for example, found for adenoviruses in healthy humans [89] . Lack of progression to AIDS has been correlated with the continued presence of more HIV-specific IFN-\u03b3 than IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells in the peripheral circulation [91] . Priming CD4 + T cell memory to a prominent Sendai virus epitope led to a more rapid antibody response and enhanced virus clearance [136] . Low-level \u03b3HV68 persistence induced continuing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses that substantially prevented the establishment of further lytic, but not latent, infection following respiratory challenge of antibody-negative, \u00b5MT mice with the same virus [4] . Immune CD4 + and CD8 + T cells contributed to this protective effect in an additive way. Though adoptively-transferred CD4 + and CD8 + T cells promoted the recovery of \u00b5MT mice from influenza virus infection, the CD8 + set was clearly more effective in this regard [51] .

When memory T cell numbers are at what might be thought of as physiological levels, there is a clear necessity for further proliferation in the lymphoid tissue, followed by emigration into the blood and localization to the target organ [48] . Even when memory T cell numbers are very high in, for example, the lung, a rapidly growing influenza A virus will still become fully established before CD8 + T cell effectors operate to eliminate the infected cells and control the growth of the pathogen [29].",

In general, however, the host response is optimally mediated by all three categories of immune lymphocyte operating together. This is clearly the case for the large DNA viruses, particularly the herpesviruses, which also require the involvement of cytokine-producing CD4 + effector T cells [28] . Most of our successful vaccines to date depend on the capacity of a persistent neutralizing antibody response to limit systemic spread to distal sites of virus growth. Memory CD8 + T cells may not prevent the establishment of an infectious process, though the more rapid recall of CTL effector function is likely to ameliorate the severity of pathology and consequent clinical impairment by speeding virus clearance [29] . Again, with viruses that have the capacity to persist, the available evidence suggests that an optimal vaccine will prime all the components of adaptive immunity [3] . ",
