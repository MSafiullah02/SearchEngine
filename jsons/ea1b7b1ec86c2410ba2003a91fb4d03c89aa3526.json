This review aimed to synthesize the extant literature on networks and racial disparities in HIV among MSM and identify potential directions for future research. We searched databases for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2008 and July 1, 2018. Articles were included if the sample was comprised primarily of racial/ethnic minority MSM and measured one or more network characteristics. (n = 25). HIV prevalence in networks, social support, and structural barriers were linked to disparities in HIV for Black MSM. Future research should focus on intervention development around social support and other strategies for risk reduction within networks. Given the contribution of structural factors to racial/ethnic HIV disparities, network-level interventions should be paired with policies that improve access to housing, jobs, and education for MSM.",

La prevalencia del VIH en redes, el apoyo social, y las barreras estructurales estaban vinculadas a los disparidades en el VIH entre Afro-Americanos y Latinos HSH.

Dada la importancia de factores estructurales, las intervenciones de red deben estar emparejadas con pol\u00edticas que mejoren el acceso a la vivienda, el empleo, y la educaci\u00f3n para los HSH de minor\u00edas raciales/\u00e9tnicas.

            "text": "HIV prevention efforts have largely focused on reducing risk behaviors in populations affected by the disease. Research has shown, however, that these behavioral factors do not adequately explain racial disparities in HIV infection. A seminal paper from Millett et al. [2] found that BMSM report lower rates of substance abuse and fewer sexual partners than White MSM, and report similar rates of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), commercial sex work, sex with a partner who is known to be HIV positive, and lifetime HIV testing. A meta-analysis of HIV risk factors in MSM [3] found that BMSM were less likely to have a history of 1 3 substance abuse and more likely to use condoms. Despite these risk-reducing behaviors, BMSM were found to have higher rates of HIV and were less likely to have initiated medical treatment. Importantly, this study found BMSM experienced structural barriers, including poverty, incarceration and unemployment, at twice the rate of White MSM. These findings suggest that behavioral factors are not a primary contributor to the racial disparities in HIV incidence in MSM, and that higher-level distal factors (e.g. network factors or structural factors) likely play a more prominent role [4] .",

This suggestion sparked a wave of inquiry into how the dynamics of social and sexual networks relate to HIV transmission risk [5] [6] [7] [8] . It has been hypothesized that racial disparities in HIV are perpetuated and exacerbated by increased prevalence of HIV within Black communities and high racial homophily (i.e., the degree to which members of a network have the same racial identity) in the sexual networks of BMSM [9] . Social support within networks has also been identified as an influential factor in determining sexual risk behavior, viral load suppression, and HIV testing [10] [11] [12] . Recently, researchers have proposed network viral load, which refers to the total HIV viral activity within a connected network, as a metric of HIV risk [13] .",

Twelve studies enrolled only BMSM and Black transwomen. Nine studies measured social networks only, six measured sexual networks only, and ten studies measured both sexual and social networks. Of the studies reviewed, 22 measured egocentric networks (i.e. information is collected only from the participant) and three measured sociometric networks (i.e. information is obtained both from participants and from their network members).

Three studies found that the size of one's social network had an effect on sexual risk behavior, although the effect was different for BMSM than for Latino MSM. Larger social networks were associated with increased CAI in BMSM, while smaller social networks were associated with increased CAI in Latino MSM [16] [17] [18] . This difference by race was seen both in older MSM and young MSM (YMSM) and was consistent across studies in various US cities. In one study it was found that greater density amongst members of a social network was associated with lower rates of serodiscordant condomless intercourse (SDCI) with a non-primary partner, an effect that did not differ by race/ethnicity [19] . Another study found no connection between social network density and sexual risk behavior [20] .

One large multi-city study of BMSM found that larger sexual networks had a bivariate association with higher rates of CAI [21] , however a separate analysis of the same dataset that used SDCI as an outcome rather than any CAI found no association between sexual network size or density and SDCI in multivariate models [22] . Similarly, for YMSM in Chicago, no association was found between size or density of sexual networks and CAI [23] . Structural characteristics of social and sexual networks are inconsistent predictors of sexual risk behavior. The structure of social networks is more salient to behavior than the structure of sexual networks, and network factors manifest differently across racial/ethnic groups.",

The majority of the studies measured network-wide social support, but three studies used an actor-specific measure of social support where support from individual network members was assessed [20, 26, 27] . General perceived social support within a network was associated with lower rates of CAI [17, 28, 29] as was a measure of actor-specific HIV-related social support [20] . Lauby et al. [29] found that the relationship between general perceived social support within a network and HIV infection in their study was partially explained by changes in CAI. The direct impact of perceived social support on HIV incidence was explored in one notable prospective cohort study of BMSM in six major US cities, which found that having more people in one's emotional support network, medical support network, and social participation support network were all protective against seroconversion during the study period [27] . Two studies found no connection between social support and sexual risk behavior. One small study of homeless youth found no connection between actor-specific tangible enacted social support and sexual risk behavior [26] . A large multicity study of YMSM found that social support was unrelated to CAI [15] , although this study employed a measure of HIV-related social support within a network that had not previously been used or validated. Social support is an important determinant of sexual risk behavior and HIV risk, although differences in measurement and study population might modify this relationship.",

In addition to network factors, psychosocial factors and structural factors were also found to be involved in determining HIV risk and were often studied alongside network factors. This review highlights the importance of studying network characteristics in understanding racial disparities in the HIV epidemic.

Little evidence was found to suggest the structure of sexual networks was highly predictive of HIV risk, and the relationship between the structure of social networks and risk was complicated. Of note, we discovered that social network size had different effects on CAI in BMSM and Latino MSM samples. We believe this may be attributed to the different relationships that Black and Latino men might have to the mainstream gay community. Patterns of racism in the MSM community, including racialized sexual stereotypes [40] , may lead to Latino MSM finding greater support within this community, while BMSM may experience alienation or discrimination. Thus, as we consider the role of social networks in HIV risk among MSM, it is important to acknowledge varying effects that may be experienced among racial/ethnic minority groups. While basic structural characteristics such as size and density should still be measured, future research that measures more complex measures of network position, such as bridging [41] , could offer additional insight into how networks affect HIV risk.",

One of the few prospective cohort studies reviewed found a direct relationship between social support and decreased seroconversion [34] . These findings are compelling because they reveal the influence of social support on HIV risk, as well as suggesting sexual risk behavior as a potential mechanism by which this effect operates. Several evidence-based interventions for racial/ ethnic minority MSM have been described that leverage social networks to influence behavior change (e.g. Many Men, Many Voices and d-up: Defend Yourself! [42, 43] ), but little is known about the effects of these interventions at the network level.

This suggests that network viral load may be a more salient measure of HIV risk within a network than network HIV prevalence. Assessing network viral load also has several advantages over community viral load, another common measurement of aggregated viral activity [44] .

In fact, seeking to address racial homophily without mitigating the structural forces that have historically shaped these networks (e.g. racism, segregation) will be insufficient [45, 46] . Additionally, focusing on racial homophily as a risk factor for HIV risks pathologizing love and connection among communities of color [47] .

Second, our review was limited in scope.

As a result, our review excludes some network research (e.g., stochastic network modeling studies; see Fujimoto et al. for exemplar study) [52] that informs racial/ethnic HIV disparities. Additionally, the majority of the reviewed studies employed a cross-sectional study design, limiting our ability to draw conclusions about causation. Finally, there are inherent limitations to the egocentric (information derived solely from participant) network designs used by most studies in this review. Sociometric designs (information derived from all members of network), while more costly and burdensome, offer a more robust measurement of social and sexual networks.

The existing literature supports a multilevel model of HIV risk that implicates factors at the individual, network, and structural levels in creating and propagating racial disparities. Structural, functional, and compositional characteristics of networks have all been linked to HIV risk behaviors or racial disparities, suggesting that networks play a key role in shaping these outcomes. Development of intervention and policy should look beyond individual level behavior change. Research and intervention that focuses on factors at the network and structural levels to effectively address racial disparities in HIV are needed. These higher-level factors, which require cultural and economic shifts, may address the fundamental causes of these disparities and hold the potential to affect lasting change.",
