In a study from our ED-based SARS screening clinic during the outbreak in Hong Kong (which included afebrile patients), it was shown that 19% of SARS patients initially presented without fever, and that radiographic evidence of pneumonia often preceded fever.5 Therefore, a more useful tool for mass screening would have included fever or body temperature as a variable, thus allowing the evaluation of afebrile cases.2\n",

Although their scoring system was shown to have a sensitivity of 100%, this perfect figure will apply only specifically to those patients already screened as positive by the WHO criteria or case definition. Unfortunately, the WHO criteria for suspected SARS have been shown to have a sensitivity of only 26%.5 In practice, therefore, if 100 SARS patients presented to the ED for screening, only 26 would be correctly triaged to undergo the scoring system evaluation. Thus, relying on this strategy, despite the implementation of a near-perfect decision rule, will still result in an unacceptable number of missed cases.",

It remains to be proven whether the scoring systems in these studies, given the limitations addressed by the authors, can significantly outperform chest radiography.",
