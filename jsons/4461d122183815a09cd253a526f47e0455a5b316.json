Significance was assessed by asymptotic (t approximation) p-values <0.05 (see Table S2 ). Red indicates significant positive coefficients, blue indicates significant negative coefficients, and gray indicates coefficients not meeting the criteria of significance. Lower (2.5%) and upper (97.5%) quantiles from Spearman's rank coefficient distributions estimated under the null hypothesis of no virus-virus interactions are given in parentheses. The distribution under the null hypothesis was generated by randomly permuting each pair of virus infection time series data (monthly prevalence) 1000 times. CoV  IAV  IBV  MPV  PIV1  PIV2  PIV3  PIV4  RSV  RV  Table S3 : Correlation coefficients estimated multivariately using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, adjusting for fluctuations in testing frequency, autocorrelation and covariates (age, gender and general practice vs. hospital sample origin). Red indicates significant positive coefficients, blue indicates significant negative coefficients, and gray indicates coefficients not meeting the criteria of significance. Significance was indicated by a p-value <0.05 following a correction for multiple comparisons (see (1) for details) and a higher posterior density (HPD) estimate that excludes zero (see Table S5 below). Significant pairs are indicative of viral interactions and are presented in color in Fig.3 The steeper slope of the observed QQ line relative to the great majority of the permuted lines indicates that the observed p-values are lower than expected, providing strong evidence against the global null hypothesis of no association among any of the viruses (p = 0.0003; permutation test comparing the observed p-values from the observed data, combined using Fisher's method, to the 10,000 permuted data sets).",
