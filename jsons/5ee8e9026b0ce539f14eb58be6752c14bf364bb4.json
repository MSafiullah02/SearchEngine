CAP and NP arise in different populations, host different spectra of causative pathogens, and pose different challenges to both the clinician and the radiologist. CAP is generally seen in outpatients, is most frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Chlamydia, and its radiologic diagnosis is relatively straightforward. NP, in contrast, develops in the hospital setting, is commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and may generate substantial problems for the radiologist.

A patient who has fever and cough, and does not have radiologic proof of pneumonia, cannot be considered to have pneumonia.

Firstly, host factors, including immune status, underlying disorders, and age. Secondly, a high number of hospitalized patients receive antacids and histamine 2 -blockers, resulting in a rise of the gastric pH and an increase in gastric gram-negative bacterial counts. This gastric reservoir for gram-negative organisms frequently serves as a seed point for pharyngeal colonization, and nasogastric tubes, which are present in many severely ill patients, may provide a pathway for the bacteria to migrate. Gram-negative bacterial overgrowth of the oropharyngeal epithelium may then occur particularly when the normally adherent gram-positive flora is lost [17] . Thirdly, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may allow the pharyngeal germs direct access to the lungs. Fourthly, in supine patients and patients with decreased sensorium, direct aspiration of gastrointestinal contents into the lungs triggers the development of NP. Fifthly, microbial contamination of inserted drainage tubes, lines, and catheters is an important pathogenetic factor for the development of NP. Also, NP may result from bacteremia originating from right-sided endocarditis or septic pelvic thrombophlebitis.

Furthermore, the causative pathogen is frequently not readily identified: cultures from sputum and unprotected lavage fluid are of limited value because of the problems in distinguishing contamination from true infection. In addition, pulmonary disease in a hospital environment is frequently produced by more than one agent. These are just a few reasons why the identification of pulmonary infection, the use of various methods to identify the causative microorganism, the methodology to obtain a specimen, and the value of isolation of potential pathogens are matters of constant discussion in the clinical diagnosis of NP.

In principle, pattern recognition may help classify the large groups of organisms (i.e., bacilli, viruses, fungi); however, there are limitations to this approach. Firstly, patterns overlap. Secondly, a single organism may produce different patterns in different patients. The prototype for such chameleonlike behavior is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This atypical organism has the potential to cause acute air-space disease, bronchopneumonia, bilateral and diffuse disease, centrilobular lesions, ground-glass densities, and tree-inbud phenomena. The same holds true for the corona virus which was identified as causing SARS. The same organism, in this case a virus, triggered radiologic changes with a variety of patterns including acute air-space disease, ground-glass lesions, and bilateral diffuse abnormalities (Fig. 22) . Thirdly, radiographic patterns change with the immunologic status of the patient. This has been demonstrated for mycobacteria or Aspergillus fumigatus, which may cause three different patterns depending upon the immunologic situation of an individual [69, 70] . Finally, patterns may be altered by pre-or co-existing lung disease. Pattern recognition should only be attempted on an extensive knowledge of the radiographic features of pulmonary infections, and with the integration of clinical information.
