These pathogens may cause diseases with varying severity depending on the species infected. For example, increased humanprimate interactions through activities such as ecotourism, research, and bushmeat hunting result in an increased risk of cross-species viral transmission. 6, 7 Nonhuman primates, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla spp.), have been found to be susceptible to several pathogens carried by humans, including paramyxoviruses (eg, measles virus) 8 and intestinal bacteria, 7 which can be detrimental to the conservation of these endangered species. 9 Domestic animals such as cattle, goats, and sheep can perpetuate cycles of infection in humans through the contamination of drinking water with human enteric pathogens. 10, 11 Cryptosporidium hominis and Giardia lamblia, both human protozoal parasites, have been found in domestic cattle that have access to reclaimed wastewater. 12 The clinical presentation of common zooanthroponotic infections in animals is variable, and in some cases, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or measles virus in primates, the disease is often rapidly fatal. Here we review some of the major groups of zooanthroponoses, the mechanisms of transmission, and the impact on animal and human health.",

Human metapneumovirus and human respiratory syncytial virus are both related to measles virus (family Paramyxoviridae) and are common respiratory illnesses in Africa. 16, 17 Human metapneumovirus and human respiratory syncytial virus were found in some of the dead chimpanzees, and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these were of human origin. 14 Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), which are often used as human models in biomedical research because of their physiological response to many human pathogens, have been shown to have a pathology similar to that of humans when infected with measles. In cases of natural infection in a wild setting and in cases of infection in a laboratory, they experience a progression of clinical signs very similar to those experienced by humans, including maculopapular rash, fever, conjunctivitis, and even Koplik's spots on mucosal membranes. 13, 18 As with humans, macaques who recover from an initial measles infection will demonstrate immunity to measles virus. 18 Measles infections in nonhuman primates may also have varied or more severe courses. In one experiment, it was found that infected marmosets (Callithrix spp.) lacked symptoms commonly found in humans and some nonhuman primates, such as rash, coryza, and conjunctivitis, and they exhibited a longer subclinical infectious period and a much higher mortality rate. 19 The lack of rash and the increased mortality among these animals have been attributed to a decrease in the immunological response to the measles virus. 19 A longer subclinical period may make infected marmosets more dangerous to susceptible humans.",

Pigs are unique in that they are susceptible to infection with both avian and human subtypes of influenza A; this allows them to act as mixing vessels for new strains via genetic reassortment. 24 Pigs are likely to have been infected with the pandemic H1N1 strain of 1918 by circulating human strains after the first wave of infection swept through the United States in 1918. 25 The pandemic in 1918 was the first instance of flu being described in pigs, and it spread widely throughout the United States, leading to recurrent outbreaks in pig populations and the name swine flu. H1N1 causes varying levels of morbidity in pigs, although it is rarely fatal. Strains of H1N1 have circulated in domestic swine herds in North America and Europe for decades since 1918, although in the1990s, H2N3 became the predominant strain in pigs in North America. 26 -28 In 2009, a novel strain of H1N1 emerged in Veracruz, Mexico and quickly spread to the United States and more than 30 other countries via global travel networks, rapidly becoming a global pandemic. 27 Genomic sequencing of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain revealed that it was a novel strain that included genetic material with avian, swine, and human origins but that was not known to be circulating in swine herds. 29 The usual economic impact of H1N1 infection in swine herds is due to the high levels of morbidity, which include substantial weight loss and restriction on movement. However, H1N1 had a significant impact on the Mexican economy, which had an estimated $2.2 billion loss due to the closure of businesses and a drop in travel and tourism, 30 as well as a negative effect on the greater global economy because of the incorrect presumption that pigs were responsible for the human cases. 31, 32 Additionally, the false perception that consuming pork could cause infection further affected the global swine trade. 33 The only confirmed outbreak to date of the novel H1N1 strain in pigs occurred in a swine herd in Canada in March 2009. A laborer from the farm, who had recently traveled to Mexico, returned sick and may have introduced the H1N1 virus to the herd. 34 As the number of human cases increases globally, so too does the risk of additional instances of zooanthroponotic flu transmission, as was the case in 1918.",

One result of this, however, has been a lack of adequate surveillance in animals for humanborne pathogens, which may also have significant health and economic consequences.",

Even though many zooanthroponotic infections occur in captive animals because of contact with researchers, trainers, and keepers, these pathogens may potentially emerge in free-living populations of the same or related species and have farreaching detrimental effects on biodiversity and human health. 2 Furthermore, surveillance and control measures designed to prevent zooanthroponotic infections may also serve to protect human health by preventing spillback from animals to humans. In the case of flu, the infection of pigs with human influenza viruses has the additional risk of creating novel, potentially more virulent flu strains via genetic reassortment. 57 The transmission of pathogens between humans and nonhuman species (in either direction) is driven by anthropogenic factors that increase contact between humans and animals. 2,58 These factors include agricultural expansion and intensification,",

Comprehensive scientific disciplines, such as conservation medicine, that recognize the links between human, animal, and ecosystem health, provide an effective approach to understanding the complex multidirectional exchange of pathogens among humans, wildlife, and domestic animals. 2, 59 As the rate of emerging infectious diseases (in humans and animals) is likely to increase with an increase in anthropogenic pressures, it is important that we develop a better understanding of the potential for and occurrence of cross-species pathogen transmission in order to successfully protect human, animal, and ecosystem health.",
