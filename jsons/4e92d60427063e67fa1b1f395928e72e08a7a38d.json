Co-occurrence networks were highly nested with relatively low modularity, particularly at a medium taxonomic resolution. Nonetheless, RVF did cluster separately from the other pathogens tested via serology which potentially indicates that RVF, unlike the other epidemic viruses, has a distinct epidemic cycle with most of the interacting partners being more chronic pathogens. This is supported by the RVF association profile detected in our JSDM analysis and is intuitive given that RVF is the only mosquito-borne pathogen that we sampled. Even though we sampled pathogens considered important for lion health, we lacked data on other potentially pathogenic bacteria, helminths and fungi that the lions were exposed to or potentially infected by. Furthermore, symbiont interactions can also be important in shaping pathogen dynamics (e.g. Halliday et al. 2017 ) and could be considered in pathogen infra-community studies. These additional taxa may lead to further segregation in the network, as larger and more diverse networks typically show increased modularity and segregation (Thebault & Fontaine 2010; Sauve et al. 2014) .

Parvoviruses are also immune suppressive, and so the timing of the parvovirus outbreak may also have contributed to the CDV/Babesiainduced mortality.

The inability to distinguish mortality or correlated exposure (i.e. an individual is infected by multiple pathogens in the same transmission event) from negative or positive associations is one of them, and careful interpretation of associations is necessary. Incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underlie candidate pathogen associations (Carver et al. 2015) could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies. Another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely. For example the negative association between RVF and H. felis could be due to temporal differences when ticks and mosquitoes emerge after rains. Years with higher rainfall increase mosquito abundance thus increasing RVF prevalence (Fig. S2) , whereas ticks emerge en masse when rains follow a dry period potentially increasing H. felis prevalence (Munson et al. 2008) . As rainfall was calibrated to the year of sampling rather than the age of infection (which could differ) the JSDM approach could not capture this variation. Studies using longitudinal data to quantify associations using a similar framework to ours (e.g. Telfer et al. 2010; Henrichs et al. 2016 ) will be beneficial as they are likely to provide more robust estimates of the order of infection in wild populations. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density. Lastly, incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and JSDM analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure (Griffiths et al. 2014) .
