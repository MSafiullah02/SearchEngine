Suspected type E-induced disease in rabbits must be differentiated from that caused by C. spiroforme\n[3], [15]. Strains of type E are distinguished from other toxinotypes by their production of iota toxin, which consists of two non-covalently associated components and ADP-ribosylates actin at Arg-177 [16], [17], [18]. Little is known of the pathogenesis of type E infections, although it is assumed that, in keeping with the pattern set by isolates of other toxin types, iota toxin plays an important role.",

Silent cpe sequences, found near the iota toxin genes on episomal DNA, were highly conserved among type E isolates, but contained nine nonsense and two frameshift mutations and lacked the initiation codon, promoters, and ribosome binding site. This is remarkable, given that sequencing of cpe from eight different isolates revealed 100% sequence homology [19], [23], [24], [25]. These strains were apparently not clonal; location of cpe sequences, with iap and ibp, on episomal DNA and lack of isolate-specific mutations suggests recent wide distribution among C. perfringens isolates.",
