Born in Sri Lanka, there was no recent history of foreign travel and no significant family history. He denied the use of recreational drugs, and only occasionally used alcohol modestly. On physical examination he was found to be a well-muscled gentleman, with a painful proximal myopathy of both the upper and lower limbs; otherwise, the examination was grossly unremarkable.",

He developed several episodes of large bowel obstruction which required decompression with sigmoidoscopy and/or rectal tube insertion. There was no obvious lesion or volvulus seen upon endoscopy, or electrolyte inbalance to explain these repeated episodes.

Drug induced myopathies represent a distinct subgroup of myopathies that differ in terms of their pathological mechanisms [2]. This group of disorders is of great interest to the clinician as the disease progress may be limited or reversed by treatment of the underlying cause [3]. Toxic myopathies also serve as excellent experimental models in relation to muscle research. Toxic myopathies may be divided into six groups [2]. These are necrotizing myopathy, vacuolar myopathy, inflammatory myopathy, mitochondrial myopathy, steroid myopathy and hypokalaemic myopathy [2].",

Animal models have indeed demonstrated the ability of such agents to induce a generalised myopathic state. The potentially beneficial effects of androgenic anabolic steroids in a medical setting have been well recognised since the 1960s. There appears to be an increasing amount of published literature in regards to emerging areas to which these compounds may be suitable.
