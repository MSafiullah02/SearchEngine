Among these viruses, NDV is a member of the Avulavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family and is prevalent worldwide and infects almost all avian species. In fact, highly contagious respiratory, enteric, and neurological diseases in chickens are often caused by a variety of infectious NDV strains [1, 2] . AIV is an enveloped virus with a segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family and can cause clinical diseases in a wide range of mammalian and avian species. Low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H9 circulates worldwide in multiple avian species thereby posing a potential threat to not only the poultry industry, but also to public health [3, 4] . IBV is a gammacoronavirus of the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales [5] , and primarily replicates in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and causes lower respiratory tract infections in chickens (Gallus domesticus). In addition, emerging IBV isolates that vary in their replicative abilities in nonrespiratory tissues have been associated with proventriculus and kidney lesions [6, 7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 653, "end": 656, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 657, "end": 659, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1062, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1065, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1173, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1490, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1493, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Proteomic analyses of pathogen-infected organisms can offer significant insight to the \"battle\" between pathogens and host during infection, hence proteomic analyses of host cellular responses against viral infections could aid in identification of potential host factors involved in the viral life cycle and host defense mechanisms.
