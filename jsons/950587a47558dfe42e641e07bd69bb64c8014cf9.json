Because they target conserved host proteins, not variable viral proteins, HTAs have the potential for pangenotypic antiviral activity and a high barrier to resistance. Only two HTAs have reached clinical development, including specific inhibitors of cyclophilin A peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and antagonists of microRNA-122. Cyclophilin inhibitors have proven to be relatively well tolerated and can be confidently used as backbones of all-oral, interferon-free regimens. In addition, HTAs such as cyclophilin inhibitors offer opportunities for ''panviral'' approaches when they target mechanisms common to viruses of the same or different families.

New HCV drugs split into two groups: direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), that target viral actors of the HCV lifecycle, and host-targeted agents (HTAs), that block HCV production by interacting with host cell components (Pawlotsky, 2013) . For many years, only HTAs were available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. They included interferon-a (IFN-a), which triggers an intracellular cascade of events that, in turn, activate a number of nonspecific antiviral cellular effectors, and ribavirin, a drug that accelerates infected cell clearance or cure when HCV production is potently inhibited through yet unknown mechanisms (Chevaliez and Pawlotsky, 2009; Thomas et al., 2013; Feld, in press; Koh and Liang, in press ). More recently, HTAs targeting host cell components involved in complex interactions with viral proteins that are essential to the HCV lifecycle have been developed.",

            "text": "The HCV lifecycle starts with receptor binding at the surface of hepatocytes. HCV entry into cells is pH-dependent and related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is followed by a fusion step within an acidic endosomal compartment. Decapsidation of viral nucleocapsids liberates free positive-strand genomic RNAs in the cell cytoplasm, where they serve, together with newly synthesized RNAs, as messenger RNAs for synthesis of the HCV polyprotein. The polyprotein is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where co-and post-translational processing by host cell peptidases, the NS2 autocatalytic protease and the NS3-4A serine protease results in the generation of the 3 structural proteins (C or core, E1 and E2), the p7 viroporin, and the 6 nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B). Replication is catalyzed by the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or NS5B protein. The NS5A protein and the NS3 helicase-NTPase domain of the NS3 protein play an important regulatory role in virus replication, whereas NS4B serves as a membrane anchor for the replication complex and plays an important role in membrane rearrangements leading to its formation. Viral particle formation is initiated by the interaction of the core protein with genomic RNA. HCV then uses the lipoprotein production pathway to generate mature viral particles and export them (Lindenbach, 2013; Lohmann, 2013; Niepmann, 2013; Zeisel et al., 2013) .",

Both classes of compounds reduced viral replication by several logs when administered to infected patients in Phase Ib and II clinical trials (Flisiak et al., 2008; Janssen et al., 2013) . Drugs that interact with the lipid metabolism, such as statins, have been shown to inhibit the in vitro replication of HCV by blocking the late steps of the HCV lifecycle.

            "text": "To cure HCV infection, a drug regimen must combine antiviral potency and a high barrier to resistance that ensures that inhibition of virus production is sustained over the full treatment period. When this is the case, infected cells progressively eliminate the RNA genomes they contain until no more cells are infected at the time treatment is withdrawn. Cyclophilin A inhibitors were shown to potently inhibit viral replication, both in vitro and in vivo (Flisiak et al., 2008; Paeshuyse et al., 2006) . Because they target conserved host proteins, not variable viral proteins, both cyclophilin A inhibitors and miR-122 antagonists have pangenotypic antiviral activity and a high barrier to resistance (Coelmont et al., 2009; Flisiak et al., 2008; Lanford et al., 2010; Paeshuyse et al., 2006; Puyang et al., 2010) . No resistance has been reported thus far with miR-122 antagonists in vivo. However, viral polymorphisms associated with resistance to miR-122 antagonism have been reported in a recent in vitro study (Li et al., 2011) . Whether such variants naturally exist in infected patients is unknown. Amino acid substitutions in viral proteins are hardly selected by cyclophilin A inhibitors after numerous passages in vitro (Coelmont et al., 2009; Flisiak et al., 2008; Lanford et al., 2010; Paeshuyse et al., 2006; Puyang et al., 2010) . They are essentially located in the NS5A protein sequence, confer minor reduction in drug susceptibility in vitro, and do not appear to play a role in cyclophilin inhibitor treatment failures in vivo. HTAs thus represent ideal ''backbones'' for pangenotypic drug combinations with potent antiviral activity and a high barrier to resistance, both for first-line use in treatment-na\u00efve patients or Host-targeted anti-HCV approaches however have caveats. In theory, because they target host cellular functions that may be essential to cell survival, they can be toxic. The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins catalyzes the isomerization of peptide bonds at proline residues and facilitates protein folding. However, mice knocked-out for cyclophilins are viable, and they even seem to be protected against lethal heart ischemia-reperfusion injury (Belaidi et al., 2013) . In clinical practice, the administration of alisporivir, a cyclophilin A inhibitor derived from cyclosporine A currently in Phase II clinical development, was associated with mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia, that was dose-dependent and reversible upon treatment withdrawal. Hyperbilirubinemia was mixed, due to inhibition of the uptake unconjugated bilirubin transporters organic anion transporter bilirubin OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and of conjugated bilirubin efflux transporter canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1 MRP2, without inhibition of glucuronide conjugation (Flisiak et al., 2008; Pawlotsky et al., 2012b) . Alisporivir administration was also associated with hypertriglyceridemia (Pawlotsky et al., 2012b) , which may have aggravated acute pancreatitis cases that occurred in combination with IFN-a (including one fatal case). For this reason, the clinical efficacy of alisporivir is currently being studied as part of IFN-free combinations only. No side effects were observed over 2 weeks of administration of miravirsen, an miR-122 antagonist (Janssen et al., 2013) .

It must be noted, however, that unexpected, sometimes serious adverse events are not specific for HTAs. Numerous side effects have been reported with inhibitors from each of the different classes of HCV DAAs. The development of several compounds was halted early because of serious adverse events, including fatal cases. The large-scale use of the two first-generation protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir in combination with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin was associated with frequent side effects, with particular toxicity in patients with advanced liver disease (Hezode et al., 2013) . Finally, not all DAAs currently in clinical development are entirely safe. Overall, over the past 10 years of HCV drug development, HTAs directly targeting host cell components involved in the HCV lifecycle did not appear to be substantially more toxic than DAAs.",

Indeed, cyclophilin inhibitors can be confidently used as backbones of all-oral, IFN-free regimens because of their potency, their pangenotypic activity, their high barrier to resistance and their good tolerance in the absence of IFN-a co-administration. A recent study showed that alisporivir has synergistic effects in vitro with different families of DAAs (Garcia-Rivera et al., 2013) . Thus, drug regimens combining a cyclophilin inhibitor with a protease inhibitor, an RdRp inhibitor and/or an NS5A inhibitor with or without ribavirin are credible and will likely enter clinical evaluation soon. Whether or not other host-targeted approaches should be investigated for the treatment of HCV infections is debatable. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the drug industry currently disinvests from new HCV drug screening and optimization, with the belief that enough drugs will be on the market soon to fulfill the clinical needs.",

Host-targeted antiviral approaches offer the opportunity of ''panviral'' antiviral approaches when they target mechanisms that are common to viruses that belong to the same or different families. Given the number of viral infections that represent important public health problems for which no specific antiviral compounds exist or are likely to be developed in the short-to mid-term, research on host-targeted approaches to combat viral infections should be encouraged.
