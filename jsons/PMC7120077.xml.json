Hence suitable samples may not be collected at the appropriate time leading to misdiagnosis and a delay initiation of therapy.The common clinical presentation [1, 6, 7] of most respiratory pandemic viruses is that of an \u2018influenza-like illness (ILI)\u2019: an acute respiratory infection with sudden onset of fever (temperature of >38 \u00b0C or >100.4 \u00b0F), chills, myalgia and a non-productive cough. Sore throat and rhinorrhoea may also be present. Many cases are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhoea.A history of contact, in the preceding 10 days of symptom onset with poultry or with a known case in the countries detected to have human avian influenza cases, has to be elicited. Likewise, history of travel to the Middle East countries should arouse suspicion of a MERS-CoV infection.Cases may range from a mild ILI to a fulminant viral pneumonia. Rapid clinical deterioration may occur with diffuse viral pneumonitis with hypoxaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, multisystem organ failure and death occurring within a week of onset of illness [7].Secondary bacterial pneumonia especially due to Staphylococcus aureus, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae is a common complication with influenza [7].Extremes of age; pregnancy; obesity; presence of pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, renal or metabolic co-morbidities; and underlying neurological conditions are the common risk factors for severe disease [1, 6].Case fatality of H5N1 is much higher than seasonal influenza viruses with rapid clinical deterioration mainly due to early involvement of the lower respiratory tract.\n",

The only caveat is that appropriate clinical samples need to be collected at the appropriate time during the disease and should be transported to the laboratory in cold chain in a viral transport medium so as to maintain the viability of the nucleic acid.Multiplex PCR can detect simultaneously other viruses causing a similar clinical picture like the seasonal influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus.The most preferred specimen is a nasopharyngeal aspirate or a swab preferably within 1\u20132 days of onset of disease [6]. Cotton swabs are not recommended due to presence of inhibitors; rayon- or nylon-flocked swabs are used instead. Broncho-alveolar lavage, tracheal aspirates and sputum which contains the highest viral loads are the ideal specimens especially later in the course of illness [6].RT-PCR tests may be carried out on serum specimens.In case of suspicion of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, stool specimens may also be sent to the laboratory.Many a times these newer molecular assays may not be available even in established diagnostic molecular laboratories and the specimen may have to be shipped under strict biohazard protocols to the national or a regional reference centre for testing.\n",

High-resolution computed tomography may be required in ambiguous cases.Tests done to rule out other infectious aetiology include blood cultures, Gram\u2019s stain and culture of the sputum and urinary antigen detection for legionella and pneumococci.

It has been used extensively in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Resistance to oseltamivir has been documented [8]. Best results were obtained when treatment was started within 48 h of symptom onset even before the availability of laboratory results.The dosage of oseltamivir for persons above 13 years of age and >40 kg weight is 75 mg twice daily for duration of 5 days.For children <15 kg, the dose of oseltamivir is 30 mg twice a day, 15\u201323 kg is 45 mg twice a day and >23\u201340 kg is 60 mg twice daily.Zanamivir is advised for persons above 5 years of age at a dose of 10 mg (two inhalations) twice a day. Oseltamivir is the drug of choice to treat human cases of avian influenza.Unlike influenza there is no specific antiviral or vaccine available for the coronaviruses. A combination of ribavarin and interferon 1\u03b1 shows synergistic action in vivo and has been used to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections but limited data is available on their effectiveness to combat the disease and clinical trials are needed to demonstrate their effectiveness [1].Steroids were used during the SARS outbreak to limit the cytokine-mediated lung injury in conjunction with ribavirin but the actual role of steroids has to be elucidated with further studies. Steroids are contraindicated in cases of influenza pneumonia as it may further predispose to secondary bacterial infection.\n",

It is advised by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that all persons over 6 months of age be vaccinated annually against the predicted influenza strains which are most likely to cause infections in the next influenza season based on surveillance data. It is available as an annual influenza vaccine incorporating three or four live attenuated or inactivated influenza strains. It is available for administration as nasal sprays (live attenuated vaccine) and the intramuscular or intradermal route (killed vaccine).\nChemoprophylaxis [7]:Oseltamivir and Zanamivir (neuraminidase inhibitors) are active against both influenza A and B viruses. It is indicated in exposed unvaccinated immunocompromised persons or people with co-morbid conditions who are at a high risk of developing influenza.Oseltamivir should be given within 1 day after exposure at a dose of 75 mg once daily for persons 13 years and above of age for a minimum of 10 days after exposure to a recent contact with a known case of influenza.Zanamivir is prescribed at two inhalations once daily for people above 5 years of age. If the exposed person develops respiratory symptoms, he should be given treatment doses of the drug.In case of H5N1, close contacts of strongly suspected cases of human avian influenza and personnel handling infected poultry are advised oseltamivir as chemoprophylaxis [10].\n\nStandard contact, droplet and airborne precautions [11]:\n",

But going by the past experience especially in case of SARS-CoV, healthcare personnel were the ones at high risk of infection given the close proximity to the patient. Hence it is important that all staff follow the standard contact and droplet precautions for any case suspected to have a respiratory infection.Contact and droplet precautions include wearing of personnel protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, gowns, eye and face shields.There is special emphasis on hand hygiene which must be diligently performed before and after contact with the patient, the potentially infectious material generated by him, before wearing and after removing PPE.Airborne precautions include placement of patients in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and wearing of N95 or greater respirators and masks. Airborne transmission is especially possible while suctioning a ventilated patient, bronchoscopy, sputum induction, intubation and extubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.Pending placement of patient in the AIIR a face mask must be placed on the patient and the patient isolated in a single room to prevent spread of infection.Environment infection control must be followed per hospital infection control policy using a suitable disinfectant for disinfection and collection, transport and treatment of all infectious waste generated.\n",
