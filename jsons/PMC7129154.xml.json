Natural plasmids have systems guaranteeing their autonomous replication but also mechanisms controlling the copy-number and ensuring stable inheritance during cell division. Plasmids have evolved as an integral part of the bacterial genome, providing additional functions to their host. The best example of functions associated to a plasmid is given by the antimicrobial resistance. Resistance genes located on plasmids offer immediate advantage to their host under antimicrobial pressure and they can be easily exchanged among bacteria of different species and genera, through the natural process of conjugation, rapidly spreading in bacteria of diverse origin and source.",

The observed high frequency of multiresistance suggests mechanisms by which bacterial species can concentrate and efficiently exchange a variety of resistance determinants. Lateral gene transfer, which has been proposed as a fundamental process underlying bacterial diversity, is mainly mediated through plasmids and phages. While integrons are capable of concentrating resistance genes, they are uncapable of self-transposition. The mobility of the resistance genes is mediated by insertions sequences and transposons. Along with the discovery of novel resistance genes, the number of different transposable elements isolated and characterised at the nucleotide sequence level is exploding, and over 1500 different ISs have been identified to date.",

Most IS elements exhibit short terminal inverted-repeat sequences (IR) and encode a transposase, an enzyme that is required for transposition. These mobile elements play an important role in assembling sets of \u201caccessory\u201d functions in bacteria (such as genes forming parts of degradative or catabolic pathways) and in dissemination of resistance genes. By inserting within a coding sequence they may inactivate the gene, or by inserting upstream of a gene they may modify its expression. ISs may also help integration of plasmids into the chromosome of bacteria. Some ISs, such as ISEcp1, are capable of mobilising nearby DNA, by a mechanism similar to one-ended-transposition, while others may form a composite transposon, being capable of carrying the sequence located between the two ISs. True transposons such as Tn7, and the large group of type II transposons of the Tn3 family are complicated structures and include multiple antibiotic resistance genes carried by integrons. The association of integrons with transferable elements may promote rapid dissemination among clinical strains, and create further opportunities for inclusion of additional resistance determinants. Recently novel genetic structures, Repeated Elements (Re), have been described being capable of mobilising resistance genes through a transposition/recombination process that still needs to be fully understood.",

            "text": "Synthetic antibacterial drugs such as antifolates, sulfonamides and quinolones have been widely used in human and veterinary practice over the last 60 years. The clinical efficacy of these drugs is undermined by the integration and spreading of resistance borne on transmissible plasmids and genetic islands. In 1977, Pattishall et al. divided the plasmid-borne trimethoprim resistance genes into two distinctive structural classes later referred to as dfrA and dfrB. The number of identified gene types has grown to more than 30 at present. We matched the contexts of all sequenced dfr genes with signatures of two gene capture mechanisms. These are uptake of gene cassettes in integrons by site-specific recombination and one-ended transposition mediated by IS91-like elements referred to as common regions or ISCR. The data we assembled showed that trimethoprim resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is spread, at nearly full coverage, via either of these recombinational paths. Nineteen types of dfr genes in three families, examplified by the gene types A1, A12 and B1, are borne on integron-based cassettes while seven dfr gene types, A3b. A9, A10, A19, A20, A23 and A26 (Grape et al., unpublished) have been inserted via the second recombination path. IS91 family insertion elements use a one-ended transpositional mechanism to produce single-stranded DNA through rolling circle replication. Integron cassettes use recombination sites that are in fact recognized by the cognate tyrosine recombinase in the form of harpins. This suggests that IS91 might enhance excision and integration of cassettes that are situated within replication range of IS91-like elements. If the two gene capture systems are indeed engaged in a functional crosstalk this could explain their frequent co-localisation. The spreading of resistance to other synthetic drugs differs. For instance, sulfonamide resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is ubiquitous but much less diverse with only three gene types in the metagenomic pool. The recombinational spread of sul genes is cryptic and may be diverse. However, one of the genes, sul1, is strongly linked with both integrons and common regions of the IS91 type. Sulfonamides were introduced prior to other modern antibacterial drugs suggesting that it was the key selecting factor for making the dual recombinational platform of integrons and IS91-like elements fixed in most bacterial populations. Quinolone resistance gets contribution from transmissible qnr alleles of three families reported in connection with IS91-like regions (Robicscek et al. 2006).",

Insertions sequence common regions (ISCRs) were first discovered and reported in the early 1990's as a DNA sequence of 2,154bp that was found in two complex class 1 integrons, In6 and In7. The sequence was initially described as a common region (CR) to distinguish it from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 conserved sequence of class 1 integrons. ISCRs were also interesting in that they are intimately associated with different resistance genes carried on each integron. ISCR elements have been found in many Gram-negative bacteria and have been associated with an array of different antibiotic resistant functions including qnr, ESBLs, AmpC \u03b2-lactamases, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases, aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol resistance, dhfr and sul genes. Some bacteria contain several copies of these elements that have probably occurred via replication followed by homologous recombination. They can be located on either the chromosome or/and plasmid.",

These motifs have been shown to be involved in DNA recognition and mobility. ISCR elements are very unusual in that, like IS91, they can mobilise large sections of adjacent DNA via a rolling circle replication. Normally, termination of replication occurs at a defined site; misreading of this site leads to replication of large sections of DNA to the left-hand end of the element including antibiotic resistance genes. Many elements are found next to class 1 integrons which we believe to be expressed and active \u2013 possibly driven by a hybrid promoter. The only ISCR element shown not to be expressed is ISCR2. They are now commonly found in Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-negative non-fermentors and occasionally Gram-positive bacteria and have been found in clinical isolates from every continent.

HCV or HIV status of the source was not known for more than 20% of documented BBFE. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was prescribed to 4.5% of exposed personnel (vs. 5.8% in 2003 and 6.3% in 2002); this decrease may reflect the impact of April 2003 French recommendations, which reduced PEP indications. For the first time in 2004, sutures were the most frequent cause of BBFE associated with needles (more than subcutaneous injections) and accounted for 1,103 (11%) of all BBFE; one third occurred among residents, and 20% in ICU or emergency rooms (beyond surgery or obstetrics). Prevention through education and use of safety devices (such as blunt suture needles) may thus be a priority. Data from a cohort of 173 HCF which participated in 2003 and 2004 also were compared and demonstrate significant progresses. Compliance to glove use increased from 58.6% in 2003 to 62.3% in 2004, and BBFE incidence among nurse assistants fell from 2.3 in 2003 to 2.1 per 100 FTE in 2004.

The importance of epidemiological data cannot be underestimated. Data on prevalence can inform empirical therapy requirements or help in the design of intervention strategies. Prevalence can be established for the population in general, or, specific subgroups such as children, military personnel, indigenous or disadvantaged populations can be targeted. Community intervention measures similar to the \u2018search and destroy\u2019 techniques used in hospitals would require large-scale screening. A narrower approach concentrating on high-risk groups to enable programmes such as education on hygiene to reduce transmission would allow a more targeted screening programme. A second more pragmatic area for screening is on admission or during hospitalisation. In some areas in the world there is a blurring of the boundaries of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA. These organisms have now been reported as a cause of hospital acquired bacteraemia, surgical and prosthetic joint infection and to colonise neonates and adult patients in hospitals. Targeted screening of high-risk patients or all patients on entry into high-risk units are strategies to prevent CA-MRSA from becoming endemic in hospitals. Screening to control recognized outbreaks entails identification of the reservoir to enable appropriate isolation, cohorting and decolonisation measures. The value of screening healthcare workers for carriage of CA-MRSA has yet to be established.",

The requirement for broth amplification increases the sensitivity for some of these methods but also increases the time to identification.

Recent developments in the field of pneumococcal pathogenesis reflect significant developments in both genomics and proteomics. The breadth of microbial genetic diversity is increasingly being recognized. Our understanding of the importance of traditional virulence factors such as polysaccharide capsule, pneumolysin and generation of hydrogen peroxide is evolving while important roles for factors such as pneumococcal pili are emerging. Genetic screens are identifying increasing roles for previously poorly characterised proteins involved in metabolism and transport of key molecules. The importance of the physical state of the bacteria in different tissue compartments is also becoming evident. An improved range of models of various aspects of infection ranging from colonisation and sub-clinical infection to fulminant pneumonia and invasive disease are allowing assessment of both microbial and host factors central to disease pathogenesis. The range of receptors involved in the innate response to pneumococci in the respiratory tract is starting to be appreciated and includes Toll-like receptors and receptors primarily involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria. The interaction between soluble factors and the resident phagocytes of the lung is being clarified and the complexity of cytokine networks involved in the innate host response is being elucidated. Important roles for T-lymphocytes, Natural Killer cells and dendritic cells in the response to pneumococci are being identified. Furthermore our understanding of the regulation of the inflammatory response and of the significant role of apoptosis in the regulation of the inflammatory response has lead to important insights into how cell survival and outcome of infection are closely linked. These observations are enabling a more scientific interpretation of many of the central clinical features of pneumococcal pneumonia and may encourage novel approaches to therapy to improve disease responses.",

The carrier state is more frequent in young children and may reach over 70% in some populations such as those attending day-care centres. Indeed, this latter group has been found to be a major reservoir of pneumococci playing a key role on the amplification and transmission of the bacteria to other individuals. Of interest, several drug-resistant clones internationally disseminated have been found to be frequently carried by this population. In recent years, there has been some debate on the relative contribution of serotype and genetic background to the invasive disease potential of pneumococcal strains. We will present a study that addresses this question. The study was conducted in Portugal and results from the detailed comparison of two large collections of pneumococcal isolates: a group of over 450 invasive disease isolates and a group of over 750 colonisation isolates collected during the same time period which were characterised in detail by antibiogram, serotype, PFGE macro-restriction profiles, and multilocus sequence typing.

Understanding invasive disease epidemiology, both preceding vaccine implementation and after vaccine introduction, is crucial to the design and development of future vaccines. Several recent studies have shown that pneumococcal serotypes differ in their invasive disease potential, and this has particular relevance for the selection of serotypes to include in future conjugate vaccines.

The vaccine as currently formulated affords protection against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due to the 7 most common serotypes causing IPD among children less than 2 years of age prior to vaccine introduction in the USA. This formulation is not optimal for many developing countries where serotypes such as 1 and 5 are important. Global, second generation vaccines therefore include at least 10 serotypes. The importance of prevention of pneumococcal disease extends beyond IPD to pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, prevention of antibiotic-resistant infections, and even prevention of mortality in young infants. Each of these presents specific challenges. The vaccine has been shown to prevent between 25% and 37% of all cause X-ray confirmed pneumonias and this implies a level of protection against pneumococcal pneumonia due to vaccine serotypes in excess of 70%. This reduction in pneumonia has translated into a reduction in all-cause mortality due to the vaccine of 16% in rural Africa. The major preventable burden of disease in Africa may be among HIV infected children where the vaccine has also been shown to reduce pneumonia burden. An innovative aspect of the vaccine is the fact that it may reduce the pneumococcal super infections that follow viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, and conjugate vaccination of children may thus be a useful adjunct to pandemic influenza planning preparedness. The interruption of carriage of vaccine serotypes has been shown to reduce IPD in adults in the USA due to herd immunity so the population benefit in an influenza pandemic may extend beyond protection just of immunised children. Herd immunity has also recently been shown to protect young un-immunised infants from IPD. Conjugate vaccine has had little impact on all cause otitis media in randomised trials, but post-marketing studies in the USA suggest that healthcare utilisation for otitis episodes has reduced significantly post vaccine introduction suggesting a major role for herd immunity and allowing physicians to feel more comfortable in a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude to otitis once the prospects of significant complications due to the pneumococcus are likely to be rare. The conjugation of pneumococcal polysaccharides to Haemophilus influenzae protein D has allowed the development of a more efficacious vaccine against otitis media. There has been a dramatic reduction in antibiotic resistance among vaccine serotypes causing IPD in the USA, in both children and adults, but resistance, driven by continuing high levels of antibiotic use, is now selecting resistance in non-vaccine serotypes. In particular, multiresistant global clones of serotype 19A are now dominant in the USA and a 13-valent vaccine formulation including serotype 19A is under development. The implementation of immunisation programmes including conjugate pneumococcal vaccine to infants in European countries affords the opportunity to monitor the impact on all of these health outcomes in both children and adults.",

Tetracyclines were already introduced 50 years ago but have undergone a considerable resistance development in nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. In June 2005, a minocycline derivative, the new glycylcycline antimicrobial tygecycline, was approved by the FDA for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Tigecycline, a bacteriostatic agent, binds to the 30S ribosome unit, blocks entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules, and prevents protein synthesis; it has a broad antibacterial spectrum with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including multidrug-resistant organisms and anaerobes. The modification of the basic tetracycline molecule has overcome the two resistance mechanisms seen with tetracyclines (efflux, ribosome protection). Tigecycline exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, has a long half-life (24\u201348 hours), is highly protein bound (71\u201389%), and has a large volume of distribution (7\u20139 L/kg).",

Florfenicol has followed chloramphenicol in veterinary medicine. The potential for florfenicol to cause blood dyscrasias, such as aplastic anaemia, in humans was discussed in relation to the chemically related chemicals chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Human epidemiological data could not be used to demonstrate the safety of florfenicol as florfenicol has never been used in human medicine.

The future of chloramphenicol is not entirely certain. On one hand, it is a well-studied, long-standing treatment for fighting a number of different infections; it is also very inexpensive and consequently has very widespread use. It would, however, be a very good thing if we could find a new drug or group of drugs that produced similar results in fighting infection but did not have as many serious side effects.

Recent research examining whether antiviral prophylaxis and social distance measures could be used to contain a nascent pandemic at its point of origin will then be reviewed. Containment is potentially feasible, but requires rapid detection of the initial transmissible case cluster and a rapid and organised response to each new case. These may be demanding criteria for much of SE Asia. If containment fails, slowing spread becomes a policy priority and in that context I will discuss the potential impact of restrictions on international travel. To conclude, I will discuss pandemic mitigation strategies which make best use of limited vaccine and antiviral supplies.",

The broad introduction of monoclonal antibodies to CD20 and CD52 and of nucleoside analogs into the treatment of patients with B- or T-cell lymphomas has lead to long-term depletion of B cells, eventually associated with decreasing levels of serum immunoglobulins, and T-cell deficiency lasting for many years.

            "text": "A large proportion of new cases of tuberculosis (TB) in the world arise from a reservoir of people latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In TB endemic areas of the world, the average time to diagnosis a case of TB after the onset of active disease is 6 months. During these 6 months, such a case of TB is likely to infect, on the average, 10 close contacts. If one of these 10 newly infected contacts then develops TB sometime in his life time, he will infect 10 other persons before diagnosis. The cycle then repeats itself. Thus, if a TB control programme is only focused on the treatment of active cases, TB will never come under control. The fundamental question in TB control, therefore, is \u201ccan we predict who among the latently infected people will progress to active disease so that such a person can be given preventive treatment?\u201d To answer this question, the mechanism of Mtb persistence and reactivation needs to be better understood. A variety of models for bacterial persistence has been proposed recently. Most genetic studies that provide evidence for the putative role of a gene in persistence are based on demonstrating that an Mtb strain disrupted in such a gene is attenuated in an animal model of TB. However, several recent gene disruption studies have shown that Mtb mutants can also become hypervirulent in an animal model. This suggests that some Mtb genes may actually help to temper the virulence potential of Mtb so that the organism can establish a stable niche in a host without harming the host. We provide evidence that a cluster of genes in an operon called mce1 in Mtb is involved in lipid transport and metabolism that helps to remodel the bacterial cell envelope. The operon appears to respond to a signal induced by the host's granuloma cell turnover, while the host's proinflammatory cells that comprise the granulomas appear to respond to the changing bacterial cell envelope lipid turnover. An Mtb mutant disrupted in the mce1 operon becomes hypervirulent in a mouse model of TB; it is unable to induce well-organised granulomas in mouse lungs, and the mouse dies from an uncontrolled bacterial proliferation. This mutant accumulates free mycolic acids on its surface. On the other hand, an Mtb strain disrupted in the negative regulator of the operon (mce1R) constitutively expresses the mce1 genes in vivo. This mutant is also hypervirulent but for an opposite reason-it causes rapidly progressive, hyper-proinflammatory response. Thus, the mce1 operon appears to serve as a homeostatic regulator of pro-inflammatory response by the host, helping to establish a balanced relationship favourable to both the host and Mtb. Understanding and exploiting this relationship may lead to new ways to predict a subset of latently infected people who progresses to active disease; it may also lead to the development of a therapeutic vaccine to prevent latently infected people from ever developing TB.",

However, TB is everywhere and there is no country in the world that has eliminated it or is near elimination. The HIV epidemic has fuelled TB incidence in many settings, especially in Africa. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is particularly frequent in the former USSR and in China (up to 14% of all new cases), and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has emerged in all continents and caused major concern in South Africa, where it has appeared among persons living with HIV/AIDS.

First of all, DOTS (the 5-element essential strategy promoted by WHO since 1995) needs to be fully implemented everywhere and of high quality, so that diagnosis, treatment and monitoring can be guaranteed in all settings and for all patients, and the operational targets of at least 70% case detection and 85% cure can be achieved. Second, the association of TB and HIV and the emergence of severe drug resistance require specific policies and interventions in most countries. Third, general health systems and services, especially at primary care level, must be robust enough to allow TB control and care practices to be effective; hence, national TB programmes need to engage in the broad discussion on health system strengthening and contribute to it. Fourth, it is clear that in most settings in 2007, many non-state sector practitioners or some public practitioners not linked with national programmes, are delivering sub-standard TB care. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that they are fully engaged in sound care delivery. Fifth, communities are playing an increasingly important role in contributing to their health; however, too few are adequately informed on TB and active in its care and control, thus losing an opportunity to mobilise more resources and increase political commitment at all levels. Finally, research is still badly under-funded and too slow in delivering new tools that could radically improve current practices in diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

Our collection contained an extraordinary diversity of strains in terms of genome content, including internationally well-known isolates. Fifty-eight percent (n = 92) of strains contained one important toxin. A large proportion harboured a SCCmec IV (n = 75) or V cassette (n = 7). The most important clusters were composed of PVL positive ST80 (n = 39), ST5 containing PVL or TSST (n = 15) and ST88 harbouring the exfoliatin A (n = 10). A homogeneous cluster of PVL positive, gentamicin-resistant strains (ST152 MRSA V) was found in 5 patients from Kosovo. Other strains showed previously uncharacterised genome contents (e.g. PVL negative ST1-MRSA-V) or profiles rarely observed in Europe (ST59 MRSA-IV or ST8-MRSA-IV). Several unusual clusters were detected, including one cluster in neonatology (PVL positive strain ST5 MRSA-IV) and transmission between 2 prison inmates (ST8 MRSA-IV).

            "text": "Multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii strains that infect hospitalised patients are among the most dreadful nosocomial bacteria in European and US hospitals. Evidence from banding pattern typing methods (AFLP and ribotyping) suggested that three clones are responsible for a majority of hospital outbreaks caused by MDR strains in European hospitals (Dijkshoorn et al., 1996; Van Dessel et al., 2004). These three pan-European clones were recently shown to be responsible for more than 60% of MDR A. baumannii infections in a US hospital (Hujer et al., 2006). Precise identification of strains belonging to clones I to III is therefore crucial for infection control and patient management. However, banding-pattern methods are difficult to standardise and provide limited information on phylogenetic relationships among strains. Using MLST, i.e. sequencing of internal portions of seven housekeeping genes (total 2,976 nt), we analysed a set of 155 strains of A. baumannii, including 80 strains belonging to clones I, II and III and 75 other strains representing the breadth of known AFLP diversity. A total of 59 distinct sequence types (STs) were found. Phylogenetic analysis based on allelic profiles revealed that strains from clones I, II and III fell into three unrelated clonal complexes, each made of a central, predominant genotype and a few (one to four) single locus variants. The only exception was one double-locus variant strain of clone III. Interestingly, the 75 strains from the AFLP diversity set had at least three distinct loci when compared to members of the MDR clones. We conclude that each of the three major clones can readily be demarcated from other A. baumannii members, and that molecular diagnostics could be developed to identify them rapidly. Analysis of the recombination/mutation rate shows that nucleotides do not change by recombination more frequently than by mutation, showing that recombination is unlikely to disrupt the clonal frame of the clones, which can therefore be expected to be stable over very long periods of time.",

The second criterion for selecting an antibiotic is due to its pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics, since it has been demonstrated that antibiotic concentrations at the infection site influence the intensity and duration of the effect, and together with the PD parameters, provide a general inter-relationship and contribute to defining the potential clinical efficacy of a drug. Pharmacodynamics have been upgraded in the last 10 years with in vitro and animal models which have helped to identify fairly precise correlations with therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. Moreover, the principles that link concentrations of antibiotics in humans and their effects have been outlined in order to determine the optimal dosing interval. Antimicrobial drugs with a concentration-dependent activity, i.e. the newer quinolones and aminoglycosides, should be administered as a single daily dose to maximise the peak serum concentration/MIC ratio. AUC/MIC ratio is also an important parameter for PK/PD correlations. Existing data on fluoroquinolones suggest that a ratio of 100\u2013125 correlates with high bacterial eradication and optimal clinical outcome in infections due to Gram-negative pathogens, while a ratio of 50 is associated with a high probability of eradication of S. pneumoniae strains. For this group of antibiotics the new concept of the so called mutant prevention concentration (MPC) and mutant selection window (MSW) may be helpful in restricting the enrichment of mutant subpopulations and consequently, at least partially, in controlling the spread of resistance. Beta-lactams, having time-dependent efficacy, usually do not have great post antibiotic effects (PAEs), and the parameter which seems to better correlate PD with PK is the time duration with concentrations higher than the MIC (T > MIC). These antibiotics need to be given with short dosing intervals or even by continuous infusion to maintain plasma levels exceeding the MIC for a sufficiently long period.",

            "text": "Antibiotics are the most commonly purchased class of drugs in low-resource countries, where the infectious diseases are extremely frequent and the bacterial infections are the major cause of death, especially in childhood. The phenomenon of microbial drug resistance, which represents a global public health problem, is particularly serious in these countries, as resistance rates are even higher than in industrialised countries and the therapeutic options are often unavailable or too expensive. Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility is a key element to provide updated information on the magnitude and trends in resistance, and to plan and monitor intervention strategies aimed at preserving the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. In low-resource countries, effective surveillance programmes are difficult to implement for a number of reasons, including scarce financial resources, lack of laboratory facilities and, where laboratories do exist, lack of quality control, reliable reagents and adequate supervision. In these settings, the development of reliable and low-cost alternative methods could facilitate the implementation of large-scale surveillance. There is an increasing agreement about the importance of extending the surveillance of antibiotic resistance to the commensal microbiota of humans and animals. This bacterial population, although not being a specific target, is continuously exposed to the selective pressure generated by antimicrobial chemotherapy and may become a potential reservoir of resistant strains that can cause infections, and of resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by healthy individuals is considered an indicator of the spread of antibiotic resistance that could also be useful to predict the emergence of resistance in pathogenic bacteria. In this perspective, resistance patterns of some members of the commensal microbiota, such as the faecal Escherichia coli, have been evaluated in various epidemiological settings. For this purpose, different microbiological approaches have been implemented and evaluated as useful tools to conduct large scale resistance surveillance studies and to monitor resistance control programmes in a cost-effective manner.",

Soon after their discovery, phenotypic methods were developed for their detection and confirmation. Confirmation depended largely on the ability of clavulanate to inhibit the main culprit enzymes at the time, the TEM and SHV variants. Later this technique proved reliable for CTX-M type enzymes. Many susceptibility testing methods recommended the use of ESBL screening and confirmation tests on a routine basis, including CLSI, BSAC, CA-SFM, and SRGA. However, a number of issues have emerged with routine use over the years:\n1The problem of defining an adequate number of substrates to ensure sufficiently sensitive screening. Ideally, one should include a minimum of 4, namely cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, and aztreonam, and at concentrations that often differ from those used for susceptibility breakpoints.2The lack of reliable phenotypic methods to detect ESBLs in species with inducible AmpC \u03b2-lactamases. Some of these species have been shown to be important reservoirs for ESBLs, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins cannot solely attributed to stable de-repression of AmpC.3The failure of current methods to provide advice on the interpretation of a positive screening test but a negative confirmation test, especially if the isolates are \u201csusceptible\u201d to extended-spectrum cephalosporins using method-recommended breakpoints. Such strains have been shown to harbour OXA enzymes, inhibitor-resistant TEM enzymes, or particularly plasmid-borne AmpC enzymes with significant frequency. Thus there is no current phenotypic or genotypic test that can be practically and effectively applied in the routine laboratory with sufficient sensitivity to detect the emerging range of transmissible enzymes.\n",

Further, application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles to the most widely recommended dosing schedules of cephalosporins suggest that the susceptibility breakpoints recommended by many methods are too high, and should to lowered to values that fortunately coincide wild-type cut-off values. Hence, lowering of susceptibility breakpoints for extended-spectrum cephalosporins to those defined by PK/PD will indicate the presence of an ESBL or plasmid-borne AmpC enzyme with sufficiently high likelihood to allow laboratories to report both resistance to these agents and provide advice about appropriate infection control procedures.",

Three key properties of this antigen are that it is highly immunogenic, it is not found in BCG or many environmental mycobacteria, and it is a key virulence factor. Its immunogenicity and specificity led to a series of studies to assess its potential as a major component of new diagnostic tests. Such tests have evolved into two major forms-a whole blood assay marketed under the name Quantiferon and an ELISPOT assay marketed under the name T-spot. New antigens have been assessed for improved test performance, most notably CFP-10. Studies of in-house versions of these assays, and more recently the commercial kits, have shown encouraging results in TB cases for the diagnosis of disease and in their close contacts for the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection. It is clear that these tests are not confounded by prior BCG vaccination and are probably not subject to boosting by injected tuberculin. Their quantitative readouts may also provide important information with respect to infectious load. However, some findings have caused concern: disparity in test performance between temperate non-TB endemic and tropical TB-endemic settings, evidence of relatively poor sensitivity to the presence of certain M. tuberculosis strains (eg. M. africanum) and in certain sub-groups (eg. Pulmonary TB, certain TB contacts), and rapid unexplained test reversion. It is therefore becoming clear that T cell assays may have a niche in the diagnosis of certain TB cases and in certain individuals suspected of having M. tuberculosis infection, but this niche has not yet been fully defined. More longitudinal studies, especially following TB case contacts for the development of disease, are indicated. Also more studies should be undertaken in TB endemic areas. Finally, if these tests are to have any role in TB control globally they would need to be much cheaper and more easy to use. Some advances with respect to these two issues have already taken place.",

It is expected, that integrase inhibitors and CCR5- antagonists will be introduced into clinical practice in 2007/2008. Both of these drug classes have been first studied in heavily treatment experienced patients having failed NRTI, NNRTI and PI therapy. In preliminary analyses the integrase inhibitor MK-0518 combined with optimised background treatment (OBT) has shown clinical superiority over OBT alone.

Current antiretroviral regimens however cannot achieve virus eradication and virological rebound virtually always occurs after therapy discontinuation. Long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is life saving, but poses several challenges. Potential adverse events can be categorised as problems related to adherence, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and drug resistance. Various interventions have been explored to improve and maintain good adherence among treated individuals, ranging from treatment simplification strategies to addressing mental health problems, and a major challenge is related to the need for integrated biomedical, social and behavioural interventions. Inadequate adherence however accounts for only a subset of sub-therapeutic drug levels in clinical practice. There is a significant degree of inter-individual variability in absorption, metabolism and cellular transport of antiretroviral drugs, with potential impact on both efficacy and toxicity of therapy. Important determinants include gender, age, ethnic origin, and genetic polymorphisms. Although evidence of the influence of pharmacogenomics is growing, there remain limited data to guide clinical practice. Proton pump inhibitors are an example of commonly prescribed medications that can affect antiretroviral drug levels by reducing the absorption of certain protease inhibitors (PIs) and increasing exposure to others. Herbal medicines such as St. John's wort, widely used by HIV patients, also have the potential to interact with antiretroviral drugs.

Immunocompetent and non-atopic subjects are relatively resistant to A. fumigatus diseases and disease occurs in the setting of host damage. The inherent resistance to diseases caused by A. fumigatus suggests the occurrence of regulatory mechanisms that provide the host with adequate defence without necessarily eliminating the fungus or causing unacceptable levels of host damage. Respiratory tolerance is mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells producing IL-10 and inducing the development of CD4+ T regulatory cells expressing FoxP3 and regulating inflammation and allergy through the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-dependent pathway. Thus, the IDO-dependent pathway has a unique e central role in this process as it participates in the effector and inductive phases of immunity and tolerance to the fungus.",

Some of these immunomodulators are present only within infected cells and inhibit signalling pathways induced by ligand engagement of cytokine, interferon or toll like receptors. Other molecules inhibit pathways leading to the induction of apoptosis.

The initially asymptomatic liver disease is still rare in Central Europe, and diagnosis is often made at a late stage of the disease. An anatomical classification system has been used (PNM adapted from the TNM system of tumours), allowing now a comparison of the disorder at the time of first diagnosis in different clinical settings. New foci have been discovered in China/Tibet with a prevalence rate of up to 4% of the affected population. Imaging techniques, such as Ultrasound, CT, MRI and PET/CT contributed to a much better description of the lesions. However, the expertise of the radiologist is often not available due to the low incidence of AE. Serology is helpful, but may be misleading due to non-standardised tests. Molecular tools have been developed, and help histopathologists to clearly separate the two bugs by microscopy. Radical surgery is curative and the first choice of treatment.

Based on molecular markers the species of E. granulosus was recently further subdivided according to its main intermediate host in E. granulosus, E. ortleppi, E. equinus, E. intermedius. In contrast to AE, the larva forms a single or several fluid-filled cyst(s), and induces a well-organised, compact capsule of host origin. Serological diagnosis of the disease in humans is still unsatisfactory, since young and unruptured cysts remain serologically negative. The recently established WHO Classification of hepatic cysts has much improved the clinical management. Experiences with the PAIR/PEVAC procedure are encouraging, and have shown to be safe for hepatic hydatids. Surgery is not anymore the treatment of choice. Instead many centres apply short term cycles of benzimidazoles which act parasitocidal and accelerate the degeneration of the cyst. Others favour the Watch and Wait concept, and carefully observe the natural degeneration of the cyst(s).",

Wolbachia, endosymbiotic bacteria that are found in most of the human filarial worms are excellent targets for the discovery of new antifilarial drugs because of their requirement for worm embryogenesis, development and adult survival. In both lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, administration of 6 weeks of doxycline at a dose of 200 mg/day results in a high macrofilaricidal effect of over 80% and 70%, respectively.

Evidence that eliminating the endobacteria reduces adverse reactions to current drug therapies and even reduces early stages of lymphatic pathology is also accruing.

The third assay targeting blaCTX-M genes utilised melting curve analysis with SYBR Green I to distinguish the members of CTX-M-1, \u22122, \u22128, and \u22129 clusters according to melting temperatures of PCR products generated with nested set of primers. Strains producing penicillinases SHV-1, TEM-1, SHV ESBLs with aa substitutions 146(V), 149(S), 156(D), 179(A,G,N), 238(A,S), 240(K), TEM ESBLs with aa substitutions 104(K), 164(C,H,S), 237(T), 238(S), 240(K) and CTX-M enzymes (\u20132, \u22123, \u22125, \u22128, \u22129, \u221214, \u221215) representing all four clusters were used as controls.

In children, the majority of bacterial RTIs are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pnc), Haemophilus influenzae (mostly nontypeable, NTHi) or both. In AOM, NTHi and Pnc are equally common. Pnc is slightly more \u2018aggressive\u2019 than NTHi (i.e. higher temperature, higher polymorphonuclear counts and complications are more frequent), but NTHi can still cause significant disease. The role of NTHi in recurrent and non-responsive AOM in both infants and in older children is recognized, suggesting different biological pathways compared with Pnc. In both acute and subacute sinusitis, NTHi is found as commonly as Pnc. NTHi is the most common causative agent of conjunctivitis and the most significant in relation to the co-presence of AOM and systemic symptoms and signs. The role of NTHi in LRIs in general, and in pneumonia in particular, is not yet clear. In cystic fibrosis, however, NTHi is an important pathogen. Although H. influenzae type b disease has practically been eliminated in vaccinated populations, the picture with S. pneumoniae in the 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV7) era is much more complex owing to its limited serotype coverage and some replacement with non-vaccine serotypes. A vaccine with additional pneumococcal serotypes and activity against NTHi would be a very welcome addition to our vaccine armamentarium.",

OM is caused by the synergistic interaction between upper respiratory tract viruses and three predominant bacterial species, all of which are members of the commensal flora of the paediatric nasopharynx. Despite their similar roles as opportunistic pathogens of the middle ear, the pathogenic mechanisms utilised by these bacteria (nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis) are unique. Thus, to date, most laboratories have investigated the pathogenesis and prevention of disease caused by these microbes individually. Recently, it has become appreciated that OM, and particularly chronic and recurrent OM, is a disease that includes a biofilm component. By definition, bacteria resident within a biofilm community are inherently resistant to eradication due to their significantly enhanced ability to resist the action of antibodies as well as antibiotics. Moreover, residence within a biofilm promotes the bacterial exchange of DNA, which confers resistance to antibiotics, and induces a markedly reduced bacterial growth rate that commonly results in false-negative bacterial cultures.",

This enhanced understanding of the biofilm component of middle ear infections is greatly influencing the current approaches to both the management of OM and the design of novel strategies to treat, or better to prevent, OM. It is particularly intriguing that some of the paediatric middle ear mucosa-derived biofilms characterised were of mixed bacterial aetiology, suggesting that progress made on single-microbe directed strategies for the treatment and/or prevention of OM, while highly encouraging, are also likely to be inadequate. Therefore, a significantly greater understanding of how microbial physiology relates to the involvement of biofilms in OM is required to identify points in the disease course that are perhaps more amenable to treatment strategies, and also biofilm-relevant antigenic targets that would be helpful in the rational design of vaccine candidates to prevent OM.",

Minimal inhibition concentrations (MIC) of metronidazole, vancomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and tetracycline were determined using the Etest method. Epidemic 027 strain was identified by PCR-ribotyping. Of 406 strains, 349 were toxigenic of which 89 (25.5%) were toxin variant strains. Major toxinotypes included toxinotype 0 (n = 260), V (n = 27), VIII (n = 22) and III (n = 22). Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and tetracycline was found in 45.8%, 50.6%, 9.1% and 33.7%, respectively. All the strains were fully susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. Resistance to moxifloxacin and erythromycin was tightly associated and MICs of moxifloxacin were significantly higher in patients previously treated with fluoroquinolones. Prevalence of the 027 epidemic strain was 5.7%. It was found in Ireland (n = 1), Netherlands (n = 8) and Belgium (n = 11). This strain exhibits the same phenotypic and genotypic features as the NAP1 clone described in North America: it is positive for binary toxin genes, it has an18-bp deletion in tcdC gene and it is resistant to erythromycin and moxifloxacin.

            "text": "\nClostridium difficile is an anaerobic bacterium capable of forming spores which confer resistance to heating, drying and chemical agents, including disinfectants. Spores of CD may survive in the environment for long periods and are resistant to alcohol. More than 150 PCR ribotypes and 24 toxinotypes have been recognized; epidemic ribotypes may have enhanced sporulation. The spectrum of C. difficile-associated disease ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant, relapsing and potentially fatal colitis. Since 2003, increasing rates of CDAD have been reported in North America and Europe involving a more severe course, higher mortality, increased risk of relapse and more complications. The outbreaks are difficult to control and require a multifaceted approach. The most important infection control measures act on interruption of transmission of spores to vulnerable patients from infected patients and from the environment. Vulnerable patients are mainly patients who receive antimicrobial treatment, and therefore fewer antibiotic prescriptions should lead to less vulnerable patients. At present, no sufficient evidence exists to propagate the use of probiotics to vulnerable patients for prevention of CDAD. Transmission of spores occurs mainly via contact of contaminated healthcare workers to patients, directly by patient-to-patient transmission or by transmission from the contaminated environment to patients. There is no evidence that patients or healthcare workers who are symptom-free but colonised with C. difficile in the intestinal tract are significant sources of infection. Airborne transmission of infection is unlikely to occur based on recent reviews of the literature. Early diagnosis of CDAD, prompt isolation of symptomatic patients and reducing antimicrobial treatment are essential first steps. The infection control measures include recommendations to isolate infected patient on a single room with designated toilet, to apply proper hand hygiene with soap and water, to use appropriate protective clothing (gloves and aprons or gowns), to intensify environmental cleaning with a chlorine containing disinfectant and to take specific precautions for the use of devices (disposable or dedicated to individual patient). Patient isolation must continue at least until diarrhoea has ceased. Each hospital should have an appropriate surveillance system to recognize an increase of the incidence of CDAD in an early stage. All infection control measures should be written in a local protocol so that additional measures can be carried out as soon as a problem with CDAD arises. When outbreaks occur, additional recommendations include a reinforcement of general and hand washing measures, intensifying of testing patients with diarrhoea for C. difficile, reinforcement of environmental cleaning, information and education of healthcare workers, cleaning department and visitors, cohorting of infected patients, and eventually closure of the unit followed by intensive environmental cleaning. Restricted antibiotic prescribing is also highly recommended to reduce polypharmacy and duration of administration. Second and third generations cephalosporins, clindamycin and more recently fluoroquinolones have been identified as potential risk factors. Although some hospitals report successes for enhanced environmental cleaning with potentially effective agents such as hydrogen peroxide vapour, the evidence is too scarce to consider this as an evidence-based approach.",

The recent EU-funded ARPAC study revealed that 130 of 169 participating European hospitals in 32 European countries had encountered carbapenem-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter, ranging from very rare sporadic resistant isolates to an endemic/epidemic situation. Certain multiresistant epidemic clones are currently spreading worldwide, and epidemics of multiresistant A. baumannii infections have occurred following the repatriation of casualties from the recent wars in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan to European and American hospitals. In general, multiple isolates from a single hospital usually belong to the same clone, but some hospitals yield isolates belonging to more than one clone. Three \u2018European Clones\u2019 (lineages) have been identified in hospitals throughout Europe, but numerous other, more localised, clones have also been characterised, showing that the problem of A. baumannii is not confined solely to the widespread \u2018European clones I, II and III'.

These resistance mechanisms may involve most of the antibiotic molecules, i.e. aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Rate and spread of specific mechanisms of resistance depends on each country. A similar trend between the number of A. baumannii infections and antibiotic resistance may be observed worldwide. Acquired resistance genes are located on chromosome, plasmids, insertions sequences, transposons, integrons, and the recently described resistance island. One of the most worrying antibiotic resistance problems in A. baumannii is the increasing trend of carbapenem resistance since carbapenems are often used as antibiotics of the last resort.

Two weeks after surgery, a purulent discharge from the post-operative wound was noted, and MRSA was cultured from swabs. The strain was resistant to oxacillin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and susceptible to ofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pristinamycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, and was intermediate to fusidic acid. He was given oral pristinamycin (1 g tid for 8 weeks). One week after the end of treatment, in October 2006, he was admitted for a right acromioclavicular osteoarthritis which required surgical debridement and intravenous vancomycin treatment. A C-MRSA strain PVL\u2013 tsst1+ grew from intra-operative samples. The family carriage screening (including the pt) showed that the pt's children were colonised with the same MRSA strain according to the antibiotic susceptibility profile (PVL and tsst 1 detection still in process).

Questionnaires, information sheets and consent forms were then sent to the relevant clinicians/consultants by post. All completed forms and questionnaires were returned to HPS and entered into a database for statistical analyses. From 2003 to October 2006, 145 reports of thrombotic microangiopathy were notified to HPS of which 103 were clinically designated HUS and 42 as TTP. There were 10 fatalities, 22 cases had some form of renal impairment and of those, 14 became dialysis dependent. Of 103 reports of HUS, 85 (83%) were caused by verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) (82 were due to serotype O157). The non-O157 organisms were designated as serotypes O145, O177 and O-unidentifiable. Two atypical HUS cases were reported. One was preceded by parvovirus B19 infection/MMR immunisation and the other was due to infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The list of predisposing infections for development of TTP was more varied and included infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Clostridium difficile but development of TTP was significantly associated with severe sepsis. The study clearly demonstrates that development of HUS or TTP has serious and sometimes fatal consequences and that infection is a major predisposing factor in development of such syndromes.",

Integration of population PK, a PD target, and microbiologic surveillance data by Monte Carlo simulations can generate an empirical dosing strategy that maximises the likelihood that an antibiotic regimen achieves the desired PD end point (exposure target).

The T cell system comprises distinct populations. CD4 T cells are undoubtedly of central importance for acquired resistance against tuberculosis. Antigens of M. tuberculosis also stimulate CD8 T cells, probably through crosspriming. In addition, unconventional T cells also seem to participate in immunity against tuberculosis. What can we learn for rational vaccine design? Novel vaccination strategies either focus on subunit vaccines or viable attenuated vaccines. Subunit vaccination strategies are based on the assumption that one or few antigens suffice for an efficient immune response. Hence, the identification of protective antigens represents an essential prerequisite for the success of this type of vaccines. Subunit vaccines come in three forms: Protein/adjuvant formulations, recombinant heterologous carriers or naked DNA constructs. Viable attenuated vaccines are based on the assumption that multiple antigens are required for efficacious protection. Two major strategies are being pursued: Knockout mutants of M. tuberculosis and improved recombinant (r)-BCG vaccines. Improved r-BCG should first be endowed with a higher immunogenicity and second may need a broader antigenic repertoire. Rational vaccination strategies performed in the laboratory of the author focus on improved BCG. A r-BCG strain which expresses listeriolysin induces better protection than wild-type BCG. It is tempting to speculate that a prime/boost scheme comprising prime with improved r-BCG and boost with the most efficacious subunit vaccine candidate will provide optimal protection. Identification of a biosignature that allows distinction between infection/protection and infection/disease in tuberculosis could speed up efficacy testing of vaccines in clinical trials. The Grand Challenge 6 of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation aims at identifying such biosignatures.",

            "text": "One of the most important characteristics that separate antimicrobials from other drugs used in clinical medicine is that their target (the receptor of the drug) is part of the microbe, and not of men. The activity of the antimicrobial can therefore be studied both in vitro and in model systems, such as animal models, and a relationship between exposure and effect established. The exposure is primarily determined by the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug, while the effect is determined by the concentration\u2013effect relationship of the antimicrobial and the micro-organism. However, in most clinical settings, it is the potency of the antimicrobial that is measured in terms of the MIC and not the concentration\u2013effect relationship itself. Therefore, a relationship needs to be ascertained between the MIC, exposure of the drug and effect. Over the last decade, these pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of antimicrobials have been established for most classes of drugs. The two major indices describing these relationships are the time the concentration of the antimicrobial remains above the MIC (T >MIC) as a fraction of the dosing interval and the Area under the Time Concentration curve over 24 hours divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio). The Peak/MIC ratio correlates with effect for a number of drugs, but it in many, if not all, cases the effect can not be clearly distinguished from the AUC/MIC effect. Importantly, for virtually all antimicrobials, it is the exposure of the free non-protein bound fraction of the drug that best correlates with efficacy, and is of particular significance when drugs are compared with each other within a class and/or across species, including men.",

Importantly, it has been shown in a number of clinical trials \u2013 now exceeding 10 \u2013 including several classes of drugs, that the PK/PD relationships that do exist in animals are, as expected, similar to those in men. Moreover, it has been shown that the quantitative relationships are remarkably similar. In other words, exposures in infected animals result in the same effect as exposures in infected humans under similar conditions. A second, perhaps even more important topic is that these relationships \u2013 once well established \u2013 can be used to optimise therapy in patients by optimising exposure of the drug. In a relatively simple approach, these relationships are used in daily clinical practice in the use of clinical breakpoints. These MIC values are used to discriminate between high and low probabilities of successful outcome of treatment (S and R, respectively) based on the PK/PD relationships of the antimicrobial together with the clinical setting. For instance, lower exposures to obtain the same effect are needed in the immunocompetent host because of the contribution of the immune system. More sophisticated, these relationships are used to adjust dosing regimens once the MICs of the infectious micro-organisms are known, and thus provide an integrated approach to the individual patient. Finally, PK/PD relationships are used in the development phase of the drug in determining the optimal dose for the indication sought. Alternatively, once dosing regimens are established, they can be used to form an opinion on the possible indications for various clinical treatment modalities.",

Results of studies on antibiotic resistance in settings of minimal antibiotic exposure (including investigations recently carried out in very remote human communities living in the Bolivian Chaco and in the Alto Amazonas jungle of South America, and among wild reptiles (land iguanas) from a remote and protected island of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago with no documented sources of antibiotic exposure and minimum human contacts) will be critically reviewed in this presentation, and the mechanisms potentially involved in the dissemination of resistant strains and resistance genes unrelated to antimicrobial consumption will be discussed. Results from the characterisation of resistance determinants carried by bacterial isolates from these settings pointed to their likely origin from antibiotic-exposed areas rather than to a local and independent resistance selection process. However, the mechanisms responsible for this flow of resistance genes and for their maintenance and spread in absence of sustained antibiotic use remain elusive.",

For vancomycin, both VITEK2 and Phoenix evidenced MIC values \u226516 ug/mL in 25 strains, agreed in three susceptible strains, while in two cases they showed discordant results. The E-test showed MIC values for vancomycin \u226516 ug/mL in 22 strains, in six isolates displayed results discordant with the automated systems, while agreed in two cases of susceptible strains. In all instances but one, the three methods agreed in the susceptibility testing for linezolid.

In that species, most of the mechanisms involved in the \u03b2-lactam resistance are linked to the production of \u03b2-lactamases, including clavulanic-acid inhibited expanded-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases which are the most powerful enzymes able to degradate most \u03b2-lactams. Besides the most common ESBLs circulating in Enterobacteriaceae (TEM-, SHV, and CTX-M-types), there are other emerging enzymes which are mostly plasmid-encoded and are distributed in a large variety of species. The ESBL VEB-1 is known to be largerly distributed in South-East Asia, PER-1 in Turkey, Italy, Korea, and also South America, and GES/IBC-type enzymes in Greece and Japan mostly. All these ESBLs are known to efficiently hydrolyze expanded-spectrum \u03b2-lactams, and some variants of the GES family are also hydrolysing imipenem at a low level. Other enzymes of the KPC family have been also reported in E. coli. KPC-2 has been shown to be prevalent in E. coli in Israel and KPC-3 has been reportyed sporadically in the USA. These latter enzymes are considered as ESBLs since they are inhibited by clavulanic acid and their hydrolytic efficiencies toward imipenem are very high, thus giving rise to high level resistance to carbapenems in those E. coli isolates.",

The wild type M. tuberculosis strain (Mt-wt), choD-mutant (mut-choD) and mutant complemented with choD gene controlled by a heat shock protein promoter (mut-choD-PhspchoD) were used to study the function of cholesterol oxidase in mycobacterial pathogenesis. Peritoneal macrophages (106/well) were infected with Mt-wt, mut-choD and mut-choD-PhspchoD M. tuberculosis strains (105/well) and incubated for four and six days. The numbers of Mt-wt and mut-choD-PhspchoD viable bacteria recovered from macrophages were at least an order of magnitude higher compared to mut-cho strain as revealed by cfu analysis. The same strains were used for infection of mice. Ten weeks post infection, lungs and spleens were isolated from euthanised mice. The numbers of viable bacteria in each organ were detected by cfu. Analysing at least 10 mice of each group, the strong attenuation of choD mutants was observed compared to wild type and complementation strains.",

Surprisingly, about 12% of genes are CV, their presence, absence or variabity can be used to classify an isolate into one of about ten human lineages. This classification matches well with multilocus sequence typing clonal complexes. Many CV genes are regulators of virulence genes, or known or predicted to be expressed on the bacterial surface and to interact with the host during nasal colonisation and infection. Since each lineage carries a unique combination of CV genes scattered throughout the chromosome, there was likely to be a common S. aureus ancestor but early evolutionary divergence of lineages, with possible selection in the nose. MGE often carry key resistance and virulence genes, and show substantial variation within and between lineages, indicating frequent horizontal transfer. Interestingly, we have been unable to identify any markers that differ between carriage and typical invasive community isolates (not CA-MRSA), suggesting community-acquired invasive disease is strongly dependent on host factors.",

Over 75% of the antibacterial new chemical entities (NCEs) introduced worldwide between 1981 and 2002 were based on natural products. The unmatched chemical diversity and complexity of natural products is one reason for their success over those obtained by pure chemical synthesis. Another reason for their superiority can be explained by the fact that their synthesis evolved naturally in response to needs and challenges of the natural environment generating compounds which are pre-selected for activity. Despite these facts, natural product research has recently gone through a phase of reduced interest. Big pharmaceutical companies in particular have downgraded or even stopped this kind of research.

The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses, based on mathematical models.

Two distinct clusters of Klebsiella pneumoniae were seen following repetitive sequence PCR. The first cluster of 7 isolates was 86.0% identical suggesting a clonal expansion while the other 5 isolates were unrelated.

Proposed explanations are mainly: (1) the infection rates in the placebo groups were lower than anticipated. Therefore, the sample size was too low. (2) Due to the duration before the results of culture are available, carriers could not be identified before inclusion. Therefore both carriers and non-carriers were included resulting in a dilution of the effect. A systematic review was performed to determine the effect on the S. aureus infection rate of treating identified carriers of S. aureus with mupirocin nasal ointment. Only prospective and adequately controlled trials were included. The literature search resulted in eleven hits. Only three articles met the inclusion criteria. Among the 556 mupirocin-treated surgical patients with S. aureus nasal carriage there were 20 S. aureus infections (3.6%), as compared with 7.5% (42/559) in the controls (nasal carriers without mupirocin treatment) [p = 0.006; Number Needed to Treat (NNT)=25].

Human mortality from recently emerged diseases varies, ranging from less than 200 people thus far for H5N1 avian influenza to about 20 million for AIDS. Livestock production has been negatively affected by the direct mortality of animals from emerging infections and depopulation policies to protect the safety of international trade and to control the spread of pathogens. The environmental impact of emerging infections is of special concern for endangered wild animal populations, which can be pushed to the brink of extinction by such events. Animals, and particularly wild animals, are thought to be the source of more than 70% of all emerging infections (Philos Trans R Soc London B 356: 983). Understanding how some infectious agents have breached the barriers that normally limit this interspecies transmission is important. However, these barriers are poorly characterised. The host species barrier for infection can be defined as an interaction of factors that collectively limits the transmission of an infection from one host species (the donor species) to another (the recipient species) (Science 312: 394). Such limiting factors may occur at different levels, of which the functional components are organism, tissue, and cell. At the organism level, barriers limiting contact between two host species, and thus preventing transmission of an infection, may be geographical, environmental, or behavioural. Because of the rapid growth of both human populations and their consumption patterns, these barriers are often breached. Even if two host species share the same geographical area and habitat, pathogen transmission may not occur due to behavioural restrictions. At the tissue level, an emerging pathogen, in particular a virus, needs to gain access to the appropriate tissue or tissues in order to replicate. First it must invade the host through a portal of entry. It may then remain localised and replicate in a tissue near the original portal of entry, or may generate a systemic infection, using various pathways to spread to more distant target tissues in the host. Release of progeny virus from the infected host typically occurs through dissemination by respiratory, enteric, or urogenital secretions, or by an arthropod vector that has ingested blood from a viremic host. There are barriers at each stage of this process that may prevent the virus from developing a productive infection. At the cellular level, a virus needs to enter, replicate in, and exit from the appropriate cell type, simultaneously dealing with any host response to infection. Understanding how a pathogen is able to breach the constraints of the host species barrier and become established in a new host species will help us to detect and control the emergence of zoonotic infections.",

There are many different subtypes of influenza virus which are characterised according to two surface structures \u2013 the hemagglutinin (H1-H16) and neuraminidase (N1-N9). These subtypes have the ability to recombine, thereby creating new variants, for example H5N1. If a subtype that humans have not encountered starts to spread it can result in a pandemic. Pandemic outbreaks have occurred at irregular intervals and have had a devastating impact on mankind. The Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 is thought to have killed about 50 million people. In particular dabbling ducks are believed to constitute the main reservoir for influenza A virus. In ducks, the virus causes sub-clinical gastrointestinal infection. By a meta-analysis on all published screening data of wild birds and data from a four-year screening of ducks caught and sampled in Sweden we found that the prevalence of influenza A virus in the western Eurasian duck population shows a different temporal pattern compared to North America. The prevalence in western Eurasian ducks is high from August to December and also rises in the spring. These findings are of importance for the understanding of how influenza virus is perpetuated in nature. Of concern is the presence of H5 and H7 subtypes that are prone to change into highly pathogenic variants in poultry. Many of the strains isolated in our study are prototypes that have caused influenza outbreaks in poultry in Europe during recent years. This indicates that wild bird surveillance for influenza A virus can be of value as a sentinel system to prevent outbreaks in domestic poultry.",

Influenza A virus is the ultimate actor in this play where some subtypes may change into highly pathogenic forms. These may be transmitted directly to man. Another worrying scenario is that an avian influenza virus will reassort with a circulating human influenza. A genetic trait might then readily go from the human to the bird virus so that avian influenza acquires the capacity to pass from person to person. With this risk in mind, it would advisable to consider any method to reduce the probability of this happening.

The pandemic started in November 2002 in Guangdong, China and was brought under control in July 2003, after it had spread to 33 countries on 5 continents resulting in more than 8000 infections and close to 800 deaths. The outbreak was caused by a newly emerged coronavirus, now known as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A closely related virus was detected in masked palm civets from a live animal market in Guangdong during the outbreaks. In late 2003 and early 2004, sporadic outbreaks were reported in the same region of China where the 2002/3 outbreaks originated. This time, civets were identified as the direct source of the virus responsible for human infections. However, a large-scale survey in China failed to find any evidence of infection of farmed or wild civets with SARS-CoV. It appears that the infection of civets was limited to animals present in the live animal markets only. The role of civets as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was hence never confirmed. Molecular epidemiological studies revealed that the viruses responsible for the 2003/4 outbreaks were not the same as those isolated during the 2002/3 outbreaks, indicating independent species-crossing events. These findings indicate that a SARS epidemic may recur in the future and that SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like-CoVs) originating from different reservoir host populations may lead to epidemics at different times and in different regions depending on the distribution of the reservoirs and transmitting hosts. This notion was supported by the later discovery of a group of diverse SARS-like-CoVs in bats. At least five different SARS-like coronaviruses have been identified in different species of horseshoe bats in the genus Rhiolophus. Sequences of four complete genomes were determined and the overall nucleotide sequence identity between bat SARS-like coronaviruses and SARS-CoV was 87\u201392%. Although the exact host species for the SARS-CoV has not been identified, the great genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses highly suggests that a different horseshoe bat or a closely related bat species is the most likely natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreaks.",

This presentation summarises information regarding chiropteran characteristics and information regarding 66 viruses [at the time of preparation of this abstract] that have been isolated from bats.

CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) microdilution and disk diffusion methods as well as AFST-EUCAST (European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing \u2013 Antifungal Susceptibility Testing Subcommittee) microdilution reference methodology are the currently used standard assays. Recent progressions have further expanded the knowledge on application and clinical utility of AFST. Among these are validation of the previously documented CLSI fluconazole MIC breakpoints and dose-dependent susceptibility concept for fluconazole vs. Candida, and documentation of MIC breakpoints and disk diffusion inhibition zone interpretive parameters for voriconazole vs. Candida. The use of fluconazole susceptibility profile as a surrogate marker for prediction of voriconazole susceptibility has also been proposed recently. In addition, based on the modifications of the CLSI M38-A reference method, new guidelines for in vitro susceptibility testing of antifungal agents against Aspergillus spp. have been developed by AFST-EUCAST. A standard assay for testing antifungal agents against dermatophytes is also under development. Further investigations address the applicability of other methods, which are more practical and/or require shorter incubation periods. Among these are Etest, colorimetric methods, flow cytometry, and ergosterol quantitation. Utility of flow cytometry for AFST of yeasts and moulds is being currently studied and appears promising. Assessment of metabolic activity by using XTT colorimetric assay is also being investigated as a novel approach, particularly for determination of quantitative endpoints for testing caspofungin against Aspergillus, and for susceptibility testing of Zygomycetes. Despite these progressions, utility of AFST in direction of antifungal therapy and prediction of clinical outcome is still limited. While in vitro triazole (particularly fluconazole) susceptibility results for Candida appear to be optimally correlated with clinical outcome, data are either limited and investigational or fail to demonstrate any significant in vitro\u2013in vivo correlation for most of the remaining fungus\u2013antifungal drug combinations. Importantly and conclusively, the results obtained by AFST constitute one of the several factors that influence clinical outcome. Optimisation of test methodologies and parameters for routine use and expanded in vitro-in vivo correlation studies may further enhance the role of AFST as an adjunct in direction of antifungal therapy.",

The availability of a large number of antibiotics has allowed precise individualisation of resistance phenotypes, and enzyme inhibitors have provided clues concerning certain mechanisms of resistance. Detailed analysis of the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of antibiotics, alone or in combination, has indicated the limits of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility tests in the detection of resistance resulting in clinical failure. The goal of combined molecular and therapeutic interpretation of susceptibility tests is to provide an improved logical basis for decision-making in antibiotic therapy by taking into account the recent progress in the understanding of bacterial resistance. The molecular analysis and therapeutic interpretation, designated \u201cinterpretative reading\u201d, of the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests consists of three steps: (1) characterisation of the resistance phenotype with a judicious assortment of antibiotics belonging to the same class; (2) deduction from the observed phenotype of the corresponding biochemical mechanism of resistance; and (3) inference from the deduced mechanism of the predicted resistance phenotype. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests, like other tests in biology, should provide objective quantitative data, e.g. MICs. For various historical reasons, they also provide subjective interpretation of the data such as clinical categories. Interpretative reading of antimicrobial susceptibility tests is an attempt to reconcile these two notions by basing interpretation on the most recent knowledge in the field of antibiotic study, in particular that of mechanisms of resistance. The best that one can ask of antibiotic susceptibility testing is detection of resistance, in particular of low-level resistance. This can be achieved by improved interpretation of the results of in vitro sensitivity tests or by the design of certain genotypic approaches. The goal of the proposed approach is to provide the clinician with the necessary results for judicious decision-making in antibiotic therapy utilising available information and to draw his or her attention to the combinations of bacterium and antibiotic for which there is a therapeutic risk.",

The enzymes from Gram-positive cocci generally differ from the enzymes detected in Gram-negative bacteria. Generally, the presence of an enzyme confers to the host frank resistance to the antibiotics modified in vitro. However, there are some exceptions, both in Gram-negative and in Gram-positive bacteria. For instance, resistance of Gram-positive organisms to the kanamycin\u2013neomycin group of antibiotics is due to the synthesis of an APH(3\u2032)-III enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes efficient phosphorylation of amikacin in cell-free extracts but does not always determine resistance to this antibiotic. However, bactericidal synergism of amikacin with \u03b2-lactams or vancomycin is always abolished. Therefore, the test of kanamycin better predicts the activity of amikacin against Gram-positive organisms.

Staphylococci may be resistant to macrolides by production of a ribosomal methylase encoded by erm genes conferring the MLSB phenotype or by production of an efflux pump encoded by the msr(A) gene. In case of inducible MLSB resistance, clindamycin that is not an inducer remains active. However, constitutively resistant mutants can be selected by clindamycin and clinical failure during treatment by clindamycin have been reported in a few occasions. The use of clindamycin is probably best avoided in severe infections or infections with heavy bacterial inocula. In case of resistance by efflux, clindamycin is not substrate for the pump and the risk for selection of resistant mutants is not greater than that for erythromycin-susceptible isolates. By a disk diffusion test, the inducible MLSB phenotype can be identified by the flattening of the clindamycin zone facing the erythromycin disk.",

Most of patients with non-menstrual STSS have primary focal infections, mainly localised on skin or mucous membranes (22/34 cases, 65%). Mortality occurred rapidly after the onset of symptoms (median 3 days; range 1\u201317 days) in seven patients with non-menstrual STSS (7/32, 22%). Deceased patients were more aggressively treated in comparison to survivors but they never received clindamycin, linezolid or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg).",

Comparing with menstrual STSS, non-menstrual STSS patients have a high positive blood culture and mortality rate (50% and 22%, respectively). This could reflect an evolution of the S. aureus isolates towards a higher virulence and expression of various superantigenic toxins. Bacteraemia could partially explain the severity of non-menstrual cases and may be a composite form of shock, frontier between septic shock and STSS, potentially more severe than STSS itself. Specific therapeutic intervention has to be implemented for patients with non-menstrual STSS and we proposed the following strategy: rapid wound debridement whatever the importance of local inflammation; rapid addition of anti-toxinic antibiotic such as clindamycin or linezolid; and prescription of IVIg.",

The local irritation of the endothelium at the site of infusion leads to an inflammatory response with an increased expression of various cell surface antigens. Among these are CD 34, E-Selectin (CD 62E), ICAM-1 (CD 54) and VCAM-1 (CD 106). We studied the effects of three closely related antibiotics on human endothelial cells in vitro. We used the endothelial cell line EA.hy 926 and analysed the reaction by means of flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson). Cells were incubated with clarithromycin or azithromycin at concentrations ranging from 100 mg/l to 800 mg/l and at concentrations ranging from 200 mg/l to 1400 mg/l for erythromycin. Such concentrations occur under therapeutic conditions at the site of infusion. Subsequently, they were stained with fluoresceinisothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal IgG mouse-antibodies for the four antigens mentioned above. Cells were incubated with the drugs for 2 h and analysis was carried out after an additional time period of 22 h. In control cells, we found positively stained cells at the following levels: CD 34 (2%), E-Selectin (4%), ICAM-1 (14%) and VCAM-1 (2%). The most pronounced changes were observed at 800 mg/l (erythromycin), 600 mg/l (azithroymcin), and 400 mg/l (clarithromycin). Erythromycin (800 mg/l) caused significantly increased expressions of all epitopes [CD 34 (+6%), E-Selectin (+5%), ICAM-1 (+15%) and VCAM-1 (+5%)]. At 600 mg/l the azalide azithromycin provokes a stronger upregulation of the proinflammatory antigens: CD 34 (+17%), E-Selectin (+16%), ICAM-1 (+27%) and VCAM-1 (+17%). Clarithromycin at a concentration of 400 mg/l causes a similar effect as erythromycin at twice this concentration [CD 34 (+6%), E-Selectin (+7%), ICAM-1 (+23%) and VCAM-1 (+4%)]. Analysis of the cell surface markers involved in cell-cell-interactions proved to be a useful approach to further study the mechanism of infusion phlebitis and to compare the proinflammatory effects of related compounds in vitro.",

A great effort has to be dedicated by physicians and nurses to the achievement of a very high level of adherence, that represents a key factor to maintain a long-lasting protection of HIV-disease progression and a good quality of life.",

We have exploited the rapid and lethal action of these enzymes to destroy pathogenic and biological warfare bacteria on mucous membranes and in blood. These enzymes in general are specific for the species or strain from which they were produced, thus avoiding destruction of the surrounding normal commensal organisms found on mucosal surfaces. We now have enzymes that are specific for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter faecalis/E. faecium and group B streptococci. Our results show that in vitro 107 bacteria can be reduced to sterility seconds after enzyme contact. In animal model experiments, we were able to colonise mice with either streptococcal or pneumococcal species (orally or nasally) and remove these completely with phage enzymes delivered to these sites using a single enzyme dose. In a septicaemia model with S. pneumoniae, bacteria are reduced by >2-logs from the blood of infected animals with a single intravenous dose of enzyme. A lytic enzyme called PlyG from the gamma-phage of B. anthracis was specific for all worldwide isolates of B. anthracis. The enzyme specifically killed B. anthracis with no effect on other bacilli or other organisms. When >1 LD100 of B. anthracis bacilli were delivered i.v. to mice we observed a progression of symptoms, leading to survival of only 10% of animals followed for 12 days. When PlyG was injected i.v. 15 min after infection, a significant therapeutic effect was observed in which 90% of the mice recovered fully. Resistance to the enzymes has not been found nor do antibodies neutralise their activity. Furthermore, a combination of antibiotic and enzyme has been shown to work synergistically resulting in efficient lethal activity in cases of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Thus, phage lytic enzymes are a new reagent that may be used in hospitals, nursing homes and the general population to control antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria in blood and on mucosal surfaces, offering a capability previously unavailable.",

            "text": "Two-component signal transduction systems are ubiquitous in bacteria and are woven within the fabric of the regulatory processes that are used to sense environmental change and respond accordingly. These systems allow the bacterial cell to continually re-programme patterns of gene expression rapidly and in defined ways to bring about cellular adaptation as a direct consequence of specific environmental signals. To achieve this function two-component systems are composed of a signal ligand-responsive sensor histidine kinase that is usually an integral membrane protein, and a response regulator that is often a transcriptional regulator. Signal ligands are sensed by the sensor histidine kinase resulting in ATP-dependent autophosphorylation and the subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl moiety to the cognate response regulator influences its DNA binding and transcriptional activity, and therefore gene expression. For bacterial pathogens these signal transduction pathways are frequently key elements in the regulation of a myriad of virulence responses that facilitate colonisation, survival and persistence within the host environment and at specific host sites. Examples of the types of virulence attributes modulated by two-component systems include biofilm formation, quorum sensing, resistance to host defence peptides, and secreted toxin production. In addition, two-component systems that are essential for bacterial viability are known to exist. For these and other reasons two-component signalling systems and their variants have been recognized as targets for the development of anti-infective drugs. In this presentation the features of two-component systems that make them potentially attractive targets for the development of novel antiinfectives will be discussed. The mechanisms of action and limitations of some classes of previously developed two-component system inhibitors will also be discussed, as will the current and future perspectives for the development of selective inhibitors of these bacterial signalling systems.",

Unfortunately, we cannot assess the risk of acquiring MRSA from the clinical environment because there is no way of measuring the effect of cleaning. Perhaps it is time to introduce microbiological standards for surface levels in hospitals [3].

Healthcare workers who carry MRSA may transmit the micro-organism to patients. To control transmission and prevent the development of infection, eradication of carriage may be indicated. The decision to start decolonisation therapy should be carefully balanced with the risk for the development of resistance. Factors that are associated with increased failure rates are: the presence of wounds or other skin lesions, the presence of indwelling devices, multisite carriage and the presence of reservoirs at home. In individuals without these risk factors treatment with mupirocin nasal ointment is succesfull in the majority of subjects. It is often combined with the application of antiseptic showering. In individuals who fail on this topical treatment or with the presence of risk factors for failure, systemic antimicrobial treatment is indicated. Well-designed trials are not available so at present an evidence-based recommendation can not be made. The existing data indicate that a combination of two agents including rifampicin is preferred. The choice of the agents should be based on the susceptibility testing results. Treatment failure may be based on recolonisation from a persisting reservoir at home. Therefore, in patients who (repeatedly) fail on decolonisation therapy these sources should be sought for.",

The Yersinia invasin (Inv) is closely related to the intimins (EaeA) of enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). The Yersinia adhesin (YadA) is a trimeric autotransporter and member of the oligomer coiledcoil adhesin (Oca) family which comprises adhesins of Haemophilus influenzae (Hia), Moraxella catarrhalis (UspA) and other species. The yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster of the HPI is widely spread among members of the family of Enterobacteriaceae and has become a marker for extraintestinal pathogenicity, in particular in E. coli. The molecular analysis of the pathogenicity of Yersinia has not only improved our understanding of bacterial mechanism of invasion and persistence but has also provided us with new tools for laboratory diagnosis and prevention. Several PFs turned out to be useful antigens for (i) differentiation between virulent and avirulent Y. enterocolitica, (ii) detection of a class-specific serum antibody response (serological diagnosis) and (iii) vaccination. Moreover, the T3SS of yersiniae is suitable for delivery of antigens to antigen presenting cells and, thus, opens a new strategy for the design of oral live vaccine carrier strains.",

Currently, the most frequently identified pathotypes are the enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC) and diffusely adherent (DAEC) E. coli strains. Individual classes are defined on the basis of more or less characterised interactions between the bacterial cell and the host when inducing diarrhoea. There are several problems associated with the recognition of these strains in the laboratory. Easily detectable phenotypic markers sufficiently specific and sensitive to distinguish these strains from their non-pathogenic counterparts are not known. Although certain virulence factors (toxins, adhesins, invasins) are always, or often present in particular groups, the detection of their expression frequently goes beyond the capabilities of diagnostic laboratories. The use of molecular methods specific to genes of these factors, often in multiplexed PCR systems, is currently the most straightforward diagnostic approach. The detection of some of these genes (e.g. Shiga toxin, stx, or intimin, eae) can serve screening purposes but their identification may not prove the actual virulence of the isolate. Virulence factors can be shared by members of different pathotypes, and can be present in isolates recovered from healthy individuals or in non-pathogenic strains. For some classes it is still not clear which particular combination(s) of these genes are necessary to cause disease (e.g. EAEC), while in others the existence of subgroups with various pathogenic potential are already known to exist (e.g. EPEC, or Shiga toxin producing strains). Currently, the lack of straightforward diagnostic algorithms limits our knowledge on the epidemiology of diarrhoea-causing E. coli. Furthermore, more data on the incidence of these pathotypes should help to understand the role of the individual host's susceptibility in the outcome when encountering these strains.",

            "text": "Since their discovery antimicrobials have been extensively used in livestock and poultry, with significant beneficial effects on food animal health and production efficiency Most classes of antimicrobials used in animals, including fluoroquinolones, have human analogues. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are used in animal production primarily for: (1) therapy; (2) prophylaxis; (3) infection control (metaphylaxis); and (4) growth promotion in healthy animals. In contrast to human medicine in which treatment is customarily directed at the patient, entire groups of animals may be treated with the use of medicated feed and/or water. Moreover, growth-promoting dosages are usually at low concentrations for extended time periods, therefore both practices are a potentially significant driving force in accelerating the emergence of resistant bacteria in these animals that can be transferred through contact or food to infect humans. The acquisition of quinolone resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is mainly due to chromosomal mutations either in topoisomerase genes (mainly gyrA and parC) or in genes associated with a decreased uptake or by increased efflux of quinolones. In addition, a plasmid conferring low levels of quinolone resistance linked to the presence of the qnr gene, which encodes a protein protecting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from quinolones, has been reported. The above mentioned mechanisms have been described in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. and generate an increased level of FQ resistance in a step-wise model, with the first mutation found either in the gyrA gene or in genes involved in efflux pump(s), such these producing an over-expression of acrAB. However, Campylobacter spp. easily acquire high levels of FQ resistance associated with a mutation in the gyrA gene, likely because this microorganism does not have topoisomerase IV Several studies have demonstrated an association between FQ use in animals and the subsequent isolation of FQ-resistant bacteria from the same animal.

The symptoms caused by DENV range from self-limited, flu-like illness, to life-threatening haemorrhagic fever. DENV are immunologically grouped in four serotypes and secondary infection by a different serotype is presumably one of the factors favouring the haemorrhagic presentation. Routine diagnostics rely on the detection of DENV-specific IgM and IgG. However, because of the low antibody titres in the early phase of disease, serology is prone to false negative results. By allowing detection of the virus in this early phase, RT-PCR can close the diagnostic gap. The objective of this study was to improve the quality of DENV diagnostics at the Zentrum f\u00fcr Infektionsdiagnostik (ZID, Basel) by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, for early detection and molecular typing.",

MICs determination allowed to divide these isolates into two main phenotypical groups, both being resistant to most \u03b2-lactams including carbapenems. Twenty-two A. baumannii isolates possessed the blaOXA-97 gene encoding the novel carbapenem-hydrolysing oxacillinase OXA-97 differing from OXA-58 by a single amino acid substitution (Gly to Ala at position DBL35). OXA-97 exhibits the same hydrolysis profile as OXA-58, hydrolysing penicillins and carbapenems but sparing expanded-spectrum \u03b2-lactams. Genotyping revealed that the OXA-97-positive A. baumannii isolates belonged to a single clone, although six distinct genotypes were identified thus defining subclones. The blaOXA-97 gene was located on plasmids varying in size and they were all transferred to an A. baumannii reference strain by electroporation, whereas mating-out assays were unsuccessful. Only one isolate harboured the blaOXA-97 gene on its chromosome.",

ESBLs confer resistance to the oxyimino cephalosporins. In recent years the CTX-M \u03b2-lactamases, which preferentially hydrolyse cefotaxime, have been reported with increasing frequency worldwide. ESBL production in Shigella has previously been reported infrequently. Previous reports of ESBL production in Shigella spp. include a CTX-M-3 in Shigella sonnei in Turkey, CTX-M-2 in Shigella flexneri in Argentina, and CTX-M-14 in Shigella sonnei in Korea. This is the first report of CTX-M-15 in Shigella spp. Methods: Shigella species received between January 2003 and October 2006 were tested for susceptibility to a panel of 14 antimicrobial agents including the following \u03b2-lactam agents: ampicillin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefpodoxime, in accordance with CLSI disk diffusion methods. ESBL production was confirmed by the CLSI combination disk method for ESBL production using cefpodoxime. Confirmed ESBL producers were screened for blaCTX-M by PCR using specific primers. Strains encoding blaCTX-M-9, M-15, M-25, M-2 were used as positive controls. Amplicons were sequenced using primers homologous to those used for PCR.",

Co-resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and gentamicin was observed. No association with foreign travel was noted.

Conclusion: This is the first report of CTX-M-15 in Shigella spp. CTX-M-15 has been reported extensively in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli.
