Manikin studies (LOE 6)81, 82, 83 and one human study (LOE 7)84 showed that when there is no advanced airway (such as a tracheal tube, Combitube, or LMA) in place, a tidal volume of 1 L produced significantly more gastric inflation than a tidal volume of 500 mL. Studies of anaesthetised patients with no advanced airway in place showed that ventilation with 455 mL of room air was associated with an acceptable but significantly reduced oxygen saturation when compared with 719 mL (LOE 7).85 There was no difference in oxygen saturation with volumes of 624 and 719 mL (LOE 7).85 A study of cardiac arrest patients compared tidal volumes of 500 mL versus 1000 mL delivered to patients with advanced airways during mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen at a rate of 12 min\u22121 (LOE 2).86 Smaller tidal volumes were associated with higher arterial PCO2 and worse acidosis but no differences in PaO2.",

Arterial oxygenation and oxygen delivery to the brain were significantly higher with a ratio of 15:2 when compared with a ratio of either 50:5 or 50:2. In an animal model of cardiac arrest, a compression\u2013ventilation ratio of 30:2 was associated with significantly shorter time to ROSC and greater systemic and cerebral oxygenation than with continuous chest compressions (LOE 6).147 A theoretical analysis suggests that a compression\u2013ventilation ratio of 30:2 would provide the best blood flow and oxygen delivery (LOE 7).148\n",
