            "text": "Since December 2019, many unexplained pneumonia\u2019s had been reported, initially related to exposure at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China [1]. The pathogen was soon identified as a coronavirus, similar to those involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The novel coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ICTV), capable of infecting humans, on 11 February 2020 and the disease was termed COVID-19 by world health organization (WHO) [1]. Based on the current epidemiological surveys, the incubation period of this disease is 1\u201314 days, mostly 3\u20137 days. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the main manifestations. A few patients have symptoms such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea. Seriously ill patients may rapidly progress to ARDS. The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. As of March 18, 2020, a total of 186,777 confirmed cases with COVID-19 pneumonia have been reported globally, including 7480 deaths (4.0 %). A specific viral nucleic acid assay using real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was quickly developed to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 [2,3]. However, from the recently published literature, some patients with likely 2019-nCoV infection might have initial negative RT-PCR results [4]. Reasons for false negative RT-PCR tests may include insufficient cellular material for detection and improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials [5,6]. According to current experience, lung CT imaging may manifest abnormalities earlier than RT-PCR testing. Currently, high-resolution CT has been included as one of the main tools for screening, primary diagnosis, and evaluation of disease severity [7].",

Clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators: fever and / or respiratory symptoms, imaging characteristics of pneumonia, and / or normal or decreased white blood cells count or decreased lymphocyte count; and 3. Confirmed diagnosis: real-time RT-PCR detection of COVID-19 in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract; highly homologous with other novel coronavirus through virus gene sequencing [7,8]. The patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were all hospitalized and isolated for treatment. The discharge criteria were: 1. Afebrile for more than 3 days; 2. Respiratory symptoms significantly improved; 3. Obvious improvement of acute exudative lesions on chest CT; and 4. Two consecutive negative COVID-19 nucleic acid tests at least 24 h apart [7].",

On the scans, some other minor signs such as air bronchogram, cavitation, bronchiectasia, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pneumothorax and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (defined as a lymph node greater than 1 cm in short-axis diameter) were also noted. The distribution of pulmonary lesions was noted as peripheral (predominantly subpleural, involving mainly the peripheral one-third of the lung), central (predominantly lung hilum, involving mainly the central two-third of the lung), and diffuse (both subpleural and central regions).

Bilateral lungs were divided into five lung zones according to the anatomical structure of lung: left upper lobe, left lower lobe, right upper lobe, right middle lobe and right lower lobe. Each lung lobe was assigned a score which was based on the following criteria: score 0, 0% involvement; score 1, less than 5% involvement; score 2, 5% to less than 25 % involvement; score 3, 25 % to less than 50 % involvement; score 4, 50 % to less than 75 % involvement; and score 5, 75 % or greater involvement.

Other CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia included air bronchogram, bronchiectasis and pleural effusion with their maximum frequencies occurring in stage-2/4 (50.0 %), stage-6 (45.2 %) and stage-4 (27.9 %) respectively. Only a few patients had pericardial effusion (4.4 %) and pneumothorax (3.8 %). No mediastinal lymphadenopathy was observed on CT scanning (Table 2).",

Some patients also showed crazy-paving pattern (36.1 %), consolidation (25.5 %), or linear opacities (6.3 %) on early stage CT, which indicated either the rapid progress of the disease with poor prognosis or shorter course with good prognosis. Consistent with one study [10], some patients in our study (21.2 %) presented with negative chest CT at initial presentation (0\u20134 days symptoms). In the progressive stage (5\u20139 days), the CT features of the lesions were variable. Crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities increased significantly, indicating interstitial edema and alveolar exudation. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (10\u201314 days), stage-4 (15\u201321 days) and stage-5 (22\u201328 days), respectively, and decreased thereafter, reflecting variable patterns of pulmonary abnormality by stage and a long process of disease development. In addition, the changes of chest CT in patients with COVID-19 at different stages may reflect the pathological changes to some extent [8].",
