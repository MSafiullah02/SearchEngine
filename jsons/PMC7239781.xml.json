The patient was a local resident and had no obvious exposure to COVID-19. Initially, he received supportive care at a local geriatric hospital in December 2019. After receiving symptomatic treatment for one week to reduce his cough, the patient continued to suffer from shortness of breath. Two months later, in Feb 2020, the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 was performed for the patient at a community health center, and this test yielded a positive result. He was then admitted to a tertiary hospital in Wuhan. The patient had a significant past medical history, including a 30-year record of hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm, cerebral infarction, prostate hyperplasia, and complete loss of cognitive function for the preceding 3 years. Upon his hospital admission due to the COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient had stable vital signs, with a body temperature of 36.6 \u2103 (Fig. 1\nA), pulse of 87 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 beats/min, blood pressure of 125/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He had the following laboratory findings: red blood cell and lymphocyte counts were relatively low at 3.47 \u00d7 1012/L and 0.75 \u00d7 109/L, respectively, whereas white blood cell, neutrophil, and monocyte counts were within the normal range, at 4.5 \u00d7 109/L, 3.32 \u00d7 109/L, and 0.37 \u00d7 109/L, respectively. C-reactive protein was elevated at 108.43 mg/L. His fibrinogen level was 5.88 g/L, D-dimer was 2.63 mg/L, and other coagulation test results were normal. Liver functions were normal with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 34.2U/L and 23.8U/L, respectively. A chest radiograph obtained upon admission showed slight patchy and cord-like dense enhancements in both lungs and bronchovascular bundle thickening.",

Due to the patient\u2019s advanced age and increased risk for drug-induced toxicity, antiviral medications were not administered at that time. On day 5 of hospitalization, he had a relatively high SARS-CoV-2 viral load (2.55 \u00d7 104 copies/mL) by quantitative RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab (Fig. 1B). Because the patient was not suitable for antiviral treatment and there was no other effective therapy, the clinical team recommended that the patient receive convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma was collected via plasmapheresis from a donor who had recovered from COVID-19 for more than two weeks and had a SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD-specific IgG titer of >1:640. The patient received convalescent plasma twice from the same donor: 200 ml at 9:45 p.m. on the seventh day of hospitalization and 100 ml at 6:50 p.m. on the eleventh day of hospitalization. After convalescent plasma transfusions, the levels of white blood cells and neutrophils fluctuated but eventually stabilized within the normal range. The absolute lymphocyte counts had a downward trend from the time of admission (from 0.75 \u00d7 109/L to 0.63 \u00d7 109/L) but increased after the transfusions of convalescent plasma, reaching 1.08 \u00d7 109/L at the time of discharge (Fig. 1C). C-reactive protein showed a downward trend after convalescent plasma infusion (Fig. 1D). IL-6 increased to 66.21 pg/ml after the first infusion of convalescent plasma but subsequently declined (Fig. 1E). Patient\u2019s viral load decreased significantly, by a factor of approximately 18 (from 2.55 \u00d7 104 to 1.39 \u00d7 103 copies/mL), 24 hours after the first transfusion of convalescent plasma. Following the initial convalescent plasma transfusion, the patient also received antiviral treatment with the traditional Chinese medicine, but no significant decline in viral load was observed 24 hours after the treatment (from 1.39 \u00d7 103 to 1.20 \u00d7 103 copies/mL). As a result, a second transfusion of convalescent plasma was given to the patient, and then the viral load became undetectable (Fig. 1B). The patient had additional viral load testing on days 12 and 13 of hospitalization, with both days producing negative results, and he was discharged on day 13 of hospitalization. At the time of discharge, the patient had stable vital signs, with significant improvement in his cough and dyspnea. Given the age of the patient and his relatively minor lung changes at presentation, a chest radiograph was not repeated at discharge.",

Most elderly patients with COVID-19 develop advanced pneumonia and require ICU monitoring as a result of organ failure and declined immunity [3]. Moreover, senior patients have a high mortality rate. The patient in our report is an elderly man with multiple co-morbidities. Interestingly, he had a mild presentation with a persistent and prolonged course of COVID-19. He had respiratory symptoms but no obvious fever, although there was some temperature fluctuation (Fig. 1A), which may be attributable to his advanced age and decreased immunity. Fortunately, this 100-year-old man tolerated the transfusion of convalescent plasma in addition to the standard treatments and achieved good therapeutic outcomes.",
