First, after the military adenovirus vaccine program ended in 1999, Ad4 was found in an increasing majority of FRI cases [41] [42] [43] , and, recently, it was found to represent nearly all FRI cases [41, 44] . Genome typing of Ad4 isolates recovered from 8 different training sites revealed that 4 of the 7 known genomic variants of Ad4 individually dominate adenovirus populations for years at a time at particular training sites, virtually always to the exclusion of any other genome type [21] . The oc- currence of these genome types is not correlated between sites, obviating a shared external source (e.g., incoming recruits). Second, in Army training centers, all recruits depart for a 2-week period at the end of December. On the recruits' return, FRI cases are seen, but adenovirus is not considered to be an etiology for the first couple of weeks. Studies have shown that local staff do not harbor the virus; however, inevitably, year after year, FRI rates due to the same endemic adenovirus strain resume expected levels [41] . Generally, the rate slowly begins to increase after 1 month, and it does not return to expected levels until \u03f32 months after the beginning of January. Russell et al. [3] similarly found, at another training center, that none of the 271 recruits studied who were tested within 1 day of arriving at the center had oropharyngeal evidence of viable Ad4, and only 1 had evidence of Ad4 DNA. Thus, they are not coming to the center with the prevailing Ad4 virus and especially not with the Ad4 genome type specific to the training center. It is likely that the pathogen reservoir is the environment.",

[3] had Ad4 DNA detected in swab specimens collected from their hands by the second day of training. Apparently, recruits are exposed to FRI-inducing pathogens almost immediately on arrival at the training center. It is possible that these structures are contaminated by infectious individuals and are not themselves infectious. However, because these are the structures where the subjects live and receive medical care, and because it is known that adenovirus is transmissible via surface-to-hand contact [29] , these findings suggest that environmental sources of infection are critical to the propagation and maintenance of high FRI prevalence rates in this setting. This early exposure could have played a role in the negligible subsequent effects of cohorting.",

Survival on surfaces may explain the persistence of Ad4 and its type-specific niche at a training center, but, because it is also clear that Ad4 can be transmitted by person-to-person contact, we must account for personal interactions. It is quite likely that recruits who are not already infected by Ad4 pick it up within their own units or while visiting the medical clinic (from its surfaces or other infectious recruits) and then bring it back to the unit. Person-to-person transmission is then facilitated by crowding, as the statistically significant association between population size and FRI rates indicate ( figure 1) . A similar effect of crowing should be expected for any civilian setting involving close quarters.",

[13] presented evidence that respiratory illness in the Navy in World War II was related to the number of people per room and not to population density. On the other hand, at a naval recruit training center, Miller [19] found that newer, larger barracks with more space per recruit were associated with lower FRI rates, even though the number of recruits per room was equivalent in the old and new barracks. He suggested that some of these apparent contradictions may be due to the nature of the pathogen responsible and the time at which an outbreak occurs during training. For example, data produced by Breese et al. [13] show that, in the first 2 weeks of training, correlations between illness and density were relatively higher than those between illness and population size; however, the reverse was the case for the second 4 weeks. Thus, although it is natural to assume that there is some association between the number of people in a space and the rates of illness, it is advisable to keep in mind that population size and density may interact in different ways with the type of pathogen and the amount of time that a unit of people have been together (for comparison, see the article by Bernstein [11] ).",

Larger populations increase the likelihood of personto-person spread, but they also increase the likelihood of maintaining and increasing the environmental reservoir, which may be very robust. Teasing out the relative influence of these factors would require a prospective study that we did not perform here, with even greater control than that found by Russell et al. [3] In summary, we found no statistically significant effect of a social distancing procedure in which some units were closed to an influx of potentially infectious individuals. The hypothesis of the present study assumed that the primary mode of transmission was from person to person. However, on the basis of our negative results and the evidence of fomite habitation of the virus presented in the current article and in other studies [3, 21, 41] , environmental contamination of pathogens is implicated as playing a larger role in the spread of respiratory disease in this setting than was previously assumed. An environmental reservoir likely initiates transmission cycles.",
