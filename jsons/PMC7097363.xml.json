Fortunately, the bill died in the state senate. Although this anecdote might appear a historical curiosity to scientists today, nonexperts are becoming more and more prominent in formulating public policy decisions that require an understanding of subtle and complex scientific and technological phenomena.",

To gauge public opinion in advance of a decision scheduled for late in the year on whether to allow commercial planting of GM crops, at great expense the UK government sponsored a series of public discussions (ironically termed 'GM Nation') around the country, as well as using more conventional methods, such as focus groups.
