            "text": "TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), also known as NF-\u03baB-activating kinase (NAK) or T2K, is one of two non-canonical I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) implicated in regulating the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. TBK1 was originally identified as a kinase that mediated TANK\u2019s ability to activate NF-\u03baB [1]. TBK1 is an 84 kDa, 729-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal kinase domain, an ubiquitin like domain and two C-terminal coiled-coil domains [1]. As a non-canonical IKK, TBK1 is structurally similar to IKK\u03b5 (another IKK-related kinase) and the canonical IKKs, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 [1], [2], [3], [4]. The canonical IKKs and the IKK-related kinases could regulate each other by an intricate network involving phosphorylation of their catalytic and regulatory subunits to balance their activities during innate immunity [5]. Once activated, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 phosphorylate IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, decreasing the activity of the canonical IKK complex [5]. On the other hand, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 phosphorylate and directly activate TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 [5].",

            "text": "TBK1 could induce I\u03baB degradation and NF-\u03baB activity through IKK\u03b2 [1], [2]. However, studies with TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 single-null and double-null mice did not observe a deficiency in NF-\u03baB activation [6], [7]. Therefore, the function of TBK1 in NF-\u03baB activation remains controversial and needs to be further investigated. Although the role of TBK1 in the NF-\u03baB pathway is controversial, its role in IRF3 activation and antiviral immunity is convincing. TBK1 coordinates with IKK\u03b5 to phosphorylate transcript factors IRF3 and IRF7, leading to the induction of type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Although TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 have indistinguishable activities in inducing type I IFN expression and subsequential antiviral responses, they do not seem to be redundant and exhibit differential expression patterns and substrates specificity [8], [11]. TBK1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas IKK\u03b5 expression is restricted to particular tissue compartments and expressed at low basal levels in immune cells [2], [11], [87].",

            "text": "The production of type I IFN is a fundamental cellular response to combating viral invasion [12], [13]. Various virus structural components, including viral DNA, double stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and surface glycoproteins, are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed in multiple immune cells. Among these PRR members, TLR3 [14], retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I; also known as DDX58) [15], [16], [17], melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; also known as IFIH1) [18], nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2) [19], RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) [20], [21], DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI; also known as ZBP1) [22], IFN\u03b3-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) [23], [24], DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) [25] and several DExD/H-box helicase superfamily members (DDX41 [26], DDX1\u2013DDX21\u2013DHX36 complex [27],) utilize TBK1 to activates downstream signaling transduction. These PRRs recruit different adaptors including TLR/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF), mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also called IPS-1, Cardif, or VISA) and stimulator of IFN genes (STING; also known as MITA, MPYS and ERIS) to activate TBK1 (Fig. 1\n). Activated TBK1 then phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7, triggers their dimerization and nuclear translocation, where they form active transcriptional complexes that bind to IFN stimulation response elements (ISRE) and activate type I IFN genes expression [28]. Secreted type I IFN binds to IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) and triggers the production of numerous anti-viral genes through the JAK/STAT pathway [29].",

            "text": "Besides its function in TBK1\u2013IRF3 signaling pathways, TBK1 participates in the regulating of autophagy [30], [31], [32]. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process of the eukaryotic cell and involved in diverse cellular and physiological functions including cell-autonomous defense against pathogens [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Autophagy and its machinery can be utilized as one of the earliest eukaryotic defense mechanisms against viral pathogens [36]. In the context of bacterial invasion, TBK1 was found to be a crucial regulator of immunological autophagy. In response to bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR4 activates TBK1 and NDP52 (an autophagic adaptor) recruits TBK1 into a complex with optineurin (OPTN, a key component of pathogen-induced autophagy), leading to the phosphorylation of OPTN and promoting the elimination of bacterial by OPTN-mediated xenophagy [32], [38], [39]. Furthermore, TBK1 also controls autophagic maturation [31]. Although both TBK1 and autophagy play crucial role in antiviral immunity, the roles of TBK1 in linking innate antiviral immunity with autophagy remains to be determined.",

Recruiting of multiple TBK1 dimers to signaling complexes enables activation-loop swapping of locally clustered TBK1 and results in Ser172 phosphorylation [40], [41]. Additional transautoactivation events occur due to high local concentration [40]. Furthermore, GSK3\u03b2 binds with TBK1, facilitates TBK1 auto-phosphorylation at Ser172 within its kinase activation loop and promotes TBK1 activation upon viral infection [42]. Several phosphatases have been identified as regulators of phosphorylation of TBK1 to attenuated IFN-\u03b2 production. For example, the inositol 5\u2032 phosphatase SHIP-1, previously known as an important negative regulator of TLR4 signaling [43], [44], targets TBK1 to inhibit TLR3-induced IFN-\u03b2 production [45]. The absence of SHIP-1 resulted in constitutive association between TRAF3, TRIF, and TBK1, altered localization of the protein following TLR3 stimulation, and increased levels of phosphorylated TBK1 [45]. Protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1B (PPM1B; also called PP2C\u03b2) physiologically binds to TBK1 followed virus infection and dephosphorylates TBK1 at serine 172, leading to termination of TBK1-mediated IRF3 activation [46]. Furthermore, it has been reported that glucocorticoid hormones could inhibit TBK1 phosphorylation on Ser-172 [47].",

E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 mediates lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 and facilitates its activation [48]. E3 ubiquitin ligases mind bomb 1 and 2 (MIB1 and MIB2) [33] and Nrdp1 [49] activate TBK1 by promoting its K63-linked polyubiquitination. On the other hand, several deubiquitinases disrupt K63-linked polyubiquitination to terminate TBK1-mediated signaling transduction. For example, deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) removes K63-linked polyubiquitin from TBK1 [50], [51]. Harhaj and co-workers [52], [53] identified A20 regulatory complex including ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 (also known as TNFAIP3), Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1, also known as T6BP or TXBP151) and A20 binding inhibitor of NF-\u03baB 1 (ABIN1) antagonizes K63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1. In this model, ABIN1 is recruited to ubiquitinated forms of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 via its UBD and also recruits TAX1BP1 and A20 to form an A20 regulatory complex. The A20 complex disrupts interactions between TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and TRAF3 to attenuate antiviral signaling. Recently, Charoenthongtrakul et al. reported that RING Finger Protein 11 (RNF11) cooperated with TAX1BP1 and attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 to block IFN-\u03b2 production [54].",

NLR protein NLRP4 recruits the E3 ligase DTX4 to TBK1 for K48-linked polyubiquitination, which led to degradation of TBK1 [55]. Recently, we report that TRAF-interacting protein (TRIP), a virus-induced E3-ligase, negatively regulates antiviral response by promoting proteasomal degradation of TBK1 [56]. However, whether any deubiquitinating enzymes exist to specifically remove K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and stabilizes its expression needs to be further investigated.

Thus, preventing the formation of functional TBK1-containing complexes is a major mechanism for negative regulation. For example, MIP-T3, which specifically interacts with TRAF3 but not other TRAF proteins, could impede the formation of functional TRAF3\u2013TBK1 complexes to terminate IFN-\u03b2 activation [62]. SIKE (Suppressor of IKK\u03b5) functions as a physiological suppressor of IKK\u03b5/TBK1 by sequesterin g IKK\u03b5/TBK1 in inactive complexes [63]. SIKE associated with TBK1 under physiological conditions and dissociated with TBK1 upon TLR3 engagement or viral infection. SIKE disrupts the interactions of IKK\u03b5 or TBK1 with TRIF and IRF-3 and blocks the interaction of IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 with RIG-I [63]. IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56, also known as IFIT1) suppresses cellular antiviral responses through specific disruption of the MAVS\u2013STING\u2013TBK1 complex by steric hindrance [64].",

However, the effects of OPTN on TBK1 regulation are controversial. Mankouri et al. reported that OPTN was a negative regulator in the induction of IFN-\u03b2 in response to RNA virus infection [66]. OPTN targets TBK1 to specific sites in the cell [66], and that this may prevent the TBK1-containing complexes formation. On the contrary, Gleason et al. demonstrated OPTN as an enhancer of TBK1 activity [67]. OPTN binds to polyubiquitylated species formed in response to LPS and poly(I:C), enhancing the activation of TBK1 that is required for optimal phosphorylation of IRF3 and production of IFN-\u03b2 [67]. The discrepancy of OPTN in the regulation of TBK1 activity might be due to the fact that different cells used in these studies. Thus, the potential role and exact mechanism of OPTN in TBK1 activation require further investigation.",

            "text": "The leader proteinase (Lpro) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a papain-like proteinase and plays an important role in FMDV pathogenesis. Lbpro, a shorter form of Lpro, has deubiquitinating activity and inhibited ubiquitination of TBK1 [69]. Papain-like protease domain 2 (PLP2), a catalytic domain of the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) of mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) which is conserved for the Class II coronaviruses also mediates deubiquitination of TBK1 and inactivates its kinase activity to phosphorylate IRF3 [70]. In addition, PLP2 also delays the dissociation of IRF3 from TBK1, thereby effectively attenuates IFN induction [71]. The \u03b3134.5 protein of herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protein could interact directly with TBK1, and that this binding disrupts the interaction of TBK1 and IRF3 [72], [73], [74]. NAP1 (NAK-associated protein 1), TANK and SINTBAD (similar to NAP1 TBK1 adaptor) are three adaptor proteins that specifically bind TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and participate in TLR/RLR-induced IFN production [75], [76], [77]. Modulation of these adaptor proteins could regulate IFN production [78]. Vaccinia virus (VACV) protein C6 is expressed early during infection and interacts with NAP1, TANK and SINTBAD [79]. Although C6 interact with all three scaffold proteins and inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production, it does not affect their interaction with TBK1. Thus, the exact mechanism whereby C6 disrupts IRF3 activation remains not well determined [79]. K7, another VACV protein, also targets TBK1-containing protein complex [80]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus M protein and NY-1 hantavirus (NY1V) Gn cytoplasmic tail could suppress TRAF3\u2013TBK1 complex formation [81], [82], [83]. The Tula virus (TULV), another hantavirus, regulates TBK1 activity through its Gn cytoplasmic tail [84]. However, the TULV Gn protein, unlike its pathogenic NY1V Gn cytoplasmic tail counterpart, is unable to bind TRAF3 [83], [84]. The mechanism by which TULV and NY-1V Gn proteins regulate TBK1 complex remains to be further investigated. Borna disease virus (BDV) P protein physically associates with TBK1 and inhibits its kinase activity [85]. Open reading frame 45 (ORF45) of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) suppresses activation of IRF7 by competing with the associated IRF7 and inhibits its phosphorylation by TBK1 [86], [87]. Poxvirus protein N1L [88] and HCV protease NS2 [89] could interact directly with TBK1 and reduce IRF3 activation and subsequent IFN-\u03b2 expression. However, whether NIL and NS2 exert their inhibitory effects through steric hindrance of TBK-containing complex formation or suppression of TBK1 kinase activity remains unclear.",

            "text": "Several small molecule inhibitors specific for TBK1 have been discovered. These compounds can be used simply and rapidly and provide a complementary approach to the use of mouse knockouts or RNA interference technology. BX795 [originally developed as a 3-phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)] [90] and a series of azabenzimidazole derivatives [91] inhibit both IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 at low nanomolar concentrations [92]. But, these compounds lack selectivity as other kinases were also inhibited at low concentrations. Using a positional scanning peptide library (PSPL) technology, Hutti et al. [93] identified 227 compounds inhibit TBK1 activity at a concentration of 10 mM. However, none of these compounds were suitable inhibitors of TBK1 due to lacking specificity. Recently, McIver et al. developed a novel series of 2,4-diamino-5-cyclopropylpyrimidines as potent inhibitors of TBK1, with improved kinase selectivity. However, these compounds encountered unexpected toxicity at higher doses [94]. As TBK1 is a kinase of convergence for multiple pivotal signaling pathways, the further refinement of novel and specific TBK1 inhibitors may provide powerful new therapeutic drugs for many diseases, such as inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancers. For example, the anticancer drug SU6668 (an indolinone compound), which was originally designed as a selective inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumor vascularization [95], was further identified as a TBK1 inhibitor and modulated the proangiogenic role of the TBK1/IRF3 signaling axis in cancer development [96], [97].",

Besides its antiviral activity, TBK1 was also found to be involved in other signaling pathways, such as autophagy, apoptosis and oncogenesis. TBK1 controls autophagic maturation and plays crucial roles in antibacterial responses [31], [32], [98], [99]. TBK1 was also involved in cellular transformation and oncogenesis [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105]. Recently, Jin et al. reports that TBK1 controls IgA class switching by negatively regulating non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling [106]. Furthermore, the emerging role of TBK1 in a couple of diseases, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, was also elucidated [97], [107], [108]. Therefore, TBK1 will be potential promising targets for the development of therapeutic drugs for these diseases [97], [109].",
