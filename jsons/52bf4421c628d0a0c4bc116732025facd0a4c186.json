SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus cluster, same as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (2). Type-I interferon (IFN-I) activates intracellular pathogen defense and influence the development of innate immunity and adaptive immunity. The DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream effector STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also known as ERIS/ MITA) control transcription of many inflammatory mediators, including type I and type III interferons (3, 4). However, abnormal recognition or interpretation of danger-Suramin interacts with the positively charged region surrounding the 5-fold axis of the EV-A71 capsid and inhibits multiple enterovirus A.",

And STING gain-of-function mutants is responsible for various devastating autoimmune diseases known as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) (6) (7) (8) . Excessive inflammation induced by STING disorder damages the body's own cells and tissues, causing SAVI phenotype including systemic inflammation, destructive skin lesions, and interstitial lung disease (6) . In SARS infected mice model, rapid spreading virus ultimately induced a delayed IFN-I production and promoted severe disease in the late state by boosting accumulation of pathogenic monocyte-macrophages, resulting in lung immunopathology, vascular leakage, and suboptimal T cell responses(9). In SARS patients, high IFN and IFNstimulated chemokine levels, plus robust antiviral IFN-stimulated gene expression, accompanied early SARS sequelae and poor clinical course (10). In Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection, and silica-induced lung inflammation, STING dependent disordered IFN-I response was also reported (11, 12) . In COVID-19, the lung damage level and the level of cytokines in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients were higher than those in healthy adults (2) . Similar phenomena were also found in SARS patients and silica-induced lung inflammation patients. Given that preventing cGAS-STING pathway from aberrant activation may be a suitable strategy for treatment of severe lung diseases induced by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens, we suppose that several proteins in the pathway are potential targets for COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). STING is a popular drug target as immunosuppressants in recent years (14, 15) . Several STING regulatory molecules were developed by academy and industry (16) . Unfortunately, none STING directly-target molecules has been marketed yet.",

Sorafenib is shown to be a potent STING inhibitor Using drugs targeting STING regulatory proteins to regulate IFN-I production is also a potential strategy to meet an urgent need for marketed drugs. Recently, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors were reported to be a specific and effective STING antagonists both in vitro and in vivo (17) . ALK directly interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to trigger serinethreonine protein kinase AKT phosphorylation and activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor \uf06bB (NF-\uf06bB) signaling pathways, enabling STING-dependent rigorous inflammatory responses (12) . Thus, ALK-targeted drugs have great potential in treating moderate to severe lung inflammation in COVID- 19. cGAS, which is the cytosolic DNA sensor upstream STING, is also a potential therapeutic target for IFN-I regulating. Suramin, an approved antiparasitic drug, was reported to be an effective cGAS antagonist by displacing the bound DNA from cGAS (18) . Suramin was reported as an entry inhibitor for various of viruses including DNA virus and RNA virus (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Clinical trial application of Suramin had been submitted in China on 21th Feb(24).",

Cells then were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM \u03b2-glycerolphosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM DTT) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were incubated with anti-Flag beads or with Protein A/G Sepharose (Amersham) plus anti-IRF3, anti-p-IRF3, antiviperin and anti-GFP antibodies for at least 4 h. The beads were washed with cold PBS for three times and eluted with DTT-containing SDS sample buffer by boiling for 10 min before Western blot analysis.",
