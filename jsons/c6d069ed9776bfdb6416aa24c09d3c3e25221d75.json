This urgent situation is pressing the world to respond with the development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. Along these efforts, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) has been rapidly resolved and made publicly available to facilitate global efforts to develop novel drug candidates. Recently, our group has developed a novel deep learning platform -Deep Docking (DD) which provides fast prediction of docking scores of Glide (or any other docking program) and, hence, enables structure-based virtual screening of billions of purchasable molecules in a short time. In the current study we applied DD to all 1.3 billion compounds from ZINC15 library to identify top 1,000 potential ligands for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein. The compounds are made publicly available for further characterization and development by scientific community.",

            "text": "Previous research efforts to develop anti-viral agents against members of Coronaviridae family demonstrated that the Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) entry receptor, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the main protease (Mpro) proteins may represent suitable drug targets. [7] Although initially promising, inhibitors targeting ACE2 (hence aiming to block critical coronavirushost interactions) did not advance clinically due to significant side effects. [8] Likewise, RdRp inhibitors appeared to be not very specific and demonstrated overall lower potency, that also translated into common side effects in patients. [1, 9] Nevertheless, rapid drug repurposing efforts have identified Remdesivir, a RdRp inhibitor, as a promising antiviral drug against COVID-19. [10, 11] Clinical trials are currently ongoing to determine the full efficacy spectrum of the compound in patients (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04280705 [12] ). Concurrently, CoV infected patients administered with protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown improved outcome, [1, 13] demonstrating the potential of the main protease (Mpro) as the most promising drug target in CoVs [14, 15] Hence, a recently published X-ray crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro provides an excellent ground for structure-based drug discovery efforts. [16] Earlier efforts to target SARS-CoV resulted in identification of several covalent Mpro inhibitors targeting the catalytic dyad of the protein defined by His41 and Cys145 [17] residues. However, covalent inhibitors are often marked by adverse drug responses, off-target side effects, toxicity and lower potency. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Therefore, noncovalent protease inhibitors may have advantages for the treatment of this kind of infections. Still, the majority of approved drugs administered as anti-SARS were designed for other viral strains (Table S1 in supplementary material) . Notably, no CoVprotease specific inhibitor has yet successfully completed a clinical development program to date. [19, 23] The impact of current COVID-19 outbreak and the likelihood of future CoV epidemics strongly advocate for rapid development of new treatments and fast intervention protocols. Few research groups have already suggested potential repurposing strategies for clinically approved drugs [24] [25] [26] or proposed de novo agents [27] as therapeutic solutions for SARS-CoV-2. However, previously reported docking (virtual screening) campaigns with Mpro targets were able to process only few millions or even thousands compounds. [6, [28] [29] [30] The main reason for that is that conventional docking is too computationally expensive and slow, while the libraries of available chemicals are growing exponentially. [31] To address this general challenge, we have recently developed a novel deep learning-based approach for accelerated screening of large chemical libraries, consisting of billions of entities. This Deep Docking (DD) platform utilizes quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models trained on docking scores of database subsets to approximate in an iterative manner the docking outcome of the remaining entries. Importantly, DD does not provide any novel scoring function for docking, thus its accuracy relies completely on the docking program that is used. The development of deep learning scoring functions has been already attempted, but results have shown various degrees of success which could be due to a lack of appropriate datasets. [32, 33] Likely, as the very nature of docking is approximate, the improvements are likely to come from better approximation of physical-chemical processes, including solvation, enthalpic and entropic factors, rather than from a better training base and procedures. [34, 35] Thus, our method represents not just feasible, but also practical options for utilizing deep learning in virtual screening. Herein we have used DD for large-scale virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site.",

[37] Our benchmarking study revealed good ability of Glide SP to dock known inhibitors. First, the co-crystallized ligand (SID 24808289 from Turlington et al. [38] ) was accurately redocked to its binding site (root mean square deviation (r. m.s.d.) of 0.86 \u00c5 between Glide and x-ray pose, Figure 1a) . Second, ROC AUC value for Glide SP used to dock 81 Mpro inhibitors and~4,000 decoys was 0.72, similarly to the more computationally expensive Glide XP protocol (Figure 1b) , and 0.74 when active molecules were diluted in 1 million random compounds extracted from ZINC15 (Figure S1 in supplementary material) . Thus, in light of recent studies advocating for extending virtual screening to large chemical libraries when docking works well at smaller scales, [31] we decided to use Glide SP as DD docking program to screen ZINC15 against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. DD relies on a deep neural network trained with docking scores of small random samples of molecules extracted from a large database to predict the scores of remaining molecules and, therefore, discard low scoring molecules without investing time and resources to dock them. The combination of an iterative process to improve model training and the use of simple 2D QSAR descriptors such as Morgan fingerprints makes DD particularly suited for fast virtual screening of emerging giga-sized chemical libraries using standard computational resources. We have recently showed the wide range of applicability of DD by using the method to dock all ZINC15 compounds to 12 targets representing major protein families of therapeutic interest. [52] The use of DD platform enabled us to dock 1.3 billion compounds from ZINC15 database [44] into SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site using standard Glide SP protocols in a week. In our benchmark study on SARS Mpro, AUC ROC for Glide SP improved from 0.72 to 0.78, when a ligand efficiency (LE) cutoff of \u00c0 0.20 kcal/mol was introduced prior to ranking molecules by their docking scores ( Figure S2 in supplementary material). Thus, the top 1,000 hits selected from the DD run were picked following the same strategy.",

[53] The positions of the residues on the polyproteins are named depending on their relative position to the cleavage site. Position P1 corresponds to the residue just before the cleavage site, followed by P2, P3, P4, P5, and up until the Nterminal of the cleavage site. Position P1' corresponds to the residue immediately following the cleavage site, followed by P2', P3', P4', P5' and up until the C-terminal of the cleavage site. [54] The protease recognizes specific residues at each position of the polyproteins to determine a cleavage site and initiate the replication-transcription complex necessary for viral replication. [55] Based on the consensus recognition sequence of the polyproteins, a substrate-analogue inhibitor, CMK, was designed to mimic positions P1 to P6 of the substrate in the SARS Mpro substrate-binding sites. The compound is characterised by its chloromethyl ketone warhead and its core sequence of Val(P6)-Asn(P5)-Ser(P4)-Thr(P3)-Leu(P2)-Gln(P1) to occupy the same volume as the residues of the recognition sequence. [56] An X-ray crystallography structure of the SARS Mpro with the CMK inhibitor revealed the mode of inhibitor binding to the substrate-binding sites of the main protease, providing a crucial structural basis for rational drug design and guiding drug discovery efforts against the SARS Mpro (PDB 1UK4 [57] ). Therefore, the pocket of the Mpro can be partitioned into different sections, depending on the volume occupied by polyprotein residues at each positions.",

The Glide SP scores of the top 1,000 candidates we selected were significantly better than top 1,000 molecules from a 1 million random sample of ZINC15 entries, and even better than top candidates from BindingDB protease inhibitor library, which were docked to the same site ( Figure 4) .",

Encouragingly, we observed just two common frameworks, clearly indicating that screening 1.36 billion enables identification of new chemical classes that can potentially inhibit SARS-COV-2 Mpro. Thus, DD allowed us to rapidly narrow down ZINC15 to a smaller dataset enriched with high scoring compounds, which consists of novel molecules with highly favourable docking scores as well as significantly different structures than known protease inhibitors.",
