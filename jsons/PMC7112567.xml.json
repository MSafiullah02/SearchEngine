Informed by clinical presentation, epidemiological data, guidelines and local resources, a laboratory will perform targeted tests for a disease. These are largely confined to specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serological assays. This approach has fundamental limitations, and contributes to the relatively high proportion of encephalitis cases that remain undiagnosed. Aside from the difficulties of testing for the myriad of rare pathogens that might be expected to cause encephalitis, this approach does not permit the identification of new or unexpected pathogens. Undeniably, methods for novel pathogen discovery such as electron microscopy and cell culture have existed for many years, however they are cumbersome, time-consuming, lack sensitivity and specificity and are often no longer routinely available. Furthermore, there are groups of patients, such as immunosuppressed patients, who frequently present with subtle or non-specific symptoms and signs, are high-risk for encephalitis, infection with unexpected or unusual pathogens, and are seen to have more severe outcomes.21\n",

Phan et al.37 confirmed, via repeat DNA extraction using an alternative method, that the source of the cyclovirus is not reagent contamination. Nevertheless, whilst screening CSF samples for cyclovirus by PCR, Tan et al.29 detected cyclovirus in the CSF of patients in whom the aetiology of their central nervous system (CNS) disease had already been confirmed as Japanese encephalitis, dengue virus or bacterial meningitis. The only identified cellular host for gemycircularviruses is fungi. In the absence of other evidence of pathogenicity, such as seroconversion or demonstration of the pathogen within cells in the brain, the probability remains that detection of cyclovirus or gemycircularvirus in CSF is an incidental finding. Similarly the detection of densovirus, a small linear ssDNA virus, in CSF may be incidental since it was detected in a case with confirmed N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor encephalitis.44 Autoimmune antibodies have previously been co-detected with herpesvirus DNA in CSF from cases of encephalitis,53 however the host range of densoviruses is to date exclusively invertebrates; the authors suggest a possible explanation for detection in CSF is the passive transfer of virus from an insect bite or CSF contamination from skin flora or an environmental source.

The aforementioned studies also included only samples for which primary routine diagnostic testing using standard methods was negative therefore the utility of NGS as a first-line test cannot be assessed. A higher diagnostic yield was reported where specimens were tested using metagenomics as a first-line screening tool; 19% using whole CSF41 and 30% using brain biopsies.45 The use of brain tissue rather than CSF may increase diagnostic yield.

Conversely if the negative control fails (i.e. an unexpected organism is identified in the sequence data) this could indicate reagent contamination or a problem with the analysis pipeline and thus positive results from samples processed in parallel are invalidated and should be repeated. This having been said, of 44 cases of encephalitis identified in this review (Table 1), only 5 included positive controls and 15 included negative controls. The accuracy of a positive result is critical for patient management; however a negative result can also be useful to exclude infection, particularly where anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive treatments are being considered.

This is also a recognised problem with pan-bacterial PCR detection which is used clinically,55 however can be confounded in metagenomics by differences between specimens and specimen types (for instance tissue biopsies versus CSF) in the quantity of genomic material, the ratio of host:pathogen sequences and, depending on the sequencing chemistry and degree of specimen multiplexing, the sequencing yield. Some of these limitations may be overcome by the careful use of processing and sequencing controls, as discussed elsewhere.23\n",

The consequence of this is wasted cost, as the sequencing reaction is dominated by host rather than pathogen sequences, and also has implications for the turn-around times and sensitivity of pathogen detection. In order to detect pathogen sequences, which can be as few as nine in 68 million reads,30 vast sequencing read depths are required; very high throughput sequencing platforms with only a very limited number of samples sequenced in parallel are required to achieve this. To overcome this, depletion of host DNA or RNA prior to sequencing is required; however the options for this are currently limited and are not all suitable for detection of viral pathogens. Improved methods for host DNA and RNA depletion would considerably reduce the cost and time to result and improve the sensitivity of metagenomics for diagnosis of encephalitis.",

            "text": "Notably, current turn-around-times prevent the replacement of routine methods, such as PCR, for the diagnosis of acute encephalitis. For these reasons, the role of NGS in clinical algorithms is still to be delineated. At this point in time, we suggest NGS is routinely applied for the diagnosis of acute cases of encephalitis for which no cause is found after targeted investigations using PCR. Recommendations for first-line targeted testing are discussed in detail elsewhere14 but in the UK should include PCR for HSV, VZV and enteroviruses. However due to differing local epidemiology clinicians should consult the relevant national guidelines.8, 13, 14, 16, 17 In immunocompromised patients however, metagenomics ought to be considered earlier; 73% of case reports in this review involved immunocompromised patients. This is the population at most risk of infection with novel and unexpected organisms and, moreover, may present with a more chronic or insidious clinical history58 in which a one-week turn-around-time is more acceptable. Given that the causative pathogen is not always detected in CSF, in all cases of encephalitis in which diagnosis by NGS is being sought the preferred specimen type is brain biopsy. Nevertheless CSF samples are acceptable if it is the only specimen available. Our recommendations for the use of NGS in diagnosis of microbial causes of encephalitis are summarised in Fig. 5a\n, with the contrasting algorithm for targeted testing summarised in Fig. 5b. This review was limited to pathogen detection by NGS in brain biopsies or CSF. There may also be a role for testing other specimens, such as throat samples and urine. This was recently shown in an encephalitis case diagnosed by NGS of urine, identifying a case of Japanese encephalitis virus.59\n",
