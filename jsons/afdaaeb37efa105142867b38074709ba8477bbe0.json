The U.S. CDC has just adjusted R 0 to 5.7, 54 meaning that each patient has spread infection to another 5.7 individuals on average. While the R 0 of 55 SARS-CoV was estimated to be 2-5 (17) , it seems that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is stronger 56 than that of SARS-CoV. SARS was the first new infectious disease identified in the twenty-first 57 century. This acute, and often severe, respiratory illness originated in the Guangdong province of 58 China in November 2002 (18) . By the end of June 2003, there were 8,450 cases and 810 deaths caused 59 by SARS (www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mguide_sars.html). The overall fatality of SARS is about 10% in the 60 general population, but approximately 50% in patients aged 65 years old and older (19) . Although the 61 mortality rate of COVID-19 is not as high as that of SARS in 2002-2003, the number of confirmed 62 cases has markedly surpassed that of SARS. In addition, the incubation period of COVID-19 ranged 63 from 1 to 14 days, with an average of 10 days, and the patients in the incubation period or 64 presymptomatic infected-individuals could potentially transmit the virus to uninfected people, which 65 makes the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 far exceeds that of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly 66 transmitted through droplets and close contact, while aerosol is also a potential mode of transmission. 67 Additionally, people of all ages are susceptible to the novel coronavirus, while older males with 68 comorbidities are most vulnerable and more likely to develop severe and even fatal respiratory 69 diseases (7, 20) . The most thorough and strict control measures, including social distancing, limiting the 70 flow of people and transportation, and canceling public activities, have taken effect in China. But the 71 pandemic has spread to more than 200 countries and the best time window for controlling has been 72 missed out. The SARS-CoV-2 seems highly possible to exist for a long time and the world is entering 73 a period of normalized prevention and control. Currently, there is no specific drug for the virus.",

The novel coronavirus was initially isolated from three patients and the 89 complete genome sequences were obtained. The three SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered together 90 within the sarbecovirus subgenus, which shows the typical \u03b2-coronavirus organization: a 5\u2032 91 untranslated region (UTR), replicase complex (orf1ab), S gene, E gene, M gene, N gene, 3\u2032 UTR, 92 and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames (1) . Chinese researchers have found that a 93 gene sequence of coronavirus carried by Chinese rhinolophine is 96% identical with that of 94 SARS-CoV-2, thus rhinolophine is considered as the natural host of SARS-CoV-2 (27, 28) . 95 Unfortunately, the intermediate host has not been determined yet, although it is speculated that 96 pangolin may be the intermediate host. Based on the results of gene comparison, it was showed that 97 SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, 98 bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, and 99",

Currently, more 104 structural and functional studies confirmed that ACE2 acted as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (31, 32) .

Since effective antiviral 113 strategies to control SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections are still lacking, vaccination is still 114 regarded as the major approach for preventing potential re-emergence of SARS-CoV, and more 129 It is known that most of the current influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines, which plays a and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity (61, 62) . Generally, the S protein 189 of coronavirus is functionally divided into the S1 subunit, responsible for receptor binding, and the generating S1 and S2 subunits is located at R694/S695 (67) .

We aligned the sequence of S protein protective immunity (35, (78) (79) (80) . For example, the expression of full-length S protein and its trimer of recombinant S1 or S2 proteins, respectively, and found that anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs were able to 304 abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptor(s), although anti-S1 IgG showed a 305 significantly higher blocking efficiency (106) . As shown in Figure 2B , the amino acid sequences of 306 HR1 and HR2 are highly conserved and homologous between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In fact, 307 these domains are also highly conserved in other coronaviruses (104) , thus the S2 subunit has potential 308 to be used as a target for the development of pan-CoV vaccine against divergent virus strains.",

Very recently, the 116 Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has reported that the global vaccine R&D 117 effort in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in terms of scale and speed. As of 8 118 April 2020, the global COVID-19 vaccine R&D landscape includes 115 vaccine candidates, of 119 which 5 advanced candidates including mRNA-1273 from Moderna, Ad5-nCoV from CanSino 120 Biologicals, INO-4800 from Inovio, and LV-SMENP-DC and pathogen-specific aAPC from 121 Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute have recently moved into clinical development, and the 122 lead developers are mainly in the United States and China.

Although the five critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBM were different 211 with that of SARS-CoV, residue Gln493 provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, 212 consistent with SARS-CoV-2's capacity for human cell infection. Other critical residues in 213 SARS-CoV-2 RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human 214 ACE2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has acquired capacity for human-to-human transmission.215    Phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity216 of animal species (except for mice and rats), implicating that these animal species may act as 217 intermediate hosts or animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infections (30) . S2 subunit of coronavirus is 218 divided into two domains, HR1 and HR2. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 HR1 and HR2 regions 219 are able to interact with each other to form six helix bundle (6-HB), which brings the viral and 220 cellular membranes in close proximity for fusion (64, 77) . As shown in figure 3B, several amino acid 221 residues in HR1 of SARS-CoV-2, which are concentrated from 922 to 943 were variable with 222 SARS-CoV (residues 904-925), while HR2 is completely identical between SARS-CoV-2 and 223 SARS-CoV (not shown), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S2, especially HR2 is a conserved 224 target for pan-coronavirus vaccine. Together, these results suggest that S protein plays an 225 important role in the infection and immunogenicity of coronavirus which promotes some research 226 teams to prepare a vaccine based on full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2. 227 A number of vaccine candidates based on the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV have been 228 reported in succession and generally could induce high level of immune response and potent 229",

            "text": "urbani strain by recombinant baculovirus can induce adequate neutralizing antibody against human231    and palm civet SARS pseudoviruses that bears S proteins of homologous or heterologous 232 SARS-CoV variants (such as Tor2, GD03T13, and SZ3 strains) in vaccinated mice(81)  . These reports233    suggested that the full-length S protein is highly immunogenic and able to induce protection against 234 SARS-CoV challenge. Besides, the neutralizing antibodies alone may be able to suppress virus 235 proliferation. However, the risk in safety and final protective effect of the full-length S protein-based 236 vaccine should not be underestimated. Some groups reported that although full-length S protein of237 SARS-CoV elicited a neutralizing antibody response, it also induced harmful immune responses 238 including triggered infection of human B cells or other immune cells by SARS-CoV, and enhanced SARS-CoV (82-84) . Last year, Liu L. et al identified that anti-S protein IgG, in productively infected 241 lungs, caused severe acute lung injury by skewing inflammation-resolving response in SARS-CoV 242 macaque models. Subsequently, these antibodies were injected into healthy macaques that were then 243 challenged with SARS-CoV. Interestingly, the macaques receiving the antibodies showed more 244 severe lung injury than the control group, indicating that Antibody induced by SARS S protein 245 vaccine candidate may cause antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) (85) . Thus, it is speculated that 246 the S protein of SARS-CoV contains some epitopes, which may induce humoral or cellular immune 247 responses that exacerbate the pathology in some coronavirus infections (86) . Protein Science, an 248 American biotechnology company, once spent tens of millions to make a full-length S-protein 249 vaccine of SARS-CoV. However, the vaccine development was suspended because of the safety 250 problems in the immunized animals. Exactly, Liu G. et al. found that peptide S597-603 of S protein 251 induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates (87) . Perhaps, S 252 protein-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the 253 S597-603 epitope.254 255 3.4 RBD-BASED SUBUNIT VACCINE: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES 256 Full length S protein has been truncated into RBD as a vaccine candidate. RBD of 257 SARS-CoV-S contains major antigenic epitopes that can induce not only neutralizing antibodies but 258 also CD8 + T cell-responses (43, 63, 88-91) . He Y.et al. identified the neutralizing epitopes on the RBD of 259 SARS-CoV-S by a panel of 27 mAbs isolated from the immunized mice. Six structure-dependent 260 epitopes and two adjacent linear epitopes were found, suggesting that the epitopes capable of 261 inducing highly potent neutralizing Ab responses are mainly conformational epitopes (92) . In addition, 262 the neutralizing epitopes in MERS-CoV RBD was confirmed to be mainly conformational as well (93, 263 94) . The modifications in amino acid residues of MERS-CoV-S-RBD based on the structure design 264 could improve its protection against MERS-CoV infection (94) , enlightening that S-RBD or modified 265 S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is promising for the development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.266 We have compared the immunogenicity and immune protection of RBD vaccine with 267 full-length S protein. The results suggested that the RBD, from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, 268 had induced Ab responses with higher titer, more potent neutralizing activity and provided 269 longer-term protection in vivo against SARS-CoV infection compared with that induced by full-length S protein. More importantly, SARS-CoV RBD did not cause immune damage in the 271 animal model while full-length S protein could do (51, 95-97) . It is speculated that there are some 272 super-antigens in the region beyond the RBD of the full-length S protein. In this way, after the 273 full-length S protein enters the animal model, it will induce abundant non-specific antibodies and 274 immune cell activation, subsequently eliciting a large amount of cytokines, which will lead to severe 275 immune damage, just like the pathogenic course of SARS-CoV. But why the antibody titer induced 276 by full-length S protein is not as high as that induced by RBD. It is speculated that the antigen 277 competition might result in a lower level of neutralizing antibody induced by full-length S protein 278 than that induced by RBD. Therefore, RBD-based subunit vaccine may be the ideal and safer 279 alternative for the development of coronavirus vaccine. 280 Interestingly, some groups also found that the recombinant RBDs derived from the S protein of 281 Tor2, GD03, and SZ3, the representative strains of human 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 SARS-CoV 282 and palm civet SARS-CoV, respectively, induced high titers of cross-neutralizing Abs against 283 pseudoviruses expressing S proteins of Tor2, GD03, and SZ3 (98) , suggesting that the major 284 neutralizing epitopes of SARS-CoV are maintained in the process of cross species transmission, thus 285 RBD-based vaccines could induce extensive protection against human and animal SARS-CoV 286 variants. Probably, the RBD of S protein may serve as one of the most effective and safest vaccines 287 for the prevention of SARS. 288 Since both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize ACE2 on the cell surface as the receptor, 289 can RBD-based SARS-CoV-specific vaccines cross protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection? 290 Unfortunately, Ying T. et al. showed that the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing 291antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 292 SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating that the different amino acids in RBD between SARS-CoV and 293 SARS-CoV-2 has an important effect on the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies(99)  .",

Seven asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in the S protein,314    including residues at positions 109, 118, 119, 158, 227, 589 and 699, are crucial for DC-SIGN-or 315 L-SIGN-mediated virus entry(109)  . Notably, a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, 316 CR3022, could bind potently with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, however, the epitope of CR3022 does not 317 overlap with the ACE2 binding site within SARS-CoV-2 RBD (99) , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 318 may also have other receptor binding sites except for ACE2, which should be noted in our vaccine 319 design against SARS-CoV-2. Besides, optimization of sequences, components, or immunization 320 routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants, or application of combinational immunization approaches 321 are usually required for preparing an effective vaccine(110, 111)  .322All these above results indicated that the modification of the SARS-CoV S protein, specifically, 323 by retaining the conserved amino acids, especially the conserved sequence in the RBD region, and 324 removing the possible epitopes that may cause immune damage may be a good strategy to prepare a 325 broad-spectrum vaccine against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-related virus.326 327 4. IMPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SAFE AND BROAD-SPECTRUM VACCINES 328 AGAINST SARS-CoV-2 AND OTHER HUMAN CORONAVIRUSES 329 Very recently, many research teams have launched the development of vaccines against 330 SARS-CoV-2. The safety is a crucial issue that we need to be aware of when making vaccines.331 Meanwhile, there is another issue needs attention. The human and civet isolates of SARS-CoV nestle 332 phylogenetically within the spectrum of SARS-CoV-like (SL-CoV) strains isolated from the bats, 333 and the civets may have served as intermediate amplification hosts that enable SARS-CoV to cross 334 species for animal-to-human transmission (70, 112-115) . Additionally, RNA virus might well mutate in ways that would make previously effective vaccines useless. Thus, development of a safe and effective vaccine against both human and animal SARS-CoV strains is highly important for 337 preventing future SARS outbreaks. On the other hand, given the high prevalence and wide 338 distribution of coronaviruses, increasing human-animal interface activities, the large genetic 339 diversity and frequent recombination of CoV genomes, novel coronaviruses are likely to emerge 340 periodically in humans due to frequent cross-species infections and occasional spillover events. A 341 broad-spectrum SARS vaccine that is effective against all the coronaviruses using ACE2 as their 342 receptor can be applied immediately when we face the recurrent threat of coronavirus. Particularly, 343 taken SARS-CoV-2 as an example, the virus might disappear before the vaccine is developed. 344 Therefore, development of safe and broad-spectrum vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other 345 SARS-CoV-related virus is of great significance for protecting human from CoV infection. Based on 346 the above analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various vaccines against SARS-CoV, the 347 modified S protein is expected to be a candidate for a cross protective vaccine against SARS-CoV 348 and SARS-CoV-related virus. Notably, we have recently demonstrated that a vaccine based on RBD 349 of S protein against SARS-CoV could effectively cross neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, several 350 scientists have tried to design a vaccine against all \u03b2-coronavirus, especially these ACE2-associated 351 ones. 352 In addition to antigens, adjuvants can enhance the immune response and reduce the amount of 353 antigen required for each dose of vaccine, so that more doses of vaccine can be produced and 354 provided to more people. The choice of adjuvants also affects the efficacy of respiratory virus 355 vaccines and adjuvant has also been applied in the R\uff06D of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Lung is a 356 complex organ, which is rich in immune cells, such as macrophages. The pulmonary epithelial cells 357 (AECs) also have the characteristics of some immune cells, such as secreting a large number of 358 pulmonary surfactant A, D (PS-A, PS-D). The PS layer forms a strong barrier to prevent 359 nanoparticles and hydrophilic molecules from accessing them, so as to protect the AECs from 360 pathological damage (116) . Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are the chief immune mediators to protect the 361 body from viral infections, and can be secreted by AECs as well as immune cells following viral 362 infection. Therefore, the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in these two cell types 363 can effectively enhance the production of IFN-I, and recapitulate the immune responses provoked by 364 viral infection (117) . However, it is still a great challenge to delivery STNG agonists into the cytosol of 365 AECs without destroying the integrity of PS layer. Recently, two research teams from China and the 366 United States cooperated to ingeniously use PS-biomimetic liposomes (PS-GAMP) to encapsulated 367 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), a natural and effective from immune surveillance following intranasal immunization. Together with SP-A and SP-D, 370 PS-GAMP enters the alveolar macrophages (AMs), from which PS-GAMP fluxes into AECs through 371 gap junctions between AMs and AECs. Subsequently, the STING pathway in AMs and AECs was 372 activated without breaching PS and alveolar epithelial barriers. Through this mechanism, the 373 adjuvant PS-GAMP combined with inactivated H1N1 vaccine generated broad-spectrum cross 374 protection not only effectively against H1N1, but also against heterosubtypic H3N2, H5N1 and 375 H7N9 virus infection within two days after a single immunization. This cross protection lasted for at 376 least 6 months and induced the persistence of lung CD8 + TRM cells in vivo. It is also showed that 377 PS-GAMP could enhance the recruitment and differentiation of CD11b + dendritic cells (DC) and 378 CD8 + T cells, as well as the humoral response (120) . Thus, PS-GAMP strategy is a promising 379 \"universal\" mucosal adjuvant for developing broad-spectrum vaccines against betacoronavirus 380 lineage B (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, SARSr-CoVs).381 382 5. CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS 383 There was a significantly harmful immune response after immunizing animals with inactivated 384 vaccine against SARS-CoV following challenge with the homotypic virus, although no obvious 385 safety problem was observed in animal model after immunization. In addition, the inactivated 386 vaccine against one serotype of dengue virus (DENV) can enhance individual infection with other 387 serotypes (121) . These observations suggested that harmful response after immunization with 388 inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might also happen. Even if the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 389 vaccine does not elicit serious harmful immune response, it may enhance the infection of the mutated 390 and/or another novel coronavirus by ADE. The subunit vaccine based on RBD can avoid ADE.",

Although this study revealed no exacerbation of infection in the immunized macaques following the challenge with SARS-CoV NS-1, the authors suggested that an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay should be performed in vitro to examine whether the immune sera induced by inactivated vaccine would mediate ADE in some cell lines such as K562, BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally or intramuscularly with MVA/S and 157 neutralizing antibodies were induced.

Simultaneously, regulators should also see strong preclinical evidence that vaccines can prevent infection and we should speed up the R\uff06D progress on the premise of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine(122)  . In addition, the vaccine preparation and adjuvant selection for SARS-CoV-2 in the future should attach great importance to its broad-spectrum cross protection, so that if there is similar virus diseases emerged in humans or animals, the vaccine can be applied immediately to exert its protective effect.Acknowledgments: This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81971474), and Scientific and Technological Research Projects of Colleges and Universities in Hebei Province (ZD2018001).
