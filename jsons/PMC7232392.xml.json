            "text": "Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) is the causative agent of respiratory tract infections and reduced egg production in poultry and has caused global economic losses [1,2]. aMPV was first reported in South Africa in 1978 [3] and was subsequently reported in many countries worldwide. Both aMPV and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) belong to the new Pneumoviridae family, genus Metapneumovirus. There are four subtypes of aMPV, termed A, B, C and D, which are based on genetic and antigenic differences [4]. There is a high similarity between subtype C aMPV and hMPV [5,6,7]. The infection of subtype C aMPV (aMPV/C) in Muscovy ducks has been reported in France and China [8,9] as well as in turkeys and wild birds in the USA [10], forming two distinct genetic lineages, one North American and the other Eurasian. In July 2010, an outbreak with severe respiratory symptoms occurred in meat chickens in southern China. Subsequently, we isolated a subtype C aMPV (aMPV/C), designed strain JC, from the infected chickens and showed that it was the causative agent. This was the first report of chickens infected with aMPV/C [11]. Subsequently, aMPV/C was reported to experimentally infect mice and induce strong inflammation in the lungs [12]. Another research study showed that aMPV/C could induce a complete autophagic response, which was partially regulated by ER stress [13]. However, analysis of proteomic profiles in aMPV/C-infected cells has not yet been described.",

PLKs play multiple roles throughout the cell cycle and have emerged as anticancer therapeutic drug targets [22]. PLK2 was originally regarded as an immediate\u2013early response gene and cell cycle regulator [23,24] and has been reported to display a complex functional response by acting as a cell survival factor [25,26,27] but occasionally as an apoptotic effector [28,29,30,31,32,33,34] in tumorigenesis and certain diseases. PLK2 signaling via p53 is involved in checkpoint signaling and tumor growth [31,35,36,37]. Studies have also revealed that the PLK2 response to oxidative stress is associated with p53 signaling [38,39].",

In the present study, iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS was used to reveal the global proteomic changes occurring in Vero cells in response to aMPV/C infection for the first time and will help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying viral infection. We found that PLK2 expression was upregulated and further examined its biological function in aMPV/C infection. Suppression of PLK2 by small interfering (si)RNA attenuated aMPV/C-induced p53-dependent apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. We also determined the effects of the PLK2 signaling pathway on aMPV/C replication, and found that inhibiting PLK2 decreased virus release at 72 h pi. Our results demonstrate that high PLK2 expression is correlated with induction of apoptosis in aMPV/C-infected Vero cells and facilitates viral release.",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that can mitigate mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis. We transfected cells with PLK-siRNA-739 or treated cells with NAC prior to infecting them with aMPV/C and detected the subsequent apoptosis. Interestingly, suppressing PLK2 partially rescued apoptosis (Figure 6C), indicating that the PLK2 protein may play an essential role in aMPV/C-induced apoptosis.",

In addition, p53 has been intensively studied and found to mediate apoptosis. ROS can regulate p53-dependent apoptosis mediated by mitochondria. PLK2 has been reported to exert an antioxidant function and prevent p53- and ROS-coordinated cell death [39]. However, the opposite effect of PLK2 on p53 and ROS generation has also been observed in high D-glucose-induced apoptosis [41]. To investigate whether PLK2-regulated apoptosis is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, we next measured ROS in cells after aMPV infection. Treatment with PLK2 siRNA was found to decrease ROS production in aMPV/C-infected cells (Figure 7A). However, siRNA-NC treatment did not affect ROS accumulation. We used NAC treatment as a positive control. NAC treatment blocked aMPV/C-induced apoptosis and ROS accumulation (Figure 7A). These results suggest that PLK2 contributes to aMPV/C-induced ROS production. We further studied the effect of PLK2 knockdown on apoptosis markers and found that PLK2 knockdown partially inhibited the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decrease, p53 increase and cleaved caspase-3 activation in aMPV/C-infected cells (Figure 7B). These data suggested that PLK2 induced by aMPV/C infection may contribute to apoptosis through ROS signaling.",

To reveal the mechanism of aMPV/C infection, we need more detailed information. Proteomics, especially iTRAQ combined with LC and tandem MS analysis, is a powerful technology used to quantitatively analyze and identify proteins and can be used to find disease-specific targets in a high-throughput manner. To date, there is no report on the cellular proteome changes after aMPV/C infection. Cultured Vero cells are the best available substrate for aMPV and have been used to study fuctions of aMPV proteins, entry to cells, mediation to membrane fusion, replication, induction of autophagy and vaccine preparation in previous reports [42,43,44,45,46,47]. aMPV/C is more closely related to hMPV and may have larger cellular host ranges potentially including mammalian than other subtypes [12,48]. In this study, iTRAQ was used for the first time to analyze Vero cells infected with aMPV/C. We identified 921 DE proteins at two time points post infection. Three selected DE proteins were confirmed using Western blotting as an independent analytical method. The proteomic results provided valuable data for the further analysis of aMPV/C infection. Bioinformatics indicated that the DE proteins are involved in a variety of processes, including metabolism, biosynthesis, signal transduction, the host response to stress, metabolic pathways, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the AMPK pathway, cell death and the cell cycle (Figure 3 and Figure 4, Table 1). Our data identified several previously uncharacterized key proteins possibly involved in aMPV/C infection of Vero cells.",

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 complexes and phosphorylation of the downstream retinoblastoma (Rb) protein initiate and regulate G1-phase progression. Cyclin E-Cdk2 activity is important in the G1/S transition and S phase. CDK1 is required for entry into mitosis and plays an essential role in S phase.

The proteins in the VTNC, 14-3-3 and RHEB pathways were found to be differentially regulated during aMPV/C infection (Table 1). The MAPK cascade pathways are part of the protein kinase cascade, which involves transcription factors and modulates cell growth, differentiation and inflammation.

The expression of the STAT1, PAK2 and HSPB1 proteins was downregulated in aMPV/C-infected Vero cells (Table 1). Both up- and downregulated proteins are shown. One protein processing pathway, the heat shock response, is a multifunctional mechanism for cell survival following pathogen infection [58]. In this study, Hsp90 and Hsp70 were identified as DE proteins in Vero cells 48 h after aMPV/C infection.

The 14-3-3 proteins represent a family of adaptor and scaffold proteins in eukaryotic organisms. They can interact with multiple cellular proteins and might be involved in modulating the cell cycle, apoptosis and cell death at multiple steps [60]. The 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to be involved in the hepatitis C virus-mediated activation of Raf-1 [61] and HIV-1-induced cell cycle regulation [62]. As shown in Table 1, the decreased expression of three 14-3-3 proteins (eta, beta/alpha, gamma) was found at 48 hpi. We speculate that the inhibition of apoptosis during early infection might contribute to the rapid replication of progeny virions before cell death.

            "text": "In the aMPV/C proteomic data, the proteins with decreased expression were the majority. However, we discovered significant upregulation of PLK2 expression in aMPV/C-infected cells, which was further confirmed by Western blotting. Polo-like kinases are related to serine/threonine protein kinases, which are well-defined cell cycle regulators. PLK2 has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor gene but sometimes plays an oncogenic role in tumors. PLK2 can affect cell cycle regulation and cell survival, which is closely associated with the p53 family and ROS signaling pathway. We found that aMPV/C infection triggers apoptosis and ROS generation in Vero cells, which is inhibited by PLK2 siRNA. Considering that the p53 signaling pathway is involved in aMPV/C infection, the measurement of Bcl-2, Bax, p53 and caspase-3 was performed in aMPV/C-infected Vero cells. The BCL-2 family is a key regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis that comprises proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members. BCL-2 belongs to antiapoptotic proteins. Bax is a proapoptotic effector protein. Specific cellular signaling can modulate the expression of these two kinds of proteins to promote cell survival or death. A family of cysteine proteases called the caspase cascade can mediate the process of apoptosis. Caspase-3 is the final common molecule involved in apoptosis. A decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio can damage the integrity of mitochondria and lead to caspase-3 activation during apoptosis. In our report, suppressing PLK2 inhibited ROS production and reversed the apoptosis marker expression changes, including an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreased cleaved caspase-3 and p53 expression. In the current study, our data collectively suggest for the first time that PLK2 expression contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis and ROS generation in aMPV/C-infected Vero cells. This result demonstrates that PLK2 plays an important role in aMPV/C-induced apoptosis through ROS production and activation of the p53 signaling pathway. To a certain extent, this result is consistent with those of previous reports showing the proapoptotic function of PLK2 but not its antioxidant function [39]. Through further investigation, we demonstrated that the inhibition of PLK2 expression decreases virus production in the supernatant at 72 h pi. We speculate that PLK2 might promote apoptosis for viral release. The findings of this study suggest that PLK2 can regulate p53 and ROS and plays an essential role in apoptosis and viral replication in Vero cells after aMPV/C infection.",

In general, this is the first report of the proteomic profiles of Vero cells following aMPV/C infection using iTRAQ combined with LC-MS. These data provide us comprehensive information about several DE proteins in cellular responses regarding cell cycle, endocytosis, and PI3K-Akt, mTOR, MAPK and p53 signaling pathway in the cultured aMPV/C-infected Vero cells. Furthermore, a high expression of PLK2 by aMPV/C infection promoted apoptosis through ROS accumulation and p53 signaling activation, and release of the virus. However, in-depth analysis of host cellular responses to aMPV/C infection in natural host-chickens will be needed to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms for the development of vaccine strategies and antiviral therapeutic targets for aMPV/C infection in the future.",
