The assays used are previously published assays by Heim et al. (2003) (adenovirus), Le Cann et al. (2004) (astrovirus), Pang et al. (2004) (rotavirus) and van Maarseveen et al. (2010) (sapovirus) (sequences in Table 1\n). These assays have been shown to be sensitive and specific, and to detect all relevant IID causing strains. These assays have been previously validated against conventional PCR methods, and these assays also been accredited by the Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA) and the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS). In addition since implementation in 2004 these assays have been assessed by annual/biannual external QC panels to ensure sensitivity and specificity. Previous attempts to multiplex these four assays into one multiplex assay have failed. The main problems encountered were determined to be due to the astrovirus and rotavirus tests, these assays interacted with other assays in the multiplex causing false negative results. Due to interactions between the assays we used alternative astrovirus and rotavirus assays published by a well established research group Eric Claas \u2013 van Maarseveen et al. (2010) and attempted to multiplex with the existing adenovirus and sapovirus assays (sequences in Table 1). Again these assays have been shown to be sensitive and specific, and to detect all relevant IID causing strains. The astrovirus assay was designed by the Claas group and assessed by assessment of analytical sensitivity and specificity and clinical evaluation of 239 clinical samples. The rotavirus assay used by the Claas group is an adapted version of the Pang et al. rotavirus assay which is established in the WoSSVC laboratory, this same probe with adapted primers was used. The multiplex assay was compared to the existing single assays in use at the WoSSVC.",

Multiplexing single real-time PCR assays by sample type/disease syndrome simplifies the routine service; overall costs are reduced when compared to single testing as rapid diagnosis can reduce unnecessary costs. This is a result of less staff, reagents and machine usage being required for one assay versus four assays, therefore the laboratory can make more adequate use of resources, and reductions in sample turn around times have been achieved by reducing the amount of separate tests needed to be carried out. This ensures more samples can be tested within the working day (Gunson et al., 2008).

Adenovirus was responsible for the majority of the positives detected (52%) followed by sapovirus (20%), astrovirus (16%) and rotavirus (12%). This data highlights the importance of diagnostic screening for these viral pathogens and indicates the need for a multiplex screen that will be both rapid and more cost effective than single assay screening.",

Multiplexing by sample type/disease syndrome simplifies the routine service; overall costs are reduced when compared to single testing as rapid diagnosis can reduce unnecessary antibiotic usage and investigations. Reductions in sample turn around times have been achieved by reducing the amount of separate tests needed to be carried out. This ensures more samples can be tested within the working day (Gunson et al., 2008).",
