They are associated with otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia. Annually, the economic impact of HRV infections costs billions in healthcare and lost productivity. Since 1987, 100 officially recognised HRV serotypes reside in two genetically distinct species; HRV A and HRV B, within the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. Sequencing of their $ 7kb genomes was finalised in 2009. Since 1999, many globally circulating, molecularly-defined 'strains', perhaps equivalent to novel serotypes, have been discovered but remain uncharacterised. Many of these currently unculturable strains have been assigned to a proposed new species, HRV C although confusion exists over the membership of the species. There has not been sufficient sampling to ensure the identification of all strains and no consensus criteria exist to define whether clinical HRV detections are best described as a distinct strain or a closely related variant of a previously identified strain (or serotype). We cannot yet robustly identify patterns in the circulation of newly identified HRVs (niHRVs) or the full range of associated illnesses and more data are required. Many questions arise from this new found diversity: what drives the development of so many distinct viruses compared to other species of RNA viruses? What role does recombination play in generating this diversity? Are there species-or strain-specific circulation patterns and clinical outcomes? Are divergent strains sensitive to existing capsid-binding antivirals?

With the advent of diagnostic PCR, it became apparent that HRV infections are the most frequent of viral respiratory infections, even in hospitalised young children [23, [37] [38] [39] . While the first classical HRV strain sequences were lodged onto GenBank in 1994 [40] , it was not until 1999, using specimens collected in 1992-1995 [41] , that the first hint of new HRV diversity appeared ( < 98% identity with classical strains in the 5 0 nontranslated region (NTR)). In 2006, using phylogeny of 1A/1B sequences from HRV positive specimens collected in 2003, we announced a distinct and previously undefined clade of HRVs [42] which was quickly followed by a report of related HRV strains among some cases of a 2004/2005 CFLI outbreak in New York [43] . Global identification of clade members ensued [15, 36, 37, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] and it now seems that the much overlooked HRVs have been brought in from the cold. In our opinion, the current HRV discovery phase is ongoing, not, as was once suggested, largely complete [61] ; there will be descriptions of many more novel strains in the years to come. The niHRV strains do not appear to be emerging viruses in that they have likely not arisen from a recent zoonotic event [62] but have instead been circulating for at least a decade [49, 52] and probably much longer [51] , without previous detection. Historically, HRV culture was fraught with unreliability and continues to fail in all attempts to isolate niHRVs [1, 57] . Even when using a strain-typing PCR, HRV Cs have been missed if the HRV-positive patient specimens had first Cell lines used to attempt HRV C isolations are listed. *Recurrent attacks of shortness of breath and wheezing caused by spasmodic contraction of the bronchi, attributed to infection.

By overcoming the insensitivity of culture, PCR with subsequent sequencing produced a large number of diverse viral discoveries from within the human respiratory tract [1, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . Unfortunately, the inclusion of HRV screening has not yet become as accepted as it has become for other respiratory viruses including human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), influenza viruses (IFVs), parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) and metapneumovirus (HMPV) [70] [71] [72] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 333, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 334, "end": 338, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 339, "end": 343, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 344, "end": 348, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 431, "end": 435, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 500, "end": 504, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 791, "end": 795, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 916, "end": 920, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 969, "end": 973, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 974, "end": 977, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 978, "end": 981, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 982, "end": 986, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 987, "end": 991, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 992, "end": 996, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1006, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1011, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1016, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1021, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1026, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1031, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1036, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1041, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1046, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1056, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1071, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1467, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1528, "text": "[49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1709, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1713, "text": "57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2032, "end": 2037, "text": "[165]", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2067, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2241, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2246, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2251, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2256, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2261, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2262, "end": 2266, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2271, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2533, "end": 2537, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2542, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2543, "end": 2547, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NEW RHINOVIRUS DIVERSITY: ACKNOWLEDGING THE ELEPHANT IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT"}, {"text": "HRVs were one of the clinical virology laboratory's earliest targets for conventional PCR [73] .

The viral genome is directly or indirectly responsible for a virus' antigenic and immunogenic potential, seasonal and epidemic circulation patterns, response to antiviral and vaccine interventions and clinical effects; factors which contribute to the impact of the virus. Genome deduction and characterisation and the development of strain-defining criteria are the first requirements for robust analysis and definition of respiratory viruses without which we cannot reduce the burden of infection. Strain-specific molecular epidemiology studies are rare for the HRV super-group [1] despite these being commonplace for the less populated respiratory virus species such as HMPV and HRSV. When Kistler et al. described the HRVs as being under 'purifying' selective pressure [105] (environmental forces that encourage each strain to remain intact, once formed) they described a very important feature of some, if not all members [106] , of the heavily populated HRV group; their unexpected ability to remain largely unchanged over time. This can be seen during molecular epidemiology studies as high levels of conservation ( > 96% nucleotide identity) among variants of the same strain detected over the same time period. We saw this when studying the complete 1A, 1B and 1D regions of 17 variants of HRV-QPM detected throughout 2003 in Queensland, Australia in which we defined a 96% nucleotide identity threshold to identify HRVC-QPM variants. It should be noted that we used highly specific rtPCR assays which may have limited the diversity we saw within this strain.

Ten protease cleavage sites, common to all enteroviruses, are predicted to cleave each HRV C polyprotein into typical picornavirus structural (VP1-4) and non-structural proteins (2A-C and 3A-D, [109] [110] [111] ). The VP1/2A junction of HRVC-N4 and NY074 VP1/2A junction consists of the more HRV A-like V/G scissile bond whereas the same HRVC-N10 junction consists of an L/D cleavage site, unique among the HRVs. HRVC-N10 also has an unusual Asp insertion at position 2 in VP1. A translation initiation site (MGAQVS) shared with all other HRVs and motifs (YGDD, YGL, TFLKR and SIRWT) including those crucial for RNA polymerase binding shared by HRV-As, HRV-Bs and HEVs [112, 113] are present within most HRV C strains; HRVC-N4 and -N10 have SFLKR.

Key residues on the VP1 BC loop involved in receptor contact with the VLDLR [116] are missing in strains from HRV C and there are differences in the HI loop compared to the classical strains.
