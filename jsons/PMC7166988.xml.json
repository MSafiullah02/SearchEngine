It can cause mild to severe respiratory infections. More recently, circulation of three different EV\u2010D68 clades based on the phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences has been reported worldwide [Kaida et al., 2011; Rahamat\u2010Langendoen et al., 2011; Ikeda et al., 2012; Lauinger et al., 2012; Linsuwanon et al., 2012; Meijer et al., 2012; Piralla et al., 2012; Tokarz et al., 2012]. A nationwide outbreak of EV\u2010D68 associated with severe respiratory infection was reported in the USA from mid\u2010August 2014 to January 15, 2015 and a total of 1,153 people were affected during this epidemic (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html). The EV\u2010D68 outbreaks in the USA have resulted in a worldwide public health concern with emergences of EV\u2010D68 infections in Denmark, Australia, France, and Italy [Bal et al., 2015; Esposito et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2015; Midgley et al., 2015]. In China, sporadic cases of EV\u2010D68 were reported between August 2006 and June 2012 [Xiang et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2014]. In a previous study, we identified one EVD68 strain in a respiratory specimen from a severe pneumonia case in Beijing in 2014 [Zhang et al., 2015]. There have been no further reports about the EV\u2010D68 infection in Beijing since then, especially after the US EV\u2010D68 pandemic in 2014.",

To understand the EV\u2010D68 circulation in Beijing, we investigated the clinical specimens from patients with respiratory infections for EV\u2010D68 during the period 2011\u20132015. In this study, the rate of EV\u2010D68 (0.20%) in Beijing is lower than the rates reported in Italy (0.24%) [Piralla et al., 2014], the Netherlands (0.95%) [Poelman et al., 2015], Philippines (1.10%) [Furuse et al., 2015], Germany (7.70%) [Reiche et al., 2015], Denmark (10.80%) [Midgley et al., 2015], and Norway (11.00%) [Bragstad et al., 2015]. The low rate of EV\u2010D68 detected in this study may be a consequence of the sampling method as the clinical specimens were collected from all age groups. Adults accounted for 56.5% of the respiratory infection cases while EV\u2010D68 mainly affects children. In addition, this could be a result of sampling time frame with no EV\u2010D68 infections detected in Beijing during the period of January to July of 2015, which is not the EV\u2010D68 circulating season.",

Our study indicates that EV\u2010D68 could also cause the respiratory infection in the summer and winter. The phylogenetic relationship between EV\u2010D68 strains circulating in Beijing, China, and other countries showed that EV\u2010D68 strains from Beijing circulating in 2011 to 2013 belonged to group 1 or 3, while all of the strains in 2014 belonged to group 1 together with the strains circulating in the USA in 2014. In 2011, some other EV\u2010D68 strains from China were clustered into group 1 together with the strains circulating in the USA. The Beijing EV\u2010D68 strains in group 1 were also shown to be closely related to the USA reference strain in 2014 by evolutionary distance estimation. These results demonstrated that EV\u2010D68 strains similar to those circulating in the USA in 2014 already existed in China from 2011 and became predominant strains circulating in Beijing in 2014.",
