Macrophages support tissues by remodeling, secreting growth and angiogenic factors, and phagocytosing apoptotic cells. Virchow first described the presence of leukocytes in human tumours in 1863 and suggested that cancer originates in sites of chronic inflammation (Balkwill and Mantovani 2001) . Wounding of normal tissues results in the production of numerous growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, all of which recruit and differentiate circulating monocytes to tissues. Tumour cells have been found to produce similar growth factors and cytokines that recruit macrophages to tumours (Condeelis and Pollard 2006) . Further, there is an emerging characterization of macrophage activation by tumour-derived ligands of Tolllike receptors (TLRs), a family of transmembrane proteins initially characterized as sensors of infection.",

Several in vivo studies have supported these clinical observations: mice deficient in CSF-1 and thus deficient in macrophages (Wiktor-Jedrzejczak et al. 1990 ), when crossed with mice prone to develop metastatic breast cancer, develop the same numbers of breast tumours but nearly no metastases (Lin et al. 2001) . The role that TLR signaling may have in stimulating macrophages to become tumour promoting is not clearly defined. However, given the role that macrophages play in restoring tissue homeostasis such as in the tissue repair response, it is likely that tumour-induced TLR signaling will provide macrophages with signals of persistent injury in need of repair. In this chapter, we review the molecular determinants of TLR signaling, the role TLR signaling plays in infection, wound healing, and tumourigenesis and discuss how TLR signaling in TAMs may result in tumour progression.",

Specificity of this response is, in part, determined by the combination of adaptor molecules that associate with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of TLRs. These adaptors have in common a TIR domain. The five known TIR domain-containing adaptors of TLRs are MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88), TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon beta; also known as TICAM-1), TIRAP (also known as MAL), TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule), and SARM (Sterile-alpha and Armadillo motif-containing protein) (O'Neill and Bowie 2007) . TLR signaling can be divided into two signaling pathways depending on whether they use either MyD88 or TRIF as adaptor molecules. The downstream targets vary in that MyD88 induces inflammatory cytokines, whereas TRIF induces type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. TRAM and TIRAP are bridging adaptors that help to recruit and bind TRIF to TLR4 and MyD88 to TLR2, respectively (Takeuchi and Akira 2010) . SARM functions as a negative regulator of NF-kB and IRF activation by blocking TRIF-dependent transcription factor activation (Carty et al. 2006 ).",

Further, the appropriate immune response is determined by the general class of pathogen as determined by the detected TLR ligands. For instance, TLR4 recognizes LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, while TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria.",

However, more recently, an increasing number of endogenous, self ligands have been identified and characterized (Karin et al. 2006; Kawai and Akira 2010) . These endogenous ligands have in common their association with either infection or tissue destruction and cell death. Therefore, the ligands are more accurately described as altered self rather than self. Most of these endogenous ligands are released during tissue damage, such as that observed in tumour progression. The emerging list of endogenous ligands is complicated by the potential contamination of reagents with exogenous, pathogen-associated products. Therefore, biochemical analysis demonstrating direct interaction between endogenous ligands and TLRs will be required to address the skepticism that presently exists. Identification and characterization of endogenous ligands may be especially relevant to TAMs, as many tumours exist in a sterile environment.

HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1) is a nuclear protein that can bind chromatin that is released during cell necrosis or inflammation (Scaffidi et al. 2002; Wang et al. 1999 ). HMGB1 has been reported to be recognized by a variety of TLRs including TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 (Sims et al. 2010) . In models of ischemiareperfusion and septic shock, HMGB1 is proinflammatory. Neutralizing antibodies against HMGB1 in the TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 background are both protective in the ischemiareperfusion model, suggesting that endogenous, non-pathogen-derived proinflammatory signaling is mediated through TLR4 (Tsung et al. 2005b ). Further, other HMGB proteins -namely HMGB1, HMGB2, and HMGB3 have been found to function as universal sentinels for nucleic acids that can activate a variety of PRRs including TLRs, NLRs (NOD-like receptors), and RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors) (Yanai et al. 2009 ). As a DNA-binding protein, HMGB1 can bind both host-and pathogen-derived DNA. When the HMGB1-nucleic acid complex binds the RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) receptor, it is endocytosed and presented to TLR9, where it leads to the activation of DCs and B cells (Tian et al. 2007) . How the release of HMGB1 is regulated, whether through a non-classical secretory lysosomal pathway or during necrosis, has not yet been determined. However, the release of HMGB1 was found to be dependent on the cytosolic NLR, NLRP3, and its adaptor ASC (apoptotic speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) but independent of caspase-1 in a lung infection model (Willingham et al. 2009 ). Whether there is a physiologic correlate to controlled HMGB1 release has yet to be determined. However, HMGB1 is highly expressed in a variety of solid tumours including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Further, this elevated expression of HMGB1 is associated with tumour progression and metastasis (Ellerman et al. 2007 ). One consequence of TLR signaling in TAMs by endogenous ligands was suggested in a report of the induction of apoptosis in activated T cells by TAMs that were stimulated by unidentified tumour-derived TLR4 ligands (Liu et al. 2010) .",

Further, this increased DSS-induced intestinal damage was similar to that seen in MyD88 deficient mice, indicating that signals from the commensal bacteria is important in tissue preservation (Rakoff-Nahoum et al. 2004) . One mechanism by which TLR signaling may result in tissue protection is the delivery of anti-apoptotic signals to cells, preventing cell loss. This may allow TLR signaling to establish the threshold of tolerable injury and cell death. Downstream products of TLR signaling such as cyclooxygenase-2 provide a signal for progenitor cells to proliferate, restoring the damaged tissue.",

Ischemia followed by reperfusion results in inflammation and oxidative stress of the affected tissue. In various models of ischemia-reperfusion including liver, kidney, heart, and brain, TLR4-deficient mice are relatively protected (Oyama et al. 2004; Tang et al. 2007; Tsung et al. 2005b; Wu et al. 2007 ). The cells in which TLR signaling is critical for this pathology vary. For instance, in the liver, the abrogation of TLR4 signaling in hematopoietic cells is protective (Tsung et al. 2005a) , whereas in the kidney, the abrogation of TLR4 signaling in parenchymal cells is protective (Zhang et al. 2008) . HMGB1 is an endogenous TLR ligand that is upregulated in both liver and kidney after ischemia-reperfusion. Antibodies that bind and deplete HMGB1 after liver ischemia-reperfusion are protective of subsequent tissue damage. Further, the depletion of HMGB1 in mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR4 does not confer any additional protection from tissue pathology (Tsung et al. 2005b ). This suggests that the protection conferred in the TLR2 and TLR4 deficient mouse model is due to the loss of signaling downstream of TLR ligand HMGB1. Two extracellular matrix proteins known to be endogenous TLR ligands, biglycan and hyaluronan, are induced by ischemia-reperfusion ), but their role in mediating tissue injury has yet to be determined.",

In contrast, Virchow suggested in the nineteenth century that sites of chronic inflammation are the origin of some cancers (Balkwill and Mantovani 2001) . Experimental models have demonstrated evidence supporting both of these observations, with TLR signaling leading to either the regression or the promotion of various tumour types. Further, genetic association studies have linked polymorphisms within various TLR loci (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR10) to an increased risk of prostate, breast, colorectal, and nasopharyngeal cancers (El-Omar et al. 2008; Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov 2009 ).

However, an adaptive immune response stemming from these destructive therapies was determined to affect clinical outcome. In mice and humans, dying tumour cells treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy release the nuclear protein HMGB1, which activates the TLR4-MyD88 pathway in DCs leading to tumour antigen-specific T-cell immunity. The activation of TLR4 by HMGB1 is essential for efficient cross-presentation of tumour antigens and effective antitumour response.

Apc min/+ MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice had fewer and smaller polyps than Apc min/+ mice; however, the number of microadenomas was not different between the Apc min/+ MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice and the Apc min/+ mice. Similarly, in azoxymethane-induced carcinogenesis, the incidence of tumour formation was decreased in the MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, MyD88 signaling is essential for tumour progression but not initiation (Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov 2007) .",

Yet, few tumour-derived TLR ligands that activate TAMs to promote tumour progression and metastasis have been identified and characterized. One clear example was the product of a biochemical screen of macrophage-activating factors secreted by tumours. The extracellular matrix protein versican produced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells induced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF by macrophages through TLR2/TLR6 signaling. Further, direct binding of TLR2 to versican was demonstrated. Abrogation of signaling through TLR2/TLR6 and MyD88 resulted in increased survival and fewer metastases in a murine model of metastatic lung cancer (Kim et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "Tumour progression has long been associated with inflammation. In particular, increased macrophage density in solid tumours as well as lymphomas has been associated with a poorer prognosis. Inherent to cancer is the loss of normal tissue architecture, which may provide signals or perpetual tissue stress and damage. Cancers have been compared with wounds that do not heal (Dvorak 1986 ) and they both have significant overlap in their gene expression signatures (Chang et al. 2004 ). Among the signals for tissue damage are endogenous TLR ligands. As macrophages have the physiologic role of restoring tissue integrity and homeostasis after tissue damage, cancers exploit them as a rich source of growth factors and angiogenic factors (Pollard 2009 ). Future therapeutic opportunities to modulate the progression of cancer will come from understanding the signals produced by tumours, and the pathways they educate macrophages into trophic TAMs. In addition, early studies suggest that TLR signaling may enable the production of an acquired immune response and, therefore, a more durable remission after treatment. Dissecting and modulating both the trophic and acquired immune responses from TLR signaling will be challenging but will have great therapeutic promise.",
