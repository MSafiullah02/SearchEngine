A recent preprint revealed nonspecific beneficial effects of universal BCG vaccination on hindering COVID-19 spread and its complications in some countries (e.g., Japan).24 The observed differing COVID-19 mortality rates across countries allow hypothesizing that increasing/implementing BCG vaccination may be protective during this pandemic, particularly in countries with no mandatory vaccination policy.

Surprisingly, elderly (60\u201385 years) and middle-age (40\u201359) patients, who presented with lower lymphocyte counts and higher level inflammatory markers, produced significantly higher amounts of neutralizing antibodies than younger (15\u201339) patients.35 Another Chinese cohort study demonstrated that 9% of recovered patients repetitively present with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 symptoms within 17 days of recovery, pointing to high baseline viral load, various immune dysfunctions, and virus persistence.36 Interestingly, a large Chinese study (n = 173) of seroconversion and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rates revealed that total antibodies against the virus were present in about 40% of patients within 1st week of disease onset and in all patients after 2 weeks.37 During the same periods, RNA detectability decreased from 67% to 45%,36 raising concerns that not all specific antibodies are able to neutralize the virus.

Such protective measures can primarily save lives of high-risk individuals, such as children, pregnant women, medics, patients with underlying immunosuppressive and other chronic diseases, and the elderly. It is hypothesized that individuals regularly vaccinated against some infections, such measles and tuberculosis, may demonstrate better outcomes when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Considering all safety issues, high-risk populations should undergo regular vaccinations to train their immunity and actively produce antibodies that may cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Given the limitations of the cross-reactivity, particularly exhaustion of active immune response over time and with aging, passive antibody therapy can be indicated in subjects with early symptoms of COVID-19 and those with recent contacts with patients.
