These credit groups also provide money as start-up capital for small businesses. Most of these social credit groups are comprised of women who donate cash to a group account organized by the group members.

Most developing countries suffer shortages of well trained-health personnel which have contributed to the underperformance of health systems and primary health care. Is it possible to create saving and credit cooperatives that can support health research and health service delivery in developing countries? A concept of micro Research or microgrants was put forward where small grants could be provided to researchers in developing countries (Boccia et al. 2011; Geissler and Leatherman 2015; Kollmann et al. 2015; Seiber and Robinson 2007). The challenges associated with this concept though, have been that most often the donors for the microgrants already have selected subjects that they are interested in, which most often are not the pressing needs in the affected countries (MacDonald and Kabakyenga 2008). Secondly, this is not a sustainable solution as microgrants are only given for a short period of time and when the grant runs out, the study is abandoned. This creates not only false hopes in the communities where the studies are conducted but also a lack of trust in groups that come with health interventions into the community due to lack of long-term benefits.\nand Human Development\n\nThe BRAC Story\n\n",

Instead of improving their livelihoods, to some microfinance has plunged them into utter poverty. This has led to lack of willingness in participating in development projects with a microfinance component. This has also led to the development of local microfinance schemes based in social networks within the community. Since members decide on the conditions of repayment, the conditions are manageable. Most people in rural areas in developing countries are already struggling with poverty and while microfinance schemes might provide financial security to some, shocks such as disease can easily affect the financial stability of a poor household. In case of illness within the household, finances might be easily channelled from businesses to support the health expenditures, thereby affecting the business. For the very poor, microfinance schemes may seem out of their reach, because they have neither the resources nor collateral to obtain the loans (Buckley 1997; Littlefield et al. 2003; Nasir 2013; Swope 2007). Training schemes that can instill skills in disciplines such as sustainable agriculture, and how communities can use the available resources sustainably at the same time improving their livelihoods, could also be of greater benefit to the rural poor.",

At an individual level, diversification in markets and ways of making a living can also aid in raising social capital and status. Better-off families are able to diversify more favourably than poor families as they possess the financial and social capital that is lacking in the poor families. Delivery of quality education and training in rural areas is required to attain sustainable rural livelihoods. Owing to low human capital, the rural poor tend to diversify in less profitable labour markets than their wealthier counterparts. The rural poor will mostly be involved in part-time and casual labour that does not require skills. As a result the poor make very little income, which results in failure to create opportunities that could earn them more money, and they are denied opportunities to improve their status\u2014an example of low human capital (Ellis 1996).",

Changes in land use patterns have led to people encroaching into forest areas bringing individuals into close proximity to wild animals and new pathogens. Due to the growing global population, people are moving into areas that were uninhabited in search for land for agriculture and for construction of homes, and for pasture lands to sustain their livestock.

Conflicts have resulted in breakdown of public health measures, including vaccinations and surveillance; populations from these regions may miss out on vaccinations necessary to protect them from certain infectious diseases.
