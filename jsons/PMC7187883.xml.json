These drug aerosols experience mass change due to the interaction of aerosol and water vapor in the respiratory tract, which is a complex process because it depends upon local flow and particle characteristics, thermodynamics, airway structure, and lung function (Finlay, 2001; Longest & Kleinstreuer, 2005; Martonen, 1982). A better understanding of the aerosol-water vapor interaction in the airways could potentially help the design of effective inhalers that engineer the aerosol size for targeted drug delivery (Byron, 2004; Longest, Tian, Walenga, & Hindle, 2012; Walenga & Longest, 2016).",

            "text": "Recent studies have focused on the shrinkage or growth of particles for various airway conditions and its impact on the deposition of drugs in the airways (Chen, Feng, Zhong, & Kleinstreuer, 2017; Chen, Kleinstreuer, Zhong, Feng, & Zhou, 2018; Longest, McLeskey, & Hindle, 2010). However, tailoring efficient drug delivery methods and devices for asthmatic patients poses numerous experimental challenges due to inaccuracy in measuring and quantifying the regional deposition of particles (dosage) in the airways (Borgstr\u00f6m, Bengtsson, Derom, & Pauwels, 2000). Although several computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have been performed for particle growth in the mouth-throat and airway model, very few have focused on the effect of subject-specific airways with realistic boundary conditions (Chen et al., 2017; Chen, Ma, Zhong, Sun, & Zhou, 2019; Winkler-Heil, Ferron, & Hofmann, 2014; Zhang, Kleinstreuer, & Kim, 2006). The change in the size of pharmaceutical particles is due to evaporation and condensation (hygroscopicity) when traveling in the respiratory tract (Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Finlay, 2001). During the hygroscopic process of a sodium chloride (NaCl) particle, water vapor would be absorbed from surrounding air to form a film of saturated NaCl solution that covers a NaCl crystal (Asgharian, 2004; Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Chen et al., 2017). As the hygroscopic process continues, the mass of solid NaCl decreases and the saturated NaCl solution increases until solid NaCl is fully dissolved (Asgharian, 2004; Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Chen et al., 2017). Several previous works on the growth of hygroscopic particles in the human airways showed that an increase in particle size enhances the particle deposition throughout the airways (Chen et al., 2019; Ferron, Kreyling, & Haider, 1988; Ferron, Oberd\u00f6rster, & Henneberg, 1989; Hofmann, 2011; Martonen, 1982). For example, Ferron et al. (1989) found that for particles with an initial diameter of 0.5\u20132 \u03bcm in a constant relative humidity (RH) environment, the hygroscopic process could significantly alter the particle size by a factor of 2 to 4. Chen et al. (2017) tested the hygroscopic growth of multi-component particles, comprising water, ethanol, NaCl and fluorescein, in a generalized mouth-throat model with various boundary conditions at the inlet and boundary walls, such as volumetric flow rate and wall wetness. They found that for particles with an initial diameter of 2.5\u20137.5 \u03bcm a wet wall (RH = 99.5%) condition increases the deposition efficiency by 2.1%, as compared with 0.5% obtained with a dry airways wall condition (RH = 0%). In a numerical study of hygroscopic particle growth of NaCl, Chen et al. (2019) reported that a constant RH of 99.5% at the airway wall over-predicted the final particle diameter by 18% in the airways of generation 3\u20136, indicating the importance of this boundary condition.",

Thus, the notion of subject-specificity for tailoring drug delivery could potentially be realized through cluster-specificity. For example, Choi et al. (2017) identified four asthmatic clusters using computed tomography (CT) imaging-based variables and established their associations with clinical characteristics. Later, J. Choi, LeBlanc, et al. (2019) and Choi, Yoon, et al. (2019) applied a CFD model to examine air flow and deposition of non-growth particles within archetypes representative of the four imaging-based clusters. Although subjects in cluster 3 (without airway constriction) and cluster 4 (with airway constriction) were characteristic of severe asthma, they exhibited different particle deposition patterns with increasing initial particle size. Specifically, cluster 4 subjects had an increase in the deposition fraction in the left lower lobe (LLL) for particles with a diameter larger than 2 \u03bcm.",

Choi et al., 2019). A CFD model was implemented to predict the transport and deposition of dry NaCl particles in archetypes selected from two severe asthmatic clusters. Cluster 3 (C3) subjects had non-constricted airways, while cluster 4 (C4) subjects had constricted airways. In this study, only the growth of NaCl particles was considered due to the high affinity of NaCl particles to absorb moisture from the surrounding air compared to pharmaceutical drugs. The effects of particle growth for a range of dry initial particle sizes in each cluster were investigated on the deposition pattern and final particle sizes in the airways, specifically in LLL, where airway narrowing exists.",

Thus, the gravitational direction is not exactly parallel to the trachea. The 3D segmented airway geometry and skeleton were then input into an in-house code to automatically construct a subject-specific 3D-1D coupled airway geometrical model, which contains anatomical information and meshes for CFD (Miyawaki, Tawhai, Hoffman, Wenzel, & Lin, 2017). The CT images, however, did not include the upper airways. To mimic the effects of the upper airways, we employed a laryngeal model to create a glottal constriction in the trachea that could generate a turbulent jet on inspiration (Miyawaki, Hoffman, & Lin, 2017).",

The 3D mesh grid size was computed using the branch diameters and flow rates in order to preserve the grid size in terms of wall units in every branch (Miyawaki, Hoffman, et al., 2017). The grid size in wall units y+ was computed based on the following equation.(5)y+=\u0394xbrQ,bDb3Where \u0394xb is the branch grid size, rQ,b is the flow rate ratio of branch to trachea and Db is the branch diameter. A non-uniform mesh was generated in each branch to capture the turbulent effect accurately, for more detail on the meshing algorithm implemented see (Miyawaki, Hoffman, et al., 2017).",

The air volume change data were used to derive local compliance coefficients for a 1D resistance model. Then, dynamic flow rate distributions at terminal bronchioles were derived from a 1D resistance simulation, which were then used to generate CFD flow rate boundary conditions for CT resolved airways (S. Choi et al., 2019). Contrary to previous numerical studies that used a fixed volumetric flow rate (QPI) at peak inhalation (Chen et al., 2017, 2019; Feng, Kleinstreuer, Castro, & Rostami, 2016; Zhang, Kleinstreuer, Kim, & Cheng, 2004), we employed the subject-specific maximum volumetric flow rate (QPI) derived from the CT images, with inspiratory capacity (IC) shown in Table 1. We fixed the peak inhalation time at 1.25 s to mimic the characteristic inhalation waveform for slow and deep breathing using an MDI with the inhalation period of 5.0 s for all subjects. The waveform was proposed by Longest et al. (2012) based on package insert instructions. The QPI value is essential when studying hygroscopic particle growth since the flow rate determines the amount of time for particle-water vapor interaction. At the airway wall, a no-slip boundary condition was imposed.",

Most of the existing studies assumed a wet wall condition where the temperature (37 \u00b0C) and relative humidity (RH = 99.5%) were fixed at the airways wall (Asgharian, 2004; Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Ferron et al., 1988; Longest et al., 2012). A fixed airway wall temperature or using simple function of distance from mouth may lead to inaccurate prediction of temperature distribution within the airway since during inspiration the airway wall is cooled due to evaporation and heat transfer (Winkler-Heil et al., 2014; Zhang, Kim, et al., 2006). The wall boundary conditions for Equations (3), (4) are estimated from a 1D two-layer wall model where the first layer captures the transient prediction, and the other layer captures the steady approximation (Wu, Miyawaki, Tawhai, Hoffman, & Lin, 2015). The two-layer model predicts the heat conduction between the airway wall tissue layer of thickness 0.5 mm and the airway surface liquid (ASL) layer of thickness 10 \u03bcm, where on inspiration heat and humidity are transferred to the air from the airway wall until isothermal saturation is reached (Wu et al., 2014). For Equations (3), (4), a Dirichlet boundary condition of 303 K and RH = 35% was imposed at the entrance of the trachea. At the end of the terminal bronchioles, a Neumann condition was imposed (Wu et al., 2014). Once the velocity, temperature, and water vapor concentration (absolute humidity) fields were obtained, the particle transport and growth models described in the following sections were solved.",

Li et al. (1992), the size of the NaCl particles was sorted using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA). The particles were then allowed to flow into a wetted-wall tube reactor where the hygroscopic growth occurred with the air stream fixed at RH > 99%. Once the particles reached an equilibrium state, the aerosol diameter was measured with a second DMA associated with a condensation nucleus counter. For any given initial particle diameter, the experiment was repeated multiple times to obtain a mean diameter of the hygroscopically grown particle. In Table 2\n, the parameters used were obtained from the study (Chen et al., 2017). We assumed a steady-state condition by fixing the temperature and humidity of the air stream entering the simulated tube reactor to 37 \u00b0C, RH = 99% and 22 \u00b0C, RH = 99.5% (W. Li et al., 1992). The numerical simulation used dry NaCl particles with initial diameters ranging from 10 to 200 nm. The model used here assumed a rapid mixing of dissolved salt in the droplet so that a concentration gradient within the particle is ignored, which is a reasonable assumption for NaCl when modeling hygroscopic particle growth (Asgharian, 2004; Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Chen et al., 2018). In Equation (12), the water activity coefficient (\u03b3wxw=1\u2212ixsxw) was approximated based on Chen et al. (2017) and Finlay (2001) for a dilute NaCl solution. The van't Hoff factor used here (i=1.85) was experimentally determined. xs and xw are the mole fraction of salt and water, respectively (Chen et al., 2017; Finlay, 2001).",

Li et al., 1992) for dry NaCl particles with initial diameters ranging from 10 to 200 nm at two different conditions. The growth ratio here was calculated by taking the equilibrium particle diameter (dp) and dividing by the initial particle diameter (ddry). The model prediction at both conditions shows an increase of growth ratio with increasing initial particle diameter. The predicted growth ratios here are for a fixed RH = 99% (solid black circle) and RH = 99.5% (solid black square). Previous studies showed that a small change in relative humidity (RH > 98%) could significantly impact the growth ratio and the time to reach the equilibrium size (Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Haddrell et al., 2017; Winkler-Heil et al., 2014). The discrepancies between the model prediction and experimental data are due to several factors. First, the growth ratio shown in Fig. 2 heavily depends on the RH, which was measured by W. Li et al. (1992) with an accuracy of 1% as RH approaches 100%. As shown in Fig. 2, a change in RH by 0.5% increased the growth ratio by approximately \u223c1.0, when the initial particle diameter was fixed at 200 nm. Second, the sensitivity of particle growth model discussed above to thermophysical properties such as diffusion coefficient (D\u02dce), thermal conductivity (\u03bb\u02dcg), and saturation vapor pressure (Pve,sat) are well-studied, indicating a difference in growth ratio about \u223c1.45 using thermophysical properties from various studies (Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Chen et al., 2017). Although there exists a mismatch between the model prediction and experimental data, the agreement between them could be further improved by adjusting the RH in the growth model by \u00b1 0.2\u20130.5%, depending on initial particle diameter.",

As for temperature variation in the boxed region, the temperature decreased approximately by 2 \u00b0C in the C4 subject (Fig. 3 (c)) compared to the C3 subject (Fig. 3 (d)). The change in temperature in the boxed region of the C4 subject is due to rapid cooling in association with reduced airway surface area and increased airflow speed. Similar to the temperature field, we focus on the water vapor concentration in the boxed region of Fig. 3 (e) and (f), which is about 0.039 kg/m3 for the C3 subject and 0.035 kg/m3 for the C4 subject. A slight decrease in local water vapor concentration is associated with an increase in airflow speed and a decrease in temperature. The water vapor concentration in the airways has a greater impact on the particle trajectory since different water vapor concentration may lead to different particle size, which subsequently affects the deposition site in the airways due to size change and particle momentum.",

The average DF increases as the initial particle size varied from 1 to 8 \u03bcm since the particles that would be advected deeper into the airways now deposited on the airway wall. This is true for both cases with and without hygroscopic particle growth. As expected, with particle growth, the average DF increases. The difference in DFs between with and without growth is most evident for particles with an initial diameter of 4 \u03bcm, viz. about 3% in the C3 subjects and 6% in the C4 subjects. Comparing the average DF between the C3 subjects (Fig. 4(a)) and the C4 subjects (Fig. 4(b)) for all initial particle diameters, on average, the C4 subjects have higher DF values because of constriction in the C4 subjects. In addition, the average growth ratio decreases from about 2.0 to 1.15, with increasing initial particle size from 1 to 8 \u03bcm, which was computed for all particles that were deposited or advected to the outlet. In Fig. 4, the decrease in growth ratio was observed due to a lower surface to volume ratio, which slowed the response of particles in a humid environment. In order to test the effect of particle release time, we compared the deposition fractions for subjects with constriction. We released monodispersed particles with initial diameters ranging from 1 to 8 \u03bcm at 0.3 s. Our findings showed an increase in deposition fraction about 3.5%-5.0% compared to releasing all the particles at the initial time. The increase in deposition fraction is due to the turbulent intensity experienced by particles at a later time. Our observation suggests that releasing a fixed number of particles at each time, will likely increase the deposition for particles released closer to the peak inhalation time. The increase in deposition occurs since higher velocity leads to more inertia.",

First, the volumetric flow rate for each subject in this study is subject-specific as described above, which influences the particle-water vapor interaction time, since a larger QPI leads to a smaller growth ratio for a micron-sized particle. Second, the sensitivity of the particle growth model to physical and chemical properties of water was well studied by (Chen et al., 2017). For example, Chen et al. (2017) showed that for a small change of 50 Pa in saturated water vapor pressure, the estimated particle growth ratio was about \u223c1.45 fold larger. As shown in Fig. (3) ((c)\u2013(f)) the variation in both water vapor concentration and temperature due to evaporation would have a greater influence on the growth curve (Fig. 4) compared to predictions modeled with constant temperature and water vapor concentration, as described in Equation (9) where Ye,\u221e is computed. A more recent study by Chen et al. (2019) concluded that the impact of variable RH in generalized airways of generation 3\u20136 can impact the final particle diameter up to 18%. This highlights the importance of accurate prediction of water vapor concentration. Furthermore, the influence of lung geometry also contributes to the growth ratio, since the variations in local airway diameter throughout the airway tree, as well as local velocity, lead to a distribution of growth ratio in each generation.",

These studies are either experiments conducted in a wet wall tube or computational models that used a generalized airway geometry with constant relative humidity and temperature throughout the airways. A comparison of the average DF values shown in Fig. 4 with the study by Asgharian (2004) highlights several differences between them. In Asgharian (2004), the hygroscopic particle growth of NaCl was compared for a breathing frequency of 15 breaths per minute with a typical oral breathing tidal volume of 625 ml. The DF in the tracheobronchial region for an initial particle diameter of 2 \u03bcm was approximately 36% with a symmetric lung model compared to the current model with an average DF of 13% in the C3 subjects and 23% in the C4 subjects.

            "text": "There exist several key differences between the model presented by Asgharian (2004) and the current model. First, the current model accounts for the movement of the particle in the fluid by correcting the mass flux term in Equation (9) with Sh, whereas Asgharian (2004) excluded Sh. Second, their model assumed constant temperature and RH in the airways, which allowed particles to reach equilibrium in a short time contrary to the current model. Third, the model implemented a symmetric airway geometry, while the current airway geometries are subject-specific reconstructed from CT images. In the study by Hindle and Longest (2010), the authors performed a comparison of experimental and numerical growths of albuterol sulfate particles in an idealized airway geometry for initial particle diameters of 0.56 \u03bcm and 0.9 \u03bcm. They predicted the DF of 8.2% for 0.9 \u03bcm initial particles in a geometric lung model including the mouth-throat region. In comparison, the DF shown in Fig. 4 for an initial particle diameter of 1 \u03bcm is approximately 10% in the C3 subjects and 16% in the C4 subjects. They were in a good agreement for the C3 subjects in spite of the difference in particles, albuterol sulfate particles in Hindle and Longest (2010) vs. NaCl particles in this study.",

The initial particle diameter was fixed at 2 \u03bcm and the particle growth predicted a higher final particle diameter in the trachea region (more red particles), varying from 3.13 to 3.50 \u03bcm. This is due to the turbulent inspiratory flow that increases heat and mass transfer. Once the flow passes the carina region, the flow is split into two streams at the first bifurcation, where particles tend to travel in a circumferential manner to deposit at the bottom of the first bifurcation. Particles that are transported deeper into the lungs till the next bifurcation where more particles are deposited at the ridges (via impaction) and active particles are further split into two groups, which travel into the upper and lower airways. In the lower airways (see the boxed area in Fig. 6), DF increases with increasing initial particle diameter due to impaction. In Fig. 6 (a), the boxed region focuses on the LLL region where the airways are classified as having a non-constricted airway diameter using an imaging-based clustering algorithm. The boxed region shows that the particles deposited with final particle diameter ranging from 2.88 to 3.25 \u03bcm have more time for particle-water vapor interaction. In Fig. 6 (b), we can see an increase in particle deposition in the boxed region due to airway narrowing with the final particle diameter ranging from 2.75 to 3.13 \u03bcm.",

The impact of particle growth shown in Fig. 6 indicates that the constriction in the LLL for the C4 subjects has considerable effect in terms of particle deposition with an initial particle diameter of 2 \u03bcm. To reduce this effect in C4 subjects, the initial particle diameter required may be smaller, enabling the delivery of more particles to the alveolar region even accounting for particle growth. Previous studies have suggested that particles with an initial diameter <1.0 \u03bcm are sufficient to escape the upper airways and grow to 2.5 \u03bcm when entering the alveolar region (Worth Longest & Hindle, 2011). Based on the current study, submicron particles would reduce the DF in the LLL with constricted airways, since the final particle size would be less than 1 \u03bcm even with growth and more particles could be advected to the alveolar region. In C3 subjects with non-constricted airways, limiting the initial particle diameter to <4.0 \u03bcm, the overall DF in the airways was less than 12%. The model presented here predicts the aerodynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms of NaCl particles. In the future, the current model can be extended for particles with multi-components representing drug aerosols.",

In Table 3\n, the means of important imaging-based metrics, CFD variables, and deposition fractions in LLL for the growth model were compared between these cluster subjects using biserial correlation analysis. The analysis showed that the cluster memberships of selected C3 and C4 subjects were discriminated by Dh\u2217(sLLL) with a negative correlation of r = -0.79 (p = 0.058). Additionally, the deposition fractions in LLL, DF(LLL), were greater in C4 subjects than C3 subjects, especially for large initial particle sizes of 4 \u03bcm (r = 0.80, p = 0.056) and 8 \u03bcm (r = 0.82, p = 0.048).

Thus, this highlights the importance of using subject-specific geometry and ventilation. In a previous study, Wu et al. (2014) proposed dimensionless correlations based on local flow rate (Re), local airways diameter (Da) and trachea diameter (Dt). The proposed correlations are NuLLL=3.504(ReDaDt)0.277, which is the Nusselt number at LLL and ShLLL=3.652(ReDaDt)0.268, which is the Sherwood number at LLL, used for computing bulk heat and humidity for various breathing conditions. The above correlations are useful for understanding the role of bulk heat and humidity for hygroscopic particle growth. The correlation was calculated at peak inhalation for all subjects at LLL. The average Nu\nLLL and Sh\nLLL for C3 were 25.1 \u00b1 0.65 and 24.6 \u00b1 0.61, respectively, whereas the average Nu\nLLL and Sh\nLLL for C4 were 27.1 \u00b1 3.02 and 26.4 \u00b1 2.85, see Table 3. Overall, higher bulk heat and humidity (lower at LLL walls) were observed for C4 subjects at LLL since we employ subject-specific geometries and ventilation distribution in C4 (Re) increase, (DaDt) decrease, and in C3 (Re) decreases, (DaDt) increases. The altered local mass and heat transfer in the fluid phase are linked to the particle phase via equations (9), (13). The effect of the constriction can be seen in Fig. 6. For the C4 subjects, the local flow velocities increases in the constriction (Fig. 3), the particles entering the constriction experienced more inertia, which causes the particles to deposit at the constriction. Even though higher Nu\nLLL and Sh\nLLL are observed at the constriction (C4), the particle-water vapor interaction time is lower in the constriction, which indicates smaller deposited particle diameter (Fig. 6(b)). This effect does not occur in the C3 subjects due to the lower flow velocities at LLL. For C3 subjects, the particles entering LLL gains mass via condensation, and the final deposited particle diameters are larger, see Fig. 6(a). Thus, this highlights the importance of predicting water evaporation at the airways wall, since the mass of water transferred to the particle surface depends upon the humidity of the surrounding air. In Table 4, Pearson's correlation analysis for Nu\nLLL and Sh\nLLL with deposition fractions in LLL are shown, which indicates a strong positive correlation for deposition fraction for 1 \u03bcm case (r = 0.98, p < 0.001) and 2 \u03bcm (r = 0.96, p < 0.001). The initial particle diameter increases the correlation (Nu\nLLL and Sh\nLLL) decreases (Table 4), which is due to lower growth rates for larger particle diameters, as shown in Fig. 4. The trend is observed due to the simulation time of 1.25 s (single inhalation), where larger particles require a longer time to reach equilibrium. Airway constriction found in the C4 subjects leads to lower particle delivery to the peripheral airways, which may limit the performance of asthma inhalers.",

First, the subject-specific airway geometry was reconstructed from CT images, and the associated subject-specific inhalation capacity was computed using image registration. Furthermore, the boundary condition imposed at the terminal CT-resolved 3D airways for the 3D CFD simulation was computed based on a 1D resistance model, which could reflect the effect of local airway constriction in asthmatic subjects. Second, we employed a two-layer wall boundary condition to account for evaporation at the ASL-lumen interface. Third, we focused on investigating the hygroscopic effect in two distinct severe asthmatic subgroups, one without airway constriction and the other with constriction. It is noted that the cluster-specific structural and functional features are not detectable by clinical spirometry. These results could potentially inform the choice of particle size for inhalational drug delivery in a cluster-specific manner.",

Thus, a complete statistical analysis was not presented. The primary goal of this study was to examine the impact of particle growth in severe asthmatic cluster subjects with and without constriction in the LLL. Second, we did not consider the effect of the mouth cavity due to the lack of CT image data (Zhang, Kim, et al., 2006; Zhang, Kleinstreuer, et al., 2006). Third, a particularly interesting problem, which is not addressed in this study, is the effect of particle coagulation on DF (Asgharian et al., 2018). Finally, the initial state of the particle was assumed to be dry at the inlet. Depending on the initial particle diameter and the composition of the particle, wet particles at the inlet may shrink or grow depending on the local humidity in the airways, and the change in particle diameter will impact the particle trajectory and deposition fraction in the airways.",

            "text": "The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of hygroscopic NaCl particle deposition fraction in CT-based subject-specific airway models from imaging-based severe asthmatic clusters. The impact of hygroscopic particle growth was compared with non-growth particles by computing the total deposition fraction values in each subject. The effect of particle growth on the DF in severe asthmatic subjects with non-constricted airway diameter was overall less than in subjects with constricted airways. The effect of hygroscopic particle growth model was evaluated by taking the differences in average DF for the cases with and without growth. For C4 subjects, the hygroscopic particle growth with a fixed initial particle diameter of 2 \u03bcm contributed more to the DF, which is approximately 3.5% higher in the LLL. The higher DF in the C4 subjects is due to the local conditions such as reduced airway diameter, velocity, temperature, and available water vapor. It is important to note that the choice of using either the growth model or no-growth model is much more important for C4 subjects than C3 cluster subjects. Predicting accurate temperature and water vapor concentration in the airways is crucial for computing hygroscopic particle growth and deposition fraction, especially in severe asthmatic subjects with airway narrowing. Utilizing cluster-specific imaging-based features to group severe asthmatic subjects into clusters such as airways constriction may help tailor cluster-specific hygroscopic drug treatment for improving inhalation drug delivery. The proposed CFD lung model with hygroscopic particle growth has potential applications for studies related to exposure to tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, environmental particulate matters, and virus-laden aerosolized ambient particles, such as COVID-19.",
