The 1918\u20131919 pandemic was associated with more than 500,000 deaths in the USA and an estimated 20\u201340 million deaths worldwide, though some place the global total much higher. In an era when infectious disease mortality had been steadily decreasing, the 1918\u20131919 pandemic caused a large spike in overall population mortality, temporarily reversing decades of progress. The US Department of Health and Human Services, extrapolating from the 1918\u20131919 pandemic to the current US population size and demographics, has estimated that a comparable pandemic today would result in almost two million deaths.",

Public health measures such as reduction of close contacts with others, improved hygiene, and respiratory protection with facemasks or respirators can reduce the risk of exposure and illness (Germann et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2006), but would not reduce susceptibility among the population. Prophylaxis with antiviral medications also may prevent illness but depends on the availability of large antiviral drug stockpiles and also does not provide long-term immunity. By contrast, immunization with a well-matched pandemic vaccine would provide active immunity and represent the most durable pandemic response. However, given current timelines for the development of a pandemic influenza vaccine and its production capacity, vaccine is likely not to be available in sufficient quantities to protect the entire population before pandemic outbreaks occur, and thus potentially limited stocks may need to be prioritized. This chapter reviews information on influenza vaccine production capacity, describes approaches used in the USA to set priorities for vaccination in the setting of limited supply, and presents a proposed strategy for prioritization.",

Although some cross-protection against antigenically different influenza viruses within a subtype occurs following prior infection or vaccination, the entire population is likely to be susceptible to an influenza A virus subtype that has not circulated (or has not circulated recently) among people. Consequently, in an influenza pandemic, rates of illness are higher, severity is greater, and the distribution of mortality is more widespread compared with seasonal influenza (Simonsen et al. 1998).

Criteria for targeting in other mass vaccination campaigns have included geographic area (e.g., group A meningococcus in the African meningitis belt), exposure or proximity to a case (e.g., smallpox), age (e.g., polio), risk of infection (e.g., H. influenzae type b), risk of complications from infection (e.g., seasonal influenza), risk for transmitting infection (e.g., rubella), or (most often) a combination of these factors. Targeting has been justified as providing earliest protection to those who are most vulnerable to infection, most at risk of severe or fatal disease, or whose protection may prevent or reduce further transmission (Heymann and Aylward 2006). When vaccine supply, the capacity to administer it, or funding is limited, so that the optimal strategy\u2014rapid universal vaccination\u2014is impossible to implement, targeting mass vaccination becomes more important to achieve the best possible outcomes.",

            "text": "Until the promise of these approaches is realized, however, pandemic influenza vaccine supply is likely to be far less than pandemic response needs. For the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, most of the influenza vaccine administered in the USA was produced in other countries, and these sources of supply may not be available during a pandemic. Moreover, the amount of antigen needed to achieve a protective immune response could be substantially greater for a pandemic virus compared with seasonal influenza viruses. A clinical trial of an unadjuvanted candidate H5N1 vaccine showed that two doses containing 90 \u03bcg of hemagglutinin antigen were needed to achieve an immune response that may correlate with protection in more than half of healthy adult recipients (Treanor et al. 2006). This per dose concentration is sixfold higher than the quantities of hemagglutinin antigen included for each strain in the seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV), and twofold higher than the total hemagglutinin in a standard dose of TIV. Since two doses of the H5N1 vaccine were needed to achieve adequate immunogenicity, the quantity of antigen needed to immunize an adult would be 12-fold higher than the amount of antigen to vaccinate against a seasonal strain. Initial trials with other candidate H5N1 vaccines that contain alum, novel lipid-based adjuvants, or that use the inactivated whole virus documented immunogenicity with two doses of 30 \u03bcg, 3.8, and 10\u03bcg, respectively (Bresson et al. 2006; Leroux-Roels et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2006). While additional studies are needed, these results suggest a potentially wide range of antigen quantities needed in different vaccine formulations, which will directly impact how quickly the population can be effectively vaccinated in the event of a pandemic. Vaccine supply, therefore, would depend on the production capacity for different vaccine formulations at the time a pandemic occurs. Under some scenarios, vaccine supply would be very limited, whereas under others, assuming success in evaluating and licensing new formulations and producing them in the USA, supply may be robust.",

Using current technologies, at least 20 weeks would be required from the time the pandemic virus was identified until the first vaccine doses become available. Depending on a combination of factors, including where the pandemic begins, how quickly it is detected, the effectiveness of containment measures and the season, the first US pandemic wave may occur before any pandemic vaccine becomes available or after sufficient lead time such that vaccination is already widespread (Ferguson et al. 2005; Longini et al. 2005). In the 1957 pandemic, the first US cases occurred in June but no community outbreak occurred until August and the first pandemic wave did not peak until the end of October; by this time almost half of the approximately 60 million vaccine doses eventually produced had been delivered. By contrast, in 1968, the pandemic was not recognized until later in the year, and at the time initial US outbreaks began few persons had been vaccinated (Schwartz and Wortley 2006). Because influenza vaccine production capacity, vaccine formulation, and the time from pandemic recognition to onset of US outbreaks all are uncertain for the next pandemic, we are unable to predict how many people will be vaccinated before pandemic disease is widespread. Thus, prioritizing who is vaccinated earlier and who later will best target available supply to achieve national pandemic response goals.",

The approach to using a limited supply of pandemic vaccine may differ depending on which goals are considered most important. Results of mathematical models suggest that vaccinating school-aged children can best reduce transmission of influenza, slowing disease spread and reducing overall community attack rates (Germann et al. 2006). While studies of vaccination for seasonal influenza support a strategy of vaccinating children to protect others in the community through herd immunity (Monto et al. 1969; Piedra et al. 2005; Reichert et al. 2001), uncertainty in the amount of vaccine that will be available or its timeliness make reliance on trying to induce indirect protection a risky strategy. Hospitalizations and deaths from pandemic illness can be reduced by directly vaccinating those at highest risk for these severe outcomes. Based on age-specific mortality rates in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, vaccinating persons \u226565 years old would have prevented substantially more deaths compared with vaccinating other age groups, despite the lower vaccine efficacy among the elderly (in 1918 this would not have been the case because of the high mortality rate among young adults).",

A survey of county health department workers in Maryland found that 46% of respondents indicated they would not report to work in a pandemic. In a multivariable analysis, confidence in one\u2019s personal safety was significantly associated with a willingness to work (Balicer et al. 2006). Whether response to a survey is predictive of actual behavior is unclear; anecdotally, virtually all healthcare workers in Toronto reported to work during the SARS outbreak, despite the fear associated with a new disease and the spread that occurred within hospitals.

The report identifies significant interdependency between sectors, expresses concern about the maintenance of supply chains, many of which stretch overseas, and emphasizes the importance and challenges of implementing a targeted vaccination program. Of the approximately 85 million workers in these sectors, 16.9 million were defined by NIAC as essential in a pandemic. About nine million of these workers are in the healthcare and emergency services (emergency medical services, law enforcement, and fire protection) sectors. In other sectors, the proportion of the workforce defined as critical ranges from almost 50% in the nuclear sector to less than 5% of the food and agriculture sector.

Groups that were prioritized for earliest vaccination included healthcare workers, manufacturers of pandemic vaccine and antiviral drugs, and persons at high risk of severe illness and death. Personnel in critical infrastructure sectors other than healthcare were prioritized after these groups, which include over 100 million persons.

Factors contributing to the decision to reassess the recommendations included a shift in national pandemic planning assumptions to a more severe pandemic scenario extrapolated from the 1918 pandemic (Table 1); recognition that the HHS guidance did not include groups that could be considered for prioritization such as border protection personnel or the military; a broader understanding of the risk to essential services stimulated by the NIAC report; and a series of public engagement meetings convened by the CDC, where participants identified protecting essential community services as the most important goal for pandemic vaccination rather than protecting those who are at highest risk (Public Engagement Pilot Project on Pandemic Influenza 2005). The federal working group process included consideration of the scientific issues reviewed in the earlier prioritization process, assessment of mathematical modeling results, and discussion with public health officials, critical infrastructure providers and homeland and national security experts. Recognizing that science alone cannot define the best approach to pandemic vaccine prioritization, key elements of the process were consideration of ethical issues, input from the public and stakeholders, and a formal decision analysis.\n",

A strategy of targeting pandemic influenza vaccination to reduce health, societal and economic impacts was considered ethically appropriate. Although a strict utilitarian principle could not be applied because of uncertainty about what strategy would provide the most benefit, targeting protection of society in a broad sense was given higher priority than protecting individuals at high risk of complications from influenza. Fairness and equity are important principles where everyone is recognized to have equal value, and all persons within a targeted group should have similar access to vaccination. Reciprocity, which posits that protection should be afforded to those who assume increased risk in an occupation that benefits society, also was considered important, and a reasonable corollary to healthcare providers\u2019 \u201cduty of care\u201d where one is committed to provide care even in settings that increase personal risk.

Each meeting included initial presentations to educate participants on influenza and influenza vaccine, pandemics, and the rationale for vaccine prioritization. Participants discussed potential objectives of pandemic vaccination in small groups and then met in a plenary session where the objectives were discussed further. Finally, participants rated the importance of each of ten proposed objectives using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cextremely important\u201d (a score of 7) to \u201cnot important\u201d (a score of 1).

The degree to which each group met each of the ten vaccination program objectives was then assessed and scored: how well each group met objectives related to occupational role or exposure was scored by representatives on the federal working group; for objectives where clinical trial or epidemiological data can be used to assess how well a group met an objective, scoring was done by influenza experts from CDC and academic medical centers. The score assigned to each group for each objective was then weighted by the average rating of the objective\u2019s importance from the public engagement and stakeholders meetings (Table 2).

By contrast, general population groups received no score for the occupationally-related objectives. To control for this difference, we stratified potential vaccination target groups into four categories: those that provide healthcare and community support services; those that provide critical infrastructure services; those that protect homeland and national security; and the general population. Within these categories, target groups were clustered based on their scores, with breakpoints between clusters defined by difference between scores. Groups scoring highest among each of these categories are shown in Table 3.\n",

Reflecting the similar value placed by the public on protecting persons who provide pandemic healthcare, who maintain essential community services or are at high occupational risk, and protecting children, each of the highest vaccination tiers for a severe pandemic includes groups from each category (Table 4). Generally, the specific groups included in each tier track closely with the results of the decision analysis. Some groups, such as deployed military forces and those who provide support for their mission, are placed in a higher tier in recognition that they may be affected in a pandemic earlier than persons in the USA due to their geographical locations, their increased risk because of crowded living conditions, and the impact of illness on their ability to function effectively. In some critical infrastructure sectors, target groups are prioritized in a lower tier because their expected occupational burden would likely decrease in a pandemic (e.g., passenger transportation), they can largely be protected by changes in work practices such as teleworking, and/or the workforce or work is \u201cfungible;\u201d that is, the impact of absenteeism or reduced function can be mitigated by the redundancy within the sector (e.g., trucking, food processing).\n",

Healthcare, for example, relies on the sectors that provide electricity, clean water, communications, information technology, transportation, pharmaceuticals, food, and chemicals. In a less severe pandemic, however, historical experience suggests that these services are unlikely to be substantially affected. In both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, essential services were maintained without targeting pandemic vaccination. Therefore, the US strategy differs for severe, moderate, and less severe pandemics, with some of the occupational groups not targeted in moderate and less severe pandemics, and those workers being vaccinated with their age and health status group in the general population category. Pandemic severity is classified using the Pandemic Severity Index, which defines five categories based on the case fatality rate of pandemic illness (CDC 2007). A Category 1 pandemic, defined by a case fatality rate of <0.1%, would result in a mortality only slightly greater than a severe seasonal influenza epidemic, and the proposed US vaccine prioritization guidance for less severe pandemics (Categories 1 and 2) is formulated to be more similar to recommendations for annual influenza vaccination.",

This may reflect national planning assumptions for a less severe pandemic, lower predicted rates of worker absenteeism, and a belief that infrastructures can be protected by planning to protect workers using nonpharmaceutical interventions and antiviral medications to treat or prevent illness. Some countries, such as Canada or Australia, which have substantial domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity and small populations, may choose not to prioritize vaccination because of the ability to vaccinate everyone over several months.

Key implementation issues include the method of identifying persons who are in target groups, validation at the vaccination site, vaccine administration and tracking, and monitoring for the occurrence of adverse events. A major problem could be having to turn away persons who are panicked about the severity of a pandemic yet do not meet the criteria for vaccination at that time under the prioritization strategy. Currently, no comparable program exists and each step will need to be planned and tested in preparedness exercises. Effective communications also will be important. While substantial public involvement in the development of the vaccine prioritization strategy increases the chance that the approach will be acceptable to the public, communications goals will be to assure the public that the entire population will have the opportunity to be vaccinated, to communicate the rationale for prioritization and the prioritization strategy, and to inform people when it is their turn to be vaccinated.",

Nevertheless, the optimal solution is to pursue preparedness activities that will obviate the need to prioritize. Ongoing programs to increase influenza vaccine production capacity, to stretch vaccine supply through the use of new adjuvants, and to develop influenza vaccines targeted at antigens that are conserved across the different influenza A subtypes may all lead to a time when pandemic influenza vaccine prioritization will be unnecessary.",
