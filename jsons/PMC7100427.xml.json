Outside China, there are now 10,566 cases in 72 countries and 166 deaths. Of the deaths reported so far, most of them have been elderly men [1\u20134]. Adults are more likely to be infected with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) than children; and symptoms are relatively milder in pediatric patients than in adult patients. The same conditions occurred during the SARS and MERS outbreaks. It is still not clear why children seem to be escaping the worst effects of the coronavirus infection [5\u20137].",

In addition, whether the virus will exist for a long time remains to be verified.

            "text": "The treatment guidelines are very cautious about recommending antiviral drugs for children. Almost all guidelines highlight that there are no effective antiviral drugs for children at present. The Interim Guidance for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 infection (the Sixth version) issued by the National Health Commission of China is only available for adults in the field of antiviral treatments. The recommended antiviral drugs are interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine diphosphate and arbidol [2] which have been used in the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. Based on the available evidences, IFN-\u03b1 nebulization can be used in children, and it has shown good safety profiles under most circumstances. However, children are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of chloroquine phosphate in the body, which could possibly induce severe retinopathy, ototoxicity and cardiotoxicity. On the other hand, it lacks data on the safety of using lopinavir/ritonavir and abidor for children under 2 years of age. In the absence of adequate evidence for efficacy and safety, experts have not reached on an agreement on using ribavirin in the pediatric population. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children (Second Edition) recommend the use of IFN-\u03b1, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin in children, without specifying age limitation [10]. The recommended dosage of ribavirin infusion varies in different medical literatures. Some suggest intravenous infusion of ribavirin administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every time (maximum 500 mg every time), 2\u20133 times daily [10], whereas others recommend 10\u201315 mg/kg per day, divided into 2\u20133 times daily [11].",
