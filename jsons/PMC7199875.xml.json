Since there are no data existing on the international architecture of NSI research available, the present study used the NewQIS project platform (Groneberg-Kloft et al. 2009a) to construct the first picture of global NSI research strategies. We aimed to (1) perform an in-depth analysis of the global NSI research activities and to (2) visualize a variety of figures related to NSI research by the use of density-equalizing procedures proposed by Gastner and Newman (Gastner and Newman 2004).",

As stated before, they generate a large amount of indirect, direct, potential, and intangible costs, which possibly increase over time (Mannocci et al. 2016). Despite this enormous burden of disease, no concise visualization of the global research efforts has been established so far. Why? Probably, because NSIs are not just a single entity such as a disease or a pathogen, but an accident, resulting from a series of failures, which can be analyzed from different perspectives: determinants, characteristics, distribution, consequences, prevention of accidents, and prevention of consequences. Therefore, the present results need to be interpreted with caution. Our approach aimed to visualize global research activities in the field of NSI and related areas of science. To approach this aim, metadata were used from the Web of Science between 1900 and 2014 and 2,987 publications were identified which were specifically related to NSI. Interestingly, almost all NSI-related articles (99.2%) were published between the years 1975 and 2014, indicating only a very minimal activity in the decades before. The reason for this increase after 1975 is based upon two findings: observations that (a) hepatitis B (first articles appearing in 1975\u201380), and then (b) HIV (first documented case in literature in 1984) could be acquired through a needlestick. One might argue that due to the minimal activities more than three decades ago, the analysis should have been limited to, i.e., the past decades. However, including a time span from 1900 to 1975 directly illustrates the lack of global NSI activities. This information might be useful for a placement on the historical continuum of medical sciences.",

Furthermore, the USA possesses the most national and international collaborations among all nations. How can these data be interpreted? First of all, it is important to discuss these results with regard to the overall global research performance and general trends. To achieve this, the presently observed increase in NSI research activities needs to be related to the increase in global research activities, in specific, biomedical research activities. It is wrong to take the growth of databases such as the presently used Web of Science as a precise tool for increase in research activities (since no existing database captures everything) (Noorden 2014). However, it may serve as a proxy (Bornmann and Mutz 2014). By analyzing more than 755 million cited references in 38 million publications from 1980 to 2012, Bornmann and Mutz estimated the growth of research for 2012 between 8 to 9% (Bornmann and Mutz 2014). Although only restricted to WoS data, our analysis shows for NSI a growth rate which is not constantly increasing, but varying between years, especially in the 1990s to the 2000s. This is an uncommon picture, because usually the growth is more or less linear, as previously demonstrated (Noorden 2014; Bornmann and Mutz 2014).",

In our sub-analysis, South Africa was detected to belong to the top ten most active countries concerning HIV-specific NSI research. Other countries, such as Japan, with a significant prevalence of HCV in the general population, observed cases of hepatitis C linked to NSIs after the identification of a specific antibody test to detect seroconversion in the early 1990s, and this is why papers appear in gastroenterology and hepatology journals. This is visualized by our NSI research area analysis in which Japan is very prominent in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology. Also, in our sub-analysis, Japan appeared in the top ten activity ranking of specific NSI-hepatitis research.",
