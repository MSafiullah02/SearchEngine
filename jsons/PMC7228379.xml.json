Indeed, many of the recent respiratory outbreaks are linked with zoonotic viruses as SARS\u2010CoV,17 avian influenza A virus H5N1,18 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1,19 and more recently MERS\u2010CoV,20 with the majority being first reported in Asia. Collectively, active surveillance for (novel) zoonotic viruses in this vulnerable part of the world is of both medical and public health significance. As such, for the detection of novel zoonotic viruses in humans and animals, during 2012\u20102015 the Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic InfectiONS (VIZIONS) project, consisting of the various hospital\u2010 and community\u2010based studies, was conducted across Vietnam.21, 22 Herein, we focus our analysis on a community\u2010based study, which was designed to capture the cross\u2010species transmission events of zoonotic viruses among individuals with a high risk of zoonotic infections in southern and highland Vietnam. In this study, our aim was to describe the frequency of common respiratory viruses in clinical samples collected from these individuals, later called cohort members, at baseline and when a respiratory disease episode was reported during the study period.",

More specifically, our analysis shows that EVs and influenza A virus were more often found in the rainy season (from May to October), and there were fluctuations in the detection of EVs and HRV over time, while influenza A virus activity was relatively stable over the study period, suggesting that these viruses may have interacted with the immune landscape of the study population.",
