            "text": "Surgical site infections (SSIs) are infections of the incision or organ space that occur after surgery. 1, 2 SSIs are reported in approximately 2%\u22123% of surgical procedures and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. [1] [2] [3] The cost of treating SSIs in the United States is increasing. 1 Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) estimates an average cost of $27,000 per SSI, with a range of $11,778 to $42,177. [4] [5] [6] The cost can exceed $90,000 per SSI when an antimicrobial-resistant organism is involved. 1 Annually, the estimated cost to the U.S. health system is between 15.8 and 57.2 billion dollars. 2 It is often difficult to determine the cost of an individual SSI, and this is true at Children's Hospital & Medical Center because direct cost accounting is not used. Approximately 40% to 60% of SSIs are preventable. 7 Correctly administered perioperative prophylactic antibiotics decrease the rate of SSIs. 1, 2 Clinical practice guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis published in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy recommend intraoperative antibiotic dosing intervals during surgical procedures based on the pharmacokinetics of each drug. 2, 8 In the cardiac surgical patient population, correct intraoperative antibiotic redosing has decreased SSI rates. 3 At the Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the SSI rate was higher than the Abstract Introduction: At Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the intraoperative antibiotic redosing guidelines and the time frame considered compliant for redosing were unclear. This lack of clarity plus an ill-defined process for ensuring intraoperative antibiotic redosing resulted in a compliance rate of 11%. The organization's surgical site infection (SSI) rate was 3.19%, above the national benchmark of 1.87%. The primary project goal was to increase intraoperative antibiotic redosing compliance. The secondary project goal was to decrease SSIs. Methods: With recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America, we developed new organizational redosing guidelines, as well as a new antibiotic-specific reminder alert in the electronic medical record. Implementation of the new guidelines and processes occurred after providing education to the anesthesiologists, surgeons, and circulating nurses. Monthly evaluation of data allowed for quick recognition of oversights followed by the initiation of process updates. Results: Data showed that the initial compliance rate for the intraoperative redosing of antibiotics was 11%. Following interventions, compliance has reached and sustained an average of 99%. Survey results show that provider knowledge of the guidelines and process has improved. Though not directly related, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program observed that the SSI rate decreased from 3.19% in 2014 to 2.3% in 2018. Conclusions: This project demonstrates that comprehensive education along with antibiotic-specific electronic medical record alerts significantly increased the compliance of intraoperative antibiotic redosing at Children's Hospital & Medical Center. Continuous education and monthly updates sustained results for over 40 months.

NSQIP uses a systematic sampling process to ensure a representative sample of surgical cases. It excludes cardiac, ophthalmology, interventional radiology, dental procedures, and endoscopies. The hospital contributes to the NSQIP database entering 13% of cases annually. In 2014, Children's SSI rate for all cases was 3.19%, whereas the benchmark was 1.88%. The NSQIP database identified 42 SSIs. Therefore, based on the hospital's total surgical volume, approximately 315 SSIs occurred in 2014.",

Additionally, a well-defined process for ordering intraoperative antibiotics was necessary. QI projects are exempt from institutional review board application and approval. This project utilized the Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) methodology (Table 2) , thorough data analysis, and on-going education. 10 Our project team consisted of 2 anesthesiologists, a surgeon, an operating room (OR) nurse, a pharmacist, and an information technology (IT) specialist. In May 2015, we gathered baseline data. Concurrently, monthly meetings were held with the SSI workgroup to review current processes. The SSI workgroup consisted of a surgeon from each subspecialty, a pharmacist from the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program, members from the Performance Improvement Department, an IT specialist, OR nursing managers, and 2 anesthesiologists. At these meetings, research into existing intraoperative antibiotic redosing guidelines and policies took place. Most committee members, including the anesthesiologists, surgeons, and OR nurses, were unaware of formal antibiotic redosing guidelines. However, we discovered that hospital guidelines did exist via a paper ordering sheet. In June 2015, members of the project team worked with members of the hospital's Antimicrobial Stewardship Program to establish perioperative antimicrobial guidelines utilizing information from the Infectious Disease Society of America and information compiled from hospitals that are part of the Children's Hospital Association Network (Table 3) . 8, 11, 12 This work outlined procedures and drug-specific timeframes for intraoperative antibiotic redosing. To be deemed compliant with the redosing, antibiotics needed to be administered 30 minutes before or after the electronic medical record (EMR) redosing due time, determined by the antibiotic administration start time. If a procedure was longer than 2 half-lives, the drug was to be readministered. Renal function did not play a specific role in the creation of the guidelines; however, the pharmacy looks at the creatinine clearance if available on each patient before fulfilling a requested redose.",

The process for ordering the antibiotics consisted of the OR circulating nurse calling the pharmacy to request a redose. All education was provided before the project go-live date of August 10, 2015. Newly hired anesthesiologists received the information regarding the guidelines and processes in their orientation.",

            "text": "Following the project initiation, monthly evaluation of EMR data occurred. The Performance Improvement Department conducted an initial data review with potential cases of noncompliance sent to the anesthesiologists on the project team. The review of these noncompliant cases involved peer-to-peer conversations and revisions in the process followed by further education if required ( Table 2 ). Anesthesiologists often notated in the record as to why the antibiotic redose was late or missed. This notation was crucial as sometimes the peer-to-peer conversations would take place 3 weeks after surgery, making recall difficult. By analyzing noncompliance, we identified oversights in the process, recurring issues with providers, and issues at specific locations or times of day (Table 2) . Anesthesia providers received monthly updates on compliance rates. In October 2015, the anesthesia resident involved in a missed antibiotic redose was unaware of the hospital's new guidelines and thought the EMR alert was incorrect and therefore ignored it. Education sessions or emails about the process and guidelines *Initial preoperative dose should occur within 60 min of incision for all antibiotics, except vancomycin and fluoroquinolones which should be given within 120 min of incision. \u2020Redosing: Time should be measured from the start of administration of the preoperative dose not from the beginning of the procedure; occurs if the duration of the procedure exceeds 2 drug half-lives or excessive blood loss; and if patient has moderate to severe renal dysfunction contact pharmacy for dosing assistance. \u2021Severe penicillin allergy: IgE-mediated reaction (eg, anaphylaxis, urticaria, bronchospasm) or exfoliative dermatitis (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis),or a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction. \u00a7Initial preoperative dose should occur within 60 min of incision for all antibiotics, except vancomycin and fluoroquinolones which should be given within 120 min of incision. Time should be measured from the start of administration of the preoperative dose not from the beginning of the procedure. \u00b6Antimicrobial Stewardship Program committee approval excluded anesthesia residents as identified by the missed antibiotic dose. Anesthesia residents rotate through the ORs monthly and play an important role in direct patient care. To address this oversight, we included the Perioperative Antimicrobial Guidelines and education on the EMR alerts in the resident orientation. This oversight also highlighted the problem that redosing was strictly reliant on the anesthesia team. Therefore, the time-out process was updated to include a discussion on antibiotic redosing. The circulating nurse writes the redosing time on the surgical whiteboard for all members of the OR team to see, adding a layer of protection in the process. In November 2015, a provider recognized that the new guidelines did not address redosing in neonates. Team leaders discussed this with the team pharmacist, who created separate neonatal guidelines for those less than 28 days of age with normal renal function. In November 2016, during data analysis and with input from anesthesiologists, it was determined that misses or near misses were occurring off hours (after 5 pm and on the weekends) and in non-OR locations (such as the fetal care center). To account for this, we updated the EMR antibiotic reminder to alert 30 minutes before the time due, allowing staff more time to order and physically receive the antibiotics. Project leaders discussed these obstacles at group meetings and encouraged anesthesia providers to order the antibiotics early in these circumstances. The pharmacy representative on the team was also made aware of this problem to provide education to the pharmacy staff. Providers received updates when new PDCA cycles or updates in the process occurred.",

Our compliance rates increased the first month significantly (Fig. 1) and have remained high for over 41 months, averaging 99.2%. We believe that our compliance rates rose so significantly because our institution's previous guidelines were unclear and that our compliance rates are higher than those reported by other institutions because of the multilayered approach of our study.

Per hospital policy, physicians order all antibiotics from the pharmacy to ensure administration of the correct dose, which can take additional time. And, as with any QI project, communication is imperative. Some providers remained unaware of the changes implemented with this project. The education initially excluded residents and new providers, as we identified with monthly audits. An additional limitation is that OR nurses do not always write the antibiotic redosing time on the whiteboard despite this being part of the time-out process. We have not initiated any PDCA cycles to improve this, but it is something we could consider in the future.
