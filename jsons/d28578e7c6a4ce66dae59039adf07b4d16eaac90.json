It should be remembered that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a group of infl ammatory diseases of the nasal cavities that may or may not include polyp formation with no unifying theory based on scientifi c evidence that will explain the pathophysiology of chronic airway disease in all cases. In contrast, the etiology appears to be multifactorial. Research has focused on alterations involving infl ammatory cell and T-cell stimulation, the role of TGF-\u03b2 on remodeling, generation of infl ammatory mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, the role of IgE and microorganisms, and also the role of the epithelium as an immunologic barrier to infection or insult. While much of the more recent literature appears to focus primarily on CRS as an infl ammatory disease, that is not to say that bacteria and microorganisms are not involved in some cases and that antibiotics will not be helpful in alleviating some symptoms [ 21 ] . Bacteria have been shown to play a role in some patients with CRS either directly by infection or by stimulation of infection [ 22 ] . The main bacteria implicated in causing infection or triggering infl ammation in patients with CRS, especially those with nasal polyps and asthma, is Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) [ 22 ] . In a recent study, swabs from the middle meatus of controls and patients with CRS were taken during endoscopic surgery and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There was no statistically signifi cant difference in the total bacteria seen between CRS patients and the controls, but the abundance of S. aureus was increased in CRS patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and asthma [ 22 ] . Nevertheless, the antibiotic approach to a CRS patient experiencing an acute fl are of rhinosinusitis should include a drug choice directed against the same organisms defi ned above.
