            "text": "Another more recently approved drug that has been explored in rabies infection is favipiravir (T-705), a broad spectrum antiviral [5]. Intracellular host enzymes convert favipiravir to its active form favipiravir-4-ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate (T-705-RTP). The mechanism of action of T-705-RTP remains a topic of discussion. It mimics a purine nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or causes lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the viral RNA [6]. Favipiravir is currently approved for treatment against influenza in Japan, and is in clinical development the United States [5]. Recently Yamada et al. [7] showed that favipiravir also has antiviral activity against Rabies virus. In vivo experiments showed that it, under conditions of early start of treatment, improves the clinical signs and survival rate of mice infected intramuscularly. If the start of favipiravir treatment is delayed for 1 or 2 days no significant protective effect can be observed. This indicates that favipiravir might be ineffective against viruses located within the nervous systems and may be only effective before neuroinvasion.",

Biochemical studies revealed that ALS-008112-5\u2032-triphosphate is a potent and selective inhibitor of RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (K\ni of 0.09 \u00b5M), via a classic chain termination mechanism. In vitro experiments also show that ALS-008112 is active on Parainfluenza virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The EC50 on VSV was reported as 3.4 \u00b5M, which is \u223c20-fold less active as on RSV but still with a good selectivity (CC50 > 100 \u00b5M). No activity was detected on negative strand RNA viruses beyond the Paramyxo- and Rhabdoviridae families, nor was activity noted against any of the tested positive strand RNA viruses [8]. As indicated above ALS-008176 is a prodrug that needs metabolisation to become active. In particular, the phosphorylation to the nucleoside-triphosphate is a step that can be cell type dependent and that should be explored in neurons in the case of rabies.",

The rabies RNP is built around the N-protein that oligomerizes to form a helix around which the viral RNA is wrapped. This RNP is the template for transcription and replication by the RdRp (L protein). Viral RNA synthesis is mediated by the viral Phospho- (P) protein, which is a multifunctional protein that interacts with L and N. The P-protein allows efficient and specific recognition of the RNP template by the RdRp and subsequent RNA polymerization. In this way, P permits the continued contact between the RdRp and the RNP as the RdRp progresses.",
