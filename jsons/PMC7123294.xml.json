We start with simple Linux commands and the WebLab bioinformatics platform developed by CBI, to get familiar with dozens of bioinformatics tools through hands-on practice. We will do a lot of exercises for sequence alignment, database similarity search, motif finding, gene prediction, as well as phylogenetic tree construction and molecular modeling. Finally, we will focus on several projects to solve real biological problems. You are also encouraged to bring your own problems to discuss and, hopefully, to solve during the course!",

Interestingly, a close relative of bar-headed goose, the graylag goose, lives in the low land of India all year round and do not migrate. Sequence alignment of bar-headed goose hemoglobin with that of graylag goose shows that there are only 4 substitutions. The Pro 119 in the alpha subunit of graylag goose has been changed to Ala in bar-headed goose. This residue is located in the surface of the alpha/beta interface. In 1983, Perutz proposed that this substitution reduces the contact between the alpha and beta subunits and increases the oxygen affinity, due to the relation of the tension status in the deoxy form [1].",
