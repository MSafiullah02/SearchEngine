In the online survey, participants were asked whether they received COVID-19-related information frequently from the following sources: the Internet (including blogs, Internet news, and social media, such as Facebook, Line, Twitter, and Plurk), friends, traditional media (including television, newspapers, and radio broadcasting), formal lessons on COVID-19 (whether online or in-person), medical staff in health care settings, coworkers, and family members.

The mean score for psychological well-being were 3.3 (SD = 0.9). The major source of information on COVID-19 was the Internet (80.6%), followed by traditional media (53.5%). The associations of each information source with psychological well-being were examined using multiple regression analyses to control for sex, age, education and worry about COVID-19. We found that for non-health-care workers, receiving COVID-19 information from the Internet and from medical staff was negatively and positively related with psychological well-being, respectively; both relationships were significant. For health care workers, receiving COVID-19 information from formal lessons was significantly positively related with psychological well-being.",

Because its recipients are unlikely to be able to adjudicate truth from falsity, misinformation results in confusion and anxiety. Furthermore, poor mental health may limit some from searching for information from a variety of sources, and they may obsessively search for COVID-19 information to alleviate their anxiety.

A study in China reported depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress in a high proportion of health care workers who were ever exposed to information on COVID-19 (Lai et al., 2020) . It was the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, in addition to physical and psychological exhaustion, that resulted in such mental health problems (Neto et al., 2020) . Thus, our study and previous studies have demonstrated the necessity of providing timely and transparent formal lessons on COVID-19 for health care workers.",

People, especially older adults, may receive COVID-19 information from the physicians on their regular or emergent visits for their existing chronic illnesses. Research demonstrated that COVID-19 affects older adults more as well as people with comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic kidney disease (Shahid et al., 2020) . These groups of people have a greater need for health information. Thus, we suggested that all medical staff, not only frontline staff, must have complete and accurate information on COVID-19 to educate the public; the Internet and television are practical vehicles for public health education during this pandemic.
