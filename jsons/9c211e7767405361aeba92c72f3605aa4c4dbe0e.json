According to the 6 selected risk factors (namely population density, disposable income of urban residents, the number of medical and health institutions, the number of hospital beds, average annual temperature and average annual relative humidity) significantly related to HFMD morbidity, the prediction performance of Classical Linear Regression Model(CLRM) and Spatial Lag Model(SLM) has been compared. The results showed that SLM achieved better effect and R square reached 0.82. It was showed that spatial effect played the crucial role in the HFMD morbidity prediction and its contribution attained 88%. However, CLRM showed low prediction accuracy and bias estimation. It was demonstrated that including spatial effect item into CLRM could greatly improve the performance of HFMD morbidity prediciton model.",

Adults HFMD cases unusually appreared, but they could take and transmit the virus. HFMD occurred in China in 1981 and became prevalence in most of the provinces all over the country. Recently, the scale of HFMD outbreak has gradually increased and greatly threatened the health security of the nation. In 2008, the administration of HFMD was strengthened further [1] .",

Although some scholars investigated the factors that could cause HFMD prevalence from the view of physical, social, economic and humanity, the epidemiology analysis was carried out mostly based on classical statistics. At the end of 1960s, spatial correlation was firstly used in the research on pathogeny analysis [6] . In 1973, Cliff and Ord [7] put forward the concept and framework of spatial autocorrelation. Since then, a series of exploration and study on the theory and methodology about spatial data analysis has come forth [8] [9] [10] . Over the recent years, the technology of Geographical Information System(GIS) in which spatial analysis is the key point has developed very rapidly and been increasingly used in the field of public health [11] [12] [13] [14] .",
