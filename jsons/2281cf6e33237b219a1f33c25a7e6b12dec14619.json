Most measures of health inequality were developed in order to analyze differences in health status for such socioeconomic subgroups in national populations. The first group of measures, extended to include age, is described in the present chapter, and the second group of measures is described in Chap. 7. It is important to distinguish between measures of inequality in the distribution of a health measure, such as among ages, geographic areas, and general population groups, and measures of the differences in a health measure among various socioeconomic groups in a population for the purpose of determining the degree of causation between them. The latter may involve not only different measures but also causal inferences, value judgments, and differences in interpretation. While most recent research has focused on variations in the health status of socioeconomic groups within countries, in the discussion that follows in this chapter, I focus mainly on variations in health status among countries and among general populations. As is usual in demographic or epidemiological analysis, the conclusions drawn about variations and trends in health inequality among populations may differ depending on the measure used.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The reader is familiar with the summary measures of central tendency and dispersion that are used for analyzing the mortality and health characteristics of countries and comparing a group of countries with regard to these characteristics.

As noted earlier, the relative interquartile range and the coefficient of variation may be used to evaluate the differences in the shapes of the different distributions.

Distributions can be \"scaled\" for comparison of their patterns by dividing or multiplying the elements in each distribution by a representative constant derived from the same distribution, such as its sum, mean, or median. After such scaling, the total, mean, or median of each distribution is reduced to a value of one. The same parameter, i.e., total, mean, or median, must be used for each distribution being compared. An alternative method is to multiply the elements of each distribution by the ratio of the mean or median of one of the distributions (\"the standard distribution\") to the mean or median of each of the other distributions. In effect, the \"standard\" distribution is left unchanged. Now all the distributions being compared have the \"same\" general level, scaled to the mean or median of the standard distribution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measures That Describe Individual Populations"}, {"text": "Scaling is most appropriately applied in comparisons of age distributions of different species, where the lengths of life of the species being compared are often sharply different, e.g., deaths of humans and deaths of mice.

In this and earlier chapters I describe many summary measures of the health status of population groups, e.g., the percents in categories of self-reported health, mean age at death, age-adjusted death rate, disease prevalence ratio, and life expectancy. In comparing such measures for two or more population groups, there are several choices. First, one can take the absolute difference between the measures. For this purpose one group must be selected as a standard or basis of comparison. One can select as the standard the value for the \"leading\" or \"best\" group (e.g., age-adjusted death rate in State A), to be compared with the value for the lagging group (e.g., age-adjusted death rate in State B). The absolute difference between the leading value and the lagging value provides an indication of the distance the lagging group has to go in order to close the gap between the two groups. Alternatively, the leading value may be a future target value (e.g., life expectancy in 2015) and the other value may be the figure for the current date (e.g., life expectancy in 2005). The absolute difference between the target value and the current value provides an indication of the progress required to reach the target.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measures That Describe Individual Populations"}, {"text": "Often the choice of the target level or the leading group is arbitrary. The classification system used for the groups being compared (e.g., races) affects the choice of the leading group. For example, the amount of progress in reducing the differences between the age-adjusted death rates of the races would vary by the degree of disaggregation of the races (e.g., Asian-Americans as a group vs. Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, etc.). With the passage of time, the levels achieved by the various groups may change, the identity of the leading group may change, and the form of the computation may have to be changed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measures That Describe Individual Populations"}, {"text": "Differences between groups can also be measured in relative terms (although some analysts object to taking ratios of rates in this way).

The result would be negative, however, if the current value moves away from the target. Because of the often small size of the changes, the progress quotient may change irregularly from year to year, and if the target value is only slightly greater than the baseline value, the instability in the measure gives the results an uncertain meaning. The current value may already have exceeded the target value, and in this case the result would exceed 100%. Absolute and relative measures of differences may lead to different conclusions about changes over time. That is, equal relative progress for different groups does not correspond to equal absolute progress for them. The absolute difference between two groups in some health measure may decline while the relative difference may increase, depending on how the denominator is selected (as in the example below). In the calculation of the relative measure, the base chosen for calculating the percent difference at some date is usually the value for the group taken as the standard but this does not have to be the case. It may be better to use a more neutral and a more stable figure in the denominator, such as the value for all groups combined that are being compared.

The two halves of the century can be distinguished by their very different gains in life expectancy. Major shifts also occurred in the age incidence and the causal pattern of mortality rates between the first half and the second half of the century. Prevention and control of infectious diseases explain much of the increase in life expectancy at birth in the first half of the century, and reductions in the chronic diseases of later life explain much of the increase in the second half of the century.

The greater access to health care, medical advances, and adoption of a healthier lifestyle (e.g., reduced smoking) mainly account for the reductions in death rates during the second half of the century (Fried 2000) . An element in this general reduction is the greater survival of people to age 65 in a condition of better health. As a result of the timing and types of socioeconomic and medical developments during the last century, the distribution of the gain in life expectancy over the century at age 65 was quite different from the distribution of the gain in life expectancy at birth. While life expectancy at birth increased sharply early in the century, life expectancy at age 65 improved mainly after 1950 (Table 6 .3; Fig. 6 .3). Life expectancy at age 65 increased by 4.1 years during the second half of the twentieth century and only 1.9 years during the first half of the century. These absolute gains seem modest, but the increase of life expectancy at age 65 in relative terms over the whole century (51 percent) was almost as great as the relative increase in life expectancy at birth (56%). Table 6 .4 also illustrates this trend with data on changes in survival ratios and age-bounded life expectancies (i.e., average years lived in an age interval). The average years lived in the interval from age 65 to age 80 increased from 11.1 years to 12.5 years (out of a total of 15 possible years), that is, by 1.4 years, in the half century from 1950 to 2000, whereas in the previous half century the increase in average years lived in this interval amounted to only 1.0 year. In the birth-to-65year interval, the comparable shifts were in the opposite direction, from 14.3 years in the earlier period to 3.5 years in the later period. The reductions in death rates and the increases in survival ratios at the older ages (ages 65-80) have also increased greatly in relation to the corresponding changes for the younger age groups (ages under 65).

First, at a time when the general level of mortality was far higher than it is today, infectious diseases headed the list of causes while today the list is headed by the chronic diseases of later life. Second, both then and now several chronic diseases, particularly heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and cancer, are in the top ten. Because most of the leading causes of death are endogenous causes now, these same causes figure among the top 10 causes at ages 65 years and over currently The combination of heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, the main cardiovascular diseases, accounts for over one-third of all of the deaths currently. This is true even though there has been a tremendous decrease -about 31% -in the death rate from this group of causes between 1970 and 2004 (U.S. NCHS 2007a). The reduction in the death rates from these and some other major chronic diseases of later life in the United States in this period was spectacularly large, unanticipated, and unprecedented. Mainly for this reason, overall mortality at the older ages declined by over one-third between 1970 and 2004. On the other hand, the pace of the decline of the major cardiovascular diseases has been slowing during these decades. The rate of decline in the death rate from these causes was 15% in the 1970s, 13% in the 1980s, and 8% in the 1990s. During the same 34-year period the death rates for several other leading diseases have been increasing or changing little. The (age-adjusted) death rate from cancer has shown zero net change in this period, first increasing in the 1970s and 1980s and then decreasing in the 1990s ( Fig. 6 .5).

For example, if a hypothetical distribution of deaths by cause was obtained as the product of the middle series of projections of population for 2050 published by the U.S. Census Bureau and recent recorded age-sex-cause-specific death rates, all causes except heart disease, the other cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes would lose ground, relative to these three causes, between 2000 and 2050 (Sonnenschein and Brody 2005) .

Some of the research emphasizes the rise in socioeconomic status of the members of a cohort and the improvements in public health and medical knowledge as the members of the cohort grow older. Under these circumstances the members of the cohort tend to enjoy improved health opportunities and improved health conditions in later life as compared with their younger years. Some research has focused on the positive effects of having survived illness in childhood, whether by acquiring immunity to various infectious diseases or by becoming physically and emotionally hardened for survival to later years. 16 Finally, early sickness and death tend to weed out the weaker members of a cohort so that the stronger members constitute a relatively larger share of the survivors in later life -an expression of the concept of heterogeneity of frailty in cohorts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1290, "end": 1292, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Early Life Influences on Health and Mortality in Later Life"}, {"text": "The life-course perspective is associated with the concept of a chain of risk, which posits that adverse experience in early life modifies the life course, usually in an adverse direction.

The rise in educational levels at each age have combined with the variations in disability according to educational level and with the declines in disability within each educational level to account for the large decrease in the overall disability ratio at each age among the elderly and in the general disability ratio of the elderly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 399, "end": 413, "text": "(Crimmins 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 414, "end": 430, "text": "(Crimmins , 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 431, "end": 450, "text": "Manton and Gu 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 451, "end": 472, "text": "Freedman et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 473, "end": 492, "text": "Manton et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 969, "end": 982, "text": "Manton et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1592, "text": ", 1982-2004/2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1727, "text": "(Parker and Thorslund 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1754, "text": "Lutz and Scherbov (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1176, "end": 1187, "text": "(Fig. 6.10)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Disabled Population"}, {"text": "About 16% of the population of the European Union was disabled in 1994-1996, according to the European Community Household Panel (Lutz and Scherbov 2003) , but data on trends in disability for the European Union and other regions of the world, such as are available for the United States, are lacking.

This expectation, however, is based on the assumption that disability ratios will remain at present levels.

The percent distribution of residents of nursing homes by length of stay since the time of admission according to the NNHS of 2004 and a few earlier years is as follows: These figures indicate not only that a large share of the residents stay less than 1 year but that the residents were staying for shorter periods in 2004 than in 1999 and 1977.
