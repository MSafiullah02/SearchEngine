Physical examination often reveals effusions. Estimation of skin turgor and thickness of lip folds, conjunctiva, and tarsal webs detects localized edema or whole-body edema (i.e., anasarca). Some effusions can be difficult to recognize without diagnostic imaging (radiographic or ultrasonographic). Abdominal effusion can be missed during palpation (balloting a fluid wave has poor predictive value). Small volumes of pleural fluid usually escape physical detection. In almost all cases, analysis of the fluid causing the effusion is crucial to proper categorization and determination of cause.",

Entrance into the pericardium may require an acute thrust. The catheter is slipped over the needle into the pericardial sac, and the needle discarded. If bloody fluid is extracted, the clinician should immediately compare packed cell volume (PCV), number of platelets, total solid concentration, supernatant color, and activated clotting time between fluid and peripheral blood.

RBCs often accumulate in effusions secondary to inflammation or vascular congestion, causing a PCV less than or equal to 8%.If the PCV is more similar to systemic blood and supernatant is clear, acute hemorrhage or iatrogenic sample contamination is likely. PCV may be artifactually lowered by hemolysis caused by fluids with very high or low tonicities, by freezing and thawing a sample, high lipid concentrations, and trauma (i.e., forced sample injection into vacutainer). If supernatant is maroon, hemolysis is probable. Erythrophagocytosis (i.e., RBCs engulfed by macrophages) and macrophages containing hemosiderin (i.e., siderocytes) occur when blood has contaminated an effusion for longer than a day. Erythrophagocytosis can also develop in fluid stored longer than a few hours. Chronically blood-contaminated samples lack platelets, and supernatant appears xanthochromic (yellow-tinged) after centrifugation. Xanthochromia reflects the presence of bilirubin pigments. A jaundiced animal has yellow effusions. Bile peritonitis usuallyproduces a brown-green or dark yellow-green effusion containing both free and engulfed bilirubin crystals.

Very small volume samples may yield falsely low cell counts because of dilution of fluid with anticoagulant. Poor sample mixing, sample contamination, prolonged storage, and medical therapy may each influence cell counts. Differential counts are best performed from concentrated cellular components. However, smears of unconcentrated fluid allow estimation of cell numbers when cell counts are greater than 1000\u03bcl.At least six slides of collected fluid should immediately be made. Slides are rapidly air-dried and stained using a modified Wright's stain such as Diff-Quik. If bacteria are visible, Gram's stain is applied. If the fluid appears relatively acellular, a portion should be centrifuged and smears made of the sediment as soon as possible. Cytospin centrifugation provides the best cellular morphology. Cytology smears should be rapidly air-dried to preserve cell morphology.

Immunohistochemical distinction of cell type has become an important diagnostic evaluation in human medicine and is just developing in veterinary medicine.

Pure transudates are typically associated with severe hypoalbuminemia (see Chapter 12; Figure 10-2\n) and are usually caused by PLN, PLE, hepatic failure, protein loss from exudative cutaneous lesions, or repeated body cavity lavage. Anorexia and emaciation alone do not produce hypoalbuminemia severe enough to elicit edema or effusion. Check for pathologic proteinuria (see Chapter 7) and hepatic insufficiency (see the discussion of bile acids in Chapter 9). Remember: PLE may occur without signs of enteric disease; enteric biopsy may be needed for diagnosis. Serum cholesterol concentration (see Chapter 8)is helpful; PLE and hepatic failure usually cause hypocholesterolemia, whereas PLN usually causes hypercholesterolemia. Involvement of portal hypertension as a pathomechanism of abdominal effusion can be discerned by measuring the serum albumin-effusion albumin (SA-EA) gradient; values greater than 1.1 suggest portal hypertension. However, considerable overlapping of SA-EA gradients occurs such that values cannot distinguish the definitive underlying cause (liver disease versus no liver disease).",

Degenerate WBCs (see Chapter 16 and Color Plate 4B) suggest infection, although some organisms do not alter neutrophil morphology (e.g., Actinomyces) (see Color Plates 4A to 4C). Degenerate changes may be the result of specimen handling. Recent abdominal trauma (e.g., exploratory laparotomy) causes mild, transient fluid neutrophilia with neutrophilic degeneration. Finding and identifying infecting organisms can be difficult, especially when bacterial numbers are low or bacteria are within a granulomatous reaction or abscess. Certain organisms are notoriously difficult to find (e.g., Nocardia and Actinomyces). Therefore all exudative effusions should be cultured aerobically and anaerobically (see Chapter 15), and samples should be immediately submitted in sterile clot tubes or transferred to appropriate transport media. If samples in transport media cannot be immediately submitted, they should be refrigerated to slow bacterial growth to avoid media substrateuse and microbe death. Finding irrefutable evidence of an infectious organism is almost always an indication for emergency exploratory surgery. Animals with probable abdominal contamination caused by recent surgery, repeated drainage, or fluid sampling are exceptions; in these cases, cultures are submitted and antimicrobial therapy tailored to the identified organisms.",

Chylopericardium is rare but may develop consequent to mediastinal venous hypertension (e.g., cardiomyopathy). Trauma, neoplasia, or coagulopathy can cause hemopericardium. Most dogs with pericardial tamponade have modified transudates or exudates (e.g., benign pericardial effusion in approximately 50% of cases; neoplasia including hemangiosarcoma of the right atrium [most common], chemodectoma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma). Cytologic differentiation of benign from malignant pericardial effusion is difficult. Fluid pH (determined using a urine dipstick) may help: Effusions with a pH greater than or equal to 7.0 are usually malignant, whereas a pH less than or equal to 6.5 suggests benign effusions (Jackson, Richter, and Launer, 1999). However, this feature appears variable. Contrast radiographs, ultrasonography, thoracoscopy, or exploratory surgery are often needed to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Pericardial biopsy via thoracoscopic sampling is the least invasive reliable method of tissue retrieval. Most cats with pericardial disease have cardiac disease (i.e., cardiomyopathy, valve abnormalities), neoplasia (i.e., lymphoma, metastatic carcinomas), chronic renal disease (uremic pericarditis), coagulopathies or more rarely, bacterial infection. Intrapericardial cysts rarely cause serosanguineous modified transudates or exudates in dogs; diagnosis is based on echocardiography.",

Joint pain may be subtle; joints should be carefully palpated for mobility, swelling, and discomfort. Synovial fluid analysis distinguishes noninflammatory from inflammatory conditions; examination of joint fluid may be helpful in animals with fever of unknown origin. Many immune-mediated diseases involve joints. Very small amounts of fluid are available from most normal joints; therefore, collecting relatively large volumes suggests effusion. Acute and inflammatory conditions cause effusion, whereas chronic and noninflammatory disorders produce joint enlargement due to soft tissue swelling but yield little fluid. If arthrocentesis is performed to evaluate fever or unexplained lameness in an animal without swollen joints, at least two or three joints should be sampled (carpal and tarsal usually preferred).",

Unfortunately, many dogs with septic joints have minimal to no degenerative neutrophils. Concurrent antibiotic therapy may cause underestimation of infection because of suppression of degenerativeneutrophil changes, suppressed numbers of organisms, and negative culture results. Some agents may not cause degenerative neutrophils and are not cytologically detectable (e.g., mycoplasma, rickettsia, L-form bacteria, viruses [calicivirus in cats, postvaccinalarthritides]). Most canine polyarthritis is nonspecifically immune-mediated. Feline poly-arthritis (i.e., chronic progressive polyarthritis) is linked (statistically) with feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. If minimal amountsof fluid are aspirated, the syringe and needle can be rinsed with broth-enrichment media and this rinse cultured; synovial fluid preincubated in blood culture media for 24 hours also may yield more positive cultures. In chronic low-grade infections, culturing synovial tissue biopsies may be more productive than synovial fluid culture. If synovial fluid infection is present, blood and urine cultures plus echocardiography are reasonable next steps. Omphalophlebitis may be the source of infection in young animals. Serologictesting for borreliosis (i.e., Lyme disease) may help diagnose inflammatory arthritis of unknown cause; however, interpretation of Borrelia titers is difficult (see Chapter 15).Response to therapy may be the most compelling basis for diagnosing Lyme disease or rickettsial polyarthropathies.",

Ragocytes, lupus erythematosus (LE) cells, or both indicate immune-mediated disease (see Color Plate 5A). Submission of sera for antinuclear antibody (AN) and rheumatoid factor titers (see Chapter 12), blood for LE cell preparations, and synovial biopsies for histologic evaluation may implicate immunodestructive processes. Chronic, progressive feline polyarthritis usually occurs in males and has two forms. The periosteal-proliferative form is most prevalent, primarily affecting young adult cats and causing tenosynovitis followed by nondeforming periarticular periosteal proliferation and subchondral bone erosions. The deforming or rheumatoid-like arthritis form has an insidious onsetin older cats and is associated with severe subchondral bone destruction, joint insta-bility, and deformity. Feet, carpi, and tarsiare severely and symmetrically affected.\nThe most common cause of noninflammatory joint disease is degenerative arthritis because of trauma or joint instability.

Total body water retention because ofinappropriate elaboration of antidiuretichormone (ADH) (see Chapter 6) coexistswith other disorders that overshadow its presence. Retention of sodium because of increased renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone occurs in patients with severe renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease having hypoalbuminemia. Systemic hypertension often occurs when the renin-angiotensin axis is the primary abnormality. History, physical examination, serum albumin determination, thoracic radiographs, cardiac evaluations (i.e., ECG, echocardiography), CVP determinations, and urinalysis assist in confirmingthe cause of anasarca (see Figure 10-9). Finding a jugular pulse or abnormal hepatojugular reflex suggests intrathoracic disease. If an underlying cause is not found, physical examination and laboratory data are reviewed looking for evidence of vasculitis (i.e., petechiation, fundic examination for microvascular lesions, microscopic hematuria, blood smear looking for schistocytes).
