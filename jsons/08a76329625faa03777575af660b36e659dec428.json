Chisquare test and logistic regression were conducted for data analysis using SPSS ver. 21.0., and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. Results: 76.1% of respondents used one or more types of CAM modalities during the MERS outbreak. Consumption of easily accessible modalities such as multivitamin (51.2%) and food products (32.1%) was most popular, and the majority of CAM users relied on mass media (52.4%) and the internet (27.4%) to obtain information on CAM. The use of CAM was associated with age between 40 and 49, age over 50, prior CAM use, and dissatisfaction with the government response to the MERS outbreak.",

The characteristics and mechanisms of MERS transmission have been well investigated since the outbreak [5] [6] [7] . Specifically, MERS deaths in Korea can be attributed to the absence of effective vaccination and treatment for MERS, weak healthcare system for epidemic control, and ill-prepared hospitals with a deficiency in professional expertise, as well as negative pressure room for isolation of MERS patients [7] [8] [9] [10] . Furthermore, increased incidences of nosocomial infection of MERS during the outbreak in 2015 elevated the fear, panic, and anger among the general public [11, 12] .",

In Korea, consumption of natural products such as a multivitamin, whole grain, and probiotics was popular during the MERS outbreak, which were the modalities that are widely used for the management and treatment of common cold and influenza-like illnesses [24] . Such similarities in modalities used support existing findings that people's decision to use particular CAM is influenced by specific physical symptoms experienced and self-assessed health care needs [45, 46] . Our findings also show differences in the use of self-administered modalities (multivitamin, nutritional supplements, food products, and exercise) and practitioner-administered modalities (massage, yoga, and traditional Korean medicine). Higher preference of self-administered CAM modalities in our study implies that in order to protect themselves from an outbreak event, people are more likely to rely on self-medication and minimize the risk of exposure. In fact, a high proportion of Koreans during the 2015 MERS outbreak avoided the crowded area and health facilities to prevent infection [2] .",

During the MERS outbreak in Korea, the most common sources were mass media (newspaper, television, radio) and the internet, which were the least popular among patients with chronic disease and non-airborne infectious disease [32, [47] [48] [49] . Observed dependence on the mass media can be attributed to many health professionals using the mass media to provide advice on precautionary and self-care measures during the outbreak of MERS. Furthermore, similar to the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong [50] , the majority of respondents also reported the mass media as the main source of disease-related information during the MERS outbreak in Korea. These findings reflect the importance of mass media accessed by the public during health emergencies, as the information provided has a critical role in the formation of risk perception and influence health behavior [51] [52] [53] .",

As for sociodemographic characteristics, previous studies found female gender, younger age, and tertiary education level to be associated with CAM use among people with risk of disease development [54, 55] . However, on the contrary, only the higher age groups (being 40 to 49 years of age, being over 50 years of age) were more likely to use CAM in our study. This incongruency may be due to differences in the sample size of the study and characteristics of diseases, as in the case of infectious disease outbreaks, higher perceived vulnerability among elders could influence them to engage in health-promoting behaviors [14, 56] . In the case of health belief-related factors, those who used CAM prior to the outbreak and showed dissatisfaction with the government response to the outbreak were more likely to use CAM in the present study. Similarly, previous studies found distrust in the government and dissatisfaction with the conventional health care system to be associated with CAM use [16, 57] . These results suggest that individuals who find the formal health care system to be unreliable resort to CAM to compensate for the lack of perceived-health care quality, to practice autonomy, and to protect themselves from health threats [16, [57] [58] [59] . However, the findings remain inconclusive, and further research is needed to improve our understanding of the determinants of CAM use during epidemic events.",
