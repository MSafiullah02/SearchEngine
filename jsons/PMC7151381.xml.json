Some countries have been hit earlier and with lightning violence, leading to the collapse of health facilities and putting public health to test. This epidemiologic and social emergency puts at risk of undertreatment not only patients with acute infections but also health care pathways for other diseases. Diagnostic tests and hospital facilities are largely used for patients with COVID-19, and most resources are invested in this field. Nevertheless, it is our duty, as surgical specialists, not to forget our patients, especially patients with cancer. What is happening to the lung cancer pathways of referral and treatment? For how long do we have to face this emergency? What will be the cost in terms of lung cancer-related death in this scenario?",
