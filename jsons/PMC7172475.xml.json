With the exception of hantaviruses, bunyaviruses are transmitted by arthropod vectors and consequently belong to the superfamily of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Many are human pathogens and cause severe pathologies such as fatal hepatitis, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and acute fever. Due to their mode of transmission, they are considered potential agents of emerging diseases. No treatments or vaccines are currently approved by the FDA for human use.",

UUKV belongs to the genus Phlebovirus and is thus related to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), an important human pathogen (Pettersson and Kaariainen, 1973). Little information is available on Phlebovirus entry. Low pH has been shown to affect the biochemical properties of the UUKV glycoproteins and induces fusion of cells expressing the glycoproteins of RVFV (Filone et al., 2006, Overby et al., 2008). This suggests that host cell entry of phleboviruses is dependent on low pH. To analyze the entry of UUKV into mammalian tissue culture cells, we developed sensitive, quantitative tools and assays that allowed us to determine general properties of the UUKV entry process including binding, internalization, membrane trafficking, and acid-activated penetration.",

The characterization of the fluorescently and radiolabeled particles is shown in Figure S2. The purity of the labeled UUKV preparations was greater than 90%. In the radioactive virus, the 35S label was present in N, GN, and GC, whereas GN and GC were the only fluorescently labeled proteins in the UUKV-RED preparation (Figures S2A and S2B). That the nucleoprotein N was not fluorescent indicated that the viral envelope was intact. The different labeled particles could be visualized as single spots by confocal fluorescence microscopy and as 132 nm particles by EM after negative staining (Figures S2C\u2013S2E). We noticed no significant impact of labeling on UUKV infectivity; the titers were similar to those of nonlabeled particles (Figure S2F).",

The results showed that binding increased with increasing concentration of input UUKV (Figure 1A), but with all three cell lines the fraction that associated with the cells was 7%\u20139% (Figure 1B). When the supernatant from a binding experiment was added to new cells, the fraction of radioactivity bound was similar, suggesting that the unbound virus was fully capable of cell association (Figure 1C).

After 40 min, the cells were placed back on ice to stop further endocytosis. To distinguish between internalized and surface-bound particles, the cells were treated with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 30 min on ice. Since TCEP is a membrane-impermeable reducing agent, it only removed the dye from UUKV-RED still exposed at the plasma membrane. In samples treated with TCEP before warming, we observed little background fluorescence (Figure 3A [4\u00b0C, +TCEP]), whereas after warming internalized viruses could be seen as fluorescent spots of different intensities within the cells (Figure 3A [37\u00b0C, +TCEP]). We estimated that 25% of the cell-bound particles were internalized within 40 min.",

The decrease in infection was only 35% for both CHC siRNAs compared to the control cells transfected with a control siRNA (Figure 3E). As a control for assessing the effectiveness of CHC knockdown, we used Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which exclusively uses the clathrin pathway (Doxsey et al., 1987). In contrast to UUKV, infection with SFV was strongly inhibited in these cells, with a 75%\u201380% decrease in comparison to the control (Figure 3E).

The level of vATPV1A protein was reduced by 85%\u201395% as assayed by western blotting (Figure S4C). The silencing led to a strong inhibition of UUKV infection (from 75% to 95%) (Figure S4D).

The majority were located in noncoated indentations at the plasma membrane and after endocytosis in noncoated, small cytoplasmic vesicles. The vesicles could represent CCV that had lost their clathrin coat or primary vesicles in a clathrin-independent pathway. The marginal effect of CHC knockdown compared to SFV could reflect the diversity of endocytic pathways used by UUKV or also differences in the role of clathrin in other processes, such as receptor recycling. Together, the results suggested that the majority of UUKV particles use a clathrin-independent pathway for infectious entry. After endocytic uptake, viruses were observed in larger vesicles, with the morphology of EE, LE, and MVE indicating that after internalization the viruses were channeled into the classical endosome pathway.",

The first indication that UUKV shares this penetration strategy was the sensitivity of infection to agents that elevate vacuolar pH. Using NH4Cl, we showed that the first viruses reached the acid-dependent step 5 min after cell warming, and that half of the incoming, infectious particles passed the NH4Cl-sensitive step within 12 min. The time course resembled that of other viruses penetrating from LE, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), influenza A, and minor rhinoviruses (Martin and Helenius, 1991, Prchla et al., 1994, Quirin et al., 2008). These viruses pass the acid-sensitive step typically with a half-time of 10\u201320 min. For comparison, viruses fusing in EE, such as VSV or SFV, become NH4Cl insensitive within 5 min as their uptake is almost instantaneously followed by acid activation (Johannsdottir et al., 2009, Quirin et al., 2008).",

In both cases, fusion was triggered at pH below 5.8 with an optimum at 5.4. These are relatively low pH values; i.e., comparable to influenza A virus and thus consistent with penetration in LE. By forcing the glycoproteins of other bunyaviruses to the cell surface through overexpression, others have measured cell-cell fusion \u201cfrom within\u201d and found that formation of syncitia occurred at slightly higher pH values, namely 5.8\u20136.4 with a threshold of about 6.0 (Filone et al., 2006, Plassmeyer et al., 2007).

In contrast, Rab5a Q79L and wortmannin, which cause expansion of EE and prevent proper LE maturation, only affected the late-penetrating viruses influenza A virus and UUKV. Similar observations have been recently reported for parvoviruses and for human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2), which are late penetrating (Brabec et al., 2006, Harbison et al., 2009). That Rab5a Q79L had no adverse effect on SFV infection suggested that the pH in the giant EE was low enough to mediate fusion of this early-penetrating virus.

However, given the many indications that UUKV entered LE and used them for penetration, it was surprising that the inactive mutant Rab7 T22N did not have a more dramatic effect on infection. However, expression of Rab7 T22N has also not been found to affect infection by other late-penetrating viruses such as LCMV (Quirin et al., 2008). There could be many explanations for this, such as the presence of multiple isoforms of Rab7, the lack of dominant-negative effect of the mutant, mislocalization of the mutant Rabs, etc. (Bucci et al., 2000).

They include influenza A virus, dengue virus serotype 2 strain 1, HRV2, LCMV, canine and feline parvoviruses, murine and simian 40 polyomaviruses, and human papillomavirus 16 (Brabec et al., 2006, Harbison et al., 2009, Mercer et al., 2010, Qian et al., 2009, Quirin et al., 2008, Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003, van der Schaar et al., 2008). Although they use diverse cell surface receptors, signaling pathways, and primary endocytic mechanisms, most of them seem to pass through EE, from which they are sorted into the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway. Penetration is not activated in EE. Instead they move together with endocytosed cargo and intralumenal vesicles into maturing endosomes, LE, endolysosomes, and lysosomes deeper into the cell. Typically, penetration occurs in the maturing endosomes or LE, but even later compartments cannot be excluded for some of them. The main distinction between these viruses and early-penetrating viruses such as SFV and VSV is that they have a lower pH threshold (5.4\u20135.8) of activation and therefore a longer half-time of penetration (>10\u201315 min) (Mercer et al., 2010). Viruses of the polyoma family are exceptions because they continue from late endosomal organelles to the endoplasmic reticulum where penetration occurs (Qian et al., 2009). Unlike early-penetrating viruses, late viruses are sensitive to treatments that inhibit the proper maturation of LE and cargo transport into the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway. With the results presented here, UUKV can be confidently classified as a member of this interesting group of viruses, the detailed cell biology of which remains a challenge for future work.",
