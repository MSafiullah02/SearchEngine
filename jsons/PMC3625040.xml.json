            "text": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) is a master regulator of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. As shown in Fig. 1\n, this system is a multi-enzymatic cascade in which angiotensinogen, the major substrate, is processed in a two-step reaction by renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), resulting in the sequential generation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. In recent years, several new enzymes, peptides, and receptors in this system have been identified, manifesting a complexity that was previously unappreciated. Although appropriate activation of the RAS is vital for preventing circulatory collapse and maintaining intravascular fluid balance, dysregulation and/or persistent RAS activation can lead to inappropriate blood pressure elevation, target organ damage, and even reduced survival [1]. Accordingly, pharmacological agents that inhibit the synthesis or activity of angiotensin II are effective and widely used anti-hypertensive agents [2] that can ameliorate morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular diseases including congestive heart failure [3], [4] and slow the progression of a wide range of progressive kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy [5]. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which block type 1 (AT1) receptors, are similarly effective for treating these disorders [6], [7], [8]. Below, we will review selected recent advances in understanding the physiology of the RAS with an emphasis on actions impacting the kidney.",

            "text": "The aspartyl protease renin is synthesized as a precursor protein, prorenin [9]. Active renin is then generated by removal of an N-terminal peptide fragment, presumably by proteases in the kidney. Active renin specifically cleaves the 10 amino acids from the N-terminus of angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I. As angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are present in excess, at least in the circulation, the level of renin is a key rate-limiting step determining the level of angiotensin II and thus the activity of the RAS. The primary source of renin in the circulation is the kidney, where its expression and secretion are tightly regulated at the juxta-glomerular (JG) apparatus by a renal baroreceptor [10] and sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa, which is sensed by chloride flux through the NKCC2 transporter expressed on the luminal side of macula densa cells [11], [12]. Recent studies confirm that the pathway linked to triggering renin release by the macula densa involves generation of PGE2 by cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 with subsequent activation of the EP4 receptor for PGE2\n[13]. Of note, activity of the pathway is unaffected by the absence of either of the two putative microsomal PGE synthase enzymes indicating a possible role for atypical or perhaps non-enzymatic pathways for PGE2 synthesis. Microarray studies have affirmed the unique identity of the renin-producing JG cell [14] and have also elucidated a role for micro-RNAs to maintain the phenotype of JG cells and regulate their emergence from precursors among smooth muscle cells in the renal arteriole [15], [16]. At a transcriptional level, Liver X receptors enhance renin generation within JG cells through interactions with the renin promoter [17] and can even induce differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into renin-secreting \u201cJG-like\u201d cells [18]. However, other studies suggest that renin may also be generated in epithelial cells of the proximal, connecting, and/or collecting tubule of the nephron [19], [20]. While there is some controversy regarding the physiological relevance of renin in the distal nephron, the impact of dietary salt, blood pressure and angiotensin II levels on its expression seems to be paradoxical compared to renin at the JGA. For example, angiotensin II suppresses renin at the JGA but stimulates renin mRNA and protein formation in the collecting duct [20], an effect that appears to be independent of blood pressure [21].",

In addition, studies using a putative antagonist peptide synthesized from the handle-region of the pro-renin molecule suggest a role for the pro-renin receptor to promote kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy [24], [25]. However, the effectiveness of this peptide appears to be inconsistent and its ability to block signaling at the pro-renin receptor has been questioned [26].",

For example, it is found as part of a complex required for the normal function of V-ATPase in several cell lineages including cardiac myocytes [27]. The pro-renin receptor acts as an adaptor between the Wnt receptor and V-ATPase in a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling complex required for normal CNS development [28]. Thus deletion of the pro-renin receptor gene causes a lethal phenotype at a very early embryonic stage, which contrasts significantly with the phenotype of renin knockouts [29], indicating important functions of the receptor that are independent of its actions in the RAS. Two groups have recently described studies of mouse lines in which the pro-renin receptor was deleted specifically from podocytes. In both cases, there was a similar, dramatic phenotype characterized by disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier, with marked proteinuria and abnormal podocyte structure, perhaps due to dysregulated autophagy [30], [31]. Thus, while this molecule appears to play a critical role in the kidney, much remains to be learned about its functions in normal kidney physiology and disease, including the extent to which these functions are influenced by renin or pro-renin binding.",

While it has been suggested that there is an excess of angiotensinogen substrate in human plasma relative to renin, other studies suggest that alterations of plasma angiotensinogen levels can affect the relative activity of the RAS. For example, a variant of the human AGT gene that is associated with higher plasma levels of angiotensinogen is also associated with the development of hypertension [32]. In addition, gene titration studies in transgenic mice engineered to carry from 0 to 4 copies of the Agt gene demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of Agt gene copies, plasma levels of angiotensinogen, and blood pressure [33]. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that changes in conformation of the angiotensinogen molecule caused by exposure to oxidative stress can significantly modify the kinetics of its cleavage by renin [34]. These data indicate that oxidative stress may exert independent control of the activity of the RAS by facilitating the generation of angiotensin I.",

Changes in levels of angiotensinogen in these tissues may impact the activity of local renin\u2013angiotensin systems through mechanisms that are quite independent of angiotensinogen in the circulation. For example, in the kidney, synthesis of angiotensinogen in proximal tubule may be augmented by angiotensin II [36] as part of a local, intra-renal RAS that is regulated independently of the systemic RAS. This apparent \u201cfeed-forward\u201d system may impact the function of epithelial cells along the nephron to enhance sodium reabsorption and hypertension. Accordingly, urinary angiotensinogen may be used to monitor RAS activation in the kidney in patients with hypertension and some forms of chronic kidney disease [37], [38].",

ACE inhibitors were the first small molecule therapeutic agents targeting the RAS and have become an essential component for treatment of a wide range of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Polymorphisms of the human ACE gene have been linked to differing susceptibilities to hypertension, cardiovascular and renal diseases [40], [41]. The insertion (I) allele containing an Alu repeat is associated with lower circulating levels of ACE compared to the so-called deletion (D) allele without the repeat. The D allele has been linked to enhanced risk for renal and cardiovascular disease [42], [43]. It has been suggested that the mechanism underlying this increased risk is related to the higher levels of circulating ACE associated with the D allele. However, gene titration studies failed to show an effect of differences in circulating levels of ACE between 62 and 144% on blood pressure in mice [44]. On the other hand, incremental differences ACE levels may be sufficient to affect local generation of angiotensin II in specific target tissues such as the kidney or may impact metabolism of other target peptides such as bradykinin. In this regard, experiments in mice using conventional gene targeting are consistent with a gene dosage effect for Ace in STZ diabetes [45].",

Recently, the relatively promiscuous carboxyl dipeptidase activity of ACE has been implicated in regulation of the immune system [47]. Bernstein and associates showed that ACE participates in processing peptides within antigen presenting cells (APCs) for loading onto MHC class I antigens and as such, plays a role in influencing immune surveillance and development of the T cell repertoire. By editing prospective antigens before their presentation to CD8+ T lymphocytes in the context of MHC class I, ACE can alter not only the set of self-antigens that drive deletion and/or tolerization of autoreactive T cells but also the foreign antigens that shape the acquired cell-mediated response to an exogenous immune stimulus. Other recent studies (discussed below) have highlighted a role of the RAS to influence immune responses that are relevant to the development of hypertension and kidney injury.",

ACE2 has now been implicated in a variety of disorders including hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis, and diabetic nephropathy [49], [50], [51], [52]. With regard to the RAS, ACE2 can influence its activity through at least two pathways. First, angiotensin II is a substrate of ACE2, and thus ACE2 represents a metabolic pathway for angiotensin II to extinguish its activity [49]. In addition, removal of one amino acid from the carboxyl-terminus of angiotensin II generates angiotensin 1\u20137, which has a number of putative biological actions [53]. For example, accumulating evidence indicates that this peptide causes vasodilation, natriuresis and may promote reduced blood pressures [54] via activation of the Mas receptor [55]. On the other hand, administration of recombinant ACE2 degrades plasma angiotensin II and lowers blood pressure independently of any effects on angiotensin 1\u20137 generation [56]. Thus, the functions of ACE2 may be determined by its distinct actions to metabolize angiotensin II and to generate angiotensin 1\u20137. Moreover, exploitation of the salubrious effects of angiotensin 1\u20137 may offer therapeutic potential for the treatment of progressive kidney disease [57].",

A kidney cross-transplantation approach using wild-type and AT1A receptor-deficient mice illustrated equal and non-redundant contributions of AT1 receptors in the kidney and in systemic tissues to the maintenance of normal blood pressure [66], suggesting that AT1 receptors in many of these tissue sites are utilized to protect body fluid volumes in order to prevent circulatory collapse. By contrast, other studies using this cross-transplantation approach confirmed a dominant contribution of AT1 receptors in the kidney to promote sodium retention and blood pressure elevation in hypertension [67]. More recently, conditional deletion of AT1A receptors selectively within epithelial cells of the proximal tubule in the kidney demonstrated an important role for AT1 receptors in the proximal nephron in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of angiotensin II-dependent hypertension.

For example, angiotensin II acting via AT1 receptors stimulates sodium\u2013hydrogen exchange in the cortical and outer medullary collecting tubule by increasing the density of the vacuolar sodium\u2013hydrogen ATPase in the apical membrane of the type A intercalated cell, which in turn leads to an increase in bicarbonate reabsorption [69]. On the apical membrane of the principal cells in the cortical collecting duct (CCD), luminal angiotensin II stimulates amiloride-sensitive sodium transport by increasing activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) through an AT1 receptor-dependent mechanism [70]. As the distal nephron ultimately determines urine flow and composition, actions of angiotensin II to modulate sodium handling at this site may impact blood pressure homeostasis [70], [71], a hypothesis that will require testing through targeted in vivo studies.",

For example, mice with complete deficiency of AT1A receptors have a urinary concentrating defect with an attenuated increase in urine osmolality after water deprivation or vasopressin administration [72]. However, the precise mechanism of this effect was not clear. To determine whether direct actions of AT1 receptors in epithelial cells of the collecting duct regulate water reabsorption by the kidney, mice were generated with AT1A receptors deleted from the epithelium of the collecting duct with Cre-Loxp technology. Following water deprivation or vasopressin administration, urine osmolalities were consistently lower in the mice lacking AT1A receptors in collecting duct. Likewise, after water deprivation, levels of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein in inner and outer medulla were significantly diminished, whereas localization to the apical membrane was unaffected [73]. These results indicate direct effects of AT1A receptors in collecting duct epithelial cells to regulate water reabsorption by modulating AQP2 levels. These actions are required to achieve maximal urinary concentration.",

AT2 receptors are found in abundance during fetal development [75], [76] but their expression generally falls after birth. Nevertheless, persistent AT2 receptor expression can be detected in several adult tissues including the kidney, adrenal gland and the brain, and absolute levels of AT2 receptor expression may be modulated by angiotensin II and certain growth factors [77].

Gene expression and ligand-binding studies have demonstrated the presence of AT1 receptors and other RAS components on several mononuclear cell populations [87], [88], but a role for the immune system RAS in hypertension has only recently emerged. In a seminal study, Guzik and colleagues found that the absence of functional lymphocytes in Rag1-deficient mice largely abrogated the chronic hypertensive response to angiotensin II and that reconstitution with T cells but not B cells could restore blood pressure elevation in this model [89]. The exact mechanism through which T cells contribute to angiotensin II-dependent hypertension is not entirely clear but may involve modulation of vascular responses and/or effects on renal sodium handling [89], [90]. Putative antigens responsible for activating the adaptive immune response in hypertension have not been identified. Nevertheless, the ability of T cells to mediate angiotensin II-induced hypertension also requires activation of co-stimulatory pathways in the T cell by B7 molecules on the antigen-presenting cell (\u201cSignal 2\u201d), pointing to an antigen-specific mechanism of classical T cell stimulation [91]. Whether angiotensin II stimulates the immune system through direct activation of AT1 receptors on inflammatory cells remains controversial as AT1 receptor-deficiency on bone marrow-derived cells is protective in angiotensin II-induced hypertension [92], and stimulation of the CNS by angiotensin II can activate T cells indirectly [93].",

Angiotensin II appears to exacerbate renal injury in this model in part by inducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the kidney including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [95] as TNF-\u03b1 blockade abrogates angiotensin II-induced renal injury [94]. Although most studies have emphasized that angiotensin II exacerbates tissue damage through immune stimulation, recent experiments show that the induction of immunosuppressive T regulatory cells by angiotensin II can provide cardioprotection and even blunt the hypertensive response [96], [97].
