Although several practices have been proposed for BPD prevention, none of these in isolation prevent BPD. Methods Our initiative focused on two key drivers: oxygen management and noninvasive ventilation strategies. We created best practice guidelines and followed outcome measures using Shewhart control charts. Results PDSAs of protocols preceded a large-scale rollout of a \"0.21 by 28\" campaign in 2014 leading to a special cause reduction in the \"any BPD\" rate, and a decrease in severe BPD (from 57 to 29%). At the end of 2017, we reinvigorated the project, which led to dramatic decreases in the \"any BPD\" rate to 41% and the \"severe BPD\" rate to 21%. Conclusions A multidisciplinary QI initiative focused on process improvement geared towards the pathophysiological contributors of BPD has successfully reduced the rate of BPD in an all referral level IV NICU.",

BPD incidence is inversely correlated with gestational age at delivery and is the highest among infants born <1000 g (extremely low birthweight (ELBW)) [3] . Since the incidence of BPD is significantly higher among ELBW infants, transfer to tertiary centers for definitive care is required where, in some studies, the rate of BPD approaches 100% [4] .

Because the interventions focused on developing protocols, all PDSAs involved having progressively larger numbers of individuals from multiple disciplines test the practicality of the protocols and provide feedback. Our protocol development targeted three major pathophysiological contributors to BPD. First, to reduce pulmonary barotrauma, we developed an RT-driven protocol to speed extubation of infants in the NICU (Supplementary Fig. 2) . Second, to reduce oxygen toxicity, we revised our oxygen saturation guidelines and emphasized the goal of being on 21% oxygen by DOL 28 (\"0.21 by 28\" campaign). The target saturations for all infants under 32 weeks PMA, which had previously varied by provider, was standardized at 90-95%. Third, to reduce oxygen need, scarring, and inflammation from atelectasis, we developed a noninvasive respiratory support protocol encouraging the use of CPAP through 36-weeks PMA unless the infant could come off CPAP without requiring more than minimal oxygen beyond 32 weeks PMA ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). The intention of these efforts were to minimize practice variations in respiratory modalities offered to the babies. The three protocols were introduced simultaneously in April 2014.",

For example, internal data collected through 2017 showed poor compliance with saturation alarm limit settings, with many set inappropriately at 100%. Therefore, in late 2017 we launched a \"reinvigoration\" of the project and added more interventions based on the two primary drivers.
