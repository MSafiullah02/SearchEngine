Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI<25 kg/m 2 : 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m 2 : 17.2%, BMI\u226535 kg/m 2 : 34.8%, p= 0.03).

The most interesting finding of our analysis is that severe obesity is a significant factor for Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f severe respiratory disease and death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It should be pointed out that this association remained significant even after adjusting for several clinical entities, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, COPD, CKD or ESRD, and smoking, which indicates that obesity may predispose to negative outcomes independently. The higher mortality rates in the BMI<25 kg/m 2 and BMI \u226535 kg/m 2 groups allow to make a hypothesis of a J-shaped distribution between BMI and mortality. However, this was not confirmed in our adjusted analysis presumably because of our small sample and the inherent coexisting factors associated with BMI<25 (older age, frailty).",

Another report from China indicated that the presence of obesity in patients with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease is associated with an almost 6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 [19] . Obesity could partially explain why the mortality rate for COVID-19 is higher in countries with higher prevalence of obesity, such as Italy, as compared to China and Japan [20] . Variables such as diabetes and other cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities were found to have a significant association in prior reports from China and Italy [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, most of these were obtained J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f from univariate estimates only.

The Bronx has the highest rate of diabetes among all sixty-two counties of the New York state and one of the highest rates of hypertension [26] . Additionally, the prevalence of obesity is higher among individuals of lower socioeconomic status (>35%) and substantially higher in non-Hispanic blacks (36%) and Hispanic (35.4%) as compared to non-Hispanic whites (19.1%) [9] . The patient population that our institution serves mainly includes patients of lower socioeconomic status and people that identify themselves as African American or Hispanic. The combination of these two made up 85.5% of our current study population that is representative of racial and ethnical distribution in the Bronx [27] . The median income, as estimated by the zip codes based on publicly available data provided by the internal revenue service, was not found to be a risk factor for worse outcomes in our study, which is explained by the fact that the Bronx is a homogenous area of low income.",
