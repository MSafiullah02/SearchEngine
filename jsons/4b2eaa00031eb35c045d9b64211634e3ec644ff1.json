These tests differ between one another in several ways. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, and assessed their real-world performance under scenarios of varying proportion of infected individuals. We included independent studies that specified the antigen used for antibody detection and used quantitative methods. We identified nine independent studies, of which six were based on commercial ELISA or CMIA/CLIA assays, and three on in-house tests. Test sensitivity ranged from 68% to 93% for IgM, from 65% to 100% for IgG, and from 83% to 98% for total antibodies. Random-effects models yielded a summary sensitivity of 82% (95%CI 75-88%) for IgM, and 85% for both IgG (95%CI 73-93%) and total antibodies (95%CI 74-94%). Specificity was very high for most tests, and its pooled estimate was 98% (95%CI 92-100%) for IgM and 99% (95%CI 98-100%) for both IgG and total antibodies. The heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity across tests was generally high (I 2 >50%). In populations with a low prevalence (\u22645%) of seroconverted individuals, the positive predictive value would be \u226488% for most assays, except those reporting perfect specificity.",

These tests may prove less helpful in quantifying the actual number of COVID-19 cases in the population, as a large proportion of infected individuals are thought to be asymptomatic [1] [2] or may not seek medical care because of mild symptoms, thus going unnoticed by surveillance systems and public health entities. Moreover, once the infection is resolved, RT-PCR tests are not informative for the previous infection. In order to overcome these shortcomings, serology-based tests are being increasingly used with the aim of gaining greater detail into the true prevalence of COVID-19 and to assess the degree of herd immunity that has been achieved in the population. Serology-based tests have thus become a key public health element in the COVID-19 pandemic and there has been a rapid growth in the number of available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests over recent months. These tests differ between one another in several ways, including the antigens used for antibody detection, the type of antibodies identified, and the laboratory method. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, and assessed what their real-world performance under scenarios of varying proportion of infected individuals.",

Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were obtained through random-effects models after Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. DOR were pooled by fitting a bivariate model which takes into account the correlation between sensitivity and specificity and uses their log-transformed values as normally distributed variables. Between-studies heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistics, which quantifies the percentage of variation attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance.

Mostly due to the low proportion of false positives, the pooled DOR was generally very high (\u22482,800 for IgM, and \u22481,300 for IgG and total antibodies).

Specificity was generally very high (\u226598%), yet this may not suffice to guarantee satisfactory real-world performance in areas with a very low prevalence of infected individuals. A specificity just less than perfect (99%) would in fact produce a PPV ranging between 76% and 88% when combined with a true prevalence equal to 5%, meaning that around one fifth of those labelled as seroconverted would in reality be false positives.",

Moreover, issues of cost, speed, and availability should also be taken into account when planning large seroprevalence surveys, as well as the medical and non-medical costs of diagnostic errors. While the currently available serological tests can be used for research purposes, our data suggest that their use for large-scale prevalence surveys (or to grant \"immunity passports\") are currently only justified (and only if showing very high diagnostic accuracy) in hard-hit regions, while they should be used with caution elsewhere. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 serological tests are being developed at a fast pace, and these conclusions may need revision in the coming months, also depending on the further spread of the pandemic.",

The reviewed studies had sample sizes ranging between 46 and 436 subjects. For IgM, sensitivity ranged from 68% in Liu et al. (in-house test) to 93% in Lou et al.
