There is a good chance that coronavirus will disrupt our control in many areas including loss of beds (including ITU) for elective surgery, staff sickness with resulting to alterations \u201cnormal\u201d working practice or diminished teams providing care, all of which might leave us with the feeling of having \u201clost control\u201d. It is important not to become angry with other teams trying to secure beds or other resources for our elective operating lists, but instead to look at the wider situation unfolding before us. Most colleagues regret their incivility to others. Not only might this damage present and future working relationships but when it happens on a regular basis this behaviour can also raise the risk of burnout for the perpetrator.13\n",
