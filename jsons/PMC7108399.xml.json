In the case of TB, recent literature has correlated the production of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-4\u03b42 (a splice variant of IL-4 and an IL-4 antagonist) with the propensity of a latently infected host to succumb to active tuberculosis. The production of IL-4\u03b42 is correlated with the control of the disease [11]. Focus on the type of immune response needed to engender protection against TB seems to be orientated (convincingly) towards suppression of IL-4 and the long standing dogma advocating the importance of Th1 type cytokines (such as interferon gamma, IFN-\u03b3) in TB resistance [12, 13].",

HIV, in common with Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis (B and C) and herpes simplex virus, normally establishes chronic infection. Opinion is divided as to what type of immune response is required in the control of HIV. Neutralizing antibodies might be efficient in blocking virus particles but poorly effective against cell-associated virus, whereas some cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are effective against virally infected cells but not against free virus particles. Latent infection facilitates immune evasion and the rate of mutation inherent in HIV also facilitates evasion (by escape from responding T cells [14]). Promising vaccine strategies will likely depend upon highly conserved epitopes and upon vaccine strategies that induce potent immune responses capable of driving cytotoxicity and producing broadly effective neutralizing antibodies [15].",

The understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic and autoimmune diseases has led to several proposed associations and causes for these diseases. It has been shown that high-affinity T cells can out-compete lower-affinity T cells during responses to antigen in vivo [16]. Competition between T cells provides the basis for the argument that maintaining a balanced peripheral immune system might also be a side effect of normal competition for shared resources within an intact immune system [17], a mechanism proposed to be responsible for the increased occurrence of these diseases, where hypersensitivity is normally passively controlled by expansion of immune cells specific for prevalent infectious agents. Autoimmunity can have strong associations with exposure to crossreactive proteins, and genes encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are strongly associated with some autoimmune diseases, but this is markedly less so for allergy. Allergy and autoimmunity are thought to differ by virtue of their regulation through central and peripheral tolerance. Genetic predisposition and environmental exposure are believed to play key roles in the development of asthma and atopy [18], with the significant increase in the incidence of these disorders thought to provide evidence for the involvement of various environmental factors, especially in developed countries [19].",

It is thought that most or all paraneoplastic neurological disorders (neurological disorders remote from the site of a malignant neoplasm or its metastases) are immune mediated [22] and this has been cited as evidence for the involvement of specific immune responses in cancer suppression [23]. Indeed, failure to find the relevant antigen in the cancer of a patient should prompt a search for a second cancer [24]. Immunotherapy has recently achieved much interest as a possible addition to chemotherapeutic treatment [25] and this could open up a new and innovative avenue for clinical trials. Effective chemotherapy against Schistosoma mansoni with praziquantel is dependent on the presence of antibodies recognizing schistosome glycoprotein epitopes [26].

Examples of immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies are Campath\u00ae (alemtuzumab), manufactured by Genzyme for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and Rituxan\u00ae (Rituximab), a chimeric murine\u2013human monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Despite the elucidation of an attenuated vaccination strategy against rabies and other inactivated whole-organism vaccines towards the end of the nineteenth century, it wasn't until the cell-culture revolution in 1950\u20131980 that attenuated viral vaccines really took off, together with the isolation and use of extracts and subunits of infectious agents. Pasteur's approaches of attenuation and inactivation still today provide the two poles of vaccine technology [29]. A chronology of important developments and achievements in vaccine research and implementation is shown in Figure 1\n. Recent developments in vaccine technology and application include combination vaccines, new adjuvants and delivery systems, reverse vaccinology and vaccines against noninfectious diseases.

The identification of potentially useful antigens is greatly facilitated by improved molecular biology techniques, such as microarray technology (discussed further below), but the elucidation of their full potential might rely on the development of effective delivery systems and adjuvants. Many adjuvants are based on microbial components but others, traditionally aluminium salts and more recently emulsions and surfactant based formulations, exploit different mechanisms of action. Particulate delivery can be mediated by polymer [often poli(lactide-co-glycolide)] microparticles, immunostimulatory complexes, liposomes and virosomes [31]. Possible advantages of particulate delivery are that antigen and coadjuvant can be delivered to the same cell and particulates have excellent potential for targeting cells of the immune system [32]. The extensive diversity of adjuvants and delivery systems is more comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [31, 32, 33, 34] and this review will, where appropriate, focus on the application and other aspects of this technology.",

The development of cell-culture technology that could replace the egg-based manufacturing process might facilitate faster production of much-higher antigen yields [4]. Live vaccines generally possess a natural adjuvant capability that is built on the evolved ability of our immune system to recognize many facets of potentially dangerous microbes and they have contributed immeasurably to the control of disease. Although some live vaccines might have undesirable characteristics, such as the mutation of polio virus and persistence of viruses such as varicella zoster virus, their use has been, and indeed remains, able to significantly reduce the impact of associated diseases [35, 36]. Viruses and bacteria as carriers of heterologous antigens and genes have received considerable attention over previous decades, and generation of auxotrophic mutants, as well as the use of other replication incompetent vectors and of reassortant viruses generated by the addition of RNA segments to viruses with segmented genomes, such as influenza and rotavirus, indicates the potential inherent in these efficient types of vaccine. In an interesting utilization of viral replication, a self-replicating RNA vector encoding a model antigen (\u03b2-gal), which was shown to protect mice against subsequent tumour challenge with colon carcinoma cells engineered to express \u03b2-gal, was also shown to effectively induce apoptosis in transduced cells [37]. The observed apoptosis also facilitated enhanced uptake by dendritic cells and was likely mediated by the presence of double-stranded RNA in replication of the virally derived genome. Double-stranded RNA is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) binding. Different TLRs recognize different surface and intracellular components of microorganisms. The interaction between a TLR and a microbial component triggers the activation of the innate immune system and the initiation of acquired immunity [38]. The elucidation of these pathways sheds light on mechanisms of adjuvant action and provides a basis for the inclusion of such potent agents and their analogues in vaccine design.",

It is thought that the poor ability of some specific antibodies to neutralize primary isolates is due, at least in part, to steric factors that limit antibody access to the gp120 epitopes [46]. Antibodies against the caveolin-1 binding domains are rare in many HIV infected individuals, possibly because of the presence of hypervariable immunodominant epitopes or the location and lack of exposure of conserved regions.

In terms of antigen identification, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) recently announced initiation of the Large-Scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery Program; utilizing complementary methods for epitope discovery, it is designed to identify immune epitopes from selected infectious agents and will make this information freely available to scientists worldwide through the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), currently under development [57].",

Mechanisms of adjuvant action have been elucidated, pattern recognition receptors including Toll-like receptors, NOD1, NOD2, scavenger receptors, mannose and other receptors are becoming increasingly well defined [38] and intracellular events related to these, such as activation of transcription factors and expression of inflammatory cytokines, shed further light on how these ligands and adjuvants that bind to pattern recognition receptors mediate their immunological actions. The ability of infectious agents to induce rapid, innate immune responses to molecular patterns provides the basis for adjuvant immunotherapy of cancers. Studies, such as the recent work examining the adjuvant activity of BCG cell-wall skeleton, peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide by the induction of genes in dendritic cells [58], will very possibly help to achieve definition of efficient effector output with minimal toxicity.",

In fact, rational design of vaccines represents a driving force born in the first revelations that components from or relating to a microbial pathogen can be used to protect against that disease and present throughout development of vaccines in the modern era, honing our understanding and preparing the way for the next steps in the battle to combat today's significant pathogens and diseases, such as cancer, HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.

The level of involvement of any of these factors depends on the aetiological agent of disease. For example, the level of protection required in a population (herd immunity) will be different and this could allow theoretical flexibility in vaccine efficacy. The application of molecular biology techniques can be crucial in the identification of new candidate antigens and subsequent determination of vaccine efficacy using adjuvants can feed knowledge back to correlates of protection in terms of immunological markers. This knowledge can then be used in choice of appropriate adjuvants and formulation. The key implication projected by this schematic is that for the greatest challenges in vaccine development the cyclical generation of knowledge provides a strong role for rational design. * Can be protective or therapeutic. ** Including reverse vaccinology and associated technologies.",

In both cases, the utilization of adjuvants capable of driving the required type of immune response can be used. This can be based on our current understanding of TLR interaction, and studies that manipulate this understanding might also serve to elucidate complex interactions during infection and disease. (a) According to recent models, antigen specific CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells,\u03b3\u03b4 T cells and CD1 restricted T cells, all participate in protection against M. tuberculosis infection in response to antigen presentation by macrophages (M\u03a6) and dendritic cells (DC), probably also involving crosspriming, where mycobacterial antigens are transferred from infected M\u03a6 to DC. It is unlikely that the induction of IFN-\u03b3 or the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase alone is enough to control TB infection, and evidence indicates that there might be another role for CD4+ T cells. The development of pre- and post-exposure vaccines will likely require antigens expressed by M. tuberculosis under pre- and post-exposure conditions, respectively. Interestingly, nonpolymorphic CD1 restricted T cells are thought to have evolved as a result of prolonged interaction with mycobacteria, indicating the extent of the impact of mycobacteria on its mammalian host. (b) For vaccines against HIV, it seems increasingly likely that strategies will depend upon highly conserved epitopes and on vaccine strategies that induce potent immune responses capable of driving cytotoxicity, as well as broadly reactive, highly effective neutralizing antibodies. Target antigens might very probably be different for each of these strategies. Figure adapted, with permission, from Ref. [32].",
