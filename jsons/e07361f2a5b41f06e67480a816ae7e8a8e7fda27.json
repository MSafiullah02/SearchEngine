The human placenta is a chimeric tissue that contains maternal and fetal components, which are organized so as to promote communication between the mother and fetus (Aplin 2000; Coyne 2016) .

The floating villi and anchoring villi are composed of trophoblasts (Benirschke and Kaufmann 2012 ). An individual chorionic villus has a polarized epithelium of cytotrophoblast progenitors (CTBs) anchored to a basal membrane. These cells possess high proliferative and migratory capacity, which allows them to leave the basal membrane and permits their differentiation into floating villi and anchoring villi. In the case of floating villi, the CTBs fuse to form a group of multinucleated cells known as syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs); these cells attach to fetal villous trees in the placenta, and the rest of the villi are in contact with the maternal circulation. The route leading to the assembly of the anchoring villi is formed by aggregates of differentiated CTBs, which organize into non-polarized mononuclear columns known as extravillous trophoblasts. EVTs have the capacity to attach and penetrate the uterine wall for forming a bridge between the mother and fetus. In the region between EVT columns and the endometrium, CTBs acquire an invasive phenotype for invading the maternal decidua and replacing the endothelial cells that constitute the uterine veins and arteries. The invasion of EVTs into the maternal decidua culminates with the formation of hybrid cells that allow fusion of maternal and fetal circulation (Fig. 1 ). This process defines placenta formation, which plays a very important role during gestation by promoting nurturing, protection and support in the uterine cavity (Cross, Werb and Fisher 1994; Norwitz, Schust and Fisher 2001; Maltepe, Bakardjiev and Fisher 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 256, "text": "(Benirschke and Kaufmann 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1688, "text": "(Cross, Werb and Fisher 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1721, "text": "Norwitz, Schust and Fisher 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1758, "text": "Maltepe, Bakardjiev and Fisher 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1487, "end": 1494, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "STRUCTURE OF THE MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE"}, {"text": "Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that recruit and employ different mechanisms to achieve the key events in the infection cycle and generate new infectious particles. During viral infection, one of the main challenges that viruses face is penetrating the target cell (Blaas 2016) . For this, the virus employs host cell surface molecules as receptors. This interaction between the virus and host cell induces conformational changes on viral proteins that promote viral entry into the host cell by two main mechanisms: (i) through direct fusion with the cell plasma membrane or (ii) through an internalization process within endosomes and further release into the cytoplasm (Schneider-Schaulies 2000; Yamauchi and Greber 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 290, "text": "(Blaas 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 711, "end": 736, "text": "Yamauchi and Greber 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ENTRY MECHANISMS OF VIRUSES INTO MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE TROPHOBLASTS"}, {"text": "Several groups have demonstrated the presence of specific receptors for different viruses on the plasma membrane of placental trophoblasts and choriocarcinoma cell lines such as BeWo, JAR and JEGIII (Halwachs-Baumann et al. 2006; Delorme-Axford, Sadovsky and Coyne 2013) . These cell line models maintain many of the structural and functional characteristics of trophoblasts and can therefore be widely used for studying viral infections occurring at the maternal-fetal interface (Vargas et al. 2012) . Pioneering studies with adenoviruses showed that trophoblasts express anchoring receptors that are necessary for the infection process (Koi et al. 2001) . The entry of adenoviruses into the target cell first requires interaction between the viral fiber protein and the coxsackievirus B (CBV) and adenovirus receptor (CAR); this is followed by interaction of the base of the viral protein penton Terry et al. (1986) ; Lazar et al. (2015) with the integrins \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 that are present in both differentiated and undifferentiated trophoblasts (Koi et al. 2001) . CAR expression varies with gestational age and the differentiation state of the trophoblast. This receptor is expressed only in villous trophoblasts and at very low levels in STBs in firsttrimester placentas. However, CARs are not expressed in TBs or STBs in third-trimester placentas; this receptor's expression remains constant in EVTs ( Fig. 2A) . These data suggest that the susceptibility to adenovirus infection depends on the stage of trophoblast differentiation (MacCalman et al. 1996) . The entry of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) into fibroblasts is mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); co-receptors-like integrins \u03b15\u03b23, \u03b12\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b21 are necessary for internalization of viral particles (Wang et al. 2003; Feire, Koss and Compton 2004) . Some of these receptors have been identified in CTBs; viral entry can be inhibited by blocking them with specific antibodies, which may help avoid the entry of HCMV into the placenta (Feire, Koss and Compton 2004) . Integrin receptors are differentially expressed in several types of trophoblasts, which suggests that susceptibility to HCMV infection in the placenta is related to change from an epithelial to endothelial phenotype ( Fig. 2A) .

Transcytosis is a type of transport that several cell types employ to mobilize molecules between two cellular compartments or environments. The movement of molecules may occur from the apical zone to the basolateral zone or vice versa; this will depend on the nature of the transported molecule and its impact on the cellular physiology (Tuma and Hubbard 2003) . Although transcytosis has been mainly studied in epithelial cells, this process is not restricted to this cell type; it has also been observed in osteoclasts, neurons and cells that constitute the human placenta (Coxon and Taylor 2008; Herve, Ghinea and Scherrmann 2008; Kzhyshkowska et al. 2008) . Both CTBs and STBs employ this mechanism for selective transport of a large amount of nutrients, hormones, growth factors and cytokines, as well as for the transfer of passive immunity to the foetus, since transcytosis is also utilized for the transport of maternal antibodies to the fetal circulation (Ellinger et al. 1999; Fuchs and Ellinger 2004) . The human placenta is formed by chorionic villi, which can be classified into floating villi and anchoring villi.

This strongly suggests that the cellular components of the placenta with specific differentiation states work as a barrier against HIV-1 infection.

This finding has been correlated with the fact that free HIV-1 viral particles cannot infect these cells. Therefore, it has been suggested that the infection process in trophoblasts occurs through primary infection of cells of hematopoietic origin (lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells), since it was observed that BeWo cells were infected when they were co-cultured with HIV-1-infected PBMCs and that this effect was not observed when the cells were incubated with free viral particles. Furthermore, infection of BeWo cells co-cultured with HIV-1-infected PBMCs was not observed when the cells were treated with transcytosis inhibitors, such as colchicine, supporting the importance of this transport mechanism during infection of trophoblasts by this virus (Parry et al. 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 189, "text": "(Parry et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 368, "end": 388, "text": "(Moussa et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 389, "end": 423, "text": "Sheikh, Polliotti and Miller 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1631, "text": "(Parry et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ENTRY MECHANISMS OF VIRUSES INTO MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE TROPHOBLASTS"}, {"text": "Additional studies have supported the role of transcytosis as an entry mechanism for HIV-1, since the virus employs a series of organized steps to access the trophoblasts by using this endocytic pathway. In particular, HIV-1 internalization in trophoblast cells may follow different routes: viruses can be degraded by lysosomes through the endosomal system; alternatively, viral particles may access the basolateral surface of trophoblast cells through transcytosis or may be transported by the recycling machinery to the apical surface of these cells. For viral entry, different cellular receptors are used. Viral fiber and penton protein of adenovirus interacts with CBV and CAR and integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25, respectively. HCMV entry is mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and co-receptors, like integrins \u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b12\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b21. CBV uses lipid rafts during the entry to the trophoblast and Src tyrosin kinase family plays a key role in this process. (B) Transcytosis as a viral access route. Internalization process of HIV particles employs early endosomes (EEA-1 positive) and accumulate in late endosomes (CD63 positive). The destination could be the degradative pathway or the fusion within the late endosome compartment and beginning of viral replication. Viral particles employ early endosomes that are positive for the protein early endosome antigen-1 (EEA-1) in order to obtain access into trophoblasts, suggesting that this process occurs rapidly or that few viral particles obtain access through this route. Additionally, HIV-1 particles accumulate in late endosomes, which are positive for CD63, and could be degraded through fusion to lysosomes or released into the cytoplasm to initiate the cycle of infection of trophoblasts. When these cells were treated with inhibitors of endosomal acidification, reduction in the expression of viral genes was observed, which suggests that viral particles utilizing this route may access the cytoplasm, promoting viral replication in these cells (Vidricaire, Imbeault and Tremblay 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2015, "end": 2055, "text": "(Vidricaire, Imbeault and Tremblay 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ENTRY MECHANISMS OF VIRUSES INTO MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE TROPHOBLASTS"}, {"text": "Viral particles are present in cellular compartments that specialize in cell recycling.

The observations obtained in this research determined key components of the access mechanism used by HIV-1 to enter trophoblasts, which is specific to these cells as this process occurs in a manner different from that in other cell lineages permissive to this virus (Vidricaire, Imbeault and Tremblay 2004; Vidricaire and Tremblay 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 801, "end": 841, "text": "(Vidricaire, Imbeault and Tremblay 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 842, "end": 871, "text": "Vidricaire and Tremblay 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 523, "end": 532, "text": "(Fig. 2B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "ENTRY MECHANISMS OF VIRUSES INTO MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE TROPHOBLASTS"}, {"text": "The use of transcytosis as an entry mechanism for access to trophoblasts has also been identified in other viruses, like the hepatitis B virus (HBV).

The viruses manipulate the host's mechanisms of cell death, which define the correct time for activating or stopping the cellular apoptotic machinery, thereby resulting in increase in viral replication or dissemination of viruses to new permissive cells (Danthi 2016) . Two pathways have been described for apoptosis induction in mammalian cells: the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway involves the activation of plasma membrane death receptors by extracellular signals (death ligands) that in turn induce the assembly of the death-inducing complex, eventually leading to caspase 8 and 10 activation. In contrast, the intrinsic pathway is activated through intracellular signals that act directly on the mitochondria, promoting a shift in its membrane permeability and the release of mitochondrial mediators that induce the assembly of a caspase-activating complex known as the apoptosome. The death-inducing complex and apoptosome induce the activation of effector caspases 3 and 7, which cleave substrates critical for promoting death (Galluzzi et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 671, "end": 684, "text": "(Danthi 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1475, "end": 1497, "text": "(Galluzzi et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MODULATION OF CELL APOPTOSIS DURING VIRAL INFECTION OF PLACENTAL CELLS"}, {"text": "Many of the viral agents that infect the maternal-fetal interface can either promote or inhibit the apoptotic mechanisms of their host cells.

HPV infection in the placenta could occur early during pregnancy. In some studies, placental tissues from gestational weeks 11 and 13 were recovered transabdominally to avoid contamination with HPV-infected cervical cells; however, viral DNA was still detected in these placenta samples (Weyn et al. 2011) . The presence of HPV in the cervix and placenta has been found to be associated with spontaneous abortion and spontaneous delivery (Amb\u00fchl et al. 2016 ). This may be explained by the fact that HPV-16 induces apoptosis in a first-trimester trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SV); Gomez et al. (2008) showed that trophoblasts transfected with a plasmid containing the HPV-16 genome had a higher apoptotic rate than those transfected with an empty plasmid. Furthermore, HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins promote cell death on transfection in trophoblasts, an effect that is more evident in the case of E7 (You et al. 2002) . The pro-apoptotic role of E7 has been linked to its interaction with retinoblastoma protein (Fig. 3) , which promotes the dissociation of retinoblastoma protein from the transcription factor E2F complex, in turn inducing the degradation of the protein through the proteasomal pathway and the activation of E2F to activate apoptosis (Barbosa et al. 1990; Boyer, Wazer and Band 1996) . In another study, the role of the E5, E6 and E7 oncoproteins was evaluated in BeWo cells transfected with these sequences (Boulenouar et al. 2010) . The oncoproteins had negative effects on growth and cellular adhesion and increased the migratory and invasive properties of trophoblasts. This phenomenon will be discussed in more detail in later sections. This study showed that the E5 oncoprotein had an important cytotoxic effect on the transfected BeWo cells because of its effects on cellular adhesion. Additionally, the toxic effect of E5 is promoted by its activity as a viroporin, a hydrophobic protein that oligomerizes in the host cell membrane to form a hydrophilic pore that can alter cell permeability (Nieto-Torres et al. 2015) . Keratinocytes transfected with the E5 sequence promote osmotic stress (Fig. 3) , resulting in apoptosis (Wetherill et al. 2012) . Further studies involving primary culture trophoblasts or choriocarcinoma cell lines are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying apoptosis induction by HPV-16 oncoproteins that could be associated with the induction of spontaneous abortions. induces DNA fragmentation and releases nucleosomal material in cytoplasm; the HPV-16 through oncoprotein E7 hijacks the RB protein and promotes its degradation by protesome. E5 oncoprotein of HPV, has function like viroporin these protein generates pores in membranes to result in stress osmotic and promoting the apoptosis process. NS1 protein of parvovirus activates the apoptosis by nuclear translocation of this protein and its association with DNA cellular and PARP protein.

There have been studies regarding this phenomenon in viruses that infect the maternal-fetal interface. In the trophoblast cell line JEG-3, HBV infection was found to induce early and late apoptosis in low percentages of cells (Fig. 3) , when analyzed with specific apoptotic markers, that is annexin V and DNA fragmentation, respectively (Bai et al. 2013) .

In addition, HBx protein could be involved in apoptosis inhibition through the Smad signaling pathway; when HTR-8 cells were transfected with HBx protein, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 (Fig. 3) , which are important regulators of proliferation and apoptosis, were upregulated (Cui et al. 2015) . The HBx protein is a promoter of proliferation in other cellular systems, for example, when oval cells were transfected with HBx plasmid, cyclin D1 overexpression was noted. The use of a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and MEK was found to inhibit AKT and ERK activation and decrease cyclin D1 proliferation and expression in HBx-transfected oval cells (Fig. 3) , suggesting the participation of this mechanism in the effect of HBx on proliferation (Wang et al. 2014 ).

Like DENV, this pathogen belongs to the Flavivirus genus. The high homology between the structural proteins of these two viruses, specifically the envelope protein, could be associated with ADE. Therefore, during infection with DENV, the immune response of the host can induce cross-reactive antibodies against other members of the genus, like ZIKV. Studies focusing on the serological cross-reactivity between these two pathogens have shown that DENV-reactive sera may promote ADE for ZIKV. This finding was first obtained in the human myeloid cell line U937, which is resistant to infection with DENV in the absence of ADE. In particular, U937 became permissive to ZIKV, when the virus was pre-incubated with a pool of convalescent sera for DENV. These results indicate the possibility that pre-existent immunity to DENV results in increased ZIKV replication, which could be related to the epidemics and pathological effects currently noted in the Americas (Dejnirattisai et al. 2016; Priyamvada et al. 2016) .

HCMV is one of the most studied pathogens in utero in this field of study. HCMV infection inhibits the proliferation and invasion of an EVT cell line (SGHPL-4), probably because of reduction in the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9, two key enzymes in the migration and invasion of EVTs (LaMarca et al. 2006) . Importantly, HCMV infection has also been studied in villous explants and EVT primary cultures obtained from women who tested negative for HCMV IgM in peripheral blood and who decided to interrupt their pregnancy during the first trimester (5 to 10 weeks) (Liu et al. 2011a,b) . In these models too, HCMV infection inhibited the invasive capacity of EVTs, which was associated with reduction of MMP-2, MMP-9 and c-erbB-2 protein levels and loss of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity (Liu et al. 2011a (Liu et al. ,b, 2015 . Liu et al. (2015) proposed that this effect could be due to an HCMV-mediated increase in the levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, a molecule that can inhibit the expression of both MMPs. Furthermore, they found that HCMV infection downregulates the expression of Smad-7, the main negative regulator of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, which could enhance the inhibitory effect on MMPs (Liu et al. 2015) . Other proposed mechanisms to explain the ability of HCMV to modulate the migration and invasion of trophoblasts contemplate its ability to alter the expression or functionality of receptors and signaling molecules that are important in the regulation of these processes, such as cytokines and their receptors. In particular, HMCV infection causes decrease in the protein levels of c-erbB-2, a common receptor of EVT related to invasion, and integrin \u03b11\u03b21, which participates in the invasion process (Fisher et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2011a Liu et al. ,b, 2015 . Furthermore, HCMV infection has been found to induce the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in primary EVTs and in a cell line derived from EVT (HIPEC), favoring the expression of key genes for viral replication (IE2) and significantly affecting the invasive capacity of these cells (Rauwel et al. 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 414, "end": 435, "text": "(LaMarca et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 694, "end": 714, "text": "(Liu et al. 2011a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 911, "end": 928, "text": "(Liu et al. 2011a", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 929, "end": 949, "text": "(Liu et al. ,b, 2015", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 952, "end": 969, "text": "Liu et al.

In addition, HCMV infection induces the production of other cytokines such as interleukin-10 in CTBs isolated from first-trimester placentas. In contrast, HCMV infection induces the production of other cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) in CTBs isolated from first-trimester placentas. CMV infection reduces the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in fibroblasts and vascular endothelium cell lines.
