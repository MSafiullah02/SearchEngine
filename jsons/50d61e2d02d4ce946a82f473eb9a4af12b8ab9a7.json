The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation.",

Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of \"Perceived Helplessness\", the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = .37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms.",

Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.",

The escalating global morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 has raised significant public health and economic concerns.

Previous studies of similar viral respiratory diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have shown that the infected patients present with varying degrees of mental health problems even after being discharged from hospital, indicating that the mental status of these individuals should not be ignored (Cheng et al., 2004; Mak et al., 2009 ).",

Compared with normal controls, patients with COVID-19 presented higher levels of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Though the total score of PSS-10 did not differ between patients and NCs, subgroup analysis demonstrated that female patients reported significantly more \"Perceived Helplessness\" than male patients and NCs. As for interactions between psychological distress and inflammatory biomarkers, the results revealed that depression levels were statistically directly related to the levels of Qiu et al., 2020) , and the healthcare workers (HCWs) (Lai et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b) . These studies consistently report that citizens of Wuhan or Hubei province were prone to higher levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms (Bo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) or psychological distress (Qiu et al., 2020) than other regions of China. Similar to our study, the nationwide on-line survey conducted by Qiu's group observed a gender effect on psychological outcomes (Qiu et al., 2020) , with females showing significantly higher psychological distress than males. Two other investigations focusing on HCWs found a comparable proportion of participants with symptoms of depression (50.4 percent), anxiety (44.6 percent) as in our data (Lai et al., 2020) . They also found that the general public and non-front-line nurses exhibited much higher vicarious traumatization than front-line nurses (Li et al., 2020b) . An initial report of 217 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, observed neurologic symptoms in nearly half of those with severe infection, with lower blood lymphocyte counts and elevated plasma CRP in patients with CNS-associated or muscular symptoms (Mao et al., 2020) . Notably, the elevated CRP levels or neutrophil counts combined with lower lymphocyte counts were considered to be prognostic of poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Our data demonstrated increased lymphocyte counts and decreased plasma CRP in the recovery phase of the illness. However, CRP levels in patients with DS were not significantly diminished, which may lead to mild neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as those associated with depression.",

Finally, qualitative analysis revealed that the main factors related to a patient's perception of stress of being diagnosed with COVID-19 were the unexpectedness of the illness, loss of control (uncertainty) and sense of powerlessness, and post-traumatic symptoms. The latter included avoiding stressful experiences, blaming others, and strong negative feelings of fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma is also an important issue among patients with COVID-19, as it may negatively affect their daily life in the community.Given the profoundly serious nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, it was not surprising that a significant proportion of patients studied experienced depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. Of note, is that in 2003, at the height the SARS outbreak, severe psychological outcomes were also observed in infected patients. A survey conducted in Hong Kong at that time showed that hospitalized patients with SARS reported increased stress and negative psychological effects by the measure of PSS-10(Chua et al., 2004), with a mean score of 20. Later, Cheng and the colleagues examined the psychological distress of SARS survivors, those who had been discharged from hospital, and found that about 35 percent of patients reported 'moderate to severe' or 'severe' ranges of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms(Cheng et al., 2004). Both studies included patients with the most severe type of SARS, with some admitted to ICU. Hence, our results may only be representative of patients who have less severe COVID-19 symptoms. A number of studies in China have investigated the mental status of COVID-19 patients(Bo et al., 2020), those COVID-19 negative",

In addition, the improvement on CRP concentration strongly correlated with levels of depression at the time of our observation. Although only cross-sectional psychological distress data was collected, the levels of depression seemed to be highly influenced by previous changes of inflammatory marker. This implies that the fluctuation of inflammation can dynamically influence the depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients. Previous research on patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV validate that the coronavirus might affect the central nervous system as it can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid(Arabi et al., 2015;Tsai et al., 2005). Recent evidence has confirmed that the COVID-19 is also neurotropic and possibly invades the brain though the olfactory tract in the early stages of infection. A significant number of COVID-19 patients report a sudden loss of smell or taste as an early symptom, which may indicate anosmia and dysgeusia caused by COVID-19(Giacomelli et al., 2020). Moreover, symptoms similar to intracranial infections such as headache, epilepsy, altered consciousness, and encephalitis among COVID-19 patients(Moriguchi et al., 2020)  highlight the acute neuropsychiatric symptoms due to the virus.",
