These observations suggest that baseline levels of leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may be important for orchestrating an effective early immune response. Hence, we performed \"in silico flow cytometry\" on 1,927 human lung tissues to deconvolute the levels of seven leukocyte types involved in triggering an acute anti-viral cellular immune response. Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting natural killer (NK) cells and activated NK cells are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses that include sex, age, race, body mass index and smoking history, and in two independent datasets. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, our results suggest that a subgroup of individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to COVID-19 due to concomitant high preexisting ACE2 expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung.",

It suggests that increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs may be accompanied by a poorer ability to mount a rapid innate immune response at early stages. This may predict long-term outcome of individuals infected with COVID-19, given that CD8+ T cell and NK cell counts in peripheral blood are low in COVID-19 patients [37] [38] [39] .
