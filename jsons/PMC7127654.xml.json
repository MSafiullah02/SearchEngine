IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 not only induces an antiviral state in cells by activating the expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) but also modulates the subsequent development of adaptive immunity (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004, Welsh et al., 2012). However, a number of viruses have evolved strategies to block the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 by interfering with the transcriptional and/or translational regulatory mechanisms (Lyles, 2000, Mibayashi et al., 2007, Ruggli et al., 2005). In most of the cases, the interference with the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction pathway contributes to the establishment of persistent virus infections in hosts (Haller et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a plus-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome length of approximately 15 kb. PRRSV infection is characterized by reproductive failure including abortion and stillborn piglets in infected pregnant sows and by acute respiratory disease in neonatal and young pigs. Approximately 10 million animals are infected with PRRSV each year in the US with the economic impact reaching 560 million dollars (Neumann et al., 2005). PRRSV primarily infects immune cells including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, which is believed to contribute to the immune suppression and viral persistence (Halbur et al., 1996, Suarez, 2000, Wang et al., 2007). PRRSV infections induce little or no IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in vivo and in vitro (Albina et al., 1998, Buddaert et al., 1998). Studies have further suggested that PRRSV not only failed to induce IFN-\u03b1, but also was capable of blocking the IFN-\u03b1 induction ability of other viruses such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) or dsRNA (Poly I:C) in vitro (Albina et al., 1998, Calzada-Nova et al., 2011, Miller et al., 2004). Overall, the existing evidence clearly suggests that PRRSV may have intrinsic properties to inhibit or reduce the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Several recent studies have shown the role of nonstructural proteins of PRRSV, especially Nsp1\u03b1 and Nsp1\u03b2, in antagonizing the transcriptional activation of IFN-\u03b2 in vitro (Beura et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2010, Song et al., 2010), but their relevance to the natural host cells such as macrophages and Mo-DC remains unknown. Here, we intended to explore the mechanisms by which PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in its natural host cells, porcine Mo-DC.",

The results showed that PRRSV induced a comparable amount of IFN-\u03b1 transcripts as Poly I:C treatment in Mo-DC (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, PRRSV activated the transcription of IFN-\u03b1 in a time dependent manner. The transcription of IFN-\u03b1 started to increase at 12 h after infection and reached the highest level at 24 h after infection, which is about 12 h delayed compared to poly I:C treatment. The transcription of IFN-\u03b1 in Poly I:C treated cells increased at 4 h after treatment and reached the highest level at 12 h after treatment, then started to decline (Fig. 1A). As expected, Pam3CSk4 treatment down-regulated the transcription of IFN-\u03b1, suggesting that TLR1/2 activation possibly suppresses the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction pathway (Fig. 1A).",

We have also shown that inhibition of PI3K/Akt by a PI3K specific inhibitor reduced PRRSV replication in Mo-DC (Zhang and Wang, 2010). Since some previous studies have suggested the possible role of PI3K/Akt activation in mediating the IFN-\u03b1 induction in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Guiducci et al., 2008), it is reasonable to speculate that PRRSV may activate the IFN-\u03b1 transcription in a PI3K-dependent manner. We sought to determine whether PI3K/Akt activation actually contributes to the activated transcription of IFN-\u03b1 by PRRSV. We infected Mo-DC with PRRSV in the presence of DMSO or LY294002, a PI3K specific inhibitor. At 4, 12, 24, 48 h after virus infection, cells were harvested for real-time RT-PCR. Supernatants were collected for IFN-\u03b1 ELISA. We found that treatment of Mo-DC with a PI3K inhibitor prior to PRRSV infection dramatically reduced the transcription of IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 1A). This suggests that PRRSV activates the transcription of IFN-\u03b1 in a PI3K dependent manner in Mo-DC.",

            "text": "Numerous previous studies have consistently shown that PRRSV is a poor inducer of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 both in vitro and in vivo (Albina et al., 1998, Buddaert et al., 1998, Calzada-Nova et al., 2011). However, the exact mechanism by which PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 remains elusive, especially in porcine susceptible cells such as alveolar macrophages and Mo-DC. Although several recent studies have suggested the role of nonstructural proteins of PRRSV, especially Nsp1\u03b1 and Nsp1\u03b2 in antagonizing the promoter activity of IFN-\u03b2 in MARC-145 and human cell culture systems (Beura et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2010, Song et al., 2010), their relevance to the PRRSV naturally susceptible porcine cells remains uncertain. More intriguingly, a couple previous studies have clearly demonstrated that PRRSV activated the transcription of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo as evidenced by the increased mRNA molecules detected by real-time RT-PCR (Chung et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2004). A similar observation was reported for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Rose and Weiss, 2009). Although the nucleocapsid protein and two nonstructural proteins (nsp1 and nsp3) of MHV have been reported to antagonize the IFN promoter activity, IFN is induced in primary cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages. Here, we have observed that PRRSV efficiently activated the transcription of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in porcine Mo-DC. Abundant and a comparable level of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 transcripts was induced by PRRSV and Poly I:C in Mo-DC. However, PRRSV blocked the induction of IFN-\u03b1 in Mo-DC by as yet undefined post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. This agrees with the conclusions of the study on porcine alveolar macrophages by Lee et al. (Lee et al., 2004). Our results are contradictory to an earlier study, which showed that neither Poly I:C nor PRRSV activated the transcription of IFN-\u03b1 in Mo-DC at 12 and 24 h after treatment (Loving et al., 2007). Our results also support the conclusion that virus replication is essential to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction by PRRSV as reported by Albina et al. (Albina et al., 1998), but contradictory to the results of a more recent study which showed that virus replication is not necessary to the suppressive activity of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction by PRRSV (Calzada-Nova et al., 2011) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We have further demonstrated that the increased transcription of IFN-\u03b1 is mainly mediated by the activation of PI3K by PRRSV since the use of a PI3K specific inhibitor prior to PRRSV infection significantly reduced the transcripts of IFN-\u03b1 upon PRRSV infection. This is in agreement with the previous study showing the critical role of PI3K mediated IRF-7 in the induction IFN-\u03b1 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells by CpG ODN (a TLR9 ligand) and influenza A virus (a TLR7 ligand) (Guiducci et al., 2008). Our previous study has suggested that PRRSV activated the PI3K/Akt pathway during early infection to facilitate virus replication process. Here, we have further shown the positive correlation between PI3K activation and increased transcription of IFN-\u03b1. It seems that the PI3K/Akt pathway may be important in both virus's survival and replication and host's innate defense mechanism, suggesting a delicately controlled balance between virus's offense and host's defense mechanisms. A very similar role of PI3K/Akt in both virus replication and host defense has been suggested previously for influenza A virus (Ehrhardt et al., 2006).",

Future studies will be focused on delineating the exact post-transcriptional mechanisms utilized by PRRSV to block the induction of IFN-\u03b1 in infected Mo-DC and alveolar macrophages.",
