It can develop occasionally following thoracic surgery, infection, medical intervention, or malignancy. Bronchopleural fi stula is seen in 2-3 % of postpneumonectomy cases. 200 mL is necessary to obliterate the lateral costophrenic angle. 5 Subpulmonic pleural effusion ( SPE ) is a pleural effusion that occurs below the lungs at the diaphragmatic surface. SPE does not obliterate the costophrenic angle, but it distorts the shape of the diaphragmatic dome, giving the impression of raised hemidiaphragm. You can suspect SPE in the left lung when the space between the gastric bubble and the lower lung margins increases up to 3 cm instead of usual few millimeters. Beside the raised hemidiaphragm, the lung appears to end early on PA radiographs (. Fig. 7 .1.2 ). 5 Encysted ( loculated ) pleural effusion is a localized encysted fluid at the fissures between lobes of the lung. It occurs usually at the right lung's minor fissure, and it has biconvex contour mimicking a mass (. Fig. 7.1.3 ) . Very rarely, a benign form of mesothelioma can grow along the major or minor fissures mimicking encysted pleural effusion, a condition known as pseudotumor . 5 Parapneumonic effusion is an effusion that develops adjacent to pneumonias (empyema). Almost 30 % of patients with pneumonia develop pleural effusion and usually resolve with antibiotic therapy. 5 Mediastinal pleural effusion is a fluid collection around the mediastinum. It is an unusual condition, and when it occurs, it forms silhouette sign along the mediastinal borders causing mediastinal widening. Silhouette sign is a term used to describe any opacity within the chest radiograph that obliterates a mediastinal border.",

Chemical pneumonitis is a pulmonary edema that occurs due to inhalation of noxious chemical substance such as ammonia, smoking inhalation, near-drowning situations, and gastric acid aspiration. Th e mechanism of pulmonary edema is the result of one of the three mechanisms: irritation of the tracheobronchial tree that leads to infl ammation and pulmonary edema formation; absorption of the noxious material from the respiratory tract, which can aff ect the lungs directly by its metabolites; and asphyxiation due to inhalation of high concentration of the noxious material that will displace oxygen from the blood and cause tissue hypoxia. Druginduced and transfusion reactions pulmonary edema arise due to anaphylactic lupus-like reaction formation. Th e radiographic picture cannot be differentiated from ARDS unless you have history of drug ingestion or recent transfusion reaction. Classic examples of drugs causing pulmonary edema are heroin, aspirin, and penicillin.

MRSA causes metastatic foci of infections in 30 % of cases into the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart valves, and joints. Most communityassociated MRSA strains carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, which is rarely found in the hospital-acquired MRSA or the normal strain of S. aureus . PVL toxin is a potent lethal factor to neutrophils, which causes tissue necrosis and severe necrotizing pneumonia. MRSA pneumonia is more frequently associated with sepsis, high-grade fever, hemoptysis, pleural eff usion, and death compared to PVL-negative S. aureus . MRSA pneumonia can result in the formation of pulmonary cavitary infi ltration due to the development of necrotizing pneumonia. Th e development of MRSA necrotizing pneumonia should be suspected in a young patient presenting with hypoxia, hemoptysis, and single or multiple cavitary lung lesions.

Sarcoidosis belongs to a large family of granulomatous disorders, which includes tuberculosis, leprosy, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and more. All members of the granulomatous disease are characterized by the formation of granulomas within the body system. Granuloma is a specifi c kind of chronic infl ammation, and it is a term used to describe a nodular chronic infl ammation that occurs in foci (granules), with collection of macrophages called epithelioid cells. Epithelioid cells are macrophages with abundant cytoplasm that is similar to the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. When multiple epithelioid cells fuse together, they form a bigger macrophage known as giant cell . Epithelioid cells defi ne granulomatous infl ammation. On histological specimens, granulomas show endarteritis obliterans, fi brosis, and chronic infl ammatory cells (epithelioid cells). Granuloma can be due to an infection (e.g., tuberculosis) or due to an inorganic foreign body (e.g., silicosis).",

Up to 30-50 % of patients suff er from exocrine dysfunction, fat malabsorption, and glucose intolerance.

Intussusception occurs in 1 % of CF patients and is typically seen between the ages 4 and 10 years.

As a result, prolonged obstruction occurs only during sleep. b. The magnitude of the negative intraairway pressure : this negative force is generated by contraction of the diaphragm and is related to the total airway resistance. Narrowing of the nasopharyngeal airway increases total airway resistance and requires additional negative intra-airway pressure to maintain fl ow. c.

UARS is defi ned as intermittent attacks of sleep apnea associated with snoring and respiratory disturbance index (RDI) less than 5 with daytime sleepiness attacks. Unlike OSAS, UARS is characterized by the absence of frank sleep apneas or oxygen desaturation with daytime hypersomnolence.UARS patients are typically nonobese (in contrast to OSAS) and have a mean age of 37 years and body mass index <25 kg/m presenting with snoring and daytime hypersomnolence. UARS arises due to retrolingual narrowing, low soft palates, long uvulas, and high, narrow hard palates as determined by cephalometry.OSAS patients are typically obese (BMI >30) and have RDI >5 and daytime sleepiness (hypersomnolence). In contrast, primary snoring is defi ned as snoring at night, RDI <5, and no daytime sleepiness.",

Central alveolar apnea syndrome, also known as Ondine's curse, is a disease characterized by failure of the automatic control of ventilation during sleep due to a lesion aff ecting the descending anterolateral medullocervical pathway of the reticular formation.Ondine's curse is a mythological fairytale about a mermaid who exchanged into a human to marry the man she loves. She made an excellent wife; however, her husband cheated on her with another woman. Ondine was still retaining part of her magic power as a mermaid, so she cursed her husband with a curse that whenever he falls asleep, he suff ocates. So he has to be awake forever; otherwise, he will die.Ondine's curse can be congenital or acquired. Congenital Ondine's curse may be associated with Hirschsprung's disease ( known as Haddad syndrome ) or neuroblastoma. Th e disease arises due to mutation in the PHOX2B gene.Neonates with Ondine's curse syndrome presents typically with hypotonia and apnea that needs continuous ventilation hours aft er birth. Th e pathological process is related to insensitivity to hypercarbia with raised serum pCO 2 levels ( may be up to 80 -90 mmHg ), especially during sleep, when the respiration is maximally under chemical control. Acquired Ondine's curse is an uncommon condition that arises in adults and has been reported in association with medullary tumors, infection ( particularly poliomyelitis ), upper cervical trauma with Duret hemorrhage, some mitochondrial diseases, degenerative diseases (e.g., multiple system atrophy ), medullary capillary telangiectasias, demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis ), or nonspecifi c anoxic-ischemic insults. Diaphragmatic pacing has been described in series, with reported success rates between 50 and 70 %. Candidates for diaphragmatic pacing must be severely incapacitated by chronic ventilatory insuffi ciency and are usually receiving ventilatory support before pacing is instituted..
