            "text": "Approximately 20,000-30,000 measles patients were reported in a surveillance of infectious diseases because of low vaccine coverage of 80% in Japan. Among them, some were thought to be secondary vaccine failure (SVF) with generally mild or non-typical measles illness and sometimes became a source of further transmission. We have developed a new, sensitive, and rapid method to detect the measles virus genome by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). We examined 50 nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples that were obtained during the 1999 outbreak and stored at \u00c0708C and fresh NPS, lymphocytes and sera from 11 patients in 2003. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RT-LAMP. We detected the genomic RNA corresponding to at least 0.01-0.04 TCID50, 30-100 copies in samples by RT-LAMP within 60 min after extraction of RNA, and all four genotypes isolated in Japan were equally amplified. Specific DNA amplification was monitored spectrophotometrically by real time turbidimeter and the quantity of RNA was calculated. Measles virus genome was detected in 44 of 50 stored NPS by RT-PCR and in 49 by RT-LAMP. The vaccine strain was discriminated from wild strains after sequencing the LAMP products. RT-LAMP is a useful rapid diagnostic method for the detection of measles virus without any special apparatus, showing higher sensitivity than RT-PCR, and expected to be applied for hospital-based infection control and for laboratory-based measles surveillance.",

            "text": "Measles virus is a single stranded negative sense RNA virus, belonging to the genus Morbillivirus, family Paramyxoviridae, order Mononegavirales. It consists of 15,894 nucleotides, coding six structural proteins; nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), membrane (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin (H), and large (L) proteins [Griffin et al., 2001] . Two glycoproteins of F and H are components of outer surface envelope proteins and cooperatively play an important role in the initial attachment of virus to the cells and following virus-cell fusion [Wild et al., 1991; Griffin et al., 2001] . Genome RNA is surrounded by N, P, and L proteins and they comprise the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) [Griffin et al., 2001] . Measles virus is considered to have monotypic characteristics but genetic variation has been described for the wild types. The standardized nomenclature for describing the genetic characteristics of wild-type measles virus isolates is demonstrated using 8 clades, designated A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, with 22 genotypes [WHO, 2001] . The differentiation of measles virus genotypes is based on the sequence results of the most variable region of 500 nucleotides at the 3 0 end of the N gene or full-length H gene. In our previous reports [Nakayama et al., 1995; Yamaguchi, 1997; Takahashi et al., 2000] , the measles virus strains isolated in Japan since 1984 were classified into four different genotypes, C1 (before 1985) , D3 (1985-1990) , D5 (after 1990) , Chicago-type D3 (1997 Chicago-type D3 ( -1999 , and H1 genotype (after 2000) .",

            "text": "The diagnosis of virus infection is traditionally performed by virus isolation and serological examinations, but these methods are time-consuming and not appropriate for clinical setting. In some virus laboratories, molecular-based diagnostic methods, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and hybridization were employed. Recently, real time RT-PCR has been developed, showing its rapidity and quantitative features [Ozoemena et al., 2004; Schalk et al., 2004] . Approximately 100-280 copies of the measles virus genome were detected [Ozoemena et al., 2004; Schalk et al., 2004] , but it is not appropriate as a rapid diagnostic tool for clinical use because it requires a specific apparatus. A more sensitive and specific method for DNA amplification method, loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), was developed by one of the authors [Notomi et al., 2000] . This method employed Bst DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six different sequences in the target DNA. The key reaction is the construction of a 5 0 and 3 0 end loop dumb-bell structure and multibranched stem-loop products are amplified through repetition of the reactions. The distinctive features of LAMP are rapidity, high sensitivity, high specificity, and simplicity; these are required for the rapid diagnosis. We developed this new method for the detection of the measles virus genome by real-time reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) targeting the measles N gene and compared its sensitivity with nested RT-PCR reported previously [Nakayama et al., 1995; Zhou et al., 2003] . [Nakayama et al., 1995; Yamaguchi, 1997; Takahashi et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2003] . To examine the sensitivity of RT-LAMP, we used 50 nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples stored at \u00c0708C obtained from natural measles and fresh samples were obtained from 11 patients; 8 were suspected as having SVF and 3 had vaccine-associated illness.",

The principle of primer design is shown in Figure 1A and the LAMP primer is targeted for the N region similar to the RT-PCR region from the genome position 1242 to 1442 (Fig. 1B) . We synthesized six LAMP primers recognizing eight different regions, referred to the software program for LAMP primer design (Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); two outer primers (F3 and B3), two inner primers, a forward inner primer (FIP) and a backward inner primer (BIP), and two loop primers (Loop F and Loop B), and primer sequences are shown in Figure 1C . The FIP contains the complementary alignment of F1 linked with the F2 sequence (F1C \u00fe F2), and BIP contains the complementary sequence of B1 sequence linked with the B2 (B1C \u00fe B2). Basically, these four primers amplified the target DNA and we synthesized two additional loop primers F and B located between F1 and F2, and between B1 and B2, respectively. The addition of two loop primers enhances the specificity and reactivity [Nagamine et al., 2002] . For the LAMP reaction, the mixture was made up to a total of 25 ml of reaction mixture, containing 40 pmol (each) of FIP and BIP, 5 pmol (each) of F3 and B3, 20 pmol (each) of Loop F and Loop B, 1.4 mM each dNTPs, 0.8M betaine, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 8 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1% Tween 20, 1 U AMV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs), 8U Bst DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and 5 ml of sample RNA. The reaction mixture was subjected to real-time turbidimeter LA200 (TERAMECS, Kyoto, Japan) [Mori et al., 2004] and the LAMP reaction was carried out at 638C for 60 min. The turbidity was scanned every 6 sec.",

The reverse transcription process produces two kinds of structures; RNA-cDNA complex from F3 to B3 portion and single strand cDNA primed by FIP primer in Figure 2 (3). This cDNA forms 5 0 end loop structure. BIP primer anneals to 3 0 end of cDNA and extends DNA synthesis in Figure 2 (3)(4). B3 primer attaches the B3 portion and detaches the double strand DNA in Figure 2 (5). Thereafter, double strand DNA and dumb-bell loop structure of single strand DNA are produced in Figure 2 (6)(7). This dumb-bell loop structure is basic product for further extension of LAMP reaction and FIP primer binds to the 3 0 end of single strand loop region in Figure 2(7) .

A recent development in the molecular approach was applied for a clinical diagnostic tool. We reported the use of nested RT-PCR for the detection of the measles virus genome, and it showed a high sensitivity and specificity [Nakayama et al., 1995; Afzal et al., 2003] . RT-PCR procedures established at various laboratories have differed in sensitivity by as much as 1,000-fold [Afzal et al., 2003] . Recently, several authors have reported real-time RT-PCR, which has the additional advantage of being a quantitative method, but this method was not appropriate for rapid bedside diagnosis [Ozoemena et al., 2004; Schalk et al., 2004] . Ozoemena et al. [2004] reported that the nested PCR method proved to be 10 to 100 times more sensitive than TaqMan PCR method, but they preferred TaqMan RT-PCR because of its advantages of contamination control, automation, and real time quantitative features. The sensitivity of the system depends on the selection of primers and probe alignments [Ozoemena et al., 2004] .",

LAMP has been applied for the detection of many kinds of infectious agents, mainly for the DNA virus of human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 and 7, varicellazoster virus (VZV), or the bacterial genome [Iwamoto et al., 2003; Kuboki et al., 2003; Maruyama et al., 2003; Ihira et al., 2004; Okamoto et al., 2004; Yoshikawa et al., 2004] . Yoshikawa et al. [2004] reported that the VZV genome was amplified with a detection limit of 500 copies by LAMP. Recently, RT-LAMP method was reported for the detection of West Nile virus , SARS corona virus [Thai et al., 2004] , and mumps virus [Okafuji et al., 2005] . SARS coronavirus was detected with high sensitivity of 0.01 pfu detection limit by RT-LAMP and 100-fold higher sensitivity of nested RT-PCR system. We developed RT-LAMP for the detection of the measles virus genome and compared the sensitivity of RT-LAMP with that of RT-PCR for the detection of measles virus. Measles RT-LAMP had 10-fold higher sensitivity than nested RT-PCR and the detection limit was approximately 0.01 TCID 50, 30-100 copies, similar to SARS RT-LAMP system. The measles virus genome was detected in 49 of 50 stored samples by RT-LAMP but in 44 by nested RT-PCR. It was also efficiently amplified from clinical samples of NPS, PMBC, and sera. Genotypes A, C1, D3, D5, and H1 were amplified without any differences in the detection limits. We could not examine all 22 genotypes. From the results of sequence alignments in Figure 5 , several mutations were observed in eight primer regions and some were located at the 3 0 end of each primer. It might influence the sensitivity of RT-LAMP, but we could deal with it by minor-modification of primers. RT-LAMP procedure is simple operation in a single tube and time-saving and we can obtain the results within 1 hr after the extraction of the virus genome. LAMP method for the detection of the genome of pathogenic agents is a useful tool in hospital-based rapid diagnosis. We calculated the quantity of genome in the sample by monitoring the spectrophotometric value and there was a linear correlation between the genome quantity and reaction time to reach the threshold. The quantitative RT-LAMP will contribute much to the better understanding about the different pathophysiology of virus infection [Okafuji et al., 2005 ].",
