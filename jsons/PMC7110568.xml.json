The phylogeny also revealed that there was little difference among the Brazilian, European and USA circulating influenza B viruses since they all clustered together with no particular geographic pattern. A slight temporal structure can be observed in the tree, with viruses sampled in September and October clustering together, and samples from November and December 2017 clustered together to viruses sampled in 2018 (from other countries).

Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated that viruses of the B/Victoria lineage infect subjects at a relatively younger age than those of the B/Yamagata lineage.29, 30 As both INF B lineages have been circulating since 2001, and it is widely recognized that the QIV vaccine offers better protection than the TIV,19 it sounds paradoxical that to date there is no recommendation of preferential use of QIV over TIV.",
