One important research question, confined at present to animal and in vitro modeling [1\u20133], is the extent of interferon (IFN) responses in the control of viremia early after infection onset. Implementation of WNV nucleic acid-amplification testing (NAT) of US blood donors allowed us to identify individuals who were in the earliest stages of infection at the time of their donation [4]. To define the kinetics of viral replication and IFN-mediated host responses to WNV infection during the earliest stages of viremia, we longitudinally analyzed viral loads (VLs), serological data, and plasma cytokine and chemokine levels in infected blood donors before and after seroconversion during the acute phase of infection.",

The first follow-up specimen was obtained 1\u20139 days after the index donation, and the second follow-up specimen was obtained 6\u201319 days after the index donation. ELISA revealed that the index and first follow-up specimens from 3 of 31 viremic donors were weakly reactive to anti-WNV IgG antibody, despite nonreactive WNV IgM results (table 1). Index donations in the remaining 28 donors were not reactive to anti-WNV IgG antibody, and IgG followed IgM seroconversion with increasing ELISA signal-to-cutoff ratios. IgG seroconversion was further evaluated by PRNT for donors whose index specimens were reactive to anti-WNV IgG antibody. This analysis demonstrated detectable levels of WNV-neutralizing antibodies that coincided with the second IgM-reactive follow-up specimen. Neutralizing antibodies for a related arthropod-borne virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, were undetectable in 2 of 3 donors whose index donation tested positive for anti-WNV IgG antibody. For the third such donor, the first follow-up sample had neutralizing antibodies to St. Louis encephalitis virus but no neutralizing antibodies to WNV. In the second follow-up specimen from this donor, neutralizing antibodies to WNV (titer, 1:2560) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (titer, 1:5120) were present (table 1).",

The donors in this study exhibited significant up-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 during the acute viremic phase (i.e., before IgM seroconversion) and after IgM seroconversion, compared with median plasma levels in IFN-\u03b3 in control specimens (table 2 and figure 1B). Also, IFN-\u03b1 levels in donor specimens were higher than those in control specimens only before IgM seroconversion, which is indicative of an early period of IFN-mediated proinflammation and antiviral host immunity. The similar expression patterns of up-regulated TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in infected blood donors was not surprising, given their linkage as proinflammatory mediators and roles in the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis [3, 9\u201311]. Concomitant increases of IL-4 in plasma samples obtained before and after IgM seroconversion was unexpected because humoral immune responses in specimens obtained before IgM seroconversion are not detectable by commercial serology kits (figure 1B). IL-4 has recently been associated with immunogenic responses in a WNV subunit vaccine study [12]. IL-4 may therefore function in an immunoregulatory role during acute infection, to counterbalance proinflammatory T cell-mediated immune responses and support early humoral adaptive immunity. Indeed, blood donors in this study were in the earliest stages of WNV infection and appeared otherwise healthy at the time of donation.",

            "text": "In figure 1C, median plasma levels of CXCL10 and CCL2, both stimulated by IFNs, were strikingly increased before IgM seroconversion, compared with controls; levels of both chemokines decreased after IgM seroconversion. We did not observe a similar decrease in CXCL9 levels following IgM seroconversion, although CXCL10 and CXCL9 share the same receptor (CXCR3). Disparate regulation of CXCL10 and CXCL9 has been noted in studies of herpes simplex virus type 1 and the agent of SARS, suggesting that CXCL10 and CXCL9 play nonredundant roles in acute viral infection [13, 14]. CXCL10 is a potent chemoattractant for activated Th1 lymphocytes (adaptive immunity) and natural killer cells (innate immunity), whereas CCL2 is a monocyte and basophile chemoattractant (innate immunity). Therefore, CXCL10 and CCL2 are important host response mediators, with CXCL10 in particular thought to play a role in the temporal development of innate and adaptive immunity in concert with IFNs. In murine models of WNV infection, CXCL10 has been shown to play a neuroprotective role [15]; however, recent results have argued that early CXCL10 expression (preceding IFN-\u03b3) and other chemokines may trigger inflammation and neuropathological conditions [9]. Our study suggests a role for CXCL10 in the control of early acute WNV viremia. The temporal and site-specific relationships between persistent CXCL10 expression and neuropathological outcomes during infection remain to be determined.",
