In addition, there has been a lack of understanding of how these microorganisms evolve to escape host immune responses, or conversely insufficient insight into the characteristics of protective immunity exemplified by the failure of HIV vaccines [2]. At the forefront of this conundrum are infections caused by RNA viruses, which are the most common pathogens of humans and animals, and largely have no effective vaccines available. These viruses include the high-profile epidemic pathogens, such as HIV-1, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Dengue virus, as well as endemic viruses that particularly cause morbidity and mortality among infants and aged individuals, such as norovirus and enteroviruses. In addition, emergent RNA viral pathogens are a major concern, typified by swine flu (influenza A H1N1), which arose via genetic recombination and then crossed species barriers to become pandemic in 2009 [3].",

            "text": "Since 2005, the development of high throughput, or so-called NGS technologies, has allowed a massive increase in capacity to sequence genomes at a relatively low cost and in a short time frame. NGS refers to a collection of high-throughput sequencing technologies developed since 2005, which use amplification-based assays to sequence in parallel many genomes from individual templates [4] (Box 1\n). The current NGS technologies are known as second generation technologies (Box 1, Table I), to differentiate them from the first generation (Sanger sequencing), and the third generation \u2013 which is based on single molecule sequencing [5].Box 1NGSCurrent NGS technologies that are dominating the market are known as second generation sequencing technologies, to separate them from the first generation of sequencing assays based on the Sanger method. The techniques involved in NGS include template preparation, sequencing and imaging, and data analysis (see Box 3 and [4] for detailed review). The combination of specific protocols for these techniques distinguishes one available technology from another.Template preparation involves randomly breaking the DNA of interest into small fragments, which are then attached to a support such as beads in suspension, or a solid interface. Spatially separated immobilization of these template sites allows thousands to billions of sequencing reactions to be performed simultaneously in a process consisting of successive incorporation, washing and scanning operations to capture the sequence data. Second generation techniques are typically based on obtaining sequences from clonally amplified templates, whereas third generation techniques use single molecules with multiple nucleotide or probe additions [5] \u2013 both options generate technical errors.Commercially available NGS technologies differ in the coverage, read length and specific chemical technologies used to sequence and read the generated strands (Table I\n). For instance, Roche 454 Titanium technology has moderate coverage (or capacity) (\u223c1Gb per run), but has an average read length of 450 nucleotides (nt) and a maximum of \u223c800 nt. By contrast, Illumina or SoliD technologies have a much higher coverage (\u223c20\u201350 Gb per run), but an average read length of <15 nt. Most of the technologies also offer the possibility of paired reads \u2013 a mechanism to link two separate reads across the genome. This is improving the quality and applicability of NGS (Table II\n).The most commonly used NGS technologies at present are: (i) amplification of DNA material via pyrosequencing (Roche 454); (ii) reversible dye-termination sequencing (Illumina); and (iii) sequencing by ligation (SOLiD). This field is rapidly expanding, and novel improved platforms are continuously being developed and released. Examples include Heliscope by Helicos (http://www.helicosbio.com/), Ion Torrent Life Technologies (http://www.iontorrent.com/) and a real-time sequencing platform by Pacific Biosciences (http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/). Third generation techniques, based on sequencing of a single molecule of DNA or RNA, without intermediate steps between reading two segments are rapidly emerging [5].",

            "text": "The first breakthrough in the application of NGS to vaccinology was sequencing the full genome of organisms and their hosts within hours to days at moderate costs. Since 2008, when the first whole human genome sequence was completed [6], at least 30 human genomes have been completed via NGS, and more will be available with the ongoing 1000 Genome Project [12]. Similarly, the large genomes of many pathogens, including DNA viruses, bacteria and parasites have been sequenced, and new pathogens identified via metagenomics [13], such as a new Bunyavirus sequenced from patients with unexplained fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia [14]. A key advantage provided by NGS in genomics is the capacity to detect low-frequency variants [15], which are important elements in both genetic and infectious diseases research [16] (see \u2018NGS to study rapidly mutating viruses\u2019 below). NGS analyses have also revealed complex scenarios, with somatic gene rearrangements in host tissues or cells being far more common than expected, and copy number variations accounting for more variation between individuals than the many recognized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [12]. As a remarkable example, a comprehensive whole genome analysis revealed a catastrophic event \u2013 termed chromotripsis \u2013 occurring in at least 2\u20133% of all human cancers, whereby tens to hundreds of somatic genomic rearrangements occur with many genomic segments from distinct chromosomes reassembled in random order into a derivative chromosome [17]\n.Box 3Technical review of data analysis approachesAnalysis of NGS data generally requires a pipeline of bioinformatics tools, which serve a variety of purposes, including technical error correction, quality control of the data output, and ad hoc analyses relevant to specific NGS applications (e.g., variant detection, transcriptome analyses, and epigenetics). Generally, the pipeline for NGS analysis firstly includes quality control of the NGS reads by both manual and automated checking of quality scores of sequence reads; and other filtering, including elimination of the ends of individual reads which frequently carry systematic errors. After quality control, NGS reads can be aligned to a reference genome (when available), or aligned in a de novo approach (albeit with clear consequences in terms of increased complexity and analysis time). A collection of alignment tools are available \u2013 mostly public domain with many wiki pages and web sites constantly updated with the new and existing tools (e.g., see http://SEQanswers.com/). The alignment step is followed by specific data analysis for the application in consideration. Tools are also available to handle the large NGS data files and to allow for exchange in format, which facilitates the bioinformatics analyses as well as the exchange of information (e.g., samtools http://samtools.sourceforge.net/samtools.shtml). Several recent reviews have summarized currently available tools for sequence alignment [16], SNP calling [59], and transcriptomic analyses [16].Pushed by one of the most compelling limitations of NGS, the short read length \u2013 new advanced bioinformatics tools have been developed to reconstruct long sequence haplotypes from short NGS reads. These approaches utilize advanced statistics (Bayesian and clustering algorithms), to reassemble haplotypes and estimate their frequency of occurrence in the sequence population [55]. This analysis has particular relevance to vaccine development, as variants within the pathogen population may carry sets of mutations that allow escape from host immunity, or an increase in virulence. Recent applications of NGS also allow pooling of different genomes, and analysis of genetic variants from hundreds of individuals in a single run, thereby removing a key limitation of traditional molecular genotyping with laborious and costly assays [9].",

Recently, NGS has been used to characterize temporal changes in gene expression, at both host and pathogen level, during an infection (Table 1\n). Other NGS studies have focused on noncoding RNAs. For example, microRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large family of small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate mRNAs, and thereby influence gene expression programs and hence fundamental cellular processes, with growing evidence of relevance to human disease [22]. To date, over 5000 miRNAs have been identified, including approximately 800 human miRNAs. During some viral infections, such as with herpesviruses and adenoviruses, the virus and host cell mutually cross-regulate gene expression via miRNAs [23] (see Table 1 for further examples).",

However, there are at least three key issues for resolution in wide-scale application of NGS to vaccine research. First, the quality of NGS data must be improved by resolution of technical errors [4] (see Box 2). This may extend the current spectrum of NGS applications to the detection of more complex genetic rearrangements, such as insertion, deletion and recombination events in rapidly mutating pathogen genomes [55]. Second, in an era when vaccine research is increasingly acquiring a systems biology approach, NGS in combination with large scale and high-throughput technologies to study proteomes, such as mass spectrometry, flow cytometry (and combinations of these, such as mass cytometry that allows simultaneous measurement of >30 parameters from a single cell [56]), will provide a simultaneous, rapid, and low cost flow of integrated information on genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of both host and pathogen. In this scenario, computational analyses will need to be integrated into the workflow; not simply in analysis of the data, but rather as in integrated component of the study design. Finally, future developments in NGS will bring forward new challenges. For instance, single molecule third generation sequencing will probably remove the constraint of short reads, but will introduce other obstacles, such as new technical errors and challenges in experimental design.",

Sequence analyses of one subject (designated 240_Ch) who ultimately developed chronic infection, revealed that the viral population found in the acute phase of the infection (aquamarine and blue, see Time legend) became markedly reduced in diversity around 100 days post-infection, before a new viral population emerged from variants that survived the genetic bottleneck event (reduction in genetic diversity) replacing the single founder virus and its progeny. Colors are also used to portray the sampling time point (see legend). This new genetically distinct viral population (gray and red in the color legend) dominated the chronic phase of infection. The size of the circles represents the prevalence of the individual variant within the viral population.
