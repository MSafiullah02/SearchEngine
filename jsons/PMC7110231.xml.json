Compared with the adamantanes, the 2 licensed NA inhibitors\u2014zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014are associated with little toxicity and are less prone to select for resistant viruses [3]. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistance after oseltamivir treatment has been reported ([4] and references therein). Furthermore, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses are now circulating on all major continents [5]. Although at present these viruses are susceptible to zanamivir, the resulting increased use of zanamivir monotherapy may well lead to the development of resistance [6]",

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are attractive biologic drugs given their exquisite specificity and low toxicity. The development of mAbs for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza has been inhibited by the lack of candidates with broad neutralizing activity resulting from the virus\u2019s tolerance for genetic changes in its immunodominant epitopes. However, a recently discovered class of mAbs that are able to neutralize an unprecedented spectrum of influenza virus subtypes by binding to a highly conserved region of the membrane-proximal stem of the viral hemagglutinin holds promise as a future intervention for both seasonal and pandemic influenza [7, 8]",

All animals that received CR6261 survived challenge with both viruses without showing any signs of disease, except for a decline in body weight of \u223c9% during the first 3 days after challenge with A/WSN/33 (Figure 1E). In contrast, all control animals rapidly showed signs of disease, lost weight, and either died of the infection or were euthanized within 2 weeks after either challenge. All but one of the oseltamivir-treated mice survived challenge with A/HongKong/156/97 (Figure 1A). However, in contrast to the CR6261-treated mice, these animals lost weight comparable to the control group until 11 days after infection, when they started to regain weight (P<.001) (Figure 1B). Furthermore, all oseltamivir-treated mice showed signs of illness beginning on day 5 after infection and started to recover on day 15 (Figure 1C). Similarly, treatment with oseltamivir prevented death but not weight loss and signs of disease on challenge with A/WSN/33. Mice treated with oseltamivir lost weight similarly to the control group during the first 10 days after challenge, after which they started to regain weight (Figure 1E), and this loss was greater than that of the group treated with CR6261 (P<.001). Signs of disease were observed in individual animals between days 2 and 19 after challenge, and median clinical scores differed significantly from those of the CR6261-treated group between days 2 and 17 (P\u2a7d.032) (Figure 1F). The alternating median clinical scores (between 2 and 3) of this group is likely explained by subjectivity in the assessment of clinical scores by different observers. Taken together, these data indicate that prophylactic administration of a single intravenous injection with 15 mg/kg CR6261 is more effective against lethal H5N1 and H1N1 challenge than a 5-day course of treatment with oseltamivir at 10 mg/kg/day",

These encouraging results in these highly stringent models justify further preclinical evaluation of CR6261 as alternative strategy for the control of influenza. The 15 mg/kg dose of CR6261 used in this study was based on previous experiments in mice [8], but further studies are needed to assess the minimal plasma concentrations of this mAb necessary for effective prophylaxis and treatment. A 5-day course of treatment with oseltamivir at 5 mg/kg/day has previously been shown to be protective against lethal challenge of mice with A/WSN/33 [11], whereas treatments with doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day (and even 0.1 mg/kg/day) have been shown to protect mice against lethal challenge with A/HongKong/156/97 [12, 13]. In these latter studies, oseltamivir was administered in a twice-a-day regimen, whereas we used a once-a-day regimen. However, when comparing the efficacy of 1 daily administration of 10 mg/kg oseltamivir with that of 2 daily administrations of 5 mg/kg against lethal A/HongKong/156/97 infection, we found no difference (data not shown). This result is in line with previously reported data showing no significant difference in the efficacy of oseltamivir at 5 mg/kg/day against lethal A/WSN/33 infection of mice when given as a single dose or in 2 doses 12 h apart [11]",

            "text": "Although therapeutic administration of CR6261 completely prevented death due to A/HongKong/156/97, it only partially prevented mortality due to A/WSN/33. This difference is likely explained by the fact that onset of disease and progression to death were more rapid after challenge with the latter virus. The median clinical scores at the moment of antibody administration (4 days after challenge) were 1 and 3 for the groups of mice challenged with A/HongKong/156 and A/WSN/33, respectively. Accordingly, the median survival time in the control group challenged with A/WSN/33 was shorter than that in the control group challenged with A/HongKong/156/97 (7 vs 10 days; P=.003). However, the fact that administration of CR6261 to mice that had already lost 24.1% of their initial body weight and that showed severe respiratory distress still partially prevented death demonstrates the fast mode of action. This feature, combined with the relatively long half-life (2\u20133 weeks) in humans of mAbs produced in PER.C6 cells [14], make human mAb\u2013based passive immunotherapy a viable option for both treatment and prophylaxis of disease due to influenza virus infection, provided that comparable efficacies can be obtained in humans with economically feasible doses of antibody",
