On the coastline, the rainy season begins in April and ends in November. The central and southern regions have an equatorial climate with moderate rainfall between March and June and intense precipitation between September and November. In the northern part of the country, the rainy season occurs between May and September. The lowest temperatures (21\u00b0C) are recorded in the west, while the highest (32\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C) are recorded in the north.

The sentinel sites were private (7 sites) and public (7 sites) primary healthcare centers. At each sentinel site, trained nurses or physicians identified all ILI cases presenting at the clinics from Monday through Sunday. The surveillance staff consisted of facility staff who worked on the surveillance program on a voluntary basis. An ILI case was defined as an outpatient presenting with sudden onset of fever (temperature >38\u00b0C) and cough or sore throat, with the onset of symptoms within the prior 5 days. All individuals with ILI were considered eligible for enrollment. Subjects were enrolled on a daily basis. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all identified cases who were \u226518 years of age. For case patients aged <18 years, proxy informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians. Patients who did not meet the case definition or did not provide verbal consent were excluded from the study.\n",

The products of multiplex RT-PCR methods 1\u20133 were subjected to heminested multiplex RT-PCR, as described previously [9].

Multiplex method 4 was developed for the simultaneous detection of the 4 HCoVs, using primers described by Vabret et al [10].

In other studies in the developed and developing worlds, however, respiratory viruses were detected in <50% of cases [2, 4, 11, 13\u201316]. These differences could be due to true differences in overall burden, to differences in study populations, or to the use of different diagnostic techniques.

The rate of detection of RSV in our study (5.7%) was lower than rates reported by other investigators. For example, in a study performed in Madagascar [7, 17], 21.2% of samples from patients with ILI were positive for RSV. The low proportion of RSV-positive samples in our study could be because we did not include hospitalized children, as RSV has been shown to be a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children admitted to the hospital [2, 14]. The detection rate for HCoV (5.3%), PIVs (7.5%), and HMPV (5.0%) was in agreement with data from other studies [16, 18\u201321].",

This is consistent with our finding of a higher circulation of influenza virus during June\u2013July and October\u2013November 2009, corresponding to the rainy season in most of the areas where our sentinel sites are located. However, the seasonality of influenza virus in Cameroon in 2009 contrasts our earlier study that showed that A(H1N1) was the prevalent influenza A virus subtype circulating in the country in 2008 and that it had no marked seasonality [8]. This highlights the need for multiple years of influenza surveillance to properly define the temporal patterns of influenza virus circulation, especially in tropical areas, where less demarcated seasonal patterns are observed.",

HRV circulated year-round, a finding shown in other studies [7, 12, 15]. Increased HRV circulation coincided with a period of decreased activity for influenza virus, a situation also observed in Madagascar [7]. In our study, HRV was the most frequent virus detected in children <5 years of age (25.6%). This finding contrasts with other studies conducted in Senegal [6] and China [11], where the predominant virus detected in children <5 years of age was RSV. This difference could be due to different inclusion criteria for the study subjects. We included mostly children with upper respiratory tract infection; the studies conducted in Senegal and China also included children with lower respiratory tract infection.

First, we did not test for some respiratory DNA viruses (adenovirus and bocavirus), and we did not test for any respiratory bacteria. Adenovirus has been shown to be responsible for up to 13% of acute respiratory tract infections [18, 20]. As such, our results may underestimate the overall frequency of respiratory viral infections among ILI patients in Cameroon. Second, although our findings suggest considerable circulation of respiratory viruses in the country, we are limited in our ability to fully assess the burden of these viral agents: because our focus was on patients with ILI who presented at selected outpatient clinics, we lack data on the contribution of the investigated viruses to cases of pneumonia resulting in hospitalization. Third, the involvement of facility staff on a voluntary basis, with frequent shifts in personnel to other facilities, resulted in the poor performance of sentinel sites in some regions. This, coupled with the narrow interval of our study (1 year), hindered our ability to implement region-specific analysis to assess spatiotemporal variations in virus circulation in relation to climatic and geographic factors.",
