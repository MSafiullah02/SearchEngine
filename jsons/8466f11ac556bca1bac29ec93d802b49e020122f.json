            "text": "Bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis is caused by Clostridium perfringens and leads to sudden death. Alpha toxin, together with perfringolysin O, has been identified as the principal toxin involved in the pathogenesis. We assessed the potential of alpha toxin as a vaccine antigen. Using an intestinal loop model in calves, we investigated the protection afforded by antisera raised against native alpha toxin or its non-toxic C-terminal fragment against C. perfringensinduced intestinal necrosis. Immunization of calves with either of the vaccine preparations induced a strong antibody response. The resulting antisera were able to neutralize the alpha toxin activity and the C. perfringens-induced endothelial cytotoxicity in vitro. The antisera raised against the native toxin had a stronger neutralizing activity than those against the C-terminal fragment. However, antibodies against alpha toxin alone were not sufficient to completely neutralize the C. perfringens-induced necrosis in the intestinal loop model. The development of a multivalent vaccine combining the C-terminal fragment of alpha toxin with other C. perfringens virulence factors might be necessary for complete protection against bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis.",

It secretes several toxins and enzymes that cause different forms of tissue damage [1] [2] [3] . Consequently, it can cause a variety of diseases in various vertebrates [2] . The differences in virulence properties between C. perfringens isolates are largely due to differences in toxin production. Alpha toxin and perfringolysin O have been identified as the principal toxins involved in gas gangrene caused by C. perfringens as well as in bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis [4] . Gas gangrene is a frequently lethal histotoxic infection of humans and animals characterized by rapid tissue destruction and impaired immune response [5, 6] . Bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis (bovine enterotoxaemia) is an enteric disease of veal calves and beef type suckling calves and is characterized by hemorrhagic to necrotizing enteritis. Calves often die without premonitory signs [4, [7] [8] [9] .",

Although both alpha toxin and perfringolysin O are involved in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene, immunization against alpha toxin alone provides good protection against experimental gas gangrene [6, 10, 11] . Moreover, Evans showed that antiserum raised against alpha toxin was highly effective in protecting guinea pigs against experimental gas gangrene, whereas antiserum to perfringolysin O was not protective against C. perfringens type A infection, and it did not enhance the protective action of alpha toxin antiserum [12] . Studies on gas gangrene cannot be directly extrapolated to bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis, but these findings indicate that alpha toxin vaccines could provide protection against diseases in which alpha toxin is critically important.",

The number of loops injected with each strain is shown in Table 2 . In each calf, an equal number of control loops were injected with sterile bacterial growth medium supplemented with milk replacer. The experiments were performed according to a published protocol using seven healthy male Holstein-Friesian veal calves aged 3-5 months [19] . Briefly, the calves were anesthetized and the small intestine was exteriorized. The loops were ligated and injected with logarithmic phase cultures combined with 25% commercial milk replacer (Vitaspray, Nuscience Drongen, Belgium) in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution, as described [19] . The animals were kept under anesthesia for 5 hours after inoculation, after which they were euthanized and samples were taken.

The forward primer (5\u2032-G TGA GAG GAG GAT ATA AAA ATG AAA AGA AAG ATT TGT AAG GCG -3\u2032) contained an in-frame stop codon and translation re-initiation sequence to remove the N-terminal leader and allow native protein expression.

            "text": "Alpha toxin is involved in the induction of necrotic lesions in a calf intestinal loop model and is thus an important toxin in the pathogenesis of enterotoxaemia. We previously showed that alpha toxin production by C. perfringens is required for intestinal virulence by using a double-mutant C. perfringens strain devoid of alpha toxin and perfringolysin O, which was complemented for perfringolysin O to generate an alpha toxin-deficient phenotype [4] . In the present study, we supported our earlier conclusions by using an alpha toxin-mutant strain. Mutant strains are frequently used to evaluate the Intestinal loops inoculated with sterile cell culture medium (n = 29), the wild-type strain (n = 29), the alpha toxin-deficient strain (\u0394plc) (n = 29), the alpha toxin deficient strain carrying the empty shuttle vector [\u0394plc (shuttle vector)] (n = 10) and the alpha toxin-complemented strain (n = 10) were histologically examined for the presence of tissue necrosis. The graph represents the percentage of loops in which necrotic lesions were present after 5 h of incubation with logarithmic stage cultures. ** 0.001 \u2264 P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 indicate a significant difference relative to the loops inoculated with the wild-type strain. virulence effect of C. perfringens genes. A mutant strain was used to show that NetB is crucial for the induction of avian necrotic enteritis [24] . This approach also identified beta toxin as an essential virulence factor of C. perfringens type C in infected rabbits [25] . Moreover, Awad et al. used mutant strains to demonstrate that both alpha toxin and perfringolysin O are involved in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene [17, 26] . In our study, we confirmed that alpha toxin is required for intestinal virulence in a calf intestinal loop model. This conclusion was based on genetic evidence showing that an alpha toxin-deficient strain has a decreased ability to cause necrotic lesions in this model. The alpha toxin-complemented strain regained the ability to cause the disease, unambiguously fulfilling Falkow's molecular Koch's postulates [27] .",

Antisera raised against native alpha toxin reduced the lesion-inducing potential of C. perfringens in the intestinal loop model. However, alpha toxin is a potent dermonecrotic toxin that is not safe for use in calves. Alpha toxin can be rendered safe by formaldehyde treatment, but a well-known problem of this treatment is that it might reduce immunogenicity [5, [28] [29] [30] . Therefore, a recombinant C. perfringens alpha toxoid may be preferable to a formaldehyde toxoid. The immunogenicity of the C-terminal fragment of alpha toxin in calves was recently reported for the first time [31] . However, the ability of the antiserum derived after vaccination of calves with Cpa 247-370 to neutralize the toxicity of C. perfringens to bovine cells or bovine intestine has not been evaluated [31] . Here, we report that the non-toxic C-terminal domain of alpha toxin (Cpa 247-370 ) may be an effective alternative to the use of native alpha toxin. Indeed, calves immunized with the native alpha toxin or with the C-terminal domain of alpha toxin developed a strong immune response against alpha toxin. Nevertheless, compared to antisera against the native alpha toxin, sera from calves immunized with the C-terminal fragment of alpha toxin showed weaker inhibition of the alpha toxin activity and weaker neutralization of the C. perfringens-induced endothelial cytotoxicity in vitro. Additionally, the lesion-inducing potential of C. perfringens in the intestinal loop model was significantly reduced only by co-administration of antisera from animals vaccinated with the native alpha toxin.",

            "text": "The diminished protection afforded by antisera against the C-terminal domain may be attributed to the GST tag fused to the C-terminal domain of alpha toxin for protein purification purposes. Distortion of the conformation of the alpha toxin fragment by the GST tag has already been suggested in a previous study reporting that the untagged fragment was more protective against experimental gas gangrene than the C-terminal fragment fused to the GST tag [13] . In contrast to the C-terminal fragment of alpha toxin, the recombinant native alpha toxin used in this study was fused to a HIS tag for purification. This HIS tag is substantially smaller than the GST tag and is less likely to influence the conformation of the alpha toxin. This construct might generate more antibodies against the conformational epitopes that are important for protection. Alternatively, it may be that, in addition to antibodies directed to the C-terminal fragment of alpha toxin, also antibodies against the N-terminal fragment are needed to provide protection. However, a previous study showed that immunization with the N-terminal domain of alpha toxin was not protective against experimental gas gangrene [13] . It is believed that membrane binding induces a conformational change in the N-terminal domain from the closed to open configuration, which could reduce the affinity of antibodies raised against the N-terminal domain and complicates the development of protective antibodies against this N-terminal region [32, 33] . Moreover, the combination of both toxin domains as vaccine antigen is not straightforward because combination of both non-toxic fragments restores the biological activity of alpha toxin [34] . Total protection was not obtained even after vaccination with native alpha toxin. It is possible that not all alpha toxin was neutralized by the antisera, leaving residual active alpha toxin to exert cytotoxicity. We also do not know whether in the field serum antibodies leaking into the intestinal lumen after intestinal damage will be sufficient to inhibit alpha toxin and the induction of necrotic lesions. This should be tested in a subsequent study by performing intestinal loop experiments in immunized animals without adding antiserum to the ligated intestinal loops. It is possible that total protection against development of intestinal lesions also requires other neutralizing antibodies, for example, against perfringolysin O and/or other C. perfringens proteins. Therefore, other C. perfringens proteins in addition to alpha toxin and perfringolysin O might have to be incorporated in a vaccine to obtain complete protection. This is also the case for avian necrotic enteritis, where NetB is essential to cause disease, but vaccination with NetB provides only partial protection against C. perfringens challenge [35] [36] [37] .",
