However, personalized medicine is impossible without a personalized diagnosis that considers all the possible causes of a person\u2019s disease. Traditional molecular diagnostic methods, such as PCR and qPCR, cannot provide the necessary information to practice personalized medicine, because they cannot be multiplexed, allowing the detection of only one or a few (no more than 3) targets at a time in one sample. Practicing personalized medicine, therefore, requires multiplex PCR (mPCR), which can evaluate many molecular targets at once, in one reaction, from one sample.",

            "text": "It is clear that MDDs are needed, but in order to make the assays practical, we want them to have the following advanced features:\n\nMultiplex capabilities. The definition of multiplexing is \u201creceiving multiple signals from the same source.\u201d For MDDs, multiplexing refers to the ability to conduct multiple genotyping tests at the same time and within the same sample. We want multiplexing because it requires only small amounts of precious patient sample; it allows the clinician to run fewer tests, while acquiring more relevant information; it reduces the amount of reagents, consumables, and time involved; and, most importantly, it can save lives. For infectious disease MDDs, we want a multiplex test that can identify all pathogens related to a clinical syndrome or detect all the genes and mutations responsible for the drug-resistance phenotype.\nSpecificity. Even though multiple microorganisms are studied simultaneously, we want only the pathogens associated with the infection to be identified and with a high level of confidence.\nSensitivity. We want an MDD to be able to identify a pathogen or drug resistance directly from a patient sample rather than from an enrichment culture. Using the patient sample directly eliminates the time required for bacterial or viral culture preparation and enzymatic testing. However, in order to bypass this propagation step, the assay must be sensitive enough to detect only a small amount of pathogen material in the patient sample.\nReliability. For clinical application of MDDs, a consistent performance from assay to assay and from lot to lot is required.\nSpeed. For an MDD to be practical for infectious disease diagnosis and treatment, it must be locally available and produce results within a few hours.\nAutomation. An MDD should not require a PhD scientist: it should be user-friendly, and no special training should be required to perform the assay. The MDD system should also be easily integrated into standard molecular laboratory practice and should be automatable.\nClosed system. A challenge to widespread use of MDD is the risk of template or amplicon contamination of the work environment, which may lead to false positives. One advantage of qPCR is that the specific detection step is carried out inside the PCR tube, in real time, without the need to reopen the tube. To make MDD practical, it must be carried out in a closed system.\nAffordability. MDDs should be cost-effective.\n",

There are many publications that claim multiplex PCR applications, but here we consider true multiplexing to be the detection of 5 or more targets in one reaction. The following is a list of common challenges associated with multiplexing.\n\nIncompatible loci. Each target in a multiplex PCR requires its own optimal conditions, and these may be incompatible between targets; therefore, increasing the number of multiplex targets makes finding satisfactory common conditions difficult and, in many instances, impossible.\nLack of specificity. Multiple sets of high-concentration primers in a system often generate primer dimers or nonspecific background. Lack of specificity also adds operational burdens by requiring post-PCR cleanup and multiple posthybridization washes, which make automation very difficult.\nLack of sensitivity. Crowded primers reduce amplification efficiency and waste resources by occupying enzymes and consuming substrates.\nUneven amplification. Differences in amplification efficiency may lead to large discrepancies in amplicon yield. In a multiplex system, some loci may amplify very well, while others may amplify poorly or even fail to amplify. Uneven amplification makes it impossible to accurately perform end-point quantitative analysis.\nLot-to-lot variation. Because large amounts of primers are consumed in each reaction, and manufacturers can generate only a limited number of assays per lot, quality control and quality assurance can be difficult. The resulting poor repeatability makes it very difficult to gain FDA approval and therefore restricts large-scale use of the technology.\n",

Some of these gene-specific primers have tag sequences that can be recognized by a universal set of primers, called SuperPrimers\u2122, which are included in the same reaction system together with the gene-specific nested primers. Only the SuperPrimers are included at a concentration necessary for exponential amplification, and only the reverse SuperPrimer is labeled.

When the number of multiplex targets increases, it forces all primer sets to work under a single amplification profile; therefore, multiplex PCR is nearly impossible under standard conditions. With tem-PCR, there are two sets of nested primers for each target in the enrichment stage. This design gives rise to four possible forward and reverse primer combinations for amplification. Each combination may have its own optimal amplification profile, but given four amplification opportunities, a common condition that satisfies all targets can be attained.",

Reduced amplification efficiency can also occur when primers occupy active sites on the polymerase. In addition, unused labeled primers produce background signal and use up reagents during the detection part of the assay. Because of these issues, post-PCR cleanup (such as spin column purification) is often required to remove these labeled primers before they can be used as probes. Yet, high-concentration primers are only required in the last cycles of a PCR reaction. With tem-PCR, the amounts of gene-specific primers used is only enough to enrich the targets and incorporate the SuperPrimer tag into the PCR products. After enrichment and tag incorporation, amplification is carried out with only one pair of primers. Because only one pair of primers is labeled, the background is low; therefore, no post-PCR cleanup is required. The PCR reaction is also very specific and sensitive, and no posthybridization washes are necessary.

Signal is further enhanced by exonuclease digestion to remove mis-priming products or genomic DNA. The selected amplicons are protected from digestion by a 3\u2032 modification of the universal primer. The selected amplicons are then amplified together by PCR with the universal primers.

It is sometimes believed that, with the advance of high throughput sequencing technology and the accompanying rapid price drop, PCR will soon become an outdated technology and will no longer be needed. This is not true. Because sequencing is only a detection technology, it cannot increase the signal-to-noise ratio, which is critical in infectious disease diagnosis. For example, in bloodstream infections, peripheral blood samples from patients may have only 20 copies of the bacterial genome per milliliter of blood, but will have millions copies of the host genome. At that low signal-to-noise ratio, false positive rates will be extremely high and unacceptable for clinical applications. High-throughput sequencing will be useful in infectious disease diagnosis only if the signal-to-noise ratio can be increased significantly, and that requires mPCR.",

The xMAP method for collecting and reporting data also contributes to repeatability. Typically, there are 5,000 beads added per reaction for each color-coded bead set. Each bead set is specific for a particular disease marker, such as a mutation or a pathogen. The laser counts 100 microspheres from each bead set and reports the median fluorescent intensity (MFI).

However, without mPCR, scientists usually study only one gene segment at a time. This is a problem because, for a particular bacterial strain, drug resistance capability may come from many different genes and mutations.

Many studies have shown that active surveillance, plus patient isolation, is one of the most effective methods to reduce HAIs [15]. Regularly scheduled surveys of critical environments (such as the ICU), instruments, and healthcare providers will raise the level of awareness and identify problems early. When an outbreak of HAI occurs, MDDs can quickly identify the source of an infection, helping healthcare providers determine which patients should be isolated to prevent the spread of the microorganisms. In an increasing number of states, hospitals are required to publish their rate of HAI, which is calculated based on discharge records. However, some patients may be misclassified as having an HAI because they were asymptomatic carriers before being admitted to the hospital. MDDs can help hospitals better identify, control, and report HAIs, thereby lessening their liability. As a result, MDDs can help reduce costs, shorten hospital stays, and improve the quality of care, while protecting profits.",

Depending on how you measure it, the healthcare industry represents between 15 and 16 % of the gross domestic product. Traditionally, these financial activities occurred in three subcategories: providers (such as hospitals, nursing homes, and diagnostic laboratories), payers (such as insurance companies), and life sciences (such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals). For example, the cost of developing a new drug can be as high as $800 million [17]. That cost is passed on from the life science sector to the payers and then to the providers.
