Wuhan was the epicenter of COVID-19 since Dec. 2019 [5], [6], [7]. The other 5 cities are representative in that they are situated in the three most important economic zones in China, which contribute more than 40% of the national GDP. Specifically, Beijing and Tianjin are representing the Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) Metropolitan Region in Northern China. Hangzhou and Suzhou are the major players in the Yangtze River Delta City Cluster in Eastern China. Shenzhen is the flagship in the Greater Bay Area in Southern China. Another important reason to select these cities for our study is that the population of these cities contains a large number of migrant workers and college students from other cities or provinces. The frequent human mobility largely increases the risk of imported cases, posing great challenges to the control and prevention of COVID-19, especially when people are gradually returning to workplaces and schools in a later stage.",

            "text": "The underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations are difficult to characterize because they are complex and related to various observations and disease-related factors, including the number of confirmed cases, the potential risks brought by unconfirmed cases, the distribution of different case categories (indigenous/imported) in different regions/cities, the population distribution of different age-groups, the social contact patterns in different settings (e.g., households, schools, workplaces, and public places), the extent of interventions implemented in different regions/cities, etc.. To address this challenging issue in a fundamental way, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people [20,21]. Specifically, we examine the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. To characterize the age-specific social contact-based transmission, we divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university and college students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). The population in each of the seven groups has its own specific social circles, gathering places, or activity patterns. Meanwhile, we consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households, which may lead to the transmission within families; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities, which may cause the spread among students and teachers; (3) various physical workplaces, which may affect in-office and outside workers; and (4) public places and communities, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours, where the spread within a dense population may arise.",

The appropriateness of using such a computational method for social-contact estimation in data-scarce situations has been validated20: the estimated C\nH, C\nS, C\nW, and C\nP are consistent with the results from a real-world social contact survey [22] in terms of the strong assortativeness and the appearance of similar secondary diagonal contact patterns.",

According to Xia et al.\u2019s work [21], the initial weights of four social contact matrices in our study are set as: rH=0.31,rS=0.24,rW=0.16,rP=0.29. It should be pointed out that similar settings have also been utilized to simulate the contact matrices in other studies, e.g., the similar weight for the household matrix has been used to calculate the contact matrix for Varicella and Parvovirus B19 [23]. The results in Figure 3 show that our model with the above parameter settings can adequately capture the disease trends in different cities; our sensitivity analysis also confirms that the developed model (to be described below) is relatively robust to the parameter settings.",

            "text": "With the overall age-specific social contact matrix C, we can characterize the disease transmission pattern using the next-generation matrix K\nt\n[24]:(4)Kt=(\u03bc\u03b3)StBCA,It+1=KtIt,where S\nt, B, A, and K\nt are 7 \u00d7 7 matrices and I\nt is a 7 \u00d7 1 vector. Specifically, S\nt, B, and A are diagonal matrices, with the diagonal elements siit, bii, and aii (i = 1, \u2026, 7) being the size of susceptible population in Gi at the t-th generation of the disease infection, the individual susceptibility in Gi, and the infectivity of infected individuals in Gi, respectively. The i-th element in vector I\nt denotes the number of infectious individuals in Gi at the t-th generation of the disease infection. By referring to Li et al.\u2019s work [6], we set the reproduction number R\n0 = 2.2. For the recovery rate \u03b3, we calculate it as follows: First, according to the definition of recovery rate [25], it is the reciprocal of the duration of being infectious (i.e., \u03b3 = 1/infectious period). Then, according to Svensson's work [26], the infectious period is equal to the mean generation time minus the mean latent period, so we have \u03b3 = 1/(mean generation time - mean latent period). Further, as pointed out in Binti Hamzah et al.\u2019s work [27] and Liu et al.\u2019s work [28], the mean generation time is 7.5 days. Moreover, Wu et al.\u2019s work [7] indicates that the mean incubation period is 5.2 days for COVID-19. As there is not precise infection date for those patients to estimate the mean latent period, we use the mean incubation period to approximate the mean latent period. Therefore, the recovery rate is estimated as \u03b3 = 1/(7.5-5.2). For the infectivity, we set aii = 1.0 (for i = 1, \u2026, 7) according to Xia et al.\u2019s work [21]. For the susceptibility bii, as it represents the probability of being infected when a susceptible individual is exposed to infectious contacts, we estimate it as follows: For each Gi, we first calculate its infected population ratio ri by dividing the number of infected cases in Gi by Pi, i.e., ri = ni/Pi. With ri calculated for all 7 age-groups, we then obtain a multiplier, 1/min{r\n1, \u2026, r\n7}, through normalizing the smallest ri to 1, and inflate all other infected population ratios by 1/min{r\n1, \u2026, r\n7}. Then we estimate the susceptibility as bii = ri/min{r\n1, \u2026, r\n7}. As different cities have different numbers of infected cases and different population sizes, they will have different susceptibilities. Specifically, we have: b\n11 = 1.00, b\n22 = 1.23, b\n33 = 35.33, b\n44 = 21.09, b\n55 = 13.18, b\n66 = 42.16, and b\n77 = 97.48 for Wuhan; b\n11 = 9.08, b\n22 = 1.00, b\n33 = 10.67, b\n44 = 4.15, b\n55 = 10.26, b\n66 = 14.58, and b\n77 = 17.90 for Beijing; b\n11 = 1.00, b\n22 = 1.86, b\n33 = 1.66, b\n44 = 3.14, b\n55 = 5.24, b\n66 = 9.86, and b\n77 = 11.94 for Tianjin; b\n11 = 1.06, b\n22 = 1.87, b\n33 = 1.00, b\n44 = 1.78, b\n55 = 5.46, b\n66 = 9.38, and b\n77 = 4.51 for Hangzhou; b\n11 = 1.07, b\n22 = 1.18, b\n33 = 1.57, b\n44 = 1.00, b\n55 = 3.97, b\n66 = 7.20, and b\n77 = 3.14 for Suzhou; and b\n11 = 3.57, b\n22 = 4.72, b\n33 = 1.00, b\n44 = 2.76, b\n55 = 3.49, b\n66 = 17.59, and b\n77 = 32.51 for Shenzhen.",

To take the effect of intervention into consideration, it is important for us to further decrease rH, rS, rW, rP in Eq. (3), i.e., the weights of different social contact matrices accordingly. Similarly, if we consider different work resumption plans, we will need to increase these weights proportional to the rate of work resumption. Specifically, we reduce rW from its original value to 0 as of Jan. 23 (the starting date of implementing stringent public health control policies). Moreover, we gradually recover its value from the starting date of our work resumption plans to reflect the effect of \u201cback-to-work\u201d policies. We apply the similar rationale to rS and rP. For rH, as the public social distancing policies would increase social contacts within households, we increase the value of rH starting from Jan. 23, and gradually reduce to its original value once the \u201cback-to-work\u201d policy kicks in.",

In contrast, the distribution of age-groups with intensive contacts in schools and workplaces are relatively concentrated. Moreover, the composition of people in these two settings is relatively stable, making the management easier than that in public places or communities. Because most of the schools and workplaces were closed before the Chinese Spring Festival and have not been reopened or resumed yet, the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak in these two settings is relatively limited.

As the public health crisis escalates, countries have responded by enforcing social distancing measures, such as the closure of public venues and reduced working hours, to reduce the chance of contracting the highly contagious virus in a social setting. At the same time, this will inevitably lead to a massive decline in business activities, causing unprecedented economic loss to the countries. When the COVID-19 outbreak becomes gradually contained, as in the case of Wuhan, China, it is foreseeable that the countries will soon face the dilemma of whether and when to resume social activities and bring work and life back to normal, as any pre-mature resumption of social contacts could potentially cause a rebound (second wave) in new infection cases. In the light of the pressing needs to provide a scientific ground for systematically planning the resumption of social/business activities after the peak, or near the end, of the outbreak, we present a prospective analysis of different work resumption plans, which can enable us to assess not only the respective economic implications of the plans, but more importantly, the levels of disease transmission risks associated with the corresponding plans.",

Since Wuhan was in a serious situation during the outbreak, its work resumption may take longer than the other 5 cities; its detailed plans for the resumption and associated risks are discussed in the Supplementary as shown in Figure S1. We conduct our prospective study on 2 sets of different work resumption plans (Plans A1-A3 and Plans B1-B3) and accordingly examine their associated risks of disease transmission. Plans A1-A3 resume work when the disease transmission is well under control, i.e., the number of new reported cases is about to become zero. Specifically, Plans A1-A3 start on Feb. 17 (Monday) and finish the resumption by 1 week, 1/2 months, and 1 month, respectively. Plans B1-B3 are stricter than Plans A1-A3: they resume work when the number of new reported cases has been zero for three consecutive days. Therefore, Plans B1-B3 start on Feb. 24 (Monday) and, similarly, finish the resumption by 1 week, 1/2 months, and 1 month, respectively.",

The trends in Figure 4 are measured by the total number of confirmed cases. From Figure 4(A) we can observe that the disease trends in all six cities are relatively sensitive to the variations in the infectivity in G5 (23-44) and G6 (45-64). There are two main reasons. First, both the population size and the case number in these two age-groups are relatively large. Second, people in these two groups are more frequently engaged in social activities than those in other age-groups. Therefore, a slight variation on the infectivity in these two groups might cause relatively large variations in the disease trends. From Figure 4(B) we can observe that the variations of the disease trends are more obvious in households than in schools, workplaces, and public places/communities, which is consistent with our observations in Figure 2. The reason is that China has already implemented strong social distancing strategies, such as the closure of schools and workplaces, and thus the variations of social contact intensities in schools and workplaces have relatively limited impact on the disease trends. Note that even various intervention strategies have been deployed, the disease trends can still be relatively sensitive to the variations of social contact intensities in public places and communities. The key implication, as revealed by Figure 4(B), is to maintain proper social distance in public/community, even when school and business activities are resumed. Moreover, there are some intrinsic consistencies between the results in Figures 4(A) and 4(B). Note that the group in Figures 4(A) with the highest sensitivity is G5, in the age of 23-44. People of this age are generally the family breadwinner and play the most active role in social activities. If they are infected, they will bring a huge risk to their family members in households and their friends and acquaintances in communities. This explains the observation in Figures 4(A), i.e., the variation of infectivity in G5 brings the highest impact on the disease trends, and thus reminds the public health workers to pay special attention to this group of population when implementing control and prevention strategies in a later stage.",

With an in-depth characterization of the age-specific social contact-based transmission, we conducted the retrospective and prospective analyses of the disease outbreak, including the past and future disease transmission trends, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities. We focused on 6 representative cities in China; the conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the contact-based risk analysis methodology that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, who are currently under high risks, so as to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic.",

On the one hand, the selected cities are representative in terms of the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in the respective region during the time that the study was conducted and their economic impact in China. On the other hand, they have presented different characteristics in several important aspects: First, the categories of confirmed cases in these cities are different. For Wuhan, most of the cases are indigenous cases; while in the other 5 cities, a large portion of the cases is imported cases (from Hubei Province). Second, the distributions of populations in different age-groups are different in these cities. Third, the levels of social distancing interventions and the work resumption plans implemented in different cities are different. The above differences make the scenarios in different cities quite different and intriguing. The retrospective and prospective analyses conducted on these cities show that our results are consistent with the real situations of the corresponding cities, validating the model's generalization ability given different real-world contexts. Importantly, it should be noted that, although the numerical results derived from the 6 cities in this study may not be the same as those in other countries, the developed methods are general at the methodological level and the idea of using age-specific contacts to characterize the disease transmission patterns is instructive in understanding, and hence planning corresponding interventions in, the situations of the disease outbreaks in those countries. When applying the developed methodology to the wider global population, country/region-specific scenarios and settings, such as case categories, distribution of age-specific population, working environment and hours, and interventions and work resumption plans, should be incorporated to provide better tailor-made parameterization, thus making the retrospective and prospective analyses more situation-specific and informative.",

As a result, the parameters estimated based on the current understanding might not be as adequate or precise as those in some of the well-understood diseases, such as seasonal influenza. Therefore, one of our future research directions is to continue investigating the characteristics of the disease, from both epidemiological and computational perspectives, so as to parameterize the model in a more accurate way. Further, in this study, we have modeled the underlying transmission of COVID-19 outbreak by considering the age-specific social contact patterns. It should be pointed out that there also exist other disease-related factors that might affect the disease transmission patterns, such as the cross-region mobility of the population and the environmental factors. We plan to incorporate these disease-related factors into the model, thus making our analysis more comprehensive. Moreover, the current study focuses on the representative cities in China. However, since the pandemic of COVID-19 is becoming more serious around the world, it will be desirable to conduct further analyses on a global scale. In this regard, the general methodology provided in this study can readily be applied, while considering country/region-specific social, demographic, and epidemiological characteristics, such as infection-related social contact patterns [37]. To further generalize and transfer our research, we plan to collaborate with researchers and practitioners around the world to conduct the corresponding analyses for other countries/regions.",
