Type I IFN was identified on the basis of its functional ability to restrict viral replication. Soon after its discovery, specific types of nucleic acids were found to potently induce this key antiviral cytokine and thus mimic the presence of virus1. The identification of the corresponding immune sensing receptors was a prerequisite to any real understanding of how self and non-self nucleic acids can be distinguished.",

Thus, the recognition of foreign nucleic acids among an abundance of self nucleic acids in an organism is a substantial biochemical challenge. There is now a broad consensus within the field that most of the receptors involved in the immune sensing of nucleic acids have been identified. Given the substantial progress over the last few years, it seems timely to review the current literature and to convey an updated concept of nucleic acid sensing. First, we provide a brief overview of the general principles of nucleic acid sensing. Then, the current literature on RNA and DNA sensing is reviewed with a focus on self versus non-self recognition. We conclude with open questions, future perspectives and implications for human disease. For more detailed information about the molecular structure of the receptors, their specific immune functions and therapeutic development, we refer to other in-depth reviews2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.",

In vertebrates, the principle of self versus non-self nucleic acid sensing is based on three central criteria (Fig. 1): first, the availability of nucleic acid ligands as determined by their local concentration, by the rate of degradation by endogenous nucleases and by the level of shielding (for example, by nucleocapsid proteins); second, the localization of nucleic acid ligands, such as outside the cell membrane, in the endolysosomal compartment or in the cytosol; and third, the structure of nucleic acid ligands as characterized by sequence motifs, conformation (for example, base-paired versus unpaired) and chemical modification. In many cases, a combination of all three aspects contributes to the reliable recognition of potentially dangerous foreign nucleic acids leading to the induction of appropriate innate immune responses.",

These PRRs directly or indirectly induce transcription factors, including nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), that upregulate the expression of antiviral effector proteins, chemokines and cytokines (Fig. 1). This antiviral response is dominated by type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).",

Second category receptors comprise nucleic acid receptors with direct antiviral activity \u2014 for example, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)- activated protein kinase R (PKR; also known as eIF2AK2), 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). Like PRRs, they recognize the biochemical features of foreign nucleic acids. However, unlike PRRs, their major function is not to induce immune responses via transcription factors and cytokines but rather to directly act on viral RNA (for example, by inhibiting translation or by chemical modification or degradation of their target RNA). Recent findings have shown that these categories can overlap: as detailed below, RIG-I can also act as an effector molecule on viral RNA13,14, translational inhibition of PKR was reported to enhance NF-\u03baB signalling15, and RNA modifications or cleavage can inactivate or generate target RNA structures that are recognized by PRRs.",

In the cytosol, the RLRs RIG-I and MDA5, which are DExD/H box RNA helicases with caspase recruitment domains (CARDs)21, signal via mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS; also known as CARDIF, IPS1 and VISA) and IRF3\u2013IRF7 to induce type I IFNs following RNA recognition4 (Fig. 2). In addition to its signalling function, RIG-I can act as a direct antiviral effector protein that binds viral genomic RNA and interferes with viral polymerases13,14. A third cytosolic RIG-I-like helicase is LGP2 (also known as DHX58), which lacks a CARD and appears to contribute to the fine tuning of immune responses by inhibiting RIG-I and supporting MDA5 signalling22. Although LGP2 can recognize RNA, it is unclear whether this is relevant for its function23.",

The antiviral molecule ADAR1 catalyses the C6 deamination of adenosine in base-paired RNA, which results in A-to-I conversions. A-to-I conversions change the coding of RNA, as inosine (I) is read as guanosine (G) instead of adenosine (A) by ribosomes, leading to the translation of altered, potentially non-functional, proteins43. Furthermore, conversion of A-U to I-U further destabilizes potential secondary structures important for viral RNA regulation43. However, as detailed below, the destabilization of secondary structures can also impair recognition by PRRs, thereby supporting immune escape of the virus. In conclusion, the role of ADAR1 in the context of viral infections remains unclear and might depend on the type of the virus44. Notably, the expression and functions of PKR, IFIT1, OAS1 and ADAR1 are all downstream of the type I IFN-inducing nucleic acid immune receptors (such as RLRs).",

The current model for the recognition of continuous dsRNA by MDA5 is that MDA5 uses the long dsRNA as a signalling platform to cooperatively assemble a filament of MDA5 molecules in a head-to-tail arrangement with exposed CARDs along the long dsRNA; the exposed CARDs in turn recruit and activate the downstream adaptor MAVS54. It has recently been shown that the RNA-modifying activity of ADAR1 (that is, the conversion of A to I) is required to prevent endogenous dsRNA from activating MDA5 (Refs 55,56); given that there is no evidence for endogenous dsRNA of that length, these data suggest that MDA5 senses ligand motifs in addition to very long dsRNA. Several studies demonstrate that MDA5 activation concurs with the formation of dsRNA in the course of viral replication23. Recent data suggest that MDA5 contributes to the detection of (\u2212)ssRNA viruses despite the absence of long dsRNA45. MDA5 was found to bind to and be activated by the mRNA of paramyxovirus (a (\u2212)ssRNA virus)57,58, with paramyxovirus V protein binding to and inhibiting MDA5 but not RIG-I59. Furthermore, an in vivo short hairpin RNA screen identified MDA5 as one of the key antiviral proteins involved in the antiviral defence response against influenza A virus60. These data indicate that (\u2212)ssRNA viruses, which do not produce dsRNA, are sensed by MDA5 and can actively interfere with MDA5 function. It is therefore tempting to speculate that, in addition to long dsRNA, ssRNA with short base-paired secondary structures is recognized by MDA5.",

Since polyU or GU-rich sequences are not more frequent in microbial RNA compared to vertebrate RNA, it is currently unclear how the preference for these motifs may help distinguish self from non-self RNA. Furthermore, although TLR8 exclusively detects ssRNA, TLR7 primarily detects dsRNA but can also accommodate certain ssRNA oligonucleotides65. However, the biological rationale behind these sequence preferences is still unknown. Of note, in a recent study a binding site for a single ssRNA U nucleotide and another binding site for short RNA degradation products were found in a TLR8\u2013ligand co-crystal, suggesting that TLR8 is activated by degradation products of ssRNA66.

Enzymatic RNA biosynthesis is based on the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 linkage of nucleotide triphosphates and consequently leaves a free triphosphate at the 5\u2032 end in nascent RNA. Endogenous self RNA is generated in the nucleus and further processed (such as backbone or base modifications, cleavage and 5\u2032 capping), resulting in the removal or modification of accessible 5\u2032-triphosphate ends before the RNA is translocation to the cytosol. By contrast, the perfect replication of an RNA strand is a hallmark of many viruses and is always linked to the formation of a blunt end dsRNA structure containing 5\u2032-triphosphate ends, which is recognized by cytosol RNA sensors. Furthermore, some (-)ssRNA viruses (for example, influenza virus) that minimize the occurrence of dsRNA by binding their ssRNA to nucleocapsid proteins possess genomes that form panhandle structures with a blunt end, due to partially complementary terminal sequences23. These partially complementary terminal sequences are a result of two ssRNA replication origins at the ends of the viral genomic RNA that are conserved, as both are recognized by the same viral RNA polymerase. Panhandle structures are recognized by RIG-I, a cytosol RNA sensor.",

IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to recognize either 5\u2032-triphosphate ssRNA or a triphosphorylated ssRNA overhang of at least 5 nt in length in the case of IFIT1, or 3 nt in length in the case of IFIT5 (Ref. 37). Conversely, base pairing within the first 5 or 3 nt abrogates recognition37. The presence of a 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine cap (m7G cap) enhances IFIT1 binding, confirming that IFIT1 targets mRNA for translational inhibition and does not target viral genomic RNA38,39. Activation of PKR by 5\u2032-triphosphorylated 'single-stranded' RNA with secondary structures starts at a length of about 47 nt, and an m7G cap abrogates PKR binding86.

Members of the Picornaviridae family prime RNA transcription using a non-canonical cap-like structure termed VPg that is covalently linked to a uridine dimer (VPg\u2013pUpU), thereby avoiding the presence of a 5\u2032-triphosphate and escaping recognition by both RIG-I and IFIT1 (Ref. 93). Furthermore, Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Hantaan virus and Borna disease virus have been reported to prevent RIG-I-mediated detection of their genomes by an RNA prime-and-realign mechanism that shifts the panhandle structure to generate an 5\u2032 overhang and by cleavage of the 5\u2032 terminal base of their genomic RNA leaving monophosphorylated 5\u2032 ends95.

However, it turned out that AT-rich DNA in the cytosol can also indirectly induce type I IFN via RNA-sensing receptors: cytosolic poly(dAdT) DNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III into 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA and folds into 5\u2032-triphosphate dsRNA, which strongly activates RIG-I111,112. However, the biological relevance of this pathway is unclear, as AT-rich DNA is rather uncommon and self-complementarity is a prerequisite for RIG-I stimulation. Numerous candidate cytosolic dsDNA receptors \u2014 including ZBP1, DEAD box protein 41 (DDX41), IFI16, the DNA-PK complex (DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase complex), MRE11, polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) and cGAS \u2014 have been proposed to activate the IRF3 pathway (but not the RIG-I-dependent DNA sensing pathway) for type I IFN production (also known as the interferon stimulatory DNA pathway (ISD pathway))113,114.",

It is broadly accepted that the mitochondrial adaptor protein stimulator of IFN genes (STING; also known as MITA, ERIS and MPYS) is downstream of the DNA receptor and is essential for the activation of the IRF3-dependent pathway115,116 (Fig. 4). STING was found to sense both cyclic dinucleotides secreted by intracellular bacteria117,118 and the endogenous cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP (cyclic GMP\u2013AMP), which contains one 2\u2032-5\u2032-phosphodiester linkage and a canonical 3\u20325\u2032 linkage (c[G(2\u2032-5\u2032)pA(3\u2032-5\u2032)p]). cGAMP functions as a second messenger and is generated by cGAS following binding of cytosolic DNA119,120,121,122. Crystal structures of cGAS and in vitro activation assays demonstrate that dsDNA directly activates the catalytic activity of cGAS123,124,125,126,127,128. In vivo, the DNA receptor cGAS is essential for the detection of dsDNA genome-based viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), vaccinia virus and adenovirus119,129,130, as well as for retroviruses126,131,132,133.",

Unexpectedly, stem-loop ssDNA structures, which are characteristic of retroviruses and retroviral elements such as ssDNA reverse transcripts from HIV1, potently activates cGAS, although the stems in such stem-loop structures are shorter than 40 bp108,133. Further evidence showed that the presence of guanosines in the loops or in short single-stranded 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-flanking sequences was required for cGAS activation and that the sequence of the dsDNA stem regions had no impact on activity133.

Most of the template RNA in the cytosol is rapidly degraded by RNase H. Using a mutated HIV1 reverse transcriptase, which impaired dsDNA but not ssDNA synthesis, the induction of type I IFN by lentiviral particles correlated with the presence of cytosolic ssDNA rather than the presence of dsDNA133. This finding is corroborated by the observation that elite controllers of HIV1 infection produce more type I IFN because of the cytosolic accumulation of HIV1 ssDNA reverse transcripts140. Here, the observed recognition of guanosines in unpaired DNA by cGAS may be essential for ssDNA recognition in the cytosol. In conclusion, primary ssDNA reverse transcripts appear to be the crucial DNA species recognized by cGAS during HIV1 infection and a special mechanism that allows for sensing of guanosine-rich Y-form DNA structures enables the sensitive detection of ssDNA.",

Of note, the AC-repetitive DNA strand that lacks CpG has no TLR9 activity as a single strand, underlining the RNA\u2013DNA hybrid as a real recognition motif. Based on structural models, the mechanism through which RNA\u2013DNA hybrids and dsDNA bind to cGAS is similar145. Indeed, RNA\u2013DNA hybrids of the homopolymers poly(rA) and poly(dT) were found to activate cGAS but less robustly then dsDNA145. However, whether the accumulation of high levels of DNA\u2013RNA hybrids in the cytosol is possible in the presence of RNase H activity is unclear. Altogether, the main dsDNA receptors (cGAS and TLR9) can also sense DNA\u2013RNA hybrids. However, the biological relevance of DNA\u2013RNA sensing during infections needs to be investigated.",

One is endogenous methylation of the C5 carbon of cytosine within CpG motifs, which inhibits recognition by and activation of TLR9 (Refs 141,143). Another form of base modification occurs in the context of oxidative stress: the presence of reactive oxygen species as a result of UV radiation or cell stress leads to the incorporation of oxidative adducts, the most common of which is 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG) (Fig. 5). Thus, the 8-OHG modification is indicative of oxidative damage. 8-OHG modifications have important consequences for the immune response: 8-OHG stabilizes DNA against degradation by the cytosolic DNA exonuclease TREX1, leading to the accumulation of cytosolic DNA and an increased cGAS activation146 (Fig. 5).",

Cell death-derived DNA, DNA damage and endogenous retroviral elements are sources of self DNA that may accumulate in the circulation, in endolysosomes and in the cytosol of phagocytic cells. Three DNases continuously limit immune recognition of such DNA through degradation (Fig. 4). DNase I is secreted and degrades DNA in the circulation. The loss of DNase I causes a phenotype similar to systemic lupus erythematosus147. Lysosomal DNase II not only degrades phagocytosed DNA but is also crucial for the deletion of nuclear DNA that enters the autophagy pathway148. DNase II deficiency is fatal due to the expression of type I IFN during embryogenesis, but mice can be partially rescued via concurrent type I IFN receptor deficiency but develop a polyarthritis-like disease149,150. The tissue-specific activation of AIM2 and the TLR pathway by self DNA in DNase II-deficient mice has been associated with polyarthritis151,152. TREX1 degrades DNA in the cytosol (Fig. 4) and TREX1 deficiency in humans causes the autoinflammatory Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome153. The fatal phenotypes of TREX1-deficient and DNase II-deficient mice, as well as associated polyarthritis, can be reversed by knockout of the gene encoding cGAS148,154,155,156. In contrast to its suppressive role on cytoplasmic DNA receptor activation, DNase II was reported to support the stimulation of endosomal TLR9 by enhancing the accessibility of ssDNA ligands from bacterial DNA in the endosome157.",

These perturbations can also contribute to the pathogenesis of type I diabetes (owing to genetic variants of RIG-I and MDA5 (Refs 2,162,163)).

Polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is a co-receptor of cGAS that recognizes HIV reverse transcripts. AIM2 activation results in the formation of the AIM2 inflammasome, which induces IL-1\u03b2 maturation and pyroptosis via ASC and caspase 1 (not shown). Recognition of dsDNA in the nucleus by RAD50 activates caspase recruitment domain 9 (CARD9)\u2013BCL-10 to induce NF-\u03baB, which upregulates pro-IL-1\u03b2 transcription. DNA-sensing receptors implicated in the DNA damage response and nuclear recognition of viral nuclear DNA includes breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1), IFI16, DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (DNA-PK) and MRE11, and these molecules also signal via STING. Ribonuclease H (RNase H) degrades DNA\u2013RNA hybrids. ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. \nPowerPoint slide\n",

Cytosolic DNA is efficiently degraded by 3\u2032 repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) located in the cytosol. Oxidation of DNA, which occurs in situations of oxidative stress caused by UV radiation or cell stress, leads to oxidation of DNA, the most common of which is 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG). This stabilizes DNA against degradation by TREX1, resulting in an accumulation of DNA in the cytosol. Oxidated DNA is recognized by cGAS, resulting in the formation of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, which activates STING to induce type I interferon (IFN) production. \nPowerPoint slide\n",
