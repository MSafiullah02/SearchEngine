            "text": "Introduction 2020 saw the emergence of a global pandemic, the disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which began in China and has since spread across the world. One of the most common, but difficult questions to answer during the COVID-19 pandemic has been regarding the true infection-fatality rate (IFR) of the disease. While case-fatality rates (CFR) are eminently calculable from various published data sources (1) , it is far more difficult to extrapolate to the proportion of all infected individuals who have died due to the infection because those who have very mild, atypical or asymptomatic disease are frequently left undetected and therefore omitted from fatality-rate calculations (2) . Given the difficulty of obtaining accurate estimates, it is not unexpected that there are wide disparities in the published estimates of infection. This is an issue for several reasons, most importantly in that policy is dependent on modelling, and modelling is dependent on assumptions. If we do not have a robust estimate of IFR, it is challenging to make predictions about the true impact of COVID-19 in any given susceptible population, which may stymie policy development and may have serious consequences for decisionmaking into the future. While CFR is a more commonly-used statistic, and is very widely understood among experts, IFR provides important context for policy makers that is hard to convey, particularly given the wide variation in CFR estimates. While CFR is naturally a function of the denominator -i.e. how many people have been tested for the disease -policy-makers are often most interested in the total burden in the population rather than the biased estimates given from testing only the acutely unwell patients. This is particularly important when considering the reopening of countries post 'lockdown'. Depending on the severity of the disease, it may be reasonable to reopen services such as schools, bars, and clubs, at different timings. Another salient point is the expected burden of disease in younger age groupswhile there are likely long-term impacts other than death, it will be important for future planning to know how many people in various age groups are likely to die if the infection becomes widespread across societies. Age-stratified estimates are also important as it may give countries some way to predict the number of deaths expected given their demographic breakdown.",

One method used successfully for influenza has been retrospective modelling studies predicting the 'true' number of cases and deaths from influenza-like illness records and/or excess mortality estimates (3, 4) . This is in part due to the general difficulty in attributing influenza cases to subsequent mortality, meaning that CFRs may both overestimate and equally underestimate the true number of deaths due to the disease in a population (5) . The standard test for COVID-19 involves polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs from patients suspected of having contracted the virus. This can produce some false negatives, with one study demonstrating almost a quarter of patients experiencing a positive result following up to two previous false negatives (6) . PCR is also limited in that it cannot test for previous infection. Serology testing is more invasive, requiring a blood sample, however it can determine if there has been previous infection and can be performed rapidly at the point of care (PoC). Serology PoC testing cannot determine if a person is infectious, or if infection is recent and there is risk of misinterpretation of results (7) .",

For example, Israel, with a median age of 30 years, would expect a lower IFR than Italy, with a much higher median age (45.4 years).
