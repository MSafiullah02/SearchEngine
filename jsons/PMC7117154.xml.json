            "text": "Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a single negative-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family and shows a close genetic relationship with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). The genome is translated into 11 proteins by 10 mRNAs (Gershwin et al., 2005; Meyer et al., 2008). BRSV is the primary etiological agent of respiratory disease in calves aged up to 12 months (Gershwin et al., 2005); indeed, it is a major cause of respiratory disease in beef and dairy calves worldwide (Beaudeau et al., 2010; Klima et al., 2014). BRSV is capable of infecting feedlot cattle and cattle on dairy farms, resulting in clinical disease in the absence of bacteria (Larsen et al., 2001; Tj\u00f8neh\u00f8j et al., 2003); however, initial infection by BRSV suppresses the bovine immune system and facilitates secondary infection of the lower respiratory tract by bacteria (Larsen et al., 2001; Gershwin et al., 2005). Therefore, BRSV is considered to be a causative agent of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), which results in economic losses to farmers because of the morbidity and mortality in cattle (Beaudeau et al., 2010; Klima et al., 2014).",

Each pathogen harbors unique features that enable it to act as either a primary source of infection or as a partner in cases of multi-pathogen infection; such infections compromise the protective barrier function of the respiratory epithelium (H\u00e4rtel et al., 2004; Gershwin et al., 2005). It was reported that the adherences of these bacteria were increased to virus infected respiratory epithelia cells (Galdiero et al., 2002).",

            "text": "According to our preliminary findings based on the BRDC gene detection from respiratory samples, paired virus and bacteria were detected and PM was the most common bacterial agent (unpublished data). PM is common in the nasopharynx of cattle (Timsit et al., 2016; Holman et al., 2017), but not all calves harboring the bacterium develop pneumonia (Autio et al., 2007; Holman et al., 2017). However, although PM appears to be part of the normal flora, it can contribute to pneumonia when cattle become stressed and/or infected by a respiratory virus (Dabo et al., 2007). To act as a pathogen, PM must adhere to and invade epithelial cells (Dabo et al., 2005). Disruption of the epithelial lining of the lower respiratory tract allows bacteria to invade the lungs and cause a secondary bacterial infection (Tj\u00f8neh\u00f8j et al., 2003; Gershwin et al., 2005). Treatment of BRSV-infected bovine alveolar cells with Histophilus somni concentrated culture supernatant results in morphological changes (cell rounding, retraction, and para-cellular migration) (Agnes et al., 2013). Studies in humans demonstrate that infection by HRSV increases adherence of Streptococcus pneumonia to respiratory epithelial cells (Yokota et al., 2010) and increases biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Hendricks et al., 2016).",

Previously, we confirmed that HRSV infection upregulates expression of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-R), a receptor for S. pneumonia, on A549 (Yokota et al., 2010). Similar phenomena are observed during infection with rhinovirus and coronavirus, which upregulate expression of fibronectin, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule, and PAF-R on respiratory epithelial cells (Ishizuka et al., 2003; Golda et al., 2011).

In addition, the presence of more than one microorganism in the respiratory tract can lead to more severe pneumonia (Larsen et al., 2001; Klima et al., 2014). Here, we found that epithelial cells exposed to PM showed increased expression of genes encoding IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES; however, expression increased further upon co-infection with BRSV. We assume that upregulation of these cytokines depends on the number of PM cells adhering to the respiratory epithelial cells. These cytokines play important roles in BRDC-related pneumonia. Cytokines and other mediators released by bovine cells and virus-infected cells contribute to the pathogenesis of BRDC by inducing leukocyte recruitment, attachment, and activation (N\u2019jai et al., 2013; McGill et al., 2016). BHV-1 infection of bovine bronchial epithelial cells (Rivera-Rivas et al., 2009) and mononuclear cells (Leite et al., 2004) triggers cytokine expression; these cytokines then recruit and activate neutrophils and exacerbate the detrimental effects of MH. Thus, it might be that upregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines, triggered by co-infection with BRSV and PM, initiates an acute and local inflammatory response in the lungs, thereby contributing to development of BRDC.",

(2002) point out that an in vitro model is essential to clarify the relationship between virus and bacterium. Our previous report shows that innate immune responses to HRSV infection of A549 cells are different from those in telomerase reverse transcriptase-transfected human primary respiratory cells (Okabayashi et al., 2011). Thus, establishing an in vitro co-infection model based on primary bovine respiratory epithelial cells will not only help identify the origin of inflammatory responses in BRDC but also help us to strengthen the first line of defense against BRDC-related pathogens.",
