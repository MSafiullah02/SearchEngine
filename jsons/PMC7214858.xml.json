Although most cases are mild to moderate in severity, about 15% develop severe pneumonia, and nearly 5% progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure [25, 49]. This worsening is predominantly driven by cytokine upregulation and an exaggerated yet maladaptive inflammatory response [35, 40, 47]. Direct viral infection and cytopathic effects may also play a role. In the sickest patients, a hyperimmune response characterized by cytokine storm leads to critical illness and end-organ dysfunction, with high mortality. Mortality rates increase with severity of illness, and rates > 50% have been described in critically ill patients [7, 18, 48]. No measures, other than supportive therapy, have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19, constituting a major unmet medical need.",

All treatments await validation in large-scale randomized controlled trials. Given their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects, various cell types have also emerged as therapeutic candidates. In 2013\u20132014, 17 patients with H7N9 influenza were treated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and outcomes were compared to 44 controls. Higher survival rate was noted in the MSC group compared to controls (82.4% vs 45.5%, respectively) [12]. For COVID-19, MSCs were recently investigated in a small case series out of China, but only one patient was critically ill [26].",

These cells are entirely distinct from c-kit+ putative cardiac progenitors [13, 27], which have been the subject of various retracted studies [23]. Since CDCs were first isolated from human endomyocardial biopsies in 2007, these cells have been tested in > 200 patients in clinical trials for myocardial infarction, heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome [29, 30]. These trials, along with extensive preclinical investigation (~ 200 publications from > 55 independent laboratories worldwide), have demonstrated immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of CDCs (Fig. 1) [30]. Head-to-head comparisons in preclinical models indicate that CDCs may be more effective than MSCs with regards to paracrine factor secretion and myocardial remodeling [27]. Given the safety record of CDCs in humans, and the substantial body of evidence confirming relevant disease-modifying bioactivity, applicability to COVID-19 seemed compelling, particularly in the hyperinflammatory stage of the illness. Due to the scope of the pandemic and unmet need for effective therapies, we evaluated safety and impact of administration of allogeneic CDCs, formulated for intravenous (IV) infusion as CAP-1002, in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

We, therefore, retrospectively characterized a set of patients admitted to CSMC on or after 3/1/2020 with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who required mechanical ventilation. To render the comparison as fair as possible, we quantified clinical status at 30.7 days of hospitalization (to match the average in the CAP-1002-treated subjects) and limited the analysis to patients who received anti-IL6 or anti-IL6 receptor agents during the hospitalization as standard-of-care therapy (as did all of the CAP-1002-treated subjects). Patients were excluded if they: (1) did not have at least 30.7 days of follow-up from admission to the terminal event (death or hospital discharge); (2) were enrolled in any clinical trial requiring informed consent; and (3) had a tracheostomy placed prior to the current admission.",

Following administration of the cells, the patients were monitored for signs of clinical and biochemical improvement (or deterioration). If the patients continued to require significant supplemental oxygen after one week, they were re-evaluated for a second dose of cell administration as a booster dose. Prior to administration of the second dose, patients were premedicated with an antihistamine to mitigate any potential allergic reactions (which, though clinically insignificant, were noted in two patients in the HOPE-2 clinical trial when premedication was omitted before the second dose). The rationale for a second administration of CAP-1002 is based on preclinical evidence demonstrating additional benefit with repeat dosing of CDCs. Importantly, a repeat administration of CDCs was not associated with sensitization or adverse immunologic responses in rodents [2, 36].",

Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the higher survival rates in the CAP-1002 group when compared against a contemporaneous cohort that similarly received anti-IL-6 therapy and hydroxychloroquine. Furthermore, two drugs that were administered in our cohort of 6 patients and could have a potential confounding effect (lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine) were recently demonstrated to have no efficacy in COVID-19 patients [8, 28].
