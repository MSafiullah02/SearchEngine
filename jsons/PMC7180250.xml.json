            "text": "On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19). Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus that was closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from these patients (1\u20133). This new virus has been recently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (4). Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), present with acute onset of fever, myalgia, cough, dyspnea, and radiological evidence of ground-glass lung opacities compatible with atypical pneumonia (5\u20137). However, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have also been reported (2, 8\u201310). Initial epidemiological investigations have indicated the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan as a geographically linked source, but subsequent detailed epidemiological assessment has revealed that up to 45% of the early cases with symptom onset before 1 January 2020 were not linked to this market (5, 11). Person-to-person transmissions among close family contacts and health care workers, including those without travel history to Wuhan, have been reported (2, 7, 12, 13). Therefore, clinical features and epidemiological links to Wuhan alone are not reliable for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

The use of viral culture for establishing acute diagnosis is not practical, as it takes at least 3 days for SARS-CoV-2 to cause obvious cytopathic effects in selected cell lines, such as VeroE6 cells (3). Moreover, isolation of the virus requires biosafety level 3 facilities, which are not available in most health care institutions. Serum antibody and antigen detection tests have not yet been validated, and there may be cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, which shares a high degree (\u223c82%) of nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 (17). Because of these limitations, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) remains the most useful laboratory diagnostic test for COVID-19 worldwide.",

The protocol of the first real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were published on 23 January 2020 (20). Among these assays, the RdRp assay had the highest analytical sensitivity (3.8 RNA copies/reaction at 95% detection probability) (20). In this published RdRp assay, probe 1 was a \u201cpan Sarbeco-Probe\u201d which would detect SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat SARS-related coronaviruses, whereas probe 2 (termed \u201cRdRp-P2\u201d assay in the present study) was reported to be specific for SARS-CoV-2 and should not detect SARS-CoV (20). Notably, these assays were designed and validated using synthetic nucleic acid technology and in the absence of available SARS-CoV-2 isolates or original patient specimens (20). The reported RdRp assays had been implemented in >30 laboratories in Europe (21). In this study, we developed novel, highly sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 and compared their performances with that of the established RdRp-P2 assay using both in vitro and patient specimens. Clinical evaluation using different types of clinical specimens from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 showed that our novel assay targeting a different region of the RdRp/Hel was significantly more sensitive and specific than the RdRp-P2 assay.",

For in vitro specificity evaluation, archived laboratory culture isolates (n = 17) of other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses used were obtained from the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, as previously described (23). All experimental protocols involving live SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV followed the approved standard operating procedures of the biosafety level 3 facility as previously described (24, 25). For the clinical evaluation study, a total of 273 (120 respiratory tract and 153 non-respiratory tract) clinical specimens were collected from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong whose nasopharyngeal aspirate/swabs, throat swabs, and/or sputum specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the RdRp2 assay (22). Additionally, the total nucleic acid extracts of 22 archived (stored at \u201380\u00b0C until use) nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs and throat swabs collected from 22 adult patients who were managed at our hospitals in Hong Kong for upper and/or lower respiratory tract symptoms that tested positive for other respiratory pathogens by FilmArray RP2 (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for assessing potential cross-reactivity of the assays with other respiratory pathogens in clinical specimens. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority (UW 14-249).",

To investigate whether the novel COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N assays cross-react with SARS-CoV, other human-pathogenic coronaviruses, and respiratory viruses, we used the assays to test 17 culture isolates of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses, influenza B virus, influenza C virus, parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 4, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. As shown in Table 4, no cross-reactivity with these viruses was found in either assay. Unlike what was previously reported, we found that the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV culture lysate (20). This cross-reactivity was consistently observed in two independent runs conducted on different days with each run having three technical replicates of each biological replicate (two biological replicates, SARS-CoV strains HKU-39849 and GZ50) and stringent compliance with the published protocol.",

Traditionally, the preferred targets of coronavirus RT-PCR assays included the conserved and/or abundantly expressed genes such as the structural S and N genes and the nonstructural RdRp and replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b genes (16, 28). For COVID-19, the protocols of a number of RT-PCR assays used by different institutes have recently been made available online (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance). These assays target the ORF1a/b, ORF1b-nsp14, RdRp, S, E, or N gene of SARS-CoV-2, and some are nonspecific assays that would detect SARS-CoV-2 and other related betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (20, 29). Importantly, the in-use evaluation data of these assays using a large number of clinical specimens from patients with confirmed COVID-19 are lacking. In this study, we developed and evaluated three novel real-time RT-PCR assays that target different gene regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We showed that the novel COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in vitro and in COVID-19 patient specimens.",

The LOD with genomic RNA was also very low (1.80 TCID50/ml). Importantly, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was significantly more sensitive (P \u2264 0.001) than the established RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both respiratory tract and non-respiratory tract clinical specimens. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 42/273 (15.4%) additional specimens that tested negative by the RdRp-P2 assay. These findings are clinically and epidemiologically relevant, because asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases of COVID-19 have been increasingly recognized, and these patients with cryptic pneumonia may serve as a potential source for propagating the epidemic (2, 8). Given the large number of patients (>60,000 cases in China at the time of writing) involved in this expanding epidemic, the additional positive specimens detected by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay might translate into thousands of specimens that would otherwise be considered SARS-CoV-2 negative by the less-sensitive RdRp-P2 assay.",

False-negative results might arise from testing nasopharyngeal aspirate/swabs or throat swabs with low viral loads in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients (2, 30\u201333). RT-PCR assays with higher sensitivity, such as the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, might help to reduce the false-negative rate among these specimens which are frequently the only specimens available for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19. We have previously shown that saliva has a high concordance rate with nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of influenza viral RNA and might also be a suitable specimen for diagnosing COVID-19 (22, 34). The use of the highly sensitive COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay to test saliva specimens from suspected cases of COVID-19 might be a simple and rapid way to avoid the need of aerosol-generating procedures during collection of nasopharyngeal aspirates and suction of sputum, especially in regions most heavily affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak where there are insufficient supplies of full personal protective equipment (13). SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia has been reported in a small proportion of COVID-19 patients (2, 5). However, as shown in our clinical evaluation in which the RdRp-P2 assay gave negative test results for all 10 plasma specimens that gave positive test results by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, the genuine incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia might be underestimated by less sensitive RT-PCR assays. We have previously shown that high serum viral loads in SARS patients were associated with more severe disease as evidenced by a higher incidence of oxygen desaturation, need for mechanical ventilation, hepatic dysfunction, and death (35). Thus, serial monitoring of the plasma viral load in COVID-19 patients with the highly sensitive COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay should be considered to provide prognostic insights and facilitate treatment decisions.",

We postulated that this might be due to the small number (n = 3) of nucleotide differences between the probe used in the RdRp-P2 assay with at least three strains of SARS-CoV (20). This cross-reactivity would be especially important for laboratories in areas where SARS-CoV might reemerge and cocirculate with SARS-CoV-2, as the differences in clinical progression between SARS and COVID-19 remain incompletely understood at this stage.",
