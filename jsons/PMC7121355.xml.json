Given increased resources and responsibilities, health departments hired more epidemiologists and deployed robust information technology to support public health preparedness and response.

Following events such as 9/11, the anthrax attacks, and hurricane Katrina, the debate ensued regarding exactly what public health emergency preparedness was and how it should be measured [29.45]. Regardless of one\u02bcs definition of public health emergency preparedness, it is clear preparedness and response depend on location-based information, such as the location of incidents, where responders are, and where emergency services and health facilities are located. GIS supports emergency preparedness through\n\nNeeds assessments and planning.\n\nEvacuation route planning.\n\nModeling chemical spills.\n\nTargeting emergency notifications.\n\nDetermining\nsites for points of dispensing (PODS).\n\nEnhancing the utility of emergency operations center (EOC) software.\nDuring a public health emergency, there will be dozens, perhaps hundreds, of response efforts going on simultaneously through both the public and the private sectors. Besides helping all responders and those directing them attain situational awareness (by seeing response activities on the map), flexibility is one of the most useful features of a GIS. By altering the planning assumptions that are entered into the GIS, public health officials can conduct analyses quickly and efficiently on any issue for which data are available [29.46].\n\nUsing GIS (including data analysis pre and post mapping) helps to sensibly choose the best places to locate our limited resources in order to improve service to the public that we serve [29.47].\n\nFor disaster planning [29.48]:\n\nThe analysis revealed many opportunities for improvement and as a result, GIS has now become a pivotal tool in the County\u02bcs planning process.\n\nMany public health authorities now have EOCs in order to increase situational awareness, collaborate with other first responders, and mount a more effective response. Increasingly, public health is seen as a first responder like fire, police, and public safety. There are many roles for GIS in health EOCs. The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific states that information is the lifeblood of an EOC in [29.49]. The guide suggests an action plan should include supporting materials such as a map of the event area; and the checklist of recommended equipment and supplies also includes maps and aerial photos. In any emergency response, the EOC will ask many where questions.\n\nWhere are the incidents? Where are they headed (e.g., wildfires, storms, chemical spills)?\n\nWhere are the people at risk?\n\nWhere are the health assets (fixed, such as hospitals and clinics)?\n\nWhere should we send our employees (e.g., during H1N1, the EOC at CDC in the USA coordinated the deployment of 1100 CDC employees [29.50])?\n\nWhere are the mobile healthcare resources (e.g., ambulances) and other first responders?\nHealth departments have begun leveraging GIS as part of their EOCs, some developing stand-alone applications [29.51] and others using GIS in conjunction with products such as WebEOC.\n\n",

Recent findings from Thailand suggest that integrated vector control programs using GIS-based foci based (i.e., conducting community intervention campaigns within a defined radius of sero-positive cases) are very effective [29.87].

Over the last decade GIS has emerged as a critical tool for planning and understanding community needs, empowering citizens to locate services, enhancing the ability of helping professionals to provide information and referral; providing analytical capabilities to staff (e.g., policy questions, case management decisions, service eligibility), helping manage large amounts of program and administrative data, enabling logistics and program support (e.g., routing efficiency), and enhancing fraud detection. Professionals working in human services agencies ask many where\nquestions such as\n\nWhere are the people who need help \u2013 those at risk?\n\nWhere are our services located?\n\nWhere should we send our employees today (e.g., many state agencies have staffs numbering over 1000)?\n\nWhat are the most efficient routes?\n\nWhere are the field staff located?\n\nWhere should we concentrate our limited fraud investigation capabilities?\n\n",
