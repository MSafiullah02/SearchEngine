Of these, 2.9 million neonates die due to complications from preterm birth (34%), intrapartum-related conditions (25%), and infections (22%) (Lawn et al. 2014). Almost all of these deaths take place in LMICs and most of them occur in families who are poor and have least access to services (Lawn et al. 2005). Such financial barriers are a major obstacle that prevents families from accessing care at health institutions, especially impacting babies who require specialized care (Nabyonga et al. 2005; Pannarunothai and Mills 1997). Access to high quality, equitable and affordable health services is essential to meet the target of Sustainable Development Goal to reduce neonatal mortality to less than 12 per thousand live births by 2030 (Liu et al. 2016).",

Ministry of Health & Population, New Era, ICF Macro, & USAID 2011; Nepal. Ministry of Health & Population & UNICEF 2015). The expense of treatment of sick children in health facilities is taken up by families with no financial scheme from the government to reduce the OOPE (Nepal. Ministry of Health & Population & UNICEF 2015). As more than 55% of women give birth at a health institution, there has been increase in the need for special care of neonates with life threatening conditions. However, health facilities providing secondary and tertiary level neonatal care services for the management of sick newborns are not publicly funded. To further progress in reducing neonatal mortality so as to reach the target set by WHO Every Newborn Action Plan of 10 or less newborn deaths per 1000 live births by 2035, financial barriers for sick newborns needs to be removed coupled with improvement in quality of care (UNICEF 2014).",

More than half of newborn babies have morbidity and the expenses incurred on neonatal illnesses are often higher than the family income (Srivastava et al. 2009). Babies born with low birth weight also incur higher medical expenses (Child Trends Data Bank 2012).

The study team then interviewed each caregiver (mother or other accompanying family member) of the sick baby at the time of discharge using a structured questionnaire to obtain social, demographic and household information (Central Bureau of Statistics 2011). Information on cost of travel, cost of accommodation of the caregiver and sick baby during the hospital stay, and expenditure made on drugs and diagnostics for the sick baby in the hospital were also obtained from the questionnaire.

The OOPE also varied significantly with hospitals and by ethnicity. Hospitals had different rates of admission for sick newborn resulting in varied OOPE. Similarly, there was varying proportion of sick babies of different ethnicity. The type of illness also varied according to ethnicity which suggests a significant difference in OOPE. To our knowledge, this is the one of the study conducted in Nepal on OOPE for sick newborn care in referral hospitals. There have been studies exploring OOPE for sick newborn in referral hospitals in South Asia. A study conducted in Bangladesh based on different cross-sectional surveys between 2009 to 2012 found the median OOPE for seeking care for a sick under-five child between USD 0.82\u20131.22 per child/visit (Tahsina et al. 2017). Medicine contributed the major portion of overall OOPE and higher overall OOPE for care seeking was associated with a priority illness which is consistent to findings in this study. A study conducted in India on OOPE to deliver public health facilities showed that an overall median OOPE was USD 11.48 (Issac et al. 2016). Similar to this study, a significant predictor for high OOPE was caste.",

Most of the caregivers travelled far distances to the hospital via ambulance, bus or through hiring a private vehicle. Caregivers are not allowed to stay in hospital and thus they need to rent a room at a guest house nearby hospital. The expenses incurred in these indirect costs are higher compared to direct costs incurred in medical expenses of drugs and diagnostics. Studies have suggested the indirect cost of care seeking can exceed the direct costs to OOPE (Ensor and Cooper 2004; McIntyre et al. 2005).
