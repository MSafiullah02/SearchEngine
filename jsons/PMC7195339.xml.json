According to the epidemiological analysis conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), 80.9% of the cases are mild/moderate pneumonia, and by February 11, the crude overall mortality rate is 2.3%.1 As the epidemiological picture of COVID-19 is evolving daily, the global mortality rate of closed cases keeps rising (www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The clinical manifestations of most patients include fever, cough, shortness of breath and myalgia etc., and radiographic evidence demonstrated pneumonia with multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity2. A fraction of patients in serious condition will proceed to complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm, which may account for the reasons for COVID-19 caused death.3, 4, 5 Despite the relatively low fatality, the transmissibility of COVID-19 is proved to be high. Basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 ranging from 1.4 to 6.47, while most of the modeling studies showed the R0 value greater than 3.6\n,\n7\n",

The four prevalent viruses of seven coronavirus family members, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, cause only the mild upper respiratory diseases, while the other two highly pathogenic strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, together with the new identified SARS-CoV-2 are regarded to pose the global threats to public health. The full-genome sequencing data from two groups revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 comprises of six major open reading frames (ORFs) and shares approximately 80% of similarity with SARS-CoV, but 98.65% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene and 96.2% identity to RaTG13 of SARS-like bat coronavirus strain, respectively.8\n,\n9 Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2).

The patients that are positive to RT-PCR tests can be diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 infection, while negative to the tests cannot rule out the possibility. The increasing number of reports from local authorities addressed the unneglectable false-negative rate in the diagnosis of suspected cases, which poses much threat to the community and adds an extra burden to the epidemic prevention. For example, the chest CT scanning from 5 suspected cases demonstrated ground-glass opacity and/or mixed consolidation, yet the initial real-time RT-PCR test showed to be negative. After a few days, all the 5 cases tested for the second or third examinations had eventually confirmed to be positive to SARS-CoV-2.13 Complementary to RT-PCR, pneumonia radiography provides strong evidence for the diagnosis. Nevertheless, more specific measurements, such as serologic methods are urgently needed in the supplement to the current diagnosis. Here we present the newly developed serological detection methods targeting the viral antibody, colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip, that conducted in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, hoping to provide supplementary diagnostic approaches for the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.",

Among these samples, 9 (23.1%) of them were positive to IgM and 15 (38.5%) of them were positive to IgG; when combine the IgG and IgM results in total 17 (43.6%) of samples were positive from 39 nucleic acid negative cases.",

The positive percentages of IgM at early, intermediate and late stages were 22.2%, 33.3% and 57.1%, respectively; the positive rate of IgG at early, intermediate and late stages were 44.4%, 66.7% and 71.4%, respectively.

Comparing with confirmed cases, the IgG and IgM positive rates were similar, albeit relatively lower. In accordant with nucleic acid positive cases, the IgG and IgM combinatorial detection strategy in clinically-diagnosed intermediate-stage patients demonstrated the maximal detection efficacy. In summary, IgM or IgG ICG strip detection in nucleic acid negative suspected patients showed promising detection capability, which would be an excellent supplementary approach in the clinically diagnostic application.",

Due to the limited knowledge related to the new virus SARS-CoV-2 at early stage of the outbreak and the capacity of virus with human-to-human transmissibility in the latent period, the infected cases were exponentially arising in Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and rapidly spread to domestic and abroad areas. Scientific groups have quickly deciphered the viral whole-genome sequence and specific primers targeting SARS-CoV-2 were designed and tested preclinically before massively diagnostic application in clinic. The viral whole-genome sequencing and viral nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR are regarded as standard diagnostic approaches. While the whole-genome sequence is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, real-time RT-PCR is relatively fast and easy to carry out in hospital laboratories, which makes the latter technique as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of clinical diagnosis. However, the gold standard also has its limitations. Based on more than 3000 detected cases by real-time RT-PCR in the clinical laboratory of Zhongnan hospital, our previous review summarized several reasons for false-negative incidence, at both detection level and patients level.14 From detection aspects, the quality and sensitivity of detection kits and viral preservation solutions from different companies may all affect the detection accuracy and result in the false-negative possibility. Besides, it is indicated that, during the disease progress, the heavy infection at the nasopharyngeal area of early stage would possibly become negative and the lower respiratory tract may severely be infected at late stage. Thus, the nasopharyngeal swab may not be the best sampling site for all patients at various disease stage. Moreover, patients with persistent anti-viral medication (such as anti-HIV drugs) may decrease the viral loading at the undetectable level. Therefore, additional detection techniques are urgently needed in the supplement to the current diagnostic shortages for the nucleic acid-negative suspected cases, whom would otherwise be ruled out.",

The antibodies are produced and secreted by B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system when the foreign pathogens invaded. IgM is usually the first responded antibody that eliminating pathogens before sufficient IgG is produced, while IgG serves as the most robust antibody-based immunity. From the retrospective study of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV, IgM and IgG were started to be detected after 7 days of onset and persistent for 2\u20133 years.15\n,\n16 Similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 patients also showed similar characteristics. As demonstrated by Zhang et al., both IgM and IgG can be detected after 5 days of onset by anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA assay.17 In accordant with Zhang et al., our study showed that both IgM and IgG were firstly detected on day 4 among the confirmed cohort and the positive rate of IgM and IgG were 11.1% and 3.6% in early stage patients, respectively. The positive rate of IgM remained approximately 75% in the intermediate and late stage patients, while IgG positive rate kept increasing during the disease progression and up to 96.8% of late-stage confirmed patients showed detectable IgG. Noteworthy, combining IgM and IgG detection results could reach the maximal testing efficacy, especially in intermediate stage. A similar trend could be captured in clinically diagnosed patients. In addition, the consistency rate of whole blood and plasma samples in IgM and IgG assays were 100% and 97.1%, respectively, demonstrating an excellent consistency between two types of samples. As the whole blood samples are capable of detecting antibody by ICG strip assay, the quick and massive viral detection in equipment-insufficient laboratories and communities is realizable.",

First of all, the sensitivity of ICG strip is comparable, especially after 7 days of onset; the detection capacity in nucleic acid-negative \u201cclinically diagnostic\u201d patients is impressive. Therefore, ICG strip is highly recommended to be utilized as the supplementary diagnostic approach in clinical applications. The ICG strip can also be widely adopted in the areas where the diagnostic capacity is limited. Secondary, the ICG strip assay is operational as it is ready to use and time-saving. The assay can be finished within 15 min without specialized equipment. Thirdly, unlike oral swab sampling that may cause stimulated retching and coughing, which increases the exposure risk of laboratory technicians, the blood collection could avoid the unnecessary risk and reduce the operation steps that may cause aerosol. Fourthly, the detection of antibodies may also indicate the disease recovery, as immunoglobulins are among the most important soldiers in the battle of viruses. Patients that initially detected as virus-positive and gradually become negative but with detectable IgG or IgM during the disease progress may be considered as recovered from this battle. It is noteworthy that ICG strip can only provide qualitative results but the serological ELISA assay against viral antibody offered the quantitative antibody titer and regarded as the superior alternation at this point. Last but not least, ICG strip can be used for community surveillance. Some healthy people in epidemic areas may already get infected but without any symptoms, the detectable antibody from their blood is the evidence of infection. The surveillance detection in epidemic areas for both healthy members and patients could provide useful information for mapping the whole pictures of viral transmission, which would help us to better understand the real situation and establish optimal policies against the epidemic.",

It is inoperable to select \u201cuninfected\u201d cases for the negative control of specificity analysis, as the patients received after the outbreak may possibly get infected with or without any symptoms. Such assay can be carried out in the areas where the epidemic is not severe and community transmission is at a low chance. Another limitation, as mentioned above, is that the ICG results are qualitative. Despite the positive bands on the strips may provide diverse gradations of color, i.e. deep or light red, the color itself doesn't correlate with the abundance of antibody.
