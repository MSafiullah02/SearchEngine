Vietnam, a country with approximately 1000 miles shared border with China, was hurried to close its border and limit mobility since the dawn of COVID-19 in Wuhan. As the news broke down, Vietnamese authorities quickly established the National steering committee to prevent and control COVID-19 [1]. Thermal screening and health checkpoints were set up at all immigration ports, air, sea and land borders. Due to the high volume of passengers immigrated from China, extra monitoring was in place for international flights from Wuhan and other provinces of the epicentre. At zero case recorded, Vietnam Prime Minister encouraged citizens to practice personal hygiene and mask-wearing in public, health promotion activities were active to inform people of scientific news of COVID-19 progression in the world.",

Eleven cases were from one commune near the capital, stemming a total lockdown for more than 1000 people in this commune for 21 days [2] All citizens in the lockdown commune were tested for COVID-19 and checked for symptoms daily to limit potential asymptomatic cases. Food and other necessities were provided free of charge, all households and the outdoor environment were sterilized frequently. By the end of February, all 16 cases had recovered and the country remained clear of COVID-19 for nearly 20 days.",

Two days after the first cases confirmed, all international flights to and from Wuhan were halted. Two weeks later, all passengers from international flights from affected countries including China, South Korea, and Iran were tested and quarantined. Further social distancing measures were enforced including banning all traditional festivals and mass gatherings, closure of schools and universities in affected regions and metro-cites. Temperature screening and hand sanitizers were required at entry in public areas, residential and workspace buildings.",

This first case showed symptoms before the flight and later infected 15 secondary cases, many of which did not show typical symptoms of COVID-19 onset. Thanks to multijurisdictional cooperation with local authorities and health stations, sensitive and broad contact tracing was done on all passengers in every plane that had case(s) of COVID-19. In total, 150 imported cases were identified from 73 international flights, of which more than 10,000 passengers and crew members on flights were successfully traced down, tested, and quarantined for 14 days.",

High levels of biosecurity at immigration points, as well as active case findings, were implemented as soon as zero cases recorded, giving Vietnam the benefit of speed. Strict restriction for affected regions, intensive contact tracing, and health monitoring was in place early, which in turn keeps effectively limit potential local transmission as well as spread to the community. Further measures are expected in light of different progressive scenarios of the disease.
