There are many examples of viruses undergoing different replicative cycles in different cell types. However, the coding capacity of the genome determines the basic replication strategy used by different viruses. This strategy may involve heavy reliance on the host cell, in which case the virus genome can be very compact and need only encode the essential information for a few proteins, for instance, in parvoviruses. Alternatively, large and complex virus genomes, such as those of poxviruses, encode most of the information necessary for replication, and the virus is only reliant on the cell for the provision of energy and the apparatus for macromolecular synthesis, such as ribosomes. Viruses with RNA genomes have no apparent need to enter the nucleus, although during the course of replication, some do. DNA viruses, as might be expected, mostly replicate in the nucleus where host cell DNA is replicated and the biochemical apparatus necessary for this process is located. However, some viruses with DNA genomes (e.g., poxviruses) have evolved to contain sufficient biochemical capacity to be able to replicate in the cytoplasm, with minimal requirement for host cell functions.",

Plant viruses must overcome different problems to animal viruses in initiating infection.

The binding site for the HIV-1 attachment protein (antireceptor), gp 120, has been mapped to the first variable region of CD4, although additional amino acids of the second variable domain also contribute toward binding. The sequences important for CD4 binding have also been mapped in gp120. Deletions in this region or site substitutions abolish CD4 binding. In addition to CD4, there is at least one accessory factor which is necessary to form a functional HIV-1 receptor. These factors have now been identified as a family of proteins known as b-chemokine receptors. Multiple members of this class of proteins have been shown to play a role in the entry of HIV-1 into cells, and their distribution in the body is the primary control for the tropism of HIV-1 for different cell types.",

In addition, the fate of viruses absorbed into endocytic vacuoles is usually to be degraded, except in cases where the virus particle enters cells by this route. On occasion, binding of antibody-coated virus particles to Fc receptor molecules on the surface of monocytes and other blood cells can result in virus uptake.

Fusion of the virus envelope (where present) with the cell membrane, either directly at the cell surface or following endocytosis in a cytoplasmic vesicle. Fusion requires the presence of a specific fusion protein in the virus envelope, for example, influenza A virus hemagglutinin or the transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses.

As endosomes fuse with lysosomes, the environment inside these vessels becomes progressively more hostile as they are acidified and the pH falls, while the concentration of degradative enzymes rises. This means that the virus must leave the vesicle and enter the cytoplasm before it is degraded. There are a number of mechanisms by which this occurs, including membrane fusion and rescue by transcytosis. The release of virus particles from endosomes and their passage into the cytoplasm is intimately connected with (and often impossible to separate from) the process of uncoating.",

Uncoating may occur inside endosomes, being triggered by the change in pH as the endosome is acidified, or directly in the cytoplasm. Entry into the endocytic pathway is a hazardous process for viruses because if they remain in the vesicle too long, they will be irreversibly damaged by low pH or lysosomal enzymes. Hence, some viruses have evolved proteins to control this process; for example, the influenza A virus M2 protein is a membrane channel which allows entry of hydrogen ions into the nucleocapsid, facilitating uncoating. The M2 protein is multifunctional, and also has a role in virus uncoating. In the picornaviruses, penetration of the cytoplasm by exit of virus from endosomes is tightly linked to uncoating. The acidic environment of the endosome causes a conformational change in the particle at around pH 5 that reveals hydrophobic domains not present on the surface of mature virus capsids. These hydrophobic patches interact with the endosomal membrane and form pores through which the RNA genome passes into the cytoplasm of the host cell.",

            "text": "During assembly, the basic structure of the virus particle is formed as all the components necessary for the formation of the mature virion come together at a particular site in the cell. The site of assembly depends on the pattern of virus replication and the mechanism by which the virus is eventually released from the cell and so varies for different viruses. Although some DNA virus particles form in the nucleus, the cytoplasm is the most common site of particle assembly. In the majority of cases, cellular membranes are used to anchor virus proteins, and this initiates the process of assembly. For enveloped viruses, the lipid covering is acquired through a process known as budding, where the virus particle is extruded through a cell membrane. Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids (or glycolipids), cholesterol and a specific set of associated proteins. Lipid rafts have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions, such as apical sorting of proteins and signal transduction, but they are also used by viruses as platforms for cell entry (e.g., for HIV-1, SV40, and the rotaviruses), and as sites for particle assembly, budding and release from the cell membrane (e.g., in influenza A virus, HIV, measles virus, and rotaviruses).",

The site of assembly has a profound influence on all these processes. In general terms, rising intracellular levels of virus proteins and genomes reach a critical concentration and this triggers assembly. Many viruses achieve high levels of newly synthesized structural components by concentrating these into subcellular compartments known as inclusion bodies. These are a common feature of the late stages of infection of cells by many different viruses. Alternatively, local concentrations of virus structural components can be boosted by lateral interactions between membrane-associated proteins. This mechanism is particularly important in enveloped viruses which are released from the cell by budding (see above).",

This often involves structural changes in the newly formed particle resulting from specific cleavages of virus proteins to form the mature products or from conformational changes in proteins which occur during assembly (e.g., hydrophobic interactions). Protein cleavage frequently leads to substantial structural changes in the capsid. Alternatively, internal structural alterations, for example, the condensation of nucleoproteins with the virus genome, often result in changes visible by electron microscopy.",

            "text": "Proteases are frequently involved in maturation, and virus-encoded enzymes, cellular proteases or a mixture of the two may be used. Virus-encoded proteases are usually highly specific for particular amino acid sequences and structures, only cutting a particular peptide bond in a particular protein. Moreover, they are often further controlled by being packaged into virus particles during assembly and only activated when brought into close contact with their target sequence by the conformation of the capsid, for example, by being placed in a local hydrophobic environment, or by changes of pH or cation cofactor concentrations inside the particle as it forms. Retrovirus proteases are good examples of enzymes involved in maturation which are under tight control. The retrovirus core particle is composed of proteins from the gag gene and the protease is packaged into the core before its release from the cell on budding. During the budding process, the protease cleaves the gag protein precursors into the mature products -the capsid, nucleocapsid, and matrix proteins of the mature virus particle. Other protease cleavage events involved in maturation are less closely controlled. Influenza A virus hemagglutinin must be cleaved into two fragments (HA 1 and HA 2 ) to be able to promote membrane fusion during infection. Cellular trypsin-like enzymes are responsible for this process, which occurs in secretory vesicles as the virus buds into them prior to release at the cell surface; however, this process is controlled by the virus M2 protein, which regulates the pH of intracellular compartments in influenza virusinfected cells.",

The reasons for lysis of infected cells are not always clear, but virus-infected cells often disintegrate because viral replication disrupts normal cellular function, for example, the expression of essential genes. Many viruses also encode proteins that stimulate (or in some cases suppress) apoptosis, which can also result in release of virus particles.",

Virion envelope proteins are picked up during this process as the virus particle is extruded. This process is known as budding. As mentioned earlier, assembly, maturation, and release are usually simultaneous processes for viruses which are released by budding. The release of mature virus particles from their host cells by budding presents a problem in that these particles are designed to enter, rather than leave, cells. Certain virus envelope proteins are involved in the release phase of replication as well as in receptor binding. The best-known example of this is the neuraminidase protein of influenza virus. In addition to being able to reverse the attachment of virus particles to cells via hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is also believed to be important in preventing the aggregation of influenza A virus particles and may well have a role in virus release. In addition to using specific proteins, viruses which bud have also solved the problem of release by the careful timing of the assembly-maturation-release pathway. Although it may not be possible to separate these stages by means of biochemical analysis, this does not mean that spatial separation of these processes has not evolved as a means to solve this problem.",
