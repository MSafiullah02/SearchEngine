The pandemic and re-emerging potential of the disease urged the development of effective vaccines against the virus. Based on the experiences in animal coronaviral vaccines [2], [3], [4], the development of recombinant vaccines against SARS-CoV was mainly focused on its spike (S) glycoprotein [4], [5]. The S protein of CoVs, which is classified as a class I viral fusion protein, exists as radially protruded trimers on the viral envelope and can be structurally or functionally divided into two subunits, namely S1 and S2 subunits, representing the N-terminal globular head and the C-terminal membrane-bound stalk, respectively [6], [7]. The S1 subunit is responsible for virus binding to cellular receptor(s) and contains neutralizing epitopes. The S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion during viral infection and is believed to be unable to induce neutralizing antibody in a number of CoVs [8], [9], [10], [11].",

Immunization of either Escherichia coli expressed or chemically synthesized S2 peptides elicited neutralizing antibody [12], [13], [14] or specific antibody responses [15], [16] in animal models. Moreover, neutralizing epitopes were mapped on the S2 subunit by biopanning of phage display dodecapeptide library with antisera from convalescent SARS patients [17] or by screening antibody-phage display library constructed with B-cells of convalescent SARS patients [18]. Immunization of plasmids encoding the S2 subunit, which may better mimic its native antigenic properties, was reported to induce neutralizing antibodies in rabbits [19]. Our earlier study [20] also demonstrated the cooperative neutralizing effect of anti-S1 and anti-S2 antibodies from mice immunized with plasmids encoding S1 and S2 subunits. These results suggest the presence of neutralizing epitopes within the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV, which was not commonly observed in a number of other CoVs [8].",

            "text": "The mechanism of the efficient neutralizing effect of anti-S1 antibodies is logically proposed as prevention of spike-to-receptor engagement event by blocking of its receptor binding domain [5]. However, the mechanisms involved in the neutralization mediated by anti-S2 antibodies remain to be clarified. As a class I viral fusion protein, the S2 subunit of coronaviruses has its typical functional domains [21], including a fusion peptide [22], heptad repeats (HR), aromatic amino acids cluster [23] and transmembrane domain. Blocking the actions involving these domains may prevent the virus from entering its host cell, although this concept remains to be proven experimentally. Neutralizing antibody against the S2 subunit of mouse hepatitis virus was reported to bind to a determinant of nine amino acids near the fusion peptide, preventing fusion activity during virus entry [24]. Lip and colleagues [25] demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies targeting the regions both within and immediately after the C-terminal HR (C-HR) domain are able to neutralize SARS-CoV and inhibit cell\u2013cell membrane fusion, implying blocking of membrane fusion may be a possible neutralizing mechanism of anti-S2 antibodies. Recent advances in epitope mapping of gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is a membrane anchoring subunit of class I viral fusion proteins and the counterpart of SARS-CoV S2 subunit, identified several neutralizing epitopes that are proximal to the viral membrane but not near fusion peptide [26], [27], [28]. Although the mechanism of neutralization through these epitopes on gp41 of HIV is not well understood, these results suggest that antibodies targeting the membrane anchoring subunit of a class I viral fusion protein, e.g. S2 subunit of SARS-CoV, may also efficiently interfere the virus entry into host cells.",

Secondly, the absolute amounts of both the unbound anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs decrease during the depletion rounds but the decrement of the unbound anti-S1 is substantially larger than that of the unbound anti-S2 IgG after each depletion round (Fig. 3C, lower panel). It is also noted that the MFI of anti-N/AD293-S cells is significantly lower than that of anti-S1/ and anti-S2/AD293-S cells during the depletion rounds, and the absolute amount of anti-S1 and anit-S2 IgG is depleted at a considerably higher rate than that of anti-N IgG, demonstrating the depletion of IgG is S protein specific. These observations imply that: (1) anti-S1 IgG has a good binding capacity to m-S and therefore can be efficiently removed from the IgG pool after every binding-depleting cycle; and (2) binding of anti-S2 IgG to m-S protein, however, is restricted and hence the dynamic change of free anti-S2 IgG is different from that of anti-S1 and anti-N IgG in the process of depletion, characterized by a limited amount of anti-S2 IgG bound and removed in each depletion cycle and an abundant free IgG sustained a close value of MFI even after many round of depletion.",

Since the abolition of receptor binding to m-S protein by anti-S2 IgG is not reported previously, we further confirmed this phenomenon by repeating the binding assay with other ligand cells.

Moreover, the blocking efficiency of anti-S1 IgG was generally higher than that of anti-S2 IgG under the same tested concentration, although both IgGs showed complete blocking of receptor binding at about 10 mg/ml (Fig. 4C).

The specific binding between the S2-Ept peptide and anti-S2 IgG is demonstrated in Fig. 5\nA. The neutralizing titer of dep-anti-S2 IgG was found to decrease significantly (P\n < 0.05, \u2217) at various peptide concentrations. Such IgG depletion is demonstrated to be S2 specific as no significant decrease of neutralizing titer was observed in dep-anti-S1 IgG and the mock depleted anti-S2 IgG (data not shown). It is noted that antibodies against epitopes in S2-Ept was undetectable in dep-anti-S2 IgG but detectable in the mock depleted anti-S2 IgG using Western blots (data not shown), demonstrating that only a negligible amount of anti-S2-Ept antibodies is present in dep-anti-S2 IgG. In addition, according to the IgG quantification ELISA, no significant loss of total IgG was observed between the dep-anti-S2 IgG and the mock depleted anti-S2 IgG (data not shown) and indicating that the IgG against S2-Ept only contributes a negligible fraction of the total anti-S2 IgG population although it contributes significantly to virus neutralization. On the other hand, the blocking efficiency of mock depleted anti-S2 IgG and dep-anti-S2 IgG in the cell-based receptor binding assay were not significantly different (data not shown), implying anti-S2-Ept IgG may not play a major role in the blocking of receptor binding.",

This was mainly reported for SARS-CoV and even in our earlier studies [20] we failed to prove that anti-S2 antibodies have a neutralizing effect independent of anti-S1 antibodies. This was probably due to the low titer of the antisera used. In this study, high titered anti-S1 and anti-S2 antibodies were generated with DNA-prime-viral-booster immunization regimen in mice, allowing us to characterize the roles of the S1 and S2 subunits in virus docking and virus neutralization. Here, we demonstrated both anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs are able to neutralize the virus with significant difference in efficacy (Fig. 2A), which were not compared quantitatively in previous studies of other CoVs or other class I virus fusion proteins. In addition, the observed differences of neutralizing efficacies may be accounted, at least partially, by the antibody binding to m-S assay (Fig. 3), in which we showed that the binding capacities of m-S protein for anti-S1 IgG is significantly larger than that of anti-S2 IgG. The low antibody binding capacity of the S2 subunit (Fig. 3C) may be explained by the limited accessible surface for anti-S2 IgG, as it has a coiled-coil trimeric structure forming a compact short stalk which is hided under the globular S1 subunit and radially covered by oligosaccharides [33]. A similar finding on the steric constraints for antibody to access gp41, another class I virus fusion protein of HIV, was reported and discussed recently [34], [35].",

            "text": "Despite the widely reported neutralizing epitopes within the S2 subunit, the role of anti-S2 antibodies in virus neutralization remains unknown. Based on the existing viral entry model of CoVs [7], it is proposed that the virus docks to host cell surface through the binding between the globular S1 subunit and cellular receptor(s), then the stalk-like S2 subunit undergoes structural changes to initiate the fusion between viral envelope and host cell membrane, allowing the migration of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytosol. According to the previous studies of class I virus fusion proteins in other viruses [21], [36], [37], immediately after the receptor binding of their globular domains, the six-helix bundled HR regions of their membrane fusion subunits, i.e. S2 subunit in the case SARS-CoV, undergo dramatic conformational transition to expose its hydrophobic fusion peptide and mediates the subsequent virus\u2013cell fusion. However, no evidence was reported to relate these structural changes to the attachment and docking of these viruses. Interestingly, in our study, anti-S2 antibodies were demonstrated to be able to abolish the binding between S protein and its host cell in the cell-based receptor binding assay, implying the possible involvement of the S2 subunit in virus docking process. The unanticipated blocking ability of anti-S2 antibodies argues the current hypothesis that the S2 subunit only participates in membrane fusion but not virus docking. Therefore, we propose that successful docking or attachment of SARS-CoV may not solely rely on the receptor binding of S1 subunit but may also depend on actions involving the S2 subunit, which therefore can be blocked by anti-S2 IgG. To this end, we hypothesize two possible mechanisms to explain this observation. Firstly, we propose that the S2 subunit may participate in a global structural change of the spike which strengthens the binding or enhance the surface complementariness [38] between the receptor binding domain and its receptor. Alternatively speaking, the bound anti-S2 antibodies may stress the S1 subunit and prevent the receptor binding domain from forming a complementary surface with its receptor [38]. Secondly, binding between the S1 subunit and host receptor(s) may be reversible and the virus may fail to stably dock to the host cell surface without subsequent insertion of the fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. One other possible explanation is simply the bulkiness of the bound anti-S2 antibodies may hinder the spike from binding with its receptor.",

In addition, neutralizing antibodies targeting one of these regions have been found in sera of recovered SARS patients [17]. Using antigen specific antibody depletion assay, we demonstrated that the existence of neutralizing determinants within these regions as depletion of antibodies against these regions significantly diminished the neutralizing effects of anti-S2 IgG (Fig. 5B). However, the residual neutralizing effect of the dep-anti-S2 IgG implies these regions may not be the sole neutralizing determinants and suggests the presence of neutralizing epitopes within other regions of the S2 subunit, such as the recent report on monoclonal neutralizing antibody targeting the C-HR [13], [25]. It is noted that a similar depletion assay has been used to prove the existence neutralizing epitopes beyond the receptor binding domain of the SARS S1 subunit [39]. Furthermore, the blocking efficiency of dep-anti-S2 IgG was comparable to that of the mock depleted anti-S2 IgG, indicating these regions may not be involved in virus docking, and alternatively speaking, the neutralizing mechanism of these epitopes may not involve blocking of receptor binding. On the other hand, some neutralizing epitopes may only be exposed during the conformational change of S2 protein triggered by receptor binding since binding of anti-S2 IgG to m-S is nearly saturated in low range of IgG concentrations (Fig. 3B) but such saturation was not observed in neutralizing assay (Fig. 2A) and cell-based receptor binding assays (Fig. 4C). Although currently no neutralizing epitope was mapped to the C-terminal tail of the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV, neutralizing epitopes were mapped on the corresponding region of gp41 [40], implying the presence of possible functional roles of the regions other than the defined functional domains (e.g. HR and fusion peptide) in class I virus fusion proteins. The present experimental data suggests that there is no major neutralizing domain, like receptor binding domain of S1, on S2 protein.",

Although anti-S2 IgG neutralizes the virus less efficiently as compared with the anti-S1 IgG, the sequence conservation of S2 subunit across various strains, including the SARS-like CoV in civet [41] and bats [42], [43], and its additive neutralizing effects with anti-S1 antibody still make it a candidate for development of recombinant vaccines if the neutralizing efficiency can be greatly improved. Taken together with the results of the quantitative comparisons and the antigen specific antibody depletion assay, this study puts toward new understanding of the functional roles of the S2 subunit, hence the neutralizing mechanisms of anti-S2 antibodies, which would certainly provide valuable information for rational design of vaccines or antibody therapeutics against the virus.",
