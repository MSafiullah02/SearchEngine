One newborn was initially reported to be positive for COVID-19, but upon a second testing of the same sample, the authors changed the result to a false positive (22). Two additional papers (10, 20) reported newborns who tested negative for SARS CoV-2 by PCR but showed high levels of IgM and IgG. Dong and colleagues (10) reported a newborn who tested negative for SARS CoV-2, with IgM and IgG values > 10 AU/ml on the day of birth and 14 days later. Zeng and colleagues (20) reported a series of 6 newborns who were PCR negative for SARS CoV-2, with 5 having IgG values > 10 AU/ml and 2 also having IgM > 10AU/ml.",

Only 6 studies (6, 8, 9, 14, 17, 25) reported COVID-19-positive newborns (confirmed within 36 hours \u2013 17 days after delivery) and those found only 13 newborns positive of 222 exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen studies included results from suspected or confirmed pregnant women and their newborns at the time of birth (8, 14 and 17 included only newborns readmitted testing positive for SARS-CoV-2). From these studies, two cases reports (6, 9) and two case series reports (22, 25) reported newborns tested positive at 36 hours (6), 8 days (9), 2 and 4 days (25) after birth; one newborn reported by Liu and colleagues (22) was classified as false positive. Two papers (10, 20) that reported elevated values of IgM and IgG were not consistent enough to support in-utero transmission; they lacked confirmatory results from maternal or newborn samples, e.g., amniotic fluid or infant\u2019s PCR. Even when one study (10) may contribute to suspecting mother-to-child transmission, the evidence is not conclusive (26). Some newborns were positive for COVID-19 in spite of the reported use of preventive measures during and after delivery (6, 8, 9, 22, 25), but even in these cases there was no evidence supporting vertical transmission.",
