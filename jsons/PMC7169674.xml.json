Kundan) was done on December 18 2008 through drilling, with a row\u2010to\u2010row distance of 20 cm and a spot\u2010to\u2010spot distance of 15 cm. The Kundan variety is a high\u2010yielding (4.0\u20134.5 t ha\u22121), semidwarf variety of wheat. Its life cycle continues for \u2264125\u2013130 days after sowing (DAS). These fields had been subjected to the same treatments, as described below, for the past 12 years and followed a rice\u2013wheat\u2013fallow crop rotation. The fertilizer application of NPK followed the regional practices. The basal treatments of KCl and P2O5 were applied at the rate of 80 and 40 kg ha\u22121, respectively, P2O5 being applied in the form of single superphosphate and KCl being applied in the form of potash at the time of sowing. Nitrogen was applied as urea at the rate of 120 kg N ha\u22121 in three split doses. The first dose of urea (40 kg N ha\u22121) was applied at the time of sowing; other two doses (40 kg N ha\u22121), were applied as top dressing during the active tillering (30 DAS), and flowering stages (60 DAS) of wheat, respectively. In order to avoid water shortages until harvest, the plots were surface\u2010irrigated weekly. The weeds were allowed to develop in the wheat plots without physical and chemical control.",

Species within the same group were similar in terms of their morphology, as well as physiology, and adopted similar strategies for growth and reproduction. Taller weeds, such as C. album and P. minor, constituted one group along with the crop, having a low A, SLA, LNCm, chlorophyll, PNUE and LAR in comparison to the shorter weeds, such as A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus, which formed another group with a high A, SLA, LNCm, chlorophyll, PNUE and LAR. This might be related to their shorter life span compared to taller weeds, which emerge with the crop (Om et al. 2004; Singh 2012) and continue till crop harvest. Although the shorter weeds emerge later in the season and complete their life cycle early, for their survival they have to face intense competition from the crop and taller weeds, particularly for light. Therefore, a high SLA, PNUE, LNCm and other supporting traits ensure their survival. Besides this, these traits also provide the smaller weeds with a benefit during light competition. Although being tall is beneficial for light competition, it demands a cost for plants. According to Nagashima and Hikosaka (2011), as the plant's height increases, its need to invest biomass more than proportionately in the stem to support its own weight increases, which in turn reduces the fraction of leaf mass in the plant and thus C gain. However, a smaller plant increases its biomass allocation to the green parts and increases its SLA and other leaf traits, which results in increased light acquisition efficiency (intercepted photon flux per unit aboveground mass) (Kamiyama et al. 2010).",

            "text": "The direct and indirect effects of the SLA, LAR, LMR and leaf chlorophyll content on the photosynthesis of the two identified groups, as derived from a path analysis, are shown in Figure 3. The study indicates that the SLA and LAR together were able to influence photosynthesis in the group 1 species (A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus), which had a high SLA, leaf N and chlorophyll content. However, the LMR, by modulating the chlorophyll content, influenced the photosynthesis of the group 2 species (C. album, P. minor and wheat), which had a low SLA, leaf N and chlorophyll content. Any change in the SLA relates to actual changes in the leaf structure and chemical composition. A lower SLA could be associated with slower intercellular diffusion of CO2 (Parkhurst 1994; Hikosaka et al. 1998; Poorter & Evans 1998) or with greater internal shading of chloroplasts by attenuating photons passing through the lamina (Terashima & Hikosaka 1995), either of which could decrease the A of a leaf. The SLA is also associated with N allocation to photosynthesis (Poorter & Evans 1998). The N allocation to carboxylation and bioenergetics increases with an increasing SLA (Hikosaka et al. 1998; Onoda et al. 2004). Hikosaka et al. (1998) also found that the SLA is positively correlated with the fraction of leaf N in ribulose\u20101,5\u2010bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO), a key enzyme of photosynthesis. This is because of the fact that \u223c60% of the leaf soluble proteins consist of RuBisCO, which is often regarded as the most limiting factor for biomass production (Evans & Seemann 1989; Takashima et al. 2004). Other studies also demonstrate that increasing leaf N parallels increasing investment in photosynthetic compounds (thylakoid proteins, enzymes of the Calvin cycle (Onoda et al. 2004; Takashima et al. 2004; Harrison et al. 2009; Hikosaka & Shigeno 2009).",

Considering all the species, the SLA, chlorophyll and LNCm were positively correlated with A (Fig. 4). High\u2010SLA species might allocate a lower fraction of leaf N to cell walls, leaving more N for photosynthesis, as compared with low\u2010SLA species, and have a higher PNUE (Poorter & Evans 1998). This is evident by the fact that the high\u2010SLA species in this study had a high PNUE (R\n2 = 0.96, P = 0.002). Similarly to the present study, A has been positively correlated with LNCm and SLA in many studies (Poorter et al. 1990; Hikosaka 2010). According to Reich et al. (1999), these patterns are common to all species because significant N per unit mass accumulation would be required in the leaves to achieve a high A.",

In this study, the LAR and SLA were positively related (R\n2 = 0.56, P = 0.08). According to Storkey (2005), at the lower light levels early in the season, species with a high SLA have a high RGR. As the light intensity increases, however, it becomes more advantageous to have a lower SLA to increase the capacity of individual leaves to absorb light. This will be more important for the taller species and there appears to be a general trade\u2010off between plant height later in the season and the SLA (Storkey 2005). This also was observed in the study, as the taller weeds (C. album and P. minor) and the crop (wheat) had a low SLA later in the season. Plants with internodes, such as Chenopodium and many grasses, have been shown to display a very rapid (within minutes) increase in the rate of elongation growth of the stems after initiation of a simulated shade treatment (see references in Mart\u00ednez\u2010Garc\u00eda et al. 2010). These alterations are accompanied by changes, including a reduced chlorophyll content, hyponastic leaves, increase in apical dominance (leading to reduced branching in dicots and tillering in grasses) and acceleration of flowering (Casal et al. 1990; Kebrom & Brutnell 2007). Also in this study, C. album, P. minor and wheat had a lower chlorophyll content, compared to A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus.",

The shorter weeds (A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus) in this study had a relatively high SLA. The plants with a high RGR tended to have a high NAR and LAR. However, in this study, the NAR and LAR were negatively correlated (Fig. 5). The variation in the LAR was related mainly to the variation in the SLA and, to a lesser extent, to that of the LMR. This negative correlation between the LAR and the NAR might be related to the negative correlation between the NAR and the SLA (Villar et al. 1998). An inverse relationship between the LAR and the NAR also was reported by Poorter and Remkes (1990) and Meziane and Shipley (1999).",
