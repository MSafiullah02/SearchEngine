And several successes have been recorded in finding new actives in natural products, some of which have become new drugs or new sources of inspiration for drugs. But in view of the vast amount of research on the subject, it is surprising that not more drug candidates were found. In our view, it is fundamental to reflect upon the approaches of such drug discovery programs and the technical processes that are used, along with their inherent difficulties and biases. Based on an extensive survey of recent publications, we discuss the origin and the variety of natural chemical diversity as well as the strategies to having the potential to embrace this diversity. It seemed to us that some of the difficulties of the area could be related with the technical approaches that are used, so the present review begins with synthetizing some of the more used discovery strategies, exemplifying some key points, in order to address some of their limitations. It appears that one of the challenges of natural product-based drug discovery programs should be an easier access to renewable sources of plant-derived products. Maximizing the use of the data together with the exploration of chemical diversity while working on reasonable supply of natural product-based entities could be a way to answer this challenge. We suggested alternative ways to access and explore part of this chemical diversity with in vitro cultures. We also reinforced how important it was organizing and making available this worldwide knowledge in an \"inventory\" of natural products and their sources. And finally, we focused on strategies based on synthetic biology and syntheses that allow reaching industrial scale supply. Approaches based on the opportunities lying in untapped natural plant chemical diversity are also considered.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Several reviews, like the updated survey from Newman and Cragg (2016) , pointed to the fact that many drugs on the market are from natural origin; these authors stated that, out of the 1,328 new chemical entities approved as drugs between 1981 and 2016, only 359 were purely of synthetic origin. From the remaining ones, 326 were \"biological\" entities (peptides of more than 50 residues, including therapeutic antibodies), and 94 were vaccines. A little less than half of those new drugs (549, exactly) were from natural origin or derived inspired from natural compounds. Furthermore, in the anticancer area, out of the 136 approved nonbiological compounds from the same period , only 23 were purely synthetic (i.e. not derived from natural compounds nor natural compounds themselves) (Newman and Cragg, 2016) . Natural origin can have different definitions, and these authors accounted for three categories: unaltered natural (pure) products; defined mixture of natural products (NP) and natural product derivatives isolated from plants or other living organisms as fungi, sponges, lichens, or microorganisms; and products modified by medicinal chemistry. There are many examples: anticancer drugs such as docetaxel (Taxotere\u2122), paclitaxel (Taxol\u2122), vinblastine, podophyllotoxin (Condylin\u2122), or etoposide; steroidal hormones such as progesterone, norgestrel, or cortisone; cardiac glycosides such as digitoxigenin; antibiotics like penicillin, streptomycin, and cephalosporins [see IA Ross for more examples (1999) ]. Furthermore, Rodrigues et al. (2016) pointed to the fact that fragments derived from natural structures are a source of diverse molecules from which new drugs can be designed, thanks to the fragment-based drug discovery approach (Erlanson et al., 2016; Mortenson et al., 2018; Y\u00f1igez-Gutierrez and Bachmann, 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 46, "end": 69, "text": "Newman and Cragg (2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 785, "end": 809, "text": "(Newman and Cragg, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1515, "text": "Ross for more examples (1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1555, "text": "Rodrigues et al.

Vast libraries of compounds have been established in order to feed the research. For example, in midsize pharmaceutical companies, it is common to find libraries from 30,000 up to 500,000 compounds, while for big pharmas, the numbers are more in the 500,000 to several million ranges (Macarron et al., 2011) . To our knowledge this is also the case for the National Chinese Compound Library in Shanghai, China (http://en.cncl.org.cn/). Finally, national or transnational efforts have been reported to create such depositories of compounds for the use of screening programs from the Academy: see Horvath et al. (2014) in Europe and Thornburg et al. (2018) for the NIH/NCI effort. In addition, vendors are also selling libraries of compounds composed of a \"large\" diversity that they build according to different principles (Boss et al., 2017) . Several publications deal with how the compounds are chosen (Langer et al., 2009) , if they are following Lipinski rules (Lipinski et al., 2001; Lipinski, 2003) or not, if they are virtual (Glaab, 2016) or real, if they are systematically tested on all the targets, how they can be organized in subclasses of compounds designed to potentially interact with channels, receptors, or enzymes, etc. Furthermore, the composition of the library in relation with the main categories of molecules-small synthetic compounds, drug-like organic compounds, peptides, proteins, sugars, nucleosides, or natural compounds-can greatly vary in function of the \"Pharma company culture\", that is to say, the compounds that have already been synthesized in a given company as well as the \"sensitivity\" of the medicinal chemists and screening people.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 418, "end": 441, "text": "(Macarron et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 729, "end": 750, "text": "Horvath et al.

Modern pharmacology has explored and validated probably only a minor part of this knowledge through attempts of rationalizing the use of plants as sources of drugs. This first possible approach would be a way to guide some drug discovery projects. Another totally different approach based on the use of high-throughput screening (HTS) emerged one or two decades ago. It aimed at exploring systematically the immense chemical diversity in secondary metabolites and was based on the technological developments of discovery tools such as miniaturization and automation (Atanasov et al., 2015) . In this sense, the increase of the amount of compounds was tested simultaneously, and the scientific rationalization of the selection of those compounds, thanks to the growing capacities of chemoinformatic approaches (Larsson et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 2007) , emerged as trends in HTS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 941, "end": 964, "text": "(Atanasov et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1206, "text": "(Larsson et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1228, "text": "Larsson et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF219"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Screening for New Drugs and Discovery Approaches"}, {"text": "When reviewing the literature on how discovery of plant-derived actives is performed, the following pattern emerges (Weller, 2012; Gupta, 2015, Heinrich et al., 2018) . Plants are collected in precise geo-localized sites. The collection may include the whole plant or any part such as leaves, stems, bark, seeds, or roots. Then, the botanical material is dried and powdered using mechanical means, such as grounders. Those powders are then extracted with solvents at different temperatures or of increasing polarities with sequential extraction procedures in the cases when, for example, the chemistry of the active compounds is unknown. These first steps are important to consider as the extraction method might influence the chemical composition of the extract and consequently, its biological activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 130, "text": "(Weller, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF451"}, {"start": 131, "end": 166, "text": "Gupta, 2015, Heinrich et al., 2018)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strategies for Identification of Bioactive Compounds From Crude Extracts"}, {"text": "Then, the extracts are dried under low pressure, and the final solid residue is suspended in a solution comprising the minimal amount of a biological-compatible solvent, often DMSO. The next steps would include the testing of the extracts in 96 (or 384) well plates against the biological targets of the program. These biological tests are often a cloned enzyme catalytic assay, a receptor binding assay, a protein-protein interaction assay or even a whole pathway (Ishibashi and Ohtsuki, 2008; Xie et al., 2018) , to name but a few. Biological testing targeting whole-cells was also reported against cancer cells (Mazzio et al., 2014; Kant et al., 2016) , virus-infected cells (Yi et al., 2004; Dai et al., 2012) , or microorganisms (Correia et al., 2008; Figueroa-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; St-Pierre et al., 2018) . Extracts showing activity on those tests are selected and submitted to fractionation by chromatography. Each fraction (typically around ten) will be tested in turn in the same assay, and the active fractions are subjected to one or several extra fractionations, often using alternative chromatographic conditions. Some of these experiments are based on an HTS environment. HTS methodologies provided us with impressive progresses in terms of increased speed of assay and lowering of price. Indeed, robots can handle several thousands of tests during a workday. However, the initial enthusiasm for HTS (Harvey and Cree, 2010; Sarker and Nahar, 2012) when applied to crude extract libraries in targeted assays systems has been facing several issues as stated recently by Thornburg et al. (2018) . In fact, HTS techniques do not really modify the discovery process itself. For example, starting with 2,000 extracts-which is a modest number considering (a) the number of plants species available and (b) the number of compounds in an HTS campaign-might result into 10% actives, in the best case. Thus, the next step would be 200 hydrophobic columns, with the collection of about 10 fractions per chromatography, and then 2,000 tests. As exemplified, the real bottleneck in this whole process is the parallel fractionations of the actives; as of today, only partial progresses in their automatization have been reported over the last years (Sharma and Gupta, 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 465, "end": 494, "text": "(Ishibashi and Ohtsuki, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 495, "end": 512, "text": "Xie et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF461"}, {"start": 614, "end": 635, "text": "(Mazzio et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 636, "end": 654, "text": "Kant et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 678, "end": 695, "text": "(Yi et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF478"}, {"start": 696, "end": 713, "text": "Dai et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 734, "end": 756, "text": "(Correia et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 757, "end": 785, "text": "Figueroa-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 786, "end": 809, "text": "St-Pierre et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF405"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1436, "text": "(Harvey and Cree, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1460, "text": "Sarker and Nahar, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF376"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1604, "text": "Thornburg et al.

The group of metabolic profiling approaches has a more detached relationship with bioactivity as they are not focused on compounds.

The probability still exists that a plant collected on a given location would not be there the next time around, especially the whole plant.

In those cases, two choices are possible: to look for this species in another location or to look in the same location for a closely related species with the help of botanists. Neither solution is entirely satisfactory: the change of harvest location can imply change(s) in secondary metabolite production as their biosynthesis generally depends on the control by both biotic and abiotic factors. Furthermore, the other species of the same genus might very well express different genes coding for proteins acting slightly differently in biosynthetical pathways leading to different compounds or to the same compounds synthetized in different proportions (see below for discussion on diversity). Moreover, if the collected species are not properly reported following the correct taxonomy, the harvest might be even more difficult to reproduce: thereby, a table of correspondence between the names mentioned in this review (and used in the articles of origin) and the accepted plant species names is provided in the supplementary data (Table S1) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1440, "end": 1450, "text": "(Table S1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Successes and Limitations"}, {"text": "Another type of limitation is related with the fact that groups performing bioguided discovery of new actives are often confronted with similar problems: (a) the active extracts, once fractionated, do not maintain the level of activity; (b) the whole long and difficult isolation process leads to a molecule that is mundane or known for decades; (c) the final product quantity in the remaining active fraction is too small to hope for a structure elucidation; (d) going back to the location of origin, the same plant population is not found anymore or if the plant is found, the same extraction treatment led to an apparent lack of active fraction(s) on the same target.

The fact that the targeted disease is obviously more complex than the molecular target it has been simplified to, is universally recognized, but alternative approaches remain elusive or still difficult to set up. For example, the disease could also be simplified by a phenotypic change of a cell originating from a diseased organ using the stem cell differentiation approaches (Bedut et al., 2016) . After treating such a model with NP extracts -having potentially hundreds of compounds-reverse pharmacology should allow recognizing the actual target of the NP compound as the lysed cell extract is chromatographed to retain the target proteins (Raut et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, cellular phenotypic changes are extremely complex to understand, and this approach has been more than once extremely frustrating despite some successes, outside of the NP recognition area (Nosjean et al., 2000; Graves et al., 2002) . Actually, another limitation of this approach is linked with working with complex mixtures in NP discovery as sometimes several compounds could contribute synergistically to the global action on a disease: like for example the compounds (at least three of them) derived from leaves of Salvia miltiorrhiza (red sage) that are reported to act at many different levels of liver fibrosis (Ma et al., 2019) . This kind of observation would strongly argue against the strategy described in here aiming at the discovery of the main pure drug-like compound in a plant extract.

That is to say, that in order to benefit patients, critical amounts of a potential drug need to be considered, and the access to the identified NP as well as its availability are critical. For example, at the start of the Taxol\u2122 story, the compound was isolated from Taxus brevifolia bark. Ten kilograms of bark was necessary to obtain 2 g of the pure compound needed for the treatment of one patient. For the clinical study, 12,000 trees were cut down to obtain the 2 kg necessary for the studies leading to the approval of the compound. In fact, the antineoplastic Taxotere\u2122 is now produced by hemi-synthesis from the precursor 10-deacetylbaccatine III, which is isolated from leaves of Taxus baccata.

Another interesting figure dealing this time with herbals is the annual demand of ginseng roots around 50,000 tons (Mathur et al., 1999) .

Nevertheless, many progresses have been done in this area: in relation with structural characterization, for example, considering the growing sensitivity of the analytical methods and instruments, it will not be long until the barrier of the microgram for the determination of the structure of a compound would be reached. The analytical techniques for structural elucidation of an unknown compound are based on a mixture of spectroscopy (infrared, UV, Raman), mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (proton and C 13 NMR).

Advances in NMR techniques were reviewed (Breton and Reynolds, 2013; Harvey et al., 2015; Gomes et al., 2018) , and several examples of compounds for which structures were solved with mass of pure compounds lower than 100 \u00b5g were reported. In fact, the situation could be different from one plant to another or from one organ/tissue to another, even in a single plant species. Therefore, even if we can identify the many compounds in each sample while being able to establish their structure, it would be more straightforward to consider the feasibility of the systematic compendium of all the plant chemical components.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 876, "end": 896, "text": "(Baker et al., 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 897, "end": 920, "text": "El-Elimat et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 962, "end": 976, "text": "Amagata (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1047, "text": "(Breton and Reynolds, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1068, "text": "Harvey et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1088, "text": "Gomes et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations Related to the Need of Market-Compatible Amounts"}, {"text": "A careful understanding of the metabolic pathways of the tissues of the plant species from which the product has been isolated is also necessary.

The complexity of a molecule increases with the size and the atom connectivity. As a result, the more complex they are, the greater the number of molecules one should screen. Statistical analyses have been performed on natural products to study their chemical diversity (Firn and Jones, 2003; Hong, 2011) , molecular properties (Feher and Schmidt, 2003; Quinn et al., 2008) , scaffold diversity (Lee and Schneider, 2001; Grabowski et al., 2008; Yongye et al., 2012) , and coverage of the chemical space (Ros\u00e9n et al., 2009a) .

In addition, these compound libraries are required to be constantly enriched with compounds filling the gaps in the molecular space. Interestingly, Harvey et al. (2015) stated: \"diversity within biologically relevant chemical space is more important than library size\", this biologically relevant chemical space being defined by proteinbinding sites for potential ligands. Another point emphasized by these authors is that while the commercially available chemical space is wider than the explored natural product universe-the first one is evaluated to 5.10 9 compounds, while the second only represents 3.10 5 compounds (Banerjee et al., 2015) -NP are intrinsically more diverse. A major component of this comparison is that NP are more complex, from a chemical point of view, leading to greater shape diversity. However, NP might not be the best compounds to screen in HTS campaigns due to their complexity (\"best\" in a drug-discovery perspective). Indeed, their probability of being active on a random target is lower, and their chemical tractability is far from optimal.

In summary, the main idea is that if compounds as chemically diverse as possible are necessary to feed drug discovery programs, then a great deal of efforts should still be invested in the exploration of natural chemical diversity because, in this particular context, natural chemistry is more advanced than organic chemistry.

Among the 240 papers that were reviewed, a handful described compounds isolated from venoms and toxins originating from marine organisms and animals (insects, snakes, and alike). Then, a few other papers described compounds coming from microorganisms as can be seen in Table 2 . Microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, were traditionally important sources of antibiotics and are still a source of new peptides (Xue et al., 2018) , but here compounds other than peptides can also be found that are close to secondary metabolites naturally synthesized in those cells. New peptides are more often described in journals specialized in peptide chemistry and pharmacology, even if their source is a living organism. Table 3 gives examples of compounds isolated from lichen, fungi, and sponges. The chemical diversity of these compounds is interesting but, as of today, growing lichen or sponges is not so much reported and might turn out to be difficult on a larger scale.

It seems that in both cases, most of the studies are done on leaves. On the other hand, it is not clear, on a systematic basis, if what was found in the other organs can be found as well-even in small quantities-in the leaves. Nevertheless, leaves are the most accessible part of any plant, and they are renewable which allows preserving the whole plant.

Astonishingly, those recipes were collected from scattered geographic places. This last observation suggests that traditional medicines around the world independently found similar remedies to similar diseases and sometimes with the use of related plant species. Another interesting source of intraspecific chemical diversity is the environment of the plant cells biosynthesizing the chemical compounds of interest: it is well known that compounds produced by the same plant species can vary in nature or quantity depending on the environment (localization or time of the year) or the part of the plant where it has been extracted from. Moore et al. (2014) pointed out in particular the plant ontogeny, but also genetic and environmental variations as major sources of diversity for plant secondary metabolites. The existence of chemotypes is another example of this intraspecific chemo-diversity well described for example in plants producing essential oils. Factors like moisture, salinity, temperature, or nutrition levels are known to influence the essential oil production (Sangwan et al., 2001) , and the genotype could also significantly influence the chemotype as it was shown recently for Valeriana jatamansi Jones . The biosynthesis of natural products can also differ in function of the different individuals from the same population. It is the case, for example, when these compounds are related to antimicrobial activity as summarized by Bednarek and Osbourn (2009) in their perspective article on chemical diversity linked with plant defense: these compounds can be synthetized constitutively as part of normal plant development-and stored in specialized tissues-or synthetized in response to pathogenic challenges through the activation of the transcription of specific genes of the corresponding biosynthetic pathways.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 20, "end": 32, "text": "(Ross, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF363"}, {"start": 33, "end": 44, "text": "Ross, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 963, "end": 982, "text": "Moore et al.

But it is not only the global absolute value of chemically diverse compounds that is interesting. Such diversity and such dynamicity are indeed a wonderful wealth of chemical structures, source of inspiration for medicinal chemist, once the structure is carefully identified, and the related pharmacological activity is screened. But it can also become a source of complexity for the phytochemist working on the structure or on the structure/activity relation. Classically, within this chemical diversity in plant secondary metabolites, the nomenclature used by pharmacologists to attempt classifying several families of natural compounds such as polyketides, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, steroids, or alkaloids is based more on their biogenesis and the pathway they originate from (acetate, shikimate, mevalonate or methylerythritol phosphate pathways) or their combination, than their structure itself. And even within a defined group, the diversity can be impressive: for example, the terpenoid family is suspected to contain at least 50,000 different molecules (Kirby and Keasling, 2009 ) while at least 12,000 flavonoids have been described (Henz Ryen and Backlund, 2019).

This is not really surprising when considering that 83% of core ring scaffolds shown in natural products cannot be found in libraries of synthetic compounds (Harvey et al., 2015) . It should be reminded that part of the interest in \"discovering\" such structures, if they have any biological activities, resides in our capacity to use medicinal chemistry to translate such complex structures in simpler molecules amenable to the industrial production. At the same time, those structures might bear activity towards proteins, the inhibition of which has not been reached yet, with our current access to chemical synthons. This has been reported and discussed according to two points of view: (a) the natural compound-derived fragments (Rodrigues et al., 2016) and (b) the list of compounds issued from natural skeletons: what Newman and Cragg (2016) called NP derivatives in which 268 out of 1,328 new drugs can be found. Among the classical examples, there are vincristine and vinblastine as part of vinca-alkaloids (Zhou and Rahmani, 1992) , statins (Sirtori, 2014) , glifozins (Burson and Moran, 2015) , and ingenol mebutate (Alchin, 2014) . It should be reminded here that the current process is moving more from \"simple\" hits-from whatever origin-to more complex molecules by means of medicinal chemistry decoration of these (Ross, 1999; Ross, 2001 synthons. The process of lead hopping, as defined by Krueger et al. (2009) and Chakka et al. (2017) , should theoretically permit to mimic one complex structure by another, simpler one. All this body of techniques and theories should be put together at work in order to gain new powerful compounds from new, NP-based approaches (Y\u00f1igez-Gutierrez and Bachmann, 2019). In fact, a survey of the data indicates two important features of NP, on the basis of this selection: 1/compounds are very diverse even if they include some common features (like for instance the particular cycloheptanic structure found in some of the main compounds from Euphorbia-see Figure 4 ) and 2/the high number of asymmetric carbons render their synthesis by standard organic chemistry difficult if not impossible. For instance, some examples of those numbers are given in Table 5 . Considering that the number of theoretically possible isomers is 2 n , n being the number of asymmetric carbons, in some cases, the total number of possible isomers is in the several thousand ranges (see numbers in Table 5 ).

Examples are scattered in the literature with in vitro cultures producing compounds of interest either using dedifferentiated cells from callus or undifferentiated cells from meristematic cambial cells. From the calli, systems of plant suspension cell cultures can be generated like for example for acteoside production from Scrophularia stiata (Khanpour-Ardestani et al., 2015) , rosmarinic acid from Satureja khuzistanica (Sahraroo et al., 2014) , or carotenoid from Tagetes erecta (Ben\u00edtez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014) . On the other hand, tissue cultures (i.e. hairy roots) can also be developed from already differentiated cells. All these types of culture are generally developed for a particular purpose, often very restricted to a given compound in a given plant, such as for camptothecin production by Ophiorrhiza species (Asano et al., 2009) , Schisandra chinensis lignans production (Szopa et al., 2017; Szopa et al., 2018) or boeravinone Y by Abronia nana . Several examples of cultures at a commercial scale have also been described validating its feasibility and scalability from lab-scale to large-scale (paclitaxel form Taxus spp. cultures, rosmarinic acid from Coleus blumei cultures, scopolamine from Duboisia spp. cultures (Wilson and Roberts, 2012) to name only but a few).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 229, "text": "(Wilson and Roberts, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF453"}, {"start": 230, "end": 255, "text": "Moscatiello et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF288"}, {"start": 256, "end": 286, "text": "Ochoa-Villarreal et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF325"}, {"start": 287, "end": 305, "text": "Eibl et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 653, "end": 686, "text": "(Khanpour-Ardestani et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 732, "end": 755, "text": "(Sahraroo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF370"}, {"start": 792, "end": 821, "text": "(Ben\u00edtez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1151, "text": "(Asano et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1214, "text": "(Szopa et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF411"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1234, "text": "Szopa et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF412"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1568, "text": "(Wilson and Roberts, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF453"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO BENEFIT FROM THIS DIVERSITY"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, if the literature provides us with some very welldescribed examples of such tasks, it remains to be seen if these techniques are universal. In other words, what has been described to be possible to obtain a \"large scale\" plant cell culture is not necessarily applicable to the next cell culture of a different plant, and a fortiori, of a different organ of the same plant species. What has been considered as a promising approach remains in some cases a challenge, as no experimental process has been developed-or published-with a general usage purpose. Thus, the perfectly described process to obtain stem-derived callus or leaf-derived callus producing anticancer phenolic compounds from Fagonia indica (Khan et al., 2016) is only partially similar to the process to obtain callus from fruit pulp of varieties of apple producing high triterpenic acids (Verardo et al., 2017) or the process to obtain callus originating from seeds of Abronia nana (Kim et al., 2014) , a desert plant found in North America to produce massive amount of boeravinone Y or even callus from Scrophularia striata for the production of acteoside (Khanpour-Ardestani et al., 2015) . As seen above, many examples can be found in the literature, but the remaining question is how much the methodology varied from one example to the next in order to obtain such callus and then to obtain such cell suspensions producing the desired compound. Some general procedures for the establishment of dedifferentiated plant cell suspension cultures exist (Mustafa et al., 2011; Eibl et al., 2018) but with many specific adaptations in the function of species, organs of origins, and culture conditions. Probably because the authors concentrated mainly on the productivity and yield of the targeted compound and not on a larger picture applicable to a more general view of accessing and testing the chemical diversity of plants. If one considers the natural diversity lying in the plant species from our environment as a source of \"new\" chemicals, it would be wonderful to rely on a methodology universal enough to collect the biological material just once (or a very few times) and then, to rationalize the culture of the cells originating from the specific plant organ (leaves, stems, roots, etc.). The interest on these cell cultures is that the cells would be able to biosynthesize a large variety of compounds in quantities large enough to isolate and identify compounds with pharmacological activity and completely characterize them. At that stage, the culture size can be customized by expanding from several liters to several tens of liters of cell culture (hundreds if the initial results are promising and more biomass is needed to go on with testing). Finally, even modifications of culture conditions could work at enhancing chemical diversity (Jozwiak et al., 2013) or at least variations within the proportions of different secondary metabolites (Jozwiak et al., 2013; Akbari et al., 2018; Saad et al., 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 738, "text": "(Khan et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 868, "end": 890, "text": "(Verardo et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF432"}, {"start": 962, "end": 980, "text": "(Kim et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1170, "text": "(Khanpour-Ardestani et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1554, "text": "(Mustafa et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF292"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1573, "text": "Eibl et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 2832, "end": 2854, "text": "(Jozwiak et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 2936, "end": 2958, "text": "(Jozwiak et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 2959, "end": 2979, "text": "Akbari et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2998, "text": "Saad et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF369"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO BENEFIT FROM THIS DIVERSITY"}, {"text": "The originality of our approach thus resides in using plant tissue and cell culture not for the production scale for which some limitations exist but to attempt facilitating the access to plant chemical diversity.

On the contrary, a systematic \"inventory\" of the NP existing in living organisms, in plant parts for example, would be of great interest both for the drug discovery aspects as well as the development aspects, for the discovery aspects because it would allow a better use of the known natural chemical diversity and for the drug development aspects, because it would allow to change the sourcing of the NP keeping in mind how important the supply of the compound of natural origin is for a company. Tables 2-4 which consist in a sampling of recently reported works on natural compounds, this \"Systematism\" is already used by a few groups who catalogued the chemical compounds in a given organ of a given plant (Batista et al., 2017; Sendker et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2018) , in a fungus (Chang et al., 2017) , or in a microorganism (McMullin et al., 2017; Verastegui-Omana et al., 2017) . In such cases, an idea of the possible diversity of those sources is given. A compendium of some plant compositions had been done by I.A. Ross (Ross, 1999; Ross, 2001) . Such inventory organized in a global database would greatly facilitate the access to the diversity of secondary metabolites of plants, for example. It would somewhat ease any strategy based on chemotaxonomy by describing better the filiations/relationships between the biosynthetical pathways in a different genus and by facilitating the access to some types of chemical skeletons in renewable naturally producing sources such as leaves or fruits. Furthermore, Table 4 indicates, in our view, the way the literature can be compiled from all the available sources to build a database based only on published articles describing one or several compounds from plant parts. In this line, the remarkable paper of Solyomv\u00e1ry et al.

Indeed, it is the completion of such a compendium that is the real challenge, and the experience of the few already existing NP databases exemplifies that challenge. For example the NAPRALERT experience (https://napralert.org) gathering data from more than 200,000 scientific papers is very informative: comprehensive coverage is claimed from 1975 to 2004 while only 20% of the global data is covered from 2005 due to budgetary constraints. Organisms, compounds, activities, or authors can be searched. In fact, the last decade has seen the development of several databases providing systematic collection of information that focuses on natural compounds themselves, offering the possibility of searching structure, source, and mechanisms of action of the searched compounds. For example, DEREP-NP is a database that compiles structural data (Zani and Carroll, 2017 ). An interesting review from Xie et al. (2015) allows the comparison of fourteen of these databases focusing on NP, balancing their advantages and disadvantages. Among them, the updated version of a 2006 database SuperNatural II is a public resource (http://bioinformatics.charite. de/supernatural) with more than 325,500 natural compounds, offering 3D structure and conformers (Banerjee et al., 2015) which seems to outperform many others (Harvey et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2015) .

These reviews cited a large range of applications from the pharmaceutical area (suspension cells of Pacific yew in 75m 3 stirred bioreactors delivering 500kg/ year of paclitaxel) to the cosmetic and food industries like cell cultures of Malus domestica grown in 50 to 100 L production bioreactors.

Several solutions to try to avoid these kinds of limitation can be assessed (Trosset and Carbonell, 2015) , but in our opinion, general strategies should consider other alternatives for the large industrial production scale depending on the kind of applications. For some specific NP of pharmacological interest like podophyllotoxin, artemisinin or plumbagin for example, a whole set of biotechnological approaches has been developed and described for the production at larger scale of these valuable compounds (Lauti\u00e9 et al., 2010; Kayani et al., 2018; Roy and Bharadvaja, 2018) .

Within this last approach, the focus in plants is more on their capacity to synthetize unique scaffolds than on the end-products themselves. Indeed, the use of the recent integrative approaches based on \"Omic\" analyses (metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomic, and genomics) can be of great value. Indeed, knowing the precursors and intermediates through the biochemical status of a tissue, identifying the key enzymes and the limiting steps of the pathways, monitoring indirectly the function of the genes involved in these pathways and their regulation will contribute to decipher the biosynthetic routes in planta (Cheallaigh et al., 2018; Scossa et al., 2018) . The relative ease at which one can now obtain large-scale data has facilitated the analyses at the level of the whole metabolic network (Paddon and Keasling, 2014; Ikram and Simonsen, 2017) . For example, large amounts of transcriptomic data are now easier to access as stated by Owen et al. (2017) , making possible the identification of multistep pathways by coexpression analyses or untargeted metabolomics. Furthermore, the discovery that genes linked to biosynthetic pathways are organized in clusters has opened new opportunities by adapting methodologies developed initially for microorganisms to plants like systematic cluster mining algorithms (Owen et al., 2017) . Scossa et al. (2018) reviewed recently the progresses made in the understanding of plant biosynthetic pathways with the integration of metabolomics and next-generation sequencing based on various families of compounds: for example, benzoisoquinoline and monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, cannabinoids, ginsenosides, or withanolides. They also emphasized the new insight that this area can bring in the field of synthesis of NP. They mention for example, the intriguing case of caffeine biosynthesis that evolved independently in several orders of eudicots: at least three metabolic pathways evolved separately coopting genes from different gene families illustrating how biosynthetic pathways can evolve with land plant diversification (Scossa et al., 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 858, "end": 883, "text": "(Cheallaigh et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 884, "end": 904, "text": "Scossa et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF383"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1070, "text": "(Paddon and Keasling, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF333"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1096, "text": "Ikram and Simonsen, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1205, "text": "Owen et al.

Microbial hosts are generally considered more amenable than plants to fermentation process (Atanasov et al., 2015) . Among them, classical work horses like E. coli or S. cerevisiae, or newcomers like Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putidaare (Nikel et al., 2014; Loeschcke and Thies, 2015; Choi and Lee, 2020) can be cited. Another interesting example is the recent high-cell-density fermentation strategies developed for heterologous production in Pichia pastoris (W.-C. .

This kind of tool would incredibly ease the access to plant natural chemical diversity and should ideally be comprehensive, organized and include data from worldwide plant species, from past to recent studies. Such a globalized database could furthermore be integrated to other ones like genomic, phylogenic, species occurrence, biosynthetic pathway, biological activity, or chemical classification (Allen et al., 2019) allowing researchers to mine the resources and correlate the information, hence empowering all kind of research studies. This trend has been emphasized by several authors in their recent reviews (Atanasov et al., 2015; Harvey et al., 2015) stating that drug discovery from plants requires multidisciplinary approaches. Experiences from the past tell us how important it is, for drug discovery purposes, to access this wide diversity lying in the Plant kingdom, especially because it may be shrinking due to the rapid alterations of the biosphere. In order to fully access the whole chemical diversity without jeopardizing plant biodiversity, alternative ways to collect and store plant tissues can be explored, as for example the use of in vitro culture techniques allowing a renewable and sustainable access to plant chemical diversity. As the final purpose is giving access to workable quantities of therapeutic compound(s), we suggested that the advances in synthetic biology coupled with genomics and bioinformatics can pave the way to possible future strategies of productions of the compounds originating from this diversity. But the chemical diversity in the scaffolds of plant natural compounds is so wide that there is still some space from different strategies for large-scale production: from organic total synthesis for the simpler scaffolds like ephedrine or metformin that are able to be synthetized in few steps, that is to say, at a reasonable cost or, at the other end of the spectrum, heterologous (plant)? production for compounds with more complex scaffolds like taxanes and multistep biosynthesis, and in between even hybrids (multihosts)? semisynthetic strategies can be imagined and developed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 66, "end": 84, "text": "(Hatakeyama, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 145, "end": 164, "text": "(Jian et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 220, "end": 241, "text": "(Nolsoe et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF314"}, {"start": 299, "end": 323, "text": "(Kimura and Saito, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 735, "end": 755, "text": "(Allen et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 951, "end": 974, "text": "(Atanasov et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 975, "end": 995, "text": "Harvey et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}, {"text": "EL and JB wrote the review with the help of PD (modelization) and OR (chemistry).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS"}, {"text": "We would like to thank Ms. Luana Gessica do Carmo da Silva for her help in preparing Figure 2 and Dr. Natalia Sayuri Muto for her help in the language edition of the manuscript.
