We therefore calculate estimates over longer time windows, under the assumption that the instantaneous reproduction number is constant within that time window. At each time step t, we calculate the reproduction number over a time window of size \u03c4 ending at time t. These estimates, denoted Rt,\u03c4, quantify the average transmissibility over a time window of length \u03c4 ending at time t. They are expected to be less variable as the window size \u03c4 increases, because 2 successive time windows will then have increasing overlap. As \u03c4 increases, the estimates of Rt,\u03c4 will also be more precise. In fact, we show in Supplementary Data that the precision of these estimates depends directly on the number of incident cases in the time window [t \u2212 \u03c4 + 1; t]. This allows us to control the precision by adjusting the window size.",

However, times of infection are rarely observed, and the generation time distribution is therefore difficult to measure. On the other hand, the timing of onset of symptoms is usually known, and such data collected in closed settings where transmission can reliably be ascertained (e.g., households) can be used to estimate the distribution of the serial interval (time between onset of symptoms of a case and onset of symptoms of his/her secondary cases).

However, when the serial interval is long (e.g., for measles or smallpox), both effects are more dramatic, and the curves have very different interpretations. For the measles outbreak in Hallegoch, Germany, the highest estimate of Rc is early in the epidemic, on the week ending on day 11, which reflects high transmissibility 2 weeks later (i.e., on the week ending on day 25), coinciding exactly with the peak in the estimated R. This means that the high transmissibility around day 25 is due to cases who have shown symptoms, on average, 2 weeks earlier. Similarly, for the smallpox epidemic in Kosovo, the peak in Rc is on the week ending on day 15, and the peak in R is on the week ending on day 38 (i.e., 23 days later), which is the mean serial interval we have assumed. Transmissibility, measured by the instantaneous reproduction number, was very high during the second generation of cases, around day 38, but this was caused by the first generation of cases, who had symptoms around day 15.",

When the instantaneous reproduction number is estimated on time windows shorter than the average generation time (which is the case for our weekly windows), we expect the case reproduction to be smoother than the instantaneous reproduction number, which could explain why we find higher peaks.

We hope our method will be adopted by epidemiologists and public health organizations. This will be facilitated by the R package and, more importantly, the simple Microsoft Excel tool and the web interface we have developed and released with this paper. These software programs should allow rapid analysis of incidence time series of any infectious disease within the scope described above and should be valuable tools for future outbreak investigations.",
