Campylobacter infection is the most commonly reported bacterial foodborne zoonosis in the European Union since 2005 (EFSA, 2017) and is mainly derived from poultry products. In most cases, clinical symptoms such as fever and diarrhea are self-limiting. However, complications may occur, such as reactive arthritis (Hannu et al., 2002) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (Nachamkin, 2002). Unfortunately, no effective measures to control Campylobacter infection in poultry exist to date (Hermans et al., 2011b). In our previous study (Vandeputte et al., 2019a), vaccination of layer hens resulted in a high and prolonged immune response, observed as the presence of high amounts of anti-Campylobacter IgY in the egg yolk. This hyperimmune yolk was administered to the feed of the broilers at a concentration of 5%, resulting in a decrease of infected birds from 78 to 15%. However, under field conditions, egg yolk as such cannot be implemented and therefore an alternative administration method for these antibodies should be developed.",

Egg yolks were diluted 1/5 (vol/vol) in HBSS, mixed thoroughly, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Lyophilized egg yolks were first diluted 1/2 (wt/vol) in HBSS because half of the egg yolk consists of water (Bizanov, 2017). The supernatant, containing the water-soluble fraction of the egg yolk, was collected for IgY quantification using ELISA. To determine egg yolk IgY titers, 96-well flat bottom plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc Int., Rochester, NY, USA) were coated (24 h, 4\u00b0C) with 106 cfu (before killing) bacterin diluted in a 50 \u03bcL coating buffer (2.16 g Na2CO3.10H2O, 1.935 g NaHCO3 in 500 mL H2O). After washing (3\u00d7 HBSS, 1\u00d7 washing buffer: 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS), the wells were blocked (1 h, room temperature) with a 100 \u03bcL blocking buffer (1% BSA in washing buffer). Next, 100 \u03bcL of a 1/2 dilution series of the supernatant of the mixed egg yolks was incubated during 60 min at room temperature. Plates were washed as described previously and incubated with 100 \u03bcL 1/10,000 horseradish peroxidase\u2013labeled anti-chicken IgY (Sigma Aldrich) in a washing buffer during 90 min at room temperature. After washing as described previously, the plates were incubated with 50 \u03bcL 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Next, 50 \u03bcL 0.5 M H2SO4 was added to each well and the absorbance at 450 nm (OD\n450) was measured using an automated spectrophotometer (Pharmacia LKB Ultrospec III, Gemini BV, Apeldoorn, Netherlands). IgY titers from yolks of immunized hens were reported as the highest dilution where the OD450 was greater than the OD450 + 3 standard deviations of wells containing yolk originating from sham-vaccinated birds.",

The colonization data were analyzed using a hurdle model, a class of models that assumes that the data are generated by 2 processes. First, the event that an individual is colonized (i.e., returning a non-zero count) follows a Bernoulli distribution. Given colonization, its intensity or load is a random variable following a discrete or continuous distribution; in this case, a gamma distribution was assumed. The model was used to estimate the probability of C. jejuni colonization and the mean C. jejuni numbers in the cecal content of colonized birds for each treatment level. Next, the pairwise differences between those and the proportion of the respective posterior distributions that had the same sign as the mean were calculated. If working in a null-hypothesis significance testing framework, this can be interpreted as a one-sided test, estimating the probability that the true difference between treatments is zero or greater (if negative) or smaller (if positive), and thus the level of confidence that the null hypothesis can be rejected. For a detailed description of the implementation in R, reference is made to Vandeputte et al., (2019a).",

This is in contrast to the results of Hermans et al., (2014) and Vandeputte et al., (2019a), the latter applying the same vaccines and procedures as used in this study, but using fresh yolks. A possible explanation is that lyophilization resulted in a 16-fold decline of the Campylobacter-specific antibody titer in the yolk, as determined by ELISA. Previously, Shimizu et al., (1988) found no effect of lyophilization on IgY activity, whereas others showed that freeze-drying resulted in some loss of antigen-binding activity of IgY (Sunwoo et al., 2002). Lyophilization of proteins induces freezing and dehydration stresses, which may result in protein structural changes or even unfolding (Emami et al., 2018). Therefore, to protect the proteins against these stresses, these authors recommend adding cryoprotectants and lyoprotectants.",

To further investigate this hypothesis, further research will be needed, for example, determination of the effect of fresh yolk and lyophilized antibodies on the adherence of C. jejuni to intestinal mucus, because it was demonstrated previously that Campylobacter-specific antibodies enhance mucosal binding (Hermans et al., 2014).
