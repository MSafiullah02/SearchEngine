            "text": "Upon intranasal instillation, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is a prototype neurotropic virus closely related to rabies virus, infects olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal epithelium (Lundh et al., 1987) and moves along the axons to the OB (Reiss et al., 1998). Within the OB, neurons seem to get productively infected, whereas astrocytes are abortively infected (Pfefferkorn et al., 2015). In vivo infection of microglia with VSV has also been shown in very young mice (Chauhan et al., 2010); however, this was not observed in adult mice (Pfefferkorn et al., 2015). Protective IFN-\u03b2 is induced locally within the OB, primarily in astrocytes and to a lesser extent in neurons (Detje et al., 2015, Pfefferkorn et al., 2015), and the virus is efficiently arrested in a type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-dependent manner so that the host is protected from lethal encephalitis (Detje et al., 2009). In addition to the induction of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2), CNS infection via the olfactory route results in recruitment of myeloid cells such as microglia (Getts et al., 2008), and peripheral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) (D\u2019Agostino et al., 2012), T cells, monocytes, and others (Steel et al., 2009) into the CNS.",

Microglia play an essential role in homeostasis as well as in inflammatory processes within the CNS (Nayak et al., 2014, Prinz and Priller, 2014). Although a lot is known about their function during sterile inflammation, the role of microglia is less understood in viral encephalitis. During WNV encephalitis, microglia mediate synaptic loss that drives memory deficits (Vasek et al., 2016). Pharmacological inhibition of CSF-1R that results in microglia depletion revealed their protective role in coronavirus encephalitis (Wheeler et al., 2018). Thus, microglia can have both beneficial as well as detrimental roles during viral encephalitis.",

Thus, this study could not reveal the role of IFNAR signaling of different cell subsets of the CNS in the regulation of myeloid cell responses during viral encephalitis. Few studies revealed the critical role of IFNAR signaling of astrocytes in protection during viral encephalitis (Daniels et al., 2017, Hwang and Bergmann, 2018); however, the role of IFNAR signaling of neurons during viral encephalitis has not been addressed at all so far. Furthermore, intercellular communication in the CNS has not yet been addressed for viral encephalitis.",

We found that VSV infection via the olfactory route induces accumulation of activated microglia and monocytes in the OB via local proliferation and infiltration. Accumulated microglia form an innate immune barrier in peripheral areas of the OB, which plays a key role in restricting VSV spread within the CNS and protects against lethal encephalitis. Formation of the innate microglia barrier is regulated by IFNAR signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia. Our data show mechanisms of regulation of microglia responses during viral encephalitis via intercellular communication.",

To address whether accumulating Iba-1+ cells were exclusively microglia or also infiltrating monocytes, immune cells from brains of VSV-infected tamoxifen-treated CX3CR1-cre-\nER+/\u2212\ntd-tomato\nSt/Wt reporter mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. In these animals also VSV infection led to a significant accumulation of CD45hiCD11bhi cells in the brain (Figures 2C and 2D). It is proposed that during CNS inflammation microglia can upregulate CD45 expression and become indistinguishable from infiltrating monocytes (Greter et al., 2015, Yamasaki et al., 2014). In order to verify this, expression of the td-tomato reporter was analyzed in the CD45hiCD11bhi population. Indeed, among CD45hiCD11bhi cells increased numbers of td-tomato+ cells were detected on 6 dpi compared with controls (Figures 2E and 2G). Since in these mice CNS-associated perivascular macrophages (PVMs) also remain td-tomato+ after 8 weeks of tamoxifen injection (Goldmann et al., 2016), we stained for Tmem119, a microglia-specific marker (Bennett et al., 2016), and CD206, a PVM marker (Mrdjen et al., 2018), to exclude PVMs from the analysis. In control animals, most of the cells in the CD45lowCD11blow population expressed Tmem119, whereas basically no cells in the CD45hiCD11bhi population expressed Tmem119 (Figure 2F; Figure S2B). However, upon VSV infection, there was a significant increase in the Tmem119+CD206\u2212 cells within the CD45hiCD11bhi population (Figures 2F and 2G), confirming the presence of microglia in the CD45hiCD11bhi population from infected animals. A significant increase in td-tomato\u2212Ly6C+ events also confirmed infiltration of peripheral monocytes in the CNS (Figures 2E and 2G; Figures S2C and S2D). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling experiments in these mice revealed that CD45lowCD11blow cells did not show significant BrdU incorporation, whereas CD45hiCD11bhi cells showed significantly increased percentages of BrdU-positive cells in infected animals (Figures 2H and 2I). Together, these data show that upon i.n. VSV infection proliferating microglia and infiltrating monocytes accounted for the accumulation of myeloid cells within the CNS.",

In control animals, myeloid cells consisted mostly of CD45lowCD11blow microglia, with very few CD45hiCD11bhi cells that did not express td-tomato, suggesting that these cells were not PVMs. However, upon infection, we observed the emergence of CD45hiCD11bhitd-tomato+ cells, suggesting that upon infection a part of the CD45low microglia present in the OB upregulated CD45 and became CD45hi (Figure 3\nA). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed significant changes in the regulation of genes between myeloid cells from VSV-infected compared with control animals. Regulated genes were involved in IFN responses, immune responses and its regulation, responses to inflammation, antigen processing and presentation, and regulation of plasma membrane and cell surface-associated functions (Figure 3B). Principal-component analysis showed that infection induced a major change in the gene expression profiles of microglia and that microglia and monocytes present in the OB had distinct gene signatures (Figure 3C). Interestingly, even though CD45hiCD11bhi microglia in infected animals were derived mostly from CD45lowCD11blow microglia, both populations had distinct gene expression profiles with only few genes commonly regulated between them (Figure 3D).",

Infiltrating monocytes showed enhanced numbers of Ccr2 transcripts compared to microglia. Additionally, these cells also showed higher expression of Nos2 and Cd86 transcripts (Figure 3E; Figure S3). Interestingly, microglia and monocytes from infected animals showed expression of the Mki67 gene, which is associated with proliferation (Figure 3E). Together, these fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and RNA-seq studies confirm the presence of CD45hi microglia in the OB upon VSV infection and show that they are distinct from CD45low microglia in terms of their gene expression during CNS infection.",

We used this method to deplete microglia and addressed whether the accumulation of microglia was essential to arrest VSV spread via the olfactory route. BLZ945 treatment reduced the numbers of microglia in control animals as well as in VSV-infected animals as seen by immunohistology (Figures 4A and 4B). Depletion of microglia was also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of CNS immune cells from control animals, which showed a significant decrease in the number of CD45lowCD11blow cells in BLZ945 treated animals compared to controls (Figures 4D and 4E). Flow cytometry analysis of CNS immune cells from VSV-infected animals showed a significant decrease in the number of CD45lowCD11blow cells, but not in CD45hiCD11bhi cells (Figures 4D and 4E). These data show that decreased accumulation of Iba-1+ cells observed in immunohistology (Figures 4A and 4B) was due to depletion of microglia, and not due to the lack of infiltration of blood monocytes. Along with the major decrease in the number of microglia, we also observed a minute, but statistically significant, decrease in CD45hiCD11bhi cells, suggesting depletion of some perivascular and meningeal macrophages (Figures 4D and 4E). Staining of CD11b and CSF-1R in blood cells (Figure 4C) and the presence of CD45hiCD11bhi cells in the CNS upon VSV infection (Figures 4D and 4E) showed that BLZ945 did not deplete blood monocytes or inhibit their accumulation in the CNS. CD86, CD206, and Ly6C expression of myeloid cells was comparable between vehicle- or BLZ945-treated animals, suggesting that BLZ945 treatment did not inhibit activation of myeloid cells (Figures S4A and S4B).",

Analysis of Iba-1+ cells in the OB of such uninfected mice showed a normal distribution of Iba-1+ cells with long thin processes similar to WT control animals (Figure 5\nA; see Figure 1). Upon VSV infection, CX3CR1-cre-\nER+/\u2212\nIFNAR\nfl/fl mice showed increased numbers of Iba-1+ cells comparable with WT animals on 6 dpi. In contrast, in infected Nes-cre\n+/\u2212\nIFNAR\nfl/fl mice, accumulation of Iba-1+ cells was impaired at 4 and 6 dpi (Fig, 5A-C).

The astrocyte-specific cre expression in these mice was confirmed by the analysis of GFAP-cre\n+/\u2212\nRosa26eYFP\nSt/Wt reporter offspring, which showed YFP expression in astrocytes, but not in neurons (Figure S5).

Similarly, Syn1-cre\n+/\u2212\nIFNAR\nfl/fl animals lacking IFNAR signaling on neurons also showed many Iba-1+ cells that stained positive for Mac-3 (Figure 5A), but accumulation of Iba-1+ cells was also impaired upon VSV infection (Figures 5A and 5C).",

VSV instillation activated myeloid cells, especially microglia, accumulated in the glomerular layer of the OB. Depletion of microglia during infection led to enhanced virus spread in the CNS and caused lethal encephalitis. This suggests that upon CNS virus infection microglia form an innate barrier in the OB that controls virus spread via the olfactory route. IFNAR signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia, regulated the activation of myeloid cells, and IFNAR signaling of neurons had a stronger impact on activation than IFNAR signaling of astrocytes. This was also reflected by the number of accumulated myeloid cells in the OB, local proliferation of activated myeloid cells, and protection against virus spread into the CNS and subsequent lethal disease. Thus, our results highlight the relevance of cross talk among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia for the regulation of microglia activation and its protective role during CNS virus infection.",

On 6 dpi, there was significant accumulation of activated proliferating microglia and infiltrating monocytes in the glomerular region of the OB as detected by immunohistology and verified by flow cytometry of genetically microglia marked mice. Light sheet microscopy of whole intact OB of microglia marked mice showed that, upon i.n. VSV infection, microglia accumulated in the glomerular region of the whole OB. These 3D data were supported by immunohistology data that also showed accumulation of Iba-1+ cells in the glomerular region of the OB. It was previously shown that VSV is arrested in the glomerular region of the OB (Detje et al., 2009). A similar observation was made in the VSV infection model for brain DC, in which CD11c-YFP mice were used to study the dynamics of DC in the OB after VSV infection. In that study, also accumulation of Iba-1+CD11c+ cells was detected, which the authors defined as DC (D\u2019Agostino et al., 2012). However, it is possible that a part of these CD11c+ cells in fact were microglia, as recently it has been shown that microglia also express CD11c during neuroinflammation (Greter et al., 2015). In our study also the accumulation of Iba-1+ cells was detected at 4 dpi and continued at 6 dpi. Together, these data suggest that the OB is the site of immune response during pathogen entry via the olfactory route.",

Using genetically microglia marked mice, we found that upon CNS virus infection some microglia shifted to the CD45hi population, which we also confirmed by Tmem119 expression analysis and flow cytometry. Since microglia have been implemented to play a detrimental role in the long-term complications of encephalitis (Vasek et al., 2016), observation of two distinct microglia populations (CD45low and CD45hi) and infiltrating monocytes motivated us to characterize these cells in greater detail. Analysis of gene expression via RNA-seq of sorted myeloid cells from the OB showed that both microglia and monocytes had distinct gene expression profiles. Infection and associated responses led to extensive changes in microglia gene expression. Although both microglia and monocytes showed IFNAR stimulation as indicated by abundant induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are expressed upon IFNAR stimulation and have many antiviral functions, and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, there were still significant differences in gene expression profiles of the different subpopulations. Microglia from uninfected animals showed high expression of many microglia-specific genes. While microglia-specific function of Tmem119 is not known yet, Sall1 has been identified as a negative regulator of microglia activation (Buttgereit et al., 2016). Interestingly, Sall1 was downregulated in microglia from infected animals. Thus, presumably Sall1 expression is regulated by neuro-glial cross talk during CNS infection.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that accumulation of microglia in the glomerular region of the OB was an innate immune defense mechanism that restricted virus spread via the olfactory route. In order to experimentally address this, we depleted microglia using a pharmacological method (Pyonteck et al., 2013) in animals i.n. instilled with VSV. This allowed depletion of microglia with high efficiency, although there was also a very minor depletion of PVMs. However, the number of blood monocytes and the accumulation of CD45hiCD11bhi cells in the CNS upon VSV infection did not differ between vehicle- and BLZ945-treated animals. For microglial maintenance, IL-34 is required and it acts as the ligand for CSF-1R, whereas CSF-1 is the ligand for monocyte development (Greter et al., 2012). Thus, specific microglia depletion could be achieved by BLZ945 inhibiting the interaction of CSF-1R with IL-34, but not with CSF-1. Increased spread and presence of virus in the brain after microglia depletion suggest that accumulated microglia in the OB provide an innate immune shield against virus entry via the olfactory route. Theoretically, it could also be possible that the enhanced virus spread in the CNS was due to the small decrease in the number of PVMs, and not due to the large decrease in the number microglia in the CNS parenchyma. However, since on 7 dpi there is no difference in the viral titers in the OB of vehicle- or BLZ945-treated animals, it is very likely that after i.n. infection not the viral entry into the CNS, but the spread of the virus in the CNS was enhanced. Similar observations were also made in other studies where depletion of microglia led to enhanced virus and lethality after coronavirus and flavivirus infections (Seitz et al., 2018, Wheeler et al., 2018). Notably, in the study by Wheeler et al., there was depletion of PVMs. However, in our as well as their study, the decrease in the numbers of PVM is very minor compared with the decrease in the number of microglia. Since the spread of the virus within the CNS is enhanced and not the entry in the CNS, it can be concluded that microglia are responsible for inhibition of virus spread within the CNS. Peripheral organs of these animals did not show detectable virus, indicating that inhibition of CSF-1R did not induce general immune suppression. Thus, our data show a direct antiviral role of microglia after viral entry via the i.n. route.",

However, the role of different CNS cell types in regulating myeloid cell activation during viral encephalitis has not been addressed in depth. Therefore, we focused on investigating this aspect in our model of VSV encephalitis after i.n. infection. Lack of Iba-1+ cell proliferation, accumulation, and activation-associated cellular morphology in animals lacking IFNAR signaling of neurons or astrocytes, but not microglia, suggest a model in which the IFN-\u03b2 produced within the OB acts on neurons and astrocytes and type I IFN stimulation-induced changes in neurons and astrocytes regulate microglia functions and phenotype. This is in contrast to the study by Nayak et al., in which it was proposed that IFNAR signaling of myeloid cells was essential for their full activation and dynamics of accumulation. One of the possible reasons for the lack of microglial activation and accumulation in mice with a selective IFNAR deletion on astrocytes or neurons could be high viral titers in the CNS. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that, in all of the animals, virus is present in the OB and therefore microglia from WT animals are also exposed to high amounts of virus at least early after infection. Thus, the lack of microglia activation seen in the animals lacking IFNAR signaling of neurons and astrocytes is due to abrogated neuron-astrocyte-microglia communication.",
