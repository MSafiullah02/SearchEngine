Based on the genomic organization and genetic analysis (Green et al., 2000), the family Caliciviridae is divided into at least four genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus (NoV), and Sapovirus (SaV) with a new proposed genus, NB-like (Oliver et al., 2006, Smiley et al., 2002). The NoV genome is organized into three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the nonstructural proteins (ORF1), the major capsid protein (ORF2) and the minor capsid protein (ORF3) (Jiang et al., 1993, Lambden et al., 1993). Based on the genetic divergence in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid genes, the NoVs have been tentatively assigned to five genogroups (G) with multiple genotypes (Zheng et al., 2006). The strains of three genogroups, GI, GII, and GIV, are found in humans (GII-11 and GII-19 are porcine), and GIII and GV strains are found in cows and mice (Zheng et al., 2006).",

In recent years, genomic data has been obtained from the two viruses, Bo/Jena/80/DE and Bo/Newbury2/76/UK, and these strains were assigned into the prototype bovine NoVs (BNoVs) of genotype 1 (GIII-1) and genotype-2 (GIII-2) within GIII, respectively. Further isolates of the genotype 1 or genotype 2 BNoVs have been identified in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and United States (Liu et al., 1999, Oliver et al., 2003, Oliver et al., 2004, Smiley et al., 2003, van der Poel et al., 2003, Wise et al., 2004), which have confirmed the existence of the two distinct genotypes.",

The ages of the calves tested ranged from 2 to 90 days. The fecal samples were examined for common bacterial enteric pathogens including Salmonella spp., Clostridium spp., Campylobacter spp. using specific agar media, and any suspect colonies were identified using biochemical tests. The shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli was detected using a PCR assay, as described elsewhere (Asakura et al., 1998). For the viral assays, fecal suspensions of each sample were prepared immediately by diluting the feces 1:10 in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The suspensions were then vortexed for 30 s, centrifuged (1200 \u00d7 \ng for 20 min), and the supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further testing.",

The alignment indicated that the Korean Bo/MA88/KOR strain clustered with the GIII-1 prototype, the Bo/Jena/DE strain, whereas the remaining 11 Korean BNoVs clustered with the GIII-2 prototype, the Bo/Newbury2/UK strain (Fig. 1\n).

In addition, the GIII-1 BNoV strains, one Korean strain Bo/MA88/KOR and one German strain (Bo/Jena/DE; Liu et al., 1999), showed a low aa identity with the human sapovirus (SaV) (24.1%), BEC-NBV (18.5%), rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (21.3%), and feline calicivirus (FCV) (27.8%) strains, whereas there was slightly higher aa identity with the human GI, GII and GIV NoV (56.5\u201372.2%), porcine GII-2 NoV (59.3\u201360.2%), and murine GV NoV (50.0\u201350.9%) strains.

This aa identity is similar to findings reported by Oliver et al. (2003) and Wise et al.

Like the other RNA viruses, the NoVs show broad genomic sequence diversity between the circulating strains, which is partly due to the poor template fidelity of their RNA polymerases (Zheng et al., 2006). Therefore, it is expected that more genetic clusters will be identigied within GIII in the future when more sequence data of the BNoVs circulating in cattle becomes available.",

Therefore, other bovine enteric pathogens might play a role in the clinical and pathological presentation of this disease because many other enteric viruses have been found to be associated with diarrhea in cattle and cause lesions of villous atrophy (BRVs, BCoVs, BToVs, BEC-NBV, etc.). In this study, 5.9% of the diarrheic fecal samples testing positive to the BNoVs also tested positive to other pathogens including the BEC-NBV, BRVs A, B and C, BCoV, BToV, BVDV and shiga-toxin-producing E. coli. This suggests that a number of enteric pathogens, either singly or in combination, can influence the clinical course of BNoV infections (Almeida et al., 1978, Reynolds et al., 1986, Woode and Bridger, 1978).",
