This phenomenon can be explained by a stark difference in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we review basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and mortality. As a case study, we then investigate how total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between China and Italy evolve over two months until May 7th 2020.",

The data used are outdated at the time of writing and may, in fact, not even be comparable in the first place due to a number of issues such as, e.g., discrepancies in reporting and testing practices across countries. Nevertheless, the below may still illustrate some fundamental and useful concepts in causal inference to facilitate reasoning about different causal hypothesis regarding the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, relating to the attribution of mortality to different factors.",

The key to understanding the phenomenon lies in the fact that we are dealing with relative frequencies: the CFRs shown in percent in Figure 1a are ratios and correspond to the conditional probabilities of fatality given a case from a particular age group and country. However, such percentages conceal the absolute numbers of cases within each age group. Considering these absolute numbers (shown in small print below the CFRs in Table 1 ), sheds light on how the phenomenon can arise: the distribution of cases across age groups differs significantly between the two countries, i.e., there is a statistical association between the country of reporting and the number of confirmed cases per age group. In particular, Italy recorded a much higher proportion of confirmed cases in older patients compared to China. This is illustrated in Figure 1b (see Table 2 for exact numbers).",

As can be seen (and noted already in \u00a74.2), the NDE is negative initially meaning that the considered change of country would lead to a further decrease in CFR consistent with the lower CFRs in each age group noted in \u00a72. However, there is a turning point between 12 and 19 of March when the NDE flips sign and becomes positive: beyond this point, switching to the Italian CFRs would thus lead to an increase in total CFR on the Chinese case demographic. While we can only speculate about the precise factors that came together in producing this reversal in NDE, it seems worth pointing out that a number of articles reported an over-whelmed health care system \"close to collapse\" in (northern) Italy during the same period of early to mid-March (e.g., Armocida et al., 2020) .

Moreover, different testing policies have clearly been adopted in different countries, C \u2192 T , and even across different regions within the same country.

However, causal sufficiency is not strictly necessary for identifying NDE and NIE, and, subject to the availability of experimental data, it can potentially be replaced by a weaker set of assumptions.
