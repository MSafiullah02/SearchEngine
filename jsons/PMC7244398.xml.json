Virtual conferences can offer more than an alternative to conventional face-to-face events. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing healthcare associations, and otherwise, to re-evaluate the need for international travel and \u2018cross-border contamination\u2019, the role for virtual conferencing is expanding. Prior to COVID-19, there have been concerns regarding the negative consequences arising from greenhouse gas emissions resulting from traveling to conferences and meetings [2\u20138]. Technological capabilities are no longer a hindrance and people are now well acquainted with online environments. Saving time, money and resources are other benefits that come with online conferencing. In fact, these economic benefits can be shared by many of the different stakeholders involved. In addition, due to their inclusive character, virtual meetings can attract international participants for local events. Virtual meetings allow universities and healthcare associations to increase their outreach and international collaborations and position their research on an international stage.",

Additional articles reviewed are referenced here [12\u201326]. For lay articles, Google was searched on April 11, 2020. Boolean operators were used, and three separate searches were carried out which are listed below. Results were reviewed for the first 5 pages of each search strategy, with search settings displaying 10 results per page with the location set as Canada. Advertisements and reviews of conferencing technologies were excluded from the results of the search. No click-throughs were undertaken; thus, only the first web page encountered was indexed.
