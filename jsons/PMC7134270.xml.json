Studies indicate that an annotation tool is invaluable in developing shared perspectives of standards in digital moderation [11, 12]. The limited accessibility of such tools increases cognitive demands on the educator and the process can become less reliable [11].

The privacy and confidentiality of each school\u2019s work must be guaranteed while all access to a student\u2019s private space should be denied.Usability: the tool should be user friendly and self-explanatory.Portability: possible to set up the system on another server without difficulty.Infrastructure: hosting institutions should have adequate infrastructure.Bandwidth: increased bandwidth will increase the efficiency of the system.\n",

            "text": "\nChallenges of current moderation practices: The greatest challenge is that it is time consuming to scan portfolios before uploading these documents digitally. Huge amounts of paper is wasted when moderating manually. A related challenge of paper-based moderation is that of \u201cinconsistent record-keeping\u201d and the fear of losing evidence of moderation. Together with the costs of paper, printing and other consumables, costs are incurred when portfolios are couriered to \u201cout of town\u201d schools.Benefits of current moderation practices: Participants\u2019 responses were mostly positive for those who use some form of digital moderation. The most frequent response was that Google Drive or Google docs are used for moderation processes. Respondents agreed that it is easy and effortless to use Google Drive. Feedback is timely and eModeration is especially convenient when the school is in a rural area. A related benefit is that eModeration reduces the costs of transporting or posting portfolios.Challenges of eModeration: The most common challenge was Internet connectivity. Additional challenges: differing file formats, access to necessary resources like scanners, a knowledge of the system, versioning problems, the time required to learn to use the system and the time consumed in scanning the necessary documents. A respondent mentioned \u201cAnnotation of content.\u201d However, it is not evident if the reference was to the availability of the tools or the knowledge required to use these tools. A significant finding is that although some respondents indicated using a digital moderation process as evidenced by the following: \u201cI have been using an eModeration system for the past 3 years and will never go back to a paper-based system again\u201d, other respondents responded as: \u201cI have only used Google Docs and am Will (sic) be honest to say I do not know what an eModeration system is.\u201dPerceived benefits of an eModeration system: ease of use, faster feedback, cheaper than couriering portfolios, faster to find digital files, easy to upload files.Requirements for an eModeration system: Respondents mentioned Internet bandwidth, multiple access and reliability but did not expand on these aspects. The requirements for an eModeration system are summarized using the specific quotations of respondents:\nConnection availability: \u201cA good internet connection and a secure drop site.\u201dConnection speed: \u201cFast connection speed.\u201dAdditional resources: \u201cEquipment. Good quality scanner which can handle bulk scanning.\u201dAttitude: \u201cA positive attitude towards the use of this technology.\u201dAvailability of system: \u201cBeing always available.\u201dAnnotation: \u201cAnnotation that will allow for different moderation styles.\u201dCommunication: \u201cIt should make communication easier.\u201dEase of use: \u201cAn easy to use interface with standardized organization for files and folders.\u201dFlexibility: \u201cFlexibility so one can moderate one section only or start at the back.\u201dResponsiveness: \u201cThe system needs to be responsive and not have huge amounts of latency.\u201dSecurity: \u201cThere should be sufficient security to ensure that the portfolios can only be seen by the school and relevant moderator.\u201dTimely feedback: \u201cIt should save me time. It should also give you feedback as to whether the other person is actively involved in the moderation process.\u201d\n",

After the analysis, core technological characteristics that were initially left out of the survey were added to the requirements. Context specific items, for instance a voice over button arising from the focus group interview, were added. The identified dimensions were then analyzed further. Dimensions present in 2 or more streams of evidence (literature review, survey and focus group) were included. These values were categorized under UR, SR or TR; with some overlap. For instance, file formats was categorized as both SR and TR. User characteristics inform UR. It was thus deemed necessary to include a separate dimension for user characteristics.",

A single exploratory case study strategy was employed to determine the challenges, benefits and requirements of an eModeration system with the purpose of identifying requirements for an eModeration system. Empirical data was collected from a focus group interview and an online survey to investigate the current moderation practices of IT and CAT teachers at private secondary schools in SA and triangulate the findings with the challenges, benefits and requirements abstracted from literature. The requirements for an eModeration system (presented under the categories of UR, TR and SR) constitute the theoretical contribution of the study. The pre-adoption attributes could be useful to designers and developers of eModeration systems and hence constitute a practical contribution.",
