Key virulence factors in\nS. aureus\ninclude the leukocytolytic toxin Panton\u2013Valentine leukocidin, which has been associated with necrotizing lung infections.\n8\nIn addition, small colony variants\n9\n10\nand biofilm formation\n11\n12\nmay contribute to increased antimicrobial resistance and accelerate lung disease.

It has been associated with several negative clinical outcomes, including accelerated decline in lung function, increased hospitalization, and earlier mortality in patients with CF. Ren et al noted significantly lower lung function in MRSA-infected individuals with CF compared with those with predominant MSSA-positive respiratory tract cultures.\n23\nIndividuals with CF who are MRSA positive have a higher rate of hospitalization and increased use of oral, inhaled, and intravenous antibiotics, compared with MRSA-negative patients.\n23\nFurthermore, Dasenbrook et al reported that the rate of lung function decline was greater in patients with MRSA compared with MRSA-negative patients in patients aged 8 to 21 years (MRSA-positive patients had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV\n1\n] decline of 2.06% predicted/year compared with 1.44% predicted/year in those without MRSA; difference\u20140.62% predicted/year, 95% confidence interval [CI]: \u2212 0.70 to \u2212 0.54;\np\n = 0.001).\n24\n",
