This is necessary because many data are only available in age ranges or for both sexes and all COD data must be sex-age specific. This occurs after using all data to produce a global age/sex pattern which is then used to proportionally split those data. The next step is garbage code redistribution. This takes deaths that are coded to causes of death that are not part of the GBD hierarchy and assigns them to an appropriate cause of death. A relevant example would be deaths coded to sepsis. This is a nonspecific cause of death. A series of regressions determines the proportion of these garbage codes that should be reassigned to each cause. The last step is noise reduction which is essentially a way to move data points up or down in magnitude based on regional trends. The amount of change is dependent on the data variance. Those points with greater variance are subject to be moved more than those with lesser variance. Data points from verbal autopsy studies and data points that are not nationally representative have variance that is inflated to account for these issues. ",

CODEm produces a large suite of models based on either cause fraction or mortality rate, uses mixed-effects linear and space-time Gaussian process regression models, and a covariate selection process. Each sub-model is evaluated using out-of-sample predictive validity. Thirty percent of the data are excluded from the initial model fits and 15% are used to evaluate component models and 15% used to build the ensembles. The sub-models are ranked using 15% of the data based on their out-of-sample predictive validity. The proportion weighting of the ensemble sub-models is evaluated using the remaining 15% of the hold-out data. This weighting scheme evaluates ensemble models that are built with ranked sub-models contributing proportionally more or fewer draws to the final ensemble. The final ensemble model is evaluated against other ensemble models using the same fit statistics (in-sample, out-of-sample root mean squared error and data coverage). Detailed information on this process can be found in Foreman et al 2012 1 and in the GBD 2017 Mortality and Causes of Death manuscript. 2 LRI mortality is estimated for 23 age groups, 774 locations, both sexes, and every year from . We estimated LRI mortality separately for males and females and for children under 5 years and older than 5 years due to expected underlying differences in the risk of mortality between these age groups. Data-rich and data-poor geographic locations were modelled separately and these models were then hybridised for a global model. This was to maintain proper uncertainty in the models where trusted data on causes of death exist. For a detailed description of the input data coverage, completeness, and reliability of the cause of death data in GBD 2017, please refer to the scoring system introduced in the GBD 2016 Mortality Collaborators manuscript. 3",

Details on CODEm covariate and sub-model selection can be found elsewhere 4 but the core idea is that submodels are built first using level 1 covariates and by adding covariates until the coefficient is either not significant or changes direction. The \"direction\" of a covariate is the sign of the coefficient. For covariates where the direction is positive, the covariate should be associated with LRI mortality such that greater exposure to the covariate is related to greater LRI mortality. The inverse is true for covariates where the direction is negative. estimates produced by the MCEE are informed by the incidence of pneumonia in 35 cohort studies which informed an envelope of pneumonia incidence that was related to the prevalence of five risk factors for pneumonia to estimate country-level incidence. 5, 6 While there is overlap in the risk factors used in both studies, GBD 2016 utilised over 30,000 data points from more than 700 sources to produce internally consistent estimates of LRI incidence, prevalence, and mortality.",

We accepted four survey definitions for the prevalence of symptoms of LRI: 1) Cough with difficulty breathing with the symptoms in the chest with a fever was our gold standard but we also accepted 2) Cough with difficulty breathing with the symptoms in the chest without fever, 3) Cough with difficulty breathing with fever, and 4) Cough with difficulty breathing without fever. To make these definitions comparable, we identified the surveys that met the best case definition (definition 1). Within these surveys, we calculated the ratio of the prevalence of the best case definition to the prevalence of the alternate definitions. This ratio was regressed using age in years (factor), year of the survey, and GBD region (random intercept).

Third, any data that was presented as both sexes combined or for 0-59 months combined, we used the age and sex pattern from all data sources that included that detail to split into corresponding and age-and sex-specific data.

A weighting algorithm combined each distribution to find the optimal combination of these distributions for each survey, minimising the absolute prediction error across the entire distribution. Ensemble weights for each survey were then averaged across all surveys to produce a single set of global weights of the ensemble distributions. Weights were different for each sex, but invariant across geography, time, and age group.

GBD 2016 estimates, owing to smaller sample sizes in younger age groups, do have wider uncertainty in those age groups. Third, GBD 2015, like all analyses of growth failure before it, assumed that high-income countries had zero prevalence of child growth failure.

Fourth, GBD 2015 did not use an ensemble approach or estimate the entire distribution of Z scores.

Individual country level estimates were therefore based on a combination of information from the country, its region and super-region. This was implemented within a Bayesian Hierarchical modelling (BHM) framework. BHMs provide an extremely useful and flexible framework in which to model complex relationships and dependencies in data. Uncertainty can also be propagated through the model allowing uncertainty arising from different components, both data sources and models, to be incorporated within estimates of uncertainty associated with the final estimates. The results of the modelling comprise a posterior distribution for each grid cell, rather than just a single point estimate, allowing a variety of summaries to be calculated. The primary outputs here are the median and 95% credible intervals for each grid cell. Based on the availability of ground measurement data, modelling and evaluation was focused on the year 2016.",

The model used for GBD2017, henceforth referred to as DIMAQ2, provides a number of substantial improvements over the initial formulation of DIMAQ. In DIMAQ, ground measurements from different years were all assumed to have been made in the primary year of interest (i.e. 2014 for GBD2015 before extrapolation) and then regressed against values from other inputs (e.g. satellites etc.) made in that year. In the presence of changes over time therefore, and particularly in areas where no recent measurements were available, there was the possibility of mismatches between the ground measurements and other variables. In DIMAQ2, ground measurements and matched with other inputs (over time) and the possibility of the (global level) coefficients being allowed to vary over time, subject to smoothing that is induced by a second-order random walk process. In addition, the manner in which spatial variation can be incorporated within the model has developed: where there is sufficient data, the calibration equations can now vary (smoothly) both within and between countries, achieved by allowing the coefficients to follow (smooth) Gaussian processes. Where there is insufficient data within a country, to produce accurate equations, as before information is borrowed from lower down the hierarchy and it is supplemented with information from the wider region.",

Reductions can be seen in all super-regions with particular improvement in the Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania super-region which is based largely on a substantial increase in accuracy in China, PwRMSE 6 vs 9 \u00b5g/m 3 ",

The TMREL was defined as a uniform distribution rather than a fixed value in order to represent the uncertainty regarding the level at which the scientific evidence was consistent with adverse effects of exposure. The specific outdoor air pollution cohort studies selected for this averaging were based on the criteria that their 5 th percentiles were less than that of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention II (CPSII) cohort's 5 th percentile of 8.2 based on Turner et al.

Since we did not find that household composition varied between smokers and non-smokers, we then used the GBD 2017 primary smoking prevalence model to calculate the probability that each household member is a smoker. Next, we used the probability of the union of sets on each individual household member to calculate the overall probability that at least one of the other household members was a smoker. We incorporated occupational exposure by modelling prevalence of current exposure to secondhand smoke at work, by age, sex, location, and year, using ST-GPR. In order to avoid double counting we calculated the probability that an individual is exposed through either non-occupational exposure or occupational exposure, given their age, sex, and household composition.

We implemented a vaccine-specific bias adjustment process to account for bias in administrative reports of immunization coverage in the JRF for DTP3 vaccine coverage.

We model this bias in a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) framework, described further in the subsequent section of this appendix, using the Socio-demographic index (SDI) as a predictor. This method allows us to estimate antigen-specific administrative bias factors for all geographies and years since 1980, even in places without survey data, by borrowing strength in data across space and time. The GPR framework properly estimates prediction errors in the data synthesis procedure by for uncertainty in bias ratios when generating fitted values.

The term \"low birth weight\" has historically been used to refer to birth weight (BW) less than 2500 grams. However, because the goal of the GBD risk factors analysis is to quantify the entirety of attributable burden due to each risk factor, the GBD definition of \"low birth weight\" therefore refers to all birth weight below the Theoretical Minimum Risk Exposure Level (TMREL) for birth weight. Likewise, newborns have been typically been classified into gestational age (GA) categories of \"extremely preterm\" (<28 weeks of gestation), \"very preterm\" (28-<32 weeks of gestation), and \"moderate to late preterm\" (32-<37 weeks of gestation). \"Short gestation\" in GBD refers to all gestational ages below the gestational age TMREL.",

For discontinued breastfeeding, we assumed that children aged 6 to 23 months who received any breastmilk as a source of nourishment to be at the lowest risk of disease outcome.",

Population data A comprehensive set of population data on a high-resolution grid was obtained from the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) database.

Aggregation to each 0.1 o \u00d70.1 o grid cell comprised of summing the central 3 \u00d7 3 population cells.
