Infections with these viruses are frequently detected in both feral and domestic hogs in many geographic regions.20,21 These data are also consistent with human data for the gamma herpesvirus EBV where 90% of the human population worldwide carries this virus as a persistent infection, and the virus remains latent in B cells and is easily detectable by PCR even in healthy individuals.28 It was interesting that the sows that tested positive for PLHV2 and PLHV3 did not appear to transmit the virus to piglets derived by caesarian section. While the numbers are small, no transmission was detected from three sows infected with PLHV2 to 18 piglets derived by caesarian section. Similarly, a single sow failed to transmit PLHV3 to 7 piglets also derived by caesarian section. These data appear to suggest that procedures used to derive the piglets efficiently prevented transmission of these viruses, but it is possible that infection might have become apparent if the piglets were tested later in life.It was somewhat surprising that the betaherpesvirus, PCMV, was not detected in any of the sows tested here, although this assay has detected this virus in subsequent specimens from adult pigs. PCMV is a common infection of pigs in many parts of the world and has been expertly reviewed recently.29 This virus is most closely related to the human roseolaviruses, and the great majorityof pigs in herds are seropositive for this virus. 30 However, infection rates in the US (12%) are reported to be much lower than those in other countries and is one possible reason why no DNA was detected. 31 Experimental primary infections with PCMV resulted in congenital infection of many of the piglets and confirmed the transplacental potential for infection with this virus. 32 This is distinct from human roseolavirus infections, with HHV-6 being transmitted congenitally in about 1% of live births without any apparent symptoms in the infants, although the integration of HHV-6 into the host genome makes the detection of congenital infections problematic. 33It is important to remain mindful of the potential transmission of porcine herpesviruses, such as alphaherpesvirus suid herpesvirus 1, to humans. Anecdotal reports in the literature seem to suggest that the transmission is indeed possible, yet significant barriers to human infection likely exist.34 Potential transmission of the betaherpesvirus PCMV to human cells has also been investigated, but limitations in available reagents have thus far prevented the unequivocal documentation of transmission.35,36 The porcine gammaherpesviruses also might have some potential to be transmitted to humans, and coinfection of cells with EBV might be a factor as the mutual transactivation of these viruses has been reported.34 Isolation of sows during pregnancy combined with cesarean delivery and a rigorous testing regimen for the presence of virus nucleic acids in transgenic piglets should minimize the potential for transmission of this and other viruses to the piglets.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "Viruses detected by assays described here include porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and the closely related virus porcine respiratory coronavirus, 23 as well as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). None of the 9 sows described here tested positive for any coronavirus and was unsurprising as specimens were collected during the summer months when infections would be expected to be less frequent. Subsequent testing with these assays detected the betacoronavirus PHEV in specimens collected during the winter months and is consistent with reports showing that it is frequently detected in domestic animals in the US. 25 This virus is a common infection in swine in many countries including the United States and is related to the circulating human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. 38 Thus far, no alphacoronavirus infections have been detected including PEDV, TGEV, and porcine respiratory coronavirus.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Additional supporting information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of the article.
