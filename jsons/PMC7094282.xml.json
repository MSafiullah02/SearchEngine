For expression in X laevis oocytes, the plasmids were linearized and used as template for RNA synthesis (mMESSAGEmMACHINE; Ambion, Austin, TX). The mutation in human B0AT1 and ACE2 was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

Expressed alone in oocytes, human B0AT1 induced a low amino acid transport rate as shown by us and others previously.1, 2 We show here that its coexpression with mouse or human ACE2 or human collectrin increases the transport function \u223c10-fold (Supplementary Figure 1\nA; see supplemental material online at www.gastrojournal.org). The mouse orthologue of collectrin did not activate human B0AT1, although it has been shown to be effective on mouse B0AT1.3 We have as yet no explanation for this differential impact of the collectrin orthologues in the X laevis expression system. Different from collectrin, ACE2 has one catalytic site. It is a carboxypeptidase and converts angiotensin I and II to angiotensin 1\u20139 and 1\u20137, respectively,20, 21 functionally antagonizing its homologue ACE. We analyzed the role of the catalytic activity of ACE2 in the functional interaction with B0AT1 (Supplementary Figure 1\nB; see supplemental material online at www.gastrojournal.org). The catalytically dead mutant (ACE2 R273Q)14 was as efficient as the wild type in enhancing B0AT1 function, suggesting that it is not necessary for the interaction. This was expected because human collectrin shares 48% identity with ACE2 at the level of its carboxyl-terminal membrane anchor region but entirely lacks the extracellular peptidase domain.22\n",

In the case of R240Q, its surface expression is not increased upon coexpression with ACE2 or collectrin, but coimmunoprecipitation demonstrates that its interaction with ACE2 is not abolished. Assuming a qualitative effect of the R240Q mutation on this interaction, our observation is nonetheless potentially compatible with the hypothesis recently put forward by the group of Broer, namely that the localization of this mutation at the surface of B0AT1 might impact on the interaction with accessory proteins.23 Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism by which this mutation, initially classified as an SNP, prevents the normal activation of B0AT1 by the accessory proteins. In contrast, in the case of the other functional mutant of this class A69T, an increase in cell surface expression of this mutant B0AT1 was demonstrated upon interaction with the associated proteins (Figure 2\nC and D). One possible explanation of why the increase in surface expression did not lead to an increase in transport rate is that ACE2/A69T-B0AT1 heterodimers reaching the cell surface remain inactive, meaning that the associated protein inhibits the function of A69T-B0AT1. The fact that the residue mutated in A69T is part of a highly conserved motif (NGGGAF) shown to undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle is compatible with this hypothesis.24 Additionally, that the coexpression of ACE2 or collectrin apparently activates the transport rate of wild-type B0AT1 several-fold more than it increases its surface expression (\u223c10-fold vs \u223c2.5-fold) also suggests that associated proteins may impact on transporter function, although normally by increasing the cycling rate.",

Interestingly, the D173N allele is relatively frequent in unrelated Hartnup pedigrees and can also be observed in healthy white patients with a high heterozygote frequency (1:122 healthy individuals).2, 25 We know of no potential selective advantage for heterozygous carriers that explains the persistence and geographic spread of this mutant allele.26, 27 The selective functional interaction of D173N with the intestinal accessory protein ACE2 might prevent deleterious effects due to a lack of amino acid absorption and thereby allowing the \u201csurvival\u201d of this frequent allele. Although as yet no evidence of genotype-phenotype relationship performed in patients were reported, studies performed long before the identification of the Hartnup transporter have shown that intestinal amino acid absorption differs between subjects with Hartnup disorder.28, 29\n",

            "text": "Supplementary Figure 2: Functional characterization of the complex formed by human B0AT1 and ACE2 in X laevis oocytes. (A) The amino acid transport by human B0AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 in X laevis oocytes is Na+ but not Cl\u2212 dependent. The ion dependence was tested by substituting Na+ by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) or Li+ and Cl\u2212 by gluconate in the superfusion solution used for TEVC. The values were normalized to the current obtained by superfusion of the oocytes with 10 mmol/L l-isoleucine in solution containing Na+ and Cl\u2212 (Inorm). Comparison of means was performed by analysis of variance with Tukey as posttest. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 16). ***P < .001. (B) Amino acid transport by human B0AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 in X laevis oocytes is maximal at neutral pH. The pH dependence of the transport was measured by TEVC in oocytes clamped at \u201350 mV and superfused with Na+ solution buffered at pH 5.5, 6.5, 7.4, or 8.0. Values were normalized to the current obtained by superfusion of oocytes with 10 mmol/L l-isoleucine in solution pH 7.4 (Inorm). Comparison of means was performed by analysis of variance with Tukey as posttest. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 9). *P < .05, **P < .01. (C\u2013E) Human B0AT1 coexpressed with ACE2 transports a broad range of neutral amino acids with low affinity. (C) The substrate selectivity of human B0AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 was measured by TEVC in oocytes clamped at \u201350 mV and superfused with Na+ solution containing 1 mmol/L (white bars) or 10 mmol/L (black bars) of amino acids. The currents induced by the amino acids were normalized to the currents obtained in oocytes perfused with 10 mmol/L l-isoleucine (Inorm). Data are shown as mean values \u00b1 SEM (n = 8\u201311) and the amino acids are indicated in single letter code. (D and E) The K0.5 and Vmax for l-isoleucine and Na+ of human B0AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 was estimated using TEVC. For the Na+ concentration dependence experiments, the cells were first equilibrated with the indicated Na+ concentration (0, 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 100 mmol/L) before the perfusate containing l-isoleucine (10 mmol/L) was applied. For the l-isoleucine concentration dependence experiments, the cells were perfused with increasing concentrations of l-isoleucine (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mmol/L). The continuous line is the nonlinear regression fit of the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation to the data. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SEM (C, n = 26\u201327; D, n = 10\u201322).",

The symptoms observed were quite diverse between the 2 sisters. The younger one was diagnosed with Hartnup disorder in early childhood due to pellagra-like skin rash and an atactic gait that improved with administration of niacin.1 The older affected sibling never showed skin pathologies or ataxia. (B) Another Danish pedigree, where the only child affected was a compound heterozygous for A69T and the original Hartnup mutation IVS8+2T\u2192G. This patient was the first child of unrelated parents and was diagnosed at 1 year of age after a suspected seizure prompted a metabolic screening of urine. Plasma amino acids and electroencephalography were normal. The patient subsequently had normal growth and development without epilepsy, ataxia, or pellagra. (C) The other Danish patient was a compound heterozygous for P579L and the original Hartnup mutation IVS8+2T\u2192G. This patient was the second child of unrelated parents and was diagnosed at 2 years of age after onset of partial complex epilepsy with great difficulty to control seizures. The patient had normal plasma amino acids and never had ataxia or pellagra. (D) Another patient from a German family was diagnosed as homozygous for the new missense mutation G93R. This patient was diagnosed at 6 years of age during a migraine workup and also never had ataxia or pellagra. The affected subjects are depicted as filled symbols.",
