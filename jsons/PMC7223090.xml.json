In Brazil, the infection is endemic and is maintained in the \u201caerial, sylvatic and rural\u201d cycles, where bats are the main reservoirs. In some regions of the country, such as the northeast and northern regions, the urban cycle, with domestic dogs as reservoirs, is still maintained [4]. In the states of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and Santa Catarina (SC), the most southern Brazilian states, urban rabies has not been detected since the 1980s [5, 6]. Nevertheless, vampire bats of the species Desmodus rotundus, remain as the natural reservoirs of the virus. As D. rotundus preferably feeds on cattle, the endemic character of rabies in cattle is maintained, giving rise to sporadic outbreaks of the disease. Despite the implementation of methods of control, such as reductions in vampire bat populations, vaccination of cattle (though not compulsory) and efforts to improve public awareness on the subject, the endemic status of the infection is maintained, with the occurrence of occasional, often yearly, outbreaks of disease. Such occurrences cause significant burdens to farmers due to the loss of livestock, in addition to causing serious risks of human contamination.",

Such association is important to study the routes of dissemination of the virus. Moreover, the association of particular RABV genetic lineages and the migratory profile of vampire bats may provide useful information in predicting future outbreaks of the disease. Therefore, analyses of genetic lineages of RABV could enable significant advances in the understanding of the epidemiology of infection within a particular region. Here, to investigate the genetic lineages of RABV circulating in RS and SC, phylogenetic analyses of the nucleoprotein gene (N) of RABV were performed on isolates recovered from infected cattle.",

Sublineage 1B appears to have a more restricted geographic distribution, since representatives of this sublineage were recovered only in the northern and eastern regions of the state. Cocirculation of the two sublineages in the same region was detected in two municipalities (Gravata\u00ed and Glorinha, Eastern RS; Fig. 3a).",

            "text": "Vampire bats of the species D. rotundus are distributed throughout Latin America [2]. However, the introduction and dissemination of cattle in the subcontinent have provided a widely available source of food for the species. The states of RS and SC, the two most southern states in Brazil, have been successful in controlling urban rabies transmitted by dogs. However, rural rabies remains endemic, mostly affecting cattle, since the species is the preferred food source for D. rotundus. Vaccination of cattle against rabies is not compulsory as the disease often occurs in outbreaks; farmers sometimes prefer not to vaccinate with the expectation that \u201cthere will be no rabies\u201d on that particular season or year. Consequently, new outbreaks of rabies in cattle can be expected to occur and are invariably associated with the presence of infected vampire bats in the region. However, more detailed studies aiming to investigate the genetic lineages of RABV that may be circulating in southern Brazil are scarce [16, 23\u201325]. In view of this scarcity, in the present study, the coding region sequences of the RABV N gene from isolates recovered from infected cattle in the states of RS and SC were sequenced and compared to equivalent sequences available in GenBank. Such an approach has been used in a number of previous studies [7, 8, 21, 23, 24]. Through examination of the topology of the phylogenetic tree generated by the analyses, two genetic sublineages of RABV (1A and 1B) were identified to be circulating in southern Brazil, both having the vampire bat D. rotundus as their natural reservoir.",
