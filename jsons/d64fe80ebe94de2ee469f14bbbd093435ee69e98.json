Unlike the other 6 identified coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety of manifestations. In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission. Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience. These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve 'zero infection' of doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight 2019-nCoV infection.",

Fortunately, the Chinese government made a rapid and effective response to this situation and made a great progress in protecting citizens from virus transmission. Wuhan City became the battlefront to fight COVID-19, and most doctors devoted themselves to this white war. Under novel coronavirus pneumonia situation, regular clinical work in the local hospital was seriously restricted. Especially, it became much more challenging to deal with the surgical requests for patients with central nervous system (CNS) diseases. As the largest neurosurgical center in Wuhan, Neurosurgery Department of Tongji Hospital performed surgical treatments for patients in the epidemic situation. We carried out some management proposals of the patients on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and clinical experiences.
