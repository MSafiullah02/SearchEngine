            "text": "The type I interferon (IFN) system constitutes the first line of host defence against viral invasions (Borden et al., 2007). The antiviral effects of type I IFN, which includes IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2, are mainly mediated by a great diversity of IFN\u2010stimulating genes (ISGs). The binding of IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 to their receptors represents the first step in this signalling transduction, followed by activation of the JAK/STAT cascade, a well\u2010established major pathway that transmits IFN signals (Murray, 2007). Ligand binding then activates the JAK family, which subsequently phosphorylates STAT1 and STAT2 at Y701 and Y690 by JAK1 and Tyk2, respectively (Levy & Darnell, 2002; Uze, Schreiber, Piehler, & Pellegrini, 2007). These phosphorylated STATs dimerise and form a heterotrimer together with IFF9, called IFN\u2010stimulated gene (ISG) factor 3, which then initiates the gene transcription of ISGs, such as OAS2, MX2, CXCL10, IFIT3, and IFITM3 (Tang et al., 2007). The JAK/STAT cascade is tightly regulated by several key endogenous cellular mechanisms. Among them, several molecules, such as SOCS1 and SOCS3, can restrict type I IFN signalling by target JAK/STAT cascade response (Alexander, 2002; Giordanetto & Kroemer, 2003; Larsen & Ropke, 2002). ISGs can also be negatively regulated. For example, IFITM3, a cell\u2010intrinsic factor, which is reported to limit SARS coronavirus, HIV, Ebola virus, and influenza virus, can be degraded through ubiquitination by NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Chesarino, McMichael, & Yount, 2015).",

            "text": "Similar to many other viruses, influenza viruses have acquired multiple strategies to cripple cellular antiviral responses. For example, the NS1 protein of influenza virus has been demonstrated as the main antagonistic factor of host IFN\u2010\u03b2 production via inhibition of the RIG\u2010I\u2010MAVS signalling pathway (Krug, 2015; Pachler & Vlasak, 2011; Rajsbaum et al., 2012), and the PB1\u2010F2 protein was identified to block IFN\u2010\u03b2 induction by targeting MAVS (Varga, Grant, Manicassamy, & Palese, 2012; Varga et al., 2011). Influenza virus can also modulate the antiviral response at the JAK/STAT pathway level. The HA protein was shown to antagonise the IFN response by inducing the degradation of type I IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) (Xia et al., 2015). The NS1 protein was demonstrated to negatively regulate JAK/STAT signalling by elevating SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression (Jia et al., 2010). In addition, influenza virus can restrict JAK/STAT pathway activation via the NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent induction of SOCS3 expression (Pauli et al., 2008).",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding small RNA molecules, which can regulate gene expressions by binding to the 3\u2032\u2010untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of targeted mRNA to induce degradation or suppress translation (Ambros, 2004). Growing evidence has shown that miRNAs are involved in regulating development, apoptosis, host immunity, and viral infection (Bartel, 2004; Cullen, 2013; Wienholds & Plasterk, 2005). MiRNAs can regulate viral infection by modulating the antiviral immune response at multiple levels. MiR\u2010146 was shown to inhibit type I IFN production by regulating expressions of IRAK1, IRAK2, and TRAF6 (Hou et al., 2009), and miR\u20103570 was found to modulate MAVS expression following rhabdovirus infection (Xu, Chu, Cui, & Bi, 2018). Many studies have demonstrated the significant effect of miRNAs on modulating influenza virus infection. For examples, miR\u201033a was suggest to disrupt influenza A virus (IAV) replication by targeting APCN1 (Hu et al., 2016); miR\u201034a contributed to influenza virus\u2010mediated apoptosis by binding to BAX (Fan & Wang, 2016); and miR\u2010let\u20107c targeted and inhibited M1 expression of the H1N1 influenza virus (Ma et al., 2012). Although several studies linked miRNAs to type I IFN production mediated by RIG\u2010I in influenza virus infection (miR\u2010144, miR\u2010485, and miR\u2010136) (Ingle et al., 2015; Rosenberger et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2015), the underlying regulation of the type I IFN\u2010mediated antiviral response by miRNAs during influenza virus infection remains unclear.",

Further analysis demonstrated that miR\u201030 overexpression suppressed SOCS1, SOCS3, and NEDD4 and thus positively regulated the type I IFN signalling pathway and IFITM3 expression, thereby inhibiting influenza virus infection. For the first time, we identified miR\u201030 as a positive regulator of the antiviral response, and our data revealed that influenza virus could disrupt the host antiviral immune response by downregulating miR\u201030 expression, which may be a new mechanism of influenza virus inhibition of the host antiviral immune response.",

Previous studies suggested that miR\u201030 family members (miR\u201030) expression could be modulated by IAV challenge (Y. Li et al., 2010; Y. Li et al., 2011; Tambyah et al., 2013). We hypothesised that miR\u201030 may exert some important effects on influenza virus infection. Human miR\u201030 family contains five members (miR\u201030a\u2013e), which are broadly conserved. We first assessed miR\u201030 expression in A549 cells infected with H5N1 influenza virus in a time\u2010course assay. Sequence analysis indicated that only one or two nucleotides differed among miR\u201030a, miR\u201030d, and miR\u201030e, which have large differences in their 3\u2032 terminals compared with miR\u201030b and miR\u201030c, while miR\u201030b and miR\u201030c have significant differences in their 3\u2032 terminal sequences (Figure S1). Therefore, each member of miR\u201030 family could be analysed using three specific primers: miR\u201030a (which cross\u2010reacts with miR\u201030d and miR\u201030e), miR\u201030b, and miR\u201030c. Our results showed that miR\u201030a/d/e, miR\u201030b, and miR\u201030c were remarkably decreased in A549 cells in a time\u2010dependent manner following H5N1 infection (Figure 1a\u2013c). However, their expression was not substantially changed at 36 hr post\u2010infection (hpi) when A549 cells were treated with heat\u2010inactivated viruses (Figure 1d). MiR\u201030 expression was also decreased in H1N1 and H9N2 subtype influenza virus\u2010infected A549 cells compared with uninfected cells (Figure S2). Poly(I:C), a double\u2010stranded RNA analogue that can activate type I IFN response, was used as a stimulus to investigate miR\u201030 expression. Although poly(I:C) significantly increased IFN\u2010\u03b2 and MX1 expression (Figure 1e), it did not alter miR\u201030 expression (Figure 1f). Additionally, VSV, another RNA virus, did not downregulate miR\u201030 expression (Figure 1g,h). These results strongly indicate that miR\u201030 expression can be downregulated in A549 cells upon IAV infection, and this change is dependent on influenza virus replication.",

As shown in Figure 2a,b, overexpression of miR\u201030a/b/c decreased the influenza virus NP mRNA and protein levels compared with those of the miRNA NC group. Viral titre from the infected A549 cells was also determined. Consistent with the results of the NP mRNA analysis, miR\u201030a/b/c mimic transfection significantly suppressed influenza virus proliferation (Figure 2c). MiR\u201030a, b, or c mimics transfection also significantly inhibited influenza virus proliferation in primary human alveolar epithelia cells (HAECs) (Figure S3). To further show the effect of miR\u201030 on influenza virus infection, we assessed viral infection in the presence of the miR\u201030a/b/c inhibitors at different times. The data indicated that miR\u201030a/b/c inhibitors significantly promoted viral NP expression (Figure 2d,e) and viral titres in the supernatant (Figure 2f). Given the high sequence similarity of miR\u201030a, miR\u201030d, and miR\u201030e, we did not determine the effect of miR\u201030d and miR\u201030e on influenza virus infection, but we hypothesised that they have the same role as miR\u201030a/b/c in influenza virus infection.

As shown in Figure 4, miR\u201030a/b/c mimic transfection significantly inhibited SOCS1 (Figure 4h) and SOCS3 mRNA levels (Figure 4i), whereas SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression could be restored by inhibitors. As expected, the SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein levels were also significantly decreased following miR\u201030a/b/c overexpression (Figure 4j). MiR\u201030a/b/c overexpression also significantly reduced SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, including mRNA and protein level in HAECs (Figure S5A,B). In contrast, miR\u201030a/b/c inhibitors increased the SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein levels (Figure 4k). These data indicated that miR\u201030a/b/c functioned similarly in regulating SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, which may be due to their identical seed region and high sequence similarity (Figure S1). Above all, these results demonstrated that miR\u201030 negatively regulates SOCS1 and SOCS3 at the transcriptional level by targeting SOCS1 and SOCS3 3\u2032UTRs.",

NEDD4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that was reported to promote IAV infection by downregulating the antiviral protein IFITM3 expression (Chesarino et al., 2015). Thus, we investigated whether miR\u201030 can target NEDD4. The luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that overexpression of miR\u201030a/b/c significantly decreased the luciferase activity of the NEDD4\u2010WT 3\u2032UTR (Figure 5b), and dose\u2010dependent inhibitory effects were observed (Figure 5c). In addition, the luciferase activity was slightly inhibited by miR\u201030a/b/c inhibitor transfection (Figure 5d). When miR\u201030a/b/c were transfected together with the NEDD4 3\u2032UTR containing a mutation in position 960\u2013967 (NEDD4\u2010Mut2), the inhibitory effect of miR\u201030a/b/c was not observed; miR\u201030a/b/c mimic transfection also substantially inhibited the luciferase activities of NEDD4\u2010Mut1 and NEDD4\u2010Mut3, which contained mutations at 942\u2013949 and 1116\u20131122 in the predicted binding sites, respectively (Figure 5b).

            "text": "In addition to cellular gene expression regulation, miRNAs have been demonstrated to be critical in virus infection, either by targeting viral gene transcripts or by regulating host antiviral response. Thus, the finding that viruses, including influenza virus, modulate the expression of specific cellular miRNAs is not surprising. The miR\u201030 family was shown to participate in development, apoptosis, and autophagy (Agrawal, Tran, & Wessely, 2009; J. Li et al., 2010; Pan et al., 2013). Previously, several groups reported that the expression of miR\u201030 family members was reduced by influenza virus invasion (Y. Li et al., 2010; Y. Li et al., 2011; Tambyah et al., 2013). However, the exact function of miR\u201030 in influenza virus infection has not been determined. Herein, we showed that miR\u201030 family members were downregulated by IAV infection. The regulation of miR\u201030 family members by IAV infection appears to be independent of subtype, as the H1N1 and H9N2 subtypes also altered the miR\u201030 levels (Figure S2). Interestingly, miR\u201030 was not affected by VSV infection and poly(I:C) stimulation in A549 cells. Previous studies reported that miR\u201030a and miR\u201030d were reduced upon West Nile virus infection in HEK293 cells, while miR\u201030c was increased by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in porcine alveolar macrophages (Zhang et al., 2016). It is likely that miR\u201030 family members can be differentially modulated by various stimulants. Notably, because heat\u2010inactivated virus failed to alter the levels of miR\u201030 family members, and individual overexpression of a virus\u2010coding protein did not influence miR\u201030 expression (data not shown), we speculated that the downregulation of miR\u201030 is dependent on influenza virus replication. However, our attempt to discover the mechanism by which influenza virus infection decreases miR\u201030 levels failed. We hypothesised that influenza virus infection may affect the transcription of miR\u201030 by acting on promoters or through oxidative stress induced by virus infection because influenza virus infection was shown to lead to oxidative stress, which was suggested to reduce the expression of miR\u201030 family members in a previous study (J. Li et al., 2010). This mechanism requires further investigation.",

MiR\u201030 was reported to participate in various biological processes by targeting different host genes, such as p53, ATG5, BECIN1, and Xlim1/Lhx1 (Agrawal et al., 2009; J. Li et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012). In this report, we demonstrated that miR\u201030 directly targets SOCS1, SOCS3, and NEDD4, which are negative regulators of the antiviral response pathway. Interestingly, a previous study reported that miR\u201030 can target JAK1 to positively modulate the IFN response in porcine Marc\u2010145 and PAM cells (Zhang et al., 2016). However, in our experiments, miR\u201030 did not target JAK1 in A549 cells, as shown by dual\u2010luciferase reporter assays and real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR; data not shown). This discrepancy could be due to the different physiological conditions of the different cell types used in our experiment. It seems that the main targets for one specific miRNA often variable under different physical or pathological conditions or in different cell types to play diverse functions.",

            "text": "Influenza virus has devised multiple strategies to attenuate the type I IFN\u2010mediated antiviral response. Viral coding proteins (NS1, PB2, and PB1\u2010F2) were reported to disrupt the signalling pathways of type I IFN synthesis. In addition to the blockade of IFN production, influenza virus can also inhibit JAK/STAT pathway activation to prevent ISG expression. The influenza virus NS1 protein can inhibit JAK/STAT signalling pathway activation by increasing SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression; in addition, influenza viral proteins antagonise the functions of ISG, such as PB2, which was reported to inhibit mouse Mx1 function (Stranden, Staeheli, & Pavlovic, 1993). However, whether miRNAs participate in influenza virus\u2010mediated inhibition of type I IFN\u2010mediated antiviral responses is not very clear. In this study, we described a new strategy used by influenza virus to antagonise the type I IFN signalling pathway by decreasing host conserved miRNA expression (miR\u201030 family members). MiR\u201030 was shown to be a positive regulator of the antiviral response through inhibiting SOCS1, SOCS3, and NEDD4 expression in this study. However, it is hard to verify whether miR\u201030 is more or less important in viral pathogenesis than other reported mechanisms. Nevertheless, influenza virus may promote its own survival by decreasing miR\u201030 via cooperation with its coding proteins to interfere with the type I IFN\u2010mediated antiviral response. The antiviral immune response is regulated in an accurate and sophisticated manner by multiple regulators, both negative and positive. The mechanisms of influenza virus\u2010mediated immune evasion, through viral proteins or host molecules, are also complicated. Other miRNAs are likely involved in modulating influenza virus infection and virus\u2010mediated immune evasion. Because one miRNA may act as a counterbalance to another, the overall function of these miRNAs in influenza virus infection may not be apparent. In addition to the miRNAs that showed substantial changes following influenza virus infection, miRNAs that showed little alteration may also function in viral infection via the cumulative impact of all or most of them, even if a single miRNA has little effect. Although we showed that miR\u201030 is used by influenza virus to counter the host antiviral immune response, we believe that further studies on miRNAs that participate in influenza virus infection are needed.",
