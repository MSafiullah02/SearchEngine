In the context of such emergencies, WHO must at times provide global leadership within hours to days. Such guidelines are termed as \u201cemergency (rapid response) guidelines\u201d and processes and methods for producing such guidelines are currently under development at WHO [1]. However, if a public health emergency continues and as response efforts evolve into recovery and rebuilding, guidelines are needed that are developed using more rigorous methods and generally with a somewhat longer timeline: perhaps 1 to 3 months. These are termed \u201crapid advice guidelines\u201d and are the focus of this paper.Box 1Types of WHO guidelines [1]There are four main types of guidelines produced by WHO that comprise a broad spectrum of products that vary mainly in terms of the following features:\u25aaPurpose;\u25aaScope;\u25aaThe point in time at which the guideline is being developed relative to the life span of an intervention;\u25aaThe organizations or entities developing the guideline;\u25aaThe presence in the guideline of new vs. previously published recommendations; and\u25aaThe timeline.1.Standard guidelines\u25aaPurpose\u2014to provide recommendations on a specific topic or condition;\u25aaScope\u2014focused or comprehensive;\u25aaDeveloper\u2014WHO technical staff;\u25aaNew or existing recommendations\u2014usually new; may contain existing recommendations if they have been evaluated and updated as appropriate;\u25aaDevelopment period\u20146 months to 2 years.\n2.Consolidated guidelines\u25aaPurpose\u2014to aggregate all the existing guidance on a disease or condition;\u25aaScope\u2014comprehensive;\u25aaDeveloper\u2014WHO technical staff;\u25aaNew or existing recommendations\u2014existing recommendations that have been evaluated and found to be up to date; may contain some new recommendations;\u25aaDevelopment period\u20141 to 2 years.\n3.Interim guidelines\u25aaPurpose\u2014to provide guidance when new interventions, exposures, or diseases arise or when new evidence becomes available or data are likely to be incomplete;\u25aaScope\u2014focused;\u25aaDeveloper\u2014WHO technical staff;\u25aaNew or existing recommendations\u2014new;\u25aaDevelopment period\u20146 to 9 months.\n4.Guidelines in response to an emergency or urgent needThere are two basic types:Emergency (rapid response) guidelines\u25aaPurpose\u2014produced when public health emergencies may necessitate a response from WHO within hours to days;\u25aaFurther guidance on this type of guideline is under development at WHO.\nRapid advice guidelines\u25aaPurpose\u2014to meet an emergent or urgent public health need when the short timeline mandates a modified process;\u25aaScope\u2014focused;\u25aaDeveloper\u2014WHO technical staff;\u25aaNew or existing recommendations\u2014usually new; may contain existing recommendations if they have been evaluated and updated as appropriate;\u25aaDevelopment period\u2014usually 1 to 3 months.\n\n\n\nAbbreviation: WHO, World Health Organization.Alt-text: Box 1",

To date, WHO has published two rapid advice guidelines based on this approach, both developed in 2014 in the context of the filovirus (Ebola) outbreak: one examining hand hygiene and the use of chlorine; [2] the other on the effectiveness of various components of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers [3]. Although we began development of methods specific to WHO rapid advice guidelines before the Ebola crisis emerged, it is a compelling example of how we were able to apply these newly developed methods and finalize them based on lessons learned in the context of Ebola (see Box 2\n).Box 2An example of a rapid advice guideline developedPersonal protective equipment in the context of filovirus disease outbreak response: Rapid advice guideline (2014). World Health Organization.Context\u25aaA public health emergency of international concern.\nIssue\u25aaHealthcare workers caring for individuals with Ebola were at an increased risk of contracting Ebola virus disease during the outbreak in West Africa starting in 2013.\u25aaThere was uncertainty in the field as to the most effective types of personal protective equipment (PPE).\nDevelopment of a WHO rapid advice guideline\u25aaA rapid review (RR) was conducted over 7 weeks to inform the recommendations [4].\u25aaInitially, the RR focused on the comparative effectiveness and disadvantages of PPE (gloves, gowns, and face protection) for healthcare workers working with Ebola patients. However, only noncomparative studies were identified.\u25aaConcurrent with the RR, a survey of values and preferences was administered to expatriated healthcare workers over a 3-week period, which helped to inform recommendations.\u25aaThe noncomparative data from the RR, the survey data, and information from experts in virology and bloodborne pathogens and materials science formed the basis for the recommendations which were formulated at an expert meeting.\nSignificance\u25aaProduced over a 12-week time frame [3], this marked the first rapid advice guideline produced by WHO following the approaches outlined herein.\n\n\nAbbreviation: WHO, World Health Organization.Alt-text: Box 2",

Since that publication, the term \u201crapid\u201d has been used in the title of several WHO guidelines. However, none of these guidelines was, in fact, produced rapidly, and none reported using unique or modified approaches: rather they described standard approaches in the context of efforts to produce the guideline rapidly.

However, there are important differences: the rapid review may have a more limited scope and fewer outcomes of interest, more restricted search criteria, looks to existing high-quality systematic reviews as the first line of evidence, involves a more targeted and iterative procedure for screening the literature and for data analysis and synthesis, places less emphasis on meta-analyses, and involves a concise and abbreviated report. In addition, in a rapid review, the search process is more iterative and hierarchical, depending on the findings at each step: the types of publication and study designs included and the bibliographic databases searched may change as the evidence is explored. Other efficiencies may be achieved by, for example, adding more resources so that reviewers can work in parallel.",

These differences, in turn, may affect the credibility of the review and the validity of the review's conclusions. Given that interest in rapid reviews has increased and there is great variability in the approaches and level of reporting [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], future research needs to address how rapid reviews compare with standard systematic reviews in terms of bias and credibility, with further guidance developed on when and how to conduct a rapid review. Rapid reviews have become an area of new methodological development for several health research organizations. The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has established a rapid reviews workgroup [20]. Cochrane, the world's largest producer of high-quality systematic reviews of effectiveness, recently established the Cochrane Methods Rapid Reviews Group [21]. Further, due to the increased interest of public authorities and clinicians, the Guidelines-International-Network established a working group dedicated to the methods for developing guidelines in an accelerated time frame [22].",
