FA1 shared the same bedroom with F2 and F6.

On the afternoon of Jan 20th, FA1 started to show symptoms of a fever and dry cough, while other members of the family hadn't shown any symptoms. On Jan 21st, all the elders within the family (i.e. FA1, FA2, FA3) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. FA2 never showed any symptoms during the whole course of disease, but a CT chest scan suggested pathological changes in both lungs. FA3 had muscle soreness and chills between Jan 23rd and 31st, and a chest CT scan performed on Feb 3rd showed resolving inflammation in both lungs. One child (FA5) tested negative and remained symptom free for the whole period of this study. On the other hand, FA4 was PCR positive before the onset of disease (fatigue and headache), whereas FA-6 had a fever one day before she tested PCR positive. Neither FA4 nor FA6 showed any abnormality in their chest CT scans. All members of the family were released from hospital by Feb 14th.",

In Beijing, she stayed in her daughter's (FB1) house.

All the above-mentioned family members contracted COVID-19. The earliest onset of disease occurred on Jan 23rd and included FB1 and her mother (FB2) and father (FB3), and the latest was FB6 on Jan 31st. Meanwhile, PCR assays were performed frequently after the index case and all family members became PCR positive between the period Jan 28th and Feb 2nd. Importantly, FB1 had been sick for 8 days before she was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, FB6 (father-in-law) was first tested positive by PCR (Jan 29th) before he became sick on Jan 31st, indicating virus shedding before the onset of disease. FB6 became PCR negative on Feb 26th. From the incubation of the index case to becoming PCR negative, there was a period of just over one month. As of Mar 6th, three of the family members were still hospitalized.",

The virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract usually followed the onset of symptoms, but in some of the cases it preceded any symptoms (Fig. 1).

One child didn't have symptoms and the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 virus remained negative. Previous studies showed that children appear to have milder infections than adults.9 All the children with positive PCR results became negative after 5-17 days. For the adults, the PCR remained positive much longer, some for over 28 days. In addition, we have shown that viral shedding can precede the onset of symptoms, which may contribute to the spread of this virus. Another interesting observation is that there seemed to be differences in the onset and duration viral shedding between family clusters, suggesting the possible differences in virulence of the viruses, which merits further investigation with the inclusion of the virus genome data.",
