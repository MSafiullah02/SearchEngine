            "text": "This chapter will focus on manuscripts published during the past 10 years (from 2005\u20132013) that focus on design and properties of recombinant attenuated bacterial vaccine (RABV) delivery of antigens and DNA vaccine vectors. These vaccine delivery systems were developed for administration on or through mucosal surfaces to prevent infection by bacterial, viral, and parasite pathogens that cause disease on or invade through mucosal surfaces. I have therefore not included reference to use of these vector systems to confer protection against insect-borne pathogens or in cases not using a mucosal route of immunization or not measuring any mucosal antibody or cellular immune responses. Readers are referred to the chapter in the previous edition of this book (Curtiss, 2005), as well as to recent reviews (Curtiss, 2002, Cheminay and Hensel, 2008, Van Huynegem et al., 2009, Galen et al., 2009, Hegazy and Hensel, 2012, Simon et al., 2011, Bahey-El-Din and Gahan, 2011, Berlec et al., 2012, Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2011, Mohamadzadeh, 2010, Wells, 2011) for discussion of prior work and for additional perspectives and information. Other reviews also address means for vaccines to induce mucosal as well as systemic and cellular immunities based on mucosal routes of immunization (Pasetti et al., 2011, Anjuere et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2012a, Kong et al., 2012b). In regard to Salmonella vectored vaccines, there is a critical need for Peyer\u2019s patches (PP) to induce a mucosal immune response with production of secretory IgA (SIgA) after oral immunization (Hashizume et al., 2008). Whether PP are needed to induce mucosal S-IgA responses when the recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine (RASV) is administered via other mucosal routes or by parenteral immunization has so far not been examined. However, Seo et al. (2010) have used eye drop immunization with an RASV to induce mucosal antibodies assayed in vaginal secretions and also induce protection to challenge with a wild-type virulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain. Previous work (Hopkins et al., 1995) had demonstrated that delivery of an RASV strain by diverse mucosal routes induced antibodies in distal mucosal sites, as well as in serum, except for rectal immunization, which only resulted in mucosal responses in the intestinal tract. In contrast, Kantele et al. (1998) observed that rectal immunization of human volunteers with antityphoid vaccine strain Ty21a induced better mucosal immune responses in nasal and rectal secretions and tears than did oral administration, which induced better mucosal responses in saliva and vaginal secretions. Both routes were equivalent in inducing mucosal responses in intestinal secretions and in serum. Other studies (Srinivasan et al., 1995) confirmed Hopkin\u2019s results in mice, finding antibody responses in secretions and in serum following oral, intranasal, and intravaginal immunization, and also observed this to be true for intraperitoneal immunization. This may be a unique attribute of RASVs since Salmonella vaccines do colonize the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in mice following intraperitoneal immunization. This is also possibly true for other invasive vaccine vectors with the potential to colonize diverse internal effector lymphoid tissues after parenteral inoculation. It is apparent that more studies comparing mice and humans and routes of immunization are needed. It is now evident from the increasing number of studies using noninvasive lactic acid bacteria as antigen delivery vectors that invasion is not necessary to induce mucosal responses. In these regards, it would be valuable to have comparative studies with different bacterial vector systems using the same protective antigens, strain of mice, and immunological evaluations, including challenge with the same pathogen strain. It would be particularly important in these studies to evaluate duration of immunity and protection and the induction of memory responses.",

Edwardsiella, Listeria, Mycobacterium, Shigella, and Yersinia are other invasive bacteria used while Clostridium, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio are used as noninvasive vaccine vectors. In reviewing the literature on RABVs, one must remember that not all parental isolates used in various studies are the same; while an attenuated derivative of one strain can induce protection against itself and other strains, the reciprocal is not necessarily so (Zhang et al., 1997). In other words, different strains of the same species also have differences in the degrees to which they are able to induce protective immunity. Also, the choice of outbred versus specific inbred strains of mice and the antigen studied can significantly impact the results in induction of immune responses and protective immunity (Sbrogio-Almeida et al., 2004, Simon et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The objective of mucosally delivered vaccines is to induce mucosal antibody and cellular immune responses at portals of entry of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasite pathogens. Although immunization via any route will induce mucosal responses at other mucosal sites, there is often a much better response, at least a short-term response, in the mucosal site used for primary immunization. Unfortunately, the impact of route of immunization on duration of response and memory has not been adequately studied. Although the oral route of immunization is most often used for invasive Salmonella vectored vaccines, especially for S. enterica serotype Typhimurium (hereafter S. Typhimurium) in mice and other animals, an increasing number of studies most often when evaluating human adapted S. enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A (hereafter S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A) in mice have used intranasal (i.n.) immunization (see Pickett et al., 2000, Galen et al., 2010). In the increasing number of studies using Lactobacillus-vectored vaccines, the i.n. route has now almost become the norm. While I fully subscribe to investigating vaccines in ways to most readily assess what works and what works best, I must remind readers and investigators that i.n. administered vaccines are unlikely to ever be approved for human use unless means to preclude access of bacteria and their products administered by the i.n. route to the brain are discovered and implemented. This problem has been clearly demonstrated for wild-type S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi, as well as their attenuated derivatives, which after i.n. inoculation traverse along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to the olfactory bulb and then to the brain (Bollen et al., 2008). Eliminating the SPI-1 inv genes did not block this brain access. In this regard, other vaccines administered i.n. have been taken off the market, and it is well known that S. Typhi infection in children can result in meningitis (Henderson, 1948). Even oral infection of mice with wild-type strains can result in neurological symptoms associated with brain colonization (Wickham et al., 2007). It therefore might be worth a more complete investigation of using the sublingual route of immunization (Cuburu et al., 2007). While these issues are particularly relevant when using live invasive bacterial strains as vaccine vectors, problems might also be encountered when using noninvasive bacterial vectors. This is particularly true in that a preponderance of recent studies with lactic acid bacterial vectors has observed much better efficacy in using i.n. immunization compared to oral delivery.",

            "text": "An important feature of highly immunogenic live bacterial vaccine vectors is that they recruit innate immune responses that are usually accompanied by an inflammatory response. However, too much of a good thing is not always acceptable. Thus, using invasive bacterial vectors can possibly lead to too much inflammation. Those using S. Typhimurium in mice may never realize this since mice do not get gastroenteritis from S. Typhimurium infections. Thus, safety and evaluation of the degree of excessive inflammatory responses associated with invasive RABVs should probably be evaluated using rabbit ileal loop assays or calves. Bollen et al. (2008), using rabbit ileal loops, found that inclusion of sopB and/or msbB mutations in S. Typhimurium decreased excessive fluid secretion and inflammatory responses. More recently, Kong et al., (2011b) genetically modified S. Typhimurium to synthesize mostly monophosphoryl lipid A, which is the nontoxic adjuvant form of lipid A, and showed that this strain was not excessively inflammatory in rabbit ileal loop studies. Vaccine strains with this modification were highly immunogenic. These considerations are likely important for S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A vectored vaccines in humans since mild diarrhea has been observed in some subjects in some trials (Tacket et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Much of the early focus in developing RASVs for humans was in selecting attenuation strategies that would be safe and efficacious in healthy young adults (18- to 40-year-olds), because of FDA guidelines. Fortunately, these were not well codified when Germanier and Furer (1975) described the attenuated S. Typhi Ty21a vaccine and clinical trial success soon led to its testing for safety and efficacy in young children in Chile (Black et al., 1990). In the early 2000s, there was a global effort to identify the major Grand Challenges in Global Health and after much deliberation, 14 such Grand Challenges were selected. The first three were to develop (1) safe, efficacious vaccines for newborns, (2) vaccines to be delivered needle-free, and (3) vaccines to be thermostable. We thus spent several years in evaluating various combinations of attenuating mutations to render S. Typhimurium totally safe for newborn mice while retaining immunogenicity. One such strain, S. Typhimurium \u03c79558, was found to be totally safe at doses in excess of 108\n CFU in newborn mice (Gunn et al., 2010) when the LD50 for the wild-type parent was 10. This strain, mostly constructed by Bronwyn Gunn with help from others, was unable to colonize the brain after i.n. immunization (Bollen et al., 2008) was immunogenic in adult (Li et al., 2009b), infant (Shi et al., 2010a), malnourished (O. Wijburg et al., unpublished), and immunocompromised (O. Wijburg et al., unpublished) mice. S. Typhi vaccine strains with the same mutations as \u03c79558 have been evaluated and found to be safe in human volunteers (Frey et al., 2013). Periaswamy et al. (2012) screened for secondary mutations in an S. Typhimurium strain with an ssaV attenuating mutation and identified some that conferred safety in immunocompromised mice and yet retained immunogenicity. Vishwakarma et al. (2012) reported that a \u0394ssaV fur double mutant was safe and immunogenic in some strains of immunocompromised mice. However, the involvement of Fur in upregulating hilD expression and thus in enhancing SPI-1 invasion functions (Teixido et al., 2011) would suggest that inclusion of a fur mutation in a vaccine strain would lessen invasion and thus immunogenicity. Peters et al. (2010) introduced a trxA deletion to eliminate thioredoxin and reduce inflammation and splenomegaly in i.v. immunized mice. While attenuated, the mutant strain still induced protection to the Salmonella challenge, even though numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells and B lymphocytes in the spleen were reduced.",

            "text": "Since gene cloning and early recombinant DNA manipulations very much relied on plasmid vectors and antibiotic resistance markers to select recombinant clones (Cohen et al., 1973), it follows that much of the work in developing live recombinant bacterial vaccines also used plasmid vectors with antibiotic-resistance markers for selection. However, in the late 1980s, scientists at the USDA and the FDA let it be known that antibiotic resistance would not be a good attribute to have in live bacterial vaccines. The use of balanced-lethal vector-host systems (Nakayama et al., 1988, Galan et al., 1990) and the hok-sok plasmid addiction system (Galen et al., 1999) to eliminate the use of plasmids or strains with antibiotic resistance were reviewed previously (Curtiss, 2005). As a new system, Garmory et al. (2005) described construction of an operator-repressor titration (ORT) system for maintenance of plasmid vectors in a host strain in vivo, in the absence of either drug resistance or other selective markers. The system involves insertion of the lacI (or lacI\nq sequence in opposite orientation to Ptac (or Ptrc or Plac)) with the lacO sequence intact to drive expression of an adjacent-essential gene such as dapD. Growth of this strain was dependent on addition of IPTG. However, introducing a plasmid-encoding, protective antigen with the lacO sequence titrated LacI and enabled the strain to grow in the absence of IPTG. Loss of the plasmid caused the vaccine cell to undergo a diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-less death and lyse. Garmory et al. (2005) reported that this construction delivering the Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) F1 antigen was very efficient and induced complete protection to the Y. pestis challenge after a single oral immunization. Galen et al. (2010) developed an additional novel means for stable maintenance of plasmid vectors in the absence of antibiotic resistance. They deleted the gene encoding a single-stranded DNA binding protein, essential for DNA metabolism, and placed the gene on antigen-specifying plasmids. Introducing the lethal mutation into the chromosome of vaccine strains requires use of a maintenance plasmid to be replaced by the antigen-specifying plasmid for final RASV construction. Xin et al. (2012) describe an additional balanced-lethal plasmid maintenance system relating to the requirement of d-alanine for peptidoglycan synthesis.",

(2002a) developed a suicide vector approach to generate precise deletions, with or without insertions, that makes use of counterselection using kanamycin or chloramphenicol resistance for initial selection and sucrose sensitivity due to the presence of the sacB gene for selection in the reverse direction. Once created, the mutation can be quickly moved from one strain to another using P22-mediated transduction. Husseiny and Hensel, 2005, Husseiny and Hensel, 2008 have described an adaptation of the \u03bbred-based system, described by Datsenko and Wanner (2000) for E. coli to enable repetitive deletions and insertions (often of expression cassettes) in the S. Typhimurium chromosome. The system also only uses antibiotic resistance genes transiently with the final constructs being antibiotic-sensitive. One potential complication is the accumulation of multiple FRT scars (FLP recombinase recognition target of 82\u201385 nt) in place of each deletion that could lead to potential genetic instability. Some regulatory scientists dislike these, as well as antibiotic resistance in live vaccine strains. Sun et al. (2008) therefore developed a strategy analogous to that proposed by Husseiny and Hensel (2005) for both Salmonella and Yersinia that generates multiple scarless genetic modifications. The suicide vector, coupled with the P22 transduction method of Kang et al., (2002a), also avoids the problem with DNA scars. Kwon et al. (2007) has also used fusion of a unique 18-bp sequence to a sequence encoding antibiotic resistance to insert in place of a chromosomal deleted sequence and then use the homing nuclease I-SceI (Kang et al., 2004) that recognizes this unique 18-bp sequence for excision to generate scarless allele deletions and replacements.",

Success in developing a bacterial vaccine vector system is therefore dependent on identifying and then inactivating these means. The SopB protein of S. Typhimurium is an effector secreted by the SPI-1 T3SS that prevents induction of apoptosis (pyroptosis), which is advantageous for Salmonella rather than the host (Knodler et al., 2005). Deletion of the sopB gene in a vaccine strain lessens induction of fluid secretion in the intestinal tract (Gunn et al., 2010), without decreasing invasion and also enhances induction of mucosal immune responses (Li et al., 2008). Jones et al. (2008) report that the S. Typhimurium avrA gene acts to subvert innate and apoptotic signaling pathways. Further studies (Wu et al., 2012) revealed, however, that S. Typhimurium with a \u0394avrA mutation caused more extensive intestinal inflammation, led to increased apoptosis of epithelial cells, and achieved higher titers in internal organs, including the spleen. St. John and Abraham (2009) reported that S. Typhimurium LPS via a TLR4-mediated process downregulate production of the homeostatic chemokines CCL21 and CXCL13, which impact functional organization of the draining lymph nodes. It is likely that the modification of S. Typhimurium lipid A to the 1-dephosphorylated form (Kong et al., 2011a) eliminates this problem. Kullas et al. (2012) reported that S. Typhimurium produces an l-asparaginase II enzyme encoded by the ansB gene that enhances virulence by inhibiting T cell responses.",

It remains to be seen whether mutations or other genetic alterations that lessen induction of immune suppression by S. Typhimurium in mice will be applicable to S. Typhi in humans. On the other hand, the Vi antigen is a protective antigen and is used as a conjugate vaccine to prevent S. Typhi infection (Kossaczka et al., 1999). Wahid et al.

            "text": "For years, the majority of papers and reviews on live bacterial vaccines have noted the importance of ensuring complete attenuation with induction of no disease symptoms while maintaining high immunogenicity. I finally realized that this was improbable, if not impossible. We thus devised a number of strategies so that the vaccine strain at the time of administration would be as nearly like the wild-type pathogen as possible, in being able to withstand the host defenses and stresses encountered in colonizing targeted effector lymphoid tissues. The first strategy was to design strains with regulated delayed attenuation. We have achieved this in three ways. The first (Curtiss et al., 2007) was to use Salmonella vaccine strains with mutations such as pmi or galE, or deletion-insertion mutations, such as \u0394Prfc::TT araC PBAD\nrfc (Kong et al., 2010) and \u0394PrfaH::TT araC PBAD\nrfaH (Kong et al., 2009). These strains would synthesize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen and/or outer core when supplied with a sugar (mannose, galactose, and/or arabinose) during growth and cease such synthesis in vivo where that sugar would be unavailable such that a rough phenotype would be manifested after some six to eight cell divisions in vivo (Curtiss et al., 2007). The second was to delete promoters for genes essential for virulence and pathogenicity and replace them with the araC PBAD regulatory cassette. So that expression of these genes would be dependent on the presence of arabinose during vaccine strain growth and would cease to be expressed in vivo due to the absence of arabinose (Curtiss et al., 2009). In these cases, the imposition of attenuation is gradual since the gene product is diluted by half at each cell division in vivo. The third strategy is regulated delayed lysis of the vaccine strain in vivo, a system designed for release of a bolus of protective antigen (Kong et al., 2008) or a DNA vaccine vector (Kong et al., 2012b), which provides total biological containment with no vaccine persistence in vivo and no survival if the vaccine strain is shed in feces.",

(2011a) have made a series of defined mutations to better define this problem. Based on the results of these studies, it is important to have wild-type levels of LPS present on vaccine cells at the time of immunizing an animal host. The presence of rpoS mutations in S. Typhimurium diminishes the strain\u2019s ability to colonize the GALT after oral immunization (Coynault et al., 1996, Nickerson and Curtiss, 1997) and thus decreases immunogenicity, a potential problem with derivatives of S.

We have observed this to be so using the regulated delayed attenuation associated with fur gene expression (Curtiss et al., 2009). Thus S. Typhimurium vaccine strains with the \u0394Pfur33::TT araC PBAD\nfur construction are more invasive and better colonizers of PP than strains with the \u0394Pfur81::TT araC PBAD\nfur construction that synthesizes less Fur when grown in medium with arabinose. It should be noted that this strategy might not be ideal if the vaccine strain is designed to overexpress Fur-regulated genes for iron acquisition proteins due to problems of iron toxicity. An additional means to increase invasiveness was reported by Kong et al. (2012b), who replaced the SPI-1 hilA promoter with Ptrc lacking the lacO sequence. Wild-type strains with this \u0394PhilA::Ptrc\u0394lacO\nhilA construction are more invasive, colonize all lymphoid tissues to higher levels, and have a lower LD50 than the wild-type parent. This enhanced virulence is not observed, however, in vaccine strains with other attenuating mutations, although the increased invasiveness and tissue-colonizing abilities are retained (Kong et al., 2012b).",

Such efforts were initiated in the late 1990s with production of IL-2 by an attenuated S. Typhimurium strain (Saltzman et al., 1997) as part of an antitumor therapy strategy. One very interesting application of this technology was the delivery of human IL-10 (as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease) by chromosomal insertion of the sequence encoding IL-10 to replace the thyA gene of L. lactis (Steidler et al., 2003). Another interesting application was the design of an attenuated S. Typhimurium synthesizing swine IL-18 and IFN-\u03b1 used as an adjuvant to enhance Th-1 biased protection against the pseudorabies virus to be coadministered with the PrV vaccine (Kim et al., 2012b). Other studies with RABVs delivering cytokines are listed in other sections of this chapter. Although some results reported are encouraging, more detailed and well-controlled studies will be needed to better delineate how expression of these cofactors would enhance immune responses and protection, especially in regard to mucosal immune responses and protection against pathogens infecting via a mucosal surface. I should note, however, that Yoon et al. (2011) discovered that engineering a commercial DNA vaccine vector to specify IL-12 synthesis to be delivered by wild-type S. Typhimurium UK-1 (low doses) resulted in attenuation of the Salmonella. Although Yoon et al. (2011) suggest this as a means to attenuate virulent pathogens and transform into vaccines, I would argue that this, like over-synthesis of a recombinant antigen, is not a safe, acceptable, or reliable means for RABV attenuation, since loss in ability to synthesize IL-12 would restore virulence.",

We still do not fully understand how to achieve safe, persistent production of antigens, or understand the means/mechanism by which the immunized host kills and lyses bacterial vaccine cells to release and process protective antigens. Although much work has focused on delivery of protective protein antigens, means to deliver protective carbohydrate antigens are mostly unstudied. Means to enhance production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that are highly immunogenic would be valuable.

Since gene expression levels vary greatly depending on site and direction of chromosomal insertion, one must empirically determine the optimal location. Proximity to the origin of chromosome replication might be better if higher levels of antigen synthesis are desired.

Thus, elimination or alteration of promoter and/or Shine-Dalgarno sequences on high copy number plasmids is often necessary. One way to enhance the level of antigen synthesis when inducing antibody responses is to use a runaway plasmid replication vector that is maintained at low copy number during growth of the strain. Then in vivo, a release from repression leads to plasmid amplification and high levels of protective antigen synthesis (Torres-Escobar et al., 2010a). It should be noted that this system also provides complete biological containment since the runaway plasmid replication seems to not be reversible, so that no viable vaccine cells can be recovered after mucosal immunization.",

The next system described was use of the T3SS (R\u00fcssmann, 1998) to both secrete antigens out of the cell but, more importantly, to translocate them into the cytosol of host cells where they are processed in the proteasome for class I presentation to augment induction of CD8-dependent CTL responses. Most of the initial work used the SPI-1 T3SS effectors to fuse to antigens with T cell epitopes (see Curtiss, 2005). More recently, Husseiny et al. (2007) have expanded such antigen delivery by characterizing use of the SPI-2 T3SS and associated effectors for antigen delivery. In this regard, the effector SseF seemed to work the best. Xu et al. (2010) also evaluated a number of SPI-2 in vivo-activated promoters for T3SS delivery of the model antigen OVA. As will be noted in later sections, many of the mucosally administered RABVs stimulate not only antibody production at mucosal sites but also cellular immunities.

(2002b) investigate use of the \u03b2-lactamase signal sequence to deliver the Streptococcus pneumoniae PspA protective antigen out of the cytosol into the periplasm. In this study, antibody titers to the PspA antigen were as high as the antibody titers to the Salmonella LPS and outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and it was found that some 15\u201320% of the PspA antigen was in the supernatant fluid. In a comparative study, the use of this \u03b2-lactamase T2SS yielded antibody titers to PspA that were about 100 times the titers when PspA was retained in the interior of the RASV strain (Kang and Curtiss, 2003). Since C-terminal sequences in \u03b2-lactamase also enhance its secretion (Koshland and Botstein, 1980), Branger et al. (2007) found that inclusion of both the N-terminal and C-terminal signal sequences of \u03b2-lactamase led to better secretion and higher antibody titers to the Y. pestis LcrV antigen. Xin et al. (2008) have investigated use of several other T2SS signal peptides, but the consensus to date is that the \u03b2-lactamase fusions are most efficient in the export of protective antigens.",

In either case, cell wall-less death occurs with release of any protective antigens present in RABV cells at the time of their lysis. Grangette et al. (2004) generated alanine racemase-deficient L. lactis and L. plantarum strains and found that both were superior in inducing tetanus antitoxin C antibodies but with the L. plantarum strain being superior, especially in inducing antitoxin IgA responses in intestinal secretions. Thus, lysis to release synthesized antigen is a superior means of antigen delivery, especially to induce mucosal immunity. Zhao et al. (2006) and Jiang et al. (2007) used a d-alanine requiring\nListeria monocytogenes strain to deliver the HIV-1-Gag antigen, and observed with one strain induction in mice of protective mucosal antibody and cellular responses as measured by challenge with a Gag-encoding recombinant vaccinia virus vector. Significantly, induction of high numbers of Gag-specific CD8+ T cells was observed in MALTs following oral vaccination.",

The chromosomal murA gene expression was also under araC PBAD regulation. The strain possessed a mutation to block synthesis of colanic acid that is able to protect cells undergoing cell wall-less death and a relA mutation to also ensure complete lysis by uncoupling cell growth from a dependence on protein synthesis. This system has been used to obtain better immune responses to protective antigens than achieved with nonlysis RASV strains (Ameiss et al., 2010, Ashraf et al., 2011, Juarez-Rodriguez et al., 2012a, Juarez-Rodriguez et al., 2012b). Juarez-Rodriguez et al. (2012b) encoded two different protective antigens (a fusion of two antigens), with one delivered by the T2SS and the other by the T3SS on a regulated delayed lysis plasmid such that the antigens would be secreted by either of two means continuously prior to cell lysis when a bolus of synthesized antigens was released.",

In S. Typhimurium, these activities are encoded by the recF and recJ genes that can be deleted to enhance plasmid stability (Zhang et al., 2011). The genes and the enzymes they encode are not the same or even present in all Salmonella serotypes. A recA mutation can also be included, but this results in total attenuation of most pathogens and has the potential to reduce immunogenicity. In contrast, recF and recJ mutations do not alter virulence or colonizing ability of S. Typhimurium (Zhang et al., 2011).",

While there has been much progress and development of new systems, it does not appear that many vaccines have reached the market place. There has also been a rapid expansion in the number of journals publishing findings in this field of mucosally administered vaccines. In reviewing this recent literature, I found many deficiencies and would not have recommended the publication of many papers without addition of specific information and probable conduct of additional experiments, including controls. I add this as a cautionary word to note that reference and citation of published work does not serve as an endorsement of its accuracy. Although many of the new systems described offer promising results, issues of safety and efficacy are not often addressed adequately. In regard to induction of mucosal immune responses, some of the more exciting observations pertain to the induction of cellular immune responses in mucosal tissues. This raises a major question that has yet to be addressed in any meaningful way. Namely, what is the duration in production of mucosal antibody responses following immunization, as well as for the duration of induced cellular immunity? More specifically, are memory responses induced, and what are the immunological bases for such memory? In these regards, the turnover and replacement of mucosal tissues is much more rapid than other internal tissues.",

(2011) evaluated many iron-regulated promoters in E. tarda, and found that Pdps and PyncE gave highest transcription of the sequence encoding the protective antigen glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from the fish pathogen Aeromonas hydrophlia. Plasmid vectors with antibiotic-resistance markers were introduced into various attenuated E. tarda strains and the recombinants used for bath vaccination of turbot (Scophtalmus maximus). Protective immunity to intramuscular (i.m.) challenge with both E. tarda and A. hydrophilia was observed. Mucosal immunity was not evaluated. Santander et al. (2010) and Choi and Kim (2011) developed balanced-lethal recombinant vector systems for antigen delivery in E. ictaluri and E. tarda, respectively, by deleting the asdA gene for aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase that imposes an obligate requirement for DAP. In both cases, this enables the development of recombinant vaccines that do not display undesirable resistance to antibiotics. Santander et al. (2010) also reported that both E. tarda and E. Ictaluri possess an inactive asdB gene that is present in an active form in most gram-positive bacteria and also in Vibrio species, which have both asdA and asdB. For attenuation, both crp (Santander et al., 2011) and fur (Santander et al., 2012) mutations render E. ictaluri attenuated and immunogenic for catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Wang et al.

However, in view of the significant mucosal cellular immune responses induced by both Listeria- and Mycobacterium-vectored vaccines, it is unfortunate that more effort has not been focused in studying induction of mucosal cellular immune responses by Salmonella-vectored vaccines. Digiandomenico et al. (2004) used an aroA S. Typhimurium strain to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses to a P. aeruginosa LPS O11 antigen after oral immunization, but did not observe significant protective immunity. A later study (Digiandomenico et al., 2007) using i.n. immunization of mice did, however, induce significant protective immunity. Thus, the route of immunization can impact the degree of success in conferring protective immunity. These results mandate the need to develop attenuation strategies that preclude Salmonella delivered by the i.n. route from traversing to the brain (Bollen et al., 2008). The alternative might be to investigate the use of sublingual immunization (Cuburu et al., 2007).",

In rare cases, the coding sequences have been modified to remove stem-loop structures in mRNA so as to reduce nuclease attack and increase mRNA half-life. In this regard, Becher et al. (2010) used a recombinant aroA S. Typhimurium strain, synthesizing the\nHelicobacter pylori UreA and B, to orally immunize mice to demonstrate induction of increased populations of CD4+ T cells and neutrophils in the gastric mucosa and a reduction in CD4+ Treg cells, which collectively led to reduced titers of H. pylori after the challenge. It is thus evident that RASVs are able to induce protective mucosal immune responses in the stomach compartment of the gastrointestinal tract. Induction of protective immune responses in the urinary tract was reported by Scavone et al. (2011), who used a TetC fusion to a P. mirabilis mannose-resistant fimbriae subunit (MrpA) to induce an immune response that significantly reduced titers of P. mirabilis in bladders and kidneys of i.n. immunized mice. As described in earlier sections and listed in Table 1, we have extensively modified RASV strains to enhance safety and immunogenicity to deliver multiple protective pneumococcal antigens to mice (see Curtiss et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2012a). Our objective has been to develop a vaccine to be orally administered to newborns that would protect against any and all S. pneumoniae serotypes that might be encountered anywhere in the world. Many of these improved strategies have also been used to improve the abilities of RASVs to induce protective immunity to both pneumonic and bubonic plague (Table 1). While RASVs have been extensively used to develop vaccines for diarrheal diseases, they also have been effective against cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, at least in rodents (see Table 1).",

There is also the issue of tolerance to the bacterial antigen delivery vector, a potential problem as discussed above, when using commensal bacterial strains as antigen-delivery vectors. Metzger et al. (2004) evaluated this question using human volunteers and S. Typhi Ty21a with and without delivery of plasmid-encoded H. pylori UreA and B subunits. In these studies, prior immunization and existing antibodies to Salmonella LPS did not alter the frequency (56%) of individuals showing cellular immune responses to the UreA and B subunits. Attridge and Vindurampulle (2005) also reviewed this issue and therefore examined whether mice primed by oral immunization with S. Stanley, a serotype naturally attenuated for mice that transiently colonizes PP but not the liver and spleen, would lessen immune responses to the K88 pilus antigen when delivered later by a recombinant S. Stanley strain. In all cases, even with priming by i.n. and i.p. routes, immune responses to K88 based on antibody production were muted after immunization of the primed mice with the recombinant vaccine.",

In evaluating such strains of S. Typhimurium (Shi et al., 2010a) and S.

These bacteria that grow optimally at lower than mammalian and avian body temperatures (L. lactis and L. casei) do not persist or establish as commensals in orally immunized animal hosts, whereas those species that grow at 37 \u00b0C (L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. helveticus) persist longer. An issue not addressed concerns the use of bacterial vaccine vectors that are selected from strains with the potential to be commensals and thus induce immunological tolerance. The high repetitive doses needed to induce desired immune responses would seem to favor this outcome.",

(2002) compared plasmid encoded synthesis and delivery of tetanus toxin fragment C by L. lactis that cannot persist and colonize the intestinal tract of mice and L. plantarum that can. The recombinant L. plantarum was best and the UV-irradiated construct also was inferior to the live viable strain. Mice were immunized intragastrically with 109\n CFU on three consecutive days with two or three repeat immunizations three weeks apart. Conclusions are based on induced serum IgG levels and neutralization of tetanus toxin. Reveneau et al. (2002) compared three L. plantarum strains that either retained tetanus toxin fragment C in the cytoplasm, secreted it, or displayed it as cell-surface exposed. The three recombinant vaccine strains were then administered to mice by intragastric, i.n., and s.c. routes. All routes induced significant antitoxin antibodies with the strain with cell surface localizing fragment C requiring the lowest dose to induce antibodies but with the highest antibody titers observed for the strain having cytoplasmic localization of the antigen. Grangette et al. (2004) generated alanine racemase deficient L. lactis and L. plantarum strains and found that both were superior in inducing antitoxin C antibodies but with the L. plantarum strain being superior, especially in inducing antitoxin IgA responses in intestinal secretions. Thus, lysis to release synthesized antigen is a superior means of antigen delivery, especially to induce mucosal immunity.",

The cells were washed several times with distilled water, dried to a powder, and stored at 4 \u00b0C. The dried powders were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and administered in 200 \u03bcl by an intragastric tube to mice that had been fasted for 3 h. Mice were immunized 5 days a week during weeks one, two, four and eight. This vaccination induced significant proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ integrin \u03b14\u03b27\n+ cells in the intestinal mucosal lymphocytes and these cells exhibited CTL activities. Taguchi et al. (2012) extended these studies to demonstrate that coadministration of two different Japanese herbal medicines with the recombinant heat-inactivated L. casei strain enhanced the mucosal cellular immune responses to E7. Yoon et al. (2012) chose to deliver the HPV-16 L2 amino acids 1 to 224, which induces cross-reactive antibodies that would be prophylactic to other HPV types. The poly-\u03b3-glutamate synthetase A protein of B. subtilis was used to achieve surface display of the L2 sequence on L. casei that was repetitively used to immunize mice by intragastric lavage. Serum IgG and vaginal IgG and IgA were induced, and using bovine pseudovirions, they demonstrated neutralizing activity against the HPV pseudovirions of the types-18, -45, and -58. Sera from bovine papilloma virus (BPV)-16 L1 immunized mice showed no such neutralizing activity. Cortes-Perez et al.

            "text": "\nOliveira et al. (2006) initially introduced S. pneumoniae PsaA encoding sequences into L. lactis, L. casei, L. plantarum, and L. helveticus, but replaced its signal sequence and lipidation site during fusion to the usp45 SS. The recombinant L. lactis was least able to colonize after i.n. vaccination and elicited the lowest levels of anti-PsaA antibodies, compared to the other strains. The Lactobacillus species were thus superior in colonization and induction of immune responses with the L. plantarum and L. helveticus strains capable of growing at 37 \u00b0C, giving the best antibody results. These results are in accord with the findings of Grangette et al. (2004) discussed above and it is thus surprising that the Oliveira group in subsequent work, as well as other groups, continued to focus on use of L. casei strains. It should be noted that Wang et al. (2010b) found that only full-length PsaA with its signal sequence and lipidation signal was able to induce an immunity to block pneumococcal colonization in the upper respiratory tract of mice, whereas delivery of all truncated forms of PsaA were unable to induce such protection. Campos et al. (2008) (in the Oliveira group) thus expressed constitutively an S. pneumoniae D39 sequence encoding the \u03b1-helical domain and proline-rich region of the pspA gene lacking a signal sequence from a plasmid vector in L. casei and administered to mice in two i.n. doses of 109\n CFU. Serum IgG responses were induced and antibodies were able to coat the surface of a number of PspA Clade 1 and 2 strains. A modest level of protective immunity to a low-dose i.p. challenge with S. pneumoniae was observed. The recombinant L. casei persisted in the nasal mucosa for up to 6 days, but induction of mucosal immune responses was not monitored. This work has been expanded to also deliver the \u03b1-helical domain of the pspC gene (Ferreira et al., 2009), but i.n. immunization with six doses of 109\n CFU of the L. casei strain delivering PspC did not result in protective immunity. Hernani Mde et al. (2011) extended this work to demonstrate that i.n. immunization with the recombinant L. casei strain delivering PspC did reduce intranasal colonization by S. pneumoniae, and that challenge resulted in a detectable intranasal IgA response. As described above, Xin et al., 2008, Xin et al., 2009, Xin et al., 2012 observed significant protective immunity to several S. pneumoniae strains with different challenge routes with T2SS delivery by attenuated Salmonella vaccines of PspA and PspC alone, together, and as fusions to represent the diversity of epitopes in the \u03b1-helical domains and proline-rich regions of diverse pneumococcal serotypes.",

They used the nisin-inducible expression-secretion vector pNIES. Liu et al. (2009) used a plasmid vector encoding the poly-\u03b3-glutamate synthetase A protein of B. subtilis (Lee et al., 2006, Hou et al., 2007) to enable cell surface display of the ETEC F41 fimbrial antigen on L. casei cells. Repetitive oral immunization led to high titers of mucosal IgA and serum IgG with a Th2 skewing. Vaccinated mice challenged with a lethal dose of the F41+ ETEC strain cleared the infection from the intestinal tract and survived. Wei et al. (2010) also used the poly-\u03b3-glutamate synthetase A anchoring system to display K99 pilin on the surface of L. casei cells. Oral and i.n. immunization of mice induced mucosal IgA and serum IgG anti-K99 antibodies, and mice immunized by either route displayed 80% protection to an oral challenge with the ETEC strain C83912. Further studies, including induction of protective immunity, with this surface display of pilin subunits and antigen delivery by L. casei for the K88 and K99 fimbrial antigens has been reported by Wen et al. (2012). Chu et al. (2005) constructed a fusion of the gene for K99 to the S-layer gene of L. acidophilus to be expressed from a plasmid vector under control of the constitutive S-layer protein promoter. The recombinant L. acidophilus, unlike L. casei and L. lactis, grows at 37 \u00b0C and was used to colonize pigs after oral administration. K99 antigen was found on the cell surface and in the supernatant and the recombinant adhered to the intestinal brush border and competitively displaced ETEC strains with K99 fimbriae.

This particular strain seemed to persist at higher titers in various intestinal compartments than strains used by others and induced good fecal IgA and serum IgG titers. Most importantly, both inhibited transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) plaque formation on monolayers of swine testicular cells. We had earlier delivered TGEV S protein from an attenuated S. Typhimurium vaccine (Smerdou et al., 1996a) to orally immunized mice to induce mucosal IgA and serum IgG responses that were not virus-neutralizing (unpublished). An improved strategy was employed to fuse a DNA sequence encoding multimers of a 25 amino acid protective S-gene epitope to the C-terminal end of LT-B with its signal sequence intact (Smerdou et al., 1996b). This vaccine strain used to orally immunize rabbits did induce both intestinal IgA and serum IgG at titers sufficient to neutralize TGEV. Although the inability of bacteria to glycosylate viral proteins has often precluded inducing protective immune responses, the results of Ho et al.

It is often not recognized that expression of genes cloned on high copy number vectors do not need a promoter (Kang et al., 2002b); thus, one can get expression of the sequence to be expressed under control of the CMV promoter in the immunized animal host in the bacterial strain prior to or during immunization. To further complicate matters, bacterial RNA polymerase can transcribe sequences thousands of bp from a promoter, such as the one associated with the selective marker. Thus, unless one has strong transcription terminators on either side of the eukaryotic expression cassette or bacterial synthesized antisense mRNA to preclude expression of the CMV promoter-associated coding sequence (Kong et al., 2012b), one is likely to have presynthesized protective antigens present in the RABV before immunization. When delivery of a DNA vaccine is desirable so that the encoded product can be glycosylated in the cells of the immunized host, we often will have a mixture of antigen with some synthesized in the bacterial vaccine cell being nonglycosylated. This can result in a mixed immune response rather than one of high specificity. These problems can be addressed by careful design of the DNA vaccine vector with careful use of transcription terminators, stop codons, and by direction of transcription of various coding sequences.",

            "text": "Using an attenuated bacterial vector to deliver a DNA vaccine has a potential benefit when the vector strain is administered at a mucosal portal of entry. This is because there is a likely induction of mucosal antibody and cellular immune responses. Unfortunately, such mucosal responses have not been rigorously quantified and shown to only be due to delivery of the DNA vaccine and not to delivery of preformed antigens as discussed above. Deciding to use a DNA vaccine delivery system is very much dependent on the pathogen type that the vaccine is designed to protect against. Since most bacteria do not glycosylate their gene products (there are exceptions), the delivery of bacterial genes encoding protective antigens is not a wise choice, unless it is shown that the gene product synthesized in bacteria and in suitable eukaryotic cells are the same with no posttranslational modifications in the eukaryotic cell that would lead to induction of a nonprotective immune response. Elsewhere in this book, Raska and Turanek discuss the induction of mucosal immunity by DNA vaccines administered as naked DNA plasmids.",

It will thus be best to release the DNA vaccine by lysis of the RABV, preferably in the host cell cytosol, and to eliminate bacterial nucleases by inclusion of appropriate mutations. Since many bacteria induce apoptosis/pyroptosis in eukaryotic cells in which they invade, and since these events would decrease the ability of the nucleus to transcribe the DNA vaccine encode sequences, one must lessen the ability of the vaccine vector to induce apoptosis/pyroptosis. One can also alter the display of PAMPs to recruit desired innate immune responses. In this regard, Li et al. (2007a) described constructing a DNA vaccine vector encoding short 40 bp and long 750 bp hairpin RNA molecules to exert adjuvant effects. The short-stem molecule did not enhance apoptosis or reporter gene expression but did enhance induction of antigen-specific cellular immune responses. On the other hand, the long-stem RNA increased apoptosis but did not enhance cellular immunity. The question arises as to where in the cell does dsRNA act to enhance recruitment of innate immunity to result in the desired cellular immunities? Another potentially useful attribute has been described by Carvalho et al. (2010), in which DNA vaccine vectors specify fusions to target encoded antigens to extracellular spaces, lysosomes, and/or the endoplasmic reticulum.",

In addition to the need to use bacterial vectors that either do not induce or induce diminished or delayed apoptosis/pyroptosis in the cells in which the DNA vaccine is delivered (as discussed above), there is a need to deliver the DNA vaccines to tissues with cells able to synthesize the protective antigen and to modify it correctly by posttranslational modification. Raska et al. (2008) have demonstrated that delivery of a DNA vaccine encoding the HIV gp120 antigen induced maximal humoral immune responses when the DNA vaccine was delivered i.v. in a manner to enhance delivery to the liver. They also noted the superior ability of the liver to carry out appropriate glycosylation of the gp120 antigen, which also contributed to induction of neutralizing antibodies. In this regard, DNA vaccines delivered by invasive bacterial strains, such as Salmonella and Listeria, that effectively colonize the liver and spleen most likely will be better for DNA vaccine delivery than noninvasive bacterial strains. Such comparisons need to be made as do studies to relate the amount of antigen synthesized to relative induction of humoral immune responses versus CD4- and CD8-dependent cellular immunities (Table 2\n).",

The genetic attributes involving biofilm formation needed for such persistence have been investigated and reviewed (see Gonzalez-Escobedo et al., 2011). We included mutations to block synthesis of thin aggregative fimbriae, colanic acid, and LPS O-antigen in vivo in RASV S. Typhi strains delivering pneumococcal PspA antigen as a means to block such persistence (Shi et al., 2010b). Baumler and colleagues (Kingsley et al., 2000, Kingsley et al., 2003, Weening et al., 2005) have investigated the roles of fimbrial adhesins for persistence in the intestinal tract, as well as the importance of S. Typhimurium surface antigens that bind to extracellular matrix proteins that also facilitate intestinal persistence. Most of the mutations contributing these features do not significantly attenuate strains, but further studies are needed since strains with these attributes are often difficult to recover from immunized animals and are not shed in feces in human volunteers.\n",

These mutations will be particularly useful in strains with regulated delayed lysis in vivo (Kong et al., 2008, Kong et al., 2012b), as well as in strains undergoing lysis by other means as discussed above, since in all cases endotoxin will be released during lysis and could result in a cytokine storm or sepsis.",

Furthermore, a thyA mutant of L. lactis was stably maintained in pigs. This was shown by Steidler et al.

This is interesting, since thyA mutants of S. Typhimurium are not attenuated (Curtiss and Kelly, 1987). Of course, L. lactis does not need additional attenuation.

Many researchers started using site-directed mutagenesis for codon optimization and improved promoter design over 15 years ago, and many of us have not cloned a gene for over 5 years, preferring instead to have it synthesized. Reverse vaccinology (Rappuoli, 2001) and bioinformatics analyses in general have been used for over 15 years to identify surface exposed antigens, signal secretion sequences, and protein fusion partners for antigen export and targeting. One of the perplexing discoveries in the last several years is the finding that cytoplasmic proteins, with no means yet discovered for their export from bacterial cells, can induce protective immunity. Such protective or partially protective antigens have been identified in Mycobacterium, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, possibly implying something unique in gram-positive bacterial pathogens. One possibility is release of such antigens by formation of membrane vesicles (Prados-Rosales et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2011, Thay et al., 2013) released in vivo to stimulate immune responses to these cytoplasmic proteins that must be important for virulence. I think it is interesting that engineers and computer scientists are now interested in genetic engineering, but have been obliged to rename the discipline as synthetic biology, possibly to avoid the need to master the essential knowledge of biology and genetics. We genetic engineers, however, while often progressing by applying new approaches relying on bioinformatics and computer science, have been slow to incorporate these new approaches from the engineering sciences. The problem, of course, is that many of us prefer the cerebral approach to science that requires bench work to achieve understanding, rather than to embrace mindless and costly high-throughput screening in hopes of effortless discovery of something important.",

Since the ultimate objective is to deliver vaccine constructs that will be safe and efficacious in protecting animals and humans against infectious disease agents, it follows that one has to contemplate conduct of relevant preclinical studies to validate vaccine performance to secure approval or funding to advance the effort and commence clinical trials. One also has to consider means for manufacture and preservation. Lastly, regulatory issues associated with using live vaccines that are genetically modified are of considerable importance.",
