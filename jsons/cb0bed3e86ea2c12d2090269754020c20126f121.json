            "text": "The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic requires timely and finessed actions. Policy makers around the globe are hard pressed to balance mitigation measures such as social distancing and economic interests. While initial studies [3] predicted millions of potential deaths never findings hint at a much more modest outcome [8, 4] . Especially the case fatality rate (CFR) and the number of unobserved infections are crucial to judge the state of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of its mitigation. Yet, there estimates are plagued with high uncertainties as exemplified in the quick revisions even from the same institution [3, 4] Most studies are based on elaborate epidemic modeling either using stochastic or deterministic transmission dynamics. Especially, the susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) model [10] forms a basic building block and has been extended in several directions in order to understand the dynamics of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic [9, 2, 7, 13] . In this context, it has not only been compared with more phenomenological growth models [12] , e.g. logistic growth, but also been used to quantify the effectiveness of quarantine and social distancing [9, 2] . E.g. social distancing, can be easily included by replacing the infection rate parameter with a function allowing it to change over time. [2] assumes one or several (soft) step functions where the infection rate drops in response to different measures after these had been implemented.",

Yet, substantial care is needed as to which parameters can be learned from the data and which cannot. Indeed, I show here that SIR type models -and others exhibiting similarly flexible growth dynamics -are non-identified with respect to the CFR and the fraction of observed infections. Instead, a direct visual exploration of the data leads to valuable insights in this regard. In particular, much of the variability relating reported case and death counts can be explained by two easily interpreted parameters. Furthermore, based on three simple assumptions a lower bound on the number of actual infections, including observed and unobserved cases, can be obtained. In turn, confirming recent estimates without the need of complex and maybe questionable modeling choices.",

Note that in each case, there exists a characteristic delay such that estimates are almost constant over time. Further note that estimates for all delays will eventually converge to the same final value when enough data are available. Figure 2 suggests that relative case counts are not aligned as some countries, e.g. Germany, systematically lead the counts reported in other countries, e.g. Italy. Such a difference could mean that individuals survive longer, e.g. due to differences in medical care, until they eventually. It could also just reflect reporting delays due to bureaucratic reasons.

To illustrate this effect, a true CFR of 1% is assumed in the following. This is consistent with current knowledge and had also been used in other studies [4] . Just from the estimated values any CFR below the minimum of all estimates (about 2% found for Austria and South Korea) and above 0.1% (which would imply an observed fraction above one for Belgium) is compatible with the data.

Thus, detailed epidemic modeling is certainly needed in order to judge the effectiveness of current mitigation measures across different countries [4, 2] . On the other hand, important parameters need to fixed based on additional knowledge as they cannot be identified within sufficiently flexible models.

For simplicity, consider the above model with \u03b2 I = \u03b2 O = \u03b2 U =: \u03b2. Then, new infections arise with intensity \u03b2 St N (I t + O t + U t ) which in turn translate into observed cases with intensity Total cumulative observed infections and number of susceptible individuals in two simulated model with observation fractions \u03b1 = 0.1 (true), \u03b1 = 1 and time shift \u03c4 = 5 (approx).
