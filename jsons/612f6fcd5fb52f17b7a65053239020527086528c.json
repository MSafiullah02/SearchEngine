Invasion of the lower respiratory tract usually occurs when normal defense mechanisms are impaired, such as associated with a viral infection, chronic malnutrition, chronic aspiration, impaired cough reflex (e.g., after sedation, neurologic damage, intubation) or after exposure to environmental pollutants. Bacterial pneumonia can occasionally occur by the hematogenous route. In the early stages of lobar or bacterial pneumonia, protein-rich edema fluid containing numerous organisms fill the alveoli, leading to marked capillary congestion and causing neutrophil exudation and intra-alveolar hemorrhage. There is decrease in lung compliance, increase in pulmonary resistance, small airway obstruction, air trapping, and change in ventilationperfusion ratio, all leading to the clinical signs of respiratory distress. Defense mechanisms against LRI consist of (1) anatomic and physiologic barriers; (2) humoral and cell-mediated protection; and (3) phagocytic activity. The presence of hairs in the anterior nares (that trap particles >10 \u00b5m in size), configuration of the nasal turbinates, and acute branching of airways form protective anatomic barriers. Filtration and humidification capacities of the upper airways, mucus production, and middle airway protection by the epiglottis and cough reflex (eliminating particles 2-10 \u00b5m) form physiologic barriers. The mucociliary blanket transports microscopic amounts of normally aspirated oropharyngeal flora and particulate matter up the tracheobronchial tree, minimizing the presence of bacteria below the carina. Particles <1 \u00b5m can escape into the lower airways. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody is secreted into the upper airways, and IgG and IgM leach from the local capillaries into the lower airways. Alveolar fluid surfactant, fibronectin, complement, lysozyme, and iron-binding proteins also have antimicrobial activity. The lower respiratory tract has three distinct populations of macrophages: alveolar, interstitial, and intravascular macrophages. Alveolar macrophages are the preeminent phagocytic cells that ingest and kill bacteria. In addition to phagocytic function, interstitial macrophages are antigenprocessing cells, whereas the intravascular macrophages clear inflammatory debris through the bloodstream. Viral infection (especially due to influenza virus), high oxygen concentration, uremia, and use of alcohol or drugs can impair function of alveolar macrophages, predisposing to pneumonia.

Fever and rapid breathing can precede onset of cough in some children. Older children can complain of pleuritic chest pain or nuchal rigidity (each referable to lobe involvement). Signs of respiratory distress include tachypnea, hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <92%), apnea, increased work of breathing (subcostal, intercostal or suprasternal retractions; nasal flaring; or grunting) or altered mental status. 41 Guidelines developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia in developing countries highlight tachypnea and retractions as the two best indicators of LRI. 42 Tachypnea is defined as >50 breaths/min in infants <12 months, >40 for those 1 to 5 years, and >30 for children >5 years of age. Among children <5 years of age, tachypnea (as defined by WHO) had the highest sensitivity (74%) and specificity (67%) for radiologically confirmed pneumonia, but was less sensitive and specific in early disease. 38, 43 Tachypnea can occur with other conditions, such as fever, asthma, cardiac disease, and metabolic acidosis. The predictive values of clinical findings for pneumonia have been studied repeatedly. [44] [45] [46] [47] In one study, the combination of a respiratory rate >50 breaths/min, oxygen saturation <96%, and the presence of nasal flaring in children <12 months of age was highly associated with radiographically confirmed pneumonia. 40 Oxygen saturation is frequently decreased with moderate to severe pneumonia and is an indication for hospital admission. 41,48 A hypoxemic infant or child may not appear cyanotic. 49 Although hypoxemia, use of accessory muscles of respiration, head bobbing, nasal flaring, and grunting are predictive of pneumonia, their absence does not exclude pneumonia. 46, 50 Decreased and bronchial breath sounds, egophony (\"E\" to \"A\" change), bronchophony, tactile fremitus, and dullness to percussion are specific signs of lung consolidation. Crackles can be absent in a dehydrated patient. 51 Isolated wheezing or prolonged expiration is associated with bronchiolitis and is uncommon in bacterial pneumonia. 44 Almost three fourths of children with radiographically confirmed pneumonia appear ill.

When this balance is disturbed, fluid accumulates. Transudate occurs when there are changes in the hydrostatic forces with normal capillary permeability, whereas exudate results when there is increased capillary permeability and lymphatic obstruction. 152, 153 Pleural mesothelial macrophages contribute to the innate local defense against infection. 154 Pathogens can gain entry into the pleural space by direct extension from the alveoli, by hematogenous spread from the skin surface through a penetrating injury, from rupture of the esophagus, or from an intra-abdominal site through the diaphragm. 155 Direct extension from the alveoli is by far the most common. Certain pathogens such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes demonstrate tropism for the pleural surface for reasons that are not well understood but that likely include virulent factors such as exotoxins, endotoxins, or attachment molecules. Exposure of the pleural mesothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide, thrombin, or bacteria can incite an innate and adaptive inflammatory response causing pleural mesothelial macrophage dysfunction. 156, 157 Vascular endothelial growth factor is released, which potentiates endothelial injury, increased capillary permeability, and extravasation of pulmonary interstitial fluid into the pleural space. 158 Mesothelial cells recruit neutrophils and monocytes and secrete large amounts of chemokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), into the pleural fluid that, when inhibited by bacterial proteins, results in an acidic, purulent fluid (i.e., empyema). 159 Acidic environment of the pleural fluid both suppresses bacterial growth and interferes with antibiotic activity. With disease progression, more inflammatory cytokines are released, and there is activation of coagulation leading to deposition of fibrin. Three stages in the natural course of empyema are recognized. First, in the exudative phase, the fluid has low cellular content, normal glucose, and normal pH. Second, in the fibrinopurulent phase, frank pus containing neutrophils and fibrin is formed, and glucose and pH of fluid are low.

The etiology and course in children differ compared with adults. Lung abscess usually occurs as a consequence of a localized lung infection by particularly virulent, pyogenic bacteria. Necrotizing pneumonia in an otherwise healthy child usually resolves with antimicrobial treatment, but occasionally can progress to formation of pneumatoceles (blebs in the lung parenchyma created by coalescence of alveolar spaces after rupture function. 174 These can be achieved by either medical or surgical interventions depending on the age of the patient, size of the effusion, severity of respiratory distress, loculation, and failure of initial medical therapy. Supportive care using appropriate antipyretics, analgesics, oxygen supplementation, and fluid therapy must be instituted early and patients must be monitored closely to recognize respiratory deterioration, central respiratory depression from excessive analgesics, or fluid overload related to SIADH. Chest physiotherapy is avoided because this causes discomfort and can further compromise the respiratory effort. 149 Antimicrobial Therapy. In choosing therapy, consideration is given to probable pathogens (predicted by age), pathogen and geographic resistance patterns, clinical circumstances (community or healthcare onset), host factors (immunocompetent or compromised), radiographic findings, and Gram stain and culture of the pleural fluid. Children with small, uncomplicated effusion can be managed as outpatients with an empiric antibiotic regimen as for CAP. In most hospitalized patients, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime given intravenously is recommended as empiric therapy to adequately treat S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Vancomycin is added if the patient is very ill appearing or CA-MRSA or hospital-acquired MRSA is considered a potential pathogen. In areas where CA-MRSA is highly clindamycin susceptible, clindamycin could be an adequate addition. Vancomycin has poor pharmacokinetics for infections in the lung. Other agents with good MRSA activity include linezolid, telavancin, ceftaroline, and quinupristin-dalfopristin; these agents are considered second-line treatment for patients who do not respond to vancomycin therapy. Daptomycin should not be used because it is inactivated by surfactant. In patients with suspected pneumonia aspiration, clindamycin can be used instead of vancomycin to cover anaerobic bacteria. In cases in which atypical pathogens are suspected, a macrolide (for children <7 years) or doxycycline (for children >7 years) may be added. When a specific pathogen is detected, or when the clinical course and microbiologic screening cultures make Staphylococcal infection highly unlikely, the antibiotic spectrum should be narrowed. Duration of parenteral therapy and total treatment is individualized on the basis of clinical response and adequacy of drainage. It is common practice to replace parenteral therapy with oral therapy when substantial improvement occurs and the patient has good oral intake, with continuation of antibiotics for a total course of 2 to 4 weeks for empyema. 41 The treatment may be prolonged when drainage is delayed and systemic manifestations are protracted. In circumstances in which the effusion persists and the microbial etiology is unknown, it is important to remember that even with optimal antibiotic therapy, fever, anorexia, and toxicity can be due to a prolonged inflammatory response.

It is important not to drain fluid too rapidly because reexpansion pulmonary edema can occur, causing increased morbidity and even mortality. 175 The course is observed over 48 to 72 hours. Many patients improve. If the patient does not improve or worsens, ultrasonography is performed to determine the extent of reaccumulation. If fluid has reaccumulated, continuous drainage is required; if not, an antibiotic regimen is reconsidered. For patients with a large effusion or patients with respiratory compromise, a chest tube is placed as soon as possible for continuous drainage. A small bore chest tube is preferable for patient comfort and was associated with shorter hospital stay and found to be superior to surgical stiff drains in two studies. 176, 177 Chest radiography is repeated to verify chest tube placement and to exclude the development of pneumothorax during placement.
