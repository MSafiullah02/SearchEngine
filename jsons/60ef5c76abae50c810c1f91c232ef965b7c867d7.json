The database consisted of 6480 ATP measurements from four critical surfaces (student desktops, cafeteria tabletops, and restroom sinks and stall doors). Data was assessed according to ranges of ATP values before and after cleaning. Results showed the potential for such data to provide the basis for a standardized approach to the measurement of cleaning effectiveness, based on detection and quantification of pollutant loads of biological origin, across critical surfaces in school building environments. It is anticipated that verification of this data in school buildings across different geographic and climatic regions will lead to the establishment of \"acceptable\" ranges of ATP values that can be used as a practice-based approach to improving cleaning practices and contributing to healthier school environments.",

According to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report, (1) schools in unsatisfactory condition can be found in every part of the country. More than 14 million children are being taught in school buildings needing significant repairs to restore them to good overall condition. To compound this problem, the definition of a \"clean\" environment in educational facilities is lacking at present. Meeting the challenge in setting practitioner-based cleaning protocols today must be based on the relationship between our understanding of the term \"clean\" and its relationship to the health of occupants. Today, the professional cleaning industry has moved toward the approach of \"cleaning for health first and appearance second,\" based on three decades of investigation and research that has characterized the building ecosystem, in addition to the assessment of occupant exposures and potential health risks.",

Rarely are quantitative measurements of the surfaces and materials that are cleaned and sanitized required in support of the visual assessment. This is unfortunate, as cleaning practices and procedures may be adequate according to an eyeball assessment but inadequate for the efficient removal of unwanted and less visible substances such as biological residue pollutants.

(3) Increased efforts at improved cleaning of floors and desks in schools have been shown to reduce upper respiratory symptoms. (4) The reduction of airborne pollutants through effective cleaning practices and, hence, reduced occupant exposures and health risks has been demonstrated in a long-term cleaning effectiveness study. (5) More recent studies collectively indicate that enhanced hygiene in schools and targeted cleaning of biological residual contamination related to frequent contact points result in reduced illnesses tied into bacterial contamination reservoirs (MRSA, Shigella outbreaks), reduced sick building syndrome symptoms, and reduced absenteeism due to infectious illness. (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has historically been used successfully as an important marker for the detection and quantification of pollutant loads of biological origin and overall cleanliness in the food production and food service industries, and it has been recently confirmed as a representative marker for detection of levels of surface contamination in hospital settings. (11, 12) Previous research has also identified the use of ATP marker as a feasible, rapid, real-time, quantitative, and economical approach to the measurement of cleaning effectiveness on a variety of surfaces and materials in school buildings. (13) ATP is the energy driver for biological systems and can be measured through an enzymatic luciferin/luciferase reaction detected and quantified as bioluminescence. The method converts ATP into a light signal that is measured by an instrument that provides a quantitative measurement of ATP from biomass in relative light units (RLUs). Thus, after cleaning and a drop in biomass, there is a corresponding decrease in measureable ATP.",

Based on those values, as well as values expressed as log-transformed data, there was consistency between ATP1 and ATP2 test systems where RLU values were highest for classroom desks and cafeteria tables, followed by sink surfaces and then toilet stall doors. The ATP3 test system data results were less consistent and did not follow the ATP1 and ATP2 results as to ranking of most-to-least contaminated of the four surfaces examined. The reason for this inconsistency should be further examined for more reliable assessment of surfacespecific cleanliness. The distribution of RLU values shown for ATP1 and ATP2 represents 4320 measurements (2160 pre-cleaning, 2160 postcleaning) and provides for the first time a view of the extent of biologically associated surface contamination across multiple school buildings, as well as its statistically derived distribution. Those values were derived on the basis of an acceptably rigorous cleaning protocol, in conjunction with a standardized method of ATP testing.",

The data display the microbial reduction as compared with the ATP values. Table VII shows correlation coefficients between log-transformed ATP and RODAC values. There are statistically significant, moderate correlations between pre-cleaning ATP and bacterial counts (Pearson correlations 0.22-0.29). However, post-cleaning correlations between ATP and RODAC were weaker and not statistically significant (Pearson correlations 0.03-0.19), and in general, higher correlations were observed between different ATP systems (pre-cleaning 0.31-0.45, postcleaning 0.19-0.34). The reason for relatively weak/moderate correlations between different systems could be partly related to the systems themselves, but also, it appears there can be considerable differences in ATP levels across surfaces. Thus, a sample taken adjacent to another sample could have a vastly different reading. It is therefore prudent that assessment of cleaning effectiveness is based on large enough sample size (i.e., in this study 10 samples per surface type per school).",

Rather, it was to exhibit the usefulness of ATP as a problem-solving, relatively simple, rapid, and affordable marker for the routine detection of residual contamination of biological origin on surfaces. ATP is an excellent candidate marker for the monitoring of biologically derived surface soiling/cleanliness, since most surfaces collect and retain soils, dusts, and various deposits containing a myriad of particles and fragments of biological origin, including those from plants (such as pollens, fibers, dusts, and so on) and animals (skin cells, dander, insect parts, secretions, exudates, and so on), as well as microorganisms that are environmentally ubiquitous. ATP monitoring, however, is not appropriate for the determination of the presence or reduction of specific nonbiological pollutants that are recognized and regulated human health hazards such as lead, asbestos, and chemical residues, among others. Based on the extensive measurements taken on critical surface areas of the participant schools, the data generated in this study allow for the initial establishment of typical ranges of ATP values that can be expected in school environments. It is anticipated that such ranges can be established for each surface type, and that those may be used in a standardized and routine approach to the monitoring of cleaning effectiveness in school buildings.",

Reasonable range values from this study have been established and may be factored into a standardized approach to the routine monitoring of cleaning effectiveness based on detection and quantification of pollutant loads of biological origin in school buildings. Data also revealed a reduction of culturable bacteria coincident with ATP reduction after cleaning. Specific ATP values/ranges appear to be a function of both surface material type and location within a school building, and further study in school buildings across the United States is expected to confirm unique values for such critical compartments of the school building ecosystem.",
