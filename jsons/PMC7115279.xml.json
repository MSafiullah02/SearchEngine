The details, including technologic information and protocol setting of this system, were introduced elsewhere.10, 15, 18 Currently, this system is widely adopted in public and private hospitals in Hong Kong and is used as a local quality control standard by respirator manufacturers. Figure 2\nshows the fit tester system, tubing connection, and respirator. All of the participants were only required to perform the static portion out of the 8 specified exercises (ie, normal breathing, deep breathing). In this portion, the participants should remain still in a normal standing position and breathe as usual for 60 seconds before taking long deep breaths as if working hard for another 60 seconds. The research nurses monitored and assessed chest movement by visual inspection to estimate adequacy of the depth (Fig 2). These 2 exercises gave particular individual fit factors (FFs; range, 0-200). Each FF is the ratio of a challenge agent (ambient particles) concentration outside the respirator to the concentration of a challenge agent that leaks into the inside of the respirator. A FF <100 under the normal breathing and deep breathing exercises is defined as actual gross leakage.10, 16 The higher the FF, the lesser amount of leakage. The PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester 8038 went through a daily check procedure to warrant the sufficiency of ambient particles and performance of the system.15\n",

The selection was based on 3 reasons. First, these 3 models are typically and widely used in local clinical settings. Second, previous studies demonstrated that the prevalence of the fit-testing failure rate was approximately 40% for the 3M models.11, 12, 14, 15, 16 It is estimated that the prevalence of actual gross leakage would be lower than that. According to our previous experience on QNFT, the obtained FFs of normal and deep breathing were generally higher than that of the other exercises. Extreme prevalence rates, such as <20% or >80%, greatly deteriorated the accuracy of both positive and negative predictive values.26, 27 The prevalence rate of actual gross leakage among the 3 different designs of respirators should be within the optimal range for calculation of the predictive values. Finally, it is unrealistic and unnecessary to include all types of N95 respirators for fit testing. In general, most of them were designed under these 3 categories. This study used a representative respirator from each category; hence, the results could provide a better evaluation on the validity of the user seal check.",

The current study hypothesizes that the user seal check may contribute to the detection of gross leakage in normal and deep breathing, which is important information during on-site donning.25, 26 However, based on the unacceptable sensitivity (21.5%-28.0%) and specificity (75.2%-81.7%) in the current results, the hypothesis that the user seal check is able to detect actual gross leakage in normal and deep breathing is also rejected. Interestingly, the sensitivity and specificity of the user seal check in determining the fit of N95 respirators and in detecting gross leakage are fairly comparable.

Although our aim was not to investigate the prevalence of gross leakage of all different models of N95 respirators, it was possible that different results might be obtained with different respirators. Nevertheless, we believe that the results supported the unacceptably low sensitivity and positive predictive value and futile likelihood ratios of the user seal check in identifying gross leakage of respirators. Apart from this, participants' characteristics might affect the passing rate of fit testing. First, most participants were novice users, except that some worked in clinical settings as health care workers. Previous experience and knowledge of donning an N95 respirator were insufficient, which may influence the passing rate of QNFT on gross leakage detection. This is different from a previous study, where Viscusi et al recruited subjects who were required to pass a standard QNFT. Therefore, the current results may underestimate the passing rate of QNFT.24 Second, Asian participants' weight (reported here) and facial anthropometries (eg, face length, face width; not reported here) were significantly different from that of non-Asian people, which hence affects the passing rate of QNFT. Such differences might reduce the generalizability of the results but increase the specificity of that to Asian populations. Concerning environmental factors, the average monthly humidity in Hong Kong (subtropical climate) ranged from 67%-86% in 201434; yearly humidity computed from 2000-2014 was 78.1%. Most hospitals are only equipped with central air conditioning systems, and indoor humidity of wards may vary from 65%-75%. Relatively high humidity might underestimate the positive result of the user seal check in the current study because participants rely on subjective comparison between inward and ambient air to detect the leakage. Unlike well-controlled internal hospital settings in other regions, these environmental differences may limit the current results in that they are less relevant to other settings but are highly situation-specific results for many hospitals located in subtropical climate regions.",
