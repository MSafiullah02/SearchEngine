We report that by reverse transcriptaseY polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA of LRRK2 is expressed in soluble extracts of human brain, liver, and heart and in cultured human astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendroglia as well as in human neuroblastoma cell lines. We find by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 protein (Lrrk2) specific for C-terminal residues 2511Y2527 that an apparent full-length protein and several of its fractions are expressed in soluble extracts of normal human brain. By immunocytochemistry, the antibody recognizes neurons, and more weakly astrocytes and microglia, in normal brain tissue. It intensely labels Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. It also labels a subset of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease and the Parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam (PDCG). It labels thornshaped astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in PDCG; oligodendroglial inclusions in multiple system atrophy; Pick bodies in Pick disease; nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in Huntington disease; and intraneuronal and glial inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In summary, LRRK2 is constitutively expressed in neurons and also in glial cells of human brain. It strongly associates with pathological inclusions in several neurodegenerative disorders.",

Although it is a large and complex protein, it has nevertheless been highly conserved through evolution, indicating important physiological functions. Homologs are found even as far back as prokaryotes. Lrrk2 belongs to the Roco protein family of the Ras/GTPase superfamily (8Y10). The sequential structure includes a leucine-rich repeat zone (Lrr), a Ras of complex proteins (Roc), a C-terminal of Roc (Cor) domain, and a microtubuleassociated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) domain, with termination in beta propeller forming repeats (WD 40). Lrrk2 is thought to function, at least in part, as an active protein kinase (11) with mutations resulting in a gain of function (12) .",

They occur in each of the functional domains. As examples, the mutations R1067Q, S1096C, I1122V, and S1228T occur in the LRR domain; whereas I1371V, R1441C, R1441G, and R1441H occur in the Roc domain; R1514Q, Y1699C, and M1869T occur in the Cor domain; R1941H, I2012T, G2019S, and I2020T occur in the MAPKKK domain; and T2356I and G2358R occur in the WD 40 domain. In addition, R793M and Q930R occur N-terminal to the functional domains. The most prominent of these substitutions is G2019S, which is common in French and North African families as well as Ashkenazi Jews (13) . It also occurs in approximately 1% of unselected PD cases, 3% to 6% of familial cases (13, 14) , and some normals. Penetrance varies. In one study, penetrance was found to range from 17% at age 50 to 85% at age 70 (15) . Most postmortem studies on patients with LRRK2 mutations have revealed the typical PD findings of nigral cell loss and extensive Lewy body distribution, but some have demonstrated Alzheimer-like neurofibrillary pathology, some multiple system atrophy-type pathology, and some progressive supranuclear palsy-like pathology.",

In the present study, we analyzed for the presence of LRRK2 mRNA in human astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia; in the human neuronal cell lines SH-SY5Y and LA-N-2 and in whole brain, liver, and heart. Using membrane-bound overlapping peptides covering the full Lrrk2 sequence, we identified the C-terminal binding site of a polyclonal anti-Lrrk2 antibody and performed an immunohistochemical analysis of a series of brains of patients with PD, including one member of a family with autosomal-dominant late-onset parkinsonism (family B) (19) as well as patients with diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), Alzheimer disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Pick disease, the parkinsonismYdementia complex of Guam (PDCG), and Huntington disease. We find that the LRRK2 gene is expressed in all cell types and organs studied; that the Lrrk2 protein occurs in the soluble state in normal brain; and that such pathologic entities as Lewy bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, and Pick bodies are recognized by a polyclonal antibody to Lrrk2.",

The number of cycles performed was 35. Two sets of primers were used. The primer sequences (5 \u00b6 to 3 \u00b6) were as follows: LRRK315F, 5 \u00b6-AGCTTATTGTCTGGTAGGATCTG; LRRK315R, 5 \u00b6-ATGGTGAGCCTTGGTTGATC; LRRK260F, TGAATGC CACCGAGGAATCTG; LRRK260R, GTGAACTGCGT GAGGAAGCT. After amplification, PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by incubation for 10 minutes in a solution containing 10 ng/mL of ethidium bromide. Polaroid photographs of the gels were taken. The predicted sizes of the PCR product were 315 and 260 bp, respectively. Restriction digest analysis of the 315 bp product by Dde I and that of the 260 bp product by Mbo I (GIBCO BRL; Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) resulted in 2 fragments corresponding to the predicted sizes of 255 and 32 bp and those of 180 and 73 bp, respectively (data not shown).",

No differences were observed between these 2 treatments.

This is illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 2 A shows a typical Western blot of human brain supernatant. The antibody to Lrrk2 stained a close doublet of higher molecular weight than 250 kDa, which roughly corresponds to the predicted value of full-length Lrrk2 with possible posttranslational modifications. Several other positive bands from 28 to 145 kDa may represent C-terminal fragments of Lrrk2. Strong bands were observed at approximately 62 and 32.5 kDa, suggesting major cleavages in the MAPKKK and WD 40 domains. This indicates that significant amounts of Lrrk2 C-terminal fragments are produced in brain, which, if retained in an insoluble state, would be recognized immunohistochemically. Figure 2B shows the results of probing Lrrk2 peptide membranes with the Lrrk2 polyclonal antibody NB 300-268. The figure shows that the region of the molecule recognized by the antibody is included in the sequence IEVRKE-LAEKMRRTSVE spanning residues 2511 to 2527 of the far C-terminal region of Lrrk2. Figure 3 shows panels A, B, C, and D of the Lrrk2 peptide membranes. It shows that recombinant >-synuclein binds to at least 3 regions in panel A (arrows) encompassing residues 423 to 442, 541 to 556, and 781 to 798.

Figure 4A illustrates positive cytoplasmic Lrrk2 immunostaining in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in a patient without neurologic symptoms and without identifiable brain pathology. Such positive neuronal staining was observed in all other brain areas examined, including the temporal, parietal, primary motor, and occipital cortices. Dopaminergic neurons of the SN also showed similar staining. Some Lrrk2-positive glial cells compatible with astrocytes ( Fig. 4B ) and reactive microglia (Fig. 4C) were also observed. No immunoreactivity was observed with control serum (Fig. 4D) . Figure 5 illustrates immunostaining of pathologic tissue in PD and DLBD. The anti-Lrrk2 antibody identified Lewy bodies in the SN in all sporadic PD cases and also in the familial PD case from family B (Fig. 5A, B) . A few Lrrk2-positive Lewy neurites were observed (Fig. 5C ). Lrrk2-immunoreactive Lewy bodies were also observed in the locus ceruleus and raphe nuclei in the pons and in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata. A similar strong Lrrk2 immunoreactivity of Lewy bodies was observed in the SN, brainstem, parahippocampal, and neocortical areas in DLBD. It was also observed in the AD case in which the AD-type cortical changes were combined with Lewy body pathology. Lrrk2-immunoreactive Lewy bodies in the middle temporal gyrus in a patient with DLBD are illustrated in Figure 5D . An example of Lewy bodies in a pyramidal neuron in the precentral cortex with slightly stained processes from the same DLBD case is shown in Figure 5E . When the SN of a patient with PD known to exhibit Lewy body pathology was doubly immunostained for Lrrk2 and >synuclein by immunofluorescence technique, the green Lrrk2 fluorescence (Fig. 5F ) and red >-synuclein fluorescence (Fig. 5G) of Lewy bodies overlapped and on merged fluorescent images yielded a yellowYorange fluorescence with a typical central core (Fig. 5H) .",

On doubly immunostained sections, in which Lrrk2 immunoreactivity was revealed in black and that of Tau C3-positive neurofibrillary tangles in brown, a subset only of neurofibrillary tangles exhibited a black Lrrk2 immunoreaction, whereas the remaining tangles showed only tau immunostaining. Figure 6 illustrates Lrrk2-immunoreactive pathology in PDCG. The anti-Lrrk2 antibody labeled neurofibrillary tangles (Fig. 6A ) and Lewy bodies (not shown here), which were observed in 4 of 6 PDCG cases in the brainstem and amygdala. In one case, Lewy bodies were also present in the neocortex. In addition, glial pathology, including astrocytic plaques (Fig. 6B) , Bhazy[ granules (Fig. 6C) , thorn-shaped astrocytes (Fig. 6D) , and oligodendroglial coiled bodies (Fig. 6E , F) all showed strong Lrrk2 immunostaining. Figure 7 illustrates Lrrk2 immunoreactivity in some other pathologies. Pick bodies show strong immunoreaction with anti-Lrrk2 antibody where it colocalizes with phosphorylated tau (Fig. 7AYE ). Lrrk2-positive intraneuronal inclusions were observed in motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord (Fig. 7F ) and glial inclusions in the degenerating corticospinal tracts (Fig. 7G) in the ALS cases. Intranuclear (Fig. 7H ) and some intracytoplasmic Lrrk2-positive inclusions were also observed in the brain of the 2 patients with Huntington disease. Figure 8 illustrates Lrrk2-positive reactive microglia and reactive astrocytes in the temporal white matter of a case with DLBD. Adjacent sections were used for double immunofluorescence staining. On the section doubly immunostained for Lrrk2 (green fluorescence, Fig. 8C ) and CR3/43, which recognizes activated microglia (red fluorescence, Fig. 8D ), the orange merged image (Fig. 8E) indicates that the cell is an activated microglia. Similarly, a section was double immunostained with anti-Lrrk2 antibody (green fluorescence, Fig. 8F ) and anti-GFAP (red fluorescence, Fig. 8G ). The orange merged image (Fig. 8H ) demonstrates the colocalization of Lrrk2 and GFAP in the same astrocytes. Some Lrrk2-positive reactive microglia and a few astrocytes were also seen, particularly in the white matter in some PD, AD, DLBD, and PDCG cases.",

It also identified cortical Lewy bodies in cases with DLBD. Double immunofluorescence staining clearly showed the overlap of Lrrk2 and >-synuclein immunoreactions in Lewy bodies in the SN of PD cases. In PDCG, which is known to be associated with parkinsonian features, Lrrk2 labeled not only a subset of neurofibrillary tangles, but in 4 of the 6 cases identified Lewy bodies in the brainstem and in one case cortical Lewy bodies.",

It is possible that the midregion sequence against which this antibody was raised is not as exposed in pathologic lesions as the far C-terminal sequence. It may also be that the antibody used in our experiments detects Cterminal fragments that are retained in an insoluble state and possibly bound to the pathologic deposits.

The findings will need to be confirmed using multiple antibodies on a much larger series of cases. The finding that LRRK2 mutations were also found in a few cases with AD also reinforces this possibility. This is in harmony with previous findings showing that in familial PD cases with LRRK2 mutations, heterogenic pathologic changes were observed at autopsy. Further histologic, biochemical, and molecular analyses studies may reveal that a common thread exists, possibly in protein phosphorylations carried out by its MAPKKK domain.",
