Since then in Indonesia, it has been farmed in at least 17 provinces. In 2012, Indonesia produced >400,000 metric tons of shrimp, with a value of >USD 2.5 billion, \u223c65% of which was cultured L. vannamei (Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Indonesia, 2013).",

The gross signs include whitened areas in the abdominal segments and tail fan, both regions rich in skeletal muscle. Histopathologically, these lesions are characterized by coagulative muscle necrosis with edema during the acute phase, progressing to liquefactive necrosis with hemocytic infiltration and fibrosis during the recovery or chronic phase. In some cases, perinuclear basophilic inclusion bodies are seen in the muscle cells and others (Lightner et al., 2004), consistent with the viral etiology of this disease. Horizontal transmission of IMNV has been shown to occur by cannibalism and is thought likely to occur through water as well (Lightner, 2011, Lightner, 2012). Vertical transmission from broodstock to progeny is also suspected.",

            "text": "The IMNV genome is nonsegmented; spans 7561 base pairs (bp) of dsRNA; and comprises two long, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) (Nibert, 2007, Poulos et al., 2006, Senapin et al., 2007). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein of 1605 amino acids (aa) thought to be processed co- or post-translationally into four separate polypeptides, designated 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Nibert, 2007, Tang et al., 2008). Polypeptide 1 (93 aa) is predicted to contain a classical dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) (Chang and Ramos, 2005, Nibert, 2007, Poulos et al., 2006), which seems likely to be involved in suppression of host defense responses; polypeptides 2 and 3 have unknown functions (but see below); and polypeptide 4 (901 aa) is the major capsid protein (MCP) (Poulos et al., 2006). The two ORF1 processing cleavages between polypeptides 1, 2, and 3 appear to be mediated by 2A-like translational stop/continue motifs (Firth and Brierley, 2012, Luke et al., 2008, Nibert, 2007) and are thus likely to be ribosome, rather than protease, mediated. The nature of the ORF1 processing cleavage between polypeptides 3 and 4 remains unknown. ORF2 is in the \u22121 frame relative to ORF1 and has the potential to encode a 912-aa product, designated polypeptide 5 (Nibert, 2007), which includes regions sharing strong sequence similarity with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of other dsRNA viruses (Poulos et al., 2006). Its translation is thought to require \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting in the region of ORF1/ORF2 overlap, yielding a polypeptide 4/5 fusion product (MCP/RdRp; 1734 aa) (Nibert, 2007). Indeed, a predicted RNA \u201cslippery\u201d sequence and pseudoknot characteristic of \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (Giedroc and Cornish, 2009) are found in the region of ORF1/ORF2 overlap.",

Its capsid is \u223c450 \u00c5 in diameter but notably contains lollipop-like fiber complexes extending by >80 \u00c5 beyond the capsid at the icosahedral fivefold axes. These fibers are probably functional in binding to cell-surface receptors and perhaps also in membrane penetration during cell entry (Nibert and Takagi, 2013, Tang et al., 2008). It is not yet known whether polypeptide 2 (284 aa), polypeptide 3 (327 aa), or both are responsible for forming these fibers (Tang et al., 2008). The IMNV capsid otherwise comprises 120 copies of the MCP arranged with T\n = 1 symmetry (2 copies of MCP per asymmetric unit) (Tang et al., 2008), and presumably 1 or 2 of these 120 copies is a component of the MCP/RdRp fusion product. Each virion would thereby contain 1 or 2 RdRp domains projecting into its interior cavity, where the RdRp(s) could function to package, replicate, and transcribe the viral genome, as known for other dsRNA viruses (Cast\u00f3n et al., 1997, Zhang et al., 2003).",

Notably, in 2006, IMN was also recognized in Indonesia (Senapin et al., 2007). The Indonesian outbreak was first noted on the island of Java, in East Java province, Situbondo regency, and by 2007 had spread east to the neighboring island provinces of Bali and West Nusa Tenggara. In the second half of 2008, IMN appeared to the west in the island province of Bangka Belitung and in Lampung province on the island of Sumatra. By 2009, the disease was also reported in Central Java, West Java, and North Sumatra provinces and across the Java Sea in West Kalimantan and South Sulawesi provinces. Although IMN has been rumored to occur elsewhere in Asia, this has been disputed (Senapin et al., 2011).",

The sequences reveal that these two strains share 99.6% nucleotide (nt) sequence identity, leading Senapin et al. (2007) and others (Lightner, 2012, Walker and Winton, 2010) to suggest that the IMNV appearing in Indonesia might have originated in Brazil and possibly to have spread by unregulated transfer of shrimp broodstock or postlarvae for aquaculture production, as thought to have occurred for some other shrimp-disease agents (Flegel, 2006). Partial sequences of three other strains, all from Brazil in 2004\u20132007, are also available in GenBank (see Section 2 for all accession numbers), but this small number of reported sequences has limited phylogenetic comparisons. To better elucidate the possible source and ongoing evolution of IMNV in Indonesia, we newly determined sequences of several IMNV strains sampled in 2011\u20132012. The results demonstrate clear genetic diversification of IMNV between Indonesia and Brazil, and conserved sequence motifs relating to polyprotein processing, ribosomal frameshifting, and protein functions.",

The two 2A-like, ribosomal stop/continue (Firth and Brierley, 2012) elements were encompassed by only the four complete sequences (Fig. 3B).

Since Ile has been found in this position in 2A-like elements from several other RNA viruses (porcine teschoviruses (family Picornaviridae), turkey avisiviruses (family Picornaviridae), and Israeli acute paralysis viruses (family Dicistroviridae) (e.g., GenBank accession nos.

Comparisons with other dsRBD proteins by using the programs HHpred and HHblits (Remmert et al., 2011) suggested this residue lies within the first \u03b2 strand of the conserved \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 structure and is not likely to be directly involved in dsRNA binding (Fig. 3C) (Chang and Ramos, 2005). This substitution may therefore have little effect on the function of this polypeptide, though that remains to be determined by direct testing. All aa substitutions found in ORF1 polypeptides 1/dsRBD, 2, 3, and 4/MCP in the four complete sequences are summarized in Table S2. Substitutions at two aa positions in polypeptide 4/MCP were the only ones that differentiated between multiple (three or four) Brazilian strains and multiple (eight) Indonesian strains (Table S2), and might therefore serve as markers for the two, geographically segregated IMNV subclades.",

The subclade relationships shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 are consistent with this suggestion, but are also consistent with the opposite direction of transfer, since the direction of time is undefined in unrooted trees such as these. The earlier appearance of IMN in Brazil (Lightner et al., 2004, Nunes et al., 2004, Senapin et al., 2007) is certainly consistent with the possibility that Indonesian IMNV may have originated in Brazil. Moreover, since L. vannamei has been cultured in Brazil since 1983 but in Indonesia since only 2001 (Briggs et al., 2004), transfer from Indonesia to Brazil seems less likely. Another possibility consistent with the current phylogenetic results, however, is that related ancestors of the Brazilian and Indonesian IMNV subclades may have been separately introduced to the two countries from a third, still unknown, geographical source.",

Despite the presence of these two subclades, it is important to recognize that they should continue to be considered members of the same viral species, since their extent of divergence remains so low to date (Table 1).",

Even though one consistent feature of most of the trees is a branch comprising the three recent East Java strains, the sampling of strains remains limited to date, and any ongoing human exchange of L. vannamei broodstocks or postlarvae between different regions of Indonesia might be expected to obscure or complicate such regional patterns over longer periods or with more intensive sampling. Thus, although strains representing distinct lineages of Indonesian IMNV as suggested in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 might continue to co-circulate for years to come, descendants of one lineage might come to dominate for particular reasons.

In contrast, exchange of IMNV between Indonesia and Brazil, or vice versa, almost certainly cannot occur by natural means, given the locations of these countries on opposite sides of the globe (though interestingly at similar latitudes just south of the Equator), emphasizing the likely role of humans in the dispersal of IMNV in the early 21st century.",

The distance between the end of the frameshifting \u201cslippery\u201d sequence and the start of this predicted pseudoknot is somewhat long, 8 nt, and the newly calculated minimum free energy (MFE) of this pseudoknot at 29 \u00b0C (average temperature recorded during IMNV epizootics) is \u221212.0 kcal/mol, vs. \u221210.1 kcal/mol at 37 \u00b0C. According to the program KnotInFrame (Theis et al., 2008) and others, however, this particular H-type pseudoknot is not the preferred one; instead, in the newly predicted, preferred pseudoknot, the S1 stem is shifted such that the distance between the end of the slippery sequence and the start of the pseudoknot is only 5 nt, and the pseudoknot has a greater predicted stability, MFE \u221212.9 kcal/mol at 29 \u00b0C (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the G \u2192 A substitution in the three Lampung strains does not strictly eliminate this pseudoknot, but rather causes the S2 stem to be shifted and allows an additional stem to form within loop 1 (labeled s1a:s1b in Fig. 3A), yielding a related, preferred pseudoknot with only a somewhat lower predicted stability, MFE \u22129.6 kcal/mol at 29 \u00b0C. The reduced stability of this predicted pseudoknot in the Lampung strains might reduce their efficiency of frameshifting to allow translation of the downstream, RdRp-encoding ORF2; however, this possibility, and whether any of these predicted structures are in fact the relevant ones, requires direct testing.",

Moreover, two of the sequences reported herein encompass the whole IMNV genome, doubling the previous number of complete sequences for this virus as well as corroborating the coding organization of IMNV and its known nt- and aa-sequence motifs of functional significance, including ones for \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting and ORF1 polyprotein processing. Phylogenetic comparisons involving the eight new and five previously reported IMNV sequences provide new insights into the possible source and ongoing diversification of IMNV between Indonesia and Brazil, as well as within Indonesia. Additional sequencing of IMNV strains in coming years should be expected to clarify the trajectory of IMNV evolution and the propensity of IMNV for spread to other parts of the world.",

The proposed slippery sequence in the region of ORF1\u2013ORF2 overlap is indicated by double underlines. The two main stems (S1A:S1B and S2A:S2B) of the predicted H-type pseudoknots are indicated by heavy underlines. Additional stems in loop 1 (s1a:s1b) or loop 2 (s2a:s2b) are indicated by regular underlines. MFE values calculated at 29 \u00b0C are shown at right. Gray shading highlights the unique G \u2192 A substitution in all three Lampung strains. At top is the original prediction for BZ-03 from Nibert (2007). In the middle are the predicted H-type pseudoknots from KnotInFrame for the eight IMNV strains whose determined sequences overlap this region. At bottom is a result from pKiss, shown only for BZ-03, to illustrate that the pseudoknot predicted for the Lampung strains can also be formed by the other strains, albeit with a lower predicted stability. (B) Polyprotein processing motifs as they occur between the intervening ORF1 polypeptides (pep1/dsRBD, pep2, pep3, and pep/MCP). Arrows indicate the \u201ccleavage\u201d sites between the polypeptides. The 2A-like elements (2ALE) at the pep1-2 junction (#1; aa positions 86\u201394) and the pep2-3 junction (#2; aa positions 370\u2013378) are labeled; aa positions 695\u2013714 are shown across the pep3-4 junction. Gray shading highlights the unique Val \u2192 Ile substitution in 2ALE#2 of ID-EJ-12-1. The partial sequences determined for ID-EJ-12-2, ID-EJ-12-3, ID-BB-12, ID-LP-12-1, and ID-LP-12-2 do not overlap the 2ALEs, as indicated by parentheses. (C) The aa sequence of polypeptide 1/dsRBD from IMNV strain ID-LP-11 is aligned with the 69-aa, second dsRBD from Xenopus RNA-binding protein A, for which a co-crystal structure with dsRNA (PDB ID, 1DI2) has been reported (Ryter and Schultz, 1998). The alignment and secondary-structure predictions (sspred; H/h, \u03b1 helix; E/e, \u03b2 strand; C/c, coil) between query (Q) and target (T) are those output by HHpred. The central line of text shows identities (|) and similarities (:,.) between the aligned aa sequences. Gray shading highlights the unique Lys \u2192 Glu substitution in ID-LP-11 relative to other IMNV strains. Heavy lines indicate the two regions of \u03b1 helix and lighter lines indicate the three regions of \u03b2 strand comprising the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 core seen in 1DI2. Residues that provide R-group contacts to dsRNA in the 1DI2 structure are shown by asterisks, and labeled with the dsRNA groove in which they bind.",
