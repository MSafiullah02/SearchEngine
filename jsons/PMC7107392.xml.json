However, type III ORF8s were detected in multiple bat species, including R. sinicus. We are the first to have found a type I ORF8 in bat lineage B beta-CoVs. Type I ORF8 is rare. In the country-wide screening, we found that only 2 CoVs collected from R. sinicus in Kunming City in Yunnan Province (Rs-betacoronavirus/Yunnan2013) and Hezhou City in Guangxi Province (Rs-betacoronavirus/Guangxi2013) contained type I ORF8s. Thus, according to the currently available data, R. sinicus is the only bat species that harbors SL-CoVs with type I ORF8. Additionally, R. sinicus is also the only bat species with SL-CoVs containing 2 different types of ORF8s. The type III ORF8 is the dominant type; type I is the minor type.",

This region of SARS-CoV experiences ongoing adaptive evolution in humans with gradual deletions (29-nucleotide, 82-nucleotide, or 415-nucleotide deletions) after transmission to humans [9\u201310]. The undeleted region of viruses with the 29-nucleotide deletion (the 29-nucleotide deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, represented by the GZ-A, Urbani, and TOR2 isolates) and viruses with the 82-nucleotide deletion (represented by the ZS-A and HGZ8L1-B isolates) also showed approximately 98% nucleotide sequence identities with the type I ORF8, with a few single-nucleotide mutations.

The ORF8 nearly identical to that in SARS-CoV was found only in SL-CoVs from R. sinicus and traces the source of SARS-CoVs to Chinese horseshoe bats. Functional studies for the proteins of ORF8, ORF8a, and ORF8b have been reported. The 8a protein enhances SARS-CoV replication and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis [11]. The expression of the 8b protein is related to DNA synthesis and the degradation of E protein [12\u201313]. The ORF8 protein may be functional in SL-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum [14]. However, the ORF8 region may code for a functionally unimportant protein for human SARS-CoVs, because gradual deletions in this region found in the early phase, the middle phase, and the late phase of the epidemic of SARS did not apparently affect the survival of the virus [9]. Thus, changes in this region can act as fingerprints to trace the genesis of SARS-CoVs. The identical ORF8s found in SL-CoVs from R. sinicus and SARS-CoVs from patients in the early phase of the SARS epidemic provides a link indicating that the first human infection with SARS-CoV may have originated from bats.",

Furthermore, the observation that SL-CoVs from R. sinicus are prone to recombine with CoVs from other hosts may suggest that the wildlife markets in Guangdong may provide an ideal incubator for the genesis of SARS-CoVs. Moreover, human consumption of wildlife increases the possibility of human exposure to viruses carried by wildlife.
