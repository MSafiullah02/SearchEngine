The Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) is committed to eliminating disparities, and increasing awareness of the critical issues that contribute to the differential outcomes experienced by gynecologic oncology patients. Health equity, defined as fairness and justice, exists only when people have an equal opportunity to be healthy. Health inequity, therefore, is the unfair and avoidable difference in health status seen within and between countries [1]. When defined structures or systems limit a person's ability to be healthy, inequities emerge. It is our goal to make gynecologic cancer patients, their caregivers and providers, aware of the issues that have been revealed, and amplified during the current global health crisis.",

A few studies have begun to address biases, both implicit and explicit, of patients towards providers [6]. Acknowledging bias is the first step towards reducing our reliance on generalizations or stereotypes. In a study of African-American cancer patients, providers scoring high on implicit bias tests were viewed as less supportive and spent less time with their patients than providers with low scores. These patients had more difficulty remembering what their physicians told them, less confidence in their treatment plans, and found it more difficult to follow recommended treatments [7]. Implicit biases worsen in times of stress [8]. During this high stress COVID-19 environment, implicit bias may be amplified, affecting health outcomes among many of our patients.",

On April 3, 2020, ProPublica reported, initial statistics in Milwaukee County, WI, 81% of the deaths from COVID-19 were among Black residents despite comprising only 26% of that county's population [11,12]. These death rates among Black residents in the county continue to be high, currently accounting for 50% of deaths from COVID-19 [13]. The Detroit News reported on April 2 that at least 40% of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Michigan were Black residents, a percentage that far exceeds the proportion of African Americans in the Detroit region and state [11,14,15]. In addition, more recent reporting in Chelsea, MA, Chicago, IL, and San Francisco, CA, have revealed local hot spots of COVID-19 among Hispanic/Latino and immigrant communities [16,17].",

Homeless populations are among the most vulnerable to infection with COVID-19. They disproportionately suffer from chronic illnesses including cancer, and \u201csocial distancing\u201d is also nearly impossible among this population [18,19]. One model using pre-COVID-19 health data from Los Angeles and New York City assumes potential 40% infection rates among the homeless and estimates that 4.3% of the nationwide homeless population (~21,295) would require hospitalization [20]. COVID-19 challenges for homeless populations throughout the country have only worsened but are difficult to quantify. Shelters are full, closed, or fraught with COVID-19 transmission risk due to crowded conditions. Despite increased demand among those with unstable housing, common places to find safe shelter such as libraries, gyms, and fast food restaurants are also closed. [18,19]. Data from rural populations has been limited, but concern about health care system capacity has already demonstrated strain in cancer care delivery and will become increasingly relevant [21].",

Data regarding the racial breakdown of NYC COVID-19 demographic data was not initially available, but it was clear by ZIP Code that certain communities were harder hit [22]. As of April 3, 2020, the highest case counts by ZIP Codes ranged from 409 to 1245 cases and were concentrated in parts of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, specifically in lower income communities of color although actual race data was not reported until April 8. [23]. As of April 24, 2020, racial disparities were confirmed by NYC COVID-19 mortality rates reported among both Hispanic/Latino (34%) and Black (28%) communities despite only representing 29% and 22% of the NYC population, respectively. Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos were more likely to die of COVID-19 than all other racial groups (Hispanic/Latino 55.3/100,000, Black 64.6/100,000, White 15.6/100,000, and Asian 33.1/100,000) [24].

Public health and social media messaging about staying home if ill, coupled with longstanding disenfranchisement from health care access, may have resulted in treatment delays leading to worse outcomes [29,30]. In NYC, it became clear that the most vulnerable under-resourced safety-net hospitals serving the most affected communities were quickly overloaded. Factors such as resource allocation, geographic location, and public versus private hospital systems have influenced access to necessary supplies and COVID-19 testing.

Yet at the same time, demonstrating the power of the patient voice and community partnership, these women are promoting strong evidence-based public health messaging using both ECANA and personal social media platforms to limit the impact of the pandemic [44]. They communicated the importance of staying home, social distancing, strategies for self-care, and addressing the frustration, and anger of the racial disparities related to COVID-19. When pandemics such as COVID-19 occur, the marginalized populations will always be at highest risk. Without the power of immediate connection with community-based groups, we as clinicians risk a costly delay in recognizing, assessing, and intervening to mitigate their extra vulnerability. Moving forward we can invest and engage with marginalized communities to provide real-time information and actionable solutions to blunt the impact of structural bias in our healthcare system and society.",

SGO advocates for the continued support of all our patients and health care personnel providing cancer care during this turbulent time. SGO and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) have published guidelines about adapting oncology care during this pandemic [45,46]. These recommendations are made to safely care for patients; however, underserved populations face significant barriers to adhering to these guidelines. Creative solutions must be considered to address these barriers; however, identification and acknowledgment that they exist is the first step. These guidelines must be tailored to address the specific needs and resources of our patients and their communities (Fig. 4\n). Cancer care delivery should be performed without the specter of discrimination, racism, implicit or explicit bias, and should factor in the social determinants of health in order to identify focused solutions.",

In the Medicaid non-expansion states, over half of low-income Americans who were uninsured in 2010 remain without access to affordable coverage. These Americans fall in the so-called coverage gap: they are not poor enough to qualify for traditional Medicaid, and yet do not earn enough to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. We must advocate for closing this loophole in coverage, which disproportionately affects underserved patients. This effort will be even more necessary as more cancer patients are left financially vulnerable, out of work and lacking insurance due to the COVID-19 crisis.",

Self-evaluation of comfortable and less comfortable spaces/circumstances is important to overcome these biases [49].

Meaningful community engagement at the level of the individual provider and our health care systems should be prioritized as we realize that we must collaborate to understand local needs and address them in sustainable ways. Institutional efforts and interventions can also be effective to address implicit bias. These efforts include conducting climate assessments, using evidence-based questionnaires, giving leaders feedback on that data, and providing ongoing training [50]. It is imperative to harness our energy to research and develop ways to diminish the heightened impact of glaring health care disparities and discrimination the pandemic has brought to the forefront. COVID-19 has exposed the tragic vulnerabilities of many of our patients and communities but has also revealed the depth of resiliency in providers, in community organizations, and in our cancer patients. Our experience addressing COVID-19 disparities in gynecologic cancer patients can translate to a more holistic dialogue about health equity, bringing all stakeholders to the discussion.
