The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators to provide protection against infectious airborne viruses in various workplace settings. The filtration efficiency of selected NIOSH-approved particulate N95 and P100 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and filter cartridges was investigated against the viable MS2 virus, a non-pathogenic bacteriophage, aerosolized from a liquid suspension. Tests were performed under two cyclic flow conditions (minute volumes of 85 and 135 L/min) and two constant flow rates (85 and 270 L/min). The mean penetrations of viable MS2 through the N95 and P100 FFRs/cartridges were typically less than 2 and 0.03%, respectively, under all flow conditions. All N95 and P100 FFR and cartridge models assessed in this study, therefore, met or exceeded their respective efficiency ratings of 95 and 99.97% against the viable MS2 test aerosol, even under the very high flow conditions. These NIOSH-approved FFRs and particulate respirators equipped with these cartridges can be anticipated to achieve expected levels of protection (consistent with their assigned protection factor) against airborne viral agents, provided that they are properly selected, fitted, worn, and maintained.",

The influenza virus can be spread from person to person in airborne droplets produced by the sneeze or cough of an infected person. (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that healthcare workers wear a respiratory protective device at least as protective as a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved, fit-tested, N95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) when in close contact to a patient infected by a respiratory pathogen (e.g., tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, and so on) thought to spread human to human via aerosol transmission. (2) Infectious viral aerosols are not well characterized and are poorly understood in the real world. A single virus can range in size from 20 to 300 nm. Although a single virus may be smaller than a bacteria particle (300 to 10,000 nm in size), viral aerosols likely exist as agglomerates or attached to inert particles. (3, 4) Infectious aerosols generated by coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing create a diverse size of particles ranging from less than 1 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm. (5) Measurements taken in a healthcare facility in the size ranges of <1 \u03bcm, 1-4 \u03bcm, and > 4 \u03bcm detected particles containing the influenza in each range at 4, 46, and 49%, respectively. (6) Although natural occurring virus aerosols likely exist as agglomerates, the infectious aerosol process is not well known and does not exclude the possibility of an infectious viral aerosol within the nanometer size range.",

(7) In order to verify respirator particulate filter efficiency, N95 FFRs and filter cartridges are challenged with a sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol having a count median diameter (CMD) of 0.075 \u03bcm and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.86. A light scattering photometer is used to measure the aerosol penetration on a mass basis at a constant 85 L/min flow rate. The mass-based penetration is the ratio of aerosol mass per unit volume measured upstream and downstream of the respirator filter. The certification requirements are intended to provide a measure of respirator filter performance during a severe condition with respect to flow and particle size, charge, and shape.",

(8) The NIOSHcertification method effectively only measures the penetration of particulate aerosols greater than 100 nm. (8) A count-based method offers better sensitivity within the nanometer size range than the photometry method since the efficiency is determined by measuring the actual number of aerosol particles that penetrate the respirator filter. Furthermore, a count-based method is more relevant to biological dosing hazards since the number of organisms deposited in the respiratory tract is one factor used to estimate the risk of infection. (9) Respirator filtration efficiency is dependent on particle size and face velocity. (3) Studies have found the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) of N95 filters is generally between 40 and 50 nm which is within the size range of individual viruses. (10) (11) (12) (13) Face velocity is related to the airflow through the filter and the available surface area of the filter. An increase in face velocity will increase the penetration within the MPPS range. (3) Flow pattern can also affect penetration. A normal breathing rate approximated by a cyclic sinusoidal flow rate though a respirator filter will result in a higher particulate penetration than a constant flow equivalent based on minute volume. (12) Additionally, peak flow rates measured during exhaustive work can exceed the 85 L/min NIOSH certification flow. (14) A high breathing rate and particles sized within the MPPS range may result in aerosol penetration exceeding that associated with the stated certification level.",

Studies have shown higher penetration of particles sized within the unagglomerated viral size range, (10) (11) (12) 23) compared to larger particles, but less is known about how much of the penetration is made up of viable viruses. A study by Balazy et al. (23) measured the total size-dependent penetration of a MS2 bacteriophage virus (MS2 virus) aerosol through N95 FFRs and surgical masks at a constant 85 L/min flow with a Wide-range Particle Sizer (WPS, MSP Inc., Minn.). The particle sizer counted and sized each particle in small intervals from 10 to 80 nm. Although particles were detected within each size range, the most counts were within the 30 nm interval when measuring the challenge aerosol. The authors speculated that the disperse aerosol was likely made up of agglomerates of cell fragments and viable cells. At the MPPS, approximately 50 nm, one of the N95 filters tested exceeded 5%. The authors concluded that NIOSH-certified FFRs may not provide the expected protection against viral aerosols. Although higher particulate penetration levels than expected were detected, the penetration may have been viral fragments or inert salts from the nebulized liquid suspension medium and not viable viral particles.",

Although healthcare workers primarily use N95 FFRs to protect against bioaerosol hazards, P100 FFRs and N95/P100 cartridges used with elastomeric half-mask respirators are also available for use. Thus, both types were included in the study. The FFRs and cartridges were obtained from several manufacturers to provide a range of selections. The FFRs and cartridges were tested as-received. The environmental conditions during testing were maintained at ambient temperature (25 \u00b1 3 \u2022 C) and relative humidity (40 \u00b1 10%). Tests were performed at two constant and two cyclic flow rates. The constant flow rates were 85 and 270 In addition to the minute flow, the sinusoidal cyclic flows have peak and mean inhalation flows. The peak inhalation flow (PIF) represents the highest rate of airflow during the inhalation phase of the breathing cycle. The mean inhalation flow (MIF) is the average rate of airflow over the entire inhalation portion of the breathing cycle. Previous research has shown that the PIFs and MIFs are important when looking at filter efficiency. (12, 28) The 270 L/min provided a constant flow condition equivalent to the PIF and MIF of the 85 and 135 L/min cyclic flow conditions, respectively. These flows represent extreme conditions that will not likely be encountered while wearing these types of filters. A more detailed description of the flows and justification for high flow test rates can be found in a companion study performed by Eshbaugh et al. (12) Since most non-powered air-purifying respirators use particulate cartridges in pairs, the cartridges were all tested at half the tidal volume or constant flow rate stated.",

Detectable quantities of MS2 penetrated the N95 FFRs/ cartridges, but the penetration was less than 5% in all cases. A slight increase in penetration ranging from a factor of two to three could be seen with an increase in either constant or cyclic flow rate, which is consistent with the literature. (12, 28) Particulate penetration is highly dependent on size and flow rate. (3, (10) (11) (12) As a result, particles larger or smaller than the MPPS will not penetrate as well. In this study, a nebulized suspension of MS2 was used as a surrogate test challenge to characterize the effectiveness of N95 and P100 FFRs and cartridges against infectious airborne viruses. Real-world viral aerosols are created by a cough, sneeze, or speech from an infected person. Most viral particles detected by Blachere et al. (6) in a healthcare setting during the peak of influenza season were greater than 1 \u03bcm. Conversely, as a result of the aerosolization techniques, most viable MS2 aerosol particles in this study were less than 1 \u03bcm. Although the individual MS2 virus was sized within the MPPS range, the viruses agglomerated with other viruses and dried solute particles to create a viable aerosol with a MMAD of approximately 500 nm. Even though the majority of the viable MS2 aerosol was not within the MPPS range, the aerosol was sized smaller than that measured by Blachere et al., (6) and thus was expected to be a more severe challenge than a naturally occurring viral aerosol. Even at high constant and cyclic flow rates in this study the measured viable penetration did not exceed 2%. Balazy et al. (23) had shown that 50 nm particles of a viral MS2 aerosol do penetrate and could exceed 5%, but it was not known whether the viable viruses penetrated or only fragments as the measurement technique detected both viable and nonviable particles. Similarly, Rengasamy et al. (11) found that the average penetration of some N95 respirator models exceeded 5% when challenged with a monodisperse 40 nm salt aerosol. The penetration only slightly exceeded 5% and was not found to be significantly different from the 5% limit.",

(24, 25, 27) Viable penetration is the ratio of culturable microorganisms that penetrate the filter to that determined in the bioaerosol test challenge, whereas physical penetration represents the fraction of all particles (viable or non-viable) that penetrate the filter. The penetration of both types of aerosols is dependent on the face velocity which is a function of the effective surface area of the filter and test flow rate. (3) However, viable penetration is also dependent on the bioaerosol's resistance to environmental degradation. Certain microorganisms are susceptible to desiccation and oxidation while airborne which can reduce their viability. (30) Robust bioaerosols, such as the MS2 used in this study, would thus be expected to yield comparable penetration values to physical (i.e., inert) aerosols of similar size.",

The 50 nm inert aerosol was selected since it is within the MPPS for N95 filters and is reasonably close in size to the NaCl test aerosol used by NIOSH to certify particulate respirators. (7) Only the N95 filters were used for comparison, since the P100 filters were generally very efficient against the MS2 aerosol. Penetration of the 50 nm salt particles was higher than that of the MS2 aerosol for every filter and flow rate combination, ranging from a factor of two to (most typically) over ten times higher penetration. This finding is expected since the larger MS2 particle size produced in this study would exhibit less penetration compared to bioaerosol or inert challenges in the MPPS range. Generally, the viable penetration values were similar to the 0.7 and 1.3 \u03bcm salt penetrations measured in Eshbaugh et al. (12) which is more consistent with the measured MS2 aerosol distribution used in this research.",

This is consistent with the constantcyclic flow comparisons for inert particle penetrations in Eshbaugh et al. (12) and Haruta et al. (28) Eshbaugh et al. (12) concluded that the penetration measured at the constant flow equivalent to the cyclic MIF or PIF more closely resembled the penetration measured at the cyclic flow. Haruta et al.

(6) Eninger et al. (31) tested the performance of N99 and N95 FFRs against an inert salt aerosol (NaCl) and three virus aerosols (MS2, T4, and Bacillus subtilis phage). All the aerosols had a large fraction of particles in the ultrafine range (\u223c20 to 500 nm).

Furthermore, filtration studies conducted using different microorganisms, bioaerosol dissemination methods, and test conditions (e.g., flow rates or relative humidity) would be expected to yield different penetration results. The findings from this study suggest that testing with inert aerosols in the MPPS range provides a very conservative estimate of respirator filtration efficiency against larger naturally occurring bioaerosols.

            "text": "Although not evaluated in this study, the level of protection afforded by an air-purifying respirator is predominantly dependent on the quality of the face seal. The majority of aerosol penetration occurs at the face seal interface and not through the filter material. (32) All masks need to provide a reasonable leak-tight face seal for optimum protection. For regulation of workplace respiratory protection programs, OSHA gives all FFRs and elastomeric half-mask respirators an assigned protection factor (APF) of 10 regardless of filter type (i.e., N95 or P100). (33) Thus, the respirator is only expected to reduce the outside aerosol by 90% (i.e., no more than onetenth the concentration of outside aerosol is allowed inside). The protection level (i.e., APF) is lower than the minimum N95 and P100 filter certification efficiency of 95 and 99.97%, respectively, to account for face seal leakage. In all cases, a well-administered respiratory protection program is necessary to evaluate hazards and to ensure that workers are provided with appropriate well-fitted respirators and properly trained in their use. Results from this study suggest that a good-sealing N95 or P100 particulate respirator worn to prevent exposure to a viral aerosol should perform adequately to meet the APF.",

            "text": "T he filtration efficiency of selected NIOSH-approved N95 and P100 FFRs and cartridges was assessed against a MS2 viable viral aerosol challenge under high volumetric flow conditions, representative of very high work rates. The N95 and P100 viable mean penetrations were typically less than 2 and 0.03%, respectively, under all flow conditions. Viral aerosols typically do not exist as single airborne viruses, instead they form agglomerates that typically are larger than the MPPS of the filter. (3, 4, 6) In the controlled laboratory conditions of this study, the resulting MS2 virus MMAD was approximately 500 nm. As a result, the viruses did not penetrate the filters to the extent of aerosols in the MPPS range (typically 40 to 50 nm for N95 filters). Thus, the N95 and P100 FFRs/cartridges tested in this study met or exceeded their efficiency criteria (95 and 99.97%, respectively) against the viable MS2 aerosol challenge even under very high flow breathing conditions.",
