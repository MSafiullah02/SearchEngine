Based on their conserved structure and functions, lectins can be categorized into 13 families, including chitinase-like, P-type, C-type, I-type, calnexin/calreticulin, L-type, R-type, F-box lectins, ficolins, intelectins, galectins, M-type, and F-type lectins [2]. The L-type lectin (LTL) family was the earliest lectin family to be discovered from the seeds of leguminous plants, which contain LTL-like domain] [3]. Four kinds of LTLs have been found in mammals: 36 kDa vesicular integral membrane protein (VIP36), ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53), ERGIC-53-like (ERGL) LTL, and VIP36-like (VIPL) LTL [4]. ERGIC-53 is a cargo receptor for the transport of glycoproteins from the ER to the ERGIC [5]. In this study, we characterized a novel LTL, a homolog of ERGIC-53, from shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus.",

Pathogen recognition is the first reaction of immunity; lectins consistently function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which can identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns located on the cell surface of pathogens [7]. LTL functions as a PRR in the immune response of Macrobrachium nipponense [8]. The LTL from M. japonicus plays a vital role as an opsonin in antibacterial immune responses [9]. ERGIC-53 functions as a PRR in the immune system of Eriocheir sinensis [10]. Conversely, ERGIC-53 helps in the replication of infectious arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus particles [11]. A novel L-type lectin is required for the multiplication of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in red swamp crayfish Procambarus clakii [12].",

            "text": "WSSV is a member of genus Whispovirus, which belongs to the Nimaviridae family. WSSV can infect more than 93 species of shrimp and prawn [13], including Litopenaeus vannamei, Penaeus monodon, and M. japonicas [14]. The cumulative mortality of shrimp could approach 100% in 7\u201310 days after WSSV infection. WSSV causes massive economic damage to shrimp farming worldwide [15]. WSSV is a capsule-coated virus; its four major envelope proteins, namely, VP24, VP28, VP26, and VP19, can form a protein complex [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. VP24, as a chitin-binding protein and the most abundant among the envelope proteins of WSSV, acts as a core protein interacting with other structure proteins and plays an important role in virus assembly and infection [20]. The absence of VP24 in WSSV-CN04, a new WSSV strain, can attenuate WSSV's peroral infectivity [21]. LvAMP13.4, a cuticle protein gene, helps WSSV invade cells by interacting with VP24 [22]. VP28 is another important structural protein in claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. Laminin receptor could bind to VP28 and help WSSV enter the host cell. Loss-of-function of the CqLR-like gene can result in strong inhibition of WSSV entry and viral replication [23].",

Three shrimps were selected randomly for tissue (hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gill, stomach, and intestine) collection to extract RNA.

A suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA library was used to identify differentially expressed genes in WSSV-infected shrimp Penaeus monodon. Many genes either inhibit viral replication or facilitate viral pathogenesis [33]. Endonuclease-reverse transcriptase in M. japonicus promotes anti-WSSV immunity by regulating superoxide dismutase activity, apoptosis, and phenoloxidase activity [34]. The Lvc-Jun gene could upregulate the activity of the wsv249 promoter to facilitate viral replication [35]. WSSV can regulate host immunity and take advantage of miR-S5 to regulate hemocyte phagocytosis and apoptosis [36]. Wsv187, which is encoded by the WSSV immediate early gene, activates the host's JAK/STAT pathway for replication [37]. Additionally, wsv249 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can mediate the ubiquitination of host immune effect molecules.

UPR is activated to alleviate ER stress [38] and consists of three signaling pathways that contribute to reducing the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen [39]. One of the UPR signal pathways is the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway. LvATF6 significantly upregulates the expression of many WSSV genes, such as wsv045 and wsv343, and could inhibit apoptosis for WSSV replication [40]. As indicated by a previous study, the homolog of ATF\u03b1 from M. japonicus is vital for WSSV replication, and UPR in M. japonicus may facilitate WSSV infection [41]. ERGIC-53 is a target of the ATF6 pathway of UPR [42]. PcL-lectin, a homolog of ERGIC-53, may interact with VP24 and is required for the multiplication of WSSV [12]. As a homolog of ERGIC-53, MjLTL2 may be a target of MjATF6 in M. japonicus and participate in WSSV proliferation.
