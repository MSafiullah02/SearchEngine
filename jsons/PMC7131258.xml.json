Main factors influencing reproductive efficiency in cattle include age at puberty and first conception, duration of post-partum anoestrus and total lifetime productivity. Lifetime production, or total weight of calves weaned during a cow's lifetime, is the most important output component of efficiency in the cow\u2013calf segment of beef production as it is a function of survival and reproductive performance of cows and of survival and growth rate of their offspring (Cundiff et al., 1992).",

            "text": "Therefore, the economic impacts of reproductive inefficiencies from the time of puberty to weaning can be substantial. Specifically, to improve herd productivity in northern Australia, unproductive periods in the reproductive life of the female must be reduced. These include reducing age at first calving and the post-partum anoestrus period and minimising fertilisation failure and embryo, foetal (pre-natal) and peri- and post-natal calf mortalities from conception to weaning. While marked year to year variation in weaning rate does occur in this environment, Hasker (2000) has suggested a production objective of 80 calves annually weaned per 100 cows mated. Therefore, this review investigates these unproductive periods that impact on the capacity of breeding females, grazing semi-extensive to extensive pastures in this region, to conceive, maintain a pregnancy and wean a calf at approximately 6 months of age. The prevalence and causes of the failure of a stage of the reproductive process are discussed where possible. Main causes of losses discussed include infectious and non-infectious causes. Where limited information exists for northern Australia in the areas identified above, information from international, extensive beef and intensive beef and dairy cattle studies are drawn upon to discuss the implications for reproductive efficiency in northern Australia.",

It is a vast region located within the subtropics and tropics; has a range of different production systems and environmental stressors; encompasses the state of Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of the state of Western Australia; and covers approximately 4 million km2 (Anon, 2008). Mean temperatures corrected to sea level makes this region comparable, in this respect, to other tropical regions of the world (Turner, 1975). Extreme maxima, mainly due to the great east-west extent of the continent in the vicinity of the Tropic of Capricorn, reach 50 \u00b0C over the inland in summer, while winters are warm in the north and cooler in the south, with overnight frosts common in inland areas south of the Tropic of Capricorn (Anon, 2008). Australia is relatively dry with 50% of the country having a median rainfall of less than 300 mm per year and 80% less than 600 mm (Anon, 2006). A monsoonal \u2018wet\u2019 season generally occurs in northern Australia from approximately November through April, when almost all the rainfall occurs, and a \u2018dry\u2019 season occurs from May through October (Anon, 2006).",

From the results presented, it would appear that weight at age of puberty has increased over the years from a mean value of 260 kg in Post and Reich (1980), to 321 kg in Burns et al. (1992b) to 334 kg in Johnston et al. (2009).

(1989) also reported that the onset of puberty is primarily a function of liveweight, that is, a physiological rather than a chronological age (Moran et al., 1989). Further, maturation involves a complex interaction between endocrine factors that results in the development of the reproductive tract and the rate at which this occurs depends mainly on genetic and environmental factors such as plane of nutrition throughout life that determines an animal's size and liveweight (Moran et al., 1989). Subsequently, for the majority of northern Australia production systems, genetic and nutritional constraints prevent the attainment of puberty in the majority of non-tropically adapted and tropically adapted B. taurus, B. indicus and B. indicus cross heifers as yearlings and supplementation strategies to attain this goal are not economically practical. Therefore, a more realistic strategy for heifer management in northern Australia to optimise female lifetime productivity is to ensure that all heifers have attained puberty by 2 years of age and are ready to conceive at the time when bulls are first introduced.",

Prolonged post-partum anoestrus has been identified as the major problem area of cow fertility in tropical northern Australian herds and can have a significant impact on herd profitability (Entwistle, 1983, Teleni et al., 1988). Intervals to first ovulation and first oestrus tend to be longer in B. indicus cattle particularly in first-calf cows (Teleni et al., 1988). On average in northern Australia, lactating B. indicius and B. indicus infused females will first ovulate 7 months post-partum and average weaning rates of 50\u201360% occur due to lactation anoestrus (Entwistle, 1983). A characteristic pregnancy pattern in young, tropically adapted breeding females in this northern Australian region is one in which females may only calve in alternate years, that is, heifers that conceive at 2 years old fail to conceive at the subsequent mating, but conceive again during the next mating season at 4 years old (Entwistle, 1983). This observation is not specific to B. indicius and B. indicus infused females in northern Australia as long calving intervals have also been reported in tropical production systems of Colombia where the calving interval for suckled zebu cows has ranged from 15.6 to 17.6 months (Olivera-Angel and Mart\u00ednez, 1990). Further, several factors reported to influence the length of this interval include pre- and post-partum nutrition/energy balance (Rutter and Randel, 1984, Ruiz-Cort\u00e9s et al., 1997); frequency of suckling (Randel, 1981, Ruiz-Cort\u00e9s et al., 1997), age (Dimmick et al., 1991) and body condition (Randel, 1990). These factors have also been observed to influence the length of the post-partum anoestrous interval in tropical beef cattle in northern Australia.",

In two international studies, embryo mortalities in B. taurus beef heifers in temperate environments accounted for more than 30% (Diskin and Sreenan, 1980) and 25\u201328% (Roche et al., 1981) of reproductive inefficiency in heifers. EEM accounted for about 75\u201380% of all embryo and foetal mortalities, with the greatest mortalities occurring between days 8 and 18 after fertilisation (Diskin and Sreenan, 1980, Roche et al., 1981). Of the remaining mortalities, most estimates suggest that about 10\u201315% mortality occurs at or near the time of implantation (days 25\u201345) and 5\u20138% mortality between placental attachment and birth (Sreenan and Diskin, 1983). Therefore, the reported levels of embryo mortality in tropical beef cattle genotypes in northern Australia are comparable with those levels reported for B. taurus beef heifers in temperate environments and represent a significant source of reproductive inefficiency.",

In another study, peri-natal mortalities of 6% and 12%, respectively, were reported for the 2004 calving period for 4 and 5-year-old Brahman and Tropical Composite cows grazing drought affected Mitchell grass pastures in the tropical, semi-arid region of north-west Queensland where environmental temperatures in this production system during the summer months are extreme (>40 \u00b0C) (Holroyd et al., 2005). In the following year, a combined mortality of 41% (167/407) was recorded for the same group of Brahman and Tropical Composite cows from parturition up to 15 weeks post-calving with 75% occurring within 24 h of birth (Holroyd et al., 2005). These losses were much higher than expected in this class of cattle grazing Mitchell grass pastures in this production system and a detailed clinical, pathological and biochemical investigation identified that gestational Vitamin A deficiency was an important contributor to these high peri-natal calf mortalities (Hill et al., 2009).",

Pre-natal mortalities reported from a number of South American reproductive studies (mid-1980s\u2013late 1990s), involving B. indicus, B. indicus\n \u00d7 \nB. taurus cross and adapted B. taurus breeding herds, ranged from 5.3% to 17%: (1) Venezuela (Plasse et al., 1998 (7.9%); Linares and Rodriguez, 1983 (12.5%); Hoogesteijn et al., 1983 (17%); and Vera and Ser\u00e9, 1985 (16%)); (2) Brazil (Vera and Ser\u00e9, 1985 (8%)); (3) Colombia (Vera and Ser\u00e9, 1985 (14%)) and (4) Bolivia (Plasse et al., 1993 (5.3%)). In addition, Plasse et al. (1998) reported a mean pre-weaning (birth to weaning) mortality of 4.9% (range \u22122.4 to 11.5%) from the same Venezuelan reproductive performance study above. The differences in the levels of mortalities reported for herds in northern Australia compared to those reported above for South American herds could be a reflection of the: extensiveness of the cattle operations; different levels of management and disease control; and different levels of accuracy in recording results in these two regions.",

Given the range of factors that may be responsible for these mortalities in northern Australia, any attempt to reduce mortalities below these levels may not be economically sound. While a number of the studies referred to in this review have reported levels of mortality of the same magnitude as the \u2018acceptable levels\u2019 just discussed, other levels of reported mortalities are well above these levels and subsequently have a significant impact on herd profitability. Therefore, these \u2018acceptable levels of mortalities\u2019 should be used as a benchmark in northern Australia and higher levels of mortalities warrant further investigation.",

BVDV infections are considered to be the most important viral pathogens of cattle in Australia as they also cause embryo mortality, abortion, foetal mummification, congenital malformations, stillbirths and mortalities at any age from birth (Kirkland and MacKintosh, 2006). These losses follow infection of susceptible females by direct contact with persistently infected cattle between the time of mating through to 180 days of gestation (McGowan and Kirkland, 1995, Kirkland and MacKintosh, 2006). Level of cattle control/management can be a major factor associated with the incidence of BVDV in northern Australian herds. Increased segregation of younger breeding females can lead to an increase in proportions of herds susceptible to BVDV. A combination of serological survey, management and vaccination can minimise losses due to BVDV.",

BEF occurs as seasonal outbreaks associated with rain periods in the region (Kirkland, 1993). In areas of northern Australia with more reliable wet seasons, outbreaks occur in most years and most cattle are immune before becoming adults (Kirkland, 1993).

Once again, the extensive nature of the industry in this region can make diagnoses difficult and as a result the relative impact of these diseases on the reproductive performance of northern Australian herds is not clear. In relation to embryo mortalities, BVDV can cause immunosuppression (impair bactericidal, fungicidal and virucidal mechanisms in the uterus) resulting in a hostile uterine environment for the embryo and subsequent embryo mortality (Kirkland and MacKintosh, 2006). Campylobacteriosis is venereally transmitted by infected bulls during coitus and is responsible for late embryo mortalities. The disease can be diagnosed from preputial samples in bulls and vaginal samples in heifers. Trichomoniasis is also venereally transmitted by infected bulls, however, compared to campylobacteriosis it is responsible for earlier embryonic mortalities. Both diseases are prevalent in the prepuces of older bulls. The spread of both campylobacteriosis and trichomoniasis can be reduced by mating younger, na\u00efve heifers with younger disease-free bulls. Vaccination of bulls and heifers may also assist control against campylobacteriosis.",

While leptospirosis is often considered as the most likely cause of increased mortalities between pregnancy diagnosis and weaning, its significance as a cause of reproductive failure in Australian beef cattle herds has been somewhat circumstantial and as a result has come under increased scrutiny (Smith et al., 1997). While the evidence linking L. pomona to foetal mortalities is much more substantial, the prevalence of infection with this serovar is significantly less than that recorded for L. hardjo (Hallett et al., 1996). As L. hardjo does not normally infect the foetus, other infectious agents such as N. caninum could be a more significant cause of bovine foetal mortality (Smith et al., 1997). While L. tarrassovi has been demonstrated to infect cattle in northern Australia, the significance of this infection has not been determined (Hallett et al., 1996).",

(1981). Mortalities (14/21) were observed in both Hereford and B. indicus cross calves during summer on the Barkly Tablelands (Mitchell et al., 1981). There appeared to be a strong association between calves with diarrhoea and those that were heat stressed. This observation is supported by a North American study (Clement et al., 1995) where hot humid summer weather was identified as an important risk factor associated with an increased incidence of calf mortality due to diarrhoea. Eimeria spp. which causes coccidiosis in calves about 21 days after birth or a stress event can be an important cause of diarrhoea in calves (Parker et al., 1986). This condition occurs commonly in calves post-weaning under northern Australian conditions (Parker et al., 1986). Acute undifferentiated diarrhoea, caused by an interaction between enteropathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa, the colostral immunity of the animal and the effects of the environment, has been reported to cause mortalities in intensively reared newborn calves under 30 days of age in North America (McDonough et al., 1994). Collectively, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, verocytotoxic E. coli, necrotoxic E. coli, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. have been reported to be responsible for 75\u201395% of infections in neonatal calves worldwide (Kodituwakku and Harbour, 1990). However, these infectious agents are not readily differentiated on clinical findings alone which include dehydration, emaciation and a fluid filled intestinal tract with no other obvious gross lesions (McDonough et al., 1994). The incidence of clinical disease due to these pathogens under extensive northern Australian conditions is unknown as most calves are born late in the calendar year generally during the start of the monsoonal wet season when cattle are not handled.",

Gossypol contained in cottonseed has been reported to impair the fertility of some natural service dairy bulls in North America by decreasing sperm production, sperm motility and the proportion of normal spermatozoa (Risco, 2000). While a number of additional studies (Gu et al., 1990, Gu et al., 1991, Lin et al., 1994, Zavy, 1994) have also implicated gossypol and one of its major metabolites (gossypolone) in causing embryo mortalities, one Australian study (Cusack and Perry, 1995) found no effect. Therefore, given the amounts of cottonseed meal and whole cottonseed that are used as a cattle feed supplement in northern Australia and the lack of any reports of gossypol causing significant reproductive inefficiencies in this region, it would appear that cottonseed meal and whole cottonseed can continue to be fed as supplements.",

In earlier studies, hyperthermia was reported to cause post-natal mortalities in unadapted genotypes (Daly, 1971, Entwistle, 1974).

Physical defects or low libido in bulls can be a cause of fertilisation failure in B. indicus and B. indicus cross heifers/cows in both single- and multiple-sire herds (Entwsitle and Fordyce, 2003). Percent morphologically normal sperm, an easily measured and moderately to highly repeatable trait in bulls once they have reached sexual maturity, has been reported to be one of the main factors affecting calf output of individual bulls in northern Australia under multiple sire mating conditions (Fitzpatrick et al., 2002, Holroyd et al., 2002, Fordyce, 2005). About 35% of bulls tested in this environment have been reported to have less than 70% normal sperm and 15% produced less than 50% normal sperm (Fitzpatrick et al., 2002, Holroyd et al., 2002). The level of additive genetic variance for sperm morphology is unknown.",

Further, the presence of a family of heparin binding proteins (HBP) on sperm has been reported to be useful in predicting a measure of a bull's potential fertility (Bellin et al., 1994, Bellin et al., 1998). Heparin-binding proteins (HBP) are produced by the bull's accessory glands, secreted into the seminal fluid (Nass et al., 1990) and upon ejaculation bind to sperm (Miller et al., 1990). The addition of HBP to epididymal sperm induces heparin-stimulated acrosome reactions (Miller et al., 1990). Bellin et al. (1994) reported that groups of bulls with the greatest affinity for HBP-B5 in sperm membranes, but not in seminal fluid, had greater fertility than did groups with other HBP-B5 profiles. However, a study of tropically adapted bulls in northern Australia questioned the efficacy of this association as bulls without detectable HBPs on sperm membranes sired as many calves as those with HBPs (Fitzpatrick et al., 2002). As well, only 7% of bulls were identified without HBP in their sperm membranes (Fitzpatrick et al., 2002).",

Brahman (B. indicus) cattle have been observed to have up to four large follicles (or waves) occurring in sequence during an oestrous cycle (Rhodes et al., 1995\u2014post-pubertal, nulliparous heifers) compared to generally two in B. taurus dairy cattle (Ginther et al., 1989c\u2014nulliparous heifers) and sometimes three in B. taurus dairy \u00d7  beef cattle (Savio et al., 1988\u2014post-pubertal, nulliparous heifers) and B. taurus dairy cattle (Sirois and Fortune, 1988\u2014nulliparous heifers). It has been reported that the proportion of animals with two or three waves per cycle varies between herds (Sirois and Fortune, 1988 (nulliparous heifers); Ginther et al., 1989a (nulliparous B. taurus dairy heifers)) and is repeatable for individual Brahman heifers (Rhodes et al., 1995) and other B. taurus heifers and cows (Ginther et al., 1989b\u2014post-pubertal, nulliparous dairy heifers; Ahmad et al., 1997\u2014pubertal beef heifers and multiparous lactating beef cows), and varies with nutrition (Murphy et al., 1991) and body condition (Burke et al. (1995). The growth of the ovulatory follicle can be longer by 2\u20133 days in animals with two compared to three waves (Ginther et al., 1989c). The health/competence of the oocyte can decline under prolonged dominance (Mihm et al., 1994, Ahmad et al., 1995, Oussaid et al., 2000) which is reflected in pregnancy rates decreasing from >80% following a short duration of dominance to <20% following an extended duration (Mihm et al., 1994). These results suggest that earlier conception patterns may be achieved in northern Australian herds by elevating nutrition levels through a targeted supplementation strategy to increase body condition and hence the incidence of three follicular waves per cycle. However, the opportunity for genetic improvement by selecting animals for three follicular waves has not been fully determined and further research is required in this area.",

(1989) concluded that this was probably a consequence of the higher number of reproductive tract abnormalities that occur with increasing age, as reported by Christensen (1980). This conclusion is supported by reports from dairy and beef cattle studies that indicate that increased age and parity of the uterine environment can result in oviduct obstructions, abnormal ova, ovarian adhesions, endometritis and high plasma progesterone concentrations just prior to oestrus affecting ova development and all can potentially have an adverse affect on fertilisation rate (Ayalon, 1969, Biggers, 1969, Roche et al., 1981). These results suggest that both selection for cervical size and shape in conjunction with the culling of cows with abnormal reproductive tracts along with culling of non-performing and older breeding females should alleviate these problems and reduce reproductive inefficiencies.",

The reported low incidence of dystocia in tropical environments (Entwistle, 1983, Holroyd, 1987) reflects: the genotypes used as B. indicus (Cartwright et al., 1964) and tropically adapted B. taurus (Burns et al., 1992a, Herring et al., 1996) genotypes have the maternal ability to produce smaller calf sizes; first calving generally occurring at three rather than 2 years of age; generally lower levels of nutrition occurring during late pregnancy (reduced calf size); and possibly that a degree of natural selection is operating as under extensive grazing conditions with no calving supervision the final result of dystocia is usually death of both dam and calf (Entwistle, 1983, Holroyd, 1987). However, when dystocia problems have been observed in northern Australian environments they have been generally associated with foeto-pelvic disproportion and related to the use of: yearling mating in British breed heifers in southern areas of northern Australia (Norman, 2003); large European breeds such as the Simmental in central Queensland (Burns et al., 1992a); and Charbray bulls mated to primiparous Brahman heifers to calve at 3 years in a Northern Territory study in which approximately 4% of calves were lost as result of dystocia (Brown et al., 2003).",

Abandoned calves, maternal mortalities, congenital abnormalities and weak calves at birth contributed to an overall higher rate of peri-natal and post-natal mortalities in Sahiwal than in Brahman genotypes (Holroyd, 1987). One of the most important factors causing mortalities was bottle teats with the prevalence higher in Sahiwal compared to Brahman genotypes and increased with advancing age (Frisch, 1982, Entwistle and Goddard, 1984, Holroyd, 1987). Holroyd (1987) suggested that the more nervous temperament of the Sahiwal compared to the Brahman (Fordyce, 1985) could have been part of the reason for the higher mortalities observed during the peri-natal period. In a subtropical environment, Burns et al. (1992a) reported higher post-natal calf mortality in Hereford calves compared with Belmont Red calves. Reductions in post-natal mortality as the B. indicus (Frisch, 1973) or tropically adapted B. taurus (Frisch, 1973, Burns et al., 1992a) content of the calves increased suggests that post-natal calf survival in tropical environments may partially reflect increasing environmental adaptation.",

Research suggests that impaired IFN-\u03c4 gene expression in the trophectoderm layer from the time of blastocyst hatching (days 8\u20139) until implantation may retard successful maternal recognition of the embryo around day 15 of pregnancy in the cow (Mathialagan and Roberts, 1994). In addition, genetic differences in the fertilisation rates of sires and a genetic effect of the dam and her sire in the dam's capacity to maintain pregnancy have been observed (Bar-Anan et al., 1980). Further, chromosomal abnormalities may occur either due to a hereditary factor, or because of spontaneous changes during gametogenesis, at fertilisation or during embryo development and not related to the chromosomal make up of the sire or dam (King, 1990).",

The resultant higher genetic variation that exists for fertility is reflected in the higher, but moderate, heritability estimates reported for B. indicus cattle (Deese and Koger, 1967, Seebeck, 1973, Cruz et al., 1978, Thorpe et al., 1981, Turner, 1982) than for B. taurus cattle (Davenport et al., 1965, Dearborn et al., 1973). The hypothesis that female fertility can be indirectly improved by selection on male fertility traits (Land, 1973) is supported by favourable genetic correlations in sheep (Walkley and Smith, 1980) and cattle (Mackinnon et al., 1989). Changes in female reproductive characteristics by selection in the pre-pubertal ram for high LH response to GnRH challenge were demonstrated in sheep (Evans et al., 1989) and may exist in cattle as there is genetic variation (h\n2\n > 0.5) between young bulls in their ability to secrete testosterone in response to GnRH stimulation (Mackinnon et al., 1991). These genetically influenced hormonal control mechanisms coupled with reports that fertility is repeatable (Rudder et al., 1976, Goddard, 1980, Seifert et al., 1980, Entwistle, 1983, Entwistle, 1984, Winter et al., 1985, Mackinnon, 1988, Mackinnon et al., 1987, O\u2019Neill et al., 2000) suggest that an opportunity exists to genetically improve calf output in tropical genotypes in northern Australia, partly by reducing reproductive inefficiencies.",

Since 1983, the cause of 35.9% of all peri-natal calf mortalities and 49.3% of all post-natal calf mortalities in B. indicus derived cattle in a north Queensland study were unknown (Holroyd, 1987). Pre-natal and post-natal calf mortalities due to unknown causes were reported for Hereford and Belmont Red genotypes in a two-phase study in central southern Queensland (Coates and Mannetje, 1990; Table 2). A 3.6% peri-natal calf mortality that was classed as due to unknown causes was observed in Brahman calves in the Northern Territory (Brown et al., 2003). Additional northern Australian studies have also reported pre-natal and calf mortalities due to unknown causes (Fordyce et al., 1990, Brown et al., 1994, Schlink et al., 1994, Brown, 1998). There would appear to be little progress in determining causes of pre-natal and calf mortalities from confirmed pregnancy to weaning since 1983. This situation reflects the difficulties of investigating causes of mortalities in extensive herds because of the inability to observe cattle on a daily basis and the remoteness from laboratories.",

Vaccination against Leptospirosis may also reduce losses in some situations. Further, vaccination of cows pre-calving and calves during suckling against clostridial diseases will prevent mortalities due to tetanus and botulism.(v)Control predators where there is a risk that these may cause significant calf mortality.\n(2)Specific management programs:(i)Bullsi.Use bulls that have passed a Bull Breeding Soundness Evaluation (BBSE) prior to their initial mating.ii.Join bulls at 2 years old and cull them at 7 years old to minimise reproductive losses due to venereal diseases and subfertility and infertility and their association with older dominant bulls.\n(ii)Heifersi.Prevent dystocia in females calving at 2 years of age by initially preventing such matings and also, where possible, preventing matings of low liveweight maiden heifers. Select sires with traits indicative of calving ease when the information is available for use over maiden 2-year-old heifers. Segregate pregnant yearlings, if this occurs, for management to sustain them in moderate to good body condition throughout pregnancy and supervise calving and provide assistance.ii.Nutritionally manage heifers from weaning to joining at 2 years old to ensure that all heifers have reached puberty and are cycling normally when first exposed to bulls to ensure early conceptions and subsequent early calving in the following year to maximise the probability of early reconceptions and the production of heavier calves at weaning.iii.Control mate heifers for approximately 3 months or less depending on animal numbers and season, at 2 years old, and non-pregnant heifers subsequently culled.iv.Manage heifers as a 3-year-old lactating group which may involve access to better quality pastures or supplementation and early weaning practices to minimise liveweight loss and mortalities and maximise reconceptions.\n(iii)Mature breedersi.Grazed at acceptable stocking pressures and receive strategic supplementation as a normal practice depending on the production system or during times of drought;ii.Early weaning strategies employed as a normal management practice or during times when nutrition levels are compromised by drought.iii.Cows that do not wean calves in consecutive years are culled.iv.Depending on numbers of breeding females available (dependent on weaning rates), all non-lactating cows at the time of weaning are grouped together and pregnancy diagnosed to determine if pregnant and stage of pregnancy and cows that are non-pregnant or will calve late in the season are culled to remove inefficient non-pregnant or late pregnant breeding females to tighten up the herd calving patterns for ease of herd management during failed wet seasons and droughts.v.Older cows are culled after weaning at 10 years of age to avoid survival and reproductive tract problems.\n\n\n",

The authors have also reported on the implications of the impact of these factors on conception to weaning and offered recommendations to reduce the impact of these factors. However, in recent times, a major concern of funding agencies has been the slow adoption rates of research results by the Australian beef cattle industry in general. Given this trend, coupled with the current global financial situation, increasing costs of production and labour shortages, the prospects for increasing the uptake of new information/strategies and technologies by the northern beef industry are limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider new strategies that might improve the rate of adoption and implementation of research results and recommendations. While it is still critical to maintain the integrity of \u2018government managed\u2019 research facilities to conduct more basic research activities, it is also important to consider \u2018new research models\u2019. These \u2018new research models\u2019 should focus on more applied research/investigatory studies being conducted on \u2018industry enterprises\u2019 (\u2018satellite industry research enterprises\u2019) across a range of different northern Australian production system environments in collaboration with strategically located \u2018government managed\u2019 research facilities. These government\u2013industry collaborative/partnership research activities would facilitate a better understanding of factors limiting reproductive performance in these various production systems, the implementation of a standard industry language and measurement techniques to assist in describing and quantifying the impact of these factors and the subsequent adoption and implementation of strategies to improve overall herd productivity and profitability. Over time, the results from the more basic research activities conducted on \u2018government managed\u2019 research facilities could be evaluated/validated in these \u2018satellite industry research enterprises\u2019.",
