Of the six human-infecting coronavirus strains, four (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) are currently co-circulating and elicit respiratory illnesses (Vabret et al., 2009). Coronaviruses also represent a significant public health concern due to the recent zoonotically emerged, highly pathogenic species, SARS corovonavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003) in 2002\u20132003 and, since 2012, Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012), localized to the Arabian Peninsula, but with sporadic travel-related outbreaks worldwide. In addition to their respiratory tropism, human coronaviruses have been detected concurrently with severe and acute neurological symptoms (Arabi et al., 2015, Morfopoulou et al., 2016, Yeh et al., 2004) and shown to naturally infect the central nervous system (CNS) (Arbour et al., 2000, Gu et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2005) with neurons demonstrated as the main target of infection in HCoV-OC43 (Bonavia et al., 1997, Favreau et al., 2012, Jacomy et al., 2006, Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) and SARS-CoV (Gu et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses represent the largest known enveloped RNA (single-stranded positive sense) viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kb (de Groot et al., 2012). The viral envelope is composed of four or five proteins, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), the latter in some \u03b2 coronaviruses genus, such as HCoV-OC43. Coronavirus E proteins are 74\u2013109 amino acids in length, 84 amino acids for HCoV-OC43, and share only a small amount of sequence identity between coronavirus species. However, its secondary structure, composed of a short N-terminal domain followed by a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) and hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail, remains overall conserved and is suggested to be more important than sequence for function (Kuo et al., 2007, Torres et al., 2005). The importance of the presence of the E protein in the viral envelope is emphasized by the fact that there are only about twenty E molecules incorporated within the virion structure (Godet et al., 1992, Liu and Inglis, 1991, Yu et al., 1994) and deletion of the protein can either completely prevent the production of detectable infectious virions (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013, Curtis et al., 2002, Ortego et al., 2007, Ortego et al., 2002) or significantly reduce infectious virus titers (DeDiego et al., 2008, DeDiego et al., 2007, Kuo et al., 2007, Kuo and Masters, 2003).",

It is in this intracellular region that additional functions mediated by various domains of the coronavirus E proteins are proposed to occur. Homo-pentameric oligomerization of the E protein TMD in membranes to form ion channels, called viroporins, has been predicted for several coronaviruses (Torres et al., 2005) and extensively studied for species such as SARS-CoV (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014, Pervushin et al., 2009) or avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Ruch and Machamer, 2012, Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015). Another domain found at the extreme C-terminal end of the E protein, a PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), has also been predicted for several coronavirus species (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014). This protein-protein interaction motif capable of interrupting normal cellular functions, has been demonstrated in other viruses to play important roles in replication, dissemination in the host and pathogenesis (Javier and Rice, 2011). The multiple properties of coronavirus E proteins have not yet been fully investigated or explained, and can at times differ between coronavirus species. The multifunctionality of the E protein could be explained by the presence of two distinct pools (monomeric versus homo-oligomeric states) present in the infected cell (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015). Furthermore, the different motifs found within the protein (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015) could mediate different specific functions. The coronavirus E protein was also recently recognized as an important virulence factor for the SARS-CoV (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014), where deletion of the whole or part of the protein led to an attenuated pathology in mouse lungs (DeDiego et al., 2008, DeDiego et al., 2007), attenuation which was later linked to the E protein TMD and PBM (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014, Nieto-Torres et al., 2014).",

Subsequently, a transient co-transfection was conducted in the same cells with pBAC-E-Stop and pcDNA(OC-E) and, by making use of a monoclonal antibody against the S protein of HCoV-OC43, we confirmed that the co-transfection did not affect transfection efficiency, and that the viral S protein was produced at equivalent levels in cells transfected with pBAC-OC43FL alone or pBAC-E-Stop with pcDNA(OC-E) or empty plasmid (Fig. 1D). Following the co-transfection, infectious particles production was rescued to detectable levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E).

Throughout the amplification process we were consistently unable to detect infectious viral particles issuing from viral stocks of rOC/E-Stop. Amplifications of initially complemented viral stocks of rOC/E-Stop led to detectable titers which decreased over the course of each subsequent amplification compared to rOC/ATCC. Sequencing of viral RNA confirmed that the E gene in the viral rOC/E-Stop stocks contained the introduced stop codon at each amplification step (data not shown).

Initially complemented rOC/E-Stop, previously recovered from transfection on BHK-21 cells (P0), was used for infection and infectious viral titers determined over a period of 72 h post-infection (hpi). This revealed an important decrease of infectious virus production for human cells (\nFig. 2A), which was exacerbated in primary murine cells, where virus titers were under the limit of detection (Fig. 2B). However, in these primary cultures, low levels of infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence (IFA) where we detect the viral S protein, suggesting that infection was possible even for the complemented rOC/E-Stop virus but that production of new infectious progeny and eventual propagation were severely inhibited compared to wild type virus (Fig. 2C).",

Only the infectious titer was quantified in the cell-associated fraction as (with our system of q-RT-PCR), we are not able to differentiate between viral genomic and subgenomic RNA and between viral RNA that would be inserted in virion or free in the infected cell. Similar levels of viral infectious particles were measured in the cell-associated fractions for both viruses at 16hpi indicating that the cells have been infected with the same efficiency and that the viral replication early steps are not affected by the alteration of the TMD. However infectious viral titer in the supernatant (cell-free fraction) of cells infected with rOC/E-TMQ17A was significantly reduced compared to cells infected with rOC/ATCC, although both viruses produced similar amount of total viral particles. These findings are supported by immunofluorescence assay showing a delay in propagation of rOC/E-TMQ17A over 72 hpi compared to reference virus (Fig. 3E, Figure S1A and B).",

We sought to investigate whether the putative four-amino acid E protein PBM of HCoV-OC43 modulates production of infectious particles and infection of susceptible cells. To this end, we modified our cDNA infectious clone to change the two key amino acids of the putative PBM motif, at the \u22120 and \u22122 positions from the C-terminal end respectively, into inert alanines, and thereby abrogated putative motif recognition by potential interaction partner(s). Single amino acid mutants (pBAC-OC-E-PBM-D82A and pBAC-OC-E-PBM-V84 A) or double mutant (pBAC-OC-E-PBM-D82A-V84A) (Fig. 1A), were transfected in BHK-21 cells and amplified on HRT-18 cells at the same multiplicity of infection and compared to reference virus (\nFig. 4A).

In LA-N-5 cells, after 18 hpi, the titers of rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A were significantly decreased in the cell-free and cell-associated virus fraction compared to single PBM mutants or reference viruses and total infectious virus titers of the double mutant was severely altered over 72 h (Fig. 4B). This trend was exacerbated in primary mixed murine CNS cultures, which showed no detection of infectious rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A compared to single mutant PBM and reference viruses (Fig. 4C). As no differences were observed between both single PBM mutant (rOC/E-PBMD82A and rOC/E-PBMV84A) and reference virus, we continued the characterization of the potential PBM only with the double mutant virus (rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that cells could be infected by all viruses but we detected a significant difference in propagation for both LA-N-5 cells (Fig. 4D, Figure S2A) and primary mixed murine CNS cultures (Figure S2B), showing a significantly reduced propagation for the double PBM mutant rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A.",

Using a RT-qPCR approach, the quantity of total viral particles in stocks of rOC/ATCC, rOC/Estop, rOC/E-TMQ17A or rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A were evaluated and compared to the infectious titer of the corresponding viruses (\nFig. 5A). Whereas the reference virus possesses a ratio of infectious virion to total viral particles of approximately 1:100, the rOC/Estop mutant has a ratio of 1:56 000 correlating with the default in infectious virion production previously observed. Surprisingly, the quantity of total viral particles (evaluated as total RNA copy number by RT-qPCR) was close to the reference virus. The same defect was observed for rOC/E-TMQ17A but to a lesser extent with a ratio of 1:1065, but it was absent for the rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A mutant. Indeed, even though this latter mutant produces less virions compared to the reference virus, a very high proportion of them are infectious, as the ratio of infectious over total particles is about 1:2 (Fig. 5A). These observations of modified ratio were confirmed by immunofluorescence comparing the percentage of infected cells when the quantity of virus used for the infection of LA-N-5 cells was normalized either to the number of infectious virions or to the number of total viral particles (Fig. 5B). All these findings demonstrate that the HCoV-OC43 E protein is critical for efficient replication in epithelial and neuronal cells, and that its functional domains play important and potentially distinct roles during the production of new infectious virions.",

Infection of 22-day-old C57Bl/6 mice with reference and E protein mutants revealed that the infectious titer in the brain (\nFig. 7A) and the spinal cord (Fig. 7B) was significantly reduced for the TMD mutant. This altered replication in the brain correlates with an extremely weak production in the spinal cord, where infectious virions were detected in only one mouse at 5 dpi. Production of infectious particles was under the limit of detection in mice infected with the PBM mutant, correlating with the total absence of neurovirulence (Fig. 6). However, the PBM mutant RNA was detected in the brain at 5 and 9 dpi, although at a lower level than the reference virus or the TMD mutant (Fig. 7C), indicating that this virus was capable of replicating at a low level in the brain. Similar observations were obtained following mouse infection with rOC/Estop (Fig. S3D). Viral RNA of each mutant was extracted at 5 and 9 dpi and sequenced for the E and M gene. No reversion in the targeted genes were observed (data not shown), indicating that the inserted mutations are stable during replication in the murine brain for at least 9 days. It is interesting to note than when infected with a higher viral dose (102.5 TCID50/10 \u00b5L vs 101.5 TCID50/10 \u00b5L), infectious virions of the PBM mutant could be detected in low amount in the brain of mice (Figure S4A). Our system only allows to detect infectious titer over 102.5. Thus, the apparent (but very low) increase of infectious virus production observed at 10\u201311 days post-infection may be explained by the fact that the PBM mutant replicates at very low level between 3 and 11 days pi and that, by doing this, this mutant could be able to avoid detection by the immune system and delay its clearance from the CNS. Viral RNA was also detected in both the brain and spinal cord (Figure S4B and C). Sequencing of the E and M genes again revealed the absence of reversion, again suggesting that the absence of detectable infectious virion production previously observed (Fig. 7) was probably due to the low infectious dose. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a fully competent E protein (with both functional TMD and PBM) is essential for HCoV-OC43 neurovirulence in association with efficient replication in the CNS, correlating with the early observations in neuronal cells (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4).",

However, this production was significantly lowered compared to reference virus. Therefore, based on data obtained in neuronal cultures (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4), we investigated if the TMD mutation also induced a defect in propagation within the brain. Brains of mice infected intracerebrally with rOC/ATCC or rOC/E-TMQ17A were harvested at 3 and 7 dpi, and viral spreading was observed by immunofluorescence. Whereas the reference virus had already infected the hippocampus at 3 days post-infection (with positive cells around the lateral ventricle and in the hypothalamus), and then continued to spread until the rest of the brain was infected at 7 dpi (\nFig. 8 left panels), the rOC/E-TMQ17A presented an important delay in spreading as only a few number of infected cells were visible at 3 dpi except for a small focus of infection around the hippocampus and the lateral ventricle. Spreading then occurred to the same brain regions compared to reference virus but to a much lower extent (Fig. 8 right panels). This suggests that although the TMD mutant seems to follow the same spreading path in the murine brain, its spreading is greatly delayed and underlines the fact that HCoV-OC43 E protein TMD is important for efficient propagation in the murine brain.",

Indeed, whereas murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV are attenuated, showing a reduced ability to produce infectious virus without E protein, in a cell-type specific manner (DeDiego et al., 2008, DeDiego et al., 2007, Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015, Kuo and Masters, 2003), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Ortego et al., 2002) and MERS-CoV (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013) are replication competent, but completely propagation defective, with no detectable infectious virus production when the E protein is deleted. Similarly, we were able to rescue infectious rOC/Estop production by providing wild-type E protein in trans, as the recovery of initially complemented rOC/Estop through complementation, and amplification on epithelial cells yielded detectable infectious virus (Fig. 1). As suggested for MERS-CoV (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013), the apparent low titer detected after the first passage on HRT-18 cells (especially at P1), could be due to a transfer of detached cells transfected with the initially complemented pBAC-OC43-E-Stop. Furthermore, the production of infectious particles (for initially complemented mutant lacking the E protein) was low and decreased with subsequent amplification attempts. On the other hand, these results also suggest that production of infectious virions without E protein is possible but with severely affected efficiency, underlining the requirement of a fully functional E protein. Coronavirus E protein has been suggested to allow correct virion formation in part by inhibiting M protein aggregation (Kuo et al., 2007), or by inducing scission events at the ERGIC (Fischer et al., 1998). Our data indicate that while reducing dramatically the quantity of infectious viral particles formed, the complete abrogation of HCoV-OC43 E protein did not significantly alter the quantity of total viral particles produced compared to the reference virus (Fig. 5), suggesting that the protein is important for efficient virion maturation that lead to good infectivity.",

Indeed, the appearance of revertants with different E sequences after only a few rounds of amplification on HRT-18 cells indicates that low level of viral particles must have been produced earlier during the process as we already observed previously for HE-deleted recombinant HCoV-OC43 (Desforges et al., 2013). We observed strong selective pressure at the position where we introduced a stop codon where nucleotide changes led to reversion to reference E sequence or to another amino acid residue (tryptophan or leucine). It was previously described that SARS-CoV (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015) and MHV (Kuo and Masters, 2010) E protein deletion mutants underwent compensatory mutations after a few passages in culture to utilize a partially duplicated version of the adjacent M protein to recover partial virus production. A second type of reversion was observed for SARS-CoV E protein deletion mutant after an intranasal infection of susceptible mice as the small transmembrane ion channel forming 8a was modified to incorporate a potential PBM associated with increased infectious virus production compared to E protein deletion mutant (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015). Our results support the hypothesis that there is selective pressure to specifically restore the E protein functionality itself without partial duplication of the M gene (data not shown), however, it is important to note that we only introduced a stop codon at the beginning of the E gene instead of deleting part or all of the gene, as it was done for SARS-CoV and MHV (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015, Kuo and Masters, 2010). A recombinant HCoV-OC43 in which the E gene would have been deleted could have used the same reversion process in other viral gene.",

            "text": "The coronavirus E protein is now considered as a virulence factor (reviewed extensively in (DeDiego et al., 2014)) and there have been extensive efforts to characterize the different domains of this relatively small transmembrane protein and the possibility that it acts as a viroporin, with ion channel activity. The TMD of several coronavirus E proteins (including HCoV-OC43) was predicted (Torres et al., 2005) and shown to form ion channels permeable to small cations in artificial membranes for species such as IBV, MHV, HCoV-229E (Wilson et al., 2006), MERS-CoV (Surya et al., 2015) and SARS-CoV (Wilson et al., 2004). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the IBV E protein can exist in a penta-oligomeric state (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015), and that for MERS-CoV (Surya et al., 2015) and SARS-CoV (Pervushin et al., 2009, Torres et al., 2006, Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2013, Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2012), it forms pentameric channels in lipid membranes. Chemical inhibition of ion channel activity (Wilson et al., 2006), destruction of the integrity of (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2014, Regla-Nava et al., 2015, Ye and Hogue, 2007) or replacement of the TMD with those of other viral species (Ruch and Machamer, 2011) all led to reduced viral titers for other coronaviruses species. The E protein of coronaviruses is largely localized within the secretory pathway (Cohen et al., 2011, Nieto-Torres et al., 2011, Venkatagopalan et al., 2015) where it has recently been described for IBV to exist in two different pools; one of monomeric E proteins that disrupt the secretory pathway and a second pool in an oligomeric state, likely serving to facilitate the assembly of progeny virions (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015). The transient delay in infectious virus release observed for the TMD mutant compared to the reference virus (Fig. 3) suggests a defect in virus release that could be the result of damaged infectious particles as it was observed for IBV, for which a TMD mutant of the E protein induces a similar defect associated with increased quantity of non-infectious viral particles released possessing a cleaved S protein near the virion surface (Ruch and Machamer, 2011). Considering the higher proportion of non-infectious virions released by cells infected with the TMD mutant compared to cells infected with the reference virus (Figs. 3D and 5A), a similar process consisting in an alteration of infectious virions in the secretory pathway may also be involved here, suggesting an important role for TMD within the cellular secretory pathway. Furthermore, mutation at homologous position T16 of IBV did not have an effect on VLP formation but rather was required for secretory pathway disruption (Ruch and Machamer, 2012, Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015). These results suggest that mutation Q17A (homologous to IBV T16A) in the HCoV-OC43 E protein putative TMD plays a role in modulating infectious virus release from infected cells.",

            "text": "A four-amino acid C-terminal PBM protein-protein interaction motif has been predicted for HCoV-OC43 (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014). Through the replacement of the key amino acids of this motif by alanines, we demonstrated its importance in infectious virion production in the epithelial and neuronal cells tested (Fig. 4). Defective propagation without an effect on the ability to infect cells was observed with the recombinant virus with an abrogated putative PBM. Deletion of the PBM in SARS-CoV E protein led to slight decreases in viral titers in some cell types (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014) while in others viral titers remained unaffected (Regla-Nava et al., 2015). Our data on HCoV-OC43 reveal significant infectious virus production defects in an epithelial cell line which was further accentuated in neurons, but only after infection by the double mutant rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A, suggesting that HCoV-OC43 replication in cultured cells can tolerate a slight flexibility in the putative PBM sequence. Among coronavirus E proteins, only the SARS-CoV E protein has been shown to per se possess such a functional motif, which interacts with PALS1 to disturb secretory pathway membranes to alter tight junction formation (Teoh et al., 2010) and syntenin to play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response typical of infection via p38 MAPK activation (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014). For SARS-CoV E protein, the PBM is suggested to be important in two independent functions: virus stability and virulence/pathogenesis rather than virus production (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015, Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014, Regla-Nava et al., 2015). Given that the functions of PBM is dependent on their sequence and surrounding sequence context (Ye and Zhang, 2013), further study of the HCoV-OC43 E protein neuronal interactome is warranted and could provide new insights on the precise function of the protein in infected cells. Prevention of a functional interaction between HCoV-OC43 E protein PBM and its PDZ domain-containing ligand could conceivably function in the same vein as seen in case of neurotropic encephalitic rabies virus, for which differences in disease phenotype, rapid versus attenuated spread of virus infection, was attributed to differences in PBM sequences on the C-terminal of the rabies envelope glycoprotein G leading to different cellular interaction partners to mediate either neuronal cell survival or death (Pr\u00e9haud et al., 2010). Surprisingly, the PBM mutant forms less total viral particles but almost all of them are infectious. As protein-protein interaction motifs, viral PBM are involved in a variety of processes, including viral particle assembly and maturation (Javier and Rice, 2011). Abrogation of the E PBM, could prevent critical cellular and/or viral interaction necessary for the rapid and efficient formation and maturation of viral particles, making propagation highly inefficient.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV E protein is critical for neuroinvasiveness in susceptible mice (DeDiego et al., 2008). HCoV-OC43 E protein seems to differ from its SARS-CoV homolog as viral RNA is present in the brain of all mice intranasally infected with either the reference virus, the TMD mutant or the PBM mutant (Fig. 6-A), indicating that the fully functional protein is not essential for neuroinvasion. On the other hand, the amount of viral RNA was significantly lower in the brain of E mutant-infected mice. Although we cannot rule out that these data represent a difference in replication and propagation once the virus is already in the brain, optimal HCoV-OC43 neuroinvasion may necessitate a fully functional E protein. The SARS-CoV E protein was recently described as an important virulence factor during infection of the lungs, being in part responsible for the immune response exacerbation (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014), the lung epithelium destruction (Teoh et al., 2010), and edema accumulation in the lungs (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). We demonstrate here that HCoV-OC43 E protein deletion as well as abrogation of the putative PBM prevented neurological symptoms following CNS infection, correlating with replication and propagation observations in epithelial and neuronal cells (Fig. 6). Disappearance of respiratory tract disease was observed for SARS-CoV in which E PBM was abrogated, preventing interaction of the viral protein with the PDZ-containing protein syntenin (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014, Regla-Nava et al., 2015). The absence of neurological symptoms following infection by either rOC/Estop or rOC/E-PBMD82A-V84A could potentially be linked to glutamate excitotoxicity that we have previously observed in mice (Brison et al., 2011), possibly by interfering with PDZ-domain containing proteins found in neuronal cells (Feng and Zhang, 2009). We also demonstrate that HCoV-OC43 putative TMD plays a role in the neuropathogenesis following the CNS infection, albeit to a lesser extent than its PBM. Indeed, infected mice showed some neurological symptoms, even if their severity and frequency were lower than for the reference virus. This attenuated phenotype was also associated with reduced viral particles production and propagation in the CNS. Homologous mutation at the position 15 of SARS-CoV E protein also led to an attenuated pathology, although infectious viral particle production was not significantly affected compared to wild-type virus (Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HCoV-OC43 E protein is a virulence factor, with TMD and PBM being important determinants in that matter.",

            "text": "In summary, the current study demonstrates the critical importance of a fully functional HCoV-OC43 E protein in infectious virus production and efficient spread in both epithelial and neuronal cells. Modifications to key amino acids in putative functionally important domains modulated infectious virion production and delayed virus spread in human and murine neuronal cells and within mouse CNS. This points towards the presence of a true TMD, which has a role in the secretory pathway, as seen for other coronaviruses and that the HCoV-OC43 E protein putative C-terminal PBM plays a significant role in infectious virion production as well as efficient virus spread. In addition, this study establishes a clear link between both putative functional domains of HCoV-OC43 E protein and CNS pathogenesis. Functional viroporins and viral PBM are associated with viral pathogenesis for a growing number of viruses and their studies to better understand virus-host interaction represent an emerging field (Javier and Rice, 2011, Nieva et al., 2012, Scott and Griffin, 2015). Considering that the HCoV-OC43 E protein seems to possess both functions and that they seem to be important for the induction of disease, future studies regarding their functionality and underlying mechanisms resulting in HCoV-OC43 neuropathogenesis previously described (Brison et al., 2011, Jacomy et al., 2006, Le Coupanec et al., 2015) are warranted and necessary as they will help to identify virus-host interfaces which could represent therapeutic target.",
