Cats, tigers, cheetahs and other wild felines are susceptible, kittens aged 6 to 84 days are mainly infected, with a mortality rate of 67% [1,2]. After FCV infection, the animals have oral ulcers, chronic stomatitis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and pneumonia. FCV is distributed worldwide and is highly contagious in felines. Once the kittens are infected, FCV proliferates in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract, causing feline upper respiratory tract disease (FURTD) [3]. The clinical symptoms are relieved 14 to 18 days after the infection, but the FCV is still excreted through saliva and nasal secretions, which is the main reason for the substantial spread of FCV [3].",

In past studies, equine IgG was gradually favored by researchers as a blood-derived biological product that is easy to obtain in large quantities and has a low cost. Antibodies, particularly F(ab')2 fragments, are easy to purify in large quantities and are inexpensive and have been reported to prevent Rabies Virus (RV) and West Nile virus (WNV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola Virus (EBOV) [[10], [11], [12], [13]].",

Thereafter, the F(ab')2 fragments were produced from the IgG digested by pepsin to avoid potential allergic reactions between different species of animals. We evaluated the protective effects of equine IgG (in vitro) and F(ab')2 fragments (in vitro and in vivo) on FCV. First, we determined the neutralization titer of the IgG. Then, the neutralizing activity of the F(ab')2 fragments was confirmed by Indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization assays. Furthermore, infected cats treated with purified F(ab')2 fragments showed a significantly reduced viral load and FCV shedding in the trachea and lungs. This lowers the score of clinical symptoms and reduces mortality in cats. Immunohistochemical staining also confirmed that F(ab')2 reduced FCV in tissues. These results suggest that equine neutralizing F(ab')2 fragments may protect cats against FCV pathogenic infection.",

Antibodies prepared from horse sera have the advantages of low cost and process maturation and can produce specific antibodies against multiple antigenic determinants. The removal of Fc fragments from IgG is significant in alleviating allergic reactions in animals, making antibodies safer for cats [17]. More importantly, polyclonal F(ab')2 fragments recognize and bind to multiple antigenic determinants of FCV, which may avoid potential antibody escape. Moreover, the F(ab')2 molecular weight is between those of the IgG and Fab fragments. High-molecular-weight IgG has difficulty entering into tissues through blood vessels, which results in delays of antigens neutralizing tissues [18]. Although low-molecular-weight Fab can diffuse into the tissue more easily through the blood vessels, the effect of neutralizing the antigen by the rapid removal via filtration of the kidney is impaired. Second, the half-life of Fab in vivo is less than that of F(ab')2, which results in F(ab')2 being superior to Fab under the same dosage and time [19].",
