It is a condition in which malabsorption occurs in absence of an identified specific etiology primarily in the tropical regions of the world [6, 7\u2022] . TS is diagnosed based on the following criteria: (a) compatible clinical presentation, (b) demonstration of malabsorption of two unrelated substances, (c) abnormal smallintestinal mucosal histology, which may be patchy, (d) exclusion of other specific causes for MAS (except small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth [SIBO]), and (e) persistent response to treatment with antibiotics such as tetracycline and folic acid [2\u2022] . Compatible clinical presentation is very important as abnormal small-bowel mucosal histology has been reported in tropics even in asymptomatic subjects, a condition called as tropical enteropathy [8] . Tropical enteropathy, however, is not same as TS ( Table 1) .",

In fact, epidemics of chronic diarrhea and MAS following acute infective gastroenteritis (referred to as \"postinfectious tropical malabsorption\") were reported from India [12\u2022] . In a study from four villages from southern India in 1968, 8-20 % villagers, suffering from an attack of acute infective diarrhea continued to experience liquidity and frequency of stool who were diagnosed to have TS [1\u2022\u2022] . Several other studies reported epidemics of diarrhea with features suggestive of TS in India [13] [14] [15] [16] . The Madras State health reports recorded five epidemics of chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology that clinically resembled TS between 1930 and 1942 [17] . Epidemics of TS also occurred among soldiers and prisoners of war in the Indo-Burma region during the Second World War, in American military personnel serving in the Philippines and in Bangladesh [6, 7\u2022, 18] . A similar condition was also reported sporadically from temperate countries where it was named \"temperate sprue\" [19] .",

There is, however, hardly any evidence in favor of this hypothesis; in contrast, there has been several studies reported recently that contradict this hypothesis. In a recent study on 275 patients with sporadic MAS from Lucknow, India, 101 (37 %) had TS, which was the single commonest cause of MAS [5\u2022\u2022] . In another study from a large teaching hospital in New Delhi, India, though celiac disease was the single commonest cause of MAS (62 %), 22 % had TS [3] . In a study reported from a hospital in Vellore, located in the southern region of India, 36 (29 %) of 124 adult patients with sporadic MAS had TS, which was the single commonest cause in this population [4] . In an earlier study from Lucknow, India, 39/99 (39 %) patients with MAS were diagnosed having TS using very rigorous criteria [2\u2022] . All these studies clearly contradict the belief that sporadic form of TS has disappeared currently. In fact, most reports have suggested that the sporadic form of TS is frequently seen in India even today [20\u2022] . Patients with TS have also been reported sporadically even recently from other parts of the world. Two American subjects living in Thailand and Vietnam were reported to have TS in 2013 [21] . Two other cases who developed TS after returning from Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Peru were reported in 2010 from the USA [22] .",

            "text": "However, epidemics of TS have not been reported recently. This argument has been used to support the hypothesis that frequency of TS has reduced currently. An important issue to be reviewed here relates to a recently described entity called postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) [23\u2022] . In this condition, following an episode of acute gastrointestinal infection associated with at least two of the followings (a) diarrhea, (b) vomiting, (c) fever, and (d) isolation of enteropathogen on stool culture, patients develops IBS for the first time [23\u2022] . Most patients with PI-IBS have diarrhea-predominant disease [23\u2022] . Initial studies on PI-IBS were reported from Sheffield, UK [24] [25] [26] [27] . Subsequently, several studies have been reported from other temperate countries in the world such as Canada, North America, South Korea, and China [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Would this condition, in which stool continued to remain frequent and liquid after an episode of acute gastroenteritis, be called as temperate sprue if described five decades ago? The answer to this question would be affirmative if the patients were found to have biochemical evidence of mucosal malabsorption on D-xylose test, fecal fat estimation, and abnormal small-intestinal histology. However, in no study that described PI-IBS, tests for mucosal malabsorption and small-intestinal mucosal histology were reported. Hence, it is difficult to say whether a proportion of these patients with socalled PI-IBS could have suffered from postinfectious tropical malabsorption or TS. Obviously, this form of postinfectious tropical malabsorption is similar to epidemic form of TS.",

Briefly, 7-31 % patients with acute gastroenteritis have been reported to develop PI-IBS, a frequency quite similar (8-20 %) to that reported for postinfectious tropical malabsorption, whereas the latter condition was reported about five to six decades ago, interest in the former condition emerged primarily during last two decades [7\u2022, 33] . Both the conditions have similar pathogenesis and treatment ( Table 2) . Though several studies on PI-IBS have been reported from temperate countries recently, not a single study on this condition has been reported recently in the areas of the world where epidemic of TS was reported [23\u2022, 34] . Unfortunately, not a single study reported till date on PI-IBS performed tests for mucosal malabsorption and small-intestinal biopsy to exclude that these patients were suffering from PI-IBS and not postinfectious tropical malabsorption. In fact, a few studies reported abnormal smallintestinal permeability (SIP) in patients with diarrheapredominant IBS (IBS-D) with or without SIBO [35, 36] , some of whom might have PI-IBS; in fact, abnormal SIP might suggest presence of mucosal malabsorption; and abnormal SIP is well known in patients with TS [37\u2022\u2022] . Therefore, based on the above evidence, it is logical to believe that a disorder somewhat similar to that described from southern We believe that following an acute gastroenteritis, though some patients recover completely, others may continue to have bowel dysfunction, which may be due to postinfectious tropical malabsorption or due to PI-IBS ( Fig. 1 ). Tests for mucosal malabsorption and small-intestinal histology are essential to differentiate between these two conditions. Hence, we suggest that in the future iteration of Rome criteria for diagnosis of PI-IBS, it is important to consider this issue and modify the criteria for diagnosis of PI-IBS as suggested in Table 3 .",

These factors include, gut dysbiosis including small-intestinal bacterial colonization and overgrowth, dysregulated host's immune response leading to protracted inflammation, reduced gut defense, abnormal SIP, villous atrophy, mucosal disaccharidase deficiency including that of lactase, bile acid de-conjugation, neuro-hormonal dysregulation, exaggerated fat-induced ileal brake leading to slow mouth-to-cecum transit promoting bacterial colonization, deficiency of vitamin B 12 and folate causing megaloblastosis of small-intestinal epitheliums, and colonic dysfunction leading to reduced colonic water Bacterial colonization (10/13, 77 % vs. 3/12, 25 %, respectively) and overgrowth (4/13, 31 % vs. 0/12, 0 %, respectively) were commoner in patients with TS than controls as demonstrated in an earlier study [39\u2022\u2022] . Bacteria in the small intestine alters enterocyte brush-border motility [42] , deconjugate bile acids preventing its enterohepatic circulation [43] . As de-conjugated bile acids cannot form chylomicrons, fatty acid absorption is impaired causing steatorrhea [44] . Deconjugated bile acids also directly inhibit carbohydrate transporters, reduce intraluminal pH, and further damage intestinal enterocytes creating a self-perpetuating cycle [42] . Bacteria produce other metabolites such as acetate and formate [44] , which may affect intestinal function. Bacterial colonization and overgrowth cause alteration of duodenal morphology, namely, villous atrophy and an increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytes, which return to normal on antibiotic treatment [39\u2022\u2022] . In TS, many different bacteria have been isolated including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloace, and patients can harbor one or more highly toxigenic strains [45] .",

Similar findings have been shown in tropical areas such as in Calcutta (currently renamed Kolkata) in association with acute gastroenteritis due to E. coli, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, or a variety of nonspecific enteric bacteria [48] . Moreover, bacterial contamination in the jejunum was found to persist in these patients up to 4 months after the original infection [48] . One study reported reduced secretion of gastric acid in patients with TS, though salivary IgA was normal [49] . In another study, a proportion of patients with TS were found to have hypogammaglobulinemia [50] . Obviously, these factors would result into reduced innate immunity of gut causing bacterial colonization and overgrowth in the small bowel in the presence of inadequate food hygiene, which is not uncommon in areas of the world where TS has been reported. Zinc supplementation is known to improve gut defense and improve SIP. Zinc supplementation reduced the severity and duration of diarrhea in infants and young children, in an earlier study from India [51] . But, there is no study of zinc in relation to TS. In a report on a single patient with TS developing following journey to Sri Lanka, low level of zinc was detected [52] . However, more studies using sophisticated immunological techniques may uncover many other aspects of reduced gut defense in patients with TS.",

SIP is abnormal in several diseases associated with altered small-intestinal functions such as IBS-D, PI-IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Postdysenteric gut dysfunction might result from persistent low-grade inflammation in enteric submucosal and neuromuscular compartments, as shown from studies in animals and human [63] . In patients with IBS-D and PI-IBS, increase in permeability could promote neuromuscular inflammation that disturbs enteric sensation and motility. Abnormal SIP has been reported in patients with TS. A study on estimation of SIP using urinary excretion of lactulose and mannitol by 1H-NMR spectroscopy on a small number of patients with MAS (n=18), including eight patients with TS and healthy controls (n=28), showed that the urinary excretion ratio of lactulose to mannitol was higher in patients with MAS as compared to healthy controls [64] . Also, urinary excretion of lactulose was higher in patients with TS but excretion of mannitol was the same as compared with healthy controls [64] . Another study on SIP using urinary excretion of lactulose and L-rhamnose showed that urinary excretion of lactulose was higher in TS patients as compared with healthy controls [65] . The magnitude of the absorption defects demonstrated in patients with TS was more severe than would be anticipated from the jejunal mucosal abnormalities [65] . In another study, abnormal SIP among patients with TS persisted in spite of treatment in a proportion of patients; [37\u2022\u2022] those with persistently abnormal SIP continued to pass more frequent stool and gained less weight than those in whom it got normalized [37\u2022\u2022] .",

Small-bowel stasis in patients with TS may result from exaggerated ileal brake induced by malabsorbed fat passing through the ileum, which liberate gut hormones like peptide YY, neurotensin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (Fig. 2) [39\u2022\u2022, 66\u2022\u2022]. Gut hormones play a major role in intestinal motility. Hormones such as enteroglucagon, peptide YY, and neurotensin slow transit while motilin enhances the rate of gastric emptying and hastens small-intestinal motility [67, 68] . In an earlier study, patients with TS had raised basal plasma motilin and enteroglucagon concentrations, but their postprandial release of both gastric inhibitory polypeptide and insulin was significantly reduced [69] . In two earlier studies, orocaecal transit time (OCTT) was found to be longer in patients with TS than in controls [ [70] . In a recent study, infusion of fat into the proximal small intestine was shown to inhibit antroduodenal motility, delay duodeno-cecal transit time, and increase plasma levels of peptide YY and neurotensin than among controls [66\u2022\u2022] . Though the same mechanism of fatinduced ileal brake may operate in patients with MAS and steatorrhoea due to any cause, such as celiac disease and chronic pancreatitis, it has been studied only in patients with TS [66\u2022\u2022].",

Vegetarians are at risk for vitamin B 12 deficiency due to suboptimal intake [75] . A large proportion of Indian subjects are vegetarian, which may predispose to the deficiency of vitamin B 12 . Moreover, SIBO may predispose to vitamin B 12 deficiency as occurring in blind loop syndrome [76] . Although vitamin B 12 absorption is frequently improved by antibiotics, it may not return to normal levels despite prolonged therapy [77] . There may be, therefore, a coexistent mucosal lesion as previously described in E. coli-contaminated rats and small-intestinal diverticulosis in man [78, 79] . In a previous study on 38 patients with vitamin B 12 malabsorption, antibiotic therapy resulted in a rapid return of vitamin B 12 absorption to normal in 50 % of the patients [12\u2022] . In another study, vitamin B 12 absorption returned to normal and there was a marked decrease in total luminal flora in all three subjects who were treated with tetracycline [79] . Furthermore, there was some correlation between the bacteriological findings in both the jejunum and ileum and vitamin B 12 malabsorption [80] . In the jejunal aspirates of patients with vitamin B 12 malabsorption, the mean log counts of aerobic flora, total flora, and bacteroides were greater than the counts in the controls and in the ileal aspirates, all except one of the patients with vitamin B 12 malabsorption had bacteria present in counts greater than 10 4 colony forming units/milliliter (CFU/mL) [80] . Whereas in those with normal vitamin B 12 absorption, only one fourth had bacterial growth and none had more than 10 3 CFU/mL [80] . This might suggest that bacteria to produce toxins altering small-intestinal physiology. Such a mechanism has been postulated for E. coli in a case of diverticulosis [79] . However, further studies to examine the nature of the cellular lesion responsible for the vitamin B 12 absorptive defect in TS and the possible role of bacteria in its pathogenesis are required. Empirical antibiotic treatment has been shown to improve diarrhea and associated malnutrition in most patients with TS [77, 81] . Most studies have been done with tetracycline and sulfonamides [81, 82] . It has been shown that folate and vitamin B 12 absorption improves markedly and symptoms resolve early with antibiotics [83] . Treatment with folic acid alone can be curative early in the course of the disease [84] . It has been proposed that antibiotics reduce the overall bacterial load in the gut leading to reduced inflammation and thus improving diarrhea [85] . Prolonged treatment with tetracycline may be required for complete resolution of symptoms. Tetracycline is generally given for 2 months. In a recent study, rifaximin was tried in treatment of TS without encouraging result [86] . More studies, however, are needed on this issue.",

Antibiotics and vitamins may not completely cure steatorrhea. Cause of steatorrhea is multifactorial-mucosal malabsorption of fat, bacteria-splitting bile acids, and impaired enterohepatic recirculation of bile salts [89] . Restriction of long-chain fatty acids may help in reducing steatorrhea. It should be replaced by medium-chain triglycerides. Coconut oil, which is rich in mediumchain fatty acids, may be helpful in reducing diarrhea [90] . Moreover, malabsorbed fat might cause exaggerated ileal brake reducing gut motility, promoting SIBO and malabsorption in TS [39\u2022\u2022] . Protein and carbohydrate intake should be guided by the weight and body mass index.",

However, in a recent study, we found that younger age (<35 years) and longer duration of diarrhea were more often associated with celiac disease than TS[5\u2022\u2022]. Clubbing of fingers, which may sometimes occur in patients with MAS due to various causes, has rarely been reported in patients with TS[5\u2022\u2022]. The protocol for workup of patients presenting with MAS is outlined inFig. 3.Treatment Treatment of TS involves treating malnutrition, vitamin supplementation, particularly vitamin B 12 and folic acid, and correcting the possible etiology viz. intestinal bacterial colonization and overgrowth. Ideal body weight should be calculated and a diet plan made according to it. A few patients may be too sick and require hospitalization for proper management. Fluid and electrolyte balance should be achieved as early as possible. Vitamins should be supplemented as most of the patients with TS have multiple vitamin deficiencies. In severely malnourished patients, parenteral vitamins may be required. Similarly, minerals like iron, calcium, and magnesium should be supplemented.Other tests for cause of MAS-Anti-endomysial antibody -Barium small bowel series/ CT or MR",
