Briefly, tissue was ground in anhydrous sodium sulfate, sonicated with acetonitrile, and extracted using C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges. Extracts were cleaned up and analyzed using high resolution gas chromatography. Using the distribution data, we converted the concentration of individual chemicals into total tissue TEQ, using the WHO consensus TEF values (Van den Berg et al., 1998), in order to compare with data on the disposition of TCDD (Hurst et al., 2000). In addition, we compared the tissue distribution of individual chemicals in the mixture to the distribution of TCDD. To make the comparison with TCDD, we divided the dose of a given congener determined within fetal or neonatal tissue by the percent dose of TCDD within the tissue. Using these calculations, a congener that deposited within offspring with equal efficiency to TCDD would give a final ratio of 1; less efficient transfer would yield a ratio less than 1; more efficient transfer yields a ratio greater than 1.",

Maternal hepatic EROD was highest at GD 21 and no differences were noted between dams administered TCDD alone or the TEQ mixture across the dose range tested. In contrast by PND 4, hepatic EROD activity in dams administered TCDD alone was significantly greater. For example, at a dose of 1.0 \u03bcg TCDD/kg, activity was 718 \u00b1 19 pmol/min/mg versus 176 \u00b1 18 pmol/min/mg at the equivalent TEQ mixture dose. It appears the TEQ mixture dams have lower fold induction at PND 4 because of a greater decrease in EROD activity from GD 21 levels.

For example, at GD 21 maternal induction with 1.0 \u03bcg TCDD/kg was 33.5-fold versus 29.3-fold with the equivalent dose of the mixture. In contrast, within the same treatment groups, fetal induction was 155.9- and 183.1-fold. One reason for the high fold induction was the low levels of fetal control activity. Due to this low activity the data may be more appropriately evaluated using absolute activity values. Using this criteria, significantly higher EROD was seen at GD 21 in TCDD exposed fetuses at the 0.8 \u03bcg/kg dosage and a nearly 2-fold increase at the 1.0 \u03bcg/kg dose, although this later difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, placental EROD activity was two- to threefold higher in TCDD-exposed tissue although differences were not significant. By PND 4, enzyme activity was substantially higher in offspring. At the 0.8 and 1.0 \u03bcg/kg doses, TCDD induced significantly more EROD activity in the pups than the equivalent TEQ doses of the mixture.",

Furthermore, they reported a 30% decrease in cauda epididymal sperm of PND 63 offspring only at the high dose used; 0.8 \u03bcg/kg TCDD. In contrast, Mably et al.(1992b) reported decreases in cauda epididymal sperm of PND 63 male Holtzman rat offspring at doses as low as 0.064 \u03bcg TCDD/kg, the low dose tested, and as much as a 75% decrease at 1.0 \u03bcg/kg TCDD. In the current study, epididymal sperm counts were a sensitive measure of effect. While the magnitude of response was not as great as those reported by Mably et al.(1992b), significant effects were seen at the lowest dose tested, 0.5 \u03bcg/kg. In contrast, Faqi et al.(1998) reported increased daily sperm production following exposure to 100 \u03bcg PCB77/kg, while 10 \u03bcg PCB126/kg did not affect sperm counts. However, Faqi et al. also reported enlarged testicles following exposure to PCB77, whereas our mixture decreased testicular size at the high dose. It is important to note that PCB 77, unlike persistent PCBs 126 and 169, is rapidly metabolized to reactive intermediates, which may have effects of their own (Pereg et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Pharmacokinetic differences between PHAH congeners exist and are known to influence their relative potency (DeVito and Birnbaum, 1995; DeVito et al., 1998). The decreased degree of responsiveness in EROD induction and developmental reproductive effects using the TEQ mixture suggests either slight conservatism of the TEFs and/or a lower tissue distribution of compounds within the mixture than would be expected with an equivalent dose of TCDD. Using the disposition data from this exposure (Chen et al., 2001), a comparison of the total toxic equivalency within offspring shows the mixture resulted in lower TEQ within the offspring than has been reported for equivalent administered doses of TCDD in our laboratory (Hurst et al., 2000). This was in part due to the limited transfer to the fetus of TCDF, 1-PeCDF, and PCB77 (Chen et al., 2001). TCDF, 1-PeCDF, and PCB77 are readily metabolized by CYP1A1 (Brewster and Birnbaum, 1988; Olson et al., 1994) and the induction of this enzyme by the mixture likely induced the metabolism and excretion of these congeners. However, as these three compounds only contribute approximately 2% of the TEQ in the current mixture their absence in offspring would not account for the decreased responsiveness.",

            "text": "In order to determine which compounds might account for the decreased toxicity relative to TCDD, we compared the disposition of the mixture components to the disposition of TCDD. Based upon their relative masses in the mixture and TEFs, the major contributors to the toxicity of the mixture should be TCDD, PeCDD, 4-PeCDF, and PCB126. Using a mass to mass comparison, TCDD was more readily transferred to fetuses than the other three compounds. In contrast, disposition of PeCDD, PCB126, and PCB169 were relatively similar to TCDD in offspring by PND 4, indicating greater lactational transfer of these three compounds. For example, TCDD concentrations increased in offspring 4- to 6-fold between GD 21 and PND 4, whereas PCBs 126 and 169 increased 13- to 25-fold over this same period. In contrast, 4-PeCDF remained relatively lower in offspring throughout the study period presumably due to the elevated levels in maternal liver. 4-PeCDF is known to be sequestered in liver to a greater extent than TCDD (DeVito et al., 1998). Hepatic sequestration is due to the induction and subsequent binding to CYP1A2 (Diliberto et al., 1999). As stated in Chen et al.(2001), PeCDD, 4-PeCDF, and PCB126 all had a greater percentage of the dose in maternal liver than TCDD. This sequestration in liver likely was a factor in the limited transfer to offspring.",

            "text": "Another important factor in the effects studied is the timing of exposure; i.e., the relationship between tissue concentrations and the critical window for effects. Alterations in the developing ventral prostate have been demonstrated histologically as early as GD 20 (Roman et al., 1998). Similarly, alterations in the vaginal tract preceding vaginal thread formation have been shown to occur during gestation (Dienhart et al., 2000; Hurst et al., 2001). From these observations it would appear that gestational exposure is critical and therefore fetal tissue concentrations would parallel the magnitude of effect. However, Bjerke and Peterson (1994) demonstrated that in addition to in utero exposure, exposure of offspring only by lactational transfer of TCDD was capable of altering the development of the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles. Furthermore, the cumulative impact of in utero and lactational exposure on the development of the prostate was greater than when exposure was restricted to the prenatal period alone. A clearer understanding of the critical window of development is crucial in the interpretation of the correlation between tissue levels and degree to which development is affected.",

            "text": "In conclusion, administered TEQ dose was a reasonable predictor of the reproductive developmental effects studied; the dose of the current mixture affecting most endpoints was within a factor of two of the equivalent TCDD dose. Analysis of the disposition data demonstrates that mixture components were not as readily transferred to offspring as TCDD. These pharmacokinetic differences resulted in lowered tissue TEQ within offspring and likely underlie the decreased toxicity of the mixture. The TEF approach assumes that the mechanism of action involves binding to and activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR; Birnbaum, 1999; Van den Berg et al., 1998). Studies in AhR\u2013/\u2013 mice have shown that the absence of this protein eliminates the developmental toxicity of TCDD (Mimura et al., 1997; Peters et al., 1999). Since the toxicity of the current mixture was reasonably predicted through the use of TEFs, this further supports the hypothesis that the reproductive alterations involve an AhR mediated mechanism.",
