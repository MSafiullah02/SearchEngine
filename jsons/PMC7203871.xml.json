S. suis type 2 (SS2) is the most frequently and virulent isolated from both humans and pigs among all serotypes reported to date [1, 3]. The surface-anchored protein (Sao) is a highly conserved membrane-anchored protein and proved to be a immunogenic vaccine candidate [4]. However, Sao formulated with Emulsigen-Plus\u00ae provides only partial protection to mice against SS2 infection [3]. In our previous study, a recombinant attenuated Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis vaccine strain rSC0016 carrying saoA gene, provided full protection to mice against SS2 challenge [5]. From the above, an effective delivery system such as live Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis play a crucial role to the effectiveness of Sao.",

Curtiss et al. developed the RDAS (Regulated Delayed Attenuated Strategies), which enable live salmonella vaccine effectively colonize lymphoid tissues during the invasion stage because of its wild-type aggressiveness and then be full attenuated by silencing the virulence factor, while stimulate both strong cellular and humoral immunity in the immunized mice [6]. Several ways were used to implement this strategy (RDAS). One way is the reverse synthesis of lipopolysaccharide O-antigen by pmi mutation [7]. Another way is to replace the upstream regulatory and promoter sequences of virulence genes with a tightly regulated araC PBAD activator\u2013promoter [8]. This strategy has been successfully used for S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi [6\u20138]. With this strategy, we construct a regulated delayed S. Choleraesuis vaccine strain rSC0011 with \u0394Pcrp527::TT araC PBADcrp and pmi mutations [9]. rSC0011 delivering S. suis antigens were effective to induce protective immunity against SS2 in mice, but it occasionally caused enteritidis.",

Choleraesuis candidate vector vaccine by using alternative mutation or introducing new mutation to decreasing its potential to induce enteritidis and enhance immunogenicity. Fur is an important regulatory protein in Salmonella. In the presence of iron, Fur acts as a repressor of iron-controlled genes and mounts an adaptive acid tolerance response [8]. Synthesis of Fur in a vaccine strain during growth confers acid tolerance and maintains iron homeostasis. A decrease of Fur synthesis in Salmonella leads to acid sensitivity and iron acquisition [9]. Curtiss et al. reported that a S. Typhimurium strain with an arabinose regulated delayed fur mutation is highly immunogenic [6]. In these consideration, an arabinose regulated delayed fur mutation (\u0394Pfur88:: TT araC PBADfur) was introduced into a S. Choleraesuis vaccine strain with multiple preexist mutations (\u0394pmi-2426 \u0394relA199::araC PBADlacI TT \u0394asdA33) to generate strain rSC0012. A plasmid pS-SaoA [5], encoding saoA from SS2, was transformed into this strain. We evaluated the virulence, immunogenicity and protection against challenge with virulent SS2 or S. Choleraesuis C78\u20133.",

The level of Fur synthesis decreased with arabinose dilution (Fig. 1b). The presence of mutation \u0394relA::araC PBADlacI TT in rSC0012(pS-SaoA) were confirmed by the increased synthesis of SaoA (Fig. 1b) due to the derepression of Ptrc promoter on plasmid in rSC0012, which resulted from reduced LacI production whose production was controlled by arabinose. The pmi gene encodes 6-phosphomannose isomerase that interconverts fructose-6-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphatein in Salmonella [7]. Because mannose is required for O-antigen synthesis, the \u0394pmi mutation enables the strain rSC0012 to display a smooth LPS pattern in nutrient broth in the presence of mannose and a rough pattern in the absence of mannose (Fig. 1c). The \u0394asdA mutation enables the strain rSC0012 to have an obligate requirement for DAP [14], which can be complemented with a vector harboring the asd gene then eliminates the need for antibiotic resistance genes for plasmid maintenance [15]. The growth rates of rSC0012 with DAP, rSC0012(pS-SaoA), and rSC0012(pYA3493) were similar (Fig. 1d). rSC0012 could grow only with DAP (Fig. 1d).",

The results showed that the titers of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 induced in mice immunized with rSC0012, and rSC0011 with either pYA3493 or pS-SaoA were significantly higher than those induced in mice inoculated by strain rSC0018 with either pYA3493 or pS-SaoA at both 7 and 14 days after booster (Fig. 5a, b; *, P < 0.01,**, P < 0.05). Although rSC0011(pS-SaoA) induced a slightly higher level of IFN-\u03b3 in mice than rSC0012(pS-SaoA) did, no significant difference was observed in 3-week-old mice at both 7 and 14 days after booster (Fig. 5a-c). However, rSC0011(pYA3493) elicited a higher level of IFN-\u03b3 than rSC0012(pYA3493) did at 7 days after booster. The titers of IL-4 induced by rSC0012 with either pS-SaoA or pYA3493 in spleen tissues were significantly higher than those induced by rSC0011 with either pS-SaoA or pYA3493 in 3-week-old mice (Fig. 5b; *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01) at 7 and 14 days after booster. Of note, rSC0012(pS-SaoA) induced a dominant Th2 immune response (IFN-\u03b3 < IL-4, IFN/IL-4 < 1) in 3-week-old mice (Fig. 5c); whereas, rSC0011(pS-SaoA) elicited a moderately dominant Th1 immune response (IFN-\u03b3 > IL-4, IFN/IL-4 > 1) in 3-week-old mice (Fig. 5c, *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01). These results indicated the isogenic strain with two different mutations, \u0394Pfur88::TT araC PBADfur or \u0394Pcrp527::TT araC PBADcrp, affected different branches of immune responses. In additional, the titers of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 induced by the three attenuated strains harboring pS-SaoA in immunized mice were higher than those induced by the same strains harboring the emptor vector pYA3493 (Fig. 5a\u2013c; #, P < 0.05, ##, P < 0.01), suggesting that the protein, SaoA, might augment the immune responses in mice.\n",

Achieving that goal will restrict unacceptable reactogenicity to avoid over-excitation of inflammatory responses, but sufficient metabolic activity should be maintained to enable the live vaccine to reach deep lymphatic tissues and induce protective immunity [20]. The development of bacterial vaccine relies on a combination of defined mutations [19, 21]. In order to enhancing the immunogenicity of vaccine strains or to disarm them, multiple independent defined mutations were introduced into Salmonella to generate new recombinant attenuated vaccine strains [6, 19, 22]. By coalescent proper mutations, vaccine strains can be befittingly designed to avoid unacceptable reactogenicity and enhanced immunogenicity [17]. Our previous live attenuated S. Choleraesuis vaccine vector rSC0011 occasionally caused enteritidis in mice [9]. One of the ways to address this problem is by incorporating a sopB mutation [5, 19]. In this paper, another way to improve the S. Choleraesuis vector was reported.",

Once inside Peyer\u2019s patch, it will face macrophagocytes and T cells during the process transferring to deep lymphatic tissues [13]. Fur is essential to Salmonella for accessorial an adaptive acid tolerance response [10]. Although both rSC0011 and rSC0012 had similar levels of Peyer\u2019s patch colonization by oral immunization,we observed that the rSC0012 was cleared more rapidly than the rSC0011 in deeper lymphatic tissues, spleen, and liver of mice. These results suggest that strain rSC0012 was more attenuated than rSC0011 in deep lymphoid tissue, which maybe due to an increase in acid sensitivity cause by loss of Fur makes the cell more susceptible to killing by macrophages.",

In general, the live Salmonella vaccines with RDAS display superior colonization level in lymphoid tissues during the invasion stage, leading to enhanced protection by effectively colonizing lymphoid tissues [6, 25]. However, there are do exist high levels of colonization but low immunogenicity. A strain with the regulated delayed rfc mutation exhibits superior colonization and yet does not stimulate higher heterologous protection than a \u0394rfc strain without RDAS [26]. Thus, in addition to colonization level, other determining factors may exist to induce the enhanced protection achieved by regulated delayed attenuation. From the above, Selecting the proper mutation is critical for vaccine development with RDAS. This study confirmed above statement. Although the colonization of rSC0012(pS-SaoA) in mice was less than that of rSC0011(pS-SaoA), rSC0012(pS-SaoA) stimulated stronger serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses than the rSC0011(pS-SaoA). This phenomenon suggests that strain with regulated delayed fur mutation may stimulate stronger antibody response with fewer bacteria than strain with regulated delayed crp mutation.",

It could partially be that the intracellular characteristics of Salmonella enterica cause them to be detected on the surface of APC through MHC-I molecules. This result is consistent with previous studies with S. Typhi [6]. Strain rSC0012 induced higher Th2 cell-mediated response than strain rSC0011, as aroused by the significant up-regulation of imprint Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and greater humoral responses than rSC0011 in mice. This phenomenon may be related to the secreting of heterologous antigen. The more heterologous antigens were secreted during infection, the more likely to trigger an IL-4-dominant response [27]. We found a larger secretion of the SaoA from rSC0012, which could be presented by MHC-II molecules. An additional factor may be due to an increase in acid sensitivity cause by loss of Fur makes the rSC0012 more susceptible to killing by macrophages, thus weakening rSC0012\u2019s ability to survive in macrophages. The presence of S. suis-specific IgA serves to promptly deliver the antigen to Peyer\u2019s patch dendritic cells or phagocytes and also promptly excite the adaptive immunity during secondary exposure [16]. Generally speaking, the more attenuated the vaccine strain is, the lower its immunogenicity is [17, 22], while, the more attenuated rSC0012 strain induced significantly higher IgA and IgG antibody responses to SaoA than the rSC0011 at 3 weeks after the initial immunization in juvenile mice. This may be the result of a equilibrium between attenuation and the ability to participation immune components and activate a controlled over-inflammatory response by the finely crafted strain [19].",

The asd gene from Salmonella was used as a unique plasmid marker to be used in asd mutants to constitute a balanced-lethal system [14]. LB medium [5],Nutrient broth (NB) and MacConkey agar (Difco) were used for phenotype characterization. When required, media were supplemented with 2,6-diaminopimelic acid (DAP;50 \u03bcg/mL),chloramphenicol (Cm; 25 \u03bcg/mL),L-arabinose (0.2% wt/vol), D-mannose (0.2% wt/vol) or sucrose (5% wt/vol).
