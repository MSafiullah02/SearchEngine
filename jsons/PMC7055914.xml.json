            "text": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. enterica serovar Typhi or S. Typhi) is a human host-restricted pathogen that is the cause of typhoid fever affecting 10.9 million people worldwide annually [1]. Following the ingestion of contaminated food or water, S. Typhi invades the intestinal mucosa and spreads systemically to the liver and spleen, which can result in the acute symptoms of typhoid fever. Depletion of immune cells as known as leukopenia is also a characteristic sign of severe typhoid fever [2\u20136]. In some instances, individuals affected by typhoid fever suffer long-term neurological complications involving motor function deficits [3, 5, 7\u20139]. A secreted soluble protein virulence factor known as typhoid toxin appears to contribute to these clinical signs and symptoms during human infection. When administered to laboratory animals, typhoid toxin recapitulates many of the severe acute-phase symptoms of typhoid fever, such as lethargy, malaise, and stupor (the meaning of typhos in Greek), along with leukopenia and neurologic complications [10, 11]. A majority of typhoid fever patients exhibit high titers of anti-typhoid toxin antibodies in their sera [12\u201315]. Primary human cells and tissues relevant to typhoid clinical signs and symptoms express the specific glycan receptor moieties for typhoid toxin [11], although whether at least some of the glycan receptor moieties are further modified by additional chemical groups has not been revealed.",

CdtB is a nuclease that induces DNA damage, host cell cycle arrest, and cell death [16]. PltA is a mono ADP-ribosyl transferase [17], but its role in pathogenesis remains elusive. One role of PltA is its contribution to the formation of the unique A2B5 configuration of typhoid toxin, by tethering CdtB and PltB together to one toxin complex via disulfide bond and hydrophobic interactions, respectively since there is no direct interaction between CdtB and PltB [10]. PltB recognizes the specific trisaccharide motif as its receptor, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) \u03b12\u20133 or \u03b12\u20136 linked to the underlying disaccharide, galactose (Gal) \u03b21-3/\u03b21\u20134 linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or glucose [10]. Although this motif can be displayed by various types of glycoproteins and glycolipids on cell plasma membranes, PltB preferentially binds to the trisaccharide motif displayed by multiantennary N-linked glycoproteins providing multiple Neu5Acs simultaneously, as opposed to linear N-linked glycans displaying a single Neu5Ac [11].",

The toxin within the SCV is immediately encased in small vesicles and exported to the extracellular environment, without having access to the host cell cytoplasm [18]. The secreted typhoid toxin then recognizes the specific glycan receptor moieties displayed on cell plasma membranes, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis of the toxin into cells, which is an essential process leading to cell intoxication [10]. Typhoid toxin appears to have adapted to glycans predominantly expressed in humans since typhoid toxin does not bind to the otherwise identical glycans terminated by N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) that many mammals including Chimpanzees express as a major form of sialic acids [19]. Typhoid toxin has tropism to cells expressing multiantennary N-linked glycan receptor moieties terminated in the trisaccharide motif sequence, which include immune cells, brain endothelial cells of arterioles, intestinal and gallbladder epithelial cells [11, 20]. The pentameric configuration of the receptor-binding PltB subunit per toxin and the three glycan binding pockets per PltB monomer play an essential role for multivalent interactions between the toxin PltB and glycan receptor moieties [11, 20].",

            "text": "Neu5Ac can be present in a modified form containing additional chemical groups such as acetyl, sulfo, methyl, and/or lactyl groups, with the O-acetylated at C-9 position being the most common modification of Neu5Ac found in human cells, along with the formation of 7,9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac due to the migration of the acetyl group between C-7 and C-9 positions [21, 22]. The O-acetylation of Neu5Ac can also occur at the C-4 position, resulting in Neu4,5Acs [23, 24]. Therefore, at least two different groups of O-acetyl transferases are known to be involved in the O-acetylation of sialic acids. One is acetyl-CoA:sialate 7(9)-O-acetyltransferase (also known as CASD1); the other is acetyl-CoA:sialate 4-O-acetyltransferase [24], although the gene encoding the latter enzyme has not been identified. Moreover, whether human cells encode 4-O-acetyltransferase is elusive [25, 26]. 9-O-acetylated (as well as 4- and 7-O-) and non-modified Neu5Ac naturally occur as part of host cell developmental and/or homeostasis processes, among others [21]. Some viral pathogens including influenza virus C and coronaviruses that use that modified glycan receptor for their entry into host cells have evolved to exploit such chemical modifications of Neu5Ac for their core life cycles [26\u201328]. However, thus far, whether bacterial toxins or virulence factors can use similar tactics for their pathogenesis is unknown. Here we investigated specifically on the role of 9-O-acetyl modification (the most abundant O-acetylated form of sialic acids in humans) of the glycan receptor moieties in the binding and intoxication for Salmonella typhoid toxin.",

            "text": "We first investigated whether host cells relevant to typhoid toxin-mediated clinical signs express both unmodified and 9-O-acetylated glycan receptor moieties. When the toxin is administered systemically into mice, typhoid toxin displays tropism to immune cells and brain endothelial cells of arterioles [11]. This toxin tropism is primarily due to the abundant expression of multiantennary N-linked glycans terminated in the trisaccharide motif (Neu5Ac-Gal-GlcNAc) that typhoid toxin recognizes. This multivalent interaction results in high-affinity bindings as indicated in the glycan microarray results allowing for comparisons of their binding affinities [11]. Epithelial cells of the intestine and the gallbladder also predominantly express multiantennary N-linked glycans [20]. In N-linked glycans, the terminal Neu5Ac can be linked to the underlying Gal-GlcNAc via either \u03b12\u20133 or \u03b12\u20136 [21]. We found that human lymphocytes predominantly express Neu5Ac \u03b12\u20136 linked Gal-GlcNAc (to refer the trisaccharide motif terminated in Neu5Ac, we also use the term \u03b12\u20136 sialosides interchangeably in this manuscript), while human myeloid cells express both \u03b12\u20133 and \u03b12\u20136 sialosides, as assessed by MAL-1 and SNA binding to cell surface membranes, respectively (Fig 1A\u20131D). Human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were obtained from six volunteers for this analysis. We next evaluated 9-O-acetylation of Neu5Ac on cell plasma membranes of human PBLs. Since the porcine torovirus hemagglutinin esterase (PToV-P4 HE) primarily recognizes 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac [25], we exploited PToV-P4 HE that contains an esterase catalytic mutation to assess the expression of 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac on cell plasma membranes and found that 10~30% hPBLs express 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac on their cell surface (Fig 1B and 1E).",

Since cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) null mice exclusively express human-type sialic acid Neu5Ac [19], we used corresponding tissues of CMAH null mice. CMAH is the enzyme responsible for converting Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc in many mammals. However, like CMAH null mice, humans do not express the functional CMAH [29], thus expressing only Neu5Ac. We found that brain endothelial cells of arterioles express a high level of 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, as assessed by the colocalization of typhoid toxin (recognizing all Neu5Ac) and PToV-P4 HE (recognizing 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac) (Fig 2A and 2D). However, unlike immune and brain endothelial cells of arterioles, we did not observe 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac on the epithelial cells of the small intestine or the gallbladder (Fig 2B\u20132D). These results indicate that host cells relevant to leukopenia and neurological complications express glycan receptor moieties containing both unmodified and 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac. Among the 9-O-acetylated glycans, depending on cell types, the linkage between the terminal Neu5Ac and the underlying disaccharide Gal-GlcNAc is \u03b12\u20133 and/or \u03b12\u20136.",

We then carried out surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of these glycans, along with their unmodified counterparts (Fig 3A). We immobilized PltB homopentamer on SPR chips and probed with various concentrations of indicated glycans, to evaluate whether there are any binding affinity differences among them. PltB binds to 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 glycans (Neu5,9Ac2\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) with a ~14-fold increased affinity compared to its unmodified \u03b12\u20133 counterpart (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) (Fig 3B, 3C and 3G), while PltB binds to 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20136 glycans (Neu5,9Ac2\u03b12-6Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) with a slightly higher affinity than its binding to unmodified \u03b12\u20136 counterpart (Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) (Fig 3E, 3F and 3G). It is important to note that the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values for unmodified and 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac\u03b12-3/\u03b12-6Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc present in the context of multiantennary N-linked glycans, which are more relevant to physiological conditions, are likely much higher than the KD values for the core trisaccharide motif that we assessed in this study. Nonetheless, the results presented in Fig 3 indicate that typhoid toxin binds to 9-O-acetylated glycan receptor moieties with increased affinities, compared to its binding to unmodified counterparts. The effect of 9-O-acetyl modification on altering binding affinities is more drastic when the terminal Neu5Ac is linked to the underlying disaccharide Gal-GlcNAc via \u03b12\u20133.",

Similar to PltB pentamer bound to unmodified glycan receptor moieties [20], we did not observe conformational changes of PltB pentamer bound to O-acetylated counterparts, compared to PltB protomer of typhoid holotoxin (S1 Movie). In close-up views of the interface between the PltB binding pockets and the glycans, we found that there are more interactions between PltB and 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 glycans than between PltB and unmodified counterparts. Most notably, the 9-O-acetyl group forms an H-bond with Thr65 (via the main chain of Thr65) in the BS1, which is absent in the interface of the BS1 bound to unmodified \u03b12\u20133 glycans (Fig 4C, 4E and 4F). Likewise, Lys59 and Arg61 form H-bonds with Gal and GlcNAc of the receptor moieties respectively, which are also absent in the interface between PltB and unmodified counterparts (Fig 4E and 4F). Water-mediated interactions in the BS1 via Tyr33, Asp36, and Arg100 to unmodified \u03b12\u20133 glycans were not observed in the BS with 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 glycans, presumably due to the additional three H-bonds on the other side of the binding pocket that make Tyr33, Asp36, and Arg100 out of reach. Overall, the three additional direct interactions between Thr65, Lys59, and Asn61 and all three saccharides of the glycan receptor moieties correlate to the markedly increased binding affinity of PltB to 9-O-Ac \u03b12\u20133 glycans (Fig 4E). In contrast, only the terminal sialic acid Neu5Ac of unmodified glycan receptor moieties directly interacts with residues in the BS1 (Fig 4F). The interfaces of the BS2 with unmodified and 9-O-acetylated glycans were overall comparable, but with the 9-O-acetyl group making a noted accommodation through a hydrophobic interaction with Ile103 residue in the BS2 (Fig 4G and 4H). With regard to the PltB BS3 that has been shown previously to bind to Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc, the 9-O-acetylated glycan counterpart did not bind to the BS3 in either 30 min or 2 hr soaking conditions, respectively (Fig 4A). This appears to be caused by the 9-O-acetyl modification presence in proximity to the steric sensitivity area around Asn29 of the BS3, demonstrated previously by loss of binding of unmodified \u03b12\u20133 sialosides to the BS3 observed in an N29K PltB mutation [20]. Taken together, these results indicate that the markedly increased affinity of PltB to Neu5,9Ac2\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc compared to the affinity of PltB to Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc appears to be due to the increased interactions between the PltB BS1 and 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 glycans.",

O-acetylation of Neu5Ac at C-4 position naturally occurs, although it does not appear to occur in humans. Similar to the results with 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 sialosides, we found that PltB binds to 4-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 glycans (Neu4,5Ac2\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) with a ~11-fold increased affinity compared to its unmodified \u03b12\u20133 counterpart (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) (Fig 3B, 3D and 3G). We also found that 4-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 sialosides bind to PltB homopentamer via the BS1 and 2 (Fig 6A\u20136D). The 4-O-acetyl group forms H-bonds in both BS1 and 2 with Tyr33 (via the main chain) and Thr109, respectively (Fig 6E and 6F). These results indicate that the acetylation position at C-9 itself is not important for the increased binding affinities (Fig 3B, 3C, 3D and 3G). However, it indicates that whether the acetyl group of modified glycan receptor moieties contributes to additional interactions in the binding pockets is important for the binding affinity changes (Figs 3, 4 and 6).",

We generated HEK293 cells that do not express 9-O-acetylated sialosides and counterpart cells that express 9-O-acetylated sialosides, via knocking-out (KO) and overexpressing (OE) the Cas1 domain containing 1 (CASD1) gene, respectively. CASD1 is responsible for the addition of the O-acetyl group to Neu5Ac [30]. 9-O-acetylated sialosides are indeed absent in the CASD1 KO cells, while present in the cell surface of the CASD1 OE cells (Fig 7A). The signal for 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac is specific since the signal was removed when the esterase of PToV-P4 HE was functional (+EST) (Fig 7A bottom left panel). PToV-P4 HE possessing the functional esterase activity is capable of cleaving off the complex of PToV-P4 HE and 9-O-acetylated glycans from host cells. Both CASD1 KO and CASD1 OE cells expressed unmodified Neu5Ac on their cell surface, as detected by typhoid toxin on the non-permeabilized cells (Fig 7A top and middle panels). The specificity of the red signal detected by typhoid toxin was validated by employing a glycan-binding defective mutant of typhoid toxin that contains a S35A point mutation in the PltB subunit [10] (Fig 7A bottom right panel). Up to approximately 80% of 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac on the CASD1 OE plasma membrane was co-stained with typhoid toxin, which is consistent with the capability of typhoid toxin binding to both unmodified and 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (Fig 7B). Using cell cycle profile analysis, allowing for objectively comparing the susceptibility of cells to typhoid toxin, we found that both CASD1 KO and CASD1 OE cells are susceptible to typhoid toxin, but CASD1 KO cells were less susceptible to typhoid toxin than CASD1 OE cells by ~4-fold, as 1.2 pM typhoid toxin-treated CASD1 KO cells in G2/M was comparable to 0.3 pM toxin-treated CASD1 OE cells (S1 Fig and Fig 7C and 7D). These results indicate that typhoid toxin binding to 9-O-acetylated glycan receptor moieties with increased affinities leads to increased intoxication of cells.",

Although the glycan sequence that typhoid toxin recognizes is Neu5Ac-Gal-GlcNAc, typhoid toxin has the highest tropism to cells expressing this glycan motif in the context of multiantennary N-linked glycans, as this interaction results in high-affinity, multivalent bindings. The current study provides important information regarding the capability of typhoid toxin PltB in exploiting the glycan motif with structural differences for virulence. Here we show that typhoid toxin PltB binds to the glycan motif terminated in both unmodified and 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, both of which result in cell intoxication. However, the binding affinity of PltB homopentamer to 9-O-acetylated sialosides is higher than that to their unmodified counterparts, which explains the increased susceptibility of cells expressing 9-O-acetylated sialosides.",

            "text": "One reason why typhoid toxin has evolved to possess flexible glycan receptor usage, as long as the trisaccharide motif is present, may be associated with the dynamic life cycle of S. Typhi. S. Typhi infects both locally in the gastrointestinal tract and systemically in the reticuloendothelial cells, as well as gallbladder epithelial cells over the course of acute and persistent infection. Typhoid toxin is produced exclusively by S. Typhi located within host cells during infection. Multiantennary N-linked glycans terminated in the trisaccharide motif are highly expressed in these cells, as well as in cells associated with typhoid toxin-mediated clinical signs. However, their structural makeup is different depending on cell types which can be further altered by infection as well as part of normal cell developmental/activation processes. Typhoid toxin is suggested to contribute to both typhoid disease progress and the establishment of persistent infection by entering into both uninfected and S. Typhi-infected cells. One fine-tuning mechanism of typhoid toxin in resulting in different virulence between uninfected cells that are associated with clinical signs such as immune cells and brain endothelial cells of arterioles and S. Typhi-infected cells may be associated with the binding affinity difference to structurally different glycan receptor moieties. In support of this postulate, the binding affinity of PltB to \u03b12\u20136 sialosides is higher than that to \u03b12\u20133 sialosides; intriguingly, cells associated with typhoid toxin-mediated clinical signs predominantly express \u03b12\u20136 sialosides and cells associated with infection predominantly express \u03b12\u20133 sialosides.",

            "text": "Typhoid toxin binds to 9-O-acetylated glycans with increased affinities, as compared to the affinities to unmodified counterparts. This effect is greater between unmodified and 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 sialosides. Typhoid toxin binding affinity to 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 sialosides is comparable to its binding affinity to \u03b12\u20136 sialosides. Interestingly, this correlates to the absence or the low expression of 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20133 glycan receptors in epithelial cells and macrophages, cells associated with S. Typhi infection. It is intriguing to speculate that the expression of glycan receptor moieties with relatively lower affinities, in conjunction with the terminally differentiated cell stage in the case of macrophages render cells harboring S. Typhi less susceptible to typhoid toxin intoxication process, as compared to other immune cells and brain endothelial cells of arterioles. Humans have evolved to display a different level of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on the surface of various cells and tissues, presumably for the benefits of host cells, such as fine-tuning of immune responses and cell longevity, among others [23, 31, 32]. In support of this notion, host cells displaying O-acetylated sialic acids are shown to be more resistant against the sialidase activity, indicating the protective role of O-acetyl modification against various pathogens and other cell death stimuli. In line with the observations, longer-lived cells display higher 9-O-acetylation levels than shorter-lived cells (e.g., T cells vs. neutrophils or brain vs. other tissues). In this perspective, it is quite remarkable that bacterial exotoxin secreted by the human-adapted pathogen S. Typhi has evolved to take advantage of the evolution that occurred to humans, which appears to be another example of arms-race between the host and pathogens.",

Overall, this finding, along with other information that we uncover in this study, offers useful insight into the development of competitive inhibitors interfering with the interaction between typhoid toxin and endogenous glycan receptors of cells. Also importantly, this study serves as the first example demonstrating that bacterial pathogens or toxins exploit glycan receptors that are modified by adding chemical groups to fine-tune their intoxication outcomes.",
