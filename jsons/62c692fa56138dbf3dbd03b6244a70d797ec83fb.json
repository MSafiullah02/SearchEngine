Based on the incubation period of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as observational data, the United States CDC has estimated that symptoms of COVID-19 will usually develop within 2-14 days after exposure. Therefore, fourteen days has been the time applied internationally for monitoring and restricting the movement of healthy individuals (quarantine period) (9).",

Findings from virus genome sequencing analysis have pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus (bat CoV) might share the same ancestor, although bats are not for sale in this seafood market (11) . Later cases were reported among health care workers and others without exposure history of wildlife or visiting Wuhan, which indicated human-to-human transmission (10) . Currently, it is considered that the virus can be mainly transmitted through droplets, direct contact and aerosols. Droplets transmission may occur when respiratory droplets, produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, are ingested or inhaled by individuals nearby (within about 6 feet). A subject can also get infected by touching a surface or object contaminated with the virus and subsequently touching his/her mouth, nose, or eyes (12) . Additionally, it has been shown experimentally that the virus can remain viable in aerosols for at least 3 hours (13) , and can be transmitted in closed environments if inhaled into the lungs (12) . Therefore, airborne transmission is a possibility during aerosol generating procedures, e.g., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, etc (14). Although viable virus has been identified in fecal swabs, the fecal-oral route does not appear to be a driver of COVID-19 transmission (11).",

The period of infectivity is often assessed indirectly by detection of viral RNA from respiratory specimens. However, viral RNA does not necessarily confirm the presence of infectious virus. Higher viral loads have been detected soon after symptom onset, suggesting that transmission may be more likely to occur in the earlier stages of infection (15) . The viral shedding duration seems to vary according to the disease severity. It has been found that around 90% of patients with milder symptoms had a negative viral RNA test on nasopharyngeal swabs by day 10 post-onset, while the test remained positive for a longer time in all severe cases (16) . On the other hand, it has been reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that in symptomatic subjects (15) . Indeed, transmission from asymptomatic carriers or individuals within the incubation period has been described (17) . Nevertheless, the extent to which this occurs remains to be determined.",

In T2DM, besides the marked inflammatory process previously discussed, an imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis takes place, with increased levels of clotting factors and relative inhibition of the fibrinolytic system. Both insulin resistance and T2DM are associated with endothelial dysfunction, and enhanced platelet aggregation and activation. These abnormalities favor the development of a hypercoagulable pro-thrombotic state (49) . Additionally, atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are also part of the pathogenesis of other chronic conditions, e.g., hypertension and CVDs (42) . Animal studies involving SARS-CoV reported that older age was related to defects in T-cell and B-cell function and excess inflammation markers. Thus, T2DM alone or in association with older age, hypertension and/or CVDs might contribute to a deficient control of SARS-CoV-2 replication and more prolonged proinflammatory response, potentially leading to poor outcomes (26) .",

ACE2 is widely expressed on the respiratory tract, heart, kidneys, intestines, cerebral neurons, endothelium of arteries and veins, immune cells and pancreas (2) . A Chinese study compared 39 SARS-CoV patients without previous diabetes, who did not receive steroid treatment, with 39 matched healthy siblings and showed that 20 of the 39 SARS-CoV patients developed diabetes during hospitalization. Since immunostaining for ACE2 was strong in the pancreatic islets, it was suggested that SARS-CoV might have damaged islets and caused acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (52) . Therefore, although further evidence is needed, pancreatic damage may also be present in COVID-19 patients, possibly contributing to worse outcomes in subjects with diabetes.",

These medications are postulated to have significant immunomodulatory effects (55) and reduce pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response by decreasing cytokines (53, 54) . They are commonly used by those with diabetes and hypertension (56) , therefore, their impact on the clinical course of COVID-19 has been widely debated. Considering that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and its levels can be increased by ACE inhibitors and ARBs, it has been argued that these drugs might affect negatively the outcome of COVID-19 patients (57) . On the contrary, some have advocated that ACEIs and ARBs might rather be beneficial (58) . SARS-CoV infection and the virus Spike protein reduce ACE2 expression. Mice injected with SARS-CoV Spike presented worsened acute lung failure, which could be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway (59) . Nevertheless, a retrospective analysis performed on 112 patients with COVID-19 and CVD did not show a significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between survivors and non-survivors (60). Similar to ACEIs and ARBs, ibuprofen (61) and thiazolidinediones (62) can also result in increased levels of ACE2, thus generating questions regarding the safety of these drugs in patients with COVID-19.",

According to several studies, the prevalence of diabetes in people infected with the virus is about the same as in the general population, even slightly lower (28, 63) . A meta-analysis of 12 studies describing data from 2,108 Chinese patients with COVID-19 reported a diabetes prevalence of 10.3% (63) , which was similar to the national prevalence of 10.9% reported in 2013 (64) . An Italian study conducted among 146 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at the University Hospital of Padova found an equivalent pattern. The prevalence of diabetes in these patients was 8.9% (mean age 65.3 years), while it was 11.0% among people aged 55-75 years (mean age 65 years) from the same region in 2018 (65) . Although underreporting may be an issue to consider, potential biological mechanisms should not be disregarded. It has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is the primary receptor of MERS-CoV (2). Since DPP-4 inhibitors are commonly applied in the treatment of diabetes worldwide, future research should explore whether DPP-4 may also act as receptor for SARS-CoV-2, thus contributing to a potential protective effect of these drugs against 66) .",

Several clinical trials are in progress to assess the safety and efficacy of potential treatment alternatives, including remdesivir, tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, interferon, chloroquine phosphate, arbidol, among others (68) . One promising pharmacological option of relevance for patients with diabetes is chloroquine and its hydroxy-analogue hydroxychloroquine. Widely used for malaria and autoimmune diseases, chloroquine has also been reported as a potential broadspectrum antiviral drug. Although the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment remain unclear, a recent study showed that the drug was highly effective in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In addition to its immunomodulant and antiinflammatory effect, chloroquine increases endosomal pH and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV, thereby blocking viral infection (69) . Preliminary results from more than 100 patients included in a Chinese clinical trial showed that chloroquine was superior to the control group in shortening the disease course, inhibiting pneumonia exacerbation, promoting a virus negative conversion and radiological improvement without severe side effects (70) . On the other hand, several studies have reported that hydroxychloroquine improves glycemic control in decompensated, treatment-refractory patients with diabetes (71, 72) . It has even been approved to treat T2DM in India as an add-on therapy for patients who do not achieve glycemic targets with two other oral glucose-lowering drugs (73) . Although inflammation is associated with impaired glucose control, the underlying mechanism of hydroxychloroquine's hypoglycemic effect remains unclear (71) . It has been described that chloroquine increases the C peptide response, potentially reflecting an improved pancreatic \u03b2-cell function (72) . Reduced intracellular insulin degradation and increased insulin accumulation have also been identified as possible effects of hydroxychloroquine in animals models (74) . Given the previously reported impact of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on glucose metabolism, caution should be taken when the drug is administered to patients with diabetes and COVID-19. A dose adjustment of the oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin might be necessary in order to prevent potential hypoglycemic events.",

Rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might attenuate worsening of symptoms and adverse outcomes. Although hyperglycemia is usually the main concern in this context, one should not disregard the possibility of hypoglycemic episodes as a result of the interplay between drug treatment, viral pathogenesis and typical metabolic disturbances of diabetes. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies and optimal glucose control goals should be formulated based on disease severity, presence of comorbidities and diabetes-related complications, age and other factors. A multidisciplinary team approach, including infectologists, endocrinologists, pulmonologists, psychologists, nutritionists and exercise rehabilitation specialists may be necessary during the prolonged hospitalization periods and recovery. Special attention should be paid to those with diabetic nephropathy, or diabetes-related heart complications, since they are also at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and death (7, 19) . Finally, increased vigilance and testing in outpatient diabetes clinics for COVID-19, as well as lower thresholds for hospitalization of these patients may have a positive impact on their outcomes.",
