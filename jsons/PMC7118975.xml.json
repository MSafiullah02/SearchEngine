Previous work established the importance of environmental, organisational and individual factors in the adoption of safe work practices amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) but few studies have critically audited the resources available to infection control (IC) and occupational health (OH) services in order to promote safe practice.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 In addition, it is known that communication and \u2018feeling safe\u2019 are important determinants of willingness to provide care in outbreak situations.7 Yet we are aware of no studies to date that have examined how well perceptions of adequacy of safety measures compare with more objective assessments in this regard.",

The senior IC staff completed the second part, an assessment of IC resources in the facility. The third part was an observational audit using a standardised form and was completed by an independent occupational hygienist working as a research assistant on the study. The occupational hygienist performed an observational walk-through audit at each facility after receiving initial training on observational techniques from a pilot hospital site. An infection control practitioner (ICP) accompanied the occupational hygienist through three critical areas in the facility to validate observations: the emergency department (ER), general medicine units (including a respiratory unit if present) and the intensive care unit (ICU). Each walk-through took about three hours to complete using the standardised audit form.",

A total of 1290 HCWs responded to the worker questionnaire, administered at the 16 facilities in the GVR. A total of 80% of the respondents were female. The occupations that responded consisted of: 18% ICU nurses, 19% ER nurses, 36% general medicine nurses, 9% physicians, 9% respiratory therapists and 10% physiotherapists. Questions regarding on-site plans to mitigate against SARS and biological agents received high responses of agreement from staff (i.e. they believe they exist) but scored lower marks from facilities as to their actual existence. The inverse occurred when dealing with staff fit-testing for respirators: facilities unanimously agreed (100% across all sizes of facilities) that workers had been fit-tested but workers themselves did not agree that they had been fit-tested (60.1% of HCWs in small facilities, 72.9% in medium and 78.2% in large facilities responded \u2018yes\u2019 they had been fit-tested).",

This is a concern as the use of protective eyewear is recommended as part of the personal protective equipment that should be donned when providing care to patients with a communicable disease capable of being transmitted by droplets or during procedures where there is a generation of aerosolised droplets. The routine use of eye protection may not have been adopted into the routine practice of HCWs in British Columbia as it has been in Ontario. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, IC directives included the use of eye protection as part of the personal protective equipment to be worn during providing care to a patient with febrile respiratory illness. In British Columbia, use of protective eyewear was recommended but, because only four SARS cases occurred, HCWs may not be aware of the recommendations. As was noted in the Results section, even though other personal protective equipment (gloves, gowns and respirators) are available, there is no indication that there is compliance with their use among HCWs or if they are used correctly. This is an area for further study.",

In contrast, OH services believed that most HCWs requiring fit-testing had completed this task, while HCWs noted that this was far from true. Incomplete baseline OH assessments were noted by OH personnel for the majority of staff, yet HCWs believed that their documentation was complete. HCWs believed that ICPs were not available during lunchtime and that ICOs were not available after hours. These personnel were, in fact, available at these times. Importantly, approximately one-third of HCWs did not know that there were mechanisms to provide feedback to OH services, nor were they clear on availability of IC services after hours.",

There were 251 probable cases of SARS in Canada during the outbreak (247 cases in Ontario, four cases in British Columbia) and 44 deaths (all in Ontario).
