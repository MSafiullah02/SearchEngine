Liang and colleagues in their series of 18 adult cancer patients reported a higher risk of severe illness in contrast to adults without cancer. 3 Patients receiving anticancer treatments can have a higher risk of developing infective complications when compared to healthy people due to their greater level of immunosuppression. Even after cessation of their antineoplastic treatment, immunosuppression is reported to last for several months although its duration is yet to be accurately determined. In addition, it is known that younger children have more persistent immune deficits following chemotherapy, and alterations of the immune system have been reported until 6-12 months following cessation of their antineoplastic treatment. 4, 5 Therefore, many concerns have been raised on the potential risk that the current COVID-19 pandemic would behave in the same way as previous coronaviruses outbreaks when more severe respiratory illnesses and higher rates of hospitalization were registered in immunosuppressed children than in healthy children. 6 By comparison with adults, the number of confirmed COVID-19 children is very low. Moreover, children are generally asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic and their clinical course is shorter than adults. Therefore, children appear to be less susceptible to COVID-19 infection although the reasons are still little known. Hypotheses based on children's vaccines cross reactivity against COVID-19 or on the paucity of angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE2) cell receptors present on the respiratory mucosae of children as protective factors have not been confirmed. 7, 8 We conducted a literature search of the MEDLINE PubMed database on the association of COVID-19 and children with cancer. We searched for papers dedicated to COVID-19 infection in children with cancer performing a PubMed-based retrieval of articles using the following search terms: 'tumor', 'cancer', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'chemotherapy', and 'neoplasm' and matched with 'COVID-19' adopting the filter 'child: birth-18 years'. We found only two articles and it resulted from the search 'chemotherapy' matched with 'COVID-19'. The first article was a case report in Chinese of a child affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia on maintenance therapy who developed a respiratory distress. 9 The other article was a report of a flash survey using a web-based form sent to 89 pediatric hematology/oncology units of different countries. Data were collected by 32 centers: among children receiving treatment for their tumor, only nine children were reported as affected ISSN: 1740-4398 EDITORIAL -Facing the COVID-19 outbreak in children with cancer drugsincontext.com by COVID-19 but eight of the nine confirmed cases were asymptomatic or with a mild illness. 10 Therefore, we have observed that no relevant reports have yet been published on this topic and no fatal case has been yet described.",

To our best knowledge, children receiving prolonged periods of multiagent chemotherapy causing mild or moderate immunocompromise are not at high risk of severe infection. [10] [11] [12] [13] Thus, current evidence indicates that is it not justified to interrupt or delay pediatric anticancer treatment; however, Cancer Research UK has recently proposed to stop recruiting patients in several cancer clinical trials because clinical staff are being redeployed to frontline COVID-19 care. 14 However, it is of great importance that some preventive measures are adopted in order to preserve the state of health and guarantee the care of our children. Initiatives to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 can help reduce the impact of the pandemic on cancer diagnosis and treatment and ensure continuity of care. 15 Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are fundamental parts of cancer treatment and healing. We also know, however, that cancer treatments increase the risks of infectious complications. We cannot, therefore, further increase the risk of compromising the lives of our children: treatment has to cope with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our experience, some active strategies can be suggested for the management of children with cancer receiving treatments during this pandemic. These are as follows:",
