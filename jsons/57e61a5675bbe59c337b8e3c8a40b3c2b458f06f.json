Retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA-5), are important pattern recognition receptors for viral elimination. Objective: The study aims to investigate the role of RIG-I and MDA-5 in COPD pathogenesis. Methods: We examined the expression of RIG-I and MDA-5 by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and Western blots in COPD patients and control subjects. Results: Our results showed that MDA-5 expression was upregulated in lung tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COPD patients and there was a negative correlation between MDA-5 mRNA levels and forced expiratory volume in 1 s %pred. COPD patients had higher interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-8 mRNA expression levels, and these inflammatory cytokines positively correlate with MDA-5 levels. However, there was no difference in the expression of RIG-I between COPD patients and control subjects. Conclusion: Our results suggested that MDA-5, but not RIG-I, may play a critical role in airway inflammation in COPD.",

The World Health Organization has predicted that COPD will be the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030 (2, 3) . Tissues from patients with COPD are characterized by chronic inflammation, mucus metaplasia, alveolar destruction and structural cell apoptosis (4) . Inflammation is an important factor in the development of COPD (5) . Inflammation in patients may be causally related to emphysema or other pathological alterations in the lungs and worsens with disease progression (6, 7) . Pulmonary inflammation might have an adverse impact on various extrapulmonary organs, such as blood vessels and the heart (8) (9) (10) . During the progression of pulmonary inflammation in COPD, both the innate immune and adaptive immune systems are involved. However, their specific mechanisms are still elusive. This is particularly true for the innate immune system, whose role is unknown during the inflammation response in COPD.",

            "text": "Innate immunity is the first line of defense against foreign pathogens. Its role in the airways involves the detection of pathogen-or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)like receptors (RLRs) (11) . Latent infection of adenoviruses in childhood can promote chronic inflammation and thus gradually lead to COPD (12) . Recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of viruses can cause exacerbation of the disease (13, 14) . Compared with exacerbation due to other causes, viral-induced COPD exacerbation is more severe, lasts longer and is associated with airway and systemic inflammatory responses (15, 16) . RLRs are newly discovered pattern recognition receptors, which play a critical role in the elimination of viral infections (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . RLRs include RIG-I, melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA-5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) (23) (24) (25) . These RLRs localize within the cytoplasm. When viral RNA binds to the C-terminal regulatory domain of RIG-I or MDA-5, it can initiate a signaling cascade leading to activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF-3, which are needed to turn on transcription of interferons (IFNs) (26) (27) (28) . The LGP2 lacks a caspase activation and recruitment domain and incapable of interferon production (29) .",

Structural cells, especially epithelial cells, endothelium and fibroblasts, take part in the airway inflammation. Patients with COPD are more susceptible to viral infections, and up to one half of cases of COPD exacerbations are associated with viral infections (16, 34) . An epidemiology survey illustrates that viral infection is the main cause of COPD exacerbation, and the top four causes are rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (13) .",

Both RIG-I and MDA-5 detect dsRNA in the cytoplasm, where they are linked to downstreamsignaling molecules via MAVS (35) . Previous studies have shown that human RIG-I and MDA-5 are implicated in the recognition of different groups of RNA viruses, and subsequently activate the NF-\u03baB-and IRF3/7-signaling pathways, resulting in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferons (36) . It has been shown that MDA5 and RIG-I recognize widely distinct groups of viruses. RIG-I preferentially detects variety of positive-and negative-strand viruses through recognition of a 5\u2032 triphosphate group of genomic RNAs such as influenza, paramyxovirus and flavivirus (37) . In contrast, MDA5 recognizes long dsRNAs through detection of dsRNA replication intermediates and genomic dsRNAs, and likely detects positive-strand and dsRNA viruses including RV and reoviruses (38) (39) (40) . An epidemiological survey has illustrated that RV, a positive and single-stranded RNA virus, is responsible for the majority of virus-induced COPD exacerbation (13, 34) . In COPD patients, RV infection causes a rapid decline in lung function. Recent studies by Wang and colleagues provide evidence that MDA-5, but not RIG-I, is responsible for recognizing RV, and subsequently activates the signaling pathways, causing an exaggerated inflammatory response in COPD patients, with increased levels of IL-8, IL-6, CXCL1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (41) . Baines and colleagues found that compared with healthy primary bronchial epithelial (pBECs), pBECs from COPD patients express large amounts of antiviral and proinflammatory agents and were highly susceptible to apoptosis when responded to RV infection (22) .",

However, we show for the first time that the basal level of MDA-5 is elevated in the bronchial mucosa and PBMCs from patients with COPD. Our data implies that the exaggerated inflammatory response to RV infection in COPD patients may be associated with the high level of MDA-5 in airway epithelial cells. Excess MDA-5 in COPD patients activated by RV could lead to induction of a 'cytokine flood' . This 'cytokine flood' is not only effective in facilitating viral clearance, but also may further contribute to airway inflammation.",

There was no significant correlation between the mRNA levels of MDA-5 in bronchial biopsy and FEV 1 %pred, which may have been due to the small number of bronchial biopsies samples in this study or the particular cell types present.

Compared with control group, COPD patients showed significant high level of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 (A), IL-8 (B) and interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 (C). Data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard error (SEM) (n = 24-29; **P values < 0.01 vs the control group). BALF were assayed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, and COPD patients showed significant high level of IL-8 (D) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (E) compared with control group.
