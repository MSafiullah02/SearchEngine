In the USA, the National Kidney Disease Education Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has established a Health Information Technology Working Group to facilitate the identification and management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using electronic health records (EHRs) (see Related links). In 2019, the group published a validated electronic phenotype for CKD identification using EHRs at five sites for >2 million patients3.",

A 2019 Cochrane review concluded that overall, the evidence for eHealth interventions is of low quality and insufficient to guide clinical practice in kidney disease6. Moreover, a randomized trial that included 601 patients with CKD found that an eHealth intervention that used home monitoring devices to obtain biometric data (for example, blood pressure and weight) and deliver multidisciplinary care did not reduce mortality, hospitalization rates, emergency department visits or nursing home admissions when compared with usual care4. However, patient acceptance and engagement with the eHealth intervention was high; 91% of participants completed 1 year of follow-up with an average of 14.2 completed virtual visits. On average, participants took 14.9 blood pressure measurements per month and used the educational modules on 5.8 days per month4. Multiple other studies have reported high participant satisfaction with kidney eHealth interventions for a variety of reasons, including ease of use, low burden and increased frequency and quality of interactions with health-care staff6.",

Importantly, patient ratings of app quality correlated poorly with provider ratings, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient input into eHealth solutions. The TAKE-IT trial assessed the efficacy of a multimodal intervention to promote medication adherence that incorporated patient input in the eHealth component8. The investigators randomly assigned 189 adolescent and young adult kidney transplant recipients across eight centres to either usual care or a multimodal adherence intervention and used an electronic pillbox to monitor adherence. In the intervention group, participants reviewed their own adherence data with a coach, identified barriers to adherence that they would like to address and used problem-solving methods with the coach to find solutions. Participants also chose how to receive medication reminders, either by text message, email or visual cues. The TAKE-IT intervention significantly improved medication adherence compared with the control group. This finding demonstrates that involving patients as stakeholders to individualize eHealth interventions and meet patient needs can improve outcomes.",

First, although eHealth can enhance disease detection and monitoring, it can introduce new safety concerns owing to suboptimal design, technological failures or invalid data. For example, the study of mobile apps discussed above found that only two of seven health tracking apps generated alerts for abnormal values such as extremely high blood pressure7. Device failures in clinical trials have resulted in reduced participant satisfaction, engagement and retention with eHealth monitoring6. Cuff-less blood pressure devices based on pulse transit time have been found to correlate with oscillometric measurements in research settings, but the accuracy depends on posture and the devices require frequent calibration9. Many wearable devices will require additional validation before clinical use. Clinicians and patients must remain vigilant about the potential for errors, particularly if eHealth tools are used in place of traditional monitoring without full validation.",

Certain aspects of the physical exam, such as examination of catheter exit sites, may be difficult to perform via video consultation. The physical presence of the provider may also be reassuring and comforting for patients with emotional distress4,5. Providing CKD education via web modules, mobile apps or text messaging may not fully address the complexity of kidney care or patient-specific questions. Thus, the US 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act allows patients to choose between telehealth and face-to-face encounters so that the care modality meets their individual needs5.",

Technological infrastructure and adequate security measures must be in place. For example, telehealth dialysis visits require equipment such as webcams and digital stethoscopes as well as access to a reliable internet service with sufficient speed to enable real-time video transmission. All hardware and software tools must meet relevant security standards, and patients and care providers must be trained to use the equipment correctly and conduct the visits securely5. An ongoing extension of the TAKE-IT study, TAKE-IT TOO, aims to address the practical issues of incorporating the TAKE-IT intervention into routine clinical practice8.
