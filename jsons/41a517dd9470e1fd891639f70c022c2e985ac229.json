The method, that was used for HIV-AIDS and was named 'back-calculation', relies on good estimates of the distribution of the delays between infection and the observed events; assuming that the epidemic follows a simple SIR model with a known generation interval, we can then estimate the parameters that define the time-varying contact rate through maximum likelihood. We show the application of the method to data from Italy and several of its region; it is found that R 0 had decreased consistently below 1 around March 20, and in the beginning of April it was between 0.5 and 0.8 in the whole Italy and in most regions.",

An important difference between HIV/AIDS and the COVID-19 infection, beyond the big difference in the time-scales involved, is that it was generally agreed that (almost) all patients infected with HIV would develop AIDS; hence, in principle, from the data on AIDS cases one could estimate the actual curve of HIV infections of several years earlier. On the other hand, it is known that a large proportion of infections with SARS-CoV2 are asymptomatic or mild and thus not diagnosed and not reported. Hence from the reported cases, one cannot recover the number of all infections, without other information. The output of the method will be an estimated curve of the infection times of the reported cases. Assuming that the proportion of infections that are reported is constant in time, the curve of actual infections will be a multiple of the estimated curve.",

The susceptible fraction does not appear in the equation, because we expect that, despite the high burden caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, the reduction of the susceptible fraction has been very modest in these months, except perhaps in a few small hot spots. However, a possible reduction in susceptibles would be interpreted in (4) as a reduction of contact rate. The two events that will be considered in this manuscript are deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19.

It is apparent that the fit with the function f 1 'Linton+Pellis' and f 2 'Linton+Linton\" is much better than with all alternatives; hence, only that one will be considered in what follows.

For the sake of simplicity, we will only show the results obtained with the function \u03c6 proposed by Flaxman et al. [9] . Most results have been obtained applying the estimation to the data of the whole Italy and of three regions of Northern Italy (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto).

The negative binomial was fitted, assuming a fixed value k = 3 of the dispersion parameter, value chosen after some trials. One can see from Figures 4 and 5 that the central estimates are extremely similar for the two likelihood; the main difference is in the confidence intervals that are much wider for the negative binomial likelihood, as expected. From the AIC one should choose the Poisson model for the Veneto region, and the negative binomial for the other units (although for Emilia-Romagna the difference in AIC between the two models is not large).

It can be noticed that our estimates of R 0 go consistently below 1 around March 20, more or less in correspondence of the government decree that ordered the closure of all non-essential working places. However, one has to consider that infections, when looked at this aggregated level, will always show a certain inertia: as 'lock-down' goes in place, new infections in the community will strongly decrease, but those that had already been infected will continue transmitting in households. It is then possible that already the previous measures could bring R 0 below 1 if left in place long enough; more detailed data and models would be needed to solve the issue. Transmission within households could also explain the apparent rebounding of R 0 estimated for Emilia-Romagna near the beginning of March (Fig. 5c) .",

In order to use the number of positive tests, we believe if would be needed to model how they depend on the number of performed tests, and this seems rather difficult. We concentrated instead on data on hospitalizations and deaths, as they should be less dependent on policy choices. It is certainly possible that, in the moments and place where the sanitary system was under stress, requirements for hospitalization became more stringent; in this sense, hospitalizations may not be purely depend on the health of the patients, but also on the sanitary context. Furthermore, a recent analysis of mortality rates in March suggests that the number of deaths related to COVID-19 has been higher than the numbers reported, at least in some areas of Lombardy region. Thus data on both deaths and hospitalizations may contain biases, but they are best data publicly available. Data on daily admissions to ICUs could have been useful, but we were not able to extract the information from the dataset. We do not attempt to give an estimate of the actual number of infected individuals, but only of the curve, up to a multiplicative constant. In principle, one could use the observed death rates [17] together with estimates of the 'true' death rates to extrapolate the number of infections compatible with the observed deaths as in Flaxman et al. [9] Although it is mainly a technical point, our analysis allows to discriminate among the different proposals for the distributions of times to death and hospitalizations. As can be seen from Table 1 , the model chooses the hospitalization kernel that gives more weigh to longer delays (red curve in Fig. 3a ) and the death kernel that gives more weigh to shorter delays (black curve in Fig. 3b) . The selected curves are such that the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization is 5.12 days (median 4.1) [16] , while the mean time from symptom onset to death is 15.2 days (median 13.8) [14] . The data published by the Italian Health Institute [1] estimate a median tim from symptom onset to hospitalization of 5 days, and from symptom onset to death of 10 days. This discrepancy between the estimates we used and Italian data might explain why the distance between the peak time of hospitalizations and of deaths is generally shorter in data than in our model (Fig. 4) ; the exception is the Veneto region (Fig. 4d) , where both peaks are well estimated by the model, possibly because there the distribution of times are closer to estimates in the literature. One has to take into account that our analysis is based on reporting dates; hence, the delays between hospitalization or death and their reporting have also to be considered. Clearly, results depend in an essential way on good estimates of delay functions, and on the assumption they they are constant in time and among the regions. The method can be easily adapted to delays changing in time, as long as data are available to estimate this.",

As can be seen (Fig. 9 ), the number of knots changes the results very little; similarly changing the final date of fitting (Fig. 10) between April 3, 6 or 9 changes the estimates only for the very final part of fitting; moreover, the differences in the estimated final R 0 are minor, although extrapolating the simulations 30 days ahead they would bring quite a difference in the predicted number of hospitalizations. Looking at the crosses (data not used in the fits) in all Figures, one can get an idea of the short-term predictive capabilities of the model. One may notice that for a few days after April 6 the estimated number of hospitalizations have a large increase, that appears inconsistent with the model and the rest of the curve. We found out that the number of reported discharged patients in the four days between April 8 and 11 was over 2,000 per day, while previously it averaged around 1,000 a day with a peak around 1,500, and the number decreased again from April 12 onwards. Since the reported number of hospitalized patients did not decrease sharply, formula (1) estimates a peak of new hospitalizations between April 8 and 11 that is very far from model predictions. We can think of three explanations: perhaps data reporting was not precise, and several patients reported as discharged between April 8 and 11 had actually been discharged previously, so that the correct hospitalization curve would have a less sharp decrease after the peak around March 20-25, and no peak between April 8 and 11. Another possibility is that a large number of patients was actually discharged between April 8 and 11, freeing hospital space and thus allowing to hospitalize patients previously in home isolation; in this case, the hospitalization peak of April 8-11 would have occurred, but because of procedures of the health system. Finally, the hospitalization peak might reflect a peak in new infections occured a few days earlier for unknown reasons. Probably the health authorities are aware of the hospital situation, but we think that simple graphs like the ones presented here help in identifying patterns needing an explanation.",

Emilia-Romagna is somewhat interemediate in this respect, possibly because of the presence of two infection foci at the ends of the region (Piacenza and Rimini).

With that caveat, recent estimates of R 0 for Piemonte have been consistently above 1, and this corresponds also to the visual impression from data.
