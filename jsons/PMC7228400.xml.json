In this study, sequence from 95 strains were examined and 12 locations where mutations occurred in \u22653 strains were found. Importantly, among these locations, mutations were found at nt8782 of ORF 1a, nt28144 of ORF 8, and nt29095 of N region in 28, 29, and 11 strains, respectively. Therefore, data from this study showed that, while designing PCR primers and probes, sequences in these locations should be avoided, and attention must be paid to locations listed in Table S2 and S3 to avoid false negative results. Furthermore, some published primer/probe sequences were compared to the reference sequence established and differences were found. This might partially explain why false negative results in nucleic acid detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 for diagnosis of COVID\u201019 is currently not uncommon. Sequence variation information obtained and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 reference sequence established in this study can provide reliable guidance for the design of primers/probes with maximal sensitivity for detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid.",

Hotspot mutations in ORFs 1a, S, 8, and the N region will cause changes in the amino acid sequences of these proteins, and the effects of these mutations on viral replication, transmission and the induced immune responses need to be further investigated. The significance of these variations is unclear, and may be directed mutations adapted to the environment.",
