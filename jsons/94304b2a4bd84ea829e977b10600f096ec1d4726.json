Multiple, complex regulatory pathways manifest chronic pulmonary disorders, which require chemotherapeutics that produce composite inhibitory effect. The cost effective natural product based molecules hold a high fervor to meet the prospects posed by current respiratory-distress therapy by sparing the tedious drug design and development archetypes, present a robust standing for the possible replacement of the fading practice of poly-pharmacology, and ensure the subversion of a potential disease relapse. This study summarizes the experimental evidences on natural products moieties and their components that illustrates therapeutic efficacy on respiratory disorders.",

The figures for asthma further raise the alarm with 334 million people suffering from the disease, which includes 14% of children [1] . Notably, pneumonia; caused by bacteria streptococcus pneumonia raises the mortality rate among children below 5 years of age. Tuberculosis, a chronic respiratory ailment caused by bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis affects 10 million people annually, out of which 1.4 million lose lives. In addition, lung cancer represents a fatal, yet most common neoplasm claiming roughly 2 million lives annually [2] .",

The heightened oxidative stress caused by CS dissociates transcription factor Nrf2 from kelch-like ECHassociated protein 1 (Keap1) [36] , eventually translocating into nucleus followed by binding to antioxidant response elements (ARE). These events regulate downstream gene expression for phase II detoxification enzymes such as glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), glutathione Stransferase (GST), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) [37] , that promote in maintaining cellular redox balance [38] . Therefore, Nrf2 signaling pathways present potential therapeutic target against the physiological redox imbalance [39] . Liu et al. 2020 ; investigated the therapeutic potential of six isosteroid alkaloids (2-7, Figure 2) obtained from F. cirrhosa bulbus against the CS induced oxidative stress in RAW264.7 macrophages. Reportedly, the identified six test alkaloids significantly attenuated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), upregulated the level of antioxidant molecule glutathione (GSH), and promoted the Nrf2 induced expression of HO-1 protein. Notably, the presence of glucoside moiety at C-3 position in alkaloid 5, and absence of \u03b2-OH at C-17 position in alkaloid 6 resulted in higher GSH/GSSG ratio. Similarly, the presence of \u03b2-CH 3 substituent at C-20 position in alkaloid 3 favored its efficacy and tolerable cytotoxicity. The presence of -OH substitution at C-3 position in all the test alkaloids demonstrated a paramount importance for inducing HO-1 expression, which diminished in the presence of C=O group at the same position [40] .

Oral pretreatment of animal models with the test alkaloid warifteine significantly reduced the allergen induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR) to inhaled methacholine. Moreover, it also reduced the IL-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage, which serves as the key regulator of AHR [46] . The test alkaloid checked the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced eosinophil intrusion in the tissues, and downregulated the mucus production and subepithelial fibrosis. Further analysis of airway mucins by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining revealed OVA induced metaplasia and mucus accumulation in animal models, which reduced significantly after warifteine administration. Kim et al. 2015 ; reported attenuation of IL-4 and eotaxin-2 mediated eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthmatic animal models by the alkaloid 'chelidonine' (16, Figure 2 ) isolated from Chelidonium majus [47] . The test alkaloid significantly suppressed the level of eosinophils in the airways, in addition to downregulation of eotaxin-2, interleukins, and cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Notably, chelidonine treated animal models exhibited considerable decrease of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, Gr-1 + /CD11b + and 351 CD3/CCR3 + positive cells, which otherwise intensify inflammation process by secreting Th2 cytokines and degranulation of eosinophils [48] . Histological analysis suggested marked attenuation of OVA-induced eosinophil subversion, goblet cell hyperplasia, and accumulation of collagen in ling tissues in the presence of chelidonine. These findings validated the therapeutic potency of this alkaloid in the treatment of pathologic inflammatory disorders associated with respiratory airways. catabolism pathway in the host microbe, which is essential for its survival and for the persistence of ensuing infection.

These alkaloids formed the basis of identification of suitable pharmacophores for rationally designing the pharmaceuticals against dormant mycobacterium. injury caused by H1N1 virus [63] . The animal models exposed to test flavonoids maintained the morphology of diseased lung microstructures, attenuated the penetration of proinflammatory factors MCP-1, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and malondialdehyde that play crucial role in the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils at the site of stimulus [64] . However, the levels of interferon-\u03b2 elevated, which played a key role in restricting the replication of virus [65] . In addition, the expression of TLR3/4/7 and level of NF-\u03ba \u03b2 p65 phosphorylation lowered in the lung tissues, which are associated with heightened activation and secretion of interferon-\u03b2 [66] . Hence, the test flavonoids directed anti-inflammatory therapy served deliberated approach for countering IAV induced pathological processed manifesting acute lung injury. Reportedly, the flavonoids 54 and 56 ( Figure 4 ) displayed enhanced biocidal potential against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain with IC50 = 6.25 and 25 \u00b5g/ ml respectively [67] . The biocidal potential of the test flavonoids proved better than the standard anti-TB drugs isoniazid and rifampicin.",

MtPKnG, a protein kinase G produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents serine/ threonine kinase enzyme, which prolongs the survival rate of the bacterium in host macrophages by preventing the phagosome-lysosome fusion [68] . The enzyme mediates phosphorylation of proteins associated with essential signal transduction pathways in bacteria and allegedly sustains the tuberculosis infection in the host [69] . Notably, the MtPKnG enzyme prompts anti-TB drug resistance in mycobacteria and serves as a key component for mycobacterial biofilms production. Hence, it forms a desirable target for anti-TB drug discovery against resistant mycobacteria. The drug resistance in microbes arises due to over-activity of the membrane bound efflux pumps that prevent the drug internalization in cells. The lack of clinically approved efflux pump inhibitors further aggravate the disease pathogenesis. Polymethoxylated flavonoids 60-64 ( Figure   5 ) reportedly reduced the rifampicin resistance and adversely affected the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Importantly, the bioactivity of anti-TB drug isoniazid enhanced in the presence of test flavonoids [71] . However, further investigations could not quantify the insight mechanism for the behavior of test flavonoids towards mycobacterium efflux pumps.",

Squill oxymel was able to significantly increases the force expiratory volume (FEV) 1 liter, FEV1%, FEV1/force vital capacity (FVC%), and maximal mid expiratory flow (MEF) as compared to placebo. There was a remarkable improvement in symptoms, activity, and total score in the patients administered Squill Oxymel but not in the placebo group. Moreover, there was no serious adverse observed except minor nausea and vomiting reported in five patients in Squill oxymel group. This trail showed a strong potential of Squill Oxymel in terms of safety and efficacy for asthma patient [112] . concentrations as well as Th1 switch in the Th1/Th2 balance [113] . The alkaloids such as theophylline, lobeline, and narceine have been commercialized as adenovasin, citotal, and peneraj respectively for relieving chronic symptoms associated with asthma, however several molecules fail to clear the clinical trials prior to successful commercialization [114, 115] .",

The changes in nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) target gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages as well as measurement of oxidative damage, airway inflammation, and pulmonary function tests were tested. However, sulforaphane did not induce the Nrf2 target gene expression and no significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity appeared as compared to placebo control [116] .

Both groups tolerate the treatment very well as there was no serious adverse events observed [118] . Similarly in Kemmerich B study, 183 patients with acute bronchitis were given with 1 tablet of thyme-primose combination thrice a day for 11 days and the efficacy was compared with placebo (N= 178 patients).

Similarly, the pulmonary disorders caused by multidrug-resistant microbes such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, and streptococcus pneumoniae requires innovative pharmaceuticals with multifarious targeting potential. Reportedly, the isoniazid monotherapy or rifampicin or pyrazinamide bitherapy proved inadequate for the disease management and resulted in its recurrent cycles. Hence, the recommended anti-TB regimen suggests polypharmacy as preliminary combination therapy of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine to prevent the recurrence of disease. Nevertheless, the amenability of the subjects to the combination of drugs, and the probability of microbial susceptibility to the administered doses raises compulsion for the identification of physiologically tolerable, novel pharmacophores for which the natural products present an ideal profile.

The administration of alkaloids in animal models with histamine induced asthma, downregulated eosinophils expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum along with notable attenuation of IgE, IL-4 and IL-5. The alkaloid demonstrated spasmolytic effects on acetylcholine chloride-induced contractions in the animal trachea [49]. Kim et al. 2019; identified natural bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids 19, 20 and 21 (Figure 2) form stephania tetrandra, which inhibited human coronavirus OC43 infection of MRC-5 human lung cells at its early stages. Coronaviruses infect the respiratory tract thereby manifesting severe conditions such as bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [50]. The test alkaloids reportedly restricted the replication of human coronavirus OC43, restrained the expression of viral protein and virus-induced response of the host MRC-5 cells. Notably, the alkaloid 19 (Figure 2) activated the p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway in the virus infected cells, which eventually improved their viability with minimal signs of cytotoxicity. The MRC-5 cells exposed to the test alkaloids showed negligible expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which are otherwise upregulated by the virus infection [51]. Deep-water sponges of the genus Pakina yield therapeutic alkaloid 22 (Figure 3), which displayed considerable bactericidal efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain CDC1551.

The infected animal models demonstrated a better metabolic transformation of the test flavonoids to active metabolites, with elevated levels in lungs and intestine, with higher content in the latter suggesting that the test flavonoids reach intestine first and then transformed to active metabolites before finally becoming a part of systemic circulation. The active metabolites 47-53 after reaching the lungs reportedly downregulate the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), while raising the levels of IL-10 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and considerably lowered the production of nitric oxide (NO) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells thereby attenuating the activity of target virus[62].",

The administration of flavonoid 60 (Figure 5) also mitigated the collagen deposition in subepithelium, and suppressed goblet cell hyperplasia. Hence, the test flavonoid served as bradykinin antagonist and diminished the principal pathophysiological characteristics associated with allergic asthma [72]. Jeon et al. 2017; isolated flavonoid 65 (Figure 5), which exerted bactericidal effect on drug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain. The test flavonoid reportedly inhibited the release of proinflammatory interleukins and attenuated the expression of TNF-\u03b1. The test flavonoid 65 (Figure 5) exhibits high affinity binding to M. tuberculosis \u03b2-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase III (mtKASIII) enzyme via interactions of A-ring 2-OH and B-ring 4-OH groups of the flavonoid with N261 and C122 residues [73]. Importantly the open chain structure of phloretin permits membrane permeability against the mycobacterial cell wall, which protects the microbe from antibiotics and allows its persistence and proliferation in macrophages. The flavonoids 66 and 67 (Figure 5) isolated from Mosla chinensis Maxim exerted inhibitory potential against H1N1 influenza virus mainly by downregulating the expression of the host TLR signaling pathways [74]. In addition, the upregulation of critical factors (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and NO) and suppression of IL-2, SOD and cytokine GSH caused significant reduction of virus instigated inflammatory damage to lung tissues. Pawar et al. 2020, investigated the antitubercular activity of flavonoids 68 and 69 (Figure 5) by targeting glutamate racemase enzyme of the microbe associated with the synthesis of membrane peptidoglycans by transforming Lglutamate to D-glutamate. The enzyme also plays a key role in DNA gyrase sequestration. The test flavonoids introduced deformations in the secondary and tertiary structure of the target enzyme by attenuating the helical contents, which manifested morphological changes in the microbial membrane. The interaction of test flavonoids with active site residues D12, C75, C185, and H187; present at the substrate binding site of glutamate racemase enzyme prompted its inhibition [75]. The flavonoids 70, 71 and 72 (Figure 5) proved highly efficacious for capping severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by coronaviruses by inhibition of 3C-like proteases (3CLpro), responsible for autocleavage of viral polyproteins essential for viral propagation. The test flavonoids significantly blocked the enzyme activity by interacting effectively with the substrate-binding site via hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic -OH groups [76]. Mulberry root bark served as principal component for the isolation of prenylated flavonoid class 'sanggenols' 73-77 (Figure 5) bearing dual activity against influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The prenylated flavonoids displayed high physiological tolerance while having an inhibitory potential superior to the standard drug olestamivir against the target neuraminidase (NA) enzyme, which sustains lethal synergy between the influenza virus and S. pneumoniaeassisting the sustenance and longevity of the both[77].",

The exposure to limonene significantly reduced the levels of interleukins-3/ 5, eotaxin, MCP-1, TGF-\u03b2 in the bronchoalveolar lavages. In addition, the limonene administration abrogated gblet cell metaplasia, airway fibrosis, and thickness of the airway smooth muscles. These finding validated the candidature of limonene as prophylactic agent in asthma treatment [80]. Alavinezhad et al. 2017; investigated the therapeutic effect of carvacrol (79, Figure 6) on asthma subjects. The carvacrol exposure induced relaxant effect on the tracheal smooth muscles by reducing the total WBC, neutrophil, monocyte and eosinophil count in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the sensitized animal models. The relaxant effect of carvacrol occurs due to the significant attenuation of pro-inflammatory biometabolites in systemic circulation [81].

The LPS-challenged animals showed improved pathological changes in lung tissues on thymol exposure. Reportedly, the LPS-induced influx of the inflammatory cells and metabolites, interlukins and TNF-\u03b1 attenuated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on thymol administration. In addition, thymol also restrained the LPS-mediated upsurge of MDO and MPS levels, and considerably lowered the activity of SOD thereby pausing the activation of NF-\u03baB in the lungs [84]. These neutrophil localized enzymes primarily influence the adhesion and margination of neutrophils in the lung thereby causing severe lung injury. Mohammadi et al. 2018; evaluated immunomodulatory effects of thymol in mitigating oxidative stress associated with asthma immunopathogenesis. Thymol-exposure attenuated the levels of 8-OHdG, an oxidative marker in asthma and carbonyl protein released by peroxidases from eosinophils in the airway passages, which elevates musine secretion, overexpresses cytokines and elevates apoptosis of epithelial cells lining airway passages. Reportedly, thymol affords considerable cytoprotective effect against the oxidative stress and moderately reinstates the defective trace element levels in asthma [85]. Gabri et al. 2019; studied the ameliorative effects of thymoquinone (81, Figure 6) on the LPSinduced pulmonary vascular damage. The protective effect appears because of the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and interleukins in the presence of thymoquinone.",

Thymoquinone reportedly attenuated the expression of IL-4/5 and improved the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule1 (CD31) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actinalpha (\u03b1-SMA) in ovalbumin-sensitized animals. In addition, thymoquinone deactivated VEGFR2-PI3K-Akt pathway and upregulated the expression of Slit glycoprotein-2 (Slit-2), which validates its anti-neoangiogenesis effect in asthma amelioration [88]. Qamar et al. 2008; investigated farnesol (82, Figure 6) for the effective amelioration of lung injury caused by cigarette smoke, known to cause pulmonary emphysema, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis. The isoprenoids such as farnesol possesses excellent anti-nociceptive and chemopreventive potency and demonstrates protection against chronic lung inflammation, oxidative stress and lung injury caused by cigarette smoke intoxicants. The prophylactic treatment with farnesol showed lung-protective symptoms by lowering LDH levels, and lowered activity of reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase enzymes. The lowered H 2 O 2 content in lung tissues further validated the cytoprotective effects of lung tissues against cigarette smoke [89]. Farnesol proved efficacious in the alleviation of benzopyrene-induced respiratory stress in animal models. Farnesol also sustained optimal levels of phospholipids and altered the catalytic activity of benzopyrene enzymes NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) in the lung tissues of animal models. These findings suggested the protective role of farnesol against benzopyrene induced lung inflammation, edema, and epithelial damages in subject animals [90].

TDI represents the major cause of occupational asthma culminating 15 % of the global asthma deaths. The exposure of the respiratory airways to oxidants results in epithelial cell necrosis and functional impairment due to defective expression of adherens junction proteins such as E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Hence, E-cadherin maintains epithelial barrier stability of the airway mucosa and allergic sensitization, which lowers in asthma condition thereby promoting the infiltration of oxidants via defected airway epithelium [94]. Andrographolide exposure maintained airway integrity by reversing the distribution of aberrant airway epithelial E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. In addition, it led to the attenuation of TNF-\u03b1 induced production of oxidants and ROS via upregulation of Nrf2 through Akt phosphorylation [95]. Lampronti et al. 2017; reported therapeutic potential of \u03b2-sitosterol (87, Figure 7) extracted from Nigella arvensis L., in mitigating the expression of cytokine genes in cystic fibrosis epithelial cells lining bronchi. The test terpene significantly reduced the expression of neutrophilic chemokines IL-8, GRO-\u03b1, and GRO-\u03b2 in LPS-sensitized human bronchial epithelial cells. These chemokines play a critical role in the recruitment of neutrophils in the lungs inflamed with cystic fibrosis. The investigations suggested that \u03b2-sitosterol partially inhibited LPS-triggered activation of Protein Kinase C isoform alpha, associated with transmembrane signaling for the activation of the expression of IL-8 gene in bronchial epithelial cells. Hence, \u03b2-sitosterol effectively mitigates the chronic lung inflammation in the patients with cystic fibrosis [96].Further investigations suggested the attenuation of pulmonary fibrosis by \u03b2-sitosterol, by preventing the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), manifesting deleterious effects to the alveolar epithelium resulting in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). \u03b2-sitosterol, reportedly displayed anti-fibrotic effect while inhibiting EMT by downregulating the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Notably, treatment with \u03b2-sitosterol convincingly blocked TGF-\u03b21-induced protein expression of EMT markers, N-cadherin, vimentin, and E-cadherin[97].Kim et al. 2012; studied effect of Ursolic acid(88,",

The perseverance of nonspecific macrophages and adaptive T-lymphocytes even after the prolonged stimuli cassation inappropriately instigates the memory cells of adaptive immunity, an event further maintained by dendritic cells, which also induce remodeling of lung tissue. In addition, the oxidative stress and disturbance in protease/ antiprotease balance deter the beneficial effects of corticosteroids in managing airway inflammation.The ensuing effects include increased thickness of the bronchial wall leading to narrowing of the lumen, increased tone of bronchial smooth muscle leading to loss of elasticity and mucus oversecretion, proliferation of fibroblasts, detrimental extracellular matrix, and apoptosis in the endothelial cells. The involvement of multiple regulatory pathways in mediating respiratory disorders necessitates the development of multi-targeting medications.
