The primary endpoint of the current study is the difference in the number of total bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid between patients receiving standard oral care and those treated with topical povidone iodine in addition to oral care at 3 h after intervention. From the results of our previous study, assuming that logarithm of number of bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid after 3 h in the control group is 7.0 \u00b1 0.8 cfu/mL and it reduces to 6.0 cfu/mL in the intervention group, when assigned by 2:1, alpha error is 0.05, and power is 80%, the required number of cases is 24 cases. The allocation will be determined by data manager responsible for biostatistical analysis. This open-labeled, randomized controlled study included 23 patients who received mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit of Nagasaki University Hospital between April and September 2018. Inclusion criteria are 20\u201390 years old patients with ventilator by oral intubation. One patient who could not collect saliva due to dry mouth was excluded from the study. Informed consent to participate was obtained in writing for patients admitted for surgery, but in some patients for emergency admission verbally from family members.",

However, their studies were conducted with historical controls. Moreover, it remained unclear whether their oral care procedures actually reduced oral bacteria and how long the effects of oral care lasted. Hayashida et al. [14] reported that number of bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid increased rapidly after intubation without growth of dental plaque, and stated that dental plaque was not a main reservoir of oropharyngeal bacteria in mechanically intubated patients.

Some studies have investigated the effects of oral decontamination on VAP prevention. Rodriguez-Rold\u00e1n et al. [18] reported that topical application of a paste containing tobramycin, amphotericin B, and polymyxin E in the oral cavity reduced the risk of VAP in 13 ventilated patients, although the overall mortality was not improved. Abele-Horn et al. [19] also reported that the incidence of VAP was reduced by topical administration of that same paste in 58 ventilated patients. Bergmans et al. [20] reported that topical antimicrobial prophylaxis consisting of an orabase paste containing gentamycin, colistin, and vancomycin reduced the risk of VAP in 92 patients. However, these studies failed to demonstrate the effect of topical antibiotics on decreasing mortality rate or hospital day. Furthermore, antibiotic administration may promote the emergence of resistant bacteria; therefore, the topical use of antibiotics is not recommended for mechanically ventilated patients.",

Although topical application of 0.12% chlorhexidine is a standard procedure in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, its use in the oral mucosa is not approved in Japan because of reports of anaphylactic shock. Similar to chlorhexidine, povidone iodine has antibacterial activity and is approved for use in the oral cavity. However, it is not commonly used to prevent VAP. It has been suggested that povidone-iodine is cytotoxic to normal mucosal cells, and it has been pointed out that prolonged use of povidone iodine may cause tooth coloring. The CDC guidelines 2017 [22] recommend the use of iodine before wound closure during surgery, so we believe that the usefulness of the disinfecting effect outweighs the cytotoxicity concerns.",

The present study showed that povidone iodine reduced the number of oral bacteria for at least 3 h after oral care in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, the results of real-time PCR showed that topical povidone iodine did not disturb the balance of the oral microbiota or promote the growth of bacteria resistant to antibiotics (e.g., MRSA) or fungi. These findings suggest that topical application of povidone iodine is a simple and safe method to reduce oral bacteria for a longer time that could be used as standard prophylaxis against VAP in Japan\u2014similar to 0.12% chlorhexidine globally. In this study, we investigated only up to 3 h after application, so it would be necessary to study for a longer time to establish an appropriate oral care method.",
