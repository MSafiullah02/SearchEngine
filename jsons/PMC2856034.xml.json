An ELISA was used to screen for interactions between DENV NS1 and human complement proteins. Microtiter plates were adsorbed with purified human complement proteins (Fig. 1 and not depicted). Serum-free supernatants from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells that stably propagate a DENV-2 subgenomic replicon (BHK-DENV2-Rep cells) and secrete high levels (up to 4 \u00b5g/ml) of NS1 (Avirutnan et al., 2007) and from control BHK cells were added to complement protein-coated wells. Bound DENV NS1 was detected using specific mAbs (Puttikhunt et al., 2003; Avirutnan et al., 2007). A strong interaction between DENV NS1 and C4 or C4b was identified (Fig. 1 A). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the NS1 and C4/C4b interaction (Fig. 1, B\u2013E). However, the interaction of C4 or C4b and DENV NS1 is noncovalent, as the two proteins independently migrate at their expected sizes by electrophoresis and Western blot.",

Each purified complement component was sequentially added to Ab-sensitized E (EA) in the presence or absence of DENV NS1. Preincubation of purified DENV NS1 with human C4, but not with C1, C2, or C3 (unpublished data) interfered with hemolysis in three different assays in which the complement proteins were limiting: (a) addition of purified components C1, C4, and C2 to EA (EAC14b2a) followed by an incubation with a 20-fold dilution of guinea pig serum (GPS) as the source of C3 and terminal complement components (C5-C9) in an EDTA containing buffer (GPS-EDTA; Fig. 2 A); (b) sequential addition of purified human C1-C9 to EA, in which purified C3-C9 was added to EAC14b2a instead of GPS-EDTA (Fig. 2 B); and (c) a single-step hemolysis assay in which EA were incubated with an 80-fold dilution of C4-deficient GPS supplemented with human C4 that had been preincubated in the presence or absence of DENV NS1 (Fig. 2 C). The specificity of DENV NS1 for inhibiting hemolytic activity was confirmed in preclearance experiments (Fig. S1 A) as follows: preincubation of DENV NS1 with anti-NS1 (2G6)\u2013 but not anti-E (4G2)\u2013Sepharose abolished the inhibitory effect (Fig. S1 B). Notably, the amount and inhibitory activity of DENV NS1 after the preclearing step with 4G2\u2013Sepharose was similar to that observed with a 1:2 dilution of starting material. The concentrations of NS1 used in these studies have been observed in plasma and pleural fluid of human patients infected with severe DENV infection (Alcon et al., 2002; Libraty et al., 2002; Avirutnan et al., 2006). Collectively, these functional experiments suggest that DENV NS1 specifically inhibits CP-induced lysis of targets via an interaction with C4.",

Pre-incubation of DENV NS1 with human C4 reduced C4b and C3b deposition in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3) and prevented cell lysis (Fig. 2, A\u2013C). As expected, equivalent amounts of the control protein (BSA) did not interfere with C4b and C3b deposition (Fig. 3). To test if soluble NS1 also attenuates complement deposition on the cell surface of nucleated mammalian cells, we used an established Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell model system of complement activation (Barilla-LaBarca et al., 2002; Liszewski et al., 2008). Cells were sensitized with a polyclonal Ab against CHO cell surface antigens and the magnitude of C4b and C3b deposition was monitored by flow cytometry. Purified human CP complement components (C1, C4, C2, and C3) were preincubated with DENV NS1 in solution and subsequently added to Ab-sensitized CHO cells. As expected, DENV NS1 but not BSA decreased the amount of C4b and C3b deposited on the CHO cell surface (Fig. 3, E and F).",

To test whether DENV NS1 had this activity, we again used a hemolysis assay. In contrast to a soluble complement regulator, C4 binding protein (C4BP), which interferes with CP convertase assembly (Gigli et al., 1979), incubation of DENV NS1 with C1- and C4-treated EA (EAC14b) before adding C2 did not inhibit hemolysis (Figs. S1 and S2 A). The same result was obtained if CP C3 (C4b2a) or C5 (C4b2a3b) convertase was used; thus, incubation with DENV NS1 did not alter lytic activity whereas addition of the human regulators soluble complement receptor 1 (sCR1) and C4BP readily dissociated the convertases and inhibited the CP-induced hemolysis (Fig. S2, B and C).

The ratio of the \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 chain of C4 and C4b was analyzed by Western blot. If NS1 acted by inhibiting C4 cleavage by C1s, we would expect greater amounts of C4-\u03b1 compared with C4b-\u03b1\u2032 chain. Instead, preincubation of DENV NS1 with C4, before addition of C1s, increased the generation of the C4b-\u03b1\u2032 chain (Fig. 5 A). This result was initially surprising to us because, if NS1 promoted C4b-\u03b1\u2032 chain accumulation on the erythrocyte cell surface, it should have enhanced hemolysis. However, a loss of C4-\u03b1 chain and accumulation of C4b \u03b1\u2032 chain was also observed in the absence of C1s when C4 was incubated with WNV NS1 but not with control proteins, BSA or lysozyme (Fig. 5 A); thus, NS1-dependent C4 cleavage in the fluid phase was analogous to that observed with C1s (Fig. 5 B). Cleavage of C4 in the presence of NS1 was also confirmed by detection of the small fragment C4a (Fig. 5 C). Nonetheless, C4 cleavage in the presence of NS1 was specific; incubation of purified C3 with NS1 did not result in degradation of the C3 \u03b1 chain, even after prolonged incubation at 37\u00b0C (Fig. S4).",

Among the protease inhibitors tested including phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and commercial protease inhibitor cocktails (data not shown), the NS1-dependent C4b \u03b1\u2032 chain accumulation was most efficiently inhibited by the plasma serine protease inhibitor, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH; Fig. 5 C).

Initially, a two-step purification was performed to generate highly purified preparations of NS1 (Avirutnan et al., 2007). The elution profile of affinity-purified WNV NS1 (first column) followed by ion-exchange (second) column displays a heterogeneous profile (Fig. 6 A), which is likely caused by the presence of oligomers of soluble NS1 (Flamand et al., 1999; Fig. S5). The heterogeneity in size was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6 F and Fig. S6). After purification, each fraction of NS1 was tested for C4 inhibitory activity in the hemolysis assay, as well as the presence of hamster C1s by Western blot with a cross-reactive anti\u2013human C1s polyclonal Ab. After separation by ion-exchange chromatography, all fractions of WNV NS1 had C4 inhibitory activity, with the exception of the main peak fractions (B8-B10; Fig. 6 B). In our functional experiments (Figs. 2\u20135), high concentrations of NS1 (20\u201350 \u00b5g/ml) were required to inhibit hemolysis. However, when the fraction with peak activity (fraction C1; Fig. 6, A and B) was serially diluted and subjected to the C4 hemolysis assay, the specific C4 inhibitory activity was observed at a much lower concentration of NS1 (1.75 \u00b5g/ml; Fig. 6 C). Hamster C1s was detected in most of the fractions of purified WNV NS1 that had C4 inhibitory activity, but not in the NS1 fractions that lacked activity (Fig. 6 D). Correspondingly, the fractions of WNV NS1 after size exclusion chromatography that exhibited inhibitory activity in the C4 hemolysis assay (Fig. 6, F and G) also had detectable levels of C1s (Fig. 6 H). Although similar results were observed with DENV NS1, hamster C1s was not detected in purified fractions of YFV NS1 (not depicted); consistent with this, YFV NS1 bound C4, but did not inhibit in the hemolysis assay (Fig. 4 B).",

When proC1s was run alone, Western blot analysis showed that it was present exclusively in fractions B9 and B10 (Fig. 7 A).

We reasoned that a nonspecific interaction should not affect the inherent enzymatic activity of C1s. However, if NS1 enhanced the C4 cleavage activity of C1s, it would strongly support the concept of a specific functional interaction. We evaluated this hypothesis using a modified hemolysis assay. Purified NS1 was preincubated with human C1s or proC1s before the addition of human C4; subsequently, C4-deficient GPS was added to sensitized sheep EA. Higher concentrations of C4 were used in this assay compared with the previous hemolysis experiments to overcome the inherent C4 cleavage activity of hamster C1s/proC1s that copurified with WNV and DENV NS1. Notably, WNV and DENV NS1, but not BSA or lysozyme, enhanced the activity of C1s and proC1s to cleave C4 as observed by decreased hemolysis (Fig. 8, A and B). Most importantly, although purified YFV NS1 did not associate significantly with hamster C1s/proC1s to promote degradation of C4 by itself (Fig. 4 B), it readily bound human C1s/proC1s (Fig. 7, G and H), which then facilitated cleavage of C4 (Fig. 8, A and B) in a manner similar to WNV and DENV NS1. Acceleration of C4 degradation in solution by human proC1s in the presence of YFV NS1 was confirmed in kinetic experiments (Fig. 8 C). This activity was specific to NS1, as lysozyme or BSA did not alter the kinetics of C4 cleavage by proC1s (Fig. 8 C and not depicted).",

Because Flavivirus NS1 antagonizes C4 and subsequent C3 deposition, we hypothesized that soluble NS1 that accumulates to high amounts (up to 50 \u00b5g/ml) in serum (Alcon et al., 2002) could protect DENV from direct complement-mediated neutralization. As expected, DENV was efficiently neutralized by naive wild type GPS (Fig. 9 A). In contrast, C4-deficient GPS or heat-inactivated wild-type serum failed to diminish DENV infectivity, confirming a complement-dependent neutralization mechanism (Fig. 9, A and B). Addition of purified human C4 to guinea pig C4-deficient serum restored the ability to neutralize DENV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9 B). Importantly, the addition of soluble DENV NS1 (Fig. 9 B) or WNV NS1 (not depicted), but not BSA, rescued infectivity. This antagonistic effect of NS1 was C4-dependent, as addition of higher concentrations of human C4 overcame the inhibition of GPS neutralization by NS1. Although one study suggested that pretreatment of cells with soluble DENV NS1 before infection of hepatoma cells improves virus yield twofold (Alcon-LePoder et al., 2005), we did not observe this phenomenon; when NS1 was added alone or mixed with heat-inactivated serum, no changes in infectivity were observed (Fig. 9 B and not depicted). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that soluble NS1 can antagonize C4 function, which affects viral infection.",

WNV NS1 has previously been shown to attenuate alternative pathway activation by recruiting complement regulator factor H to facilitate C3b inactivation by factor I (Chung et al., 2006a). Herein, we define a novel mechanism in which NS1 restricts classical/lectin pathway activation by targeting C4. Binding of soluble NS1 to proC1s/C1s and C4 enhances the cleavage of C4 to C4b in solution, thus decreasing activation by the classical and lectin pathways. The interaction between Flavivirus NS1, C1s, and C4 has functional consequences, including reduced deposition of C3b and C4b on virions and target cells and protection of virus from complement-mediated neutralization.",

            "text": "The targeting of C4 in the context of an NS1 interaction with proC1s/C1s is a novel evasion strategy to attenuate classical and lectin pathway activation. Herpesviruses and coronaviruses interfere with CP activation by secreting or expressing decoy molecules with Fc receptor function (Oleszak et al., 1993; Para et al., 1982), whereas Porphyromonas, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus bacteria degrade IgG and/or inhibit IgG interaction with C1q (Bj\u00f6rck and Kronvall, 1984; Schenkein et al., 1995; von Pawel-Rammingen and Bj\u00f6rck, 2003). Additionally, the Staphylococcus SCIN and Efb proteins block CP and alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases (Rooijakkers et al., 2005; Jongerius et al., 2007). Mechanistically, NS1 promotes cleavage of C4 in solution, which attenuates generation of C3b and C5b-9 on targets (e.g., virions or virus-infected cells). An analogous cleavage of C3 to C3b-like proteins by extracellular gelatinase has been described as a mechanism of complement evasion by Enterococcus faecalis (Park et al., 2008). Our studies do not rule out the possibility that NS1 also inhibits complement activation by independently preventing C4b attachment to target cells. Unlike poxviruses, which express viral virulence factors with structural and functional similarities to human complement regulators (Rosengard et al., 2002), NS1 itself lacks any apparent sequence homology to known complement proteins or enzymes. Interestingly, C4 is the only complement protein that is sulfated on a tyrosine residue, and this posttranslational modification increases the efficiency of C4 cleavage by C1s (Hortin et al., 1989). As DENV NS1 binds sulfated glycosaminoglycans (Avirutnan et al., 2007), it is tempting to speculate that NS1 binding near the sulfated tyrosine on C4 could render it more susceptible to C1s or C1s-like proteases. Investigations with mutant NS1 proteins and C4 lacking sulfation are planned to directly test this hypothesis.",

Several biochemical experiments, however, suggest that the interaction of Flavivirus NS1 with C1s and C4 is specific: (a) YFV NS1, which does not copurify efficiently with hamster C1s, binds C4 but lacks cleavage activity. However, addition of YFV NS1 to limiting quantities of human proC1s and C1s enhances the cleavage rate of C4; (b) WNV, YFV, and DENV NS1 all bind directly to human proC1s and C1s by ELISA; (c) WNV NS1 specifically shifts the size exclusion chromatography profile of human proC1s. Although our data suggest that NS1 promotes cleavage of C4 by recruiting and enhancing the enzymatic activity of C1s, it remains unclear mechanistically how NS1 achieves this. Binding of NS1 to C1s/proC1s may cause structural changes that increase the proteolytic activity of C1s. Alternatively, oligomeric forms of NS1 could bring C4 and C1s together for a sustained interaction that promotes cleavage.",

This discrepancy may be explained by the presence of natural and neutralizing IgM against NS1 and the relative concentrations of NS1 and C4 in serum (comparatively low NS1 and high C4) that could attenuate an inhibitory effect on C4 activation. In peripheral tissues where the majority of Flavivirus infection occurs, higher local levels of NS1 coupled with lower levels of extravascular complement and Ab concentrations could efficiently inhibit C4 function. Flaviviruses, thus, may use NS1 to bind C1s proenzyme produced from the same infected cell or neighboring cells to inactivate C4 in solution. By forming a complex with C1s, NS1 can promote continuous cleavage of C4 to C4b. In solution, this nascently generated C4b would have only a few microseconds to bind to a target before further hydrolysis, as observed with activated C4b. Thus, NS1 targeting of C4 could directly limit opsonization and neutralization of virions and thereby facilitate local dissemination.",

The NS1 antagonism of complement function could explain some of the clinical and pathological findings of severe DENV disease. However, severe dengue disease usually occurs after secondary DENV infection by a different viral serotype. Pre-existing cross-reactive anti-NS1 Abs could modulate (enhance or inhibit) the ability of DENV NS1 to attenuate complement activation during secondary infection. Such an interaction at endothelial or serosal sites could trigger dysfunctional complement responses by NS1-Ab immune complexes that promote fluid extravasation into pleural and peritoneal spaces, a characteristic of DHF/DSS (Nimmannitya, 1987). Alternatively, antagonism of C4 function by NS1 may have a more important role in primary Flavivirus infection by enhancing the infectivity of virus in serum or tissues, which otherwise can be neutralized by complement. An improved understanding of the novel immune evasion mechanisms of Flavivirus NS1 will likely foster insight into the host-pathogen interactions that modulate disease severity.",

DNA templates linearized with XhoI were transcribed in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase using mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. In vitro\u2013transcribed RNA was electroporated into BHK cells with 3 consecutive electrical pulses of 850 V at 25 \u00b5F and \u221e \u03a9 using the Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and double subgenomic infectious viruses were harvested 2 d later. WNV or YFV NS1 was harvested from supernatants of BHK cells infected with 39HK WNV NS1 or 39HK YFV NS1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in serum-free DME at 36 h. Infectious recombinant Sindbis virus was inactivated by \u03b2-propiolactone treatment at 37\u00b0C overnight or NP-40 (0.05% [vol/vol] final concentration) before NS1 purification using a Flavivirus cross-reactive anti-NS1 (9NS1; Chung et al., 2006b) Sepharose 4B column. A two-step purification of Flavivirus NS1 was performed as described previously (Avirutnan et al., 2007) using ion exchange or size exclusion chromatography.",
