Each assay has a number of advantages and disadvantages. CPE assay and plaque assay are widely used and are cost-effective, but relatively time-consuming and have low throughput. Although qPCR assay is a highly specific method, it is expensive and requires preparation of RNA and specific primers for viral factors. ELISA is also a highly specific method, but it requires multiple washing and incubation steps due to the heterogeneous assay conditions. Therefore, a simple, rapid, costeffective, and high-throughput assay is required for basic research and screening of new antiviral agents.",

Moreover, we determined whether the dsRNA-HTRF assay could detect the concentration-and time-dependent signals. Increasing the concentration of poly(I:C) resulted in a significant increase in HTRF signal (Delta F%) (Supplementary Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, these signals increased in a time-dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig. 1C) . In addition, these signals were abolished by dsRNA-specific nuclease RNase III ( Supplementary Fig. 1D ), indicating that these HTRF signals were specifically detected for dsRNA. Accordingly, in further experiments, the reaction conditions of 4\u00b0C for 24 h were used, and serial dilution of poly(I:C) was used as a standard curve to determine the HTRF signal.",

H1-HeLa cells were infected with HRV-B14 at MOI of 10 to achieve single-cycle growth, and viral dsRNA was detected at 6 h post-infection using the dsRNA-HTRF assay ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , indicating that this assay could evaluate the single-cycle growth of HRV-B14. Cytotoxicity was observed at 24 h post-infection at MOI of 10.

In the dsRNA-HTRF assay, rupintrivir inhibited the proliferation of HRV-B14, CV-A21, and EV-D68 with EC 50 of 3.3, 45, and 15, respectively (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Fig. 5A and B).

However, there have been no reports of HTRF assay focused on viral replication. Here we report the first study regarding development of the HTRF assay to detect proliferation of (+) ssRNA viruses. Several anti-dsRNA antibodies are commercially available, which detect multiple (+) ssRNA viruses, e.g., picornaviruses [14] , caliciviruses [15] , coronaviruses [16] , togaviruses [17] , and flaviviruses [18, 19] using immunofluorescence analysis and/ or ELISA. In the present study, we showed that the dsRNA-HTRF assay could detect the proliferation of HRV, CV, EV, and MNV. As most positive-strand RNA viruses produce dsRNA during the replication stage, this assay may be applicable for broad-spectrum detection of other RNA viruses. Further investigations using the dsRNA-HTRF assay are needed to examine the possibility of broad-spectrum detection of RNA viruses, i.e., coronaviruses, togaviruses, and flaviviruses.",

Moreover, HTRF technology is simple, rapid, highly robust, and suitable for highthroughput analyses. Therefore, the dsRNA-HTRF assay may provide a new HTS-compatible strategy for the discovery of novel antiviral agents. Further experiments are needed to determine whether this assay can be optimized and miniaturized to meet HTS requirements for screening compound libraries.",
