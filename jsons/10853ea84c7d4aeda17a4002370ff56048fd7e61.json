Through the integration of the credible multi-source data, we could create connections among the bio-entities, authors, articles, affiliations, and funding. Data validation revealed that the BioBERT deep learning method of bio-entity extraction significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art models based on the F1 score (by 0.51%), with the author name disambiguation (AND) achieving a F1 score of 98.09%. PKG can trigger broader innovations, not only enabling us to measure scholarly impact, knowledge usage, and knowledge transfer, but also assisting us in profiling authors and organizations based on their connections with bio-entities.

The NER task recognizes a variety of domain-specific proper nouns in a biomedical corpus and is perceived as one of the most notable biomedical text mining tasks. In contrast to previous studies that have built models based on long shortterm memory (LSTM) and conditional random fields (CRFs) 12,13 , the recently proposed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) 14 model achieves excellent performance for most of the NLP tasks with minimal task-specific architecture modifications. The transformers applied in BERT connect the encoders and decoders through self-attention for greater parallelization and reduced training time. BERT was designed as a general-purpose language representation model that was pre-trained on English Wikipedia and BooksCorpus. Consequently, it is incredibly challenging to maintain high performance when applying BERT to biomedical domain texts that contain a considerable number of domain-specific proper nouns and terms (e.g., BRCA1 gene and Triton X-100 chemical). BERT required refinement, so BioBERT-a neural network-based high-performance NER model-was developed. Its purpose is to recognize the known biomedical entities and discover new biomedical entities.",

While finetuning BERT (BioBERT), we use WordPiece tokenization 15 to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary issue. WordPiece embedding is a method of dividing a word into several units (e.g., Immunoglobulin divided into I ##mm##uno ##g ##lo ##bul ##in) and expressing each unit. This technique is effective at extracting the features associated with uncommon words. The NER models available in BioBERT can predict the following seven tags: IOB2 tags (i.e., Inside, Outside, and Begin) 16 , X (i.e., a sub-token of WordPiece), [CLS] (i.e., the leading token of a sequence for classification), [SEP] (i.e., a sentence delimiter), and PAD (i.e., a padding of each word in a sentence).

These languages equate to gibberish for laypeople, but for medical minds, they are an intricate method of transporting important semantics and consensus capable of translating diagnoses, medical procedures, and medications among millions of physicians, nurses, and medical researchers, thousands of hospitals, hundreds of pharmacies, and a multitude of health insurance companies. These languages (e.g., genes, drugs, proteins, species, and mutations) are the backbone of quality healthcare. However, they are deeply embedded in publications, making literature searches increasingly onerous because conventional text mining tools and algorithms continue to be ineffective. Given that medical domains are deeply divided, locating collaborators across domains is arduous. For instance, if a researcher wants to study ACE2 gene related to COVID-19, he or she would like to know the following: which researchers are currently actively studying ACE2 gene, what are the related genes, diseases, or drugs discussed in these articles related to ACE2 gene, and with whom could the researcher collaborate? This is a strenuous position to be in, and the aforementioned problems diminish the curiosity directed at the topic.",

            "text": "Many studies have been devoted to building open-access datasets to solve bio-entity recognition problems. For example, Kai et al. 1 used a conditional random field classifier-based tool to recognize the named entities from PubMed and PubMed Central. Bell et al. 2 performed a large-scale integration of a diverse set of bio-entities and their relationships from both bio-entity datasets and PubMed literature. Although these open-access datasets are predominantly about bio-entity recognition, researchers have also been interested in extracting other types of entities and relationships in PubMed, including the mapping of author affiliations to cities and their geocodes 3, 4 , author name disambiguation 5 (AND), and author background information collections 6 . Although the focus of previous research has been on limited types of entities, the goal of our study was to integrate a comprehensive dataset by capturing bio-entities, disambiguated authors, funding, and fine-grained affiliation information from PubMed literature. Figure 1 illustrates the bio-entity integration framework. This framework consists of two parts: (1) bio-entity extraction, which contains entity extraction, named entity recognition (NER), and multi-type normalization, and (2) integration, which connects authors, ORCID, and funding information. The process illustrated in Figure 1 can be described as follows. First, we applied the highperformance deep learning method Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT) 7, 8 to extract bio-entities from 29 million PubMed abstracts. Based on the evaluation, this method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods based on the F1 score (by 0.51%, on average). Then, we integrated two existing highquality author disambiguation datasets: Author-ity 5 and Semantic Scholar 9 . We obtained the disambiguated authors of PubMed articles with full coverage and quality of 98.09% in terms of the F1 score. Next, we integrated additional fields from credible sources into our dataset, which included the projects funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 10 , the affiliation history and educational background of authors from ORCID 6 , and fine-grained region and location information from the MapAffil 2016 dataset 11 . We named this new interlinked dataset \"PubMed Knowledge Graph\" (PKG). PKG is by far the most comprehensive, up-to-date, high-quality dataset for PubMed regarding bio-entities, articles, scholars, affiliations, and funding information. Being an open dataset, PKG contains rich information ready to be deployed,",

However, it is a daunting challenge to build a single normalization tool for multiple entity types because there exist various normalization models that depend on the type of entity. We addressed this issue by combining multiple NER normalization models into one multi-type normalization model that assigns IDs to extracted entities. Table 1 illustrates the statistics of the proposed normalization model. The multi-type normalization model is based on a normalization model per entity type (Table 1) . To improve the number of normalized entities, we added the disease names from the PolySearch2 dictionary (76,001 names of 27,658 diseases) to the sieve-based entity linking dictionary (76,237 names of 11,915 diseases). We also added the drug names from DrugBank 25 and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the tmChem dictionary. Because there are no existing normalization model for species, we normalized species based on dictionary lookup. Using tmVar 2.0, we created a dictionary of mutations with normalized mutation names, in which a mutation with several names was assigned to one normalized name or ID.",

The first type of method relies on manual matching of articles with authors by surveying scientists or consulting curricula vitae (CVs) gathered from the Internet 28 . Although this type of method ensures high accuracy, a considerable amount of investment in labor is required to collect and code the data, which is impractical for huge datasets. The second type of method uses publicly-accessible registry platforms, such as ORCID or Google Scholar, to help researchers identify their own publications, which produces a source of highly accurate and low-cost accessible disambiguation of authorship for large numbers of authors. However, registries cover only a small proportion of researchers 29, 30 , which introduces a form of survivor bias into samples. The third type of method uses an automated approach to estimate the similarity of author instance feature combinations and identify whether they refer to the same person. The features for automated AND include author name, author affiliation, article keywords, journal names 31 , coauthor information 32 , and citation patterns 33 . Automated methods typically rely on supervised or unsupervised machine learning, in which the machine learns how to weigh the various features associated with author names and where to assign a pair of author names either to the same author or to two different authors 34, 35 . This type of method can potentially avoid the shortcomings of the previous two types. Moreover, automated methods have been improved to a high level of accuracy after years of development.",

Affiliations were linked to a specific author on a specific article. Prior to 2014, PubMed only recorded the affiliation of the first author.

Furthermore, approximately 1.15% of the author instances cannot be disambiguated since they do not exist in the Author-ity or Semantic Scholar AND results, which further slightly reduces the performance of AND results theoretically. However, the Semantic Scholar AND results and the AND Integration are evaluated based on the same baseline dataset with Author-ity in this section, and the evaluation of Author-ity performance using a random sample of articles indicates reliable high quality: the recall of the Author-ity dataset is 98.8%, the lumping (putting two different individuals into the same cluster) of the Author-ity dataset affects 0.5% of the clusters, and the splitting (assigning articles written by the same individual to more than one cluster) of the Author-ity dataset affects 2% of the articles 5 .

Several publications and bio-entities were used for profiling the career of Dr. Silberstein. Several publications and the author's distribution were used for profiling CGRP. For bipartite author-entity projection network analysis, we collected 9,778 articles on coronavirus in the PKG dataset from 1969 to 2019.",

As depicted in Figure 4 (a), \"Headache\" and \"migraine\" were his two most studied diseases, reaching 21 and 19 articles, respectively, in 2004. We trended his research over time on triptans, starting with sumatriptan. CGRP began to emerge in his publications starting in 2015. We noted the five researchers that have collaborated with Dr. Silberstein through his career and map with PKG their collaborations, interactions, and institutions over time. Visualizing the profiles of individual researchers can help to understand the trends in their topics of interest and collaboration patterns to enable an understanding of collaboration factors that may be associated with academic success or scientific discovery. As we demonstrated with a previous analysis of the repurposing of Aspirin 66-67 , we observe research on CGRP starting at approximately the same time as the research on triptans for the treatment of migraines. Research on the pathophysiology of migraines identified a central role of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is thought to be involved with the dilation of cerebral and dural blood vessels, release of inflammatory mediators, and the transmission of pain signals 68 . Research on the mechanism of the action of triptansserotonin receptor agonists-has led to an understanding that they normalize elevated CGRP levels, which among other mechanisms, has led to an improvement in migraine headache symptoms. Consequently, papers in high-impact journals have called for identifying molecules and the development of drugs to directly inhibit CGRP 69 , which has since led to the development of CGRP inhibitors as a new class of migraine treatment medications.",

Figure 5 illustrated the bipartite network ( Figure 5(a) ) and its author projection ( Figure 5(b) ) and bio-entity projection ( Figure  5 (c)). In Figure 5(a) , the author vertices are blue, and the bio-entity vertices are pink. A link between a bio-entity and an author exists if and only if this bio-entity has been researched by that author. Connections between two authors or between two bio-entities are not allowed. The edge weight is set as the number of papers an author published that mention a bio-entity. In Figure 5 (b) and 5(c), the edge weight is set as the number of common neighbors for the author and bio-entity, respectively. Vertices are marked with different colors to show their community attribution. For example, the disease SARS have been frequently studied by author Baric R S, Yuen Kwok-Yung, and Zheng Bo-Jian. In addition to SARS, Baric R S is also interested in coronavirus infection and HBV infection. Figure 5 (b) depicts the common research interest relationship between authors. Strong connections between authors may indicate that they collaborated multiple times, such as Chan Kwok Hung and Yuen Kwok-Yung, who published 69 papers together. These connections may also indicate author pairs that have similar research interests but never collaborated, such as Baric R S and Yuen Kwok-Yung, which is crucial for the collaborative commendation. Similarly, those connections between bio-entities in Figure 5 (c) indicate that they have been studied by authors with similar research interests, which can be further applied to discover the hidden relations between bio-entities.",
