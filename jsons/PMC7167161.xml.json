The algorithms in the first group calculate a matrix representing the distance between each pair of sequences and then transform this matrix into a tree. In the second type of approaches, instead of building a tree, the tree that can best explain the observed sequences under the evolutionary assumption is found by evaluating the fitness of different topologies. For example, Jukes and Cantor,7 Kimura,8 Barry and Hartigan,9 Kishino and Hasegawa,10 and Lake11 proposed various distance measures. Camin and Sokal,12 Eck and Dayhoff,13 Cavalli\u2010Sforza and Edwards,14 and Fitch15 gave parsimony methods. Felsenstein et al.16, 17, 18 proposed maximum likelihood methods.",

In addition to problems in multiple alignment (computational complexity and inherent ambiguity of the alignment cost criteria), these methods become insufficient for phylogenies using complete genomes. Multiple alignment become misleading due to gene rearrangement, inversion, transposition, and translocation at the substring level, unequal length of sequences, etc, and statistical evolutionary models are yet to be suggested for complete genomes. On the other hand, whole genome\u2010based phylogenic analyses are appearing because single gene sequences generally do not possess enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms. Factors such as different rates of evolution and horizontal gene transfer make phylogenetic analysis of species using single gene sequences difficult.",

These techniques provide useful insights into local and global characteristics and the occurrences, variations, and repetition of the nucleotides along a sequence that are not as easily obtainable by other methods.29, 33 Based on these graphical representation several authors outlined some approaches to make comparison of DNA sequences34, 35, 36, 37, 38.
