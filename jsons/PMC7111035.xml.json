However, the main proteinase of SARS coronavirus (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) has a good chance to catch up. When the first three-dimensional structure of a coronavirus Mpro was published in 2002, that of the enzyme from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [2], interest in the coronaviridae was only moderate, since these viruses were considered relatively harmless to human health. This assessment changed dramatically in late March, 2003, when it was found that the ongoing global outbreak of the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome was caused by a new coronavirus, subsequently named SARS-CoV. Since then, efforts to discover anti-SARS drugs have been numerous, in order to be prepared should the virus raise its ugly head again.",

Most coronaviruses have three cysteine proteinases that are responsible for this processing: two papain-like proteinases and the main proteinase, Mpro. Interestingly, one of the two papain-like proteinases is absent in the SARS coronavirus, and the other one has been shown to have the additional function of a deubiquitinating enzyme 3, 4. While the papain-like proteinases together are only responsible for three cleavage reactions near the N terminus of the polyproteins, the Mpro cleaves these huge substrates (molecular masses of 450\u2013750 kDa) at no less than 11 sites. Since this reaction is essential for viral replication, the main proteinase is obviously a prime target for interference by inhibitors [5].",

            "text": "The new contribution from the same group, presented in this issue [1], originated from an attempt to improve the inhibitory properties of lopinavir. The authors assembled a library of lopinavir-like compounds by coupling an amine or a 1,4-diamine with various acids in microtiter plates, followed by screening in situ. O-(Benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) was used as a coupling reagent. Several lopinavir derivatives showed somewhat improved binding affinities, but it came as a big surprise that some of the intermediate benzotriazole esters resulting from the activation of the acid components by HBTU were nanomolar inhibitors of the Mpro! Thus, we have the remarkable case here of a reaction intermediate being a highly active inhibitor of a target enzyme. Next, the authors synthesized a series of benzotriazole esters (Figure 1F) by condensation of HBTU with various aromatic carboxylic acids and found that compounds carrying electron-donating substituents were strong irreversible inhibitors of the Mpro, with a Ki of 21.0 nM for the best derivative. Using mass spectrometry, Wu et al. showed that the compounds acted by acylating the catalytic cysteine residue of the Mpro. Further, they also demonstrated that the benzotriazole derivatives were non-toxic to Vero E6 cells, the standard cells used in anti-SARS-CoV assays, at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM [1].",

In their paper, Wu et al. [1] also describe benzotriazole ester surrogates that have the ester oxygen replaced by a methylene group and are thus not susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the active site cysteine. Some of these compounds (such as 14, 17, and 18; see Scheme 3 of Wu et al. [1]) are competitive inhibitors with Ki values in the lower micromolar range and are thus among the most potent noncovalent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV Mpro described to date. The discovery of compounds binding noncovalently to the Mpro may, in the end, constitute a more important milestone on the way to clinically useful inhibitors of the coronavirus main proteinase than identification of the acylating agents.",
