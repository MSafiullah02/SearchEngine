They infect a wide range of mammals and cause a spectrum of diseases of various severities. In humans, CoV have caused diseases ranging from the common cold-like (caused by human CoV 229E, NL63, HKU1, and OC43) to severe respiratory diseases caused by \u03b2-coronaviruses like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1 (SARS-1 in the text) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Given that the causative agent of the current coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2 in the text) is much more similar to its two highly pathogenic cousins than to the common cold-like coronaviruses; we will liberally use these two coronaviruses as points of reference throughout the text.",

Canonical structure of SARS-1 genome, as a representative of the Sarbecovirus family, includes a large 5\u2019 open reading frame (ORF) 1ab, which takes up two-thirds of the genome and encodes two polyproteins that contains 16 nonstructural enzymes critical for viral replication. The 3\u2019 third of the genome encodes structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleoprotein) and interspersed among them the ORFs encoding nonstructural and accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8 (or 8a and 8b in some isolates). Accessory proteins play a role in immune evasion and inflammation, including inhibition of type I interferons (3b and 6), induction of apoptosis (3a, 3b, 8a), modulation of cellular DNA synthesis (6, 8b), induction of arms of unfolded protein response (8), stimulation of chemokine synthesis (3a, stimulates chemokine ligand 5, CCL5; and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8, CXCL8), and inflammation (7, activates inflammation via NF-kB and MAPK-8) (Luk et al. 2019; de Wit et al. 2016; Brian and Baric 2005). SARS-2 belongs to the same Sarbecovirus lineage and maintains the overall structure detailed above for SARS-1. However, SARS-2 exhibits high homology to recent bat CoV isolate RaTG13, with 97\u201399% homology at ORF1ab, N and S proteins, and only 71\u201375% homology to other SARS-1-related CoV, 80% to SARS-1, and 50% to MERS-CoV, suggesting direct evolution from the specific lineage of bat CoV and not SARS-1 (Li et al. 2020a). This is further supported by a single ns8 gene, typical of bat CoVs (Luk et al. 2019; Li et al. 2020a). SARS-2 is also showing mutations in patients (Li et al. 2020a; Zhao et al. 2020), suggesting further adaptation to its (relatively new) human hosts, although coronaviruses mutate less frequently than some other RNA viruses, due to the presence of a proofreading exonuclease, encoded by the nsp14 in the long ORF. Intense research is ongoing to target different components of the SARS-2 and coronaviruses in general using antiviral drugs.",

Subsequent to this outbreak, SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) were isolated from horseshoe bats in the Guangdong province, leading to identification of bats as the natural reservoir of SARS-1r-CoV and, subsequently, a source of SARS-2. Initial theory that palm civet cats were the source of SARS-1 was abandoned in light of strong evidence that civets themselves got infected in live animal markets (Luk et al. 2019). SARS-1 affected 32 countries over a span of 9 months, with 8096 laboratory-confirmed cases and 774 deaths (mortality rate of nearly 10%). MERS-CoV was first described in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Zaki et al. 2012). MERS has been found in 27 countries, dominantly in the Middle East, and it remains endemic in many of them due to the presence of camels, believed to be a natural reservoir of a closely related virus. As of November 2019, MERS has caused 858 deaths out of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases (mortality rate of 33%).",

It dwarfed both of its highly pathogenic cousins by the number of cases, highlighting very efficient human-to-human spread (rev. in (Rothan and Byrareddy 2020)) as well as asymptomatic spread (Bai et al. 2020) possibly due to the persistence of the virus as aerosol and on various surfaces (van Doremalen et al. 2020). Due to the high extent of spread, the overall mortality of COVID-19 is already higher by more than an order of magnitude than either SARS or MERS, although current (incomplete and insufficiently reliable) data suggest somewhat lower mortality rates, that appear to range between 0.5\u20138%, depending on the availability of diagnostic testing and capacity of the healthcare system. The vast majority of deaths are in adults aged 60 and above. In this short review, we will address the essential pathological, clinical, and geriatric features of SARS-2; the immune response to pathogenic CoV; and a prospective summary on what to expect and how to protect older adults from SARS-2 by using various clinical, public health, and immunological strategies.",

The largest number of confirmed cases is from China, where the first reported cases were identified in the city of Wuhan in the late November of 2019 (Wang et al. 2020b). Investigations tracking initial confirmed cases indicated that a cluster of patients had been associated with a local food market in this city. Reports of infection then occurred in South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan. Initial reports from these countries showed recent travel or close contact to patients that had traveled to China. This was followed by local spread from person to person (Guan et al. 2020). To date, China has more than 80,000 confirmed infections but has largely stemmed the surge using drastic social distancing measures and has experienced more imported than community-spread cases in the last 3 weeks. Italy has experienced some of the highest death rates, in line with having the second oldest population worldwide, and both Italy and the USA are expected to surpass China by total confirmed infections before April. Indeed, cases have now been identified in countries across all continents, and new cases are being reported at increasing rates compared with China.",

Studies have shown the virus survives in different surfaces for days and remains viable in aerosols for hours (van Doremalen et al. 2020). It is thought that person to person transmission of droplets is the main way the virus spreads, followed by aerosol and fomite transmission. It is possible that transmission occurs via fecal-oral route. Transmission of virus from asymptomatic patients has been reported, with high titers of viral load on pharyngeal samples of minimally symptomatic patients during the initial days of the disease. This is different compared with SARS and MERS, where infectivity peaks relatively later during symptomatic infection, and may account for a much larger spread of COVID-19. Still, the highest transmission rates have been reported to correlate with disease severity and are particularly pronounced in hospital settings, just like for SARS and MERS. Median incubation period is thought to be 5.1 days, while onset of symptoms has been reported up to 14 days after exposure(Lauer et al. 2020), providing basis for the length of quarantine/self-isolation.",

In humans, for SARS-1 and 2, this entry occurs via the host cell surface enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This interaction is so critically important that the human-adapted SARS-CoV infects mice poorly or not at all unless the human molecule is introduced into the mouse as a transgene (McCray et al. 2007). Indeed, molecular evolution of SARS-2 suggests that the bat virus evolved to infect humans by mutating precisely the part of the S glycoprotein necessary for receptor binding. Some other mutations have been hypothesized to be stabilizing to the virus (Angeletti et al. 2020), but it is unclear whether this relates to environmental stability and persistence on surfaces or to other parameters of stability. MERS-CoV utilizes CD26, or dipeptidyl peptidase 4, for cellular entry (de Wit et al. 2016). After the membrane fusion, viral RNA genome is uncoated and begins the translation of the long ORF, transcription of subgenomic RNAs and viral replication and assembly with structural proteins, followed by budding via the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment and release via plasma membrane fusion (rev. in (de Wit et al. 2016)).",

            "text": "Of the three viruses, SARS-1 is best understood with regard to pathogenesis. Following viral entry, ACE2 is downregulated, which paradoxically enhances pathology, because the presence of ACE2 has been shown to be protective against acute lung injury (Imai et al. 2005). Specifically, downregulation of ACE2 leads to compensatory overproduction of angiotensin II by ACE. Angiotensin II in turn stimulates its type 1a receptor, which increases lung vascular permeability and potentiates lung pathology (rev. in (de Wit et al. 2016)) . Therefore, both the initial and most serious prolonged injury occurs to the lungs. While the immune response is critical for the resolution of SARS-1 infection, it can also potentiate, if not drive, pathogenesis in the second phase of the disease (de Wit et al. 2016), with a paradoxical observation that viral loads often decline when the severity of the disease increases. It is not clear whether MERS follows the same course. Progression to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS-1 has been indeed marked by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, particularly interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-8, IL-6, CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). In fact, retrospective analysis of survivors versus non-survivors revealed an early and sustained pattern of innate immune activation and soluble mediator elevation in non-survivors, most notably IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b3, CXCL10 and CCL2, and the downstream interferon-stimulated genes (SIG), without ever progressing to production of significant amounts of antibodies. Survivors, by contrast, exhibited the expected switch to antibody production (Cameron et al. 2008; Cameron et al. 2007). Thus, one could describe the unsuccessful immune response to SARS as \u201cstuck in innate immunity,\u201d whereas the progression to adaptive immunity, with antibody production, strongly correlated with favorable outcomes. Studies in collaborative cross (CC) mice have so far identified a host gene Trim55 (encoding a microtubule, myosin, and titin-associated protein) as important for SARS pathogenesis; mice not possessing this molecule exhibited less lung pathology (Gralinski et al. 2015).",

Older men and men with comorbidities are at highest risk for severe disease (Huang et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020b). Mild disease may resolve without medical care or may progress to pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring hospitalization. Patients may rapidly progress to ARDS with multi-organ dysfunction and death. Leukopenia and lymphopenia are frequently noted (Huang et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020b). SARS-2 may exhibit neuroinvasiveness that could affect the clinical presentation (Li et al. 2020b). Most common radiographic abnormalities on CT scan are bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidation in a peripheral, posterior, and lower lobe distribution (Zu et al. 2020). Similar to SARS, a histological case of a patient who died from SARS-2 infection showed diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, consistent with ARDS. In contrast to peripheral lymphopenia seen in many patients, interstitial lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates were noted (Xu et al. 2020). Some patients who recover from their pneumonia have pulmonary limitations of yet to be determined etiology. It is unclear whether older adults are disproportionately affected long term.",

For coronaviruses, the key pattern recognition receptors are (1) Toll-like receptor 7, which is activated by RNA in endosomes (Cervantes-Barragan et al. 2007; Sheahan et al. 2008); (2) RIG-I and MDA-5, which recognize cytosolic viral RNA that is double-stranded, contain a 5\u2019-triphosphate group, and/or lack a 5\u2019 methyl cap (Zust et al. 2011); and (3) the cGAS-STING pathway, which recognizes cytosolic DNA (Sun et al. 2012). The latter of these three groups of sensors does not directly sense material from RNA viruses but rather is likely activated by cellular damage and mitochondrial DNA release caused by viral infection (Sun et al. 2017). Upon activation, these pattern recognition sensors initiate a signaling cascade that leads to expression of type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN in turn induces an antiviral state by inducing key interferon-stimulated genes that limit viral replication through a variety of mechanisms (Schneider et al. 2014). For coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, the timing of type I IFN production appears to dictate the outcome of infection in mouse models (Channappanavar et al. 2019). An early burst of type I IFN leads to protection. In contrast, a delay in IFN production causes an inability to control viral replication, leading to cellular damage of airway epithelia and the lung parenchyma and an eventual lethal inflammatory cytokine storm. The latter response often predominates in older individuals and in aged mouse models of SARS-1 infection (Rockx et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2005). Unsurprisingly, coronaviruses have evolved multiple immune evasion mechanisms to limit the early induction of type I IFN. For example, SARS-1 encodes an enzyme that adds a 2\u2019 O-methyl group to viral RNA, thereby evading detection by MDA-5 (Decroly et al. 2008; Zust et al. 2011). Similarly, coronaviruses encode proteases that antagonize STING (Sun et al. 2012). Though studies are just beginning, it seems almost certain that SARS-2 possesses similar evasion mechanisms.",

Both CD8+ T cells, which recognize peptides bound to HLA-I, and CD4+ T lymphocytes, which recognize peptide:HLA-II, are critical for viral clearance in mouse models of SARS-CoV-1 infection (Chen et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). Once primed, CD8+ T cells become competent to kill virally infected cells, whereas CD4+ cells produce factors to help B cells and antibody responses as well as enhance CD8+ T cell function. Contemporaneously, B cells also become activated by cognate viral antigens through their antibody receptors. In canonical antibody responses, B cells require help from CD4+ T cells to generate germinal centers, engage in somatic hypermutation and antibody affinity maturation, and yield immunological memory. This memory is composed of cells that respond more quickly than do their na\u00efve precursors to subsequent infections and of long-lived plasma cells that constitutively secrete antibodies. Because these antibodies preexist subsequent exposures and can provide sterilizing immunity, this humoral response is usually the best correlate of subsequent immunological protection to a variety of pathogens (Zinkernagel 2002). For this reason, vaccine efforts usually focus on eliciting an effective neutralizing antibody response that prevents infection.",

By analogy, most initial efforts to generate subunit vaccines against SARS-2 have also focused on the corresponding S protein and its receptor-binding domain. This effort may prove to be more difficult for SARS-2 than for SARS-1. The affinity of SARS-2 S protein for its receptor ACE2 is approximately 15 nM\u2014over 20 times tighter binding than that observed by SARS-1 S protein (Wrapp et al. 2020; Yan et al. 2020). This exceptionally tight binding approaches that of many antibodies and usually only those that have been through a prolonged affinity maturation process. Intriguingly, other neutralizing antibodies cross-react between SARS-1 and SARS-2 and appear to bind the S protein core rather than the receptor-binding domain (ter Meulen et al. 2006; Tian et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020a). The mechanism of neutralization remains to be determined, but these preliminary data suggest that targets aside from the receptor-binding domain of S protein, including perhaps other SARS-2 proteins of as yet unknown significance, may warrant additional attention as vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "Age-related changes begin early in life with the drop in production of new T cells. New na\u00efve T cells are made in the thymus, a gland above the heart that is large in our childhood, but undergoes quick atrophy, called involution, so that already by the end of puberty, we get only 10% of production that we had as kids (Chinn et al. 2012). Another drop in production occurs between 40 and 50 years of age, reducing new production of na\u00efve T cells to 1% (Naylor et al. 2005). A similar drop in production of na\u00efve B cells occurs due to an age-related dysfunction of the bone marrow (the site of B cell generation), although this occurs later in life than for T cells (Chinn et al. 2012). Na\u00efve T and B cells made in youth are normally maintained for long periods of time in the lymph nodes (and to a lesser degree in the spleen and bone marrow for B cells). In fact, lymph nodes are in charge of both maintenance and coordination of new immune responses necessary to control viruses such as SARS-2. Lymph nodes undergo dramatic age-related changes in the final third of life, becoming less able to maintain na\u00efve T cells (Thompson et al. 2017) and to coordinate new immune responses to emerging infections Moreover, the T cells that do remain do not move quickly enough to meet innate immune cells when the infection strikes (Richner et al. 2015), which could be a consequence of dysregulation in chemokines that guide T cell migration. Innate immune cells themselves do not get activated by infection as efficiently in mice (Li et al. 2012) and humans (Metcalf et al. 2015). Once activated, both T and B cells exhibit reduced proliferation and differentiation in lymph nodes with aging. As a consequence, the immune responses to a new emerging infection are blunted, with many fewer effector cells, that are also less well armed by antimicrobial molecules, making them less effective in defending against infection as we age (Brien et al. 2009; Smithey et al. 2011).",

Moreover, as mentioned in the section on pathogenesis, it appears that unsuccessful responses to SARS-1 (Cameron et al. 2008; Cameron et al. 2007) (and possibly SARS-2) do not properly progress in a coordinated and effective fashion from an innate to an adaptive immune response in older adults. If so, it is to be expected that this problem will be exacerbated in older adults, where the communication between innate and adaptive immunity is known to be compromised already (Richner et al. 2015; Li et al. 2012). Studies are urgently needed to evaluate specific facets of immune dysfunction and virus (immune) pathogenesis in older adults, but all of this would be expected to result in increased morbidity and mortality in our older populations.",

Their validation and therapeutic/toxicity assessment is ahead of us. On the immune side, vaccine candidates are currently under clinical testing. Regardless of which candidates emerge as best for vaccine development, any final strategy will have to take into account that the most vulnerable population, the older adults, will also be the most difficult to protect by a vaccine. Indeed, it is well known that aging-related immune defects drastically reduce the responsiveness of older adults to vaccination (Nikolich-Zugich 2018). An extremely encouraging recent development, however, is the success of the second-generation shingles vaccine against the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in older adults (Shingrix on the US market). This vaccine contains two innate immune agonists to stimulate inflammation and cytokine release, and a single glycoprotein from VZV, and has shown > 97% efficacy in people over 65 years of age (Lal et al. 2015). It is imperative that similar strategies be incorporated in the initial design and refinement of the future vaccine against SARS-2.",

            "text": "The following key points emerge from the above discussion as conclusions and questions to be addressed:SARS-2 has emerged as an exceptionally hardy and contagious virus.The brunt of its pathology is shouldered by older adults, for reasons incompletely understood.Current successful anti-pandemic measures have included extensive testing, contact tracking, and quarantining; where that was delayed or impossible, drastic and widespread efforts enforcing social isolation were effective.Prevention is the most important strategy for older adults; the added strain of social distancing on this vulnerable population should be acknowledged and managed.Fever and pulmonary symptoms predominate; cough and dyspnea may resolve or progress to a multifocal pneumonia with characteristic radiographic findings.Patients with severe disease may succumb to ARDS; regardless of disease severity, supportive care is the mainstay of therapy.Older adults often present atypically, employ a low threshold for suspicion and testing, and manage in alignment with patients\u2019 goals of care.Coronaviruses are recognized by TLR7, RIG-I/MDA, and cGAS/STING innate immune sensors; all result in early IFN-I responses necessary for control of infection.Neutralizing antibodies directed at the spike (S) protein binding site for the ACE2 receptor are likely key to protection, although the much higher affinity of SARS-2 S protein for ACE2 (relative to SARS-1) may pose a challenge.Immune responses in older adults are slower, less coordinated, and less efficient, making older adults more susceptible to emerging infectionsThere is evidence that immune responses to SARS-1 and suggestion that responses to SARS-2, in our most vulnerable patients, do not effectively switch from innate to adaptive (little to no antibody production) immunity, a topic needing immediate study and offering potential for immune modulation.Future vaccination strategies will need to elicit strong protective antibody responses in older adults, using age-appropriate adjuvants; anti-viral and immunomodulatory treatments are currently an area of intense study.",
