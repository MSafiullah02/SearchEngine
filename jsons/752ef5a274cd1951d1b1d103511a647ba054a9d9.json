Several reports have described resistance of Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 knock-out (KO) mice to IAV infection but IAV of the H2 subtype have not been examined yet. Here, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is able to cleave H2-HA in cell culture and that Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to infection with a re-assorted PR8_HA(H2) virus. Infection of KO mice did not cause major body weight loss or death. Furthermore, no significant increase in lung weights and no virus replication were observed in Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Finally, only minor tissue damage and infiltration of immune cells were detected and no viruspositive cells were found in histological sections of Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In summary, our studies indicate that TMPRSS2 is required for H2 IAV spread and pathogenesis in mice. These findings extend previous results pointing towards a central role of TMPRSS2 in IAV infection and validate host proteases as a potential target for antiviral therapy.",

For this, HA binds to cellular receptors and fuses the viral membrane with a target cell membrane. HA is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule, HA 0 , and needs to be processed by host proteases into the subunits HA 1 and HA 2 in order to acquire membrane fusion competence [1] [2] [3] [4] . It has been shown previously that the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is required for cleavage of HA of subtypes H1, H7 and H10 in infected mice [5] [6] [7] [8] . TMPRSS2 cleaves these HAs at a single monobasic cleavage site [2, 3, 9] . Here, we demonstrate that also the HA from H2 IAV subtypes requires processing by TMPRSS2 in vivo for virus replication and pathogenesis.",

Transfection of empty plasmid served as negative control while treatment of HA expressing cells with trypsin served as positive control. As shown in Fig. 1 , trypsin and TMPRSS2 cleaved HA, as determined by the detection of the HA cleavage product HA 1 . The slight differences in the size of the HA 1 bands produced by TMPRSS2 relative to trypsin have been documented previously and reflect differences in Nglycosylation of HA 1 [11] .",

In this way, results were independent of other gene segments from the donor bird virus and comparable to other studies in which the HA segment was exchanged and tested on an isogenic PR8 background [8] . For the generation of the PR8_HA(H2) virus, the HA encoding segment 4 from the avian virus was cloned by sequence and ligation independent cloning as described earlier [12] into plasmid pHW-2000 (kindly provided by Robert Webster, St. Jude, Memphis, USA) using primers 5\u2032-gacctcc-gaagttgggggggAGCAAAAGCAGGGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ttttgggccgccgggttattAGTAGAAACAAGGGTGTTTT-3\u2032. Re-assorted virus was then rescued from plasmids as described earlier [13] with 300 ng of each plasmid, 7.5 \u03bcl TransIT-2020 (Mirus) in 250 \u03bcl OptiMEM (Gibco) using the H2 encoding plasmid and plasmids containing all other seven segments of PR8 (kindly provided by Robert Webster, St. Jude, Memphis, USA). The resulting virus PR8_HA(H2) virus was propagated in the chorioallantoic cavity of 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories, Germany) for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. Virus RNA was extracted, and quality and integrity were controlled using Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies; Waldbronn, Germany). A sequencing library was generated from 100 ng total RNA using TotalScript RNA-Seq Kit (epicentre) without fragmentation, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The libraries were then sequenced on Illumina MiSeq using MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles, paired end runs) and the correct sequence of the re-assortant virus was confirmed. The titer of the stock viruses was determined by focus forming unit (ffu) assay [12] .",

For immunohistochemical detection of infected cells, a primary antibody against IAV nucleoprotein (EBS-I- 238, European Veterinary Laboratory) and a secondary HRP-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotech) were used [8] .

Statistics for (c) and (d) were calculated by Mann Whitney Tests (** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001) SDS-PAGE, blotted on a PVDF-membrane (Bio-Rad), which was then incubated with an anti-H2N2 polyclonal antibody (Sino Biological, 11,688-RP02, HB04DE2907-B) using a dilution of 1:5000 in TBST with 0.1% milk powder and then with an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma, A0545) in a dilution of 1:100,000. As a reference (internal control) for total viral particles in a sample, we used the viral NP protein. If such a signal is present, viral particles have been produced and viral proteins can be detetcted. Detection of signals was performed using the FujiFilm LAS-3000 imaging system. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with an anti-NP antibody (GeneTex, GTX125989) in a dilution of 1:10,000, followed by and leukocytes (arrowhead) were found in WT mice, whereas no immunostaining was detectable in Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (see inserts). b Necrotic bronchioli were determined as percentage of total cells. c Semi quantitative scoring results of cellular infiltration (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). d IAV antigen positive cells were counted twice in 10 randomly selected high power fields (10 \u00d7 0.0625 mm 2 ). Bars indicate mean values +/\u2212 SEM. One-sample t-tests were used for statistical analysis (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01). Please note that all values are identical for WT in the inflammation score (error bar is zero) incubation with the same secondary antibody as before. In the BAL of infected WT mice, both HA 1 and HA 2 were detectable (Fig. 4) . Also, a very faint HA 0 band was detectable in Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice after image enhancement (Fig. 4b) . The NP band was much less intense in Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT mice and only clearly detectable after image enhancement (Fig. 4a, b) . Nevertheless, the presence of NP demonstrated that viral particles were present in the samples from Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice that HA 0 was detected but no cleaved HA 1 . Of note, a band of the size of HA 2 was observed in BAL of Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice that was also detectable in mock infected lung at approximately the same intensity. Thus, this band in Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice is unspecific and not representing HA 2 . Taken together, these results are consistent with the observed absence of PR8_HA(H2) (H2N1) replication in Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Since no viral replication and only minor immune responses were detected in the studies described above, we confirmed that mice had indeed been infected with the PR8_HA(H2) virus by determining the presence of H2-specific antibodies at 14 dpi in the serum. For this, female mice were infected with 2 \u00d7 10 4 ffu PR8_HA(H2). At 14 dpi, sera from infected and PBS mock-treated mice were prepared and analyzed for the presence of IAV-specific antibodies. 96-well plates were coated with 5 \u00d7 10 4 ffu PR8_HA(H2) viruses ml \u2212 1 , diluted in 1 x PBS (phosphate buffered saline), incubated overnight, washed with PBST (1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween20), and blocked with PBST-FCS (PBST, 5% v/v fetal calf serum). Fifty \u03bcl of 1:150 diluted mouse serum was added and incubated for 2 hours (h) at 37\u00b0C. Plates were then washed three times with PBST and 50 \u03bcl of anti-mouse IgG (goat anti-mouse IgG heavy chain gamma-HRP, KPL #474-1802), diluted 1:1000 in PBST-FCS, were added and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Wells were then washed three times with PBST and 50 \u03bcl of substrate (SureBlue TMB Peroxidase Substrate, KPL, #52-00-00) was added. After 3 minutes, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl TMB Stop Solution (KPL, #50-85-04) and the optical density was measured at 450 nm. Our studies showed that infected Tmprss2 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a significant seroconversion that was similar to infected WT mice (Fig. 5) . Thus, incoming virus was able to infect lung cells and trigger an immune response but was not able to spread and replicate to levels detectable in ffu assays. It may be worth noting that in mouse lungs, Tmprss2 gene expression is down-regulated at the transcriptional level after infection [16] .",

Moreover, our studies in cell cultures showed that HA can be cleaved by TMPRSS2 and there is at present no evidence that TMPRSS2 can promote IAV spread by other means than HA cleavage.
