It becomes a substantial information source for response and recovery [28] and for grassroots management in relief activities [10, 27]. Invaluable efforts have been made to utilize social media for preparedness, relief, and recovery during natural disasters and after they are over [11]. However, the current automatic solutions require human intervention in many stages due to many challenges. Among these challenges is the lack of geographical context that is important for response and relief. For example, during a disaster, responders need to locate the incidents (e.g., road closures, infrastructure damage, etc.) as they happen, tweets, and users discussing the disaster. However, people often tend to hide their geographical information due to privacy and safety concerns [16, 22]. Anderson et al. [12] analysed tweet disaster datasets that span over a period of 6 years and showed only around 2% or less of the tweets are geo-referenced. Thus, developing automatic geolocation tools would enable real-time location-aware monitoring of the disaster which makes the decision-making process more reliable, effective, and efficient.",

The problem involves two tasks that can be tackled separately or jointly: (1) Location Recognition: extracting the location mentions in tweets, and (2) Location Disambiguation: locating potential location mentions on the map. The Disambiguation task includes two identification sub-tasks: (2.1.) identifying the intended location from a set of location mentions sharing the same toponym. (2.2.) identifying the locational focus of a tweet containing different location mentions. Learning to predict the location mentions is a non-trivial task. The location taggers have to address many challenges including microblogging-specific challenges (e.g., tweet sparsity, noisiness, stream rapid-changing, hashtag riding, etc.) and the task-specific challenges (e.g., time-criticality of the solution, scarcity of labeled data, etc.). While tackling these challenges, I aim to address several research questions including: RQ1. Are deep learning approaches more effective compared to the state-of-the-art and traditional machine learning-based LMP approaches?, RQ2. Would context expansion (using user\u2019s tweets, on-topic tweets, etc) improve LMP?, RQ3. How can we reduce the effect of the scarcity of labeled data on the performance of the LMP system?, and RQ4. How can the LMP systems control the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency during crisis scenarios?.",

[18] compared a few NER tools on disaster-related Twitter data and found their performance noticeably degraded over the Twitter stream. Li et al. [14], on the other hand, constructed their own noisy gazetteer using a crowdsourcing-like method to match extracted location mentions from tweets by the POI tagger. Malmasi et al. [19] extracted noun phrases (NPs) in tweets using a recursive rule-based tree parser and link potential locations with Geonames entries using fuzzy matching. Ghahremanlou et al. [7] explored combined techniques to identify the location mentions by both matching and StafordNER. The major weakness in gazetteer-based methods is the mismatch between the noisy Twitter stream and non-noisy gazetteer entries [17]. To address this issue, Li et al. [15], constructed their own noisy gazetteer using collected cross-posts on Twitter from Foursquare check-ins. Alternatively, Sultanik and Fink [25], used Information Retrieval (IR) based approach to identify the location mentions in tweets. Unlike Ghahremanlou et al. [7], Yin et al. [29] retrained StandfordNER using tweet dataset to effectively identify the location mentions in tweets. More interestingly, to achieve high coverage of recognized locations, a couple of studies [6, 30] adopt an ensemble-based parser.",

[1] proposed identifying the location names by traversing a tree of the tweet\u2019s n-grams to extract valid locations that exist in their pre-build region-specific gazetteer. Moreover, Hoang and Mothe [8] combined syntactic and semantic features to train traditional ML-based models whereas Kumar and Singh [13] trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that learns the continuous representation of tweet text and then identifies the location mentions.",

I plan to use general-purpose KBs and study the effectiveness of knowledge-base population and acceleration techniques to maintain an online up-to-date KBs during the disaster.",

I plan to leverage one-step domain adaptation techniques (e.g., divergence-based, etc.), (2) Acquiring cheaper data: I plan to explore the effectiveness of expanding the small labeled datasets of a current disaster using semi-supervision, weak supervision and active learning methods, and (3) Reusing pre-trained tools: I plan to study the effectiveness of already-trained tools (based on their availability) on old disasters for effective LMP on new disasters (e.g., transfer learning).",

When a system manages to extract part of the location mention, it is penalized by counting the false positives and false negatives multiplied by the percentage of overlap between the system\u2019s output and the ground-truth. To conduct the initial evaluation, the publicly-available LMP English datasets, that are samples of disaster-specific streams [1, 21, 29], will be used. I anticipate the solutions to generalize to other data domains sharing the same properties with the Twitter stream. The Geonames1 and OpenStreetMap2 gazetteers will be utilized for the evaluation of the Disambiguation task. The approaches reviewed in Sect. 2, according to their availability and reproducibility, are the baselines against the proposed approaches for all tasks: (1) Twitter-based location mention detection and disambiguation tool (e.g., LNEx [1]), (2) Academic NER (e.g., StanfordNER3, etc.), and (3) Commercial NER taggers (e.g., Google NL4, etc.).",
