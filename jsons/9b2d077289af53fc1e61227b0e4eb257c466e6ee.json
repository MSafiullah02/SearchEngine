Considering the secondary school environment, no evidence-based requirements could be found for the development of a digital moderation system. This finding provides the rationale for this investigation into the requirements for an efficient eModeration system for IT and CAT assessments at grade 12 level in South Africa (SA). This study draws on eModeration literature as well as technology adoption literature to identify a set of preadoption eModeration requirements against the background of the challenges and benefits of eModeration. The research design involved a single exploratory case study with IT and CAT moderators as units of analysis. Qualitative data analysis using Atlas.ti V8 was conducted on the 61 responses received from an online survey and 4 responses received from a focus group interview. The findings confirmed the absence of customized eModeration systems. The main contribution is the eModeration requirements identified from literature and then refined by triangulation with the empirical findings of the survey. The research has practical value in guiding the design of eModeration systems for the school environment.",

Van Staden [2] describes eModeration as an electronic quality assurance process using an online tool. The New Zealand Qualifications' Authority established the Digital Moderation Project for completing all external moderation online [3] . The objective was to submit assessments via an online digital platform by providing an application to support moderation practices [4] . However, there is no evidence of the successful implementation nor the efficacy of such a system within the New Zealand educational system.",

The challenges relate mostly to the usability of the systems, e.g. judgements are impaired when moderators must manage different pages in documents [10] . Searching through different portfolios presents difficulties when viewing and comparing different candidates' work. Studies indicate that an annotation tool is invaluable in developing shared perspectives of standards in digital moderation [11, 12] . The limited accessibility of such tools increases cognitive demands on the educator and the process can become less reliable [11] . Additionally, teachers involved in eModeration must be confident in the use of the technology [1].",

The most frequent response was that Google Drive or Google docs are used for moderation processes. Respondents agreed that it is easy and effortless to use Google Drive. Feedback is timely and eModeration is especially convenient when the school is in a rural area.

The focus seems to be on convenience and flexibility of use rather than on essential aspects. It seems reasonable therefore to conclude that users focus on aspects that affect them directly as evidenced by the frequency of hardware requirements being mentioned.

The assumption is that participants are skilled as well as experienced (cf. Table 2 ) in the use of technological resources.

Context specific items, for instance a voice over button arising from the focus group interview, were added. The identified dimensions were then analyzed further. Dimensions present in 2 or more streams of evidence (literature review, survey and focus group) were included. These values were categorized under UR, SR or TR; with some overlap.

Empirical data was collected from a focus group interview and an online survey to investigate the current moderation practices of IT and CAT teachers at private secondary schools in SA and triangulate the findings with the challenges, benefits and requirements abstracted from literature. The requirements for an eModeration system (presented under the categories of UR, TR and SR) constitute the theoretical contribution of the study. The pre-adoption attributes could be useful to designers and developers of eModeration systems and hence constitute a practical contribution.",
