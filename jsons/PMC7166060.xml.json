Sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent presents a high reflectivity, allowing the visualization of tissue microcirculation.10 The average in vivo half-life of these microbubbles is 12 minutes (range, 2\u201333 minutes).11 Sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent is not excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, it can be used in patients with renal dysfunction, when contrast agents for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are contraindicated. Sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent does not interact with other organ systems, apart from the lungs and the liver through which the microvesicles are extracted from the body within 10 to 15 minutes by exhaling12 and the phospholipid shell is metabolized by the liver. Furthermore, sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent does not deposit in the human body like the MRI contrast agent Gadolinium, which, after serial application, has been identified in human and animal brain, liver, skin and bone.13 In addition, sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent has a lower side-effect profile than the MRI contrast agent gadolinium.14",

In studies involving the muscular system, the healthy contralateral sides were routinely examined as well to compare tissue perfusion. Patients, who were treated with a reversed shoulder arthroplasty, got an additional power Doppler examination to visualize the perfusion of the deltoid and teres minor muscle. The ultrasound examiner categorized the perfusion qualitatively from 1 (minimal perfusion) to 3 (maximum perfusion). A significantly weaker deltoid perfusion on the operated shoulder could be demonstrated.16",
