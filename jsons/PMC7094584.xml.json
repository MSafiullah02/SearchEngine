Only 1 patient had mildly restrictive pulmonary impairment, and 5 other patients had a decreased diffusing capacity. All our patients who survived ARDS had abnormal diffusing capacity that was reduced compared with that in our SARS patients who did not have ARDS. Orme et al21 found that approximately 80% of their ARDS survivors who did not have SARS had reduced diffusing capacity. Our study found no evidence of pronounced airway obstruction in SARS survivors, an outcome similar to that reported by Aggarwal et al22 and Schelling et al.23 In the latter study, surviving SARS patients not experiencing ARDS had no long-term airflow limitations. In contrast, Orme et al21 reported that 20% of their ARDS survivors who did not have SARS had long-term airflow obstruction. Although the discrepancy of airway obstruction is unclear, it might be due to patient selection bias because some ARDS survivors had a history of chronic airway disease. In our study, 1 SARS-ARDS survivor (25%) had long-term mildly restrictive pulmonary impairment with reduced TLC. The main reason for impaired pulmonary function might be the same as for all ARDS survivors, regardless of whether they experienced SARS. The reduced TLC and reduced FVC were due to lung fibrosis and neuromuscular weakness, respectively.22 Our findings in SARS-ARDS survivors showed only mild reductions in pulmonary function 6 to 8 months after the acute severe illness, consistent with the natural history of ARDS survivors in other studies.21, 22\n",
