Background. Several qPCR kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, mostly lacking of evaluation due to covid19 emergency. Objective. We evaluated nCoV-QS (MiCo BioMed) kit using CDC kit as gold standard. Results. We found limitations for nCoV-QS: 1) lower sensitivity 2) lack of RNA quality control probe. Conclusions. Validation studies should be implemented for any SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR commercial kit to prevent unreliable diagnosis.",
