            "text": "Without entering into a formal analysis of the effects of these outbreaks on productive labor supply, it is evident that, based on the observed 35% clinical attack rates for influenza pandemics, an additional period of absence in a given quarter year by one-third of an economy's labor supply, will have a notable effect on its productive capacity. Simple economic theory teaches us that labor needs to be combined with capital and natural resources in order to produce goods. Although some degree of substitution of labor with capital may mitigate the impact of a reduction in labor supply, such substitution is unlikely to be able to counter the loss of, perhaps, 3\u20135% of an economy's labor supply in a given quarter. Also, although the value of labor lost from the wage that is assigned to that specific quantity of labor can be estimated, this does not necessarily reflect the loss of productive capacity and the knock-on effects as the decline in one sector reduces the supply of intermediate goods to another and hence just-in-time deliveries are no longer able to meet their tight time targets. Although many of these economic effects are difficult to quantify, it should be evident that productive labor supply is just one element of the full economic cost of an outbreak. Clearly, the morbidity and mortality effects of an infectious disease outbreak vary greatly from perhaps 40 million worldwide deaths (aside from morbidity effects) from Spanish flu to 800 worldwide deaths from SARS. However, research suggests that the economic impacts of SARS were much greater than previous pandemics and much of this may be attributable to globalization and indirect health effects. Therefore, there is some evidence to suggest that direct health effects are not necessarily the only or even the main determinants of economic impact, even if they can be correctly estimated.",

            "text": "The loss of productive labor supply through illness and death is not the only factor which could reduce labor inputs to production. During school closure, government policies to mitigate an infectious disease outbreak may also be imposed. In extreme cases, these policies could include advising workers to avoid attending their place of work and, where possible, to work from home. However, a much more likely policy, (and one which the UK implemented in the mild swine flu pandemic in 2009), is a policy of either blanket or reactive school closure. Because children have lower immunity to influenza, mostly attributable to their lack of exposure to previous pandemics, higher clinical attack rates tend to be exhibited in schools than in the population at large. By closing schools, it is intended that the rate of infection amongst children will be reduced and thus will decrease or slow the burden of illness in the population.",

Labor force estimates from the UK suggest that an average of 4.8% of working days will be lost in the quarter of the pandemic due to school closure that lasts 4 weeks, or 15%, if they close for the duration of the outbreak. Some of these estimates may be reduced when informal care arrangements and the ability of some parents to work from home are accounted for. However, the potential for a policy of school closures to result in a greater labor supply loss than the direct health-related effects is evident, and such costs occur in all sectors, not just health. As with the morbidity and mortality effects previously mentioned, these labor force losses will have ripple effects throughout the economy, which need to be captured from the whole-economy perspective.",

Although preferences elicited in this way may not reflect real behavior during an outbreak, conducting the survey shortly after the SARS outbreak may be of assistance in improving the validity of the theoretical responses in estimating true practice. The survey results suggest that 70\u201380% of Europeans would avoid using public transport, avoid entertainment events, and limit their shopping to the essentials. The percentages were similar but slightly smaller for Asian respondents, although Asian respondents were less likely to avoid entertainment events. In response to other questions, approximately one-quarter to one-half of respondents indicated that they would consider taking work absence, remove their children from school, limit social contact, avoid trips to the doctor, and remain indoors.",

The second is the limitation imposed by data availability.

It consists of a system of equations which specify the behavior of economic \u2018agents\u2019 in an economy and calibrates them on the basis of real economic data for a given country or region. For example, the agents include firms (who combine resource inputs to maximize profits), consumers (who consume and save to maximize their welfare), government, and foreign agents. Using this approach, it is possible to compare the economic impact of counterfactual (do nothing) scenarios with scenarios which reflect changes in health and policy. Several studies have designed scenarios which consider the labor supply effects of pandemic illness alone. In particular, the UK studies use two different models: the COMPACT model of the UK and the CGE approach. The models' scenario designs differ slightly, but estimates of the GDP loss from labor supply reductions due to morbidity and mortality vary between approximately 0.2% for mild disease and up to 1% for severe disease. The scenario designs differ in their assumptions concerning school closure duration and the effect of that school closure in mitigating the outbreak, but all studies highlight that the economic impact of school closure alone is likely to impose equivalent or greater additional economic loss than the disease only effects.",

Two examples of this in published studies are work avoidance due to fear of infection relating to the labor supply and changes in consumption. In one article, prophylactic absence from work was modeled as an effect triggered in an individual by the knowledge that someone in their social network has died from the disease. The authors estimated the size of the average social network to be approximately 300 people, and by modeling disease scenarios of differing severity and interventions (vaccination) of differing efficacy, they were able to highlight the potentially much greater economic impact of a fear-induced response to avoid work compared with the disease only effect. The scenarios modeled showed that by avoiding a behavioral response to an outbreak, the potential value of interventions to prevent this harmful economic response might be greater than the value of the health effects alone, and had fear been the driver of behavioral change, the mortality rate of an outbreak might have a more significant effect than the number of people infected.",

Some additional purchases were lost rather than postponed: 50% of car and service use and 30% of recreation and culture purchases. These consumption impacts contributed a first-year GDP loss increase of approximately 2% of GDP, which was 10 times the impact of mild disease alone.

Furthermore, because macroeconomic models are designed for predictive purposes to isolate the economic effect of an event assuming all other things remain the same, it can be difficult to assess prospectively the validity of such models. However, immediately following the SARS outbreak, two macroeconomic modeling studies were published. One used the results of a CGE model designed to predict the impact of the SARS outbreak based on a 6-month duration and capturing the changes to consumer demand and confidence in the future (investment implications). This model predicts a 2.63% GDP loss for Hong Kong and a 1.05% loss for China. The China loss, in particular, would be difficult to distinguish in such a rapidly growing economy, but the predicted GDP loss was approximately US$4.15 billion, which is similar to the approximate US$3.7 billion obtained by retrospective estimation from national statistics. Similarly, the other post-SARS study estimated the impact of SARS to vary, depending on its duration, to be between 0.2% and 0.5% for China, which would, again, be difficult to distinguish and which agrees with the retrospective study's suggestion of \u2018no evidence of a loss.\u2019 The estimate for Hong Kong was between 1.8% and 4% or US$3\u20136.6 billion, which again contains the retrospective estimate. Although this is not proof of the accuracy of macroeconomic models, it provides some evidence of their usefulness in the context of communicable disease modeling.",

Therefore, although the detailed health sector or microeconomic approach remains very important for cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis in general, it is important to remember that the health sector and its patients are inextricably linked to the wider economy and those wider economic effects must, therefore, be captured using appropriate tools such as macroeconomic analysis and modeling.
