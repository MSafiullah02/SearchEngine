Internationally, we have seena move towards blended learning in major tertiary institutions, including those offering nursing education. New Zealand's tertiary education pre-registration Bachelor of Nursing (BN) programmes, for example, have been quick to develop blended learning approaches to meet the technological and practical learning needs of students (Meyer et al., 2014). Some tertiary education institutions in New Zealand are accredited to offer nursing programmes at sites that are separate from the main campus and these exist as \u2018satellite campuses\u2019 (Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2015). Covid-19 and resulting global emergency lockdowns have instigated a sudden need for learning to be blended across professions and institutions internationally. At no time in history has there been such a massive sudden transition towards blended learning. Indeed, the proof manuscript of this article was made available to the authors on day one of New Zealand's national emergency lockdown (26 March 2020).",

It is precisely when the student \u2018does\u2019 \u2013 when for example, they are asked to synthesis, evaluate and create \u2013 that opportunities for higher order thinking arise and deep learning and retention is most likely to occur (Biggs and Tang, 2007). Active learning techniques include engaging with learning materials in authentic and simulated environments, group and project work, case-based and problem-based learning, and collaboration with other students (Zepke et al., 2010). Active learning encourages participation, interaction and student engagement but also requires effective teaching practice (Vaughan et al., 2013).",

When self-regulation was not well-managed or controlled, blended learning negatively impacted everyday life (Smyth et al., 2012). Given the rigor of academic requirements and high occurrences of issues such as anxiety, dissatisfaction, stress, resistance to innovation, isolation, and attitudes related to transitional changes - support was reported as an indicator of student achievement (Bruce et al., 2010; Dacanay et al., 2015; Dorrian and Wache, 2009; Poon, 2013). External mechanism of support and other forms of socialisation influenced student focus and completion. Family support, for instance, was reported as having an effect on reducing learner stress, as did the role of supportive peers and colleagues (Lyons and Evans, 2013; Munich, 2014; Zepke et al., 2010). Learners who maintained multiple roles in addition to their studies (such as breadwinner or primary informal caregiver) reported high levels of stress and personal pressure (Dacanay et al., 2015). This stress increased learner pressure to achieve particularly when participating in clinical learning experiences and preparing for a professional nursing role (Mampunge and Seekoe, 2014; Watt and Pascoe, 2013).",

From the student perspective, communication was least effective when communication between teaching staff and students was restricted to an online setting (Poon, 2013). Literature reported a need for open and prompt communication to reduce anxiety and minimise resistance to online learning, and the importance of communication when implementing innovative teaching strategies (Dorrian and Wache, 2009). Furthermore, if a student perceived a lack of direct contact and communication with staff, it affected their interaction, orientation and focus to studies, which, in turn, impacted negatively on assessment and feedback (Owens et al., 2009). On the whole, literature positively reported on communication strategies that promoted support mechanisms for learning, such as online discussion boards, forums and interactive videos and responses to course evaluation (Dorrian and Wache, 2009; Lyons and Evans, 2013; Meyer et al., 2014; O'Flaherty and Timms, 2015).",
