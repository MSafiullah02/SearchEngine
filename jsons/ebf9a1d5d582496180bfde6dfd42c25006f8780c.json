            "text": "Microbes have contributed significantly to improving the health and well-being of humans. The natural products that they have yielded have not only helped eradicate disease and alleviate suffering, but also greatly increased the average life expectancy. The first major contribution of microbes began back in 1928, when Alexander Fleming discovered in a Petri dish seeded with Staphylococcus aureus that a compound produced by a mold killed the bacterium. The mold, Penicillium notatum, produced an active agent that was named penicillin. Fleming's discovery began the microbial drug era. By using the same method, other naturally occurring substances, like chloramphenicol and streptomycin, were later isolated from bacterial fermentations. Naturally occurring antibiotics are produced by fermentation, an old technique that can be traced back almost 8000 years, initially for beer and wine production, and recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. During the past 4000 years, Penicillium roqueforti has been utilized for cheese production, and for the past 3000 years, soy sauce in Asia and bread in Egypt represented examples of traditional fermentations. 1 Natural products from microbes have a broad range of therapeutic applications and are often produced via primary or secondary metabolism. Because of technical improvements in screening programs and separation and isolation techniques, the number of natural compounds discovered exceeds one million. 2 Among them, 50-60% are produced by plants (alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, carbohydrates, etc.) and 5% of these plant products have a microbial origin. From all the reported natural products, \u223c 20-25% show biological activity and, of these, \u223c 10% have been obtained from microbes. Microorganisms produce many compounds with biological activity. From the 22 500 biologically active compounds so far obtained from microbes, \u223c 40% are produced by fungi. 2, 3 The role of fungi in the production of antibiotics and other drugs for treatment of noninfective diseases has been dramatic. 4 Biosynthetic genes are present in clusters coding for large, multidomain and multimodular enzymes. Some examples of these enzymes include polyketide synthases, prenyltransferases, nonribosomal peptide synthases and terpene cyclases. Genes adjacent to the biosynthetic gene clusters encode regulatory proteins, oxidases, hydroxylases and transporters. Aspergilli usually contain 30-40 secondary metabolite gene clusters. Strategies to activate silent genes have been reviewed by Brakhage and Schroekh. 3 Given that the vast majority of microbes in nature have yet to be cultured (~99%), there have been major advances in isolating and growing different microbial species. 5 Furthermore, metagenomicsthat is, the extraction of DNA from soil, plants and marine habitats and its incorporation into known organisms-is allowing access to a vast untapped reservoir of genetic and metabolic diversity. 6, 7 The potential for discovery of new secondary metabolites with beneficial use for humans is great. A method to predict secondary metabolite gene clusters in filamentous fungi has recently been devised. 8 Interestingly, microbial production of secondary metabolites is limited to a very low level by certain regulatory mechanisms. Despite this, the extent of such production is sufficient for the microbe to compete with other organisms or maintain a commensal/mutual relationship with other species. The industrial microbiologist, however, desires a strain that will overproduce the molecule of interest. Development of higher-producing strains involves mutagenesis and, more recently, recombinant DNA technologies. 9 Although some metabolites of interest can be made by plants or animals, or by chemical synthesis, the recombinant microbe is usually the 'creature of choice'. Thousand-fold increases in production of small molecules have been obtained by mutagenesis and/or genetic engineering. The use of genome mining to discover new fungal natural products has been reviewed by Wiemann and Keller. 10 Other important parts of industrial production include creating a proper nutritional environment for the organism to grow and produce its product, and the avoidance of negative effects such as inhibition and/or repression by carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sources, metals and the final product itself. Avoidance of enzyme decay is also desired. 4, 11 BROAD USE OF SECONDARY METABOLITES PRODUCED BY FUNGI Given the diverse array of secondary metabolites that fungi are capable of producing, the pharmaceutical industry began to focus their efforts on the screening of compounds for indications other than antiinfectives. 12, 13 As microorganisms are such a prolific source of structurally diverse bioactive metabolites, the industry extended their screening programs in order to look for microbes with activity in other disease areas. As a result of this move, some of the most important products of the pharmaceutical industry were obtained. For example, the immunosuppressants have revolutionized medicine by facilitating organ transplantation. 14 Other products include antitumor drugs, hypocholesterolemic drugs, enzyme inhibitors, gastrointestinal motor stimulator agents, ruminant growth stimulants, insecticides, herbicides and antiparasitics versus coccidia and helminths.",

            "text": "Secondary metabolites produced by fungi have yielded compounds that function as immunosuppressants. Cyclosporin A was originally discovered in the 1970s as a narrow-spectrum antifungal peptide produced by the mold, Tolypocladium nivenum (previously Tolypocladium inflatum) in an aerobic fermentation. 15 Cyclosporins are a family of neutral, highly lipophilic, cyclic undecapeptides containing some unusual amino acids, synthesized by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. Discovery of the immunosuppressive activity of this secondary metabolite led to its use in heart, liver and kidney transplants and to the overwhelming success of the organ transplant field. 16 Cyclosporin was approved for use in 1983. It is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. This complex of cyclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin that under normal circumstances is responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin-2. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and therefore leads to a reduced function of effector T cells. Annual world sales of cyclosporin A are \u223c $2 billion. Cyclosporin A also has activity against coronaviruses. 17 Studies on the mode of action of cyclosporin, and the later developed immunosuppressants from actinomycetes, such as sirolimus (a rapamycin) and FK-506 (tacrolimus), have markedly expanded current knowledge of T-cell activation and proliferation. These agents act by interacting with an intracellular protein (an immunophilin), thus forming a novel complex that selectively disrupts the signal transduction events of lymphocyte activation. Their targets are inhibitors of signal transduction cascades in microbes and humans. In humans, the signal transduction pathway is required for activation of T cells. Fingolimod (FTY720), another immunosuppressant, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010, specifically for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The drug, initially discovered by Professors Fujita, Yoshitomi and Taito in collaboration, is a derivative of myriocin isolated from the fungus Isaria sinclairii. The annual world sales of fingolimod are \u223c $2.7 billion.",

            "text": "One of the first antibiotics to be discovered, with a broad spectrum of activity, was mycophenolic acid. Bartolomeo Gosio (1863-1944), an Italian physician, discovered the compound in 1893. 18 Gosio isolated a fungus from spoiled corn that he named Penicillium glaucum, and that was later reclassified as Penicillium brevicompactum. He isolated crystals of the compound from culture filtrates in 1896 and found it to inhibit growth of Bacillus anthracis. This was the first time an antibiotic had been crystallized and the first time that a pure compound had ever been shown to have antibiotic activity. The work was forgotten but fortunately the compound was rediscovered by Alsberg and Black 19 and given the name mycophenolic acid. They used a strain originally isolated from spoiled corn in Italy called Penicillium stoloniferum, a synonym of P. brevicompactum. The chemical structure was elucidated many years later (1952) by Birkinshaw et al. 20 in England. Mycophenolic acid has antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, antipsoriasis and immunosuppressive activities. Its antiviral activity is exerted against yellow fever, dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. 21 It was never commercialized as an antibiotic because of its toxicity, but its 2-morpholinoethylester was approved as a new immunosuppressant for kidney transplantation in 1995 and for heart transplants in 1998. 22 The ester is called mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to mycophenolic acid in the body. It is sometimes used along with cyclosporin in kidney, liver and heart transplants. Furthermore, the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet was approved in 2004 by the FDA as an antimetabolite immunosuppressant indicated for prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant. This delayed-release tablet is called Myfortic and is produced by Novartis, with annual sales of $637 million in 2013, $543 million in 2014 and $441 million in 2015. In addition, mycophenolic acid appears to have anti-angiogenic activity. 23 Agents that block enzyme activity Drugs that are enzyme inhibitors may provide key functions not only for treating human disease, but also in agriculture, enzyme structure elucidation and reaction mechanisms. Several enzyme inhibitors with various industrial uses have been isolated from microbes. 24 Among the most important are the statins and hypocholesterolemic drugs discussed below. Fungal products are also used as enzyme inhibitors against cancer, diabetes, poisoning and Alzheimer's disease. The enzymes inhibited include acetylcholinesterase, protein kinase, tyrosine kinase, glycosidases and others. 25 Cholesterol-lowering agents In humans, it is estimated that \u223c 30% of cholesterol originates from the diet, whereas the remaining 70% is synthesized primarily in the liver. Many people cannot control their level of cholesterol at a healthy level by diet alone and require hypocholesterolemic agents. High blood cholesterol leads to atherosclerosis, a chronic, progressive disease characterized by continuous accumulation of atheromatous plaque within the arterial wall, causing stenosis and ischemia. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of human death. The past two decades have witnessed the introduction of a variety of anti-atherosclerotic therapies. The statins form a class of hypolipidemic drugs, formed as secondary metabolites by fungi, and are used to lower cholesterol by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis; that is, 3-hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase. Inhibition of this enzyme in the liver stimulates low-density lipoprotein receptors, resulting in an increased clearance of lowdensity lipoprotein from the bloodstream and a decrease in blood cholesterol levels. They can reduce total plasma cholesterol by 20-40%. Through their cholesterol-lowering effect, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, prevent stroke and reduce the development of peripheral vascular disease. 26 Statins, which had reached an annual market of nearly $30 billion before one became a generic drug, are widely used in clinical practice. The history of the statins has been described by Akira Endo, the discoverer of the first statin, compactin (mevastatin; ML-236B). 27 This first member of the group was isolated as an antibiotic product of P. brevicompactum. 28 At about the same time, it was found by Endo et al. 29 as a cholesterolemic product of Penicillium citrinum. Although compactin was not of commercial importance, its derivatives achieved strong medical and commercial success. Lovastatin (monacolin K; mevinolin; Mevacor) was isolated in broths of Monascus rubra and Aspergillus terreus. 30, 31 Lovastatin, developed by Merck and approved by the FDA in 1987, was the first commercially marketed statin. In its chemical structure, lovastatin has a hexahydronaphthalene skeleton substituted with a p-hydroxy-lactone moiety (Figure 1) .",

The neuroprotective effect of statins has been demonstrated in an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease using primary cultures of cortical neurons. 37 The effect did not appear to be because of cholesterol lowering but rather reduction in formation of isoprenyl intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic process. Lovastatin has shown antitumor activity against embryonal carcinoma and neuroblastoma cells. 38 Although simvastatin is usually made from lovastatin chemically in a multistep process, an enzymatic/bioconversion process using recombinant Escherichia coli has been developed. 39 Another statin, pravastatin (Pravacol) ($3.6 billion in sales per year), is made via different biotransformation processes from compactin by Streptomyces carbophilus 40 and Actinomadura sp. 41 Both simvastatin and pravastatin are synthetic variants of the naturally occurring lovastatin and compactin. Pravastatin can be produced from compactin but it involves an expensive dual-step fermentation and biotransformation process. Mclean et al. 42 reprogrammed Penicillium chrysogenum involving discovery and engineering of an enzyme involved in hydroxylation of compactin.

            "text": "As stated previously, taxol has also been found to be a fungal metabolite. 54, 57 Fungi such as Taxomyces andreanae, Pestalotiopsis microspora, Tubercularia sp., Phyllosticta citricarpa, Nodulisporium sylviforme, Colletotrichum gloeosporoides, Colletotrichum annutum, Fusarium maire and Pestalotiopsis versicolor produce it. 54, [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] The endophyte F. maire produces 225 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 . Production by P. citricarpa amounted to 265 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 . 65 Production was reported at 417 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 by submerged fermentation with an engineered strain of the endophytic fungus Ozonium sp. (EFY-21). The transformed strain overproduced the rate-limiting enzyme of taxol biosynthesis, taxadiene synthase. 66 Another endophytic fungus, Phoma betae, isolated from the medicinal tree Ginkgo biloba, produced taxol at 795 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 . 67 Cladosporium cladosporoides, an endophyte of the Taxus media tree, produced 800 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 of taxol. 68 Metarhizium anisopiliae H-27, isolated from the tree Taxus chinensis, yielded 846 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 . 69 Although a review of taxol production by endophytic fungi indicated that strain improvement had resulted in levels of only 0.4-1.0 mg l \u2212 1 , 70 it was reported that another fungus, Alternaria alternate var. monosporus, from the bark of Taxus yunanensis, after ultraviolet and nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis, could produce taxol at 227 mg l \u2212 1 . 71 The endophytic fungus P. versicolor, from the plant Taxus cuspidata, produced 478 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 59 and C. annutum from Capsicum annuum made 687 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 . 60 Camptothecin, a modified monoterpene indole alkaloid produced by certain plants (angiosperms) and by the endophytic fungus, Entrophospora infrequens, is another important antitumor agent. The fungus was isolated from the plant Nathapodytes foetida. 53 In view of the low concentration of camptothecin in tree roots and poor yield from chemical synthesis, the fungal fermentation is very promising for industrial production of camptothecin. It is used for recurrent colon cancer and has unusual activity against lung, ovarian and uterine cancers. 72 Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer fatalities in the United States and the third most common cancer among US citizens. Camptothecin is known commercially as Camptosar and Campto and achieved sales of $1 billion in 2003. 73 Camptothecin's water-soluble derivatives irinotecan and topotecan have been approved and are used clinically. Metastatic colorectal cancer is treated by irinotecan, whereas topotecan has use for ovarian cancer, cervical cancer and small-cell lung cancer. A review of the activities of camptothecin and its many small and macromolecular derivatives has been published by Venditto and Simanek. 74 Chemically produced derivatives of camptothecin used for cancer include 10-hydroxycamptothecin, topotecan, irinotecan and SN-38. Camptothecin is a multibillion dollar anticancer drug and the fourth largest anticancer drug derived from plants after taxol, vincristine and vinblastine. Camptothecin is produced by the plants Camptotheca acuminata and Nothapodyta foetida. An endophytic fungus producing camptothecin is E. infrequens from the bark of N. foetida. Recently, it was found that Trichoderma atroviridi strain LY357, an endophytic fungus from C. acuminata, was an improved producer of camptothecin. The endophytic fungus produced 142 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 of camptothecin in the presence of the elicitor methyljasmonate and XAD adsorbant resin. 75 Type 1 DNA topoisomerase has been identified as the cellular target of camptothecin. When patients become resistant to irinotecan, its use can be prolonged by combining it with the monoclonal antibody Erbitux (Cetuximab). Erbitux blocks a protein that stimulates tumor growth and the combination helps metastatic colorectal cancer patients expressing epidermal growth factor receptor. This protein is expressed in 80% of advanced metastatic colorectal cancers. The drug combination reduces invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new areas.",

            "text": "Monascus purpurea, a mold species, has played an important role in traditional Chinese food and medicine since 800 AD. Specifically, it has been used to prepare popular dishes such as koji or Angkak (red rice). 81 Monascorubramine and rubropunctatin are water-soluble red pigments formed upon reaction of the orange pigments monascorubrin and rubropunctatin with amino acids in fermentation media. 82 The fungus is used to prepare red rice, wine, soy-bean cheese, meat and fish. It is authorized in Japan and China for food use. There are 54 known Monascus pigments. They have an amazing number of activities: antimicrobial, anticancer, antimutagenesis, antidiabetic, antiobesity, anti-inflammatory, cholesterol lowering, immunosuppressive and hypotensive. 83, 84 Nutritional control of the formation of the red pigments has been described in a series of publications by Lin and Demain. [85] [86] [87] [88] C50 carotenoids, such as sarcinaxanthin and its glucosides, are more powerful quenchers of singlet oxygen than \u03b2-carotene. They have potential for use in nutriceuticals, pharmaceuticals and derived products such as apocarotenoids or norisoprenoids. Vitamin A is a norisoprenoid and a cleavage product of \u03b2-carotene (\u03b2-carotene is also known as provitamin A). Other norisoprenoids include safranal (providing saffron flavor to sauces and paella dishes), bixin (a pigment in annatto used to color cheeses), damascenone (a part of many perfumes) and ionones (for flavoring of soft drinks, candies and tobacco). Other norisoprenoids include the plant hormone abscisic acid and strigolactones, having functions in plants. C40 carotenoids, that is, terpenoids, can be produced by metabolically engineered S. cerevisiae, as is \u03b2-carotene. The engineering involves introduction of three genes from the astaxanthin producer X. dendrorhous.",

This oxygenated carotenoid pigment is used in the feed, food and cosmetic industries. It is responsible for the orange to pink color of salmonid flesh and the reddish color of boiled crustacean shells. Feeding of pen-reared salmonids with a diet containing this yeast induces pigmentation of the white muscle. 91 It is a very good antioxidant, 10 times more active than \u03b2-carotene and 100 times more than \u03b1-tocopherol. It is the second most important carotenoid. Astaxanthin enhances the immune system and protects skin from radiation injury and cancer. It can be produced synthetically as hydroxyl-astaxanthin from petrochemicals with a selling price of $2500 kg \u2212 1 . However, the natural product is favored because the synthetic product is a mixture of stereoisomers. Natural astaxanthin is more stable than the synthetic version and more bioavailable; that is, it has a higher degree of absorption into a living system. The natural product is present in algae and fish as mono-and di-esters of fatty acids. However, it is difficult to hydrolyze the esters from algae, limiting its usage to trout and salmon. The yeast product is better as it is the 97% free, nonesterified (3R, 3'R) stereoisomer. The astaxanthin market was $219 million in 2007, with 97% being synthetic. Most of the production processes with the yeast yield levels of astaxanthin o100 mg l \u2212 1 . However, white light improved production to 420 mg l \u2212 1 , 92 and mutant strain UBv-AX2 can make 580 mg l \u2212 1 . 93 ",

A new and approved cephalosporin is ceftobiprole that is active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and is not hydrolyzed by a number of \u03b2-lactamases from Gram-positive bacteria. 100 Another antibiotic of note is cerulenin, an antifungal agent produced by Acremonium caerelens. It was the first inhibitor of fatty acid biosynthesis discovered. 101 It alkylates and inactivates the active-site nucleophylic cysteine of the ketosynthase enzyme of fatty acid synthetase by epoxide ring opening. Other properties that are desired in new antibiotics are improved pharmacological properties, ability to combat viruses and parasites and improved potency and safety. A new antifungal natural product is parnafungin, produced by Fusarium lavarum, that inhibits poly(A) polymerase in Candida albicans as well as a broad range of pathogenic fungi. 102 A major antibiotic problem has been the development of resistance to carbapenem antibiotics, such as imipenem and meropenem, by Gram-negative pathogens. This is mainly because of the occurrence of extended spectrum metallo-\u03b2-lactamases such as NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase). King et al. 103 isolated a natural product called aspergillomarasmine (AMA) from the soil fungus Aspergillus versicolor that inhibits NDM-1 and another metallo-\u03b2-lactamases called VIM-2. AMA is a peptide inhibitor of metalloproteinases. AMA fully restored the activity of meropenem against bacteria carrying NDM or VIM metallo-\u03b2-lactamases. The work was done by Gerard Wright and his group at McMaster University. 103-105 NDM-1 requires zinc and AMA removes zinc from the enzyme. The combination of AMA and the carbapenem has shown its effect in mice and in human cell culture.",

Quinine from the bark of the Chinchona tree and artemisinin from the Chinese herb (Artemisia annua) have been the two major drugs used against malaria. Quinine has been used for 41000 years but artemisinin is a newer drug. Quinine has some side effects, such as arrhythmia, thrombocythemia and cinchonism, and this is the main reason for the extensive use of artemisinin. Artemisinin is an endoperoxide sesquiterpine lactone, the most potent and effective antimalarial and is useful against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives is increasing but is still mild. The level of artemisinin in A. annua is very low (0.01-1% of the weight of the dried leaves). Thus, genetic engineering has been pursued. A genetically engineered S. cerevisiae strain producing 100 mg l \u2212 1 of artemisinic acid has been developed by the Keasling group in Berkeley, California. Artemisinic acid can be chemically converted to artemisinin. Keasling's company, Amyris Biotechnologies, has increased the amount of artemisinic acid produced by one million fold. The artemisinin precursor amorpha-4, 11-diene is made by the engineered S. cerevisae at 40 g l \u2212 1 . 108 Organic acids Carboxylic acids are made mainly by catalysis from petroleum-based precursors but interest in microbial production is increasing. 109 Annual production of these compounds is as follows (ktons): acetic acid: 10 000; acrylic acid: 4200; 3-hydroxypropionic acid: 3600; adipic acid: 3000; citric acid: 1600; lactic acid: 450; fumaric acid: 200; gluconic acid: 87; itaconic acid: 80; malic acid: 60; glucaric acid: 42; glycolic acid: 40; and succinic acid: 37. Acetic and lactic acids are used as food preservatives. Lactic acid is also used to produce the biodegradable polymer polylactide. Citric and malic acids are food additives. Gluconic acid is used to chelate divalent and trivalent metal ions. Acrylic and adipic acids are employed to make polymers. Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a tanning and dyeing agent. The main acids showing promise for microbial production are succinic, lactic and itaconic acids. S. cerevisiae could become a leading organism for carboxylic acid production, mainly because it can grow at low pH. It was the first eukaryote to have its entire genome sequenced. Considerable genetic engineering has been done with this yeast. Also important is its naturally occurring, episomally replicating plasmid, named the 2-\u03bc plasmid. The organism can make lactic acid at 62 g l \u2212 1 and malic acid at 50 g l \u2212 1 .",

Itaconic acid is made by A. terreus at 80 000 tons per year with a selling price of $2 kg \u2212 1 in a fermentation process that is more economical than chemical synthesis. A deficiency of manganese is a critical parameter for its production. 110 Production can be completely inhibited by manganese ions. However, if the Mn concentration is kept below 5 \u03bcg l \u2212 1 , with an initial sugar concentration of 100 g l \u2212 1 or higher, the itaconic acid production by A. terreus is similar to that of citric acid production by A. niger under the same conditions (see below). A titer of 130 g l \u2212 1 of itaconic acid was produced. 110 Increasing pH during the production phase increased production by A. terreus to 146 g l \u2212 1 . 111 The modification was done by raising the pH from 4 to 6 or by raising pH to 3 after 2.1 days of cultivation.",

It is noncarcinogenic and noncaloric as it is not digested by humans, and cannot be fermented by bacteria to cause dental caries. Repeated batch cultures of Y. lipolytica on crude glycerol yielded 220 g l \u2212 1 with a yield of 0.43 g g \u2212 1 of glycerol used and a productivity of 0.54 g l \u2212 1 h \u2212 1 . 145 Xylitol, a pentahydroxy sugar alcohol originating from xylose, has applications in foods and pharmaceuticals. A review of xylitol production from lignocellulosic waste has been written by Lima de Albuquerque et al. 146 Xylitol is a low-calorie sweetener used by diabetics with 40% fewer calories than sucrose. It is noncariogenic and has insulin-independent metabolism properties. Xylitol has high solubility, low glycemic rate, lack of carcinogenicity and has cariostatic properties. It is used in food production. It is made by catalytic hydrogenation of xylose but this is very expensive. Its global market is over 125 000 tons per year and it sells for $4.50-5.50 per kg to pharmaceutical and food companies. It has a 12% share of the total polyol market for chewing gum and foods. It is used as a sucrose replacement for cakes, cookies, chocolate and chewing gum, and in pharmaceuticals to reduce tooth decay. It acts against oral biofilms especially against Streptococcus mutans. It is also active against other bacteria harmful to oral health, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has also been cited as a contributor to tooth calcification, and is active against diabetes, anemia, acute otitis media and osteoporosis. Of great interest is its production from xylose in lignocellulosic materials as 100% of the xylose can be converted to xylitol microbially. This is favored over chemical synthesis that uses more intense reaction conditions and yields undesirable coproducts that have to be removed. Fermentation of xylose to xylitol occurs under milder conditions of temperature and pressure, yielding lower levels of unwanted by-products. Cell-free systems have been used, but immobilized systems hold great promise because of higher levels of xylitol produced, as well as the possibility of reuse of successive cultures as a fed-batch process or prolonged fermentations during continuous processes. Systems used include stirred tank reactors, packed-bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors, bubble columns and air-lift reactors. Processes include batch culture, fed-batch or semi-continuous culture and continuous culture. Bioconversion of 300 g l \u2212 1 xylose to xylitol by Debaryomyces hansenii amounted to 110 g l \u2212 1 . 147 The yield was 0.48 g g \u2212 1 . Repeated fed-batch fermentation (lasting 750 h) with high-cell density cultures of Candida magnolia TISTR 5663 in a 2-l stirred tank fermenter under oxygen limitation with feeding of xylose and nitrogen and a starting xylose concentration of 60 g l \u2212 1 led to production of 284 g l \u2212 1 of xylitol, 148 the highest titer ever achieved. Xylitol productivity was 1.49 g l \u2212 1 h \u2212 1 . Candida tropicalis has also been used by other groups. The overall conclusion is that immobilization of yeast cells is an excellent way to produce xylitol from xylose. Immobilization was best when entrapment in calcium alginate, followed by solid adsorption, was used.",

Today, crude oil is consumed at 11.6 million tons per day that cannot last for a long time. Biodiesel use requires no engine modification. It is blended with diesel in Germany, Italy and Malaysia. It is better than diesel as it is biodegradable, nontoxic and releases less toxicant when burned as a fuel. Chemical catalysis is presently used to make biodiesel but enzymatic catalysis is looked upon as better from the aspects of mild reaction conditions and easy product separation. Current biodiesel production suffers from the lack of a stable, sufficient feedstock supply system, inconsistent performance and challenging economics. Microbial production could overcome these problems because of short producing period, little labor requirement, easy scale-up and independence from problems of venue, season, climate change, etc. So-called 'grease microorganisms' (oleaginous microbes that supply fatty acids and alcohols and convert them to biodiesel) could supply the fatty acids needed. Their composition of the fatty acids is similar to vegetable oils that are used to make biodiesel. They have 450% lipid content, can be used industrially, grow rapidly, are not polluting and oil can be easily extracted. Microalgae have been considered as an oil feedstock but their use is restricted by their low growth rate, strict breeding conditions and large up-front investment requirement. Alcohol is needed in the transesterification process to generate the fatty acid ester. Methanol or ethanol can be used to generate the fatty acid ester. Methanol makes fatty acid methyl esters, whereas ethanol yields fatty acid ethyl esters. Fatty acid methyl esters are cheaper, more reactive and volatile. However, ethanol is less toxic, and more renewable than methanol. S. cerevisiae has been genetically engineered for de novo biosynthesis of biodiesel. Of potential importance is Y. lipolytica for microbial biodiesel production.",

It is a semisynthetic derivative of pneumocandin B0, a lipophilic cyclic peptide isolated from the fungus, Glarea lozoyensis. 171 The sales of this antifungal, which was sold under the name Cancidas by Merck, was $681 million in 2014 and $573 million in 2015. The second antifungal from the echinocandin class that was licensed was micafungin, sold under the trade name Fungard/Mycamine by Astellas Pharma. It achieved annual sales of 38.8 billion yen or about $352 million in 2014, and in 2015 the sales reached 41.6 billion yen or $346 million. Patients who have received either of these antifungal agents have reported mild adverse events that include local phlebitis, fever, abnormal liver function tests and hemolysis. 170 Echinocandins are usually given once daily, via the parenteral route, because of poor absorption after oral administration. Caspofungin has shown promising results in studies of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, with nearly the same efficacy as amphotericin B, but markedly less toxicity.

The compounds they have produced have helped save millions of lives, alleviated pain and suffering and increased human life expectancy. In addition, they have also played a vital role in the animal industry and agricultural operations. However, for a variety of reasons, pathogenic microbes have become resistant to many antibiotics, creating a dangerous situation. Therefore, the need for new and effective antibiotics is imperative. Unfortunately, most of the large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antimicrobial compounds. Because of economics, they have concluded that drugs directed against chronic diseases offer a better revenue stream than do antimicrobial agents, for which the length of treatment is short and government restriction is likely. Some small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are still developing antibiotics, but most depend on venture capital rather than sales income and, with the present regulations, face huge barriers to enter into the market. These barriers were raised with the best intentions of ensuring public safety but they are having the opposite effect; that is, termination of antibiotic development while resistance continues to increase. 172 However, there are some new bright possibilities. One of the more promising is the utilization of uncultivated microorganisms. Considering that 99% of bacteria and 95% of fungi have not yet been cultivated in the laboratory, efforts to find means to grow such uncultured microorganisms is proceeding and succeeding. 5 Furthermore, researchers are now extracting bacterial DNA from soil samples, cloning large fragments into, for example, bacterial artificial chromosomes, expressing them in a host bacterium and screening the library for new antibiotics. This metagenomic effort could open up the exciting possibility of a large untapped pool from which new natural products could be discovered. 173 Another exciting possibility is that of genome mining. 174 In addition to these relatively new techniques, chemical and biological modification of old antibiotics could still supply new and powerful drugs. These comments also apply to nonantibiotics such as antitumor agents and other microbial products. In addition, natural products must continue to be tested for desirable therapeutic activities. We believe that significant progress in identifying new antibiotics, oncology therapeutics and other useful medicines will be made, probably not by the big pharmaceutical companies, but by biotechnology companies and small research groups from institutes and universities.",
