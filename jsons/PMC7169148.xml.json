Seasonal flu outbreaks are commonplace; in particular, the 1918 pandemic killed millions of people 1. In 2009, a new influenza pandemic caused by a novel S\u2010OIV H1N1 has resulted in millions of infections in more than 214 countries 2, 3. H5N1 virus was also classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus because it can cause severe illness and high mortality. Recent studies have identified just five mutations (known as N1581D/N2241K/Q2261L/T3181I) in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that allow H5N1 virus to spread through the air between ferrets 4, 5, 6. Furthermore, new strains of influenza viruses were recently detected, including H7N9, H5N8, and H5N5 7, 8, 9.",

            "text": "Genetic variation of influenza A virus is a key problem that results from genetic drift and genetic shift, making it almost impossible to produce a timely and sufficiently effective vaccine to prevent epidemic outbreaks. For this reason, antiviral drugs have offered an important option to combat avian flu, including H7N9 and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 10, 11, 12. Currently, two classes of anti\u2010influenza drugs are available. These target the M2 ion channel and neuraminidase (NA) expressed on the virus envelope, respectively. Since 2003, M2 ion channel inhibitors have had extremely limited clinical application as a result of neurological side effects and widespread drug resistance 13, 14. NA inhibitors (NAIs) are currently the most effective therapy against all strains of influenza A and B viruses 12. Oseltamivir and zanamivir were licensed and recommended for treatment and prevention of acute uncomplicated flu caused by influenza 12, 15, 16, 17, 18. Two other NAIs, peramivir and laninamivir, have been approved for seasonal use in Japan and are under clinical evaluations in other countries 19, 20. Peramivir is also approved for use in Korea and China, as well as the USA. According to surveillance data between 2013 and 2014, 98.2 and 100% of 2009 H1N1 viruses tested for surveillance were susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir, respectively (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/antiviral-drug-resistance.htm). These drugs have offered new prospects for influenza management. However, virus strains resistant to NAIs are constantly emerging. In addition, dual resistance to both oseltamivir and amantadine has been detected 21, 22, 23. Thus, it is urgent and important to investigate new antiviral drugs against influenza virus.",

Second, receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis occurs, and the virus enters the host cell in an endosome. The endosome has a low pH of around 5 to 6, which triggers the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Following release into the cytoplasm, the vRNPs enter the nuclei of infected cells. Third, when completing the transcription and replication of the viral genome, vRNPs are exported from the nucleus, followed by assembly and budding at the host cell membrane. Fourth, viral particles are released from the cell 24, 25, 26. One of the most important steps that must occur before the newly made viral particle can leave the plasma membrane is the cleavage of sialic acid residue from glycoproteins and glycolipids. Without this process, the viral particle could not be released from the plasma membrane and go on to infect neighboring cells. Recently, the receptor\u2010binding function of NA has been reported 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.",

            "text": "Recently, it has been proposed that NA may facilitate virus entry into target cells in the initial stage of viral infection, and some attempts have been made to analyze this new role. It is well known that NA promotes virus access to target cells in airways by mucous degradation. Consistent with this hypothesis, some studies showed that NA facilitates the spread of virus through mucous that covers the human airway epithelium. The most likely mechanism is related to removal of decoy receptors on mucins, cilia, and cellular glycocalyx 36, 37. However, lung cancer A549 and MDCK cells, which are widely used as influenza models, do not secrete mucin. It is therefore possible that NA has adopted a novel way to aid in virus entry, and recent studies have demonstrated that NA does, indeed, play a direct and early role in influenza A virus entry. Ohuchi et al., for example, found that NA facilitates virus transfer from an endocytosis\u2010inactive site to an endocytosis\u2010active site, thus facilitating virus entry into target cells, noting that such activity can be blocked by NAIs 38. Other authors have suggested that NA expression can directly impact HA\u2010dependent influenza virus fusion and virus infection efficiency based on the enzymatic activity of NA 39. With the unchanged HA, NA replacement in the background of PR8 virus had significant effect on the efficiency of infection initiation, virus release and fusion of infected cells 40. Such results call for more research to confirm the role of NA in facilitating influenza virus entry to susceptible cells.",

            "text": "Surprisingly, several research groups have reported that NA has acquired the capacity to bind receptors. These reports have challenged the generally accepted concept of NA as an effector during viral fusion and release (Figure 2). Under this new concept, NA can bind receptors on the host cell surface and complement the process of HA receptor binding. A recent report revealed a D151G NA mutant that promoted NA\u2010dependent and NAI\u2010sensitive hemagglutination and caused the attachment of recently isolated human H3N2 viruses via their NA to sialic acid receptors refractory to catalytic cleavage. Although HA is still required for viral entry, the specificity of NA appears to complement a deficiency in HA binding. Thus, NA displays two biological activities, including the complementary binding specificities of HA and the cleavage of sialic acid at the early and late stages, respectively, of viral life cycle. It was subsequently shown that D151G NA mutant has sialic acid binding activity for avian \u03b12\u20103 and human \u03b12\u20106 sialic acid glycans in their active sites and that oseltamivir blocked the binding to \u03b12\u20103\u2010linked sialic acids of human H3N2 isolates with D151G 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, again highlighting that D151G NA mutant plays a role in viral entry.",

Specifically, G147R NA allows NA to mediate viral infection and RBC agglutination in a manner that can be reversibly blocked by NAIs and anti\u2010NA antibodies 33. Subsequent studies have shown that the NAs of some human influenza A (H3N2) viruses isolated as early as 1994 had gained such receptor\u2010binding function 34. However, some researchers still challenge the theory that NA can facilitate virus entry at all 41.

These residues are highly conserved in all NA subtypes 55, 56, 57, 58. Based on the conserved catalytic site, intensive research has focused on structural modification of existing NAIs, as well as the design of novel NAIs, some of which have been previously reviewed 59, 60, 61, 62.

The principal role of D151 is believed to stabilize the transition state intermediate in the cleavage reaction 65, 66, 67. The key hydrogen bond between glycosidic oxygen of sialic acid and the residue D151 is a critical interaction for the enzymatic activity of NA (Figure 4A). The residue D151 in wild type of NA may function as a \u201cscissor\u201d to cleave the sialic acid receptor. Therefore, it is understandable that wild\u2010type NA exhibits no detectable binding to sialosides. However, once the aspartic acid 151 of NA is replaced by glycine, NA is able to bind to the receptor, resulting in the attachment of virus via its NA to sialic acid receptors on red blood cells. The entry of virus carrying NA with D151G mutation could be blocked by NAIs, indicating that G151 locates in the binding site of NA to its receptor 27. As shown in Figure 4B, the pivotal hydrogen bond of residue D151 involving the cleavage activity of NA is eliminated because of the insufficient length of residue G151 side chain. Therefore, unlike the wild\u2010type NA, binding of the NA with D151G mutation to the \u03b12\u20103\u2010linked sialic acid receptor does not effectively cleave the receptor but rather mediates the entry of the virus into the target cell.",
