However, the use of salbutamol nebules generates aerosol, which increases the risk of droplet contamination that can remain in the air and spread virus particles. The use of salbutamol pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) reduces the risk of aerosol-generating particles [1]. Therefore, pMDIs (Fig. 1) are preferred when trying to reduce viral transmission.",

Therefore, with strict quality control measures, one could effectively and safely reuse pMDIs [5]. Dunlew et al. took cultures from salbutamol pMDI nozzles before and after disinfection with an alcohol prep pad, as well as after administration [6]. Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in at least 5% of the cultures with all three types of specimens, including those taken after the nozzle was disinfected with an alcohol prep pad [6]. In an experiment by Hinson and Rau [7], failure to wipe the canister nozzle with an alcohol prep pad before patient use in the hospital was assessed; one of 18 cultures (5.5%) resulted in the growth of Streptococci group D (Enterococci).",
