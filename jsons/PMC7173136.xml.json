The genome consists of 8 open reading frames (ORFs) that are expressed through the production of a nested set of 7 subgenomic 3\u2032 co-terminal mRNAs. ORF 1 encodes for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORFs 2\u20137 are postulated to encode for structural proteins, but only 3 proteins have been consistently identified in virions and/or lysates of virus-infected cells. These are the 15 kD nucleocapsid (N), 19 kD matrix (M), and 25 kD envelope (E or GP5) proteins that are encoded by ORFs 7, 6, and 5, respectively (Bautista et al., 1996, Conzelmann et al., 1993, Meulenberg et al., 1993, Meulenberg et al., 1995, Nelson et al., 1994, Yoon et al., 1995). Proteins encoded by ORFs 2\u20134 are designated GP2, GP3, and GP4, where \u2018GP\u2019 indicates \u2018glycoprotein\u2019 and the number designates the ORF from which it is derived (Meulenberg and Petersen-den Besten, 1996, van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996).

            "text": "The PRRSV possesses four characteristics that may contribute to difficulties in diagnosis and control of the disease, including production of effective vaccines (Yoon, 2003). These are: (1) tropism for macrophage or macrophage-lineage cells; (2) remarkable antigenic variation among PRRSV field isolates; (3) enhancement of virus infection by the presence of antibody, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE); and (4) ability to establish persistent infection. Tropism for macrophages is a significant impediment for exposed animals to develop effective local and systemic immunity (Van Reeth and Adair, 1997). The antigenic variability has the potential of rendering useless any preexisting antibody that once was capable of neutralizing the virus and permits the development of new strains that can evade the immune system or revert to virulence (Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998). ADE can facilitate the attachment and internalization of the virus into its host cells, such as macrophages and monocytes, through Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis using antibody present at subneutralizing levels (Cancel-Tirado and Yoon, 2003). Persistence has significant epidemiological implications related to virus perpetuation in a herd and transmission to na\u00efve animals (Zimmerman et al., 1992).",

To minimize the risk associated with ADE in controlling disease by vaccination, efforts have been made to formulate vaccines inducing a balanced immune response and to identify viral component(s) associated with ADE or neutralization of virus infection (Mascola et al., 1993, Morens, 1994). In addition, numerous researchers have studied the mechanisms of ADE, particularly cellular events besides simple increased uptake of the virus coupled with antibody (Ochiai et al., 1992, Prohaszka et al., 1997). The following study was conducted to characterize the role of PRRS viral proteins in ADE and virus neutralization and identify responsible epitope(s) recognized by monoclonal antibodies, working toward the development of a subunit vaccine that would offer protection against PRRSV.",

Then, cells were further incubated for 2\u20133 days at 37 \u00b0C in a humid 5% CO2 incubator. At the end of the incubation period, the monolayers were fixed with 80% acetone aqueous solution and stained with the anti-PRRSV mAb cocktail. Virus titers in samples treated with individual mAbs were expressed as FFU/ml as described above and compared to those in the virus control.",

In addition to the non-linear plot of read-out, antigen-specific reactivity could not be demonstrated on the commercial ELISA with some mAbs, particularly those specific for M and GP5 proteins, which may be attributed to the lack of particular mAb epitopes in the ELISA kit or the difference in antigenic format (i.e., linear versus conformational). Thus, mAbs were standardized so that all mAbs would have a titer similar to the mAb with the lowest titer according to IFA test results, i.e., 104 IFA titer.",

            "text": "In general, ADE of infection by enveloped viruses is believed to be mediated by epitope(s) associated with envelope protein or membrane-associated protein(s) (Cancel-Tirado and Yoon, 2003). Our observations with PRRSV mAbs were in agreement with other investigators\u2019 observations. Epitopes associated with ADE are determined to reside on the 15 kD nucleocapsid and 25 kD envelope (GP5) proteins, whereas epitopes of the 19 kD matrix, GP5 and 45 kD GP3 proteins were mainly associated with virus neutralization based on the panel of mAbs used for the study. It is worthwhile to note that mAbs ISU25C and ISU45B suppressed PRRSV replication in both the MARC-145 cell line and PAMs. Involvement of GP5 protein in inducing neutralizing or enhancing antibodies has been demonstrated by our laboratory and others (Gonin et al., 1999, Kwang et al., 1999, Weiland et al., 1999, Yoon, 2003, Yang et al., 2000, Yoon et al., 1996). It was, however, unexpected that an antigenic determinant of the GP3 protein, recognized by mAb ISU45B, would be associated with inhibition of PRRSV replication. Statistically, mAb ISU45B showed much stronger inhibition of PRRSV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages (PRRSV natural target cells) than mAb ISU25C that recognizes an epitope on the GP5 protein (P\n < 0.01). For some North American PRRSV isolates, GP3 protein has been reported as a non-structural protein. In contrast, it has been described as a structural protein for some European PRRSV isolates (Meulenberg and Petersen-den Besten, 1996). A recent study reported that ORF3 product of a Spanish PRRSV strain from recombinant Baculoviruses provided pigs with protective immunity against PRRSV challenge (Plana Duran et al., 1997). Further investigation remains to determine the role of GP3 in PRRSV pathogenesis or immunity.",

            "text": "PRRSV infection was also enhanced or suppressed when treated with mAbs specific to epitopes on the nucleocapsid (N) protein (i.e. ISU15E enhanced, ISU15A and B suppressed). These were unexpected observations since no part of the N protein has been demonstrated to be exposed to the outside of intact virions. Theoretically, such observations are possible if naked or partially stripped viruses containing intact infectious RNA were in the virus preparation used for the assay, which is likely since the virus material used in our study was not purified through zonal centrifugation. However, it also has been demonstrated that the requirement of intact infectious virions for infection in permissive cells can be bypassed through ADE pathway for virus entry (Mason et al., 1994). Consequently, our observation on ISU15E may have a significant implication in the pathogenesis of PRRSV. The 15 kD N protein is known to be highly immunogenic, and abundant expression of ORF 7 (the gene encoding for the N protein) in the early stage of infection has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Bautista et al., 1996, Loemba et al., 1996, Mardassi et al., 1994, Yoon et al., 1996). Likewise, it has also been reported that high levels of non-neutralizing antibody, most of which is specific for the N protein, are produced in pigs following exposure (Nelson et al., 1994, Yoon et al., 1996). Subsequently, PRRSV could take advantage of ADE for entry to target cells (i.e., macrophages or macrophage-lineage cells). Nevertheless, as demonstrated in our results, some of the anti N antibodies may have a suppressive effect, but as stated above this could be related to the presence of naked virus or virions partially stripped from their envelope in the virus suspension used in the assay.",

            "text": "In vitro assessment of ADE activity by antibody can be affected by various factors. These include isotype or subtype of immunoglobulin (Hohdatsu et al., 1994) and assay conditions such as virus strain (e.g., homologous versus heterologous), antibody titer, multiplicity of infection and parameter(s) for measuring enhancement (Morens et al., 1987a, Morens et al., 1987b, Ochiai et al., 1992, Robinson et al., 1989, Szabo et al., 1999). All of these factors were taken into consideration for the study, including isotype determination. All mAbs used were of the IgG1 subtype, thus, any results from ADE or neutralization assays described in the present study are independent of the immunoglobulin isotype/subtype and a property intrinsic to the epitope bound. Although all isotypes of murine IgG were shown to be capable of enhancing virus infection to macrophages of murine origin (Morens et al., 1987a), our observations of ADE of PRRSV infection to PAM by mAbs of the IgG1 subtype are distinct from results of previous studies on ADE of FIPV infection to macrophages of feline origin by mAbs. Corapi et al. evaluated the ability of 19 mAbs specific for the S envelope protein of FIPV to induce ADE of infection in feline peritoneal macrophages (Corapi et al., 1992). All mAbs were capable of neutralizing the ability of the virus to infect a permissive cell line. Fifteen of 19 mAbs induced ADE of infection in macrophages and all but one were of the IgG2a subclass. The remaining four mAbs that did not induce ADE of infection were IgG1. The difference in the isotypes between neutralizing mAbs that induced ADE and those that did not induce ADE suggests that there might be a restriction in the subclasses capable of mediating ADE of virus infection. It is also possible that the difference in the ability of FIPV-specific murine IgG isotypes to mediate ADE of infection is due to differences in the binding affinity of murine isotypes to FcR on feline macrophages (Hohdatsu et al., 1994). It remains to be further studied whether similar isotype restriction exists in murine mAbs for their capability of enhancing or suppressing PRRSV infection to PAM.",

Previous studies have suggested that PRRSV infection can be inhibited or enhanced in the presence of antibody, depending upon the ratio between immunoglobulins and available specific epitopes or between antibody molecules and virion numbers (Hawkes and Lafferty, 1967, Porterfield, 1986, Yoon et al., 1996, Yoon et al., 1997). The same observation was also made in this study with polyclonal anti-PRRSV swine serum and may be attributed to the fact that an antiserum consists of various subpopulations of antibodies, each of which represents different specificity, affinity, and avidity. Since a mAb recognizes a single epitope, such a phenomenon was not expected to occur. As anticipated, the role of individual mAbs in ADE and VN was distinct as shown by the general regression model, except to ISU19C. This mAb suppressed PRRSV replication when the virus was treated with it at higher concentration (P\n \u2264 0.01). As antibody concentration was lowered by serial dilution the suppressive effect of this mAb disappeared and became enhancing; however, such a trend was not considered statistically significant at P\n \u2264 0.01.",

Our present study provides the antigenic basis for developing subunit vaccines that would induce protective immunity with minimal or no risk for ADE. However, molecular characterization of epitopes that were postulated to induce enhancing and neutralizing antibodies in this study remains to be further explored. The biological significance of our findings in pigs also remains to be determined as the work using murine monoclonal antibodies represents only a model for solving the problem of ADE. Practical application of our findings remains to be seen in an animal study.
