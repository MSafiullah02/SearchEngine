Susceptible persons who contacted these contaminated surfaces may transfer the pathogens to their mucous membranes via hands, leading to a risk of respiratory infection. The exposure and infection risk contributed by this transmission route depend on indoor surface material, ventilation, and human behavior. In this study, quantitative infection risk assessments were used to compare the significances of these factors. The risks of three pathogens, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus, in an aircraft cabin and in a hospital ward were assessed. Results showed that reducing the contact rate is relatively more effective than increasing the ventilation rate to lower the infection risk. Nonfabric surface materials were found to be much more favorable in the indirect contact transmission for RSV and rhinovirus than fabric surface materials. In the cases considered in this study, halving the ventilation rate and doubling the hand contact rate to surfaces and the hand contact rate to mucous membranes would increase the risk by 3.7-16.2%, 34.4-94.2%, and 24.1-117.7%, respectively. Contacting contaminated nonfabric surfaces may pose an indirect contact risk up to three orders of magnitude higher than that of contacting contaminated fabric surfaces. These findings provide more consideration for infection control and building environmental design.",

(1) Infectious particles can be deposited on solid surfaces. When people contact these contaminated surfaces and then contact their eyes, mouths, or noses, there could be a potential infection of respiratory diseases. This is referred to as the indirect contact transmission (or fomite transmission). Conjunctiva and nasal mucous membrane can also be a portal of entry for many respiratory pathogens. (2) Table I shows some examples. In buildings, infectious particles can be Although some studies suggested that indirect contact may not be the most dominant mode of transmission for some respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza, this mode still has a significant contribution to the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) In a risk assessment study, Nicas and Jones suggested that virus-contaminated hand contact with facial membranes contributed to 31% of the infection risk. (7) In an experimental infection study, 1 of 8 test animals acquired infection through indirect contact mode. (4) In addition, indirect contact transmission can pose a much longer duration for potential exposure than the other two modes of transmission. (8) This is because infectious particles only have the life times from a few seconds to hours in the indoor air, depending on their sizes, ventilation rate, and the airflow pattern. (9, 10) However, viable pathogens contained in deposited particles can survive on inanimate surfaces from hours to weeks. (8, 11) These surfaces become fomites, which can pose potential risk to susceptible persons for a long period of time, even after the sources of the infectious particles are removed. (8) Factors affecting the risk of indirect contact transmission of a respiratory disease include (i) infectious source strength-the quantity of infectious agents introduced into the air during the exposure time interval: this influences the risk of other modes of transmission as well; (ii) human behavior-how often would the susceptible person contact the contaminated surfaces and his/her mucous membrane; (iii) ventilation-this affects the dispersion of the infectious particles in the space and the subsequent deposition of infectious particles on various surfaces; and (iv) surface material-this affects the amount of infectious particles that can be deposited on the material surface, the survivability of the pathogenic mi-croorganisms on the surface, and the transfer rate of pathogenic microorganisms from the contaminated surface to the hand after a contact.",

            "text": "Although understanding has been established on the indirect contact transmission process of respiratory infection, little research has been done to evaluate the relative significance of these factors. Quantitative infection risk assessment provides a scientific way for such evaluation. The classical Wells-Riley equation used for infection risk assessment of respiratory disease only considers airborne transmission mode; dose-response model, on the other hand, is a more general exposure and risk assessment approach that can assess infection risk from multiple transmission modes. (12) To assess the risk of indirect contact transmission of respiratory diseases, the processes starting from the deposition of aerosolized pathogens onto surfaces and the transfer of pathogens from contaminated surfaces to hands and from hands to mucous membranes have to be considered. After each expiration action, more pathogens would be deposited on the contaminated surfaces. More pathogens would accumulate on the hand after each contact. The viability of the pathogen decays exponentially with time. Therefore, a nonlinear process should be considered. Nicas and Sun (13) have developed a Markov chain risk assessment model in which the indirect contact transmission is one of the exposure pathways. Their work has provided a foundation for this kind of research. Their model assumes a steady-state pathogen load on the contaminated surfaces for simplicity. Nicas and Best (14) have developed a model assessing the indirect contact transmission risk by considering an average pathogen load on hand. Atkinson and Wein (2) have developed an indirect contact transmission model with a simplification of assuming all the viruses on the susceptible hand to die off before each new hand contact of the contaminated surface. Wan et al. (5) used mathematical sequences to describe the indirect contact transmission process and to assess the exposure level. Wan et al. (15) used some integrals to replace some components in the mathematical sequences for simplification.",

Three pathogens capable to be transmitted via indirect contact were considered: influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus. Influenza can spread rapidly to susceptible people by both direct and indirect routes. Although droplet transmission is thought to be the primary mode of influenza transmission, there is also evidence to support indirect contact transmission of influenza. (16) RSV is the most important cause of respiratory infection in young children worldwide. (17) Although almost all children are vulnerable toward RSV, it can also infect adults. Rhinovirus is the most frequent cause of the common cold in both adults and children, which may cause serious respiratory tract disease and exacerbations of asthma. (18, 19) In this work, the indirect contact risks of these three diseases were assessed in two indoor environments, a hospital ward and an aircraft cabin. Nosocomial infections among patients and health-care workers frequently occur in hospital environments. Due to high occupant density, the aircraft cabin is another typical environment where infection of respiratory diseases easily spread. Given the focus on the relative magnitude of risk, the model of Wan et al. (5) was simplified. The results revealed and quantified the relative importance of different factors in indirect contact transmission and provided additional information for consideration on infection control and building environmental design.",

A validated numerical modeling scheme should be used. The amount of deposited expiratory aerosols can also be obtained by conducting experiments: tracer particles are injected into the premises in study to simulate the expiratory aerosols and the particles deposited on the susceptible surface are then extracted and measured for number counts.

Knowing the amount of expiratory aerosols deposited on the contaminated surface, the pathogen load on the surface can be calculated by multiplying the volume of the expiratory droplets by the pathogen concentration in the respiratory fluid and factoring with the loss of viability of the pathogen due to the desiccation effect during aerosolization.

To evaluate the significance of contact frequencies on the risk of indirect contact transmission, the infection risks of the health-care worker were also assessed under a doubled hand-tocontaminated-surfaces contact frequency and handto-mucous-membranes contact frequency for comparison. Indirect contact transmission risks of the health-care worker were also compared between contacting fabric and nonfabric contaminated surfaces to evaluate the significance of indoor surface material on this transmission mode. In Table III , the transfer efficiencies of pathogens from the contaminant surface to the finger pad and the decay rate of the pathogens on the surface are further classified into data for fabric materials (or porous materials) and nonfabric materials (or nonporous materials). Effect of the material type on the quantity of infectious particle deposition will be discussed in the next section. The pathogen transfer efficiency from the contaminated surface to the hand, c h in Table III , was further factored by the ratio of the finger pad area to the contaminated surface area. In this study, the finger pad area was taken as 6.5 cm 2 . Table IV shows the infection risks of the patients and the health-care worker in the hospital ward scenario under 6 and 11.6 ACH. It was expected that the infection risks to the diseases should generally increase with the reduction of the ACH in the ward because a higher ventilation rate should more efficiently dilute the infectious particles and remove them from the indoor environment before they can deposit on the surfaces. However, this was not always observed. In the upward cough case, when the ventilation rate was nearly doubled, the infection risks of patient M1 and the health-care worker to the three diseases were reduced by 9.5%, but the infection risks of patient M3 to the three diseases were increased by 7.9%. In the lateral cough case, when the ventilation rate was nearly doubled, the infection risks of patient M1 and the health-care worker to the three diseases were also increased by 31.1%. Changing the air exchange rate changes advection and turbulence, thus changing the deposition patterns of infectious particles. Under the higher ventilation rate, more infectious particles were dispersed to some positions by the stronger air flow. Therefore, more pathogens were deposited on the surfaces around these positions in the higher ACH case, Transfer efficiency of influenza virus to finger pad from handkerchiefs and paper facial tissue (9) 0.000126",

When the ventilation rate was nearly doubled, the average infection risk among the patients and health-care worker to the three diseases in the upward cough case was reduced by 3.7%, but was increased by 16.2% in the lateral cough case. Table V shows the infection risks of the passengers in the aircraft cabin scenario after a 4-hour flight under 9.8 and 19.5 ACH. Out of the 20 susceptible passengers, 12 passengers had reduced infection risks to the three diseases when the ventilation rate in the cabin was nearly doubled. In contrast, the other eight passengers, seated at A6, B6, C7, A3, B3, C3, B1, and C1, had increased infection risks to the three diseases when the ventilation rate in the cabin was nearly doubled. This was also due to the air flow under the higher ACH bringing more infectious particles to some regions in the cabin. Therefore, the particle deposition on some surfaces in these regions increased, resulting in higher pathogen loads on these contaminated surfaces. Doubling the ventilation rate reduced the average infection risk of the susceptible passengers to the three diseases by about 5.6%.",

It has been conclusively recognized that higher ventilation rate has an advantage in reducing the infection risk of respiratory diseases by airborne transmission. However, from the results of the current study, the indirect contact transmission risks were not always reduced when ventilation rate is increased in some cases. Doubling the ventilation rate only decreases the average risk by less than 20%. In a previous study, the infection risk through airborne transmission was decreased by 41% on average when the ventilation rate was nearly doubled, (5) indicating that ventilation rate has a lower significance on indirect contact transmission than it does on airborne transmission. In both environments, there were some susceptibles who had higher infection risks under a higher ventilation rate. As the air flow pattern under different ventilation rates are different, increase in ventilation rate may disperse more infectious particles to some regions in the premises and outweigh the dilution effect in these regions. One experimental study also found that higher ventilation rate might increase the exposure level of respiratory pathogens for some susceptibles located further away from the sources due to the same reason. (36) Table VI shows the infection risks of the healthcare worker in the hospital ward scenario under two hand-to-contaminated-surface contact frequencies. The health-care worker was considered to contact the blanket on patient M1 in the 11.6 ACH, index patient coughing upward case. By doubling the handto-contaminated-surface contact frequency, the infection risk of the health-care worker increased by 34.4% for influenza A virus, 94.2% for RSV, and 71.2% for rhinovirus.",

During the observation, very diverse personal behaviors were found. Some participants kept repeating eye-rubbing and nose-picking activities; others rarely touched their eyes, mouths, or noses. For those participants who tend to touch their mucous frequently, their infection risk would obviously be higher. For comparison purpose, every susceptible person was considered to have the same contact frequency. The three pathogens showed different sensitivities of indirect contact transmission risk to contact frequency. As the contact frequencies are nonlinearly related to the exposure, the variation of risk among the three diseases was larger when the contact frequencies were nearly doubled than when the ventilation rates were nearly doubled. The contact frequencies were found to have more significant effect on the risk of indirect contact transmission than the ventilation rate. Therefore, it is more effective to lower the infection risk via indirect contact transmission by reducing the hand contacts than controlling the ventilation rate. Table VII shows the infection risk comparison between different fabric and nonfabric surface materials. The health-care worker was considered to contact the blanket on patient M1 in the 11.6 ACH, index patient coughing upward case. The pathogen transfer fraction and survival on nonfabric material surface data are shown in Table III . If the surface contacted by the health-care worker was a nonfabric instead of a fabric surface, his/her infection risks would be increased by 13.9% for influenza A virus, 1,820.8% for RSV, and 4,154.0% for rhinovirus. The huge differences for RSV and rhinovirus were due to the large differences in survival on surface and transfer fraction, respectively, between fabric and nonfabric surface materials. From the literature data we found, RSV decay rate on nonfabric material is three orders of magnitude lower than that on fabric material and rhinovirus transfer fraction from nonfabric surface is three orders of magnitude higher than that from fabric material. These properties made nonfabric material much more effective in the indirect contact transmission of RSV and rhinovirus.",

(37) found that the particle deposition rate on fabric material (wallpaper) was higher than some nonfabric materials, such as wood and stainless steel, but lower than other nonfabric materials, such as cement paint and PVC. Another study by Thatcher et al. (38) showed that the particle deposition rate in a carpeted room was about double of the rate in a room with bare surfaces. If a doubled pathogen load on a fabric surface was considered to cater for the particle deposition rate difference, the infection risk for contacting fabric material would be approximately doubled. Contacting fabric materials would result in a higher indirect contact transmission risk toward influenza A virus than contacting nonfabric materials. However, due to the much higher pathogen transfer efficiencies and better survival rates of RSV and rhinovirus on nonfabric materials, infection risks of these two diseases of contacting nonfabric materials were still a few orders of magnitude higher than the infection risk of contacting fabric materials. Therefore, contacting nonfabric materials still resulted in a much higher indirect contact transmission risk in the cases of RSV and rhinovirus.",

In addition, the cases considered had not covered every possible surface that the occupants might contact. For comparison purpose, the current study also has not considered the complicated stochastic factors in the risk assessment, for example, the distribution of hand contact frequency among the susceptible individuals. For simplicity and comparison purpose, in the two environments, the occupants were considered touching certain surfaces with a set of assumed contact frequencies. It is possible that the settings did not cover every possible surface that the occupants might contact. When a different surface is considered, it can be considered as a different pathogen load being input into the risk assessment model. Thus, the choice of surfaces contacted by occupants will not affect the percentage differences of the assessed risks when varying the contact frequencies and the surface material, hence the outcome of comparison, in any significant way. The choice of surfaces contacted by occupants, however, may affect the percentage difference of the risks when varying the air change rate, since increase in air exchange rate does not uniformly decrease the pathogen load on all surfaces. The current choice of surfaces contacted by occupants was able to show the relative significances between different risk factors, and to show that increase in air exchange rate does not uniformly decrease exposure and risk.",

            "text": "Quantitative infection risk assessments were conducted on three pathogens and in two different environments to evaluate the significance of differ-ent factors in indirect contact transmission of respiratory infection in indoor environment. Generally, the indoor surface material was found to be the most significant influencing factor in the indirect contact transmission risk for at least two pathogens out of the three; human behavior-the frequencies of hand contacts-could also affect the indirect contact transmission risks of the three pathogens significantly; ventilation rate was found to be least significant in indirect contact transmission among these three factors, whereas in some situations increase in ventilation rate was also found to increase the risks of some susceptible persons. Although the air pollutant concentration in a building will decrease when ventilation rate is increased, the air pollutant is not perfectly mixed and the change in ventilation rate in a room will change the airflow pattern as well. Thus, airflow under an increased ventilation rate may transport more pollutant to some regions in a room. If there are occupants in these regions, their exposure and risk to the air pollutant will be higher than that in the lower ventilation rate case. In case of particulate matter, more particles may be transported to some regions and deposited onto surfaces around these regions under a different ventilation rate. This was observed in the experimental and numerical results from the previous studies. (5, 26) Therefore, increase in ventilation rate does not necessarily reduce the risks of all routes of transmission. Reducing the hand contact rates on contaminant surfaces and mucous membranes could reduce the infection risk significantly. Therefore, reducing unnecessary hand contacts on surface and on eyes and nose are important personal hygiene practices. Fabric material contributes much lower risk than nonfabric material for RSV and rhinovirus. The risk of indirect contact transmission could be up to three orders of magnitude higher when contacting contaminated nonfabric surface than contacting contaminated fabric surface. However, choice of indoor surface material also affects the indoor concentrations of other pollutants. Therefore, the current results alone do not lead to the conclusion that fabric material should always be used as indoor",
