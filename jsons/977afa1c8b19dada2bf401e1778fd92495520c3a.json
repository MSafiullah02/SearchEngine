This, in combination with the importance of Greylags as a hunting target, has called for demographic estimates for the population to assist in management decisions. To this end, we analysed long-term mark-recapture data using Cormack-Jolly-Seber models embedded in program MARK to obtain survival estimates for the population. No sex-specific difference, or age effect on survival after juveniles had completed their first migration (3 months of age), was evident. Mean first-year survival was reported as 0.485 and annual survival of older birds as 0.700. On a monthly basis, survival in Greylags during summer and winter was very similar over the study period. A significant linear decline in winter survival from 0.909 to 0.807 was, however, apparent during the study period. Over the second half of the study (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002), summer survival was about 3% lower than in the first half (1986-94) but no linear relationship was evident. We found a significant inverse relationship between Greylag survival during summer and latitudinal distribution in Norway. A similar relationship was evident between survival and annual bag numbers.

Juvenile survival was not correlated with survival of older birds over the same time, suggesting that different regulating factors govern survival in these two population groups. Goslings and adults are likely to suffer similar hunting mortality, but mortality incurred during the autumn migration could be much more variable in goslings. Both body condition prior to the migration and unfavourable weather conditions during the migration are likely to have a greater influence on goslings than on older birds. On the breeding grounds, goslings are flightless for an extended period when they are susceptible to predators, mainly the White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla and Great Black-backed Gull Larus marinus. Predation is, however, likely to be most substantial prior to goslings being marked, at which time they are much smaller than the adults.

Although we do not have sufficient data to determine how the decline in adult survival has affected the population growth rate, we would expect that with the reduced survival observed over the latter half of this study, the population would not have been on the increase during this period and could well have been in decline.
