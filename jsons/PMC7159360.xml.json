Despite this finding, we have continued to advocate the use of specific virologic diagnostics instead of clinical differentiation. In a recently published study that was performed among adults with symptoms of respiratory infection, it was concluded that clinical differentiation between patients with and without influenza infection based solely on influenza\u2010like signs and symptoms is rather ineffective (10). It is very plausible that this also holds true for a paediatric population. Furthermore, our results have shown that H1N1\u2010positive children, both in\u2010 and outpatients, were significantly older than their H1N1\u2010negative counterparts. The lower age of H1N1\u2010negative children is probably best explained by a selection bias of relatively healthy infants and young children brought to the hospital by parents who were concerned by the pandemic. Finally, from our results, it seems that certain pre\u2010existing comorbid conditions in children, particularly asthmatic bronchitis, had not been a risk factor for a more complicated course of the infection, unlike findings from other observational studies (6, 11, 12).",

In the course of the next month, the relative H1N1\u2010positivity rate declined; however, the absolute number of visiting patients increased dramatically. In November 2009, the Health Council advice was changed, and it was recommended that all children from the ages of 6 months to 4 years be vaccinated, regardless of risk group. A mass vaccination program was therefore organized in November and December, after which a definite decline in the number of visiting patients was seen. In Amsterdam and surrounding area, this had resulted in a total vaccination coverage rate in children of approximately 40% (14). Based on this coverage rate, and taking into account that mass vaccination was started after the peak of the epidemic, it is estimated that maximally 10\u201320% of our outpatient children had received the vaccine.",

Severe cases of complicated influenza infection might therefore directly have been referred to one of Amsterdam\u2019s 2 PICU\u2010containing university hospitals. A second limitation is that we restricted the RT\u2010PCR analyses to eight viral and three \u2018bacterial\u2019 pathogens, and we did not routinely test for notable bacterial organisms, such as Group A Streptococcus. Finally, two different sampling methods had been used. Oropharyngeal swabs were performed in the majority of our children; in a minority nasal washes were performed. Comparative studies have shown that the sensitivity for the identification of respiratory viruses is lower for oropharyngeal swabs (28, 29, 30). There is therefore a possibility that our results are an underestimation of the real situation, particularly in older children in whom oropharyngeal swabs were preferably collected.",

Causative respiratory pathogens were detected in a majority of children visiting our clinic. In one\u2010third of the outpatients, we identified pandemic influenza A(H1N1). Of all children, the vast majority showed a mild clinical illness. The use of oseltamivir was discontinued in high\u2010risk children who ultimately proved H1N1\u2010negative, which is considered a valuable advantage of testing symptomatic outpatient children.",
