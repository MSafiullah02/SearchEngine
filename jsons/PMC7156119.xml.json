Over 80 thousand of people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 until March 6, showing that SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. Coronavirus is a type of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus [1], including the well-known Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome (\u223c29%), acute cardiac injury (\u223c12%) or acute kidney injury (\u223c7%) [2], implying that SARS-CoV-2 may infect various human tissues.",

            "text": "Viruses bind to host receptors on target cell surface to establish infection. Membrane proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses [3]. As recently reported, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV could use ACE2 protein to gain entry into the cells [4,5]. Since the outbreak, many data analysis have showed a wide distribution of ACE2 across human tissues, including lung, liver, stomach, ileum, colon and kidney [6], indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may infect multiple organs. However, these data showed that AT2 cell (the main target cell of SARS-CoV-2) in the lung actually expressed rather low levels of ACE2 [6]. Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 may depends on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection. It is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors [7]. For example, Hoffmann et al. recently showed that SARS-CoV-2-S uses ACE2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming [5], showing that SARS-CoV-2 infections also require multiple factors. Understanding the receptors usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. Therefore, identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for SARS-CoV-2 is of great significance.",

The findings show that 94 genes are significantly correlated with ACE2 (P < 0.01) in a manner of gene expression. Of note, ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are the top three genes correlated with ACE2 (R > 0.8) (Fig. 2\n). ANPEP, alanyl aminopeptidase, is a host receptor targeted by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, human coronavirus 229E, feline coronavirus, canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and infectious bronchitis virus. These viruses all belong to Coronaviridae. ANPEP mainly expresses in colon, ileum, rectum, kidney, liver and skin (figs3 & figs4), demonstrating that receptor of coronavirus may have similar expression profiles in human body. ENPEP, Glutamyl Aminopeptidase, belongs to the peptidase M1 family which is the mammalian type II integral membrane zinc-containing endopeptidases. ENPEP regulates blood pressure regulation and blood vessel formation through the catabolic pathway of the renin-angiotensin system [23]. The relationship between ENPEP and viral infection is unknown. DPP4, the receptor of MERS-CoV, shows expression similarity with ACE2, except that DPP4 expresses in some T cells of all the observed tissues (figs3 & figs4). All of the three genes encode peptidase, which are uniquely adopted by coronavirus as their receptors [24]. This result raised the possibility that ENPEP may be another yet unknown receptor for coronavirus. To further consolidate the findings, we calculated the Euclidean distance between all the curated proteins and constructed their hierarchy relationships across the 119 cell types. DPP4 was the first gene clustered with ACE2.",

            "text": "The viruses target host cells via binding host receptors before engaging the infection cycle. ACE2 was proved to be the cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the same receptor as SARS-CoV. The expression profiles of ACE2 across different cell types of different organs will reveal clues of the virus transmission routes and its potential pathogenesis. In previous studies, ACE2 was found to express in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, alveolar type II cells in lung, liver cholangiocyte and kidney proximal tubules. These findings suggested that the clinical symptoms of hepatic failure, respiratory injury, acute kidney injury or diarrhoea may be associated with the pervasive ACE2 expressing cells in these tissues. However, we and others found that ACE2 is lowly expressed, especially in the lung (the main target organ of nCoVs), raising the possible existence of co-receptors facilitating nCoV infection. It is well recognized that ssRNA viruses tend to have multiple receptors [7]. For example, ACE2, CD209 (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing Non-Integrin 1), CLEC4G (C-type lectin domain family 4 member G) and CLEC4M (C-type lectin domain family 4 member M) are receptors of SARS-CoV [[28], [29], [30], [31]]. In addition, other membrane proteins may also assist virus entry [3]. Since the viral receptor and co-receptors should be co-expressed on the same cell types, we analyzed single cell co-expression patterns covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors in this study. After calculating their gene expression similarity, we found ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are top three genes correlated with ACE4 (R > 0.8). Interestingly, both ANPEP and DPP4 are viral receptors of human coronaviruses [32], while ENPEP is also a peptidase, despite that its involvement in virus infection is unclear. For mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors [24]. Now, we showed co-expression profiles of these molecules, indicating that different human CoVs actually target the similar cell types across different human tissues. It also explains why, patients infected with different human CoVs manifest similar clinical symptoms. We propose that further experimental validations should be performed to explore the role of these peptidase in SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs infection.",

The interferons also act on warning the neighboring cells of virus attack. It can signify the nearby cells to upregulate MHC class I molecules to notify the CD8+ T cells to identify and eliminate the viral infection [36,37]. Understand the potential cell-cell communication mechanisms across different tissues is important for understanding immune reactions. In this study, we investigated the cells communicated with CoVs-targets (ACE2-expressing cells) in each tissue. Our results illustrate that macrophages frequently crosstalk with the ACE2-expressing cells, in lung, liver and stomach etc. This suggests that macrophages play the sentinel role during human CoVs infection. Future studies should investigate these signaling pairs in the setting of CoVs infection in patients and animal models.",
