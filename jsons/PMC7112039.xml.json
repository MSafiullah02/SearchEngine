            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was retrospectively first recognized in Guangdong, the southern province of China, in November 2002 [1]. Spreading through travelers, major outbreaks occurred in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. Globally, 8422 people were infected with 916 deaths and a case fatality ratio of 11% [2]. After successful termination of the outbreak in July 2003, sporadic zoonotic or laboratory-acquired cases had occurred. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV has not been identified, but a number of wildlife species, including the masked palm civet, have shown laboratory evidence of infection with a related coronavirus [1]. The first documented human outbreak of avian influenza occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, with 18 persons infected and 6 deaths [3]. The etiologic agent was a highly pathogenic avian influenza A subtype H5N1. Human diseases were reported again from Hong Kong in 2003 [4]. From late 2003, human diseases became persistent in Southeast Asia. As of December 30, 2005, a total of 142 cases with 74 deaths were reported, and the case fatality ratio was 52% [5]. The countries with confirmed cases include Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and China. From late 2005, animal cases of H5N1 were also reported from Russia, Romania, Turkey, and other European countries. At the time of writing this article, the first documented human case outside Asia was reported in Turkey. The strains of the H5N1 in these outbreaks may not be identical, but they are all highly pathogenic. Both SARS and avian influenza cause severe respiratory tract infection. Their rapid and definitive diagnosis is required both for proper management of the patients and for public health implication. The purpose of this study is to review and compare the anatomical pathology of SARS and H5N1 based on the published literature. The findings on a few cases of SARS and H5N1 examined by the authors were incorporated in this report and used in the illustration figures.",

The terms used in the search were combination of severe acute respiratory syndrome or avian influenza (as subject heading) and pathology (as keyword but not subject heading). Original pathology reports were the primary target of this review, but clinical reports with pathology findings were also included if contributory. All the English full-text reports were retrieved and reviewed. A few original pathology reports in Chinese were excluded. The pathology of the 2 diseases was separately summarized and then compared. The pathology material on 2 postmortem cases of SARS, 1 liver biopsy from a patient with SARS, and 2 full postmortem cases of H5N1 examined by the authors were incorporated in this review and used in the figures, which are newly taken photomicrographs. These cases have all been previously reported. The pathology material used in the illustration was from standard paraffin blocks processed for hematoxylin and eosin sections. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded sections were used. The antigen retrieval process was done by wet heating of sections in a pressure cooker. The primary antibodies used were from mouse and the secondary antibody was from rabbit. The reaction was detected by a peroxidase method using the DAKO detection kit on DAKO Cytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). The manufacturer and dilution of the antibodies used were as follows: CD3, DAKO, 1:150; CD20, DAKO, 1:750; CD30, DAKO, 1:5; CD56, ZYMED, 1:250; CD68, DAKOPATTS, 1:2500; AE1/AE3, DAKO, 1:30.",

There were a few reports on other specific organ systems affected by SARS-CoV including liver [15], gastrointestinal tract [16], skeletal muscle [17], kidney [18] and hematolymphoid organs [19]. The major findings of these series are summarized in Table 1\n. There were also a number of reports on the immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, and ultrastructural localization of SARS-CoV in pathologic specimens [20], [21], [22]. The 2 SARS cases used in the illustration were reported in a clinical article [23] and as one of the cases of reference [6]. In total, the pulmonary and general pathologic review of SARS included 62 patients based on the first 8 series in Table 1 plus author's cases. Apart from lung biopsies from 4 live patients, all materials were from postmortem cases. There were 38 men and 24 women with an average age of 59.6 years (range, 25-99 years). The age groupings by 10s were 2 for twenties, 8 for thirties, 8 for forties, 7 for fifties, 12 for sixties, and 16 for those 70 years or older (n = 53, excluding 9 with age not mentioned). The average duration from symptom onset to death was 19.5 days (median, 16 days; range, 4-108 days; n = 62). The distribution of death by weeks of disease duration was 6 for week 1, 16 for week 2, 20 for week 3, 7 for week 4, and 6 for week 5 or longer (n = 55).",

            "text": "Only a few reports recorded the amount of pleural effusion and the gross lung weight [6], [7], [13]. Straw color or hemorrhagic pleural effusion from 50 to 400 mL in each pleural cavity was noted. Gross lung weight of more than 1000 g on each side was commonly recorded with the highest documented weight of 2100 g [6]. However, lung weight down to 600 to 650 g on each side was also recorded. A lower lung weight occurred more commonly in patients dying in the first week or from coexisting diseases. The lungs grossly showed varying degree of congestion, edema, and consolidation. The pulmonary pathology reported was diffuse alveolar damage with varied terminology used, including acute or exudative phase, proliferative, or organizing phase and fibrotic phase. In general, patients in the initial 10 days of illness showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in the acute or exudative phase including hyaline membrane formation (Fig. 1A). The major inflammatory cells in the alveoli were variably described as mixed inflammatory (Fig. 1B) or predominantly histiocytic. The earliest pulmonary findings were reported by Franks et al [12] on 2 patients at days 4 and 6 of illness with focal (<50%) and diffuse (>50%) acute DAD, respectively. Several authors had emphasized the focal nature of DAD in the initial 10 days and the diagnostic uncertainty especially on a biopsy specimen [6], [8], [11], [13]. Proliferative or organizing changes with progression to fibrosis were noted in patients beyond day 10 (Fig. 1C and D). Even in these patients, the DAD could be patchy, but with a tendency for more diffuse involvement. Features of organizing DAD commonly coexisted with acute DAD in different parts of the lung (Fig. 1A, C, and D). Cheung examined 3 patients from day 29 to 46 and noted organizing and fibrotic DAD. Acute DAD was no longer seen except for a few remnant hyaline membranes [8]. The term bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)\u2013like pattern was used by 3 authors including ourselves and 7 of the 14 studied cases showed such pattern (Fig. 1D) [6], [7]. Hwang et al [14] reported the acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern as predominating in 6 of his 20 cases and in patients after day 20 of illness. This pattern of intra-alveolar fibrin balls and organizing pneumonia was first described by Beasley et al [24] as distinct from DAD and BOOP. The significance of this pattern is uncertain as it may be a variant of DAD. The lack of description of this pattern by other authors of SARS series may be because of inclusion of this pattern as a variant of DAD. Review of the 2 cases examined by the authors showed the coexistence of this pattern with other features of organizing DAD in one case. Multinucleated pneumocytes (Fig. 1E1) and histiocytes (Fig. 1E2) were documented in about 66%, but these could be absent or scanty. Atypical and enlarged pneumocytes with multinucleation, prominent nucleoli, chromatin clearing, and ample amphophilic granular cytoplasm had been well described by several authors [6], [7], [10], [12]. These cells were suspected to harbor the SARS-CoV. However, viral inclusion was not evident. Regenerative hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes was prominent from the organizing phase (Fig. 1F). Other pathologic features included squamous metaplasia of respiratory epithelium, fibrin thrombi in pulmonary vessels, and focal honeycomb fibrosis. Complicating bronchopneumonia was noted in 13 patients (~21%), and superinfection by bacteria, fungus, and CMV was noted. The authors studied the immunoprofiles of the lymphoid cells in the lungs on 2 cases. In one patient who had not been given high-dose corticosteroid, the lymphoid cells were more abundant including both CD3-reactive T cells and CD20-reactive B cells. CD8-reactive T suppressor-cytotoxic cells appeared more than CD4-reactive T helper-inducer cells. CD30-reactive activated lymphoid cells were rare and CD56-reactive natural killer cells were absent. For the other patient treated with high-dose corticosteroid, the inflammatory infiltrate was significantly less but the cell types were similar.",

In the 2 cases studied by the authors, hemophagocytic syndrome in the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes and bone marrow were noted (Fig. 2A and B). The study by Wong et al [19] on 4 autopsied cases showed no hemophagocytic syndrome. Lymphoid depletion in the spleen (Fig. 2C) and lymph node were noted by several authors [6], [10], [11], [14], [19]. Focal necrosis or apoptosis in lymph nodes and spleen was reported by Lang et al [9] and Ding et al [10]. Although diarrhea and fecal excretion of SARS-CoV were common, biopsied or autopsied material showed no pathologic changes in the gastrointestinal tract. However, active viral replication in both small and large intestinal enterocytes was demonstrated [16]. Chau et al [15] reported SARS-CoV\u2013associated hepatitis in 3 patients with accumulation of mitosis and apoptosis (Fig. 2F) and positive RT-PCR result on the liver tissue. Such hepatitis was not observed in the autopsied series. Leung et al [17] reported myopathic changes (Fig. 2D) associated with SARS in a postmortem series of 8 cases. However, direct invasion of skeletal muscle by SARS-CoV was not evident. Acute tubular necrosis of the kidneys (Fig. 2E) was reported by several authors [10], [13], [18]. Systemic vasculitis was described by Ding, but the illustration showed leukocytes margination and stasis with no definite destruction of vascular wall. Vasculitis was not reported by the other authors. No specific changes were noted in the other organs. Macrovesicular steatosis and centrilobular necrosis of liver, ischemic necrosis of heart, and adrenal hemorrhage were considered nonspecific features related to hypoxemia and shock. Myocarditis was not seen. The brains of the 2 cases studied by the authors showed no encephalitis or specific changes. In one of our cases, RT-PCR, viral culture, and EM of the kidney were positive for SARS-CoV, but RT-PCR of the liver and bone marrow was negative. By in situ hybridization and other techniques, SARS-CoV was localized to pneumocytes, macrophages, and enterocytes [20], [21]. Ding et al [22] reported a more broad distribution in other organs but was not confirmed by others. In a clinical article, positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV was reported from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with SARS after a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion, whereas the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV of the concurrent serum was negative [25].",

For the outbreak in Southeast Asia, pathologic findings were reported on 5 fatal cases from Thailand [27], [28], [29], [30]. Thus, this review consisted of only 8 patients, which are summarized in Table 2\n. The pathologic material used in the illustration was from cases 1 and 3, which were examined by the authors. Thus, there is a severe limitation on the pathologic data available for H5N1. The gross pulmonary findings showed extensive consolidation with varying degree of hemorrhage. In a fatal case on day 10 (case 3), the lungs were reddish brown, solid, and weighed more than 1000 g (right, 1170 g; left, 1020 g). There was also bilateral lightly blood-stained effusion (right, 700 mL; left, 900 mL). The pulmonary pathology was diffuse alveolar damage plus interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis. The DAD was in the acute exudative phase (Fig. 3A and B) for patients dying in the first 2 weeks and was in organizing phase (Fig. 3D and E) for patients dying in the third week or later. In the acute phase, the major cell types in the alveoli were macrophages, neutrophil, and activated lymphocyte (Fig. 3C). Necrotizing alveoli were noted in the acute phase (Fig. 3B), and the destruction of alveoli explained the patchy fibrosis without regenerating pneumocytes (Fig. 3D and F). There was also interstitial fibrosis. The fibrosis appeared hyaline and paucicellular. Specifically, intra-alveolar fibrosis with a BOOP-like pattern was not observed, in contrast to that of SARS (Fig. 1C, D, and F). Reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes was present in the organizing phase (Fig. 3F) and viral inclusion was absent. Multinucleated cells were not described. Bronchiolitis with squamous metaplasia was seen. Honeycomb dilatation was noted in a patient dying at 1 month (case 1). Superinfection by aspergillosis was noted in 1 patient (case 5). The authors studied the immunophenotypes of the lymphoid cells in the lungs of case 3. CD3-reactive T cells were more numerous than CD20-reactive B cells. CD4-reactive T helper-inducer cells appeared more than CD8-reactive T suppressor-cytotoxic cells. Some of the larger activated lymphoid cells were reactive with the activation marker CD30. These cells were also observed in the lymphoreticular system including the spleen (Fig. 4C), tonsil, and lymph node. In the lung, CD56-reactive natural killer cells were rare.",

Large activated lymphoid cells were present in the lymphoreticular system (Fig. 4A and C inset). The spleen showed atrophic white pulp and congested red pulp (Fig. 4C). The bone marrow varied from hypocellular (case 1) to hypercellular (cases 2 and 3). Extramedullary hemopoiesis was noted in the lymph node, spleen, and liver in 1 patient dying at 1 month (case 2). The liver showed mild macrovesicular steatosis. In 2 cases, centrilobular necrosis was noted (cases 1 and 2). Kupffer cell hyperplasia with occasional hemophagocytosis was also noted. Widespread microvesicular steatosis of Reye's syndrome was not observed. Acute tubular necrosis was noted in 3 cases (cases 1-3). Skeletal muscle fiber necrosis was documented in 2 cases (cases 1 and 3) (Fig. 4D). In the 13-year-old girl dying at 1 month (case 1), the cerebral white matter showed scattered microglial nodules with hemorrhage, rarefaction, demyelination, axon balls, and foamy or pigment-laden macrophages (Fig. 4E and F). However, no perivascular lymphocytic cuffing or ventriculitis was observed. Small foci of necrosis in the brain were also reported in the 6-year-old boy from Thailand (case 5). The brains of 2 adult cases examined were reported as normal (cases 2 and 3), except for lysis of the granular cells of the cerebellar cortex in one (case 3). No significant pathology was noted in the other organs. In particular, myocarditis was absent. Postmortem viral culture or RT-PCR was done on 5 cases (cases 1-5). Viral culture of the lung for the 2 patients dying at 1 month was negative (cases 1 and 2). Viral culture of the lung for case 3 dying at day 10 was positive for H5N1. Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction was done on the lung of case 4 and 5 dying at days 10 and 17, respectively, and both were positive. Viral culture or RT-PCR was done in other organs including the brain, kidney, liver, bone marrow, heart, intestine, lymph node, and spleen. These were all negative except for one case. For case 5, RT-PCR of small and large intestine and the spleen was positive for H5N1. The relevant investigators have also demonstrated positive-stranded viral RNA indicating viral replication only in the lung and intestine [29]. Another clinical article had reported a broader occurrence of H5N1 in other organs. A 4-year-old boy in Vietnam presented with diarrhea followed by encephalopathy and death [31]. H5N1 influenza virus was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid, rectal swab, throat, and serum specimens. This was actually the first report of isolation of H5N1 from extrapulmonary sites. Unfortunately, postmortem was not done and the pathology of the gastrointestinal tract and brain was unknown.",

The extensive pneumocyte destruction and the inflammatory and immune reaction elicited by the viruses cause diffuse alveolar damage. The activation of the cytokines is part of the immune reaction to eradicate the virus. The systemic cytokine activation results in reactive hemophagocytic syndrome in the lymphoreticular system and possibly also mediates other organ damage such as the skeletal muscle fiber necrosis. The lymphoid depletion in the spleen and lymph node in fatal cases may be due to combination of lymphoid necrosis and apoptosis and exhaustion of lymphoid proliferation in response to the cytokine overdrive. The acute tubular necrosis is likely to be the consequence of systemic hypoxia and shock rather than direct invasion of the viruses.",

Features of acute DAD are often seen in combination with reparative phase in different parts of the lung. In contrast, H5N1 shows more fulminant and rapidly progressive DAD. This is in keeping with the clinical observations. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in SARS is generally in the second week of the illness (first peak on day 11) [32], whereas that for H5N1 is at the end of the first week (median time, day 6) [30]. On histology, DAD shows common pathologic features and distinction of the etiologic agent is not possible. Furthermore, there is difficulty in confirming or excluding SARS in a lung biopsy in the early stage of disease because of its focal involvement and the nonspecific changes. The demonstration of SARS-CoV by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization in infected cells would be helpful. The presence of atypical multinucleated pneumocytes and multinucleated histiocytes is characteristic of SARS, and these cells are inconspicuous in H5N1. However, such changes are nonspecific because other viral infection such as respiratory syncytial virus and measles may also produce giant cells. Based on the pathologic description and figures in the published reports, the organizing phase of SARS appears quite fibrocellular and intra-alveolar with a BOOP-like pattern. This may explain the empirical success of high-dose corticosteroid in SARS because BOOP is known to respond to corticosteroid. However, in one case treated by high-dose corticosteroid studied by the authors, BOOP still occurred in a lesser extent. For H5N1, the pathologic data are limited. Based on the observation by the authors, the acute DAD appears more necrotizing and hemorrhagic. The alveolar destruction causes foci of fibrosis without pneumocytic regeneration. The organizing phase is also marked by interstitial fibrosis of a hyaline and paucicellular form without BOOP-like pattern.",

Until recently, the extrapulmonary isolation of H5N1 had been negative. There is recent documentation of isolation of H5N1 from the gastrointestinal tract, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood [29], [31]. As the virus H5N1 may undergo adaptational mutation to the new human host environment, wider pathologic targets in the human body may become possible. Biopsy and postmortem study of new human H5N1 cases are urgently needed for further elaboration. In ducks, H5N1 is a systemic disease affecting multiple organs including the central nervous system [33]. So far, evidence of cerebral involvement is noted in 2 autopsied cases (cases 1 and 5) and 1 clinical case [31].

The long persistence of SARS-CoV in the postmortem lung tissue indicated the failure of the drugs, including ribavirin, that had been used. The persistence of H5N1 in postmortem lung is also generally longer than human influenza virus. This is probably due to the lack of crossing reacting antibodies in the human host, unlike human influenza virus subtypes. The occasional report of the resistance of H5N1 virus to oseltamivir is a cause for concern [34]. The persistence of the virus also highlights the importance of precautions against infection during postmortem examination despite death after long clinical illness. Another key issue in the management of both SARS and H5N1 is to control or downgrade the inflammatory response in the DAD. However, as pointed out by Yuen et al [35], the use of immunomodulators may be counterproductive if their use would delay the eradication of the virus.",
