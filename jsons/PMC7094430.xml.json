Propionate and butyrate are the most important VFA for papillae growth (Tamate et al., 1962) and are products of the fermentation of grains. For this reason, grains (starches) are the most important component in a young calf\u2019s diet for inducing rumen development. Grains are frequently fed in a pelleted form with fine particle size because forming a firm pellet requires fine grinding of grains (Davis and Drackley, 1998), and when pelleted concentrates are the only solid feed available papillae have been shown to become parakeratotic, exhibiting abnormal growth and compaction with fine feed particles (McGavin and Morrill, 1976). The small particle size of many all-ground diets does not provide the necessary abrasiveness to remove the keratin layer and compacted feed from the developing rumen papillae. Greenwood et al. (1997) observed that keratinization of papillae was inversely related to the diet\u2019s abrasiveness when using a finely ground, pelletized diet.",

Diets with greater particle size resulted in higher rumen pH (Greenwood et al., 1997; Beharka et al., 1998), possibly due to an increase in the time calves spend ruminating as particle size increases (Hodgson, 1971), thereby affecting saliva production, which increases rumen buffering (Krause and Oetzel, 2006). Increasing starter particle size by feeding it in a coarse mash form versus ground and pelleted reduced the age at which calves started ruminating and increased the time spent ruminating (Porter et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Two common ways to increase the particle size of solid feed for the young calf are to feed a mix of whole grains or less processed grains and a supplemental pellet or to include forage in the ration. Studies by Beharka et al. (1998) and Greenwood et al. (1997) investigated the effects of increasing particle size without changing diet composition, at controlled DMI, and avoiding bedding consumption, at inclusions of 25% alfalfa hay (Beharka et al., 1998) and 15% bromegrass hay (Greenwood et al., 1997). Forage levels of 15 to 25% may be too high when feeding low-quality forage, as reports have shown that when calves have ad libitum access to straw consumption is about 4% of solid feed intake (Thomas and Hinks, 1982; Castells et al., 2013). Moreover, Fokkink et al. (2011) observed that straw intake decreased from about 4% of solid feed intake through 5 wk of age to about 1% from 5 to 8 wk in calves that had no access to consume bedding. Hence, high inclusion rates of forage (>10%) in the preweaned calf diet reduce the proportion of grains in the ration and may reduce starter intake, possibly lowering the production of VFA in the rumen which may slow down the development of the rumen epithelium. Stobo et al. (1966) observed that as concentrate intake increased (by increasing its allowance), papillae tended to be larger. However, other researchers have suggested that forage allowance may actually increase total DMI and that it could benefit rumen development (Khan et al., 2011; Castells et al., 2013). A small amount of forage with particle size >1.18 mm, which is the threshold particle size for particles leaving the rumen in adult cattle and sheep (Maulfair et al., 2011), may satisfy the calf\u2019s requirement for abrasiveness to avoid the buildup of keratin in the rumen epithelium and maintain a more stable rumen fermentation. When the particle size of starter was evaluated in calves fed no hay and without access to consume bedding materials up to 8 wk, it was determined that over 50% of particles should be larger than 1.19 mm to ensure adequate intake, proper rumen fermentation (Warner et al., 1973), and prevent physiological abnormalities (Porter et al., 2007).",

Calves were then transported for 20 min to the research facility where they were fed an additional 1.8 L of colostrum 6 to 8 h after the first feeding. Housing consisted of individual pens 2.1 \u00d7 1.6 m inside a mechanically ventilated, heated facility; bedding (wood shavings) was completely covered with landscape fabric to avoid any consumption of bedding, thus the only solid feed available came from treatment diets. Water was offered free choice, and a commercial milk replacer powder containing 20% CP and 20% fat (US Feeds, Eldora, IA) and reconstituted to 13% DM was fed at 12% of birth BW divided in 2 equal feedings per day. Decoquinate (Deccox-M; Alpharma, Bridgewater, NJ) was added to milk replacer to feed at 0.5 mg/kg of BW. At 7 wk of age, milk replacer allowance was cut to 6% of birth BW for 1 wk before weaning. Calves were randomly assigned based on date and birth BW to 1 of 4 treatments differing in geometric mean particle length (Xgm) of straw comprising 5% of starter DM. Straw was provided within the pellet (PS; 0.82 mm Xgm) or mixed with the pellet at Xgm of 3.04 mm (SS), 7.10 mm (MS) or 12.7 mm (LS) at time of feeding. Calves (3/treatment) were ruminally fistulated with 28-mm (i.d.) rubber cannulas by wk 2 of life in a similar manner as Lesmeister and Heinrichs (2004). Pellets and straw for treatments SS, MS, and LS were proportionally mixed for each calf daily. The 2 pellets were manufactured with all ingredients coming from the same batch and in enough quantity for both trials. The pellets were made under ambient conditions without added steam. The meal was conditioned for approximately 20 s with 75\u00b0C forced, ambient air and pelleted at 200 kPa at 75\u00b0C. Calf starter was fed once daily at 2000 h after milk replacer feeding; the amount of starter offered was adjusted with age and was based on average intakes of calves fed similar milk replacer diets. To equalize intake, calves were fed a fixed amount of starter that changed with age and was determined by previous experiences with calves on similar milk replacer diets and by the voluntary consumption of most calves; orts were fed through the cannula in cannulated calves, except during the last week of the experiment. The different lengths of straw were obtained by chopping wheat straw and sieving it in the ASABE (2007) particle size separator equipped with 5 screens (nominal size opening 19, 12.7, 6.3, 3.96, and 1.17 mm for 1 to 5 respectively) and a bottom pan, particles in the bottom pan were used for PS, and particles retained on screens 5, 4, and 3 for treatments SS, MS, and LS respectively.

            "text": "Rumen fermentation data comes from 12 fistulated calves (3/treatment) in trial 1 and is presented in\nTable 4. Rumen pH decreased linearly with age (Figure 1), and the overall value for SS was lower than that of PS and MS (5.81 PS; 5.50 SS; 5.75 MS; 5.62 LS; cubic effect, P\n < 0.05). This cubic effect of diet is different from our hypothesis, as we expected pH to increase linearly as particle size increased. Possibly, intake in wk 6 influenced pH and is responsible for the cubic effect, as PS and MS had higher intakes in wk 6. Beharka et al. (1998) observed an increase in rumen pH for larger particle size when comparing ground versus unground diets. Particle size differences in their study were larger, as forage constituted 25% of the starter and grains were also ground or unground; these may be reasons why particle size had a greater effect on rumen pH. Greenwood et al. (1997) also observed higher rumen pH with diets greater in particle size when forage constituted 15% of starter. The decline in pH with age is consistent with Suarez-Mena et al. (2015), where calves were fed grain for 4 wk. When calves were studied for a longer period of time, Anderson et al. (1987) and Beharka et al. (1998) reported a quadratic response of pH to age, but it declined consistently for about 6 wk. As shown in Figure 1, the decline in pH with age is responsive to solid feed intake increasing by wk.\nFigure 2 illustrates pH variation over time after feeding grain; a nadir was reached at approximately 2 h postfeeding for wk 2 and 6, and at 4 h for wk 1, 3, 4, and 5. The postprandial pH variation is comparable to what we observed in a previous study with similar management (Suarez-Mena et al., 2015). Anderson et al. (1987) observed lowest pH values 1 to 3 h postfeeding and a faster recovery to prefeeding values than in the present study; at its nadir average pH was over 5, which was higher than what we observed in the present study. The pH values observed by Laarman et al. (2012) are also higher than in our study; however, calves had ad libitum access to forage and were older. Although not specified, calves in Anderson et al. (1987) may have also had access to bedding, as they were housed in calf hutches. At the end of wk 5, fistulated calves (n = 5) showed clinical signs of acidosis: anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea (Owens et al., 1998), and abdominal discomfort. Differences in pH were analyzed for calves with acidosis symptoms versus calves not showing these symptoms, and it was determined that, on wk 5, pH of calves showing signs of acidosis declined up to 8 h after feeding versus 2 h after feeding for calves not showing acidosis symptoms (\nFigure 3). As none of the nonfistulated calves in either trial showed these symptoms at that age, it is likely that our attempt to equalize intake by feeding orts through the cannula created acidosis in these calves. The 5 calves showing these symptoms were often fed through the cannula, and the amounts that were fed through the cannula as calves aged was likely too large and overwhelmed the ability of these calves to maintain pH. Furthermore, starter introduced through the cannula was not chewed, so it did not contribute to the flow of saliva with its buffering compounds to the rumen. Potential carryover effects of low pH on performance and health cannot be determined from our study.",

            "text": "Total rumen VFA concentration did not differ by diet, but a diet by week interaction was observed where PS had lower concentration than SS and LS in wk 5 and lower than SS in wk 6. As with pH, these observations may be related to solid feed intake differences in wk 6. Greater rumen VFA concentration with smaller particle size was reported by Coverdale et al. (2004), and Beharka et al. (1998), although the latter was a numerical difference only (P\n = 0.12). In both studies, calves fed smaller particle size rations had increased keratinization of the rumen papillae, which has been shown to reduce the amount of VFA absorption (Hinders and Owen, 1965). In our previous study (Suarez-Mena et al., 2015) and in the Greenwood et al. (1997) study, particle size of diets did not affect VFA concentration. Total concentration of VFA in the rumen increased with age as has been reported by earlier studies (Greenwood et al., 1997; Beharka et al., 1998; Coverdale et al., 2004). In our previous study (Suarez-Mena et al., 2015), rumen VFA concentration increased with age in a quadratic trend with a small decrease at wk 4, which is somewhat similar to the current study where a plateau was observed between wk 3 and 5 and then an increase at wk 6. The decrease observed in Suarez-Mena et al. (2015) and plateau in the current study are likely an effect of greater VFA absorption, because intake increased with time and it is assumed VFA production increases with greater intake. Total rumen VFA postprandial variation (\nFigure 4), was consistent with previous reports (Anderson et al., 1987; Quigley et al., 1992; Suarez-Mena et al., 2015), with peaks between 2 and 4 h after feeding when pH was at its lowest. Molar proportions of individual VFA were not affected by diet; interactions between week\nand diet, although statistically significant, did not seem to follow a biologically sound trend and thus are not discussed. Molar proportion of acetate decreased as calves aged, whereas proportions of propionate, butyrate, and valerate increased, similar to results obtained by others (Anderson et al., 1987; Beharka et al., 1998); however, butyrate proportion decreased at 12 wk of age in the Anderson et al. (1987) study. Interestingly, in our previous study (Suarez-Mena et al., 2015), molar proportions of acetate increased with age whereas propionate and butyrate decreased; these conflicting results may be related to differences on diets composition and rumen pH. Isoacids molar proportion was low and decreased with calf age, as previously reported (Anderson et al., 1987; Beharka et al., 1998; Suarez-Mena et al., 2015). Rumen NH3 was not different between dietary treatments and decreased as calves aged; a decrease with age is consistent with the literature and is likely a result of increased use by rumen microbial population (Anderson et al., 1987; Beharka et al., 1998; Suarez-Mena et al., 2015).",

Total and retained Xgm of feces were not affected by diet, but the proportion of retained particles on the 3.35-mm sieve linearly increased (P\n = 0.03) as particle size did, which was compensated by a linear decrease (P\n = 0.01) in the proportion of particles retained in the 1.18-mm sieve as particle size increased. Similar fecal Xgm across diets implied that calves were able to reduce particle size of straw to the same size across diets, and this was possibly a consequence of increased ruminating activity as particle size increased. Hodgson (1971) observed calves spent longer times ruminating with greater diet particle size. In adult cattle, longer time spent ruminating increases saliva production and buffers rumen pH (Krause and Oetzel, 2006); however, we did not detect an effect of diet on rumen pH in the present study. Lack of differences in fecal particle size contrasts with shorter rumen contents particle size of PS and further supports the idea that calves had to spend more time or be more efficient at ruminating as particle size increased. Fecal pH was not statistically different between diets; however, the 2 diets with longest particle size had numerically higher (P\n = 0.13) pH than the other 2 diets. Castells et al. (2013) observed that calves supplemented with oat hay had lower rectum pH than calves fed concentrates only or supplemented with alfalfa hay (5.90, 6.40, and 6.48, respectively); these values are not far from those observed in the present study. Fecal starch concentration increased whereas pH decreased as calves aged (\nFigure 5), similar to our earlier study (Suarez-Mena et al., 2015); starch increase is likely a consequence of an increased passage rate due to higher intake. Other workers have also found a negative correlation between fecal pH and starch concentration in steers, lambs, older calves (Wheeler and Noller, 1977), and yearling heifers (Depenbusch et al., 2008). The decrease in fecal pH is responsive to greater amounts of starch being fermented in the hindgut (Depenbusch et al., 2008). The proportion of feces\u2019 soluble fraction decreased with age (84.7, 79.0, 72.7, 67.8, 64.2, and 59.9% for wk 1 to 6 from the time starter was available, respectively) likely a result of less DM coming from MR as starter intake increased. The lack of an age response in retained Xgm, in spite of greater proportions of fecal DM being retained, suggests that calves were able to reduce particle size of starter to the same degree as starter intake increased.",

This observation was attributed to an increased flow of particles with shorter particle size from rumen to omasum (Beharka et al., 1998) and to greater muscular development (Greenwood et al., 1997). Stevens et al. (1960) described the omasum as a 2-stage pump that transfers digesta from the reticulum to the abomasum. In the first stage, the omasal canal vacuums reticulum contents into the canal and pumps them into the omasal body; these 2 contractions are synchronized to primary and secondary rumen contractions. In the second stage, the omasal body contracts, pumping digesta into the abomasum or back to the reticulum; omasal body contractions do not necessary occur in synchrony with reticulo-omasal cycles and seem to be initiated by digesta accumulation between omasal leaves (Stevens et al., 1960). We hypothesized that small feed particles accumulate between omasal leaves when the particle size of the diet does not provide enough abrasion. Accumulation of particles increases omasum size by distending the omasal body and by greater muscle growth in response to increased omasal body contractions. We observed fully distended omasums with a hard to remove, paste-like matter between omasal leaves in several calves.",

            "text": "Rumen development measures of papillae length and width and rumen wall thickness were not affected by particle size. Beharka et al. (1998) reported greater length in the dorsal and blind sacs with greater diet particle size, whereas Greenwood et al. (1997) observed a decrease papillae length in the ventral floor of the cranial sac as particle size increased. Conflicting results between these studies could be related to sampling location. In the present study, papillae were measured from 9 locations, including all sacs, and the interaction between diet and location was not significant (P\n > 0.1). Fokkink et al. (2011) observed longer papillae when a starter greater in particle size was fed and calves had similar straw intakes; however, nutrient composition differed between starters. Castells et al. (2013) observed that calves supplemented with oat hay had shorter papillae than calves fed concentrates only when keratin layer was similar, yet calves had access to eat bedding. Calves in the Beharka et al. (1998) study were kept on diets for about 11 wk and fed milk\nto 8% of BW; hence, calves\u2019 solid feed intake was likely very high, which would intensify the effects of starter particle size. Also, the diet shorter in particle size had 20.5% of particles >0.99 mm, much less than the recommended 50% of particles >1.19 mm to ensure adequate intake, proper rumen fermentation (Warner et al., 1973), and prevent physiological abnormalities (Porter et al., 2007) up to 8 wk of age for calves fed no hay and without access to consuming bedding materials. In the Greenwood et al. (1997) study, the shorter particle size starter had 15.9% of particles >1.7 mm and 50.8% >0.85 mm, which likely did not meet Warner et al. (1973) recommendations either. Nevertheless, Warner et al. (1973) did not measure the keratin layer in their study for making suggestions. It is clear from these findings that calves do need a certain amount of large particles for healthy rumen development and papillae growth, yet this requirement is dependent on several factors, including diet ingredient composition and solid feed intake. It is possible that, in the present study, even when particle size of PS diet did not meet Warner et al. (1973) parameters and calves were on experimental diets for the same length of time and had comparable intakes to Greenwood et al. (1997) study, that PS particle size met the abrasiveness requirement for healthy papillae growth and thus increasing straw particle size had no effect on papillae length and rumen development parameters.",
