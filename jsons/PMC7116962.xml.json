            "text": "The Dioctophyma renale (Goeze, 1782) is a worldwide occurring nematode, known as giant kidney worm. It is the largest parasite nematode infecting domestic animals. Parasitism by this nematode has been described in different animal species, including in humans. Among the domestic species, it affects especially dogs, but it has been also observed in felines, swine, horses and cattle (Beaver and Theis, 1979, Kommers et al., 1999, Urquhart et al., 1998, Verocai et al., 2009). In Brazilian wild animals the parasitism was observed in coati (Nasua nasua), little grison (Galictis cuja), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), bush dog (Speothos venaticus) and two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) (Ribeiro et al., 2009). Vermins are ovipare and the female can reach more than 60 cm length and 1 cm diameter. The prepatent period for Dioctophyma is approximately 155 days and the entire life cycle can take up to two years to complete (Dyer, 1998, Measures and Anderson, 1985, Senior, 1980). Transmission of this parasite involves eggs being passed in the urine of the infected definite host. Eggs develop in the aquatic environment and are then ingested by the intermediate host, an aquatic oligochaete annelids (mud-worm), where the development of the first and second stages larva occurs. From this stage on, more than one route of transmission has been reported. In the first of them, maturation to third and fourth stages larva may occur within the annelid, which is then directly infective to mammal hosts; in the second route, an annelid containing a second stage larva may be ingested by a fish, or a frog, where the larva encysts in tissue and develops into third and fourth stages. In the third route, the infected annelid parasitic on crayfish (Cambarus spp.) may be ingested together with the crayfish by fish or frogs. As a result of these possible modes of transmission, some investigators consider fish or frogs as transporters rather than true intermediate hosts (Dyer, 1998). All routes of transmission converge on the mammal host. In the definitive hosts, the dioctophymas larva penetrates the duodenal wall, enters the abdominal cavity and migrates to the kidney, where it remains until the adult stage (Bowman, 1999, Dyer, 1998, Measures and Anderson, 1985, Pedrassani et al., 2009).",

In dogs, the nematode has been more frequently observed in the kidney or free in the abdominal cavity (Georgi and Georgi, 1991, Nakagawa et al., 2007). Usually, just one of the kidneys is affected, the right kidney more often than the left one, due to its anatomic proximity to the duodenum. Affected animals may demonstrate compressive atrophy of the renal parenchyma, dilation of the renal pelvis and ureteral obstruction, but the main lesion is the progressive destruction of the renal parenchyma leaving only a thin capsule containing the worm and hemorrhagic exudates inside (Nakagawa et al., 2007, Soler et al., 2008, Urquhart et al., 1998).",

The hemogram evinced neutrophilia with left shift, toxic granulation in neutrophils and lymphopenia, suggesting aggressive inflammatory lesion, probably due to destruction of the renal parenchyma by parasites. Parasitism with tissue invasion often induces to eosinophilia and/or basophilia (Latimer et al., 2003, Schultze, 2000, Thrall, 2007), as we can observe here.",

However, it is important to remark, that the eggs will only appear in the urine sediment, if a gravid parasite female is in the kidney causing the infection (Soler et al., 2008). This patient was submitted to nephrectomy and 3 parasites were found inside the right kidney. The dog's clinical signs were associated to the parasitic infection, since the patient's recovery was excellent with significant improvement of the clinical condition after removal of the affected kidney. For the same reason, additional blood tests were not performed. The animal was released after removing the cutaneous surgical wound stitches. In this case, the prognosis was favorable, due to the unilateral parasite localization. Sometimes, the D. renale finds itself free in the abdominal cavity causing a process of peritonitis, or even parasiting both kidneys of one animal. In such cases it is necessary to perform an exploratory laparotomy or nephrotomy to remove the parasites (Birchard and Sherding, 1994).",
