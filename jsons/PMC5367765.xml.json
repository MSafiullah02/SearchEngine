The soluble GP (sGP) is synthesized from the unedited RNA transcript. On the contrary, small soluble GP (ssGP) is translated during this process by adding two additional adenosine residues.10 The GPs are expressed virally on the virion surface, which plays a crucial role in the catalysis of membrane fusion and amalgamation to host cells. As a result, it is considered not only a crucial component for vaccines but also an essential target for developing inhibitors and antibodies of attachment and fusion.11\u201313",

The Chimera40 program was used to visualize the interactions of docked HLA-A\u2013epitope complexes, as shown in Figures 4 and S2. Then, binding energy calculation was carried out to understand the binding of HLA with epitopes. Here the binding free energies of MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA are approximate free energies of binding, so a more negative value denotes stronger binding. From MM-GBSA analysis, the highest binding free energy was observed for HLA-A*32:15 with epitope (HKEGAFFLY) of \u201363.89 kj/mol (Table S1). On the contrary, the lowest binding free energy was obtained for ATEDPSSGY epitope, i.e. \u201344.86 kj/mol.

The stability of the HLA-epitope complex by means of RMSD was calculated and rendered in Figure 5A. From the results, it is revealed that the HLA molecule was stabilized after 5 ns simulation and tended to remain in plateau phase thereafter for rest of the period. The RMSD value of HLA was observed to grow up quickly from 0.48 \u00c5 to 2.214 \u00c5 and remained stable in the range from 2.0 \u00c5 to 3 \u00c5. In case of epitope, similar RMSD pattern was observed, where the order of magnitude was seen to fluctuate in some range. The average energy of the simulation was \u2013578125.270 kj/mol; the average Coulombic charge and van der Waals interactions was \u2013694749.662 kj/mol, 77122.511 kj/mol, respectively. We also calculated the contribution of each residue for both HLA and epitope in the simulation, in terms of RMSF and RMSD. As seen in Figure 6A, highest RMSD was observed for ARG residue at the position of 180 in HLA, while lowest RMSD observed for CYS100. However, this residue was also resulted highest RMSF value of 7.181 \u00c5, while the rests of the residues were in lowest fluctuation. In case of epitope, the histidine residue at the first position and the tyrosine residue in 9th position were seen to be very much flexible, as these residues were resulted with highest RMSD and RMSF (Figure 6B). In the meanwhile, we calculated the number of hydrogen bond formed between the epitope and HLA molecule during the simulation. The results represented in Figure 5B, showed that hydrogen bond at initial stage was 236, and the range decreased to 160. During the simulation, the number of hydrogen bond was at a range of 160\u2013210, which indicates the strong binding of epitope-HLA complex. Hence, all analyses lead to the conclusion that HKEGAFFLY is one of the most prominent T-cell epitopes for GP based designing of vaccine.",

The Kolaskar and Tongaonkar48 antigenicity prediction uses a semiempirical method to predict antigenicity on the basis of physico-chemical properties of the residues in a protein and their diversity in experimentally known epitopes, where values >1.00 were considered to denote a potential antigen. As summarized in Table 4 and Figure S3, 14 epitopes have been found to satisfy the threshold value, and also have the potentiality to express the B-cell response. Furthermore, the surface accessibility of the protein was also analyzed using the Emini surface accessibility prediction methods, since a potent B-cell epitope should be accessible through the surface.47 As shown in Figure S4 and Table 5, higher accessibility was found in regions 9\u201317 and 186\u2013223 amino acid residues. Figure S5 represents the \u03b2-turns region identified by Chou and Fasman \u03b2-turn methods.52 According to the result, the region from 200 to 220 (in the region of 200\u2013220 and 105\u2013150) is regarded as \u03b2-turns as well as hydrophilic in nature. These are two properties required to be a potent B-cell epitope.60 Experimentally, antigenicity is related to the protein flexibility.61 That is why we implemented the Karplus and Schulz flexibility prediction method, where it was evident that the regions of 255\u2013280 and 200\u2013220 were regarded as the most flexible (Figure S6). Finally, based on the Hidden Markov model, the Bepipred linear epitope prediction tool was utilized to predict linear B-cell epitopes. The predicted result is rendered and tabulated in Figure S7 and Table 6. Hence, by comparing the foregoing results, the peptide sequences ranging from 186 to 220 are able to provoke the immune response as B-cell epitope for GP-based designing of vaccine.",

            "text": "We also validated each epitope by molecular docking simulation and MM-GBSA/MM-PBSA studies with HLA-A*32:15 protein, as it was found common in the results from MHC-I binding interaction analysis. Prior of docking simulation, the three dimensional structure of HLA molecule was prepared by using the Phyre2, followed by intensive mood. As a result, 179 residues (99%) of HLA-A*32:15 modelled at >90% accuracy. In these study, 2BCK_Chain A, crystal structure of HLA-A*2402 showed the highest similarity of 90% (Figure S1). The selected model has been chosen from the twenty models generated by Phyre2, on the basis of similarity and confidence level. Phyre2 is one of the best protein prediction servers that allows remote fold reorganization and homology detection. Using hidden Markov model (HMM), this server predicts the structure of given protein sequence by constructing backbone, loop modelling and adding side chains.75 However in intensive mode, additional ab initio approach is used for reconstruction of missing region, backbone and side chain.75 In docking simulation, among the other epitopes, HKEGAFFLY obtained highest binding affinity (Table S1, supplementary material). In addition, MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA techniques are frequently to re-rank docking poses from molecular docking study, as they achieve a much better performance than docking scoring functions.76 Nevertheless, the success rate of the absolute binding free energy prediction strongly depends on the systems.77 Thence, we used both of these solvation models to predict binding energy more accurately, where the results from MM-PBSA examine the accuracy and reliability of the results from MM-GBSA. Results of binding energy calculation are shown in Table S1. The relative magnitude of binding free energy obtained from GB methods is found to be consistent with those calculated using PB method, despite of the differences in the absolute value of salvation energy. As a corollary, these results also demonstrated the consistence with relative stabilities of HLA-epitope complexes. In previous published reports regarding in silico epitope identification of EBOV,78\u201381 the studies are limited to sequence-based scoring function techniques and some extend to docking simulation. These techniques have certain limitations, though these are very useful.82 In docking simulation of peptide and protein, it faces problem like peptide\u2019s flexibility.83,84 Whereas, energy based approach like molecular mechanics and interaction energy scoring can add valuable information to sequence based results.85,86",

In molecular dynamics simulation, both epitope and HLA protein were seen to achieve equilibration, while different fluctuations of RMSD were seen by the time evolution. Higher RMSD values of epitope indicate the flexibility in binding with HLA molecule, during the simulation. These results were further confirmed by the analysis of per residue contributions in dynamics simulation by means of RMSF and RMSD. Low values of RMSF indicate the core region of the HLA protein was stable, while high values of RMSD demonstrated the motion of the protein during the simulation. In like manner, the RMSD and RMSF profiles of eptiope confirm the synergic conformation changes to accommodate the binding pocket of HLA. The hydrogen bond occupancy analysis between the HLA-epitope further confirmed the stability of the complex during the simulation. Overall, these results evidently demonstrate that both HLA and epitope have remarkable conformation changes to facilitate the binding and formed stable complex in thermodynamic environment (Figure 7).",
