Immunosuppressed hosts have lower rates of seroconversion after infections, and this fact likely contributed to the low prevalence of positive cocci serologies in this population. Therefore, multiple modalities might be necessary to diagnose coccidioidomycosis in SCT recipients, in similarity with Aspergillus infection.Although EBV was the most common virus detected in BAL, the clinical significance of a positive BAL EBV PCR is not known and does not offer any meaningful clinical information in SCT recipients. We have since eliminated BAL EBV PCR from our BAL ICH bundled order sets. Thus, we considered parainfluenza as the most common \"real\" viral pathogen isolated in our cohort. Notably, we observed that 11of 12 BAL parainfluenza isolated between May 2012 and May 2013 were during a local parainfluenza outbreak. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FARP; BioFire Diagnostics, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT USA), which assesses the presence of 17 respiratory viruses and 3 atypical bacterial pathogens via PCR, was introduced at our institution at the end of our study period and was not part of our data collection. We are therefore unable to comment on whether a NP FARP or a BAL FARP would have provided additional information in our cohort. Azadeh et al. 21 compared the yield of concurrent NP vs BAL FARP at our institution and concluded that if a pathogen is identified by NP FARP, a BAL FARP is unlikely to add new microbiological information. Conversely, a BAL FARP may identify causative respiratory pathogens if performed within 7 days of a negative NP swab. Going forward, it would be interesting to study the utility of NP vs BAL FARP in our SCT population.Thirty-three patients underwent multiple BALs. Although the sample size was small, we observed that repeating a BAL within 30 days provided no additional microbiologic information but, rather, revealed the persistence of the original pathogen despite appropriate therapy.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICTS OF INTEREST"}]}
