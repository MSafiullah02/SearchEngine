The remdesivir core contains GS-441524, which interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases alone. In non-human primates, following IV administration, remdesivir is rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2 h to the active nucleoside triphosphate form, while GS-441524 is detectable in plasma for up to 24 h. Nevertheless, remdesivir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans are still unexplored, highlighting the need for a precise analytical method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification.",

Remdesivir is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenine nucleotide analogue. Its core is a 1 0 -cyano-substituted adenine C-nucleoside ribose analogue (GS-441524) linked to another small molecule through an ester bond; this linkage confers better penetration into cells. 1, 2 From 2015, remdesivir was tested in healthy volunteers during Phase I clinical trials and it then entered Phase II studies in the context of Ebola virus disease. 3, 4 It soon revealed activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses (CoVs). 5, 6 CoVs are positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animal hosts. In humans they are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. 6 Due to the effectiveness of GS-441524 in interfering with the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and inhibiting viral RNA synthesis, remdesivir is being developed for V C The Author(s) 2020.

[7] [8] [9] Concerning its metabolism, Warren et al. 1 demonstrated that, upon IV administration of a 10 mg/kg dose in rhesus monkeys, remdesivir exhibited a short plasma half-life (t1 =2 = 0.39 h) with rapid systemic elimination followed by the appearance of transient systemic levels of a key intracellular intermediate alanine metabolite and more persistent levels of GS-441524 (detectable for over 24 h in plasma). Thereafter, remdesivir was rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2 h into the active nucleoside triphosphate form. 1 However, information about remdesivir pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics in humans is inadequate and no therapeutic or toxic ranges have been reported; this is partially due to the small number of patients treated with remdesivir. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), consisting of the measurement of drug concentrations in biological fluids in order to optimize drug posology and avoid toxic effects or therapeutic failures, is already well established in several areas, such as in HIV treatment, and may be useful in the context of COVID-19 therapy. 10-12 Therefore, both for PK studies and for possible future TDM, there is the emerging need for a reliable analytical method for the quantification of remdesivir and its metabolite GS-441524 in human plasma. Here we present the first UHPLC method coupled with tandem MS (UHPLC-MS/MS), validated according to FDA and EMA guidelines, for both remdesivir and GS-441524 determination. ",

This phenomenon may explain the relatively low REC and EE (around 70%); in pre-spiked samples, remdesivir is possibly degraded by plasma esterases, as already demonstrated for artesunate in the context of malaria, whereas this reaction does not occur in post-spiked samples, where the plasma does not contain the proteins anymore, and degradation does not occur in chemical mixtures spiked with the drug. 25 Another confirmation of this phenomenon comes from the observation that after thermal inactivation QCs are more stable if kept at RT for 24 h, probably because plasma residual esterases lose their original conformation when excessively stressed by heat. These findings have implications for sample collection, transportation, storage and biosafety when processing for TDM or PK evaluation of remdesivir in tropical countries, where ambient temperatures may be high and access to a cold chain for sample transportation and storage may be limited. In this study, we observed that if samples undergo thermal inactivation immediately after withdrawal and they are then stored in a freezer (#20 C might be cold enough), a large proportion of degradation can be avoided.",

Consequently, the development of a parallel method for the intracellular quantification of remdesivir and of the triphosphate active form in the near future is guaranteed, following an already tested protocol. [26] [27] [28] Conclusions Although this method was not applied to real-life samples (due to a couple of factors: remdesivir is in Phase II evaluation and the number of treated patients is still low, to date, in Italy), it represents the first step in order to ensure a useful tool for the study of remdesivir PK.",
