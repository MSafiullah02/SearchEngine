Concentrations of the norovirus\nin wastewater samples collected every week accurately reflect the infection in the\nwatershed, suggesting that this approach can serve as a warning of a public\noutbreak.2 We suggest additional advantages to this\napproach and call for a wastewater collection campaign involving international\ncooperation between environmental researchers, wastewater workers, and public\nhealth specialists, aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19.",

First, virus concentrations in wastewater represent the overall status of\nthe watershed, while the number of COVID-19 cases involving infected people is\npossibly biased. Testing of the public seldom involves complete enumeration or\neven randomized sampling, because these sampling methods tend to overwhelm or\ncollapse the medical care system, have the disadvantage of false-positives, and\nare time and labor intensive. The WBE approach is effective in identifying\ntemporal changes in the infection status in the watershed without selection bias.\nIts second advantage relates to the issue of the stigma that can result from a\nCOVID-19 outbreak. Infected people, or those diagnosed with a false-positive,\ntogether with their families, are potentially harmed by stigma and discrimination\nas well as social isolation.3 This is one of the disadvantages\nof testing in complete enumeration or randomized sampling of the entire\npopulation. So far, WBE may not have been preferred due to potential regional\nstigma; however, WBE has proved its value by avoiding individual stigmatization.\nBy contrast, in the current context of a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, details\nof the number of cases in a particular region, and sometimes identifying details\nof infected individuals, are already being broadcast.",
