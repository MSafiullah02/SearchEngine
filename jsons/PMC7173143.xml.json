They form a prosthetic group of many enzymes that play a significant role in living organisms. They are present in vitamins, such as pyridoxine and niacin, as well as in natural alkaloid nicotine. Simple pyridine derivatives appear as metabolites from bacteria and fungi [1]. Nikkomycins [2], piericidins [3], collismycins [4] belong to this class of compounds. New bioactive bacteria metabolites and new natural vitamin B6 analogues were obtained from terrestrial Streptomyces sp. and characterized [5]. Due their biological activity, they form basic units in thousands of drugs, pharmaceuticals, antibiotics, insecticides and medically significant substances. Pyridine derivatives also possess anti-inflammatory [6,7], antiviral [8,9], anticancer [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]], antimicrobial activity [15,16], antidiabetic [17,18], osteogenic [19,20], antihypertensive [21] and perfumery applications [22].",

Herein, we present the X-ray single crystal structure of 2-N-methylamino-3-methylpyridine N-oxide (MA3MPO) and the results of IR, Raman, UV\u2013Vis and luminescence spectra, complemented by an analysis on the basis of the DFT and NBO quantum chemical calculations. Application of the density functional theory for assignment of the IR and Raman bands to the respective normal modes of vibrations is particularly valuable and credible when the input data for these calculations use the structural parameters derived from the XRD studies, as this was done in this work. This allowed for evaluation of vibrational and electron energy levels of the studied compound, their assignment to respective transitions between them, electron density of the atoms characterized by Mulliken population parameters derived from MPA analysis and non-bonding orbitals (NBO). Quantum chemical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03W program and the B3LYP method broadly applied in chemistry. As in our earlier papers, the B3LYP/6-311++G (d,p) approach, that allows for comparison of the former [[36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]] and present results, was used.",

The last step of this synthesis was nucleophilic substitution of the chlorine atom in the 2 position by the methylamine group. 2-Chloro-4-nitropicoline N-oxide reacts with the primary amines under reflux in methanol solution to give the 2-N-alkylaminopyridine derivatives. Lack of nitro substituent in the 4-position of the 2-chloro-3-methylpyridine N-oxide causes that substitution of chlorine with methylamine in the methyl solution does not take place. The use of an aqueous solution of methylamine and heating the reaction mixture to 120 \u00b0C gives the expected product.",

The CRYSALIS program system was used for data collection, cell refinement and data reduction [44]. The structure was solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program [45], and refined on F\n2 by full-matrix least squares with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-H-atoms using SHELXL-97 [46]. All H-atoms were initially located in difference Fourier maps, and in the final refinement cycles were treated as described below. All C-bound H atoms were placed in the calculated positions, with C\u2013H = 0.95\u20130.98 \u00c5, and refined with the riding model with U\niso(H) = 1.2U\neq(C) for CH or 1.5Ueq(C) for CH3. The N-bonded H atom was refined freely, with U\niso(H) = 1.2U\neq(N). The figures were made using the DIAMOND program [47].

Its molecular structure and atomic description is presented in Fig. 2\n. Due to weak intermolecular interactions between the components of the unit cell, and the lack of factor group splitting in the experimental spectra, the calculations were performed for the monomeric molecule. The scaling factors were used to correct the evaluated wavenumbers for vibrational anharmonicity and deficiencies inherent to the used computational level. In the Potential Energy Distribution (PED) procedure the BALGA program was used [55]. The ChemCraft program was used for visualisation of the vectoring graphics of the normal modes [56].

Conformation of the MA3MPO molecule is stabilized by the intramolecular N\u2013H\u22efO [2.5266 (14) \u00c5] hydrogen bond, between the hydrogen atom of the amine group and the oxygen atom of the NO group.

Three of them refer to stretching vibrations and three correspond to the bending motions. However, due to the formation of the cyclic unit from the N-oxide and N\u2013H groups, the number of modes in which the N\u2013H bond is involved is significantly higher. The following, normal modes of this type have been recognized in the DFT calculations: \u03bd(N-HHB) at 3271 cm-1; \u03c1(NH) and \u03c1(NH)+\u03bd(\u03d5) at 1478-1580 cm-1; \u03b4(\u03d5)+\u03c9(NH) at 764-827 cm-1 and \u03c4(NHC) at 240-250 and 120-125 cm-1. These vibrations appear at a somewhat lower wavenumbers than those originating from the NH bond not engaged in the hydrogen bonds. The shift of the NHHB vibrational band depends on the HB bond strength and on the N\u2013H\u22efO angle. The smaller distance between the hydrogen donor and acceptor and the closer to 180\u00b0, the stronger bond and the greater band shift to the lower wavelengths [63,64].",

Therefore, they are involved in several vibrations observed in the whole MIR region. The following normal modes contain contribution of these motions: \u03bd(NO) 1212-1324 cm-1, \u03b4(C\u03d5-N-O): 627-628 cm-1 and \u03b3(NO): 395-571 and 171-227 cm-1 [41,42]. Such broad wavenumber range of these vibrations also follows the engagement of the oxygen atom of this group in the hydrogen bond. In derivatives containing a planar nitro group at the 4-position, the N\u2013O bond of 1.301\u20131.305 and 1.315 \u00c5 length, mainly due to the return donation of the NO and NO2 substituents, has the double-bond character. In the molecule analyzed, the bond length of 1.334 \u00c5 indicates that the N\u2013O bond is an almost single bond, and therefore its stretching vibration band should appear at lower wavenumbers. The second reason for the N\u2013O bond elongation is the intramolecular interaction between the oxygen atom of the -NO and the hydrogen atom of the -NHCH3 groups located at vicinal positions of the pyridine ring. For the above reasons, one should expect a shifting of this band toward red.",

It was expected that these evaluations would allow for characterization of the role of the intramolecular hydrogen bond in stabilizing the structure and delocalization of electron density within the molecule. One of the methods for determination of energy and some properties of hydrogen bonds is the natural bonded orbitals method (NBO) [[65], [66], [67], [68]]. The existence of the intramolecular hydrogen bond in the MA3MPO molecule is confirmed by the NBO presented in Table 6\n. It follows from the parameters characterizing interaction between the oxygen lone pair of the N-oxide group and N\u2013H antibonding orbital of the amino group (LP (2) O2\u2192\u03c3*N2\u2013H2). Although the energetic contribution (6.55 kcal/mol) of hyperconjugative interactions is not significant, the E(2) value has chemical significance, and can be used as a measure of the intra-molecular electron delocalization in the molecule. The medium binding the strength of an intramolecular hydrogen bond is also confirmed by the high value of electron density (ED = 0.03610 e) on the \u03c3*N\u2013H orbital (Table 6). While analysing the energies that follow from the second-order perturbation theory of Fock matrix strong intra-molecular hyperconjugative interactions are seen.

            "text": "The electron absorption spectrum of the studied compound was recorded at room temperature in the solid state (Nujol mull). The spectrum is shown in Fig. 7. The contour observed within the range of 200\u2013400 nm has been deconvoluted into nine Gaussian components with the maxima at 215, 238, 248, 261, 283, 318, 349, 364, 389 nm. The assignment of these wavelengths to the respective electron transitions was made on the basis of time depended TD-DFT method. The results of these evaluations are listed in Table 7\nin which the energies of ten singlet and triplet states, oscillator strength and main contributions are summarized. The singlet states were localized at the following wavenumbers: S1 32363; S2 35840 S3 36232; S4 38168; S5 40161; S6 41494; S7 42735; S8 43290; S9 43860 and S10 44643 cm-1 and those of triplet states: at T1 20161; T2 28409 and T3 29762 cm-1. The respective electron transitions should be assigned to the following wavelength ranges: \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 at 190\u2013220 nm; n(O) \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 at 230\u2013255 nm; n(Npyridine) \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 at 280\u2013300 nm and n(Namine) \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 at 320\u2013420 nm. The calculated energies of electron transitions are in good agreement with those reported in our earlier papers on other pyridine derivatives [42,[69], [70], [71], [72]].",

            "text": "The emission spectrum of the studied compound was measured in the solid state. It contains a very broad contour with the maximum at about 580 nm (Fig. 8\n). It is clearly shifted into red in relation to the S0 \u2192 S1 absorption transition. The observed contour probably originates from T1,T2 \u2192 S0 emission that may proceed by the inter-system crossing S1 \u2192 T1,T2 transition. Room temperature fluorescence is generally not observed from excited triplet states, however, having in mind the calculated energies of the Molecular Orbitals, we believe that such character of this transition is reasonable. According to the DFT calculations, the energies of the T1 and T2 states are 20161 cm-1 and 28409 cm-1, respectively, i.e. are close to those expected for the emission from the triplet state. The small energetic splitting between these levels probably causes overlapping of these bands in the form of broad T1-T2 contour. Besides, their red shift agrees with the expectations because both intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds significantly affects the excited state properties. The excited-state hydrogen bonding influences nonadiabatic processes like internal conversion, intersystem crossing, intramolecular charge transfer and photoinduced electron transfer [[73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]]. It should be noted that the Stokes shift for the studied sample is close to 8.250 cm-1. Fig. 9\nrepresents the system of ten singlet and three triplet states of MA3MPO.",

            "text": "\n1.2-N-methylamino-3-methylpyridine N-oxide (MA3MPO) is a new compound for which we expect several prospective applications. It crystallizes in monoclinic P21/n structure, and conformation of the MA3MPO molecule is stabilized by the intra-molecular N\u2013H\u22efO (2.527 \u00c5 and 120\u00b0) hydrogen bond, between the hydrogen atom of the amine group and the oxygen atom of the N-oxide group. The respective geometrical parameters (2.539 \u00c5 and 118\u00b0) obtained in the DFT quantum chemical calculations are close to experimental values.2.The experimental N\u2013O bond length (1.334 \u00c5) is slightly longer than the calculated distance (1.298 \u00c5) as well as those reported earlier for 2-alkylaminopyridine N-oxides (1.301\u20131.318 \u00c5). This effect follows from the participation of this bond in the HB interactions. The X-ray studies also postulate the existence of weak C\u2013H\u22efO contacts between the N-oxide as acceptors and the H atoms of the pyridine and the methyl groups as donors. However, the IR and Raman spectra as well as the quantum chemical calculations do not confirm the presence of such interactions.3.The quantum-chemical calculations conducted for isolated MA3MPO molecules locate the lowest singlet state assigned to the n \u2192 \u03c0* (CT) transitions overlapped with some contribution of the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The energy gap between these electron levels forms a specific sequence that may be applied for the ligand to lanthanide ion energy transfer. The depopulation mechanism of the excited states for the studied pyridine N-oxide is proposed.4.The N-oxide group substituted to the pyridine ring can act effectively as an electron donor and an electron acceptor at the same time. For these reasons, the studied compound appears as a synthetic intermediate in the field of heterocyclic chemistry, protecting group, auxiliary agent, catalysts, and as complexing ligands for d- and f-metal ions. In particular, the MA3MPO could be used as a complexing ligand of europium and terbium ions in the luminescent probes of biological and medical applications.\n",
