The process takes an anthropological approach to explore the meanings of risk and the elements that steer the assessment of a risk situation. It uses a conceptual framework of subjective perception of risk, reflecting individual, societal and cultural contexts [1]. It also includes exploring the perceived trust [2] towards those who are communicating about COVID-19 in Finland.",

Thematic analysis is carried out weekly to systematise and recognise emerging themes by organising the narrative data according to the risk model, identifying codes and categories within each domain, followed by developing concepts based on data interpretation [3]. The concepts are developed into operational recommendations through the methodology of knowledge co-production. This methodology uses the knowledge of different disciplines to ensure that findings and resulting recommendations are seen as relevant [4], following best practices for public health and risk communication [5]. The process requires expertise in qualitative analysis and a robust system for retrieving social media data from various sources. Qualitative software can facilitate organising the data.",
