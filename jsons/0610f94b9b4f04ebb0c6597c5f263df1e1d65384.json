Since \"payoff\" (the term in Fig. S4(a) ) is the defined as the opposite number of \"risk level\" (the term in Fig. S4(b) ), some model parameters have symmetric PRCC result with respect to level \"0\" (see the vertical grey dashed line in Fig. S4 ) on both panels.

Hence, these parameters should be the focus of data collection efforts during outbreaks when a travel policy must be decided.

Therefore, we have \u03c1 = p * (where p * is individual's optimal travelling probability) under normal scenario (i.e., no serious disease outbreak, of which no restriction on travelling entry). However, during a serious disease outbreak, the local government will consider restricting travelling entry (in order to lower the number of visitors inside border) according to population's optimal travelling proportion (i.e., \u03c1 * ), and this would change \u03c1 = min{p * , \u03c1 * }. Numerical examples of local governmental intervention on travelling entry (i.e., \u03c1) are discussed in section S4.

Note that a \"potential visitor\" can only become a \"visitor outside\" if he has finished his final travelling decision (see S1). The knowledge of the range of \u03bb \u22121 can be learnt by referring to the \"deadline\" of withdrawal of various travelling \"services\" (e.g., hotel, flight, etc., see S6.1). Therefore, the speed of health information spread could be related to \u03bb \u22121 because that the updating of relevant information can \"renew\" individual's final decision (i.e., re-choose strategy). Therefore, higher speed of information spread is corresponding to lower value of \u03bb \u22121 . Table 1 . Fig. S5 shows the relations among relative risk (r), rate of visitors pass border (\u03bb) and \u2206\u03c1 during an epidemic. When \u03bb increases, the discrepancy (\u2206\u03c1) of individual (p * ) and group optimum (\u03c1 * ) appears under a wider range of relative risk (r). The discrepancy (\u2206\u03c1) shifts leftwards (the direction r increases) as R 0 increasing.
