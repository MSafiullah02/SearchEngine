With a death rate that is climbing rapidly, the disease has been declared a global emergency.2 A substantial number of healthcare workers tested positive for the disease in Italy, the epicentre of the European outbreak, particularly in its early stages. The number of positive healthcare workers was 10,627 with 34 deaths to date, representing a mortality rate of 0.3%,3 but the Italian authorities acknowledged that healthcare workers were over tested which may account for a lower mortality rate. The most worrying statistic is the rising number of deaths amongst healthcare professionals.4 There have already been seven healthcare staff deaths in the UK5 as of 5 April 2020. This has been postulated to be for a number of reasons and may be multifactorial.",

Public health England (PHE) have recommended that an FFP3 mask (Fig. 1\n) should be used if available but an FFP2/N95 mask can be used when FFP3 are not available for AGP.15 Otherwise there is very little divergence between the two guidance articles.",
