As of March 3, 2020, more than 90000 people have been confirmed to have COVID-19 and more than 3000 people have died from the disease worldwide. Without any suitable therapeutic drugs, early detection and timely isolation are the best methods of preventing the disease from progressing and spreading. The role of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) has been crucial in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and typical radiologic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the diagnostic criteria in China (2). Moreover, initial chest CT had a higher sensitivity than reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 2019-nCoV (3). The typical CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia include bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities and consolidative lesions in peripheral lung fields (45). However, we treated three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia initially manifesting as a solitary sub-centimeter nodule on baseline CT imaging in hospital. The purpose of the study is to share our experience of atypical manifestations of COVID-19 on CT with the aim of achieving a comprehensive radiological understanding of COVID-19.",

Initial laboratory investigation revealed the following: decreased leukocyte count (3.74 \u00d7 109/L), normal neutrophil ratio (46.2%), and increased monocyte ratio (21.9%). Chest CT images showed a small solitary ground-glass nodule on January 24 (Fig. 1A). Soon the patient's sputum tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. On January 29, the nodule had enlarged with ground-glass opacities on follow-up CT images (Fig. 1B). The initial nodules showed absorption changes and the typical radiological manifestation of COVID-19 infection began to appear in the whole lung on February 1 (Fig. 1C). With the progression of infection, the patient showed abnormal results in laboratory investigations on February 8; the neutrophil ratio was increased (77.8%), the lymphocyte ratio was decreased (12.4%), the monocytes ratio was decreased (9.8%), and the lymphocyte count was decreased (0.68 \u00d7 109/L). After antiviral and symptomatic treatment, most of the lesions had been absorbed and some residues still existed in the peripheral lung on the latest follow-up CT images (Fig. 1D). She has since been cured, testing negative for viral nucleic acid.",

Because of his history of exposure to a confirmed patient, he was asked to stay in isolation at home. However, on baseline chest CT images, a small ill-defined ground-glass nodule was suspected in his left lower lobe (Fig. 2A). On January 30, he began to have a fever (37.8\u2103) with chest pain and his C-reactive protein level was slightly increased (8.7 mg/L); therefore, he underwent a further chest CT scan. A confluent crazy-paving appearance presented in the same location as the nodule on chest CT images (Fig. 2B). Because of medical resource pressures from the COVID-19 outbreak, the patient was treated at home with antiviral agents. The latest follow-up chest CT images showed that the lesioned area had become smaller and the density had begun to decrease on February 13 (Fig. 2C). The patient remains under close observation although the clinical symptoms have disappeared.",

(6), the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was estimated to be 2.68 (95% confidence interval, 2.47\u20132.86), which means the 2019-nCoV has great transmission capacity. The aim of this study was to alert radiologists that some patients with COVID-19 infection could have only a sub-centimeter ground-glass nodule on baseline chest CT images. These patients will be prone to misdiagnosis in the clinic if the radiologists disregard the possibility of COVID-19 in the radiology report. In addition, we recorded the evolution of chest CT findings in COVID-19 pneumonia. RT-PCR analysis is the gold standard for diagnosing 2019-nCoV infection, but in the context of limited medical resources with an overwhelming outbreak, the role of chest CT is particularly important.",

The disease progressed over a period of 2\u20133 days, presenting as an enlarged nodule with a blurred margin on CT. Interestingly, the small ground-glass nodules were initially separate from the pleura; however, as the nodule evolved, the shape of the lesions became patchy to confluent and were predominantly found in subpleural areas. Multiple solid and ground-glass opacities always began to appear in the local lobe. Soon after, crazy-paving pattern, diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities with segmental consolidation appeared in the peripheral areas of the lung during the peak stage of the disease (approximately 10 days after onset of initial symptoms). The above imaging findings were associated with the death of a large number of epithelium and foam cells in the alveoli, inflammatory exudate filling the alveolar cavity, and pulmonary tissue necrosis (13).

            "text": "In summary, we suspect that a solitary sub-centimeter nodule reflects an incipient stage of COVID-19 when it just begins to involve the lower respiratory tract. More remarkably, chest CT images can depict minute incipient lesions before the onset of symptoms. The Fleischner guideline is a commonly used guideline when a small ground-glass nodule is incidentally encountered on CT. The guideline recommends no routine follow-up or 6\u201312 months follow-up based on whether the nodule was 6 mm in size (14). In the endemic areas of COVID-19, such follow-up strategies may miss incipient COVID-19 pneumonia. Accordingly, short-interval follow-up CT scan is required, particularly for suspected cases with a history of exposure to 2019-nCoV, considering its rapid progression. A few patients lack symptoms in the early stages of infection but also exhibit positive CT findings according to Ai et al. (3). Moreover, we revealed the evolution of disease as seen on chest CT and these findings are nearly consistent with a recent report (101115). Thus, chest CT is of great significance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in areas where COVID-19 infection prevails. Accurate diagnosis requires an in-depth understanding of COVID-19 with a combination of the patient's symptoms, epidemic history, and other medical examination findings at the same time.",
