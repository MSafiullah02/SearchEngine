The authors have provided well\u2010collected and analysed data obtained in difficult clinical circumstances on an infectious condition that is potentially lethal. The phenomenon described is robust and reminiscent of other postviral infection syndromes. However, some of the endocrine findings in this study are of uncertain value and some of the secondary conclusions conjectural. In this brief editorial, we will try to put the phenomenon described in this remarkable study into a more general perspective.",

In addition, one can hardly contest the concurrent mild hypocortisolism examined by the well\u2010accepted time\u2010integrated measure of 24\u2010h urinary free cortisol excretion.\n2\n Caution should, however, be exercised on conclusions based on HPA axis evaluation during the morbid state of SARS, and the validity of single, low\u2010dose ACTH stimulation tests is dubious as an unquestionable index of low or high HPA axis activity.\n2\n This is because the initial test was performed during a time of major physical and emotional stress, while subsequent short synacthen tests used a single submaximal dose of the peptide. The short, low\u2010dose synacthen test has considerable intraindividual variability, even when a stress\u2010producing condition is stable.\n3\n, \n4\n This assessment would have been more valid if a number of doses of synacthen were used to span the dose\u2013response curve.",

As a product of active systemic inflammation, sickness syndrome is accompanied by activation of the acute\u2010phase reaction and the pain and fatigue system, with which it represents an extremely important composite biological programme responsible for generating behaviours and somatic responses that protect us from tissue damage and allow time and energy for a speedy and efficient tissue repair.\n8\n An immune and inflammatory reaction of sufficient magnitude, however, through the proinflammatory cytokines, also activates the HPA axis, which to some extent serves as a valuable negative feedback system that prevents this reaction from overshooting.\n8\n\n",

Hence, when properly activated, this axis diminishes the manifestations of sickness syndrome and the activity of the pain and fatigue response.\n8\n Acute Addison's disease is associated with varying degrees of sickness syndrome manifestations because the intrinsic levels of cortisol are insufficient to counteract the proinflammatory molecules that generate the syndrome.\n8\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n These manifestations may vary from a very mild sickness syndrome all the way to circulatory collapse and death, when an immune and inflammatory reaction has become unconstrained and uncompensated.

What are the mechanisms that generate this post\u2010stress syndrome, and is it possible that some patients are more prone to develop it than others? In our opinion, this syndrome is produced by a period of prolonged central nervous system suppression of the HPA axis that results when a major stressor, in this case the virus, is of sufficient magnitude and duration that it causes sustained hypercortisolism. The degree and duration of this post\u2010stress neuroendocrine HPA axis alteration, the activity of the immune system that generates the sickness syndrome and the sensitivity of the pertinent target tissues to glucocorticoids and cytokines are defined by genetic and developmental/constitutional factors, which determine whether an individual is more prone or more resistant to developing the syndrome. It is quite likely that syndromes such as CFS, FM, and other chronic pain and fatigue states represent pathological conditions in which such an important adaptive biological programme has gone awry, has lost its adaptive value, and in fact prevents healthy functioning of the suffering individual.\n6\n\n",

It is obvious that patients with a truly subnormal standard, high\u2010dose ACTH test should be treated for adrenal insufficiency with glucocorticoids, as the current standards of care dictate.\n2\n However, in all others, who appear to be the majority of those with the syndrome, in the absence of data, a conservative approach should be taken. We do not treat patients with the euthyroid sick syndrome, which is an adaptive state that conserves energy in an individual that is under stress. On the same logical basis, we should probably not administer exogenous glucocorticoids for what is essentially an adaptive response of the HPA axis after major or prolonged stress. We recognize that there are no data to support this opinion at the present time and that properly designed, double\u2010masked and placebo\u2010controlled studies should be undertaken to test this hypothesis.",

Note the involvement of NF\u2010\u03baB, a major proinflammatory transcription factor in both CNS and peripheral inflammation. On the other hand, the activated HPA axis, through its end\u2010hormone, cortisol, and its receptor (GR), inhibits CNS and peripheral inflammation, as well as its own activity. (b) The presence of increased proinflammatory cytokines and other agents in the vicinity of peripheral somatic and autonomic afferent nerves decreases the pain and fatigue threshold of an individual and hence produces hyperalgesia and fatigue.
