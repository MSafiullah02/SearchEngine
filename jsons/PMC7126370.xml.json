When the virus enters the body, it infects various types of immune cells by initially targeting monocytes and macrophages, and cause the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [98]. In the previous studies it was shown that host Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a sensor for EBOV glycoprotein (GP) on virus-like particles (VLPs) and that resultant TLR4 signaling pathways lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in a human monocytic cell line and in HEK293-TLR4/MD2 cells stably expressing the TLR4/MD2 complex. EBOV GP interacts with TLR4, and on VLPs it was able to stimulate expression of NF-\u03baB in a TLR4-dependent manner. It was also found that budding of EBOV VLPs was more pronounced in TLR4-stimulated cells than in unstimulated control cells. These findings identify the host innate immune protein TLR4 as a sensor for Ebola virus GP and play an important role in the immune-pathogenesis.",

Ebola virus VP40 + GP VLPs, but not VP40 VLPs, induced cytokine and SOCS1 expression in a TLR4/MD2 dependent manner both in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells) and in 293T cells expressing a functional TLR4/MD2 receptor.

In addition, Ebola cases were also exported to several other African and European countries including United States, with further transmission to healthcare workers across several countries [13]. The large number of Ebola survivors has the frequency of persistent symptoms and the possibility of virus persistence in sanctuary sites, leading to delayed transmission. EBOV may also persist in immune-privileged sites and semen of survivors which lead to re-ignition of EVD outbreak. As EBOV RNA can remain detectable in immune-privileged tissues for prolonged periods of time after clearance from the blood, suggesting that it may persists during convalescence and thereafter [97]. Eliminating persistent EBOV is important to ensure full recovery of survivors and decrease the risk of outbreak re-ignition caused by EBOV spread from healthy survivors to new contact [20].",

It is suggested that humans are confronted by animal derived pathogens, however, only a small fraction of people (having weak immunity) get affected. Spill-over dynamics are liable to a range of local impact and practice, both social and environmental influences on viral pathogen dynamics in the manner that interaction with susceptible sympatric species [25].

Systematic Modeling and Interaction Modeling can be used extensively to model biological phenomenon.

We can even develop better vaccines and drugs for the diseases [27]. Infectious diseases are growing rapidly as the pathogens are evolving themselves against our therapeutics. There has been an urgent need for improved remedies against pathogens. Systems Biology based studies have proved to be icing on the cake! Systems Biology based analysis have been worked out recently in order to capture how the host genes are associated with the viral replication that tend to occupy space in the human protein interactome [28], [29]. A comprehensive systems-level analysis of the virus-host interactome is very important for understanding the roles of host factors with the end goal of discovering new druggable antiviral targets ([30]; Chasman, et al., 2014).",

Before testing any drug, patients need to be isolated and there should be no contact between the patients and the rest of the people, which can cause further contamination [98]. The blood samples are taken and rapidly sent to the pathological laboratories for testing. In the fresh phase of the disease, fluid replacement therapy hysterically escalates the probability of endurability. Ribavirin, the only acknowledged antiviral viz. competent against certain VHF pathogens such as Lassa fever, is not active against Ebola viruses, which is unfortunate as it has already passed the 3rd phase of clinical trials. ZMapp, on the other hand, is a combination of monoclonal antibodies used to treat Ebola patients. Its role in treating EVD is still not certified as enough data proving it to be efficient is yet not published. It works well when tested on non-primates as it was capable enough to revert back the EVD. Favipiravir is the most commonly used and tested drug on humans. When tested on mice, it prevented its death, but its activity in non-human models still need to be validated. BCX4430 is another drug extensively studied and worked on, and has proved to be effective against Marburg Viruses in non-human primate models and Ebola model of mice. Ebola outbreak of Kikwit in 1995 was treated with patients being treated to Convalescent Plasma treatment, which at that time proved to be better as fewer people died and many survived. These days, with latest techniques and technology, this treatment is not being used much [45].",

Despite, the results did not ascertain any cogent vaccine candidates even in commensuration of animal model [92]. Nevertheless, Ebola vaccine design and development studies have been going on for the last several decades, but unfortunately, the pace was not so rapid or rewarding. As a result, the development of vaccines related to EBOV has several limitations related to safety and personal expertise [36]. Some approaches were based on DNA, called DNA Vaccine, and were initiated during 2000s. Such approaches were tested and found to be successful. In DNA vaccine, infused nucleoprotein (NP) or glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV acts as an antigen to activate host immune responses and infused antigen-delivering DNA boosts the immunization [49]. Recently, a trial using Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) platform has been devised as bivalent vaccine against EBOV showing systemic immune responses safe-guarding animals after injection [50]. This non-segmented, negative stranded RNA virus is likewise celebrated to be a superlative competitor for recombinant DNA vaccine belvedere across several filoviruses as the virtue of the virus is an animal pathogen that does not coax any kind of serious manifestations in humans [50], [51].VSV based candidate vaccines (VSV-GP) have been successful in mice and have proved to give complete protection and also, have shown to be effective in the post exposure treatment regime. Since VSV-based vaccines are replication competent recombinant viruses, their use have been suspected in humans [88]. VSV based vaccines are an exclusive feature that is very precious in laboratory accidents, outbreak and bio-weapon exposure situations [52]. A review on phase-I trials of EBOV vaccines can be in found in Lambe et al. [53].",

Favipiravir performs antiviral activities against negative stranded RNA viruses, and has been administered in European Centres in the last EVD outbreak. Molecules such as Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers (PMOs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are found useful in abbreviating carnage when supervised to NHPs up to 1 h after disclosure [57], [58].

EBOV is an enveloped virus composed of 18.8\u201319 kb single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 proteins and has surface glycoprotein presenting roles in cell attachment, fusion and cell entry involved in immune evasion and pathogenesis of disease. Transmission of the virus is generally zoonosis which involves animals and humans. As it was identified that fruit bats are the reservoir hosts of the Ebola Virus and therefore they carried this virus and transmits to other animals and further to humans. The spill-over of infections basically occurs from bats to humans but the dynamical mechanism of EBOV is understood by 3 factors, namely, Biological Factors, Environmental Factors and Social Factors, and therefore, the infectious interaction between bats and the ecosystem is responsible for the spill-over dynamics of deadly diseases either directly (bats -> humans) or indirectly (bats -> animals -> humans). So, to understand the framework for the holistic study of disease dynamics mechanism of EBOV, various approaches such as Life Sciences, Mathematics, Systems Biology, Computational, and Analytical methods need to be applied.",

Phase II, III, and IV trials didn\u2019t give better results due to lack of equipment, resources and technology. Various small molecules and antiviral drugs, including as Favipiravir, siRNAs, PMOs, AVI6002, Brincidofovir, BCX4430, and ZMapp, have been developed. Among these, the most promising and active antiviral drugs are ZMapp and Favipiravir. Hence, to get a victory against Ebola, we still require powerful drugs and vaccines.

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention is engrossed broadly with allies to help stop the epidemic at its source in Africa. Thousands of people from affected areas travel to different part of the world. As long as Ebola is growing, practitioners are required to be very alert to the probability of EVD, check travel history, and immediately separate and test ill travelers who have travelled to EVD affected regions in the past 3 weeks [71]. However, it is a challenging task. Regardless of the fact, the service of anticoagulant therapy in humans needs additional studies distinctly in confining with clear-cut antiviral remedies. Though, the services of interferons as broad-spectrum antivirals archaize finite both by the brevity and fatality of their effects. This has jeopardized attention about the expectancies for a wide array of other newly characterized cytokines that also inspires innate immunity. To elevate the predictability, it becomes mandatory to identify infected persons as soon as possible, which requires latest diagnostic techniques and treatment facilities. A single nonchalant activity can be disastrous. By following precautionary measures, spread of the disease can be restricted to a large extent. Challenges in combating Ebola are not only limited to resources and knowledge, but also public and personal hygiene that must be adopted in the society.",
