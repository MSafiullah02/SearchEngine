Sepsis is a potentially fatal whole-body inflammation (a systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS) caused by severe infection (Bone et al. 1992; Levy et al. 2003). Sepsis develops when the initial host response to an infection is amplified and becomes damaging to the host (Weber and Swirski 2014). Some structural components of bacteria (pathogen-associated molecular patterns-PAMPs), are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed in phagocytes and other cell types (Hargreaves et al. 2005) and are responsible for the initiation of the septic process. The process can lead to activation of NF-\u03baB and transcription of several pro-inflammatory genes, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2.",

            "text": "Recent evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) is an important endogenous regulatory molecule, implicated in both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes in the lung (Sharma et al. 2007; Hamza et al. 2010; Hossain et al. 2012). Additionally, it is well known that administration of LPS increases the expression and activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which, consequently, increases nitric oxide (NO) generation (Parratt 1997). Cyclooxygenase (COX), the prostaglandin H synthase enzyme, is involved in a wide variety of inflammatory diseases, including lung injury (Fukunaga et al. 2005). COX-2 is an inducible enzyme catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 is a potent inflammatory mediator. The expression of COX-2, the inducible isoform of COX, increases markedly during inflammation (Zhang et al. 2011), mainly in response to various proinflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL) -1\u03b2, IL-6, and LPS (Serou et al. 1999; Huang et al. 2000). In LPS-induced ALI, endotoxin administration disrupts the alveolocapillary barrier because of the overproduction of NO and PGE2 through the induction of iNOS and COX-2, respectively (Mann et al. 2005; Grommes et al. 2011).",

NF-\u03baB is a dimer consisting of p65, a transcription-activating component, or p50. In resting cells, NF-\u03baB exists in an inactive state in the cytoplasm, coupled with an inhibitory protein called I\u03baB. Upon activation, I\u03baB undergoes phosphorylation and degradation, and NF-\u03baB is translocated into the nucleus where it binds to DNA and activates gene transcription (Kretz-Remy et al. 2001).",

In our study we determined the expression of certain AOEs and the production of ROS in sepsis mice in the different treatment groups. Sepsis induction treatment led to reduced AOE expression of catalase, MnSOD, CuZnSOD, and GPx-1 (Fig. 6a) and higher production of ROS (Fig. 6b) in lung tissues of sepsis mice when compared to the non-treated sham group.

Acacetin not only inhibited sepsis-induced decrease of HO-1 expression, but also increased the HO-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6c). Next, to confirm the anti-oxidative protective activity of acacetin on sepsis-induced ALI, we measured ROS production in alveolar macrophages under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 6d, LPS stimulation significantly increased ROS production in alveolar macrophages, however, acacetin treatment dramatically decreased LPS-induced ROS production in alveolar macrophages. Taken together, these results indicate that the antioxidative activity of acacetin could reduce sepsis-induced oxidative damage to lung tissue by increasing the expression of AOEs and HO-1.",

            "text": "The breakdown of the alveolar\u2013capillary barrier causes obstruction of the pulmonary gas exchange in ALI. Neutrophil activation, which increases sepsis-induced alveolar\u2013capillary barrier permeability and results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is one of the mechanisms underlying the barrier\u2019s breakdown. In addition, it has been proposed that sepsis can induce pulmonary ROS production, and that ROS could increase local inflammation and thereby contribute to pulmonary tissue damage (Geerts et al. 2001). Although a moderate amount of ROS is required for the innate immune system to kill pathogens, excessive amounts of ROS can cause harmful effects, including pulmonary tissue damage, apoptosis, and necrosis (Grommes et al. 2011). Therefore, the injection of SOD, a specific superoxide radical scavenger, could protect mice from virus infection- or sepsis-induced ALI (Maeda et al. 1991). Additionally,microvascular endothelial injury could lead to higher capillary permeability. The increased capillary permeability enhances the entrance of protein-rich fluid into the peribrochovascular intersititium, leading to lung edema (Johnson et al. 2010; Antoine Roch et al. 2011). We demonstrated that acacetin treatment significantly alleviated sepsis and the concomitant pathological changes in the sepsis-induced ALI mouse model (Fig. 1), the wet-to-dry weight ratio (Fig. 2a), protein concentration in the BALF (Fig. 2b), MPO activity (Fig. 3a), inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 3b), and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 4) in the lungs of ALI mice. These results strongly indicate that acacetin might have a potential protective effect in sepsis-induced ALI.",

            "text": "Inhibition of pulmonary inflammation may be critical for treating sepsis-induced pulmonary injury. Pulmonary inflammatory responses and edema are positively correlated with pulmonary function, including airway pressure and the oxygenation index. Additionally, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and MIP-2 are potent pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the initiation and amplification of inflammatory responses during ALI (Cannizzaro et al. 2011). As shown in the present study, inhibiting the overproduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines decreases pulmonary injury in the sepsis-induced ALI mouse model. Moreover, NF-\u03baB is an important transcription factor that mediates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, by inflammatory cells. Intranuclear blockage of NF-\u03baB has been shown to suppress the expression of iNOS (Hatano et al. 2001) and COX-2 (Ke et al. 2007). Therefore, several current anti-inflammatory therapies target NF-\u03baB activity. In our study, we demonstrated that acacetin treatment markedly blocked LPS-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation in vivo and in vitro (Figs. 7 and 8).",
