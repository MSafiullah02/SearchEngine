IFN-\u03bbs are mainly produced by monocytes, macrophages, DCs, and bronchial epithelial cells in response to viral infections [4] . IFN-\u03bbs bind to a distinct receptor complex (IL-28RA/IL-10R\u03b2) that is primarily expressed by cells of epithelial origin (respiratory, intestinal, and reproductive tract epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and keratinocytes) and myeloid linage [4] . IFN-\u03bbs exert highly circumscribed antiviral effects through intracellular activation of antiviral host factors in the infected cells, similar to the type I IFNs [5] . Accumulating evidence suggests that IFN-\u03bbs have a unique role in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses targeting microbial infections of epithelial cells expressing cognate receptor complexes [4, 6] .",

The expression of type I IFNs and type I IFN-inducible genes is significantly increased in patients with SLE, pointing to a role of type I IFNs in SLE pathogenesis [7] [8] [9] [10] . High levels of circulating type I IFNs and type I IFN-induced cell activation are heritable traits in families with SLE, suggesting that the alleles responsible for a strong type I IFN activation pathway are risk factors for the development of SLE [11] [12] [13] . While IFN-\u03bbs mediate antiviral functions similar to the type I IFNs [4] , the role of IFN-\u03bbs in the development of SLE remains unknown as the IFNL locus was not revealed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [14, 15] . In particular, the IFN-\u03bb3 SNPs (rs8099917, rs12979860, and rs4803217) in strong linkage disequilibrium with the IFN-\u03bb4 SNP rs368234815 (TT/\u0394G) have been suggested to influence IFN-\u03bb3 mRNA stability, IFN-\u03bb3/4 expression, ISG levels, and the response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment [16] .

Three chi-square tests (the genotype test, the allele test, and the Cochran-Armitage trend test) were carried out with the SAS/Genetics software package release 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to determine associations between individual SNPs and SLE susceptibility. To investigate the association between SNPs and SLE clinical manifestations, we stratified the clinical phenotypes according to SLE diagnosis criteria and assigned those SLE patients positive for a phenotype as \"+\" cases and assigned those negative as \"-\" cases. The allele and genotype distributions of SNPs between \"+\" cases and \"-\" cases were compared. The additive, dominant, and recessive models were used to analyze associations between SNP genotypes and phenotypes. To investigate the independent association between SLE clinical characteristics and SNP alleles/genotypes, multivariate logistic regressions were performed. The additive, dominant, and recessive allele effects for each SNP were modeled as the response variables and two categories of cases (\"+\" cases, \"-\" cases) were used as the independent variables pertaining to each clinical phenotype. In addition, logistic regressions adjusted for age and sex were used to calculate P values, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of risk alleles or genotypes. To account for multiple testing, Benjamini and Hochberg's linear step-up method was carried out using the SAS MULTTEST procedure [19] .

We examined the single-locus association of four candidate SNPs in 831 SLE patients and 1620 healthy controls. As shown in Table 2 , all four minor IFNL3/4 SNP alleles (rs8099917G, rs12979860T, rs4803217A, and ss469415590\u0394G) tended to associate with SLE susceptibility in the Cochran-Armitage trend test (rs8099917G, P FDR = 0.009; rs12979860T, P FDR = 0.0225; rs4803217A, P FDR = 0.009; ss469415590\u0394G, P FDR = 0.0398). Nevertheless, the association between IFNL3/4 SNPs and SLE susceptibility was not significant after adjustment for sex and age (P FDR > 0.10).

IFN-\u03bbs (IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, IFN-\u03bb3 , and IFN-\u03bb4) are structurally related to the IL-10 family that transduces cellular signals through a heterodimeric IFN-\u03bb receptor complex composed of a unique IL28RA/ IFN-\u03bbR1 (IFN-\u03bb-specific ligand binding chain) and a shared IL-10R\u03b2 chain (a subunit of the receptors for IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26) [6, 28, 29] . The binding of IFN-\u03bbs to the IFN-\u03bb-receptor complex activates the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathway, leading to the expressions of IFN-regulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit viral replication [4, 28, 30, 31] .",

Interestingly, as an important target of IFN-\u03bbs, neutrophils also express high levels of IL28RA/IFN-\u03bbR1. IFN-\u03bbs inhibit neutrophil recruitment and activation, preventing the amplification of inflammation. Furthermore, IFN-\u03bbs could completely halt and reverse the development of collagen-induced arthritis [33] . As a key regulator to inhibit B-cell immune responses, IFN-\u03bb3 treatment dramatically reduced antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation and IgG production through suppressing Th2 cytokine production [34] . Taken together, IFN-\u03bbs appear to inhibit chronic inflammation through the actions of DCs, suppressive T cells, neutrophils, and B cells [33] .",

Nevertheless, IFN-\u03bb4 peptide produced from the IFNL4 ss469415590\u0394G allele is a dysfunctional cytokine [22] , which may explain the defective HCV clearance in Africans, Europeans, and Asians with the IFNL4 ss469415590\u0394G allele [20, 22-24, 44, 45] . On the other hand, the major ss469415590TT allele with a disrupted IFNL4 open reading frame is associated with the increased expression of IFN-\u03bb3 [21, 23, 24] . Our study revealed that the minor rs3682134815\u0394G allele carrier is also a risk for SLE susceptibility in the subset of SLE patients negative for lupus nephritis, indicating that the expression of dysfunctional IFN-\u03bb4 in combination with the low IFN-\u03bb3 production has a role in the pathogenesis of SLE. IFN-\u03bb3 levels have been linked to SLE disease activity, complement, and autoantibody (anti-Ro/SSA) status [46] . In the current study, we found that high levels of IFN-\u03bb3 were significantly associated with high SLEDAI and complement depression. The increased production of IFN-\u03bb3 in SLE patients with a high SLEDAI may reflect an intrinsic mechanism to suppress chronic inflammation.

We speculate several possible explanations. First, IFN-\u03bbs possess the highest cytotoxic potential as they induce more robust cell death than type I IFNs and type II IFNs [47] . Kidney cells express the IFN-\u03bb3 receptor and could be very susceptible to IFN-\u03bb-induced apoptosis, leading to necrotic inflammation and kidney injury. Indeed, we have detected both IFN-\u03bb3 (IFNL3) and IL-28 receptor alpha in kidney tissue, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism of IFN-\u03bb3 in the development of SLE nephritis. Second, the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as type I IFNs and IL-6 in SLE patients may reverse the anti-inflammatory action of IFN-\u03bbs, which subsequently exacerbates kidney injury under the circumstances of inflammation. Indeed, in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), while the favorable genotypes responsible for high levels of IFN-\u03bb production increase viral clearance, patients with the high IFN-\u03bb-producer genotypes were twice as likely to develop adverse clinical outcomes [48, 49] . Finally, the IFNL3/4 risk SNP haplotype may be in linkage disequilibrium with unidentified causative SNPs and/or may interact with other genes to cause lupus nephritis. Nevertheless, the IFNL3/4 locus at chromosome 19q13 has never been identified to contain risk gene(s) for SLE susceptibility by GWAS [14, 15] . The absence of association of IFNL3/4 SNPs with SLE in previous studies could be explained by our observation that the IFNL3/4 SNPs are a risk factor for SLE susceptibility in the subset of lupus nephritisnegative patients. Further mechanistic studies are needed to pinpoint the precise role of IFN-\u03bbs in the development of lupus nephritis.",

High levels of IFN-\u03bbs may have a protective role against the development of SLE in the initial stage, but the increased and persistent production of IFN-\u03bbs may predispose SLE patients to the development of lupus nephritis. Our data point to a distinctive role of IFN-\u03bbs in the development of autoimmune diseases and phenotypes. IFN-\u03bbs may be a potential therapeutic target in treating lupus nephritis.",

Schematic illustration of IFNL3/4 locus SNP locations. Sizes of exons and distances between exons indicated as base pairs (bp). First exon (exon 1) of each gene starts from ATG start codon and last exon (exon 5) of each gene ends at stop codon. SNP rs8099917 located in IFNL4 promoter region (3945 bp upstream of translation starting site) and SNP rs4803217 in IFNL3 3\u2032-UTR (52 bp downstream of translation termination codon). Two other SNPs (ss469415590 and rs12979860) are with IFNL4 gene. Figure S2 . Pairwise LD patterns of four IFNL3/4 locus SNPs on chromosome 19 show coefficient of linkage disequilibrium D\u2032 (red) and square of correlation coefficient between two indicator variables \u03b3 2 (black) of all subjects (A), SLE cases (B), and healthy controls (C), respectively. Darker colors indicate stronger LD. Figure S3 . ",
