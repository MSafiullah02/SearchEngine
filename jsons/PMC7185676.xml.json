            "text": "Chemiluminescence (CL) is defined as the emission of electromagnetic radiation (usually in the visible or near-infrared region) produced by a chemical reaction. Since the appearance of the highly sensitive photomultiplier tube in the 1950s, CL has been known as a powerful and important analytical technique. Some advantages of CL over spectrophotometry and fluorescence, such as higher sensitivity, lower detection limits and wider linear ranges, can be achieved with simpler instrument (no excitation light source and no spectroscope). In the last 20 years, the CL phenomenon in liquid phase has been widely applied in pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental and food analysis [1], [2]. One main direction of the current research in CL is to discover new CL reactions. Research on new CL reactions is very important since it opens new horizons for the technique. It is well known that the CL emission is frequently accompanied by an oxidation\u2013reduction reaction involving large free energy change (130\u2013340 kJ/mol). The present trend is to obtain and exploit on the so-called \u201cdirect CL determinations\u201d, which involves CL emission from the oxidation of the analyte. Many oxidants, such as H2O2, Br2, ClO\u2212, KMnO4, Ce4+, KBrO3, Ru(bpy)3\n3+, Fe(CN)6\n3\u2212, IO4\n\u2212, Co3+, Ag2+, Mn3+, PbO2, NaBiO3, MnO2 and N-bromosuccinimide, have been used for testing direct CL reactions in liquid phase [3]. When searching for a new direct CL method, preliminary work is to examine an analyte with a wide range of oxidants in many different media (such as H2SO4, HCl, H3PO4, NaCO3 and NaOH). This usually involves the trail-and-error screening procedures, which is tedious and time-consuming, or even expensive.",

In this way, quantitative structure\u2013property relationship (QSPR) provides a promising method for the estimation of the compounds\u2019 behavior based on the descriptors derived solely from the molecular structure to fit experimental data [4], [5], [6]. The advantage of this approach lies in the fact that it requires only the knowledge of chemical structure and is not dependent on the experiment properties. In QSPR studies, molecular connectivity is a topological method capable of describing the structure of a molecular by means of numbers named indices. In 2001, Calatayud and his co-workers [7] firstly applied molecular connectivity calculation to predict the direct CL behavior of substances in liquid phase, and later they applied the CL discriminant function to theoretically predict the CL behavior of phenols and polyphenols [8], ergot alkaloids [9] and pesticides [10]. In our recently published work [11], the new discriminant function of direct CL was suggested with cosine coefficient as a descriptor, and the discriminant function was applied to predicting the direct CL behavior of 101 compounds with a success of 95.05%.",

Chrysin and baicalein exist ubiquitously in herbal medicines. For example, chrysin and baicalein are the main active components of Oroxylum indicum\n[12], which is one herbal medicine commonly used in China and other East Asian countries, and has been officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia for a long time [13]. Chrysin possesses the potent anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation properties and cancer-preventative effects [14], and it is able to simulate nitric oxide released from endothelial cells, leading to vascular cGMP accumulation and subsequent endothelium dependent vascular relaxation. Baicalein has function to restrain the bacteria and reduce the permeability of the capillary vessel and the inflammation, so it is useful for cleaning the uterus and decreasing the degree of advanced menstruation, discharge and menostaxis, and it has anti-HIV [15], anti-tumor [16] and anti-SARS coronavirus effects [17]. Quantitative analysis of chrysin and baicalein with known therapeutic activity could provide useful information for the quality evaluation of the herbal medicines. There are several reported methods for the determination of chrysin and baicalein. The main methods are HPLC with mass spectrometric detection [18] or ultraviolet detection [19].",

Preliminary experiment showed that only in strong acidic media potassium permanganate could oxidize baicalein to produce CL emission. The effect of the type of acid was investigated by using sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and polyphosphate acid as the reaction media. The experimental results (Table 3\n) showed that baicalein gave the strongest CL signal in hydrochloric acid. For 1 mol l\u22121 HCl and 1 mol l\u22121 H2SO4, the concentration of H+ is almost same because the Ka2 of H2SO4 is rather small (Ka2\n = 0.01), but the CL signal in 1 mol l\u22121 HCl was higher than it in 1 mol l\u22121 H2SO4. In order to explain this phenomenon, we added the 1 mol l\u22121 KCl into 1 mol l\u22121 H2SO4. It was found that the CL signal in 1 mol l\u22121 KCl\u20131 mol l\u22121 H2SO4 was higher than it in 1 mol l\u22121 H2SO4. On the other hand, a small amount of Mn2+ (less than 4 \u00d7 10\u22125\n mol l\u22121) was directly added into 1 mol l\u22121 H2SO4, and the CL signal was enhanced. So, the reason was that in HCl media, KMnO4 could oxidize Cl\u2212 to produce Mn2+, and Mn2+ could enhance the CL emission of KMnO4 system [25].",

It was found that the mixing tube length of the two solutions also influenced the CL intensity. Fig. 4 showed the effect of mixing tube length on CL intensity. In the flow system (Fig. 2), the reaction degree of HCl and KMnO4 depended on the length of mixing tube. The CL intensity increased with increasing the mixing tube length in the range of 5\u201378 cm, probably due to producing more Mn2+ (Mn2+ could enhance the CL emission of KMnO4 system [25]); when the length of mixing tube was more than 78 cm, the CL intensity decreased probably because of greatly decreasing KMnO4 concentration. So, 78 cm mixing tube of HCl and KMnO4 was used in this flow system at 4.0 ml min\u22121 flow rate (per tube).",
