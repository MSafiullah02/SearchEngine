            "text": "The deregulation of the nuclear import and export machinery is a key marker of various diseases 1, 2. For example, many tumor suppressor transcription factors show cytoplasmic sequestration ablating their nuclear functions allowing, for example, uncontrolled cell division 3. The aberrant localization of onco\u2010proteins can also lead to their inadequate activation. Examples of aberrant nucleo\u2010cytoplasmic shuttling that correlates with tumor formation, progression or resistance to treatment include p53, FOXO3a, p27, BRCA1, APC, nucleophosmin retinoblastoma, \u03b2\u2010catenin, nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB), survivin and cyclin D1 3, 4, 5. Beyond cancer, many viruses including human HIV\u20101, influenza A, dengue, respiratory syncytial virus, rabies, Rift Valley fever virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus rely on the transport of specific viral proteins into the host cell nucleus to perturb the anti\u2010viral response. Therefore, inhibiting the nuclear trafficking of viral proteins has been proposed as a viable therapeutic strategy 6. Over the last decade, the research community has acquired a critical mass of significant knowledge on the constituents of the nuclear transport machinery. The emerging picture, while intriguingly complex, suggests that there is an availability of a broad range of molecular targets enabling specific therapeutic interventions. The transport of cargo proteins is mediated by several distinct types of transport signals that are recognized by specific transport receptors or via a variety of adaptor proteins. These transport receptors can then interact with components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and with the Ras family GTPase Ran. Many of the steps within this process have the potential to be therapeutically targeted for innovative anti\u2010cancer and anti\u2010viral therapies.",

            "text": "The nucleus is surrounded by an envelope composed of two phospholipidic membranes: an outer and an inner nuclear membrane that are 30 nm apart. The nuclear envelope (NE) provides a much stronger physical barrier than the single cordon of the plasma membrane. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum 7, whereas the inner nuclear membrane is associated with a network of intermediate filaments composed of lamin called the nuclear lamina. This acts as a site of attachment for chromosomes and as a shield for the nucleus 8. The NE functions like a selectively permeable barrier allowing macromolecules to move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm via a gatekeeper, the NPC. The NPC is a huge protein complex that fuses the internal and external nuclear membrane to form an aqueous channel (Fig. 1). The NPC is cylindrical measuring 100\u2013150 nm in diameter and 50\u201370 nm in thickness 9 and is broadly conserved in eukaryotes 10, 11. The molecular mass of the NPC is approximately 125 000 kDa and the number of NPCs per nucleus is highly variable among organisms. The average number of NPCs within a vertebrate cell is between 2000 and 5000 12 and has been extensively studied by electron microscopy (EM). In particular the development of cryo\u2010EM and cryo\u2010electron tomography (cryo\u2010ET) allowed structural preservation to be enhanced and purification steps to be minimized and as a consequence the detailed and artifact\u2010free analysis of the NPC 12, 13, 14, 15. These EM\u2010based studies revealed a highly modular and dynamic structure with a doughnut\u2010shaped central core with an eightfold rotational symmetry 16. A central channel is surrounded by three ring\u2010like structures, namely the cytoplasmic ring, the central spoke ring and the nuclear ring. Attached to this core structure are eight protein filaments on the cytoplasmic side and eight protein filaments on the nuclear side that converge to a ring\u2010like structure termed the nuclear basket.",

The transport of salts, nucleotides, small molecules/proteins and components required for the syntheses of DNA and RNA occurs passively by diffusion through the NPC. In contrast, proteins larger than 40\u201365 kDa must be transported into the nucleus through the NPC with the assistance of transport receptors. These receptors recognize the transport signals that are present on cargo proteins allowing their import (reviewed in 19). The key function of the NPC is to form a diffusion barrier between the cytoplasm and the nuclear compartment and to enable the nucleo\u2010cytoplasmic traffic of macromolecules. In addition, the NPC is also involved in other nuclear processes that include DNA repair 20, the cell cycle 21, chromatin organization 22, transcription regulation 23, 24, epigenetic memory 25 and RNA maturation and quality control 26.",

These bind the armadillo (ARM) domain in the C terminus of Imp\u2010\u03b1. The adaptor protein Imp\u2010\u03b1 also binds the transport receptor Imp\u2010\u03b2 through its N\u2010terminal \u03b1IBB domain forming a ternary complex 39. The small size and relatively simple sequence patterns of these basic NLSs have facilitated identification of similar signals in many proteins. The classical NLSs contain one or two clusters of positively charged amino acids, typically lysine or arginine, and are divided into two classes, monopartite and bipartite classical NLSs 40. The monopartite classical NLS is a short and highly basic signal. The two stretches of basic amino acids within a bipartite classical NLS are separated by a linker region that is usually 10\u201312 residues long, although longer linker sequences have been reported 41. In addition, several atypical NLSs that bind to classical NLS binding sites in Imp\u2010\u03b1 have been characterized, including the hydrophobic NLS from phospholipid scramblase 1 40.",

NTRs continuously shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, bind their cargo on one side of the nucleus and release it on the other side. The majority of the nuclear\u2010cytoplasmic transport receptors are members of the \u03b2\u2010karyopherin protein family with each member recognizing a unique group of cargo proteins or RNAs (summarized in Table 2) 62. There are 22 putative members of the karyopherin family in humans 63 that share only modest sequence homology with the greatest homology noted within their Ran\u2010binding domain 64. A specific architecture within the karyopherin family is the tandem HEAT repeat fold formed by anti\u2010parallel helices that are linked by a short intra\u2010repeat loop 65. These repetitive structures are inherently flexible and contribute substantially to Ran\u2010controlled cargo recognition and cargo release 66. Karyopherin\u2010\u03b2 proteins can either directly or indirectly, through adaptors, interact with their cargo. In addition there are six homologs of adaptor proteins that belong to the Imp\u2010\u03b1 protein family that have been identified in humans which adds a further level of complexity to this process 67. For example, Imp\u2010\u03b2 mediated nuclear import of the uridine\u2010rich small nuclear RNPs involves a different adaptor protein called snuportin\u20101 and, as in the case of Imp\u2010\u03b1, snuportin\u20101 binds Imp\u2010\u03b2 through an IBB domain. The karyopherin\u2010\u03b2 proteins are multi\u2010domain transport factors that contain a cargo binding domain, an NPC binding domain 68 and a binding domain for the small Ras\u2010like GTPase Ran 69, 70.

CRM1 recognizes NESs that are present in a large range of proteins that are structurally unrelated 72. CRM1 can also be recruited by adaptor molecules in situations where it does not bind directly to a protein that is to be exported from the nucleus (e.g. Exp5 cooperates with CRM1 to export large ribosomal subunits 73). CRM1 also participates in the export of the 40s and 60s pre\u2010ribosomal subunits as well as essential RNPs 74, 75, 76, 77.

It has been suggested that proteins with armadillo repeats such as \u03b2\u2010catenin, that are structurally related to karyopherin transport receptors, can directly bind to the NPC and are imported into the nucleus independently of conventional NTRs of the karyopherin\u2010\u03b2 type. Other proteins such as the tumor suppressor proteins SMAD3 and 4 and the transcription factor PU.1 utilize direct binding to FG\u2010Nups to cross the NPC. Conversely, some proteins can be transported through their interaction with proteins that contain a functional NLS known as a \u2018piggyback\u2019 mechanism. Recently, Speese et al. reported a novel NPC\u2010independent mechanism for the nuclear export of RNP by nuclear envelope budding akin to nuclear egress of herpes\u2010type viruses 110. During this mechanism, RNP granules bud into the perinuclear space in a manner dependent on lamin C.",

The loading and unloading of transport receptors with cargo molecules is controlled by the small Ras\u2010like GTPase Ran and requires GTP hydrolysis 111. Ran is a 25 kDa protein that exists in two different nucleotide\u2010bound states: RanGDP and RanGTP 112, 113. Ran hydrolyzes GTP very slowly and interacts with regulatory proteins including RanGAP1 (Ran GTPase activating protein 1) and RanBP1 that significantly increase GTP hydrolysis by Ran 114. Conversely, the Ran regulatory protein RanGTP exchange factor (RanGEF, also termed RCC1 in human cells) accelerates the exchange of nucleotides restoring the pool of the RanGTP. RanGAP1 is exclusively cytoplasmic 115 and RanBP1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm 116 whereas RanGEF is nuclear. As a consequence of this strict nuclear localization of RanGEF and cytoplasmic RanGAP1, Ran in complex with GTP is localized mostly in the nucleus and RanGDP (Ran in complex with GDP) in the cytoplasm 62. This RanGTP gradient provides directionality to nuclear\u2010cytoplasmic transport because importins and exportins differ in the way they utilize the RanGTP gradient 117. Import complexes are dissociated by RanGTP binding in contrast to export complexes which are formed by association with RanGTP. Both importins and exportins bind RanGTP directly 52, 118, 119 and use the metabolic energy supplied by the RanGTPase system for directional transport 120, 121. Importins bind their cargo at low RanGTP level (in the cytoplasm) and traverse the NPC as dimeric complexes transporting cargo (Fig. 2) 118, 119. Exportins act in an opposite manner, recruiting their cargo at high RanGTP levels in the nucleus (Fig. 2) 84, 88. The RanGTP\u2010exportin\u2010cargo complex crosses the NPC into the cytoplasm where it disassembles following GTPase activation releasing the transported cargo. The free export in translocates back into the nucleus to mediate another round of export.",

The pre\u2010mRNA is processed and packaged into messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes to be exported through bulk or specific export. The majority of poly\u2010A transcripts are exported via the non\u2010karyopherin heterodimer Nxf1/Nxt1 independently of the RanGTP gradient. Conversely, a specific subset of endogenous transcripts is exported from the nucleus via CRM1. For efficient export, RNAs must undergo processing that includes splicing, 3\u2032\u2010end formation of the poly\u2010A tail and the addition of a methyl\u20107\u2010guanosine (m7G) cap structure to their 5\u2032\u2010ends 144, 145, 146. For the majority of transcripts, the m7G cap recruits the CBC, which then activates export factors that allow the export mRNPs to bind to the NPC and traverse the hydrophobic central channel. Nxf1 (also known as TAP) 147) is the major driver of interaction between the export mRNP and the NPC. The Nxf1/Nxt1 heterodimer is recruited to the mRNP via the transcription\u2010export (TREX) complex 79, 144, 145, 148, 149, 150.

Although the majority of mRNAs use the Nxf1 receptor to cross the NPC, subsets of transcripts are exported via the general CRM1 pathway. Additionally, through protein cofactors, CRM1 is involved in the export of specific types of mRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (U snRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs. CRM1 does not bind RNA directly but via NES\u2010containing adaptor proteins that bind to RNA or other RNA binding proteins 148. Once this step is completed, CRM1\u2013cargo complexes dissociate, permitting the RNA to enter the cytoplasm and to recycle export factors 148.

In some cases the three\u2010dimensional structure of a protein masks its own transport signal as in the case of p105 161, the precursor p50 subunit of NF\u2010\u03baB. Upon stimulation, p105 is phosphorylated, the C\u2010terminal part of the protein is degraded and the NLS becomes accessible allowing the p50 protein to be recognized by the Imp\u2010\u03b1/Imp\u2010\u03b2 complex 162. Furthermore, phosphorylation within or close to the NLS/NES can promote intramolecular masking. In the case of Hog1p (high osmolarity glycerol pathway\u2010signaling protein) phosphorylation at Thr174 and Tyr176 renders Hog1p\u2010NES inaccessible for binding to CRM1 and prevents its export from the nucleus 163. Similarly NF\u2010AT2 (nuclear factor of activated T cell 2) contains two NLSs that can be masked by phosphorylation at a low calcium concentration. Following a calcium concentration increase, calcineurin is dephosphorylated and NF\u2010AT2 is imported into the nucleus 164, 165, 166. In the canonical NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, I\u2010\u03baB masks the NLS sequence of NF\u2010\u03baB p65 167. In resting conditions, I\u2010\u03baB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasome resulting in NLS unmasking and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear import 168, 169. One of the multiple regulatory mechanisms of p53 is its homo\u2010tetramerization that masks one of its NES sequences. Dissociation of this tetramer is required for its nuclear export 170. Binding of proteins to RNA and DNA can also modulate the intermolecular masking of localization signal. For example, the NLS of the Rev protein, implicated in HIV mRNA translocation, is masked when Rev is linked to mRNA and recycling of Rev is possible only after release of the transported mRNA 171. Conversely, nucleo\u2010cytoplasmic transport can be enhanced by phosphorylation of SV40 virus large T antigen 172 or Pho4 factor 173 increasing the affinity of their NLS/NES signals to the corresponding karyopherin receptors 172.",

Some viruses such as the vesicular stomatitis virus interact with Nups to inhibit the export of host mRNAs that encode anti\u2010viral factors and make the translation machinery available for expression of viral mRNAs 174. Similarly, the ICP27 protein of herpes simplex virus interacts with Nup62 and blocks nuclear import of proteins via Imp\u2010\u03b1/\u03b21 and Imp\u2010\u03b22 pathways 175, 176. Conversely, poliovirus and human rhinovirus block the nuclear import of proteins via the Imp\u2010\u03b1/\u03b21 and Imp\u2010\u03b22 pathways by viral\u2010mediated proteolytic cleavage of specific Nups 21, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183. Other viruses inhibit the nuclear import of the STAT proteins that are known to be key regulators of the cell anti\u2010virus response. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus disrupts the nuclear import of STAT1 by tethering the tyrosine\u2010phosphorylated STAT1\u2013Imp\u2010\u03b1/Imp\u2010\u03b2 complex to endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membranes 184, 185, 186, 187. Yet another way exploited by viruses to prevent STAT1 nuclear localization is to bind viral proteins to import receptors. The Ebola virus VP24 protein binds Imp\u2010\u03b1 to block its interaction with phosphorylated STAT1 and hnRNP C1/C2 188, 189, 190. The L1 protein of the human papilloma virus type 11 binds Imp\u2010\u03b22/\u03b23 and disrupts cargo import. Encephalomyocarditis virus exerts its inhibitory effect on the nuclear protein import of infected cells via its L protein that hyper\u2010phosphorylates Nups and binds Ran 191, 192, 193. In addition herpes viruses and HIV promote viral mRNA export by reprogramming the cellular transport pathways. The HIV\u20101 Rev protein facilitates nuclear export of unspliced or partially spliced viral mRNAs through the Rev\u2010responsive element, an RNA signature within these viral mRNAs 85, 194, 195. As a result, Rev\u2010bound viral RNA binds to CRM1 and RanGTP and is transported through the NPC.",

Therapeutic agents that attempt to normalize or to target protein localization are aimed at various regulatory components within the transport process, including the upstream regulatory components, the cargo proteins, the transport receptors, the Ran regulators and the NPC itself. In some cases, compounds have been developed to successfully influence subcellular protein distribution in disease states, including CRM1 and Imp\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitors.
