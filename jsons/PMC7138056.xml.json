Larvae density is, however, variable and decreases in the months before October. In these regions, where rainfall is rare and unpredictable, reports have suggested all year risk for dengue fever, with dengue seroprevalence ranging from 32% to 57% among general patients seeking medical consultations.7, 9\n",

Sexual transmission of Zika virus from commercial sex workers with asymptomatic infection might also be a possibility for those who attend the Olympics.10 By contrast, the Hajj and Umrah participants are more likely to be older adults, many of whom have pre-existing health problems, and about two thirds of them originate from low-income countries and the tropics where personal habits of mosquito bite prevention can be suboptimum.4 Also, Umrah and Hajj pilgrims' immersion in religious rituals could reduce personal uptake of mosquito avoidance measures.",

Health-care providers can be encouraged to use travel health visits as an opportunity to emphasise the need for personal protection against mosquito bites and sexual transmission. Health advice for individuals can be provided during pre-departure health visits that are usually routine for pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, by training athletic coaches on prevention of Zika virus transmission, their frequent contacts with athletes can be used to remind athletes about the need for compliance with public health advisories. Public health agencies in the home countries of travellers to Brazil and Saudi Arabia can partner with travel agencies and transport services, including airlines, to engage in communication about risks of disease transmission. Advice on personal protection can be reinforced at points of departure and arrival in home and host countries. Increasing the availability and distribution points of methods to prevent mosquito bites is also crucial. Similar approaches were part of prevention efforts for pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2013 during the Hajj.5, 13, 14 Methods for prevention of mosquito bites can be provided to each traveller at the arrival port before immigration control. Given that Brazil is facing a shortage of supply of insect repellents, global efforts will be needed to procure and distribute them in adequate quantity.",
