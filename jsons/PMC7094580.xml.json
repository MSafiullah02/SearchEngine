In the dog, B. bronchiseptica is one of the most common pathogens that cause canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) (Ford, 2012). B. bronchiseptica may act as the primary cause of CIRD, or infection may be secondary to infection with other pathogens that cause CIRD such as mycoplasmas, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV), canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Ford, 2012). The pathogenesis of CIRD is complex, and other factors such as immunological and nutritional status of the dog are also important.",

In addition, B. bronchiseptica can be associated with community-acquired infectious pneumonia, especially in puppies (Radhakrishnan et al., 2007). In a retrospective histopathological study of 36 dogs with bronchopneumonia, eight cases were positive for B. bronchiseptica by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Taha-Abdelaziz et al., 2016). However, in most cases (6 of 8 cases) bacterial agents had not been noted in the pathology report based on examination of haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections. Moreover, since B. bronchiseptica can be detected from healthy puppies, the key factors in developing fatal pneumonia are unknown.",

Histopathologically, severe suppurative bronchopneumonia with bacterial ciliary adhesion was observed in the lungs of the puppies. Cilia-adherent bacteria in the respiratory tract are a characteristic histopathological finding of B. bronchiseptica infection (Caswell and Williams, 2016). However, this finding may not be evident in cases of fatal bronchopneumonia, and IHC and PCR examination are required in such cases to detect the aetiological agent (Taha-Abdelaziz et al., 2016). In the present study, large numbers of cilia-adherent bacteria were found on HE-stained sections of the lungs, indicating severe infection by B. bronchiseptica. Cilia-adhesion, together with production of toxins by B. bronchiseptica, induces ciliostasis of respiratory epithelial cells and further causes secondary infections of other pathogens. Additionally, as shown in the present study, B. bronchiseptica can enter and survive within inflammatory cells and affect the immune system of the host. In the present study, other pathogens were not detected by histopathology or real-time PCR, indicating that B. bronchiseptica infection was the primary cause of the fatal bronchopneumonia. There is genetic diversity in B. bronchiseptica strains; however, the relationship between strains and pathogenicity remains uncertain.",
