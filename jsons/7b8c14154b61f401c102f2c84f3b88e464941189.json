In contrast, the HRV genome has an RNA structure known as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which binds to the ribosomal complex independently of eIF4G, and so translation of HRV RNA is unimpeded. The 2A protease also cleaves nuclear pore proteins which impedes communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm. One consequence of these activities is that cellular RNA levels may not reflect protein synthesis. HRV infection also inhibits transcription of cellular RNA but not viral RNA.

The more severe end of the illness spectrum is known as bronchiolitis and includes many clinical features of acute asthma, including wheezing, rapid breathing, and sometimes hypoxia and hypoventilation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is particularly likely to cause lower respiratory tract infection, and accounts for about half of the cases of bronchiolitis in the winter months.

Although lung parenchyma is at core temperature (37\u00b0C), airways are considerably cooler, and temperatures in large and medium sized airways are ideal for HRV replication (44) . In fact, HRV has been detected in lower airway fluids and cells and after experimental infection of the upper airway (45) (46) (47) .

A causal role for viruses in asthma seems plausible because the lungs and the immune system are growing and developing during infancy, and might be especially vulnerable (185) . ss, single stranded; ds, double stranded; (+) and ()) refer to the polarity of the genome. to pathogens during this period of time (52) . Alternatively, it is also possible that the relationship is not causal, and that virus-induced wheezing episodes instead reveal a preexisting tendency for asthma secondary to impaired lung physiology or antiviral responses. In fact, immunologic and lung-specific risk factors for more severe viral respiratory illnesses have been identified and are discussed in detail later in this chapter. This theory suggests that some children are either born with or soon acquire abnormal lung physiology, and then infection with a respiratory virus, such as HRV, presents the first noxious stimulus to provoke wheezing. A third possibility, which combines elements of the first two, is a 'two hit hypothesis' in which viral infections promote asthma mainly in predisposed children (53, 54) . For example, infants who are predisposed to have poor antiviral responses would develop more severe illness during infections with respiratory viruses. These more severe infections could lead to increased damage of the lower airways during a particularly important growth phase of the lungs. According to this hypothesis, recurrent lower respiratory infections could hinder proper lung growth and development, leading to changes in airway structure (e.g. fibrosis) that promote asthma. This line of reasoning is supported by experimental findings that infections with viruses such as RSV and HRV in vivo and in vitro increase the synthesis of factors that can influence lung growth, development and repair (27, 52, (55) (56) (57) (58) . The pathophysiology of asthma is closely related to airway remodeling, a collection of features that reflect structural changes in the airway that promote acute and chronic airway obstruction. These structural changes include hypertrophy of airway smooth muscle, increased fibrosis, reduced barrier function, increased number of mucus-secreting cells and proliferation of airway vasculature within the epithelium (59) . These changes in airway structure are not present in most wheezing infants but appear to develop in childhood (60, 61) . In addition, acute infections with HRV or other viruses can induce the synthesis of factors that regulate airway growth, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and repair (Table 3) . Furthermore, viral infections can upregulate neurotropins that regulate the development of the airway neural network (62) . This effect on neural mechanisms could affect bronchoconstrictive responses to non-specific irritants, including future viral infections. In fact, increased sensitivity to inhaled irritants (a.k.a. bronchial hyperresponsiveness) is a key feature of asthma. How single or repeated bouts of virusinduced overexpression of these regulators of lung development and remodeling affects the ultimate lung structure and function is not known, but is of interest regarding the longterm effects of viral infection on lung function and asthma. These questions may be best addressed in animal models, and models to study effects of HRV infections in the mouse have been published (30, 31) , as well as methods for serial passage of mouse epithelial cells for propagation of HRV (63) . In addition, mengovirus, another member of the Picornaviridae family, is a natural rodent pathogen that causes systemic infections that resemble poliovirus. This virus has been attenuated to replicate, but not kill, epithelial cells, and when inoculated into the airway, replicates for several days and causes a mild respiratory illness that resembles HRV infection in the human (32) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 362, "text": "(185)", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 496, "end": 500, "text": "(52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1278, "text": "(53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1282, "text": "54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1995, "text": "(27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 1999, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2004, "text": "(55)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2009, "text": "(56)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2014, "text": "(57)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2019, "text": "(58)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2435, "end": 2439, "text": "(59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2552, "end": 2556, "text": "(60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2557, "end": 2560, "text": "61)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2848, "end": 2852, "text": "(62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3523, "end": 3527, "text": "(30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3528, "end": 3531, "text": "31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3621, "end": 3625, "text": "(63)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 4007, "end": 4011, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2719, "end": 2728, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Clinical evidence of virus-allergen interactions"}, {"text": "A number of other risk factors for developing asthma after recurrent wheezing in the first few years of life have been identified.

For example, a case control study conducted in Finland demonstrated that infants hospitalized with HRV-induced wheezing were found to have a particularly high risk for subsequent asthma, and this relationship persisted at least through adolescence (69, 70) . This finding is further supported by the results of two birth cohort studies. The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study is a high-risk birth cohort study in which families with at least one parent with allergies or asthma were enrolled prenatally, and both immune development and respiratory illnesses were prospectively evaluated (53) . Through the use of PCR-based diagnostics, viral etiologies were identified in 90% of wheezing illnesses. Notably, moderate to severe HRV infections (with and without wheezing) during infancy were a significant risk factor (odds ratio = 10) for persistent wheezing at (71) . Moreover, HRV wheezing illnesses in the first 3 years of life were significantly associated with the development of asthma at age 6 years (72) . The combination of allergic sensitization and HRV-induced wheezing by age 3 years was associated with the highest risk of developing asthma. Similarly, in an Australian birth cohort study, Kusel and colleagues (73) enrolled 198 babies and compared viral respiratory illnesses in the first year of life to subsequent respiratory outcomes.

In addition to the release of IFNs, epithelial cells produce a large array of cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators to induce the influx of leukocytes and cause respiratory inflammation. To facilitate HRV-mediated signaling, the expression of certain signaling molecules and transcription factors from epithelial cells is induced in response to HRV. Additionally, exposure of epithelial cells to HRV also induces the release of growth factors, which can serve to prolong the life of infiltrating leukocytes, and may contribute to airway remodeling seen in the lungs of asthmatics. It is worth noting that more comprehensive HRV-induced gene expression profiles are provided in a few studies (27, 98, 149) . Monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and presumably DCs secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-10, IFN-a, and IFN-c in response to HRV infection ( Table 5) ; these cytokines activate other cells in the environment and are potent inducers of adhesion molecules.

The use of BEC is highly relevant as these cells are the primary site for a HRV infection in the lower airway. Using this model, Wark et al. (148) found HRV-16 replication was increased and IFN-b responses were diminished in BEC from asthmatic patients.

In addition, after experimental inoculation with HRV-16, the fall in lung function, i.e. forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV 1 ), was inversely proportional to IFN-k generation previously noted.

However, eosinophils are able to stimulate the proliferation of HRV-specific T-cell clones (166) , and there is evidence that HRV infections can enhance the eosinophilic response to allergen challenge in vivo (167, 168) .

On one hand, viral infections compromise the barrier function of the airway epithelium and could lead to enhanced absorption of allergens and \u2044 or irritants across the airway wall and increased allergic inflammation. Alternatively, HRV replication in vitro is greater in damaged epithelium (99, 161) , and this implies that allergen-induced damages to airway epithelium could promote greater viral replication and more severe clinical illness. This concept could also apply to pollutants, and explain why exposure to toxic agents (e.g. tobacco smoke, NO2) also increases the risk of viral wheeze (171, 172) . Notably, there is evidence that epithelial repair mechanisms are be abnormal in asthma (59) , suggesting that noxious environmental stimuli could compromise epithelial barrier function, and thus disproportionately increase susceptibility to HRV replication in asthmatics.

Recent mechanistic studies have provided evidence of antagonistic relationships between allergic inflammation and antiviral immunity (174, 175) . For example, Gill and colleagues (175) demonstrated that cross linking of IgE receptors on plasmacytoid DCs, a major contributor to antiviral IFN responses, leads to inhibition of virus-induced IFN-a secretion. DCs can also play a key role in allergic sensitization, by directing the development of naive T cells into Th1 versus Th2 cells; the latter secrete cytokines that lead to IgE production (i.e. IL-4, IL-13) and eosinophilic inflammation (e.g., IL-5). Thymic stromal lymphopoeitin (TSLP) is an epithelialderived cytokine that acts on DCs to promote Th2 differentiation (176) , and this cytokine can be induced by HRV infection through a TLR3-dependent mechanism (177) . Furthermore, TLR-3-induced secretion of TSLP is enhanced by IL-4, suggesting that virus infection in allergic airways could intensify Th2 inflammatory responses (177) . Interestingly, TSLP and IFN-b responses in epithelial cells may be reciprocally regulated (178, 179) , suggesting that high levels of TSLP in the airways could potentially impair antiviral responses. Finally, allergic inflammation and viral infections synergistically enhance mucus secretion in mice (180); excess secretion of mucus can lead to plugging and closure of the airways in asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 247, "text": "(174,", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "175)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 288, "end": 293, "text": "(175)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 832, "end": 837, "text": "(176)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 925, "end": 930, "text": "(177)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1099, "text": "(177)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1197, "text": "(178,", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1202, "text": "179)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of virus-allergen interactions"}, {"text": "Third, viral infections could enhance allergic inflammation.

Major group HRV binds to ICAM-1 and minor group HRV binds to LDLR receptors on the surface of cells, such as epithelial cells and leukocytes that would be abundant in the airway, to induce downstream signaling. The receptor and signaling pathways induced by HRVC serotypes has yet to be elucidated. (A) Upon ligation of HRV to surface receptors on epithelial cells, direct uncoating of viral RNA or clathrin-mediated endocytosis leads to the release \u2044 replication of HRV RNA into the cytoplasm. This viral RNA is detected by endosomal receptors, such as TLR3, to propagate downstream signaling and induction of gene expression, including the production of interferons that can exert an autocrine \u2044 paracrine effect by binding to interferon receptors and triggering a JAK \u2044 STAT signaling cascade. Replicationindependent signaling is also induced upon HRV infection, and includes the activation of Src, Syk, and MAPK signaling cascades. Yellow solid lines: data to support link; Dashed lines: indirectly connected (may have signaling molecules in between); Red lines: signaling induced by product of HRVinduced gene transcription; Green lines: replication-dependent signaling. (B) Unlike epithelial cells, HRV-signaling in monocytic cells is thought to be replication independent, as viral replication in these cells is inefficient. In monocytic cells, such as alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes, HRV induces the activation of both NF-jB and the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) cascades. Transcriptional activation after HRV binding leads to the induction of gene expression, including IFNs that bind to IFN receptors on the surface of both monocytic and epithelial cells, to induce downstream JAK \u2044 STAT signaling and further gene expression.
