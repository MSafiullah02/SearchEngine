There\nis broad agreement in the infectious disease community about possible modes of respiratory\nvirus transmission between humans (Tellier et al. 2019). Direct or indirect \u201ccontact\u201d modes require a susceptible individual to\nphysically touch themselves with, for example, a virus-contaminated hand; \u201cdirect\u201d indicates\nthat person-to-person contact transfers the virus between infected and susceptible hosts\n(such as by a handshake), while \u201cindirect\u201d implies transmission via a \u201cfomite,\u201d which is an\nobject like a hand-rail or paper tissue that has been contaminated with infectious virus. In\ncontrast, airborne transmission may occur by two distinct modes and requires no physical\ncontact between infected and susceptible individuals. During a sneeze or a cough, \u201cdroplet\nsprays\u201d of virus-laden respiratory tract fluid, typically greater than 5 \u00b5m in diameter,\nimpact directly on a susceptible individual.

There is strong evidence now, however, that many infected individuals who\ntransmit COVID-19 are either minimally symptomatic or not symptomatic at all. In China, Chan\net al. (2020), Zou et al. (2020), and Hu et al. (2020) all reported the existence of asymptomatic individuals who tested positive for\nthe SARS-CoV-2, and virus transmissions from asymptomatic carriers have been identified\n(Rothe et al. 2020).
