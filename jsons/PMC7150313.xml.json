Evaluating safety of the feline blood supply reveals some unique features. The size of the average domestic cat makes \u201cborrowing\u201d technology from human transfusion medicine difficult. For larger companion animals, veterinary blood bankers have utilized blood collection techniques and systems used in the human industry. The total blood volume (325 ml) of the average 10-pound cat is less than the total volume of a standard human collection set (450 ml). Therefore FDA-approved, closed-system collection sets are not available for use with feline donors. Use of an open system for collection, most commonly a 60-ml syringe and butterfly catheter, can lead to bacterial contamination of the end product. Coincidentally, bacterial contamination with Serratia marcescens in feline units is the only published incident of external contamination of transfusion products in the veterinary literature.2\n",

This unwillingness frequently adds the necessity for chemical restraint through sedation or anesthesia; most veterinarians who collect whole blood units from cats use anesthesia. Ketamine and diazepam continue to be a routine choice for restraint during blood donation. Concerns for the donor's ability to maintain a normotensive state during the procedure have led to exploration of other types of sedation or anesthesia. Isoflurane gas anesthesia may be used to avoid hypotension associated with most intravenous anesthetics. The presence of these drugs and stress-induced cytokines in the end product must be considered. Traditionally, safety of blood products has been limited to monitoring the \u201cout-of-body\u201d experience of the product from donor to recipient.3 These issues surrounding the donor add an additional layer to the safety concerns that a feline blood banker must evaluate and resolve.",

Note that evidence of bacterial disease includes periodontal disease, chronic urinary tract infection, or open wounds less than 72 hours old.4 Presence of external parasites represents the potential exposure to infectious disease and should exclude the donor from use until the cat has been free of ectoparasites for a minimum of 30 days. Once again, because of the lack of direct information about the donor, biochemical screening before use is recommended. A complete blood count is a necessity. Abnormal cell types, indications of inflammation, low normal red blood cell count, and/or thrombocytopenia exclude donors from use.",

Using a standard operating procedure to perform feline selection, phlebotomy, and collection minimizes risk of contamination, increases the proficiency of collection, and documents the process to provide accountability. Each unit of blood is tracked from donor to recipient. Labeling of blood products includes the proper identification of the component, a unique numerical identification, the amount of blood collected, expiration date, recommended storage temperature, blood type, appropriate donor identification, additives, and the name and address of the processing facility.5 Many veterinary blood banks now use a barcode-style system to track product from collection to delivery. The path that the unit has taken from donor to recipient is documented completely, including storage and transport at any intermediate processing or holding facility. In addition to the paper trail, aliquots of the blood components produced are maintained at the principal facility of production to provide the opportunity for testing, if requested.6 If records are digitalized, paper copies are maintained for the life of the blood product plus 6 months past the expiration date. For example, feline packed red blood cells expire 28 days after collection and separation. Paper copies are maintained for 7 months. If records are solely paper based, copies are held for 5 to 10 years.3\n",

Giger4 describes the use of a sterile docking device and a pediatric quadruple bag system. Using the human pediatric quadruple bag system, 150-ml bags with CPDA-1 are isolated and attached in a sterile manner to 19-gauge butterfly catheters. This provides a sterile closed system that may be used either as a gravity flow collection device or as a vacuum collection system.4 The sterile docking device used in this technique is cost prohibitive to most veterinary practices. A semiclosed sterile system with onsite addition of CPDA-1 through an injection port has been designed by commercial blood bankers (Figure 57-1\n). Use of this system has provided a cost-effective means to collect feline blood by syringe or gravity flow and minimize the risk of external bacterial contamination of the blood product. Both systems use polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride as a base. Packaging in plastic allows for the sterile separation from whole blood to components. Glass is not considered a safe medium for blood storage because of its breakability and its inability to accommodate sterile component processing.",

The following recommendations were made for cats. Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus status should be evaluated by standard ELISA techniques, detecting antigen and antibody respectively. Evaluation for feline coronavirus is not recommended, because of the lack of correlation between antibody level and disease status. Mycoplasma haemofelis and Mycoplasma haemominutum are evaluated by microscopic slide evaluation and polymerase chain reaction (see Chapter 63). Bartonella henselae infection status is evaluated by antibody titer, blood culture, and/or polymerase chain reaction11 (see Chapter 4).",

More severely affected individuals may demonstrate signs of secondary infection, hemolysis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or even death. Non\u2013immune-related transfusion reactions are caused by circulatory overload, hemolysis resulting from storage lesion, bacterial contamination, hypothermia, and hypocalcemia. Rarely, pulmonary thromboembolism may occur post-transfusion as a non\u2013immune-related reaction.
