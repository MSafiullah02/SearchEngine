            "text": "Pancreatic islet transplantation has the potential to become the most physiologically advantageous and minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Since the first clinical islet transplantation was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1974 [1], the results have been far from ideal for more than two decades in spite of an improvement of islet isolation technique by Ricordi et al. [2\u20134]. The introduction of the Edmonton protocol, with a highly improved rate of insulin independency, encouraged us to promote clinical islet transplantation [5, 6]. In Japan, we organized the Working Group (The Japanese Islet Transplant Registry) in 1997 under the Japanese Society for Pancreas and Islet Transplantation for the purpose of starting clinical islet transplantation. The first issue of the Working Group was to construct a system of clinical islet transplantation in Japan including the registration of the recipients, procurement of the pancreas for islet isolation and transplantation of the isolated islets. In Japan, afterwards, various problems facing to a start of clinical islet transplantation have been discussed and we completed the guideline for clinical islet transplantation in Japan. The Japanese Organ Transplant Law was enforced in 1997 and organ transplantations using brain dead (DBD) donors were finally started. Since the islet transplantation was not included in the Japanese Organ Transplant Law because it was categorized as tissue transplantation, we were able to use the pancreas only from DCD donors for islet transplantation. The first islet isolation from the human pancreas was performed in 2003.9 and the first islet transplantation was performed in 2004.4 [7\u20139]. Sixty-five islet isolations and 34 islet transplantations were performed in our country from 2003.9.12 to 2007.3.11 [10].",

It is necessary to conduct inspection and palpation of the donor, as detailed as possible. Interview of the donor\u2019s next of kin and studying the donor\u2019s medical records are also required. The results of a pathological autopsy, if performed, must be reviewed. For all tests performed, conduct the most current methodology. Criteria and methods of tests or examinations must be always updated at a tissue bank (Islet isolation center), in accordance with technical and scientific advancements and new findings in infectious diseases. (It is desirable to involve experts from related academic associations in the process of updating the criteria or collecting/evaluating information on infectious diseases, etc.) In accordance with the principle presented in the above notification of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Safety Bureau of MHLW, retrieval of tissue is prohibited when a patient or donor corresponds to any of the following items in Table 21.1.\n",

The withdrawal of a respirator is rarely performed even though the donor is diagnosed to be brain dead (Maastricht category 4 [12]). Moreover, the donors usually are not examined to diagnose brain death, and thus, a cannulation into an abdominal aorta with a double-balloon catheter via a femoral artery and a systemic heparinization are not permitted before a cardiac arrest (modified Maastricht category 5 [13]). To shorten warm ischemic time and maintain a viability of the pancreas for islet isolation, we use in situ machine washout (ISMW) technique [14, 15], which was originally developed for the procurement of the kidneys from DCD donors. The efficacy of ISMW on clinical kidney transplantation from DCD donors is described in detail in another chapter. For the procurement of the pancreas from DCD donors, a double-balloon catheter position needs to be changed to perfuse celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery as well as bilateral renal arteries. We usually place the distal balloon in the aorta which is located above the celiac axis and only distal balloon is inflated. X-ray and ultrasound sonography are used for the confirmation of the collect location of the balloon. The University of Wisconsin (UW) solution is most frequently used as the perfusate of ISMW for the procurement of pancreas.",

The islet, however, consists of a number of cells; therefore, chromogenic dyes cannot evaluate the islet itself, while fluorescein diacetate (FDA) is used to quantitate the proportion of cells that are intact or that are damaged, which can evaluate the islet more precisely [29]. Live islet is not necessarily able to respond appropriately to glucose stimulation; therefore, in vitro biochemical techniques have predominantly been used to assess islet viability. Insulin release from islets after stimulation with high glucose concentration has commonly been used in static incubation or perifusion study [30\u201333]. Glucose utilization [32], protein synthesis [34\u201336], and oxygen utilization [37] have also been used to assess islet function.",

Four patients underwent two sequential islet transplantations and six patients underwent three sequential islet transplantations. Out of four patients who underwent two islet transplantations, one patient showed insulin independency, and two out of six patients who underwent three islet transplantations achieved insulin independency. However, all of these patients returned to insulin dependency from 2 weeks to 6 months after achieving insulin independency. The islet transplantation technique was performed according to the Edmonton Protocol. The isolated islets were transplanted into the portal vein using an angiocatheter via an ultrasonography-guided puncture. A steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen was used with sirolimus, tacrolimus, and anti-CD25 antibody according to the Edmonton Protocol5. As is shown in Fig. 21.1, the serum C-peptide levels were 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 ng/mL after the first, 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 ng/mL after the second, and 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 ng/mL after the third islet transplantation. The positive insulin secretion from the islets, as indicated by the serum C-peptide levels, resulted in the decreased insulin requirement: 39.7 \u00b1 18.0 U/day before, 24.2 \u00b1 110 U/day after the first, 21.4 \u00b1 11.5 U/day after the second, and 21.0 \u00b1 7.7 U/day after the third islet transplantation. In addition, the hemoglobin A1C levels (JDS) decreased from 8.8 \u00b1 1.8 % before transplantation to 7.5 \u00b1 1.4 % after the first, 6.5 \u00b1 1.4 % after the second, and 6.2 \u00b1 1.2 % after the third islet transplantation.
