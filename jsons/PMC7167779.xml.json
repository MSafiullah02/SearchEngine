The two primary options are to either increase the dose (mg/kg or total mg dose) or adjust the dosing interval to allow for more frequent drug administration. Current recommendations state that upon dilution of PRV to a concentration suitable for administration it should be administered immediately or stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 24 hours; unused diluted solution should be discarded after 24 hours.1 Combining this pharmacokinetic data with the limited stability information, utilizing a more frequent dosing regimen (i.e., every 8 or every 12 hours) may allow for reduced PRV waste, which depicts our approach to dosing regimen modifications in our patient population.",

The 1997 Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the prevention of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals suggested \u201c\u2026appropriate antimicrobial stewardship, that includes optimal drug selection, dose, and duration of treatment, as well as control of antibiotic use, will prevent or slow the emergence of resistance among microorganisms.\u201d24 Often a \u201cone dose fits all\u201d mindset hinders clinicians in the treatment of infectious diseases; a paradigm that needs to end.25 Reliance on an \u201capproved dose\u201d rather than achieving the target serum concentrations and exposures associated with safety and efficacy during the drug development and regulatory process is problematic. Underdosing and low exposures have been associated with anti\u2010infective resistance and increased morbidity and mortality,12 whereas active management of anti\u2010infective concentrations and exposures has been associated with improved outcomes.5, 12, 26, 27, 28 The concept of replacing \u201capproved dose\u201d with \u201capproved concentrations and exposures\u201d and tailoring dosing regimens to individual patients considering inter\u2010 and intra\u2010patient variability across populations is profound.25 With a growing body of literature demonstrating the benefit of anti\u2010infective TDM, optimization of anti\u2010infective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can dramatically change how infections are treated, allowing for customized and optimized anti\u2010infective dosing, and allowing for a longer \u201clife\u2010span\u201d of the currently approved antimicrobial agents and future anti\u2010infective pipeline.",

First, this is a single center's experience utilizing PRV for suspected or confirmed influenza viral infections. Second, a single pharmacodynamic target was utilized and there is still debate regarding the optimal clinical pharmacodynamic target(s). Third, blood concentrations serve as a surrogate marker and do not necessarily reflect the PRV concentrations at other actual or potential sites of infection. However, blood samples are more readily available and analyzable and are likely to correlate with the concentrations at the site of infection. Fourth, drug concentration measurements were performed as total drug and not unbound drug concentrations with a static protein binding estimate. Fifth, we utilized an opportunistic sampling strategy which may not be ideal to fully characterize the pharmacokinetics of PRV in each individual child. Sixth, repeat PRV levels were not obtained to demonstrate whether the dosage adjustments resulted in expected observed concentrations based on the dosing calculation adjustments and whether concentrations might potentially be supra\u2010therapeutic. However, individual parameter estimates are capable of providing a reasonable pharmacokinetic profile for individual patients and are commonly employed in clinical practice for aminoglycosides and vancomycin.",
