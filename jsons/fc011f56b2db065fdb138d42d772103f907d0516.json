HPV-associated cancers are more predominant in some tissues than others: there are 500,000 cases of cervical cancer reported each year. In contrast, HPV-associated penile cancers are rare (40,000 cases per year), despite no evidence of a disparity in primary infection rates. This implies a difference in the propensity of HPV to form neoplastic lesions at different sites. Doorbar speculates that this is due to a graded ability of HPV to replicate in different tissues. As further evidence, HPV-1 causes warts but no lesions at mucosal sites. Doorbar believes that the transformation zone in the cervix may be particularly susceptible to neoplasia formation. The exact host factors responsible for the variation in HPV replication ability are unresolved.",

In addition, proliferation of the basal cells does not stop when the basement layer is complete in high-risk lesions, in contrast to low-risk lesions. The increased basal layer proliferation is correlated with betacatenin activity and E6 levels (13, 14) . What drives increased E6 activity in some infections is unknown: wound healing, episomal copy number, DNA methylation patterns, and host genetic background could all contribute and require further investigation.

Initially, a stable, immature virion with a spherical, capsid shell composed of Gag is formed (42) .

Subsequent cryoelectron tomography studies demonstrated that, in fact, Gag is arranged in an incomplete spherical hexagonal lattice which, in addition, contains holes (46) .

Previously, it was thought that Gag assembled at the plasma membrane into spherical shells that resulted in membrane budding, with subsequent cleavage of the resulting thin membrane tether by the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery (47) (48) (49) (50) . Kr\u00e4usslich's group demonstrated that almost complete Gag spheres were only present at late-budding sites where functional ESCRT was absent (51) . Along with their observations that the immature shell is composed of an incomplete Gag sphere, they proposed a novel model for the release of HIV-1 virions: budding is initiated by Gag assembly with ESCRT recruited early to drive release (51) . The process can be, therefore, considered a kinetic competition: should assembly occur faster than ESCRT recruitment, release is incomplete. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, Kr\u00e4usslich's group was able to confirm that Vps4, an ESCRT-associated ATPase, appears in bursts at sites of HIV-1 particle production early in Gag assembly (52) .",

For example, immunisation with HA strain 1 (H1) will not protect against another strain e.g., H3, but will improve the primary response to another H1 variant years later. This relates to the dual function of B cells as both antibody producers and antigen presenting cells: immunisation primes T cells, via B cell antigen presentation, not just B cell antibody production. Thus, following primary exposure to another variant, T cell help facilitates a more rapid antibody response, including to newly encountered epitopes (66) . This is important in vaccine administration practices as it emphasises the importance of vaccinating not just the older members of society but also the young, so as to afford them lymphocyte memory.",

The multifunctional HIV accessory protein Nef optimises the cellular environment for viral replication via associations with a number of host factors. It has been shown that Nef is able to downregulate expression of major histocompatability molecule (MHC)-I and -II and the MHCII-binding protein CD4 (72) . Jameel's group has also identified a role of Nef in the downregulation of costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (73) .

            "text": "Participants at the Summer School learnt a great deal about how to approach their work from the top-quality research presented. The School embodied not just good science, but also a great atmosphere (Fig. 2) , epitomised by the inclusion of every-one in the birthday celebrations of speakers L. Enjuanes and J. L. Virelizier. Informal interaction throughout, and plenty of time allocated for discussion, ensured participants gained invaluable input from lecturers. Allowing all participants to present their work at the School further stimulated discussion and has led to new collaborations; an opportunity that would not have been afforded to the developing country scientists without the Summer School.
