Moreover, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) may also develop severe disease and is the leading infectious cause of death in children younger than five years of age.3 For both URTI and LRTI, viral infection is the primary cause, especially in children. Clinically, the febrile presentation could lead to the use of more diagnostic tools and antibiotics. Therefore, accurate and timely identification of the responsible viral pathogen could reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics and length of hospital stay.4\n",

They may result from direct interactions of viral genes or indirect interactions resulting from alterations in the host-environment or immunological interactions.20 Different pathogenic mechanisms may be triggered by different viruses, which may potentiate or inhibit the effects on each other.
