This is part of the Declaration of Geneva that many of us pledged to uphold when we graduated from medical school- \u201cI WILL ATTEND TO my own health, well-being, and abilities in order to provide care of the highest standard\u201d (1). If we are run down and do not have energy we cannot help others. The reminder given on every airline flight is true\u2013put your own oxygen mask on first\u2013so that you will be able to help others. Positive daily routines can be very helpful in stressful times including setting goals, exercising, maintaining a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, as well as connecting with others. Tracking one's goals helps to provide a sense of progress and accomplishment and for high power professionals is particularly important when their work structure is disrupted. Limiting news and world events updates to specifically scheduled times (perhaps when one is exercising and can burn off the stress) can limit the stressful inputs and promote coping.",

Focusing on those things in our zone of control is empowering and calming (3). Regular reminders of our personal values\u2014those which provide meaning and purpose in our lives\u2014help to ground us. Such things can include spirituality, religion, meditation, service, and family ties.

Such feelings can include inadequacy, uselessness, guilt for not doing more \u201cclinically relevant\u201d activities, perhaps even mixed with occasional feelings of relief that one is not currently on the \u201cfront lines\u201d in the emergency room or ICU. Loss naturally stimulates feelings of grief and mourning. Uncertainty naturally stimulates anxiety. It may feel as though we are increasingly hijacked by unexpected emotions including frustration and sadness. Naming our feelings, allowing them to be present, and letting them flow through us helps to complete the natural process of navigating traumatic events (3,4). Such self-care, including our emotional and mental health, is essential. Self-care is not self-indulgent\u2014it allows us to support those who rely on us. Social media may be helpful to some, but can heighten fear and worsen depression in others. On-line talks with mentors, colleagues, coaches, spiritual advisors, and mental health professionals are supportive forms of communication and all can be helpful. A regular journaling practice, including what one is grateful for, can also have a positive effect on our well-being (2,4).",

Have you been planning to learn more about AI, or a new development in your specialty? Many journals offer CME for engaging with articles, and there are many other on-line sources for radiology CME credits. One may be able to do maintenance of certification work as well. Can you give lectures on-line to your trainees, or prepare that lecture you have scheduled at a fall conference? A recent publication outlined many helpful tips for giving web-based lectures to residents (6). This can be an especially productive time to complete research papers and write the next grant. It may feel difficult at first to try and focus on such work, given all that is happening in the world. It can also be very satisfying to have a meaningful project on which to focus.",

Asking oneself, \u201cHow can I be more productive at home,\u201d can be a helpful question. Beginning to think, at least in broad terms, about potential scenarios and the associated business plan needed for navigating them, may also be helpful.
