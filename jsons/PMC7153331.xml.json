These NPs are effective in the distribution of medications to target specific organs and control drug delivery. These drug carriers not only transport drugs to sites of cancer or other target diseased organs, preventing damage to healthy cells, but also protect the drug from degradation [3]. Some of the metal nanoparticles (e.g., gold, silver, or PLGA) themselves may have dual functions, working both as carriers and as targeted delivery systems using the membranes of cancer cells, which contain tumor-associated markers. In a recent study, Fang et al. used a membrane from mouse melanoma cancer cells in the outer layer of PLGA nanoparticles. These NPs were stable and persisted in the structure during cellular endocytosis, activating the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and presenting especially to T cells that have TCR binding to gp100 and inducing the production of IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, the authors found that the PLGA covering membrane had receptors that allow interaction with cancer cells and delivery of the drug [4], [5]. Furthermore, the NPs were used to deliver drugs to the specific site of organ transplantation to prevent rejection. Systemic immunosuppression is a high risk for recipients of organ transplantation, as it uses high doses of immunosuppression agents that make them more susceptible to infections and in some cases cause death. Previous studies found that diabetic mice were transplanted with islets into the eye to prevent islet graft immune rejection in vivo using rapamycin MPs. The islets transplanted with the immunosuppressed drug MPs survived more than 1 month compared with the control (empty MPs), which rejected the islets in the second week [6].",

However, new variants of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic microorganisms have emerged and are becoming a challenge for designing new vaccines and adjuvants. Until now vaccines have been developed from live-attenuated microorganisms or killed pathogens (first-generation vaccines) [7], DNA vaccines (third-generation vaccines), subunit vaccines [8], and synthetic peptides (second-generation vaccines). The last three vaccine types eliminate the risk of developing the disease, but they must be used in conjunction with an adequate adjuvant or delivery system (Table 7.1\n). The combination of the vaccine with the adjuvant or delivery system should be safe, stable, and have the ability to induce long-lived memory B and T cell responses, preferably with a single dose and a maximum of two doses and be free from strict storage requirements [9]. DNA and RNA vaccines are safe but need a second boost with recombinant protein or DNA from another vector. NPs have become an alternative to targeting vaccine delivery to immune cells, improving vaccine efficacy with slow release, easy antigen uptake, and induction of humoral and cellular responses [8].",

            "text": "DCs are specialized APCs that coordinate the innate and adaptive immune responses to induce \u201ctalking\u201d by chemokines to start the defense against infectious diseases. There are three subtypes: plasmacytoid, myeloid, and follicular DCs. Depending on the subtype of DC, the cytokine profile will be different, and the responses may be protective or not. The interaction and delivery of antigens and adjuvants to DCs is a research priority, in order to optimize the humoral and cellular vaccine responses [13]. Follicular DCs are the key to activating na\u00efve T and B cells to initiate the adaptive immune response and the induction of long-lived memory cells. Lymphocyte activation is started after recognition of the antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR). The recognition of a specific antigen is associated with reorganization of costimulatory surface proteins such as CD40 ligand, CD28, CD4, or CD8 in T cells and CD40, CD80, and CD86 in APCs. The early molecular events that underlie the formation of the synapse are highly coordinated and tightly controlled. The B cells spread over the antigen- APC- C3 or FcR or CR, rapidly, preventing antigen internalization and phagocytosis by DCs and their posterior presentation to MHC class I or class II. Before the antigen is processed and presented along with MHC class II molecules to the TCR, antigen\u2013MHC complexes mediate the recruitment of na\u00efve CD4+ T helper cells. The DCs present the antigen\u2013MHC class II complex to the TCR, and the T cells differentiate into one of the subtypes of CD4+ T helper cells (Th). The interaction of B cell MHC class II\u2013antigen complexes with the TCR of CD4+ T cells is necessary for full B cell activation and production of antibodies [14]. The DCs are the principal target for delivery of the vaccine and hence for NP, although other APCs, such as macrophages, B cells, and lung epithelial cells, can present the antigen to T cells. Unlike DCs, macrophages induce high lysosomal activity after phagocytosis to enhance antigen presentation and thus effector immune responses. Nanotechnology has been improving antigen delivery, depending on the size, charge, and type of NP that can enter through receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), pinocytosis, phagocytosis, or special receptor targets. The entry of DNA vaccines using different types of NPs is shown in Fig. 7.1\n[5].",

            "text": "Liposomes are the second-most common type of NP, and they self-assemble in water under special conditions. They are composed of lipids, which have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail that maintain hydrophilic inner and outer membranes, in lamellar lipid bilayers or in multilayers that simulate vesicles found within cells [22]. Liposomes can induce cellular responses or humoral responses, depending on the charge, size, and lipid composition. A previous study showed that charge had the main role in activation of the cellular or humoral immune responses. The authors' approach was to investigate the importance of the antigen\u2013liposome interaction in immunogenicity and depot formation. They used subunit antigens Ag85B\u2013ESAT-6 (pI = 4.9) from TB, and \u201cCTH1\u201d (pI = 9.0), from Chlamydia vaccines and a model antigen, lysozyme (pI = 11). The injection of cationic dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA): trehalose 6,6\u2032-dibehenate (TDB) liposomes with associated Ag85B\u2013ESAT-6 form a deposit at the site of injection. By contrast, the anion disappears immediately. The cationic liposomes induce the infiltration of monocytes at the site of immunization, possibly mediated by depot formation. These liposomes induce strong T cell proliferation and differentiation through Th1 and Th17 responses, although the authors could not find DCs. However, DCs are known to migrate to the secondary lymph nodes to activate the T and B cells, which the authors did not analyze in this manuscript [23]. Previous studies have shown that DDA induces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines after infiltration of monocytes and macrophages in vivo [24]. One of the advantages of liposomes is mimicking properties of the pathogens, inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. The antigen\u2019s presentation to APCs depends on the membrane characteristics, size, and ligand-receptor binding. Liposomes could induce Th2 responses if the lipids are unsaturated whereas saturated lipids promoted Th1-type immune responses [25], [26]. Liposomes could be modified according to the needs of delivery to produce Th1, Th2, Th17, or Tfh immune responses. Cationic liposomes can increase the uptake of subunit vaccines as synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins; this can be explained by the interaction between positively charged liposome with the APCs that have a negative charge in their membrane [26], [27]. Another modification is the pH-sensitive fusogenic liposomes, which are stable in neutral pH 7.4, but in acidic conditions, the antigen is released and presented by MHC class I or II. These liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine and amphiphilic stabilizers allow PE-containing liposomes to form aggregates, due to the poor hydration of their headgroups, which can explain their high affinity to adhere to cell membranes [28], [29].\n",

            "text": "Another study designed a unique structure composed of inter-bilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles (ICMVs), which is stable in the extracellular environment but rapidly released in endosomes/lysosomes, thereby enhancing vaccine immune responses. The ICMVs carried the antigen OVA mixed with the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). This mixture amplified vaccine responses and upregulated the costimulatory cells on splenic and bone marrow DCs. In addition, splenic DCs incubated with the OVA+ vaccine MPLA triggered proliferation of na\u00efve OT-1 CD8+ T cells in vitro, suggesting that the ICMVs enhanced cross-presentation of the antigen. The same results were obtained in vivo after the vaccination of mice with the mixture, and the ICMVs elicited robust antibody titers that were \u223c1000-fold greater than simple liposomes. These results could be attributed to activation enhancement of DCs and antigen cross presentation [30]. The first use of liposomes as a delivery system for a malaria vaccine was in the 1980s. Ballou et al. synthetized peptides derived from the repetitive region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. The synthetic peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) proteins and were incorporated into liposomes. Immunized mice and rabbits produced antibodies against the repeat region of the protein with biologic activity correlated with protection [31]. RTS, S is the only vaccine against malaria that is in phase three clinical trials in Africa. The RTS, S vaccine has the central repeat region of CSP, and T cell epitopes localized in the C-terminal region are fused to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. This virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine also contains MPLA and QS-21, which enhances humoral and CD4+ T cell responses in the first 4 years, with a level of protection of 18%\u201336%. Protection decreased rapidly thereafter, with negative efficacy in some children. The problem is not RTS, S nor the adjuvant system, as both induce potent immune responses. However, the CSP part of RTS, S is an antigenic polymorphism, and T cell epitopes present on the CS protein that are incorporated into the vaccine are also polymorphic. To address this problem, the newest generation of this vaccine is coformulated with Matrix-M, a saponin-based liposomal adjuvant [32]. However, the vaccine protection against P. falciparum has not been achieved due to the short-lived memory cells and the evasion mechanisms of the parasite [33]. The first malaria vaccine was tested in 1967 in animals using Plasmodium berghei\u015b radiation-attenuated sporozoites, with a 100% of protection [34]. Hoffman et al. reported in 2002 that 10 human volunteers were vaccinated with irradiated sporozoites of P. falciparum strain NF54, and all of them were protected between 2 to 9 weeks [35]. This vaccine will be used to vaccinate 360,000 children a year in three African countries (Ghana, Malawi, and Kenya). The vaccine could prevent 4 in 10 cases according to previous clinical trials.",

By contrast, naked DNA-primed HBsAg induces antibodies after a series of four immunizations with 10 mg of naked DNA. HBsAg-specific CD8+ T cells eliminated P815/BALB target cells that had been sensitized with an HBsAg CTL epitope peptide in vitro.

These polymers consist of either natural or synthetic monomers that are biodegradable, are nonimmunogenic, have low cytotoxicity, and are easy to prepare. There are several polymers, such as chitosan, PLGA, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polycaprolactone, and dextran used as delivery systems [40]. PLGA is approved for human use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), while PLGA has been used to deliver drugs for long periods. DCs play an important role in the activation of adaptive immune responses, in which B cells and T cells activate and differentiate into subpopulations that determine which humoral or cellular immune responses eliminate the microorganism. Cruz et al. studied the delivery of NPs and MPs to DCs to create a biocompatible and biodegradable slow-release vaccine and effectively target the cells. The NPs and MPs (PLGA\u2013PEG) were loaded with tetanus toxoid peptide\u2013FITC linked to a Lys\u2013Lys cathepsin cleavage site and an anti-DC-SIGN antibody. The DCs targeted PLGA-based vaccine NPs but not MPs. The NPs were efficiently taken up with the help of anti-DC-SIGN antibodies and induced proliferation of T cells (Fig. 7.3\n). However, the MPs were taken up for all APCs, including the DCs (Fig. 7.4\n). New research is needed to understand the biology, antigen processing, and presentation needed to induce long-lived memory B and T cells [41].",

The evaluation in mouse model and the initial clinical trial on women showed that this candidate vaccine, intravaginally administered, has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of recurrent candidiasis [42]. In addition, this company tested a malaria vaccine in Africa. This vaccine had combination of FFM ME-TRAP+PEV3A (AMA-1) and was tested in phase I/IIa clinical trials. Although the vaccine did not show sterile protection, it induced responses on blood stage parasites and lower rates of parasite growth in human volunteers vaccinated with PEV3A, compared to unvaccinated controls [43].

The study \u201cEvaluation of the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Trivalent Nanoparticle Influenza Vaccine with Matrix M-1 Adjuvant (NanoFlu)\u201d was used to test protection in people older than age 60, but no results have been publicly released. The other study is the phase two trial entitled \u201cDose and Formulation Confirmation of Quad-NIV in Older Adults.\u201d In this study, 1375 subjects were randomized to seven treatment groups to receive the vaccine or an active comparator.

            "text": "Engineered NPs have revolutionized the delivery of drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines to target cells. NPs have been designed from metals and nonmetals, polymeric materials, lipids, VLPs, and bioceramics, giving distinctive physicochemical and electrical characteristics that specifically interact with a targeted cell or organ. However, NPs can enter easily into the human body by crossing lipid bilayers and may interact with sensitive organs [48]. The clearance and excretion of NPs is mediated through the mononuclear phagocytic system, the renal urinary system, and by biliary clearance. Macrophages phagocytize the NPs and keep them in the secondary lymph organs and/or liver using the Mertk (Mer) receptor (the same receptor tyrosine kinase family as Axl and Tyro-3), which is responsible for promoting apoptotic cell engulfment and supports platelet aggregation and clot stability in vivo [49]. In addition, Kupffer cells, which are liver macrophages, sequester 100-nm nanoparticles [50]. When the particles are \u22645 nm in diameter, they are rapidly cleared from the circulatory system via renal filtration [51]. On the other hand, some studies have shown that metallic NPs (MeNPs) have effects on innate immunity. Specifically, in vitro assays showed that MeNPs have some cytotoxicity and genotoxicity and interfere with cytokine production and gene expression due to receptor modifications. The response of the innate immune system to threats is mediated by inflammation and the production of cytokines, chemokines, free radicals (nitric oxide) [52], and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this process, there is an accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), generating stress from the proinflammatory signal (involving TLRs) on the MeNPs and causing cell death and cancer [53]. Other studies have shown that adenovirus VLPs combine with a gene to control Gelsinger's ammonia metabolism (encoding ornithine transcarbamylase), which invades all the organs and induces severe reactions that can lead to death [54]. Other severe side reactions have been reported as carcinogenesis or germline alterations observed in animal models, in which the VLPs can become widely dispersed in the body, and the viral vector could end up in the ovaries and testes [55]. Eudragit is a drug delivery polymer: poly (ethyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate-cotrimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride) 1:2:0.1. It has been reported that using NR8383 macrophages cocultured with NP/ERS, the NPs were close to the inner membrane of the mitochondria, as observed by transmission electronic microscopy. The authors also analyzed genes responsible for mitochondrial function by microarray and found that Opa1 was reduced in expression. This gene helps to maintain network morphology and dynamics and in the regulation of the signaling pathways for cell death, and NP/ERS-treated cells reduced glutathione (GSH), stimulating ROS production. Due to unbalancing of oxidant\u2013antioxidant homeostasis and changes of proteins implied in activation and autophagy, the mitochondria decay through phagophore and autophagosome formation, and mitophagy can occur [11].",

The physicochemical properties of the material could increase the uptake by the antigen-presenting cells, but they can go to other tissues that can generate adverse biological effects such as apoptosis or necrosis. There are some materials that can be degraded easily. However, the NPs (PLGA) had been modified to release antigens slowly to immunize only once and to increase the efficiency of protective adaptive immune responses. Nevertheless, intranasal immunization with NPs had been reported to cause lung injury through oxidative stress, which induced the production of cytotoxic cellular responses and inflammatory cytokines. Another problem with the NPs is the aggregation that may block the blood vessels in the host. Modifications of polymeric NPs with PEI have been used to prevent the recognition to other cells such as epithelial cells in the lung. Other technologies could be used as the single-chain fragment region of antibodies binding to NPs, which recognizes the specific receptor on dendritic cells or macrophages that may deliver the antigens to target organ. Other modifications in the NPs have been used as PLGA covered with PEG (PLGA\u2013PEG) and formulated with tetanus toxoid peptide\u2013FITC linked to a Lys\u2013Lys cathepsin cleavage site and an anti-DC-SIGN antibody, which help the delivery to DCs but not macrophages, with enhanced efficient proliferation of T cells [56]. Negatively charged NPs prevent the activation of the immune system and induction of immunotolerance, therefore preventing the effect of exacerbated inflammatory responses. Nanoparticles can also be engineered to be porous to increase the diffusion of intracellular proteases, resulting in earlier processing of APCs and presentation T cells [57]. In addition, some NPs carrying antigen and adjuvant in the same NP are less efficient to induce the immune response than the ones with adjuvant separated from antigens in different NPs. This may because of the competing effect of coactivation in several pathways [58].",

Despite advances in immunology, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of entry of NPs into cells and activation of the adaptive immune response and related toxicity. Some approaches inhibit the cytokine and chemokine cascade with DCs and T and B cells. NPs have great potential in immunology, although in-depth study of toxicity is necessary. In addition, NPs require molecules, such as antibodies or ligands, that bind to receptors on target cells to ensure that NPs only adhere to those cells. Any modification should be tested in cell lines or animals to prevent side effects or death. The synthesis of NPs can be shifted to methods that generate reproducible nanoparticles in terms of size (<10 nm, allowing elimination by the kidney), shape, and composition (biodegradable materials) to reduce cytotoxicity.",
