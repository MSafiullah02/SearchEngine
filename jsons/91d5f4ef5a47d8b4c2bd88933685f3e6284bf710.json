H 2 S is produced in the cells mostly through the reverse transsulfuration pathway (TSP). Transsulfuration is a vital metabolic process common in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that have been studied in detail in mammals including human and several other organisms. It has been demonstrated by different groups that defects in the H 2 S synthesizing enzyme system are involved in a plethora of diseases in humans including cancer and a number of neurodegenerative diseases (Wallace and Wang 2015; Bhattacharyya et al. 2016) . Although at high concentration H 2 S is a poison, at low concentrations, it elicits cytoprotection during oxidative stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a wide range of physiologic and pathologic conditions (Kaya-Yasar et al. 2017; Faller et al. 2018) . It is interesting that cysteine is sulfur-rich and likely involved as a modulator of ROS due to S-S bonds. To this end, sulfide-rich water in baths is routinely used in sanatoriums to treat multiple diseases.",

It was also shown in rodent models that pre-and posttreatment with hydrogen sulfide prevents ventilator-induced lung injury by limiting inflammation and oxidation (Faller et al. 2017) . Since hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas, its use \"as is\" for inhalation is problematic. Water-soluble sulfide salts such as Na 2 S and NaHS generate free H 2 S in aqueous solutions. Thus, diluted solutions of inorganic sulfides could be used for inhalation with a nebulizer, but an important drawback of these compounds is their regulatory status. There are no clinical data nor any documented evidence of sulfide inhalation, and it is important to note that pharmaceutical grade sulfides are not available. For these reasons, we focused on sodium thiosulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 3 ) that is an FDAapproved drug used in the treatment of cyanide poisoning, certain extravasation injuries, and for calciphylaxis associated with chronic kidney disease. USP grade sodium thiosulfate (STS) is available as a drug substance and also as a sterile solution for injections.",

Importantly, sodium thiosulfate was widely used in model organisms to mitigate lung injury (Zhang et al. 2019). Thiosulfate can produce H 2 S through a nonenzymatic or by an enzymatic pathway (Snijder et al. 2015; Leskova et al. 2017 ) and, hence, may be successfully applied in humans not only by inhalation but orally and intravenously as well (Farese et al. 2011) .
