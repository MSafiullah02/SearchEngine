According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECdC) [6], the evidence from analyses of cases to date is that COVID-19 infection causes mild disease, without pneumonia or with mild pneumonia, in about 80% of patients, most of whom recover spontaneously [6]. Conversely, 14% of infected patients experience a more severe form of the disease and 6% become critically ill [6]. The majority of severe cases and deaths occur among the elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions [6]. However, also younger patients can experience severe disease symptoms, requiring intensive care therapies. Considering that all the different age groups are equally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections, it is of critical importance that also the youngest subjects, who may experience from milder to no symptoms, comply with the self-isolation procedures in order to prevent the virus diffusion. In this context, a recent paper estimated that 86% of all infections were undocumented, highlighting the importance of the identification of infected people and the tracking of all the closest contacts to implement quarantine procedure and limit the spread of the virus [9].",

Indeed, 70% of pangolins are positive for the coronavirus, which shares a 99% sequence similarity with the strain of SARS-CoV-2 currently infecting humans [16]. However, this result did not actually refer to the entire viral genome, but was related to a specific site known as the receptor-binding domain [16]. This finding was challenged by subsequent studies that showed that SARS-CoV-2 only shared between 85.5 and 92.4% of the pangolins' coronavirus [17]. Furthermore, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not exhibit the same structural features as SARS-CoV-2 [18], ruling out the possibility that the recent outbreak of COVID-19 might come directly from pangolins.",

ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase that preferentially removes carboxy-terminal hydrophobic or basic amino acids [25]. ACE2 cleaves a single residue from angiotensin I (Ang I), generating Ang 1-9, and a single residue from angiotensin II (Ang II) to generate Ang 1-7, whose vasodilator, anti-proliferative, and anti-fibrotic functional effects oppose those of the Ang II generated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) [25].",

            "text": "A recent study showed that ACE2 is highly expressed in the mouth and tongue, facilitating viral entry in the host. In normal human lungs, ACE2 is expressed in lower lungs on type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. After infection, SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 stimulates the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the whole SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex, inducing fusion at the cell membrane. Endosomal cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by a low pH and pH-dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins [26]. Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate itself and spreads through the entire lung [26]. Given the critical role of endosomal acidic pH for SARS-CoV-2 processing and internalization, it has been suggested that the antimalarial drug chloroquine could exert a potent antiviral effect by virtue of its ability to increase endosomal pH [27]. Inside the cells, chloroquine becomes rapidly protonated and is concentrated in endosomes [27]. The positive charge of the chloroquine increases the organelle's pH with abrogation of virus-endosome fusion, ultimately inhibiting the infection [27]. In addition to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine has been considered as a possible candidate for short-term treatment trials [27]. Furthermore, also amiodarone has been suggested as a possible inhibitor of SARS coronavirus spreading by its ability to interfere with the endocytic pathway [28].",

In this study, the author found that the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is similar to that of SARS-CoV, further confirming the hypothesis that ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [29]. Notably, they also found that SARS-CoV-2 RBD harbours a single mutation that significantly enhances its binding affinity to ACE2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved with an increased capability to infect and spread among humans [29]. The identification of the specific RBD of SARS-CoV-2 might provide us with a unique opportunity to develop targeted therapies to halt the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, as carefully described recently [30].",

            "text": "It has been reported that in the kidney, ACE2 is highly expressed in the brush border of proximal tubular cells and, to a lesser extent, in podocytes, but not in glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells [25]. In earlier studies during the SARS outbreak in 2003, it was found that only 6% of SARS-CoV-infected subjects experienced AKI [32]. Although it was a relatively uncommon feature of the disease, AKI was identified as a fatal complication of SARS, given that almost 92% of SARS patients with AKI died [32]. In order to evaluate whether AKI was induced by active SARS-CoV replication in tubular cells that express high levels of ACE2, Lai and colleagues [32] investigated the presence of SARS-CoV viral particles using electron transmission microscopy in renal specimens from post-mortem SARS patients with AKI. They found that SARS-CoV was not detectable in any of the analysed patients and suggested that renal impairment was likely related to multi-organ failure [32]. They further suggested that AKI in SARS patients could be the result of specific pathogenic conditions, including cytokine release syndrome [33], rather than active viral replication in the kidney. Indeed, increasing viral infection in alveolar cells results in massive recruitment of immune cells, which produce large amount of cytokines, causing multiple-organ failure. That this might actually be the case in SARS-CoV infection was discovered by a subsequent study that showed that an interferon-gamma-related cytokine storm was induced post-SARS-CoV, leading to severe organ damage in SARS patients [34]. This process is not new to nephrologists, as cytokine-mediated inflammatory AKI has been reported in several clinical conditions, such as treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors and chimaeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in cancer patients [35], as well as thymoglobulin treatment in renal transplanted patients [36].",

The difference between the higher renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 versus SARS-CoV could be explained by the increased affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2, allowing greater infection of the kidney, which may act as a viral reservoir [29].",

Preclinical studies have documented that ACE2 is significantly downregulated in different animal models of severe lung injury [54, 55]. Additionally, it has been shown that the pharmacological inhibition of the Ang Type 1 receptor (AT1R) by losartan attenuated severe acute lung injury in mice injected with the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV [56]. This counter-intuitive finding is strongly supported by a study in experimental models showing that ACE2 blockade or genetic manipulation to delete Ace2 resulted in exacerbated lung damage and reduced animal survival after respiratory syncytial virus infection [57]. Altogether, the above complementary approaches suggest that ACE2 is protective in lung injury during coronavirus infection. Assuming that these circumstances are correct, how can we explain that ACE2 upregulation by ARBs is protective during SARS-CoV-2 infection?",

Indeed, TMPRSS2 is an essential serine protease required for spike glycoprotein priming after binding to ACE2 [20, 45, 46]. Increased expression of ACE2 by ARBs could induce the sequestration of SARS-CoV-2 on the cell membrane that, however, might not be paralleled by an increase in TMPRSS2, thus ultimately limiting viral infection. Whether this is the case, the TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat mesylate, which has been approved for some forms of cancer and hepatitis, might be a valuable treatment option for blocking multiple SARS-CoV-2 entry routes [21]. Additionally, membrane-bound ACE2 is processed by the metalloproteinase ADAM17, which cleaves the ACE2 ectodomain that can be released in soluble form. Even though ARBs can increase ACE2 expression in the lungs, we do not know whether this also results in an increased shedding rate of ACE2, with a consequent increase in soluble ACE2 that would act as a decoy receptor that buffers circulating SARS-CoV-2 and limits viral entrance in target cells. What has been shown so far is that the administration of recombinant ACE2 has beneficial effects following respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice [57]. Whether this could be a valuable tool for COVID-19 patients will become clear from the open label, randomized, controlled, pilot clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04287686) that is ongoing to assess the specific therapeutic value of recombinant human ACE2 administration in COVID-19 patients.",

Engagement of the catalytic domain of ACE2 by its substrates can induce a large conformational change in the three-dimensional structure of this receptor [58]. Even though SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein recognizes a site of ACE2 that is different from the catalytic domain, it is conceivable that the increased binding of Ang II to the catalytic domain could induce a structural change in ACE2 that is unfavourable for SARS-CoV-2 binding and internalization. Additionally, the generation of Ang 1-7 from Ang II by ACE2 can create a cytoprotective environment within the lungs that may counterbalance vasoconstriction and profibrotic processes, a key protective mechanism during coronavirus infection [56], consistent with the protective role of ACE2 in acute lung injury [59, 60].",

What we know so far for haemodialysis patients derives from observations from a study that reviewed the course of the disease outbreak in a single haemodialysis centre in Renmin Hospital in Wuhan University [65]. From January 14, 2020, to February 17, 2020, there were a total of 37 cases of COVID-19 among 230 haemodialysis patients and 4 cases in a staff of 33. In most patients, the COVID-19 symptoms were mild, with no patients admitted to intensive care units. During the epidemic, 7 haemodialysis patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The causes of death were apparently not related to pneumonia. Analysis of peripheral blood samples from haemodialysis patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed a remarkable reduction in the numbers of T cells, T helper cells, killer T cells, and NK cells in PBMCs, as well as lower serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, compared to non-haemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Collectively, this study reported that haemodialysis patients with COVID-19 are likely to experience mild disease that does not develop into full-blown pneumonia, probably due to the reduced function of the immune system and decreased cytokine storms. However, this report also suggests that haemodialysis patients are at high risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and additional prevention measures are essential in managing the epidemic in haemodialysis centres.",

For patients in home quarantine, therapy with Levofloxacin, rather than Azithromycin, is recommended after careful evaluation by the physician. In this case, empirical reduction of cyclosporine should be performed. Adequate hydration and the use of paracetamol are suggested in case of fever. For hospitalized patients, the use of steroids is controversial. During the SARS-CoV infection in 2003, the WHO recommended avoiding the use of steroids, due their potential inhibition of viral clearance and prolongation of the duration of viremia. However, whether this is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown. For this reason, we suggest maintaining the most conservative measures possible regarding the use of steroids.",

However, the therapeutic efficacy of Lopinavir/Ritonavir has never been confirmed and its therapeutic potential is still under investigation in an ongoing Chinese clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029308). This drug is a protease inhibitor that specifically blocks the retroviral aspartyl protease (retropepsin), an enzyme involved in peptide bond hydrolysis in retroviruses that is essential for processing the gag and gag-pol polyproteins during HIV virion maturation [68]. Given the high specificity of Lopinavir/Ritonavir against viral HIV protease, the exact mechanism through which these drugs may exert their protective function in COVID-19 has never been reported. Given the lack of solid proof for the efficacy of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, we strongly discourage administration of Lopinavir/Ritonavir instead of immunosuppressants as the limited benefit of this protease inhibitor is not worth the risk of allograft rejection.",

Coronaviruses inducing the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) were originally bat viruses that spread to an intermediate animal (civet cat and camel, respectively), which then exposed humans to the viruses. Genetic analysis of the coronavirus causing the novel COVID-19 outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) recently showed that their closest genetic relatives appear to be bat coronaviruses, with the role of intermediate species possibly played by the pangolin, although with some conflicting results. Recent studies shown that some bat coronaviruses can infect human cells without passing through an intermediate host.
