It has been shown to be both protective and damaging in a variety of different models, suggesting that its role in human diseases is complex. Considerable evidence has shown the role of autophagy and selective autophagy in cell survival, cell death, and immune and inflammatory responses related to the pathogenesis of complex lung disease [14]. Previous studies have reported that autophagy is an induced reaction in response to various injuries such cigarette smoke, oxidative stress, and treatment with TNF-alpha or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and different types of cell autophagy may have protective or adverse effects on acute lung injury (ALI) [7]. Accumulating evidence has reported that the excessive autophagic activity of alveolar type II epithelial cells plays an important pathogenic role in ALI [7, 20], and its inhibition is better to ALI [7, 14].",

However, autophagy, by virtue of excessive autophagosome accumulation in alveolar type II epithelial cells, may play a maladaptive role in the late stages of sepsis, leading to ALI. Two studies [13, 19] independently reported that excessive autophagic activity of alveolar type II epithelial cells may contribute to the development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) in H5N1 influenza patients. Inhibition of autophagy could be used as a novel strategy for the treatment of H5N1 infection, and studies have suggested that autophagy blocking agents (e.g., beclin1 and 3-methyladenine) might be useful for decreasing the incidence of ALI during the infection of H5N1 virus [17, 19]. Previous studies [9, 10] also reported that inhalation of nanomaterials, including starburst polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) and COOH-CNT (a functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube), induced ALI by deregulating the Akt-TSC2-mTOR signaling pathway in vivo. Additional in vitro studies reported that treatment with PAMAM or COOH-CNT resulted in autophagosome aggregation in alveolar type II epithelial cells. The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, rescued the nanoparticle-induced excessive autophagy and ameliorated ALI in mice. Smoke exposure also caused ALI, and smoke exposure can lead to excessive autophagy in alveolar type II epithelial cells [2].",

The miR-101 inhibits autophagy in the MCF-7 cell line [6], and the miRNA-212/132 family regulates cardiomyocyte autophagy [21]. The miR-34a suppressed autophagy by suppression of ATG4B in tubular epithelial cells in acute kidney injury [11]. Another study reported that miR-34a played an important role in the regulation of Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by the inhibition of ATG9A expression and autophagic activity [8]. Previous studies have also reported that miR-34a is also involved in various lung diseases and could regulate senescence in alveolar type II epithelial cells of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [4]. Our study showed a significant upregulation of miR-34a in LPS-induced mouse lung tissue and alveolar type II epithelial cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-34a by miR-34a mimics suppressed LPS-induced autophagy of alveolar type II alveolar epithelial cells, but inhibition of the expression of miR-34a by a miR-34a inhibitor significantly increased the LPS-induced autophagy of alveolar type II epithelial cells. These results suggested that inhibiting the excessive autophagic activity of type II alveolar epithelial cells was a mechanism involved in the increased miR-34a expression and protection against ALI. However, the mechanisms involving a miR-34a decrease in autophagic activity of alveolar type II epithelial cells during ALI still remain poorly understood.",

Thus, we predicted that miR-34a regulates alveolar type II epithelial cells autophagy by regulation of FoxO3 expression. Thus, the possibility of a regulatory mechanism involving miR-34a and FoxO3 was further explored. Alveolar type II epithelial cells of mice were isolated and incubated with LPS to simulate alveolar type II epithelial cell injury in ALI, and then transfected with miR-34a mimics or a miR-34a inhibitor. FoxO3 expression significantly decreased posttransfection after treatment with miR-34a mimics compared with a negative control in alveolar type II epithelial cells, while FoxO3 expression significantly increased posttransfection after treatment with the miR-34a inhibitor. The luciferase reporter assay was then used to characterize the mechanism of miR-34a as a regulator of FoxO3 expression during ALI. The results showed that miR-34a suppressed FoxO3 protein expression by binding to the 3\u2032-UTR region. We therefore concluded that FoxO3 is a target gene of miR-34a. We also transfected FoxO3 siRNA into alveolar type II epithelial cells to show that FoxO3 siRNA treatment significantly decreased the autophagic activity when alveolar type II epithelial cells were incubated with LPS.",

However, the function of miR-34a and its targets have not been reported in ALI and alveolar type II epithelial cells. Autophagy can be harmful or beneficial in ALI. Moderate autophagy protects cells against various kinds of injury. However, excessive autophagy, especially for alveolar type II epithelial cells, plays an important pathogenic role in ALI, and its inhibition may prevent ALI [7, 14, 20]. In the present study, the autophagy activity of lung tissue increased in an LPS-induced ALI model and in LPS-induced alveolar type II epithelial cells that induced injury to alveolar type II epithelial cells during ALI. The miR-34a was upregulated in ALI, which inhibited LPS-induced autophagy of alveolar type II epithelial cell injury during ALI. In addition, the results showed that targeting of FoxO3, an autophagy-related gene, involved miR-34a, and silencing of FoxO3 expression inhibited LPS-induce autophagy.",
