            "text": "Mankind is afflicted with a number of health issues, infectious, allergic, metabolic, neural, among others. Unfortunately, with rising pollution, excessive reliance on drugs and increased incorporation of chemicals in diet and day-to-day consumables, health concerns are soaring.1 Cutting-edge studies are unravelling the hidden mechanisms of diseases, and drugs are being developed, yet morbidity and untimely mortality continues. Killer virus, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi claim millions of lives every year, more so in developing countries.2 Allergies and cancers are more prevalent in developed countries, where irritants exceed.3 Although the disparity is largely getting fuzzy, and both forms of pathogenesis converge in exacerbating the immune system.4 The complexity and diversity of pathological mechanisms render it difficult to track the precise pathways exploited by the pathogens, allergens or mutagens. A myriad of factors have been attributed to the maladies. Proteins, in particular enzymes, are pivotal in signal processing and resultant pathologies. Proteases are fundamental to survival across all living organisms, evident from their 2 to 4% share from the entire proteome.5 Proteases have been involved in almost all health risks, which can be classified roughly into six categories such as serine proteases, cysteine proteases, aspartate proteases, threonine proteases, glutamic acid proteases, and metalloproteases.6 Out of which, specifically serine protease is particularly crucial as it is widely present, from virus to human. This review hypothesises serine protease as a quintessential player in majority of human morbidities and analyses the literature to find pertinent evidence. The scope of recruiting serine protease inhibitors to bridle the enzyme has been discussed. Overall, this review examines this ancient and diverse enzyme family in a new light, which is believed to be of therapeutic concern.",

            "text": "Serine (Ser or S) is a polar amino acid encoded by six codons (UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU and AGC), the highest number of codons for any amino acid.13 The human body can synthesise it, and it can be formed from glycine (by hydroxymethylation with the help of vitamin B) and in turn be converted to cysteine/methionine.14 Non-essentiality status of this amino acid can be attributed to its indispensability for purine and pyrimidine synthesis,15 antibody synthesis (the effector molecule of immune system), also sphingolipid and folate synthesis. Both l and d-form serine exists in humans, with l-form synthesised in the brain astrocytes, which in turn transforms to d-form by the activity of serine racemase.16 The dual configuration makes serine a complicated amino acid, as each form has different functions, with d-serine perturbation attributed to neural pathologies.17, 18 Named after its first protein source, the silk protein sericin, serine can be found widely. Serine-rich proteinous foods include meat, dairy products, nuts (almonds, walnuts, peanuts), gluten, sesame seed, and soy beans (surprisingly, those associated with food allergies). Serine is very prone to bindings, thus can lead to deactivation of the protein it is harboured by (insecticides are based on this approach).19 The secreted proteins of bacteria and fungi have been discovered to contain serine proteases, of which the serine residue is often glycosylated (N glycosylation).20 Glycosylation (the addition of glycans or oligosaccharides) of serine, makes the protease complex.21 This posttranslational modification is crucial but stochastic as it largely depends on environment and epistasis between genes.22, 23 Protease glycosylation has been linked to diseases such as diabetes,24 cancer25 and an array of neurodegenerative ailments.26 Phosphorylation of serine/threonine by kinases and dephosphorylation by phosphatases is the hallmark of signalling pathways.27 Further, the occurrence of serine in both l and d form in humans has been linked to neural diseases like epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer, schizophrenia.17\nFig. 1\nillustrates features of serine amino acid.",

            "text": "Based on substrate specificity (casein, albumin, haemoglobin, extracellular matrix proteins as fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, etc.), serine proteases are ramified into numerous types, prominent of which are trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, subtilisin-like, elastase-like, kallikrein, cathepsin, etc.7 The target of each of these serine proteases seem to be different (gut mucosa, skin epithelial cell, lung mucosa). The enzymes are divided into many clans/superfamilies (further divided into families), based on catalytic site topology. PA is a major superfamily (clan) of serine proteases of which S1 (trypsin-like fold) is a well-studied family.28 Here, the active site is generally made of three amino acids, Ser, His and Asp (the catalytic triad which works by charge-relay network). Sometimes one or more of these residues are substituted by similar amino acids. The residues play a critical and complementary role, despite their dispersed location in the protein. Trypsin-like proteases cleave peptide bonds at Lys or Arg, variations of the enzyme being tryptase, matriptase, kallikrein and granzymes.9 Extreme plasticity of this protease fold is conspicuous, and several domains to bind here are apple, CUB (for complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1), epidermal growth factor-like (EGF), fibronectin, kringle, sushi, and von Willebrand factor.8 Its role in digestion, blood coagulation, and immunity (executed through a cascade of sequential zymogen activation) is well-validated.29 Chymotrypsins cleave the peptides on the carboxyl side of Phe, Tyr and Try (the larger hydrophobic residues). The role of chymotrypsin in impairing cell\u2013cell adhesion has been validated. Elastase-like proteases cleave bonds at the smaller non-polar amino acids Ala, Gly or Val. Fig. 2\nshows the polarisation of nucleophile serine by a strategically aligned acid and base residues. Subtilisin-like protease functions by the same mechanisms, leading to a wide array of atopic conditions, although it is phylogenetically different. Overall, the enormous extent of diversification in serine proteases (isoforms, homologues, etc.) has occurred due to convergent evolution, and resultant polymorphism (from the requirement of protection against different attackers). Also, this aspect can be held responsible for the low substrate specificity and subsequent high IgE-reactivity among allergens. A study on phyto-pathogen insects revealed the occurrence of multiple serine protease genes adjacent to each other in the genome, implying frequent gene duplications in this family.30 Empirical studies on this enzyme have revealed their molecular weight (16\u201395 kDa) and conformation (monomeric to multimeric) varying widely, due to variable extraction, purification conditions, also, glycosylation and complexation variabilities. However, universally, their N terminal sequence is conserved as it constitutes the signal part.31\n",

Despite their nucleic acid and capsid differences, all of them possess a non-structural peptidase in their polyprotein, a serine protease.34, 35 In some viruses, the nucleophile serine of the serine protease is replaced by cysteine sulfhydryl as in picornavirus, yet sequence configuration remains homologous.36 Viruses like dengue contain distinct chitin-binding domain (a carbohydrate-binding domain) in this enzyme,34 which might be indicative of their ability to invade their insect vectors. Interaction of these serine proteases with host mannan binding lectins (MBL), the pattern recognition molecules have come forth. In hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza virus, MBL-associated serine proteases type 1 (MASP-1), type 2 (MASP-2) or type 3 (MASP-3) have been discovered to mediate complement activation by action on C4 (the essential innate host immunity component).37, 38, 39 Ficolins (collagen-like long thin stretches and fibrinogen-like globular domains with lectin activity), the oligomeric lectins are also part of these complement activation complex.39, 40 Evidence of different MASPs forming co-complex has surfaced.41\nFig. 3\nillustrates the MBL and ficolin-mediated complement activation pathway of pathogen serine protease.",

These proteases alter host actin cytoskeleton and impair their stability.45 Also, other Gram negative bacteria like Neisseria, Shigella, Salmonella, Edwardsiella etc. elaborate these autotransporter serine proteases which act as adhesins, attach to epithelial and endothelial cells, inducing pathogenesis.46, 47\nMycobacterium tuberculosis serine protease (ES-31) is known to cause virulence by immune evasion, so the drug isoniazid targets it.42 Lung granulomas where this pathogen resides is hypoxic and rich in cathepsin G-type serine protease.48 In a Clavibacter michiganensis subsp.

A planthopper insect known to cause hopper burn disease in rice, mediates its pathogenesis through serine protease and homologous proteins.30 More than 100 related genes were found in the insect.30 Scorpion hepatopancreas has chymotrypsin-like serine proteases.76 Spider venoms are also made of serine protease and possess proteolytic activity. One study found procoagulant,77 dermonecrotic78 property of these venoms. Some of the isolated spider venom proteases include loxoscelism.78 A chitin binding domain Sp22D was identified in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.79 Also, a number of chitin binding domain-containing trypsin-like serine proteases have been isolated from Culex quinquefasciatus.80 These domains are present in chitinases which hydrolyse chitins into soluble oligosaccharides (such as chitobiose). Bee-secreted serine proteases have been found in honey, which differ in compositions and might be responsible for the immunomodulatory role.81\n",

            "text": "Apart from the protein denaturants like surfactants, organic solvents, chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and metal ions (Fe2+and Zn2+), several inhibitors particularly inactivate serine proteases. Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and small serine protease inhibitors (smapins) are peptides or polysaccharides that inhibit serine proteases irreversibly and protect target proteins from degradation.5 Serine proteases can be inhibited by compounds such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTT), pepstatin, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor, ovomucoid, and aprotinin,60 although the inhibitors are not universally effective. Common features of the protein and peptide inhibitors include \u03b2-barrel fold, knottins, Bowman\u2013Birk family, etc. The protease inhibitors can be of many families, well-studied types being Kazal-type (viral, fungal, termite, mice, human (SPINK))122 and Kunitz-type (mostly in venoms, e.g. spider, tick, snake).123 Termite-derived Kazal-type inhibitor blocked activity of chymotrypsin and elastase.124 A spider venom-derived Kunitz-type inhibitor inactivated plasmin and elastase.125 Also, Kunitz type inhibitors have been discovered in the saliva of ticks.126 Both types of inhibitors have been identified in helminths.67 Kazal-type inhibitors have been found in jellyfish (Cnidarian phylum) and echinoderm sea cucumber (Holothuria glaberrima).127 Also, other marine organisms like ascidians and algae have been validated to contain sulfated polysaccharides that exhibit serine protease inhibitor properties.128 Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors were derived from spider which showed antifibrinolytic and antielastolytic effects.125 From scorpion (Scorpiops jendeki) venom gland many protease inhibitors have been isolated, which resembled Ascaris-type.129 It indicates that folds are often shared in these peptides. These inhibitors take part in immune regulation and parasite survival through interference with the host immune response, thus they amount to toxins as well. Specificity of the inhibitors differs and they can selectively inhibit any form of serine protease (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase). A toad species (Rhinella schneideri) gland has a serine protease inhibitor bufadienolide, specific to chymotrypsin.130 Mushrooms are trove of serine protease inhibitors such as cnispin (Clitocybe nebularis), LeSPI (Lentinus edodes), cospin (Coprinopsis cinerea).131 The inhibitor expression is induced in plants in response to herbivory, which inactivates devouring insects\u2019 digestive proteases. Inhibitors have been found from plants as Solanum nigrum.132 In barley, trypsin inhibitor (BTI-CMe) has been discovered that inactivate pest digestive enzymes.133 Sulphated chitin and deacetylated chitin (chitosan) have been validated to confer antiviral property.134 It can be interpreted that the viruses can degrade chitin due to their proteases, which favours their survival in hosts. But, the modified forms of chitin cannot be cleaved, so they perish. Fungi have inhibitors to deter the host proteases. Phytophthora infestans protease inhibitors inactivate the subtilisin-like serine protease of tomato.135 Use of these inhibitors to prevent melanin formation in mushrooms in proposed. Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor in chicken egg white is a major allergen.136 Many inhibitors have been identified in the human body, such as \u03b12-macroglobulin in human.44 Another study linked the epistatic relation between serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) as a causative factor for asthma.137 Inhibitors can inhibit at nM and \u03bcM levels. Kazal, Kunitz, and Bowman-Birk-type inhibitors inactivate their target serine protease by lock-and-key mechanism.5 An exhaustive review discussing a broad panel of protease inhibitors and their modus operandi can be an interesting reference for additional insights in this area.5\n",

            "text": "Many facets that ought to be investigated have been mentioned here. How human hormone influences the external serine proteases needs to be probed, as many allergens are gender-dependent.155 How metal allergens like nickel, copper etc. are linked to this protease should be looked into. A study in this regard has reported the role of nickel in reducing the stability of a serine protease inhibitor significantly, i.e. lowering the half-life of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 to barely \u223c5 min.156 It is alarming because again the unopposed serine protease seems to be causing these metal allergies. Which pathways are co-controlled by cysteine proteases needs to be investigated, as perturbation in the ratio of these two amino acids is linked to many diseases. A study on Chikungunya virus revealed that cysteine and serine residue in the catalytic dyad are interchangeably capable of proteolysis.157 As serine is prone to conversion into cysteine, serine protease and cysteine protease generally share high homology, and can be studied together as peptide hydrolases. The precise nature of the cross-talk with histidine kinase and phosphatase signalling should be evaluated. Although it is partially proven, the role of diet and alcohol consumption in deciding the response to serine proteases of pathogens, allergens, and human microbiome can be insightful. Many of the serine protease-mediated pathogenesis caused by virus (dengue fever, chikungunya, encephalitis), bacteria (meningitis, leprosy), fungi (meningitis), protozoa (brain malaria), dog saliva (rabies) target the nervous system, the cause of which ought to be probed. High myo-inositol leading to neuro-inflammation via activated astrocytes and microglia has come forth.158, 159\n",

However, it certainly leaves a lot to ponder over, hypothesise and investigate. Likewise, it is startling to find that all pathogens follow almost the same pathogenic route that revolves around serine protease or its homologues. It might also lead to the crosstalk of infectious diseases, allergies and carcinogenesis, as all three forms of pathologic manifestation arise from excess inflammation. Serine proteases can be developed into immunotherapeutic, although it is important to not meddle with this enzyme produced by human itself. As more literature is examined, the interconnections are likely to be clearly visible. Just the jigsaw puzzle needs to be assembled properly, which can be accelerated by revising our perspective, getting past the thought that clinical interpretations so far are written-in-rock, and looking at things in new light.",
