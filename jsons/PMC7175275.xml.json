            "text": "Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze is a member of the family Acanthaceae, widely distributed in northeast India, Bangladesh, southern China, the Himalayan region, Myanmar, and Taiwan [1]. S. cusia root and leaf extracts have been used extensively as a traditional herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities [2,3]. The S. cusia root (named \u201cNan-Ban-Lan-Gen\u201d in Chinese) has been commonly used to treat infections by respiratory virus, such as influenza viruses, mumps virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [4,5]. Several bioactive components from the S. cusia root, including strobilanthes A, 3H-benzoxazolinone, and aurantiamide acetate, have exhibited antiviral activity against influenza A and hepatitis B virus infections [5,6]. The S. cusia leaf (called \u201cDa-Ching-Yeh\u201d in Chinese) is generally used for the production of indigo dyes (Indigo Natruralis, named \u201cQing Dai\u201d in Chinese), displaying antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties [7,8]. S. cusia leaves contain effective chemical components with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities, including \u03b2-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin (6,12-dihydro-6,12-dioxoindolo-(2,1-b)-quinazoline), betulin, indigodole A, indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin), strobilanthosides A\u2013C, and phenylethanoidglycosides [9,10]. Notably, indirubin and its derivatives modulate influenza A virus-induced inflammation and have been suggested as antiviral and immunomodulatory agents against influenza A virus infection [3,11,12,13,14]. \u03b2-sitosterol exerts an inhibitory effect on the in vitro enzymatic activity of SARS coronavirus 3C-like protease [15]. However, the antiviral capability of S. cusia leaf extract is yet to be elucidated; clarifying its properties will prove to be relevant to respiratory virus infections.",

            "text": "Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, as denoted shortly after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [16,17]. HCoV-NL63 is an enveloped virus with a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome nearly 26\u201332 kb in size [18]. The spike protein, the major envelope protein of HCoV-NL63, specifically binds to the zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) identified as the receptor for pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and COVID-19 (formerly known as Wuhan coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and SARS-CoV-2) [16,17,18,19]. The virus is prevalent during spring and winter seasons in temperate zone countries. HCoV-NL63 is primarily associated with immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses, young children, and the elderly [20]. Symptoms of HCoV-NL63 infection include common cold, rhinorrhea, cough, fever, tachypnea, and obstructive laryngitis [21]. Recently, HCoV-NL63 induced an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in long-term care institutions in Louisiana. In 20 cases with patients aged between 66 and 96, six patients with pneumonia were hospitalized and three patients died [22]. Moreover, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from the blood, urine, and stool samples of children with febrile illness, causing systemic illness in rural Haiti [23]. HCoV-NL63 has become one of the primary pathogens in respiratory viral diseases; however, there are no effective antivirals for treating HCoV-NL63 infection. ",

Images of CPE in infected cells were captured using a microscope. After 24, 36 and 48 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2, HCoV-NL63-induced CPEs such as cell swelling, rounding, vacuoles, and eventual detachment were imaged using a microscope, in which vacuoles in infected cells were predominant [24]. In addition, the effect of stomach acid on inactivation of the tryptanthrin was further assayed. Tryptanthrin was incubated in 0.01 N HCl (pH 2.0) for 15 or 60 min, neutralized with PBS, and the residual activity of CPE reduction in HCoV-NL63 infected cells at the MOI of 0.01 was evaluated. In the virus yield reduction assay, the supernatant from untreated or treated infected cells was diluted to quantify the virus titer using the plaque assay. Serial dilutions of the supernatant were added onto the monolayer of LLC-MK2 cells for 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C to enable attachment and entry; the cells were overlaid using 2% agarose in MEM containing 2% FBS. After 48 h of incubation, the cell monolayer was stained with naphthol blue-black dye; the plaques in the LLC-MK2 cell monolayer were counted to determine the virus titer. The virus yield reduction was calculated as the reduced rate of plaque content in the treated infected cells compared to the untreated infected cells. Fifty percent (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated as the percentage of virus yield reduction by the abovementioned concentrations of the extract and active compounds. In addition, the antiviral activity of the active compounds was examined in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells at 32 \u00b0C; 1 \u00d7 105 Calu-3 cells per well were cultured overnight in 6-well plates, infected with HCoV-NL63 at an MOI of 0.05, and immediately treated with the indicated concentration of the active compounds.

Recombinant HCoV-NL63 PLP2 was purified with the HisTrap Kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) using the supernatant from bacterial cells sonicated in 10 mM imidazole buffer after centrifugation (10,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min). Meanwhile, the concentration, purity, and integrity of recombinant HCoV-NL63 PLP2 protein were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. The sample of the purified PLP2 protein was dissolved in loading buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min, resolved in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany). The PLP2 protein separated by SDS-PAGE gel was electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose paper that was blocked with 5% skimmed milk and then reacted with the appropriately diluted anti-His Tag monoclonal antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase in a 2 h incubation.

Among them, tryptanthrin at 40 \u03bcM exhibited the strongest antiviral activity with a significant reduction in HCoV-NL63-induced CPE in LLC-MK2 cells 36 and 48 h post-infection (Figure 3A). Indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) at 40 \u03bcM concentration was ranked the second highest in terms of anti-HCoV-NL63 activity in reducing virus-induced CPE 36 and 48 h post-infection (Figure 3A). In addition, tryptanthrin and indigodole B, which exhibit a low cytotoxicity in LLC-MK2 cells (CC50 < 400 \u03bcM), significantly reduced the HCoV-NL63 infectivity, as detected by immunofluorescent staining assay (Figure 3B\u2013C, Figure S1B\u2013C, Table 1). Notably, indigodole B is a derivative of tryptanthrin conjugated with the ethyl group at C-5a in R configuration, and is also known as 5aR-ethyltryptanthrin (Figure 4A). Subsequently, the antiviral activity of 0.4, 4, and 40 \u00b5M tryptanthrin and indigodole B was determined using CPE inhibition and virus yield reduction assays (Figure 4B\u2013E). In the CPE reduction assay, tryptanthrin at 0.4, 4, and 40 \u00b5M significantly reduced virus-induced CPE in LLC-MK2 cells at 37 \u00b0C 48 h post-infection, whereas the same effect was noted only for 40 \u03bcM indigodole B (Figure 4B\u2013C). Notably, tryptanthrin resisted stomach juice (0.01 N HCl, pH 2.0) activity for 15 and 60 min, during which time it induced CPE reduction and infectivity inhibition in HCoV-NL63 infected cells as well (Figures S2 and S3, Table 1). Moreover, the plaque assay revealed that tryptanthrin and indigodole B exerted a potent inhibitory effect on the in vitro progeny production of HCoV-NL63 (Figure 4D\u2013E), wherein IC50 values for virus yield were 1.52 \u03bcM and 2.60 \u03bcM for tryptanthrin and indigole B, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, similar to the S. cusia leaf methanol extract, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited low cytotoxicity and high antiviral potential against HCoV-NL63.",

To examine the antiviral efficacy of the highest active component, tryptanthrin, in LLC-MK2 cells, the infectivity inhibitory effect of tryptanthrin against HCoV-NL63 was tested in Calu-3 cells using CPE reduction and infectivity inhibition assays (Figure 5). The antiviral assays with human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells were performed at 32 \u00b0C and analyzed 36 h post-infection (Figure 5). Tryptanthrin inhibited the HCoV-NL63-induced CPE in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5A, top). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that tryptanthrin significantly reduced the percentage of HCoV-NL63-positive cells (Figure 5A, middle and bottom), markedly reducing the HCoV-NL63 infectivity with an IC50 value of 0.30 \u03bcM in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells (Figure 5B, Table 1). The results confirmed that tryptanthrin exhibited a cell-type independent anti-HCoV-NL63 activity with IC50 values of 1.52 \u03bcM and 0.30 \u03bcM in LCC-MK2 and Calu-3 cells, respectively.",

In the plaque assay, tryptanthrin markedly reduced the production of extracellular virions in these two modes, implying that it significantly blocked virus production at the early and late stages (Figure 7). In addition, tryptanthrin exhibited a higher inhibitory activity against the production of extracellular virions in the late stage (IC50 = 0.05 \u03bcM) than in the early stage (IC50 = 6.99 \u03bcM) (Figure 7A,B, Table 1).",

The RT-qPCR assay revealed that tryptanthrin reduced the number of HCoV-NL63 RNA genomes in the post-infection treatment/removal mode more effectively than in the co-treatment/removal mode (Figure 8). The result indicated that tryptanthrin possibly reduced the transcriptional action of HCoV-NL63 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during viral replication. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of tryptanthrin on the protease activity of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 was further detected using the in vitro trans-cleavage assay (Figure 9). Recombinant HCoV-NL63 PLP2 protein with a His tag was synthesized in E. coli and purified using the immobilized metal affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting assays determined the purity and integrity of recombinant HCoV-NL63 PLP2 protein with a molecular weight of approximately 36 kDa (Figure 9A). Recombinant PLP2 protein exhibited proteolytic activity on the substrate HRP in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 9B). Notably, tryptanthrin exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of recombinant PLP2-mediated trans-cleavage on HRP (Figure 9C,D). The results indicated that the antiviral activity of tryptanthrin against HCoV-NL63 was associated with the inhibitory action on viral RNA genome synthesis and PLP2 activity during the later stage of in vitro replication that was linked with the viral infectivity and virion production.",

For determining the residual infectivity, the 1000-fold dilution of the mixture was used in the plaque assay based on the negligible effects of tryptanthrin on plaque formation. Tryptanthrin exhibited a significant virucidal activity in a concentration-dependent manner at 37 \u00b0C, and the IC50 value of tryptanthrin for virucidal activity was 0.06 \u03bcM (Figure 10A, Table 1). Subsequently, the virucidal activity of indigodole B and S. cusia leaf methanol extract were evaluated (Figure 10B,C). Notably, indigodole B and S. cusia leaf methanol extract exhibited virucidal activity in a concentration-dependent manner for which the IC50 values were 2.09 \u03bcM for indigodole B and 0.12 \u03bcg/mL for S. cusia extract (Figure 10B,C, Table 1). The results indicated that tryptanthrin and indigodole B functioned as critical components eliciting virucidal activity in S. cusia leaf methanol extract. Moreover, the dot-blotting assay using the virus/compound mixture after a 1-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, which was used to examine the effect of tryptanthrin on surface protein integrity of HCoV-NL63, revealed that tryptanthrin altered the antigenic structure of HCoV-NL63 structural proteins (spike and envelope proteins, which were associated with the inactivation of viral infectivity) (Figure 11).",

Notably, tryptanthrin and indigodole B were originally identified as the compounds in the S. cusia leaf methanol extract with highest activity against HCoV-NL63 (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5, Table 1). Tryptanthrin was first reported as the distinct antiviral agent to reduce HCoV-NL63-induced CPE and to drastically inhibit the progeny virus production in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 1.52 \u03bcM) (Figure 4). Indigodole B, recently identified in S. cusia leaf methanol extract [9], is a tryptanthrin derivative conjugated with the ethyl group at C-5a (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin), and exhibited intense antiviral activity with an IC50 of 2.60 \u03bcM against virus yield (Figure 4). Previous studies revealed several active antiviral compounds in the S. cusia extract against Herpes simplex virus-1 (IC50 = 49.3 \u03bcM by lupeol) [4], and influenza A virus (IC50 = 29.2 \u03bcM by strobilanthes A, IC50 = 46.0 \u03bcM by 2(3H)-benzoxazolinone, and IC50 = 31.48\u201371.57 \u03bcg/mL by aurantiamide acetate) [5,6]. Moreover, \u03b2-sitosterol was denoted as the inhibitor of the SARS coronavirus 3C-like protease [15], and exerted marginal inhibitory activity against HCoV-NL63-induced CPE. Therefore, S. cusia contains several active chemical constituents like tryptanthrin and indigodole B against various viruses, such as coronaviruses and influenza viruses.",

            "text": "The antiviral activity of tryptanthrin and indigodole B was first reported in this study (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9, Table 1). Tryptanthrin and indigodole B were less toxic to LCC-MK2 and Calu-3 cells (Table 1). Previous reports showed that tryptanthrin had no significant cytotoxic effect on the survival rates of human normal cells such as human foreskin fibroblasts and mast cells [25,26]. Tryptanthrin exhibited better antiviral activity than its derivative indigodole B (Figure 3 and Figure 4), exhibiting potent anti-HCoV-NL63 activity by virus yield reduction in LLC-MK2 cells (IC50 = 1.52 \u03bcM) and infectivity inhibition in Calu-3 cells (IC50 = 0.30 \u03bcM) (Figure 4 and Figure 5, Table 1). Therefore, tryptanthrin inhibited HCoV-NL63 infectivity in Calu-3 cells at 32 \u00b0C more effectively than that in LLC-MK2 cells at 37 \u00b0C (Figure 4 and Figure 5, Table 1). The results revealed that tryptanthrin functioned as a potent inhibitor with cell-type-independent antiviral activity against HCoV-NL63. Tryptanthrin significantly targeted viral enzymes like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and PLP2 that are involved in the late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, moderating the viral RNA genome synthesis and progeny virus production (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9). Tryptanthrin was first isolated from S. cusia and also extracted from the other indigoferous plants, Persicaria tinctoria and Isatis tinctoria (also known as Isatis indigotica) [27,28,29]. Tryptanthrin has a variety of pharmacological properties, such as antifungal (dermatophytes), antibacterial (Helicobacter pylori), anti-inflammatory, and antitumor (leukemia, breast and colon cancer cells) properties [30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. In addition, tryptanthrin displayed anti-angiogenic effect by improving skin lesions in psoriasis through regulation of ERK1/2 MAPK and PI3K-mediated expression of apelin [37]. Tryptanthrin exhibited anti-neuroinflammatory action by inactivating NF-\u03baB pathway to suppress TLR4-MyD88-mediated inflammation [38]. Additionally, tryptanthrin exerted a hepatoprotective effect on oxidative stress through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in HepG2 cells [39]. Therefore, such pharmacological activities improved the antiviral potential of tryptanthrin against HCoV-NL63 and other viruses.",

            "text": "In addition to its antiviral activity, tryptanthrin demonstrated potent virucidal activity against HCoV-NL63 (IC50\n= 0.06 \u03bcM) (Figure 10A, and Table 1). Additionally, indigodole B and the S. cusia leaf methanol extract exhibited effective virucidal activity against HCoV-NL63, with IC50 values of 2.09 \u03bcM for indigodole B and 0.12 \u03bcg/mL for S. cusia extract (Figure 10B,C, and Table 1). Therefore, tryptanthrin and indigodole B were suggested to be the key components in S. cusia leaf methanol extract that exerted the antiviral and virucidal effects against HCoV-NL63. Since tryptanthrin was one of the critical components in Persicaria tinctoria and Isatis tinctoria (Isatis indigotica), it might play a role in the antiviral properties of the extracts against Influenza A and B, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and pseudorabies virus [11,40,41,42,43]. Notably, Isatis tinctorial extract exhibited virucidal activity against Japanese encephalitis virus and pseudorabies virus. However, tryptanthrin was not identified as the antiviral compound in the Isatis tinctorial extract, possibly owing to the difference in the separation methods. Therefore, more studies are necessary to elucidate the antiviral activity of tryptanthrin against Influenza A and B, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and pseudorabies virus in future studies. ",

            "text": "This study indicates that tryptanthrin was identified as the major active component in S. cusia leaf methanol extract that inhibits HCoV-NL63 replication in a cell-type-independent manner. Interestingly, tryptanthrin serves a higher antiviral activity against HCoV-NL63 than indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) that has an additional ethyl moiety at C5a instead of double bond in tryptanthrin, revealing the double bond in quinazoline ring of tryptanthrin skeleton as the active contributor to prove the antiviral activity. Moreover, tryptanthrin specifically alters the antigenic structure of viral spike proteins and inhibits the cleavage activity of PLP2, as associated with virucidal activity and inhibiting the post-entry stage of HCoV-NL63 replication with IC50 of less than 0.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 spike protein shows a highly conserved sequence and structural similarity to SARS-CoV and COVID-19, linking it with the fact that all these viruses have the ACE2 receptor usage. Thus, tryptanthrin, exhibiting the virucidal action and impeding post-entry replication, might be developed as one of the first hit compounds against human coronaviruses.",
