            "text": "The bovine enteric calicivirus (BECV) Newbury agent-1 (NA1), which is different from bovine norovirus (BNoV), was associated with calf diarrhea in the United Kingdom in 1978 (Woode and Bridger, 1978). Data from electron microscopy, animal cross-protection experiments and solid-phase immune electron microscopy has revealed that NA1 is unrelated to BNoV (Bridger et al., 1984, Dastjerdi et al., 1999, Woode and Bridger, 1978). Recent genomic data has revealed the circulation in cows of the virus strains Bo/Nebraska/80/US (NB) and Bo/Newbury1/76/UK (NA1) (Han et al., 2004, Oliver et al., 2006, Smiley et al., 2002). NB-like BECV is genetically most similar to SaV and Lagovirus, and causes pathological lesions in the small intestine of gnotobiotic calves (Smiley et al., 2002). Furthermore, NB and NA1 formed a distinct clade that is independent of the four recognized genera (Oliver et al., 2006). Since this potentially new genus, which includes NB- and NA1-like unclassified BECVs, has not been named by the International Committee on Viral Taxonomy, the present study used the terms \u201cunclassified BECVs\u201d and \u201cNB- and NA1-like viruses\u201d to designate the strains.",

It has become the method used most widely for gene detection and quantitation (Oka et al., 2006, Yaper et al., 2005). In recent years, real-time RT-PCR has emerged as a highly reproducible and sensitive method for detection and diagnosis of NoVs and SaVs, proving to be more sensitive than methods used previously such as electron microscopy and conventional RT-PCR (Atmar and Estes, 2001, Glass et al., 2000, Trujillo et al., 2006). Various real-time RT-PCR assays have been reported for NoV and SaV detection including TaqMan assays (Chan et al., 2006, Hohne and Schreier, 2004, Jothikumar et al., 2005, Kageyama et al., 2003, Oka et al., 2006, Trujillo et al., 2006, Vainio and Myrmel, 2006) and assays based on the SYBR Green chemistry (Pang et al., 2004, Richards et al., 2004). Although the quantitation of the four Caliciviridae genera including NoV, SaV, Largovirus and Vesivirus has been reported worldwide (Green et al., 2001), there are no reports of real-time RT-PCR assays for the detection and quantitation of unclassified BECV in bovine stool samples.",

Since NoV, SaV and BECV belong to family Caliciviridae, the RdRp gene appears to be highly conserved within the family and is a region of choice in the design of new detection methods. In addition, the new SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay could be used to screen human fecal samples to ascertain further the role of unclassified BECVs in human diarrhea outbreaks, with a particular emphasis on human diarrhea cases from developing countries where cattle-human contact is more common (Park et al., 2006, Smiley et al., 2003).",

In the present study, 118 bovine stool samples were selected from archival diarrheic fecal samples. Fifty-nine tested positive for BECV by both conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR, and the remaining 59 samples tested negative by conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR (Park et al., 2008). Among these 118 diarrheic stool samples, one-step SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR not only detected BECVs in all 59 fecal samples that had tested positive by nested PCR but also detected BECVs in 32 fecal samples that had tested negative by nested PCR. These findings support the above suggestion that SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR. In addition, these observations indicate that the fecal prevalence of the BECVs in calf diarrhea might be higher than that reported previously in Korea (Park et al., 2008).",

Interestingly, 32 fecal samples that tested positive only by SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR contained lower numbers of BECV RNA (1.3 \u00d7 100\u20133.4 \u00d7 104\n copies/\u03bcl). These fecal samples of diarrhea with lower number of BECVs might be coinfected with other enteric pathogens. Indeed, these samples positive for other enteric pathogens including BCoV, BRVA and BVDV (data not shown). Therefore, it is presumed that BECV alone can induce diarrhea in calves or can play a role in accelerating the clinical and pathological presentation of diarrhea in the field calves.",
