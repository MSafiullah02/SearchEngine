In anticipation of many requiring home confinement for family care or quarantined due to viral exposure, at-home PACS access options have been made available, including portable workstation packages that can be delivered to one's home. Although necessary, we have acknowledged that these physical and temporal distancing measures could lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, increasing the risk of burnout and strain on mental health.",

Those requesting and meeting requirements for medical exemption are reassigned to duties that do not require direct patient care (at no salary change). By increasing the number of isolated reading rooms, reading stations at outpatient facilities, and at-home reading stations, our department offers an opportunity for those high-risk members to remain engaged in the interpretation of diagnostic imaging.
