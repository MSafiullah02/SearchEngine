            "text": "The respiratory tract is the site of entry for many pathogens. The first line of defence to prevent colonisation of the respiratory epithelium consists of physical measures, such as the ciliary clearance, as well as antimicrobial substances in the airway secretions. Respiratory epithelial cells produce antimicrobial peptides such as defensins, which form an important part of the innate immune response of the respiratory tract (Diamond et al., 2000, Singh et al., 1998). Defensins are a family of cationic peptides, which are produced by neutrophils, macrophages or epithelial cells and which are divided into \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b8 (theta) defensins according to their structural properties (Ganz, 2003). Human \u03b2-defensins show direct inhibitory activities against viruses such as HIV and influenza virus (Leikina et al., 2005, Quinones-Mateu et al., 2003) as well as bacteria such as E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (Krishnakumari et al., 2006). In addition, \u03b2-defensins have immunostimulatory functions including chemotaxis and activation of antigen-presenting cells (Ganz, 2003). In the canine genome 43 putative \u03b2-defensins have been identified by similarity search (14). Of these, canine \u03b2-defensin 122 (CBD122) has been detected in a range of tissues including the lung and was shown to inhibit the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (Sang et al., 2005). Two further defensins (CBD1 and CBD103) have been found in canine skin, however their antimicrobial properties or their potential presence in the canine respiratory tract have not been investigated. Infectious respiratory disease is the most common health problem of housed dogs. Vaccination frequently does not provide a sufficiently rapid immune response to prevent infection of dogs entering a kennel. Traditionally canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus type 2 and the bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica have been associated with canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) and are included in vaccines against the disease complex (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007, Jacobs et al., 2005). However an ever-increasing number of pathogens including viruses and bacteria has been shown to be present in this disease complex (Chalker et al., 2003a, Chalker et al., 2004, Crawford et al., 2005, Erles et al., 2003). \u03b2-Defensins may offer novel routes for the prevention and treatment of diseases, including CIRD, by acting as antimicrobials, either after topical application or by up-regulation of defensin production in the host cell, and by acting as mediators to stimulate the innate immune response. In addition naturally occurring and artificial cationic peptides may be used as vaccine adjuvants (Charoenvit et al., 2004, Fritz et al., 2004). This study therefore investigated the presence of \u03b2-defensins in the canine respiratory tract and their regulation following microbial challenge and determined the antimicrobial action of CBD103 against the respiratory pathogen B. bronchiseptica.",

            "text": "\u03b2-Defensins are components of the innate immune response which are important in protecting mucosal surfaces such as the respiratory tract from microbial invasion. In humans the presence and regulation of \u03b2-defensins in airway epithelial cells has been studied extensively (Schutte and McCray, 2002, Singh et al., 1998, Tsutsumi-Ishii and Nagaoka, 2003) however only one canine \u03b2-defensin, CBD122, has been shown to be present in the lung (Sang et al., 2005). The present study therefore assessed the presence of four \u03b2-defensins in the canine respiratory tract. Three of these (CBD1, CBD103 and CBD108) were found to be present in canine tracheal samples and in primary tracheal epithelial cells. Treatment of these cells with LPS did not lead to increased \u03b2-defensin production. This is in contrast to studies in other species where \u03b2-defensins have been found to be up-regulated in epithelial cells following incubation with LPS. Levels of the human \u03b2-defensin 2 (hBD2) were increased in vaginal epithelial cells after LPS treatment (Pivarcsi et al., 2005) and production of the bovine tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) was induced by LPS in tracheal epithelial cells (Diamond et al., 2000). The up-regulation is thought to be mediated through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) via the NF-\u03baB pathway (Froy, 2005). In addition treatment of epithelial cells with inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to induce \u03b2-defensin production (Diamond et al., 2000, Harder et al., 2001, Tsutsumi-Ishii and Nagaoka, 2003). The concentration of LPS (10 \u03bcg/ml) used in the present study was based on previous experiments using tracheal organ cultures in which this dose had led to an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (Priestnall et al., 2009). TNF-\u03b1 was indeed up-regulated in CTEC following LPS treatment at both time points tested. Our results therefore indicate that the canine \u03b2-defensins CBD1, CBD103 and CBD108 may not be regulated via TLR-4 in tracheal epithelial cells. It is possible that different signalling pathways are responsible for the activation of these defensins. Additional cell types such as lymphocytes and macrophages that are present in the respiratory tract but absent from cultures of epithelial cells may be necessary to induce defensin production. Studies assessing the effect of supernatants from LPS-stimulated canine macrophages or lymphocytes on canine tracheal cells may allow identifying the pathways involved in regulation of \u03b2-defensins in the respiratory tract of the dog.",

            "text": "Several studies have analysed the effect of viral infection on the production of defensins. Human rhinovirus-16 has been shown to induce hBD2 and hBD3 production in primary bronchial epithelial cells (Proud et al., 2004). As viral replication was essential for this effect it was concluded that the up-regulation was mediated through intracellular double-stranded viral RNA. Expression of human \u03b2-defensins was also increased in respiratory papillomas compared to control tissues (Chong et al., 2006). Sheep \u03b2-defensin 1 was up-regulated in the lung of neonatal lambs following experimental infection with ovine parainfluenza virus type 1 (Grubor et al., 2004) whereas infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus did not significantly increase expression of this defensin (Kawashima et al., 2006). In mice infection with influenza virus led to increased expression of murine \u03b2-defensins in the respiratory tract (Chong et al., 2008). In our study both CRCoV and CPIV failed to induce the expression of canine \u03b2-defensins despite both viruses producing double-stranded RNA intermediates during replication. \u03b2-Defensin levels were instead reduced at some time points. Down-regulation of \u03b2-defensins in the lungs of 2-week-old pigs has recently been reported following experimental infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Sang et al., 2009). It has moreover been shown that CRCoV-infected tracheal organ cultures exhibit decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 compared to control cultures (Priestnall et al., 2009). The mechanism for this apparent down-regulation is not known, however it may involve disruption of signalling through TLR-3. It will be necessary to determine if CRCoV and CPIV infections are able to prevent defensin up-regulation by other mediators. However these mediators remain to be determined for canine defensins.",

In our study CBD108 levels in the skin were low and CBD102 was not detected in any tissue samples tested. CBD102 has previously been reported to be present in the skin although expression was variable (Wingate et al., 2009). The levels of mRNA in some of the tissue samples tested in the present study may have been elevated due to inflammatory processes. The samples were from dogs euthanised due to behavioural problems and the only clinical data available was the absence of clinical respiratory disease. Moreover variable expression may be due to sampling of different areas within one tissue.",

Complex respiratory diseases such as CIRD require novel approaches for prevention and treatment. CBD103 may be a candidate for the development of topical treatments of the upper respiratory tract. A possible drawback however is its salt sensitivity at physiological NaCl concentrations of 150 mM similar to other \u03b2-defensins (Maisetta et al., 2008, Sang et al., 2005). The NaCl concentration in human airway surface fluid has been shown to be below that of serum (Knowles et al., 1997, Smith et al., 1996); however other factors such as presence of proteins may also interfere with the activity of defensins (Maisetta et al., 2008). It therefore remains to be determined if canine \u03b2-defensins are active in conditions found in the upper respiratory tract in vivo. CBD1 and CBD108 were present at lower levels compared to CBD103 and it is not clear if they play a role in the defence of the canine tracheal epithelium. However, CBD1 as well as CBD103 may be important for the innate immune response of the skin.",
