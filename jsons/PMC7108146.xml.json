Exposure to the virus was subsequently confirmed by laboratory evidence of serologic conversion to SARS-CoV, a positive viral culture, and/or positive SARS-CoV detection by real-time PCR. Because we were looking for early prognostic factors, only archival samples collected during the first 2 weeks after onset of fever were studied. A total of 255 archival plasma samples were available (126 were collected during the first week and the remaining 129 were second-week samples). Adverse disease outcome was defined as either ICU admission or death from SARS-CoV infection (1)(19). All plasma samples had been preserved at \u221270 \u00b0C before analysis. Details of disease course, results of biochemical and hematologic investigations, and comorbidity (including history of diabetes, chronic lung diseases, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, cancer, ischemic heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic liver disease) were retrieved from patients\u2019 clinical notes. All patients had been treated according to a standard protocol as detailed elsewhere (4)(20). This study was approved by our institutional and hospital research ethics committee.",

Association between categorical variables was performed with the Fisher exact test. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for adverse disease outcome and determine the adjusted odds ratios of these risk factors. Before performing logistic regression analysis, we normalized the chemokine plasma concentrations by conversion to multiples of the median (MoM). The use of MoM enables future application in other laboratories using different assays for these analytes. To reflect a clinical scenario, we developed 2 logistic regression models for variables that were available at the first week and the second week after fever onset. Specifically, only variables that would be available at the specific time point were entered into the multivariate logistic model to identify independent prognostic features.

In addition, for the first time, we noted that a high IP-10 concentration during the first week of illness was an independent risk factor for adverse outcome. All of these prognostic indicators are readily applicable in the clinical setting and are early markers that can be measured within the first week of illness. On the other hand, second-week chemokine concentrations provided information in addition to that provided by LD activity and neutrophil count obtained at day 12. Persistently increased LD activity after the first week may be the best indicator of poor outcome, which might also be fairly obvious from the clinical status at that moment.",
