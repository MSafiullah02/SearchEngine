The first step is to order a CT scan with contrast looking for necrotic tissue (i.e., areas that do not enhance) or a pancreatic abscess. If you find evidence of either, a CT or ultrasound-guided aspiration should be performed and sent for culture. If infection is present, antibiotics are administered. Infected pancreatic necrosis and pancreatic abscesses require surgical debridement using a step-up approach (sequential additional steps if needed): (1) percutaneous or endoscopic drainage, (2) videoassisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD), and (3) open necrosectomy. These procedures are termed external drainage.",

It results from pancreatic injury such as pancreatitis or trauma, which essentially disrupts a pancreatic duct. The pancreatic enzymatic fluid that leaks out is contained by surrounding fibrotic tissue. Although this most commonly appears in patients with chronic pancreatitis, it can also occur in the weeks following resolution of an acute pancreatitis. Patients often present with vague abdominal pain, elevated serum amylase, and possibly a palpable epigastric mass. The diagnostic test of choice is a CT scan, and most can be managed conservatively. Predictors of failure for conservative management include pseudocysts larger than 6 cm or those that have persisted for more than 6 weeks. Treatment of a symptomatic, non-infected pseudocyst that fails to resolve is usually via internal drainage, by creating a connection between the cyst and the adjacent intestinal organ, usually the stomach (endoscopic cystogastrostomy). External drainage is not recommended as this may create a pancreatico-cutaneous fistula. A pseudocyst can erode into arteries, leading to a pseudoaneurysm and upper GI bleed (managed with angiographic embolization).",

This may be a result of ERCP having a 5% risk of causing pancreatitis, related to over-injection of contrast medium into pancreatic ducts, and due to the fact that the majority of gallstones pass into the duodenum spontaneously. There is evidence to support endoscopic removal of common bile duct stones with ERCP and papillotomy if cholangitis is also present.
