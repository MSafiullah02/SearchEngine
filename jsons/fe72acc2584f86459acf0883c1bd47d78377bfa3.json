SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Results: The number of infected people and deaths would increase by 45% and 567% respectively, given that the government only has implemented traffic control in Wuhan without additional medical professionals. The epidemic of Wuhan (measured by cumulative confirmed cases) was predicted to reach turning point at the end of March and end in later April, 2020. The outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was predicted to end at the end of March and the medical service could be fully back to normal in middle of April. During the epidemic, the number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations decreased by 69.86%, 57.41% and 66.85% in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. After the end of epidemic, medical centers located in these metropolises may face 58,799 (95% CI 48926-67,232) additional hospitalization needs in the first month.",

On February 5, three cabin hospitals and two other makeshift hospitals successively started to treat infected patients. By March 9, 346 medical teams and 42,600 medical professionals have been dispatched from other provinces across the country to combat the epidemic in Hubei province. It is reported that 7512 designated hospitals and related fever clinic are mobilized nationwide [4] . However, the nationwide mobilization of medical resources could severely disturb local routine medical service. According to the 2018 National Report on the Services, Quality and Safety in Medical Care System [5] , currently about 2 million patients each year travel across regions to seek medical care in China, among which 43% of all the cross-regional cases are concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (842 thousand cases in total). These three metropolises play a pivotal role in the healthcare system in China, providing high-quality medical service for patients in China. Notably, over thousands of medical professionals from medical centers in these metropolises have been dispatched to Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province to fight COVID-19 [6] . As the full resumption of normal healthcare services in the metropolises marks the complete restoration of healthcare system in China from the epidemic of COVID-19, providing estimation on the number of affected patients and prediction of restoration of routine medical service is urgently needed to facilitate preparedness of the healthcare system.",

In addition, a new House quarantine module (H) was added to demonstrate the effectiveness of new initiatives, as shown in Fig. 1 (See details in the Supplemental Materials Part 1). In order to estimate the epidemic situation of large medical centers and predict the time to restore the functions of daily medical service, we utilized data from Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou to simulate the development of the epidemic assuming that only human-to-human transmission exists, no special medicine is found at this stage and no major health events happen [10] [11] [12] . In the meantime, special consideration was given to the epidemic situation in Wuhan, as it's the epicenter of epidemic. We constructed a specific model to estimate the impact of community containment and construction of makeshift hospitals on the epidemic situation in Wuhan. The date when the first confirmed case was detected in local government was used as the first day for modeling the local epidemic situation, specifically, Dec 8, 2019 in Wuhan [1] , Jan 13, Jan 12 and Jan 21, 2020 respectively in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou [13] [14] [15] .Furthermore, we adopted a strategy different from that of the previous cumulant-based modeling methods [9] . We counted the daily number of people excluding dead and recovered cases to ensure the independence of the current status of each patient, so as to guarantee the accuracy and interpretability of the SEIR model.",

The short-term trend described by the neural network was consistent with the modified SEIR model. Therefore, the modified SEIR model was further used to predict long-term trends of the epidemic. The modified SEIR model simulated the consequences of several measures, including quarantine, the increment of medical professionals and beds. Wuhan was locked down 46 days after the outbreak of the epidemic, and in the meantime other cities strictly restricted the movement of population and initiated home-based quarantine. As a result, the daily growth of exposed people was significantly controlled and gradually dropped down to 15,000 people, which fundamentally minimize the epidemic risk of COVID-19. According to our analysis, with the timely mobilizing of medical professionals and the expansion of beds capacity, the number of infected cases decreased significantly while the number of recovered cases increased significantly. The recovery rate increased by more than 10% and the death rate decreased by 2.5%. The peak of the epidemic occurred earlier than expected. The modeling results show that if the government simply conducted city-wide quarantine in Wuhan without additional beds and reinforced medical professionals, the total number of infected cases might reach more than 80,000 and the number of deaths might be around 20, 000, which increases by 45% and 567% respectively. The peak of the epidemic in Wuhan might be postponed beyond April (Figs. 3 and 4) . The implementation of traffic restrictions led to better containment of COVID-19 infection in other parts of China. The recovery rate in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou rose steadily to more than 45%, with a death rate lower than 1%. According to the estimation, there will be 480 confirmed cases in Beijing, 360 in Shanghai, and 380 in Guangzhou. Nevertheless, the death rates in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are significantly lower than that of Wuhan (1% vs. 4%), while the recovery rates are comparatively higher (45% vs. 16%), suggesting the dispatch of medical professionals have limited negative impact on the local epidemic control. This finding suggests that the growth of epidemic has been slowing down and is gradually reaching the peak. Based on the deduction results of MLP model, the epidemic of Wuhan may reach its inflection point at the end of this March and come to an end in April. The outbreak in Shanghai (Fig. 5) , Beijing (Fig. 6) and Guangzhou (Fig. 7) will end about 1 month earlier than expected. Given that all medical professionals engaged in the epidemic treatment should be quarantine for 2 weeks, the national healthcare system (except Wuhan) would return to normal in mid-April.",

As Chinese authorities have taken massive anti-epidemic actions, the spread of the virus has been effectively curbed. However, patients' demand for routine medical care is substantially suppressed during the persecuting period of the epidemic, especially for patients with noninfectious chronic diseases. In this study, we constructed a mathematical model to simulate the epidemic situation in Wuhan and other parts in China (represented by Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou). Compared to Wu's study [20] , we conducted multi-model analysis and prediction, with special consideration given to the massive anti-epidemic actions taken by Chinese authorities, such as community containment, large-scale mobilization of medical professionals and rapid expansion of beds capacity. In line with Chen's study, which points to the effectiveness of massive interventions taken by China on the control of COVID-19 epidemic [21] , we estimated that the end of COVID-19 would occur about 1 month earlier, ending The distribution of medical resources in China is relatively imbalanced [5] . For instance, 66% of all the established National Clinical Research Centers are located in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, and there are significant numbers of patients across the country admitted in these institutions each year [22] . The restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical centers is determined by several factors, including the epidemic control in critically infected region (represented by Hubei province), the regional epidemic control, and the recovery of public transportation and population flows nationwide [5] . In the present study, we utilized the network data to model the trend of epidemic containment in Wuhan and those three metropolises, and conducted a model-based analysis to estimate challenges after the restoration of operational capability.",

In this study, we adapted and modified the classic SEIR model based on the characteristics of COVID-19, such as the viral transmission capability, its spatial distribution and route of transmission. We introduced the House quarantine module (H), the rehabilitation coefficient (\u03b2), the quarantine measures variable and the cabin hospital variable. Moreover, the real-time network data was leveraged in this modified SEIR model. The traditional SEIR model is flawed by inaccuracy to predict the inflection point of the epidemic [23] . We used neural network to address this issue. Compared to the traditional time series prediction algorithms, the neural networks process the distributed parallel information by coordinating the interconnection among massive internal nodes [24] . Hence, it is superior in large-scale parallel processing, distributed storage, elastic topology, high redundancy and high robustness, making it more suitable for high-speed non-linear operations. As such, we combined the neural networks with SEIR model, constructing model based on official data to compare the prediction accuracy among four commonly used neural networks and adopted the optimal model for the prediction for the epidemiological trend of COVID-19.",

Amid the severe epidemic, patients' demands for routine healthcare in other specialties are typically suppressed, especially for cross-regional cases. Admittedly, telemedicine among large medical centers may partially relieve the pressure on patients' demand for medical service, whereas the treatment for major diseases, especially invasive surgical treatment, is less available for patients.

As public transportation is being shut down, a large number of patients are having difficulty to access large medical centers, leading to a waste of medical resources among these medical centers. To visualize the impact of this issue, we utilized the Baidu Migration Platform to obtain definitive data of population migration index among Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Based on the ARIMA model, we estimated that the number of cross-regional patients in major medical centers among those three large cities would be reduced by approximately 59 thousand during the first quarter of 2020. The predictions based on this model might be reliable because of its advantage in forecasting time series when compared to the general mathematical models like regression analysis and linear function. According to our analysis, an extra 59 thousand migrant patients would head to the major medical centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, posing a great challenge to the metropolitan healthcare system. Thus, Chinese health authorities should make adequate preparation for triaging patients and their accompanied families. In addition, sufficient attention must be paid to the infected patients with excessively long incubation period and asymptomatic 2019-nCoV carriers [26] . Since 70% of patients are cross-regional cases in tertiary hospitals in Beijing, massive number of migrant patients would raise challenges to local epidemic control during the early stage after the containment of COVID-19. The relevant authorities should develop strategies for health inspection and quarantine. Our results also underscore the importance of a hierarchical healthcare system, which relies on regional medical centers to triage patients.",
