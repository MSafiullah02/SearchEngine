There is some evidence that respiratory infections in early childhood may increase the risk of developing asthma later in life. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by definition, involves structural changes to the airways. However, very little is known about what role virus infections play in the development of this remodelling. This review considers the role of matrix metalloproteases and neutrophil elastase in remodelling, and whether the induction of proteases and other mediators during respiratory virus infections may contribute to the development of airway remodelling. q",

Clinically, it presents as airflow obstruction that is poorly reversible with bronchodilators, and laboratory findings include greater thickness of the airway wall, subepithelial layer and smooth muscle, and hyperplasia of goblet epithelial cells [1, 2] . These structural changes may also contribute to, or worsen, bronchial hyperresponsivness. AR may partly explain why lung function declines more rapidly in asthmatics than non-asthmatics, but AR is difficult to study without invasive or costly imaging procedures [1, 3] . There are conflicting data on reversibility of AR with corticosteroid treatment [2, 4, 5] , with duration and dose of treatment, and duration of disease at the time of starting treatment, impacting on results. Despite a growing consensus that AR is an important component of asthma, and that amelioration of remodelling is an important therapeutic outcome, the molecular basis of this process remains obscure.",

COPD includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive bronchiolitis. While there is much variation in the lung pathology of COPD, typical features are alveolar destruction leading to permanent peripheral airspace enlargement, small airway fibrosis, increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the small airways, reduced lung elasticity, increased mucus production and declining lung function which is poorly reversible with bronchodilators [6] [7] [8] [9] . Contributing factors to this AR include excessive protease activity and free radical damage, followed by induction of growth factors in a presumably aberrant repair process, which may be worsened by polymorphisms in enzymes that metabolize cigarette smoke components [6, 10] .",

Respiratory viruses were detected in 39% [11] , 56% [12] and 64% [13] of patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. Respiratory viruses were detected in 80-85% of school age children with an acute exacerbation of asthma [14] . Amongst adult asthmatics, 76% of patients requiring emergency treatment for acute asthma were infected with a respiratory virus [15] . COPD exacerbations are linked to worsening quality of life [16] and more rapid decline in lung function with more frequent and longer lasting hospital admissions [17] . The typical viruses known to cause exacerbations are rhinoviruses, which cause most common colds, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, coronaviruses and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs). In addition, Hogg [18] has proposed that latent adenovirus infection might also contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. The detection rate and prevalence of specific viruses varies with patient age, time of year, site of sampling, method of detection, influenza vaccination status and that year's predominant influenza strain. In particular, older studies that use culture and/or serology have lower virus detection rates [19] than when PCR is used [11] [12] [13] . While respiratory symptoms are similar during infection with these pathogens, these are distinct viruses with very different replication strategies.",

Virus was undetectable by culture at 12 days post-infection (p.i.) and by real time PCR at 21 days p.i. [24] . Increased numbers of mucus-producing goblet cells and increased staining for the mucin MUC5AC were seen at 21 days p.i., which is similar to the profile of acute fatal asthma in humans [25] . The increased airway hyperreactivity and goblet cell hyperplasia were partly reduced by corticosteroids but unchanged in IFN-g knockout mice. The authors interpreted these overall findings to mean that a single virus infection can lead to permanent changes in the epithelium and airways, and this chronic phenotype in mice can be genetically segregated from the acute antiviral response [24] .",

The movement of cells into the airway lumen was inhibited by treating mice with TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 [37] , and a subsequent histology study showed that the epithelial basement membrane was damaged by transmigration of inflammatory cells [38] . Furthermore, treatment of mice with dexamethasone or TIMP-2 greatly reduced both the transmigration of inflammatory cells and damage to the epithelial basement membrane [38] .",

Possible mediators include TGF-b, platelet-derived growth factor, bFGF, TNF-a and IL-4. Their relevant properties are mitogenic activity for fibroblasts and/or airway smooth muscle cells, and promotion of connective tissue synthesis by these cells [1] . MMPs can directly impact on the activity of growth factors and chemokines, such as TGF-b, TNF-a, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, EGFs, FGFs and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3. Products of MMP activity can act as chemoattractants [21] . Intratracheal instillation of elastase into mice led to a time-dependent release of FGF-2 and TGF-b from the lung into the BAL, and much of the TGF-b was in the active form. In pulmonary fibroblast cultures, elastase treatment caused the release of TGF-b [39] .",

            "text": "Patients with asthma and COPD are often more severely affected by respiratory virus infections than the general population. AR contributes to lung dysfunction in asthma and COPD. While little research has been done in this area, it is possible that lung proteases are a factor in AR. There are many triggers that lead to a net increase in activity of a range of lung proteases, and the possible role of respiratory virus infections in increasing lung protease levels deserves further study.",
