This disease can be fatal. Seniors, and people with other medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease \u2026 ), may be more vulnerable and become seriously ill. This is why research into drugs to treat this infection remains essential in several research laboratories. Natural herbal remedies have long been the main, if not the only, remedy in the oral tradition for treating illnesses. Modern medicine has known its success thanks to traditional medicine, the effectiveness of which derives from medicinal plants. The objective of this study is to determine if the components of natural origin have an anti-viral effect and which can prevent humans from infection by this coronavirus using the most reliable method is molecular docking, which used to find the interaction between studied molecules and the protein, in our case we based on the inhibitor of Coronavirus (nCoV-2019) main protease. The results of molecular docking showed that among 67 molecules of natural origin, three molecules (Crocin, Digitoxigenin, and b-Eudesmol) are proposed as inhibitors against the coronavirus based on the energy types of interaction between these molecules and studied protein.",

China immediately declared the epidemic to the World Health Organization (WHO) and also shared the sequence information with the international community after the discovery of the causative agent. WHO has done its part by coordinating the development of the diagnosis; issue guidelines for patient monitoring, sample collection and treatment; and provide up-to-date information on the epidemic (Munster et al., 2020) . To date, the primary source of infection has been pneumonia patients infected with COVID-19. Transmission of respiratory droplets is the main route of transmission, which can also be transmitted by contact (G. O. of N. H. Committee & Office of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2020). The source of the virus and its ability to spread between people remains unknown, with an increasing number of cases showing signs of human-to-human transmission (Zhu, 2020; Chan et al., 2020) .",

Knowing that the energy value of interaction of the molecule referred (Chloroquine) is (-6 kcal/mol), 11 molecules which have a good interaction with the studied enzyme are mentioned in Table 2 . For example, the Crocin at interaction energy equal to (-8.2 kcal/mol), Digitoxigenin at a value of (-7.2 kcal/mol), and b-Eudesmol at a value of (-7.1 kcal/ mol). The 3 D binding mode of these compounds is shown in Figures 1 and 2. From a biological or pharmacological point of view, these first three molecules which are proposed as inhibitors of Coronavirus main protease are molecules having a significant antiviral power and according to bibliographical research and experiments which have already done, the results found for each molecule of natural origin is as following:",

These interactions are generally spherical with a radius of 4 \u00c5 and cover most of the ligand. So, for the displacement of ligand in the binding site of our enzyme, the first level of interactions was considerate as the most important, the presence of Hydrogen bond interaction in selected complex explains that we have a good interaction between the three molecules and the studied protein (Table 4 , Figure 3 and 4) (Adnan, 2019).

Based on molecular docking, the results is very satisfactory, we have found three molecules among 67 which are very interesting either on the chemical side or on the biological side and therefore we propose these three molecules as inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The synthesis of the these molecules and the evaluation of their in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-Cov-2 main protease could be interesting, before clinical essay. ",
