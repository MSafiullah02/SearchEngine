The highly lethal 20 nature characteristic to CCHFV restricts research to BSL-4 laboratories, which complicates effective 21 research and developmental strategies. In consideration of antiviral therapies, RNA interference can 22 be used to suppress viral replication by targeting viral genes. RNA interference uses small 23 interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence genes. The aim of our study was to design siRNAs that inhibit 24 CCHFV replication and can serve as a basis for further antiviral therapies. A549 cells were infected 25 with CCHFV after transfection with the siRNAs. Following 72 hours, nucleic acid from the 26 supernatant was extracted for Droplet Digital PCR analysis. Among the investigated siRNAs we 27 identified four effective candidates against all three segments of CCHF genome: one for the S and 28 M segments, whilst two for the L segment. Consequently, blocking any segment of CCHFV leads to 29 changes in the virus copy number that indicates an antiviral effect of the siRNAs in vitro. The most 30 active siRNAs were demonstrated a specific inhibitory effect against CCHFV in a dose-dependent 31 manner. In summary, we demonstrated the ability of specific siRNAs to inhibit CCHFV replication 32 in vitro. This promising result can be used in future anti-CCHFV therapy developments.",

Our study is in agreement with previous works [15, 27] that targeting 355 the S segment by siRNAs can produce an effective inhibitory impact. In consequence, using the S 356 segment as the target for silencing virus replication has proven to be an option for future therapeutics. ",

However, 360 the details of specific glycoprotein involvement remain unknown[2]. In contrast with other studies, 361 a high inhibitory effect of siRNA (90%) was found against the M segment.

So far, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that 68 used RNA interference to inhibit CCHFV replication in vitro. Although, another member of the Nairoviridae family (e.g. HAZV) was already researched on virus gene silencing by RNA interference 70 [13]. RNA interference uses small double-stranded RNAs with a complementary sequence to the 72 target silencing genes. Nevertheless, endogenous gene silencing operates through multiple73 mechanisms such as mRNA cleavage, inhibition of translation, and epigenetic modifications of 74 chromatin, of which mRNA cleavage is the most efficient mechanism for antiviral therapies [6]. Small 75 interfering RNAs (siRNA) are the active agents in RNA interference. The siRNAs are 21-22 nucleotides long, serve as a guide for cognate mRNA degradation [17]. Naturally, these siRNAs are 77 a result of endonucleolytic processing of a larger precursor RNA. Experimentally, RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells after the transfection of synthetic siRNA using suitable transfection reagents. These siRNAs are incorporated into a cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) which cleaves exogenous double-strand siRNAs and leaving an unpaired guide strand to search for 81 complementary mRNAs. If the target site on the mRNA has nearly perfect complementarity to the 82 guide siRNA, the mRNA is cut by an Argonaute (Ago) endonuclease in the RISC and is degraded.This way, siRNA is silencing the expression of the protein encoded by the target mRNA. Typically, protein expression is reduced but not eliminated[6].Recent works have shown that more effective antiviral therapies are urgently needed to treat 86 virus infections especially for viruses with growing epidemic potential[9,15]. Furthermore, these RNA interference experiments have shown that the application of siRNAs can inhibit viral infection by targeting viral genes[18,19]. However, many aspects of the CCHFV cell entry, replication and 89 pathogenesis remain poorly defined. It was mostly studied by using minigenome systems or viruslike-particle systems considering its highly infectious nature and the lack of BSL-4 laboratories [2]. In our present study, we aimed to design chemically synthesized siRNAs that can inhibit first time CCHFV replication in vitro.

We evaluated the antiviral activity of siRNAs targeting the S (nucleoprotein), M (glycoproteins) and L (polymerase) transcripts of CCHFV for the first time in vitro. The siRNAs were designed for each CCHFV segment in an effort to find the most effective ones. We observed that among all tested siRNAs, almost half of them (siS2, siS6, siM1, siM6, siL1, siL3, siL4) were capable of reducing CCHFV copy number by more than about 70% during in vitro infection studies, comparing to the positive control. However, strong inhibition of CCHFV replication (by about 90%) was performed by only four siRNAs (siS2, siM1, siL3, and siL4).The unusual ability of many siRNAs inhibits the virus, contrary to previous studies, is due to the342 successful design and the high rate of transfection achieved. In case of the CCHFV S segment protein, nucleoproteins play a central role in the regulation of 344 viral replication. Nucleoprotein associated with genomic viral RNA to form RNPs and provided as a template for the polymerase. In the last few years, several homologous interferences have been 346 described as the inhibition of S segment of other nairoviruses by siRNAs and suppression of viral 347 replication [15,26,27]. Levin et al. found that Akabane virus (AKAV) infected Vero cells indicated 348 more than 99% inhibition [26], whilst, Chiang et al. described siRNA against the S segment of andes 349 virus (ANDV) greatly reduced levels (>60%) of viral protein expression [15]. In case of the hazara 350virus inhibition, the siRNAs which were designed against the S segment had a higher effect (up to 90%) than those targeting M and L segments[27]. Several experiments performed has shown that the 352 S segment of genus Orthobunyavirus is the RNA interference prime target in arthropod cells[29,30].",
