Everything in the New Public Health is about preventing avoidable disease, injuries, disabilities, and death while promoting and maximizing a healthy environment and optimal conditions for current and future generations. Thus, the New Public Health addresses overall health policy, resource allocation, as well as the organization, management, and provision of medical care and of health systems in general within a framework of overall social policy and in a community, state, national, transnational, and global context.",

            "text": "Over the past century there have been many definitions of public health and health for all. Mostly they represent visions and ideals of societal and global aspirations. This chapter examines the very base of the New Public Health, which encompasses the classic issues of public health with recognition of the advances made in health promotion and the management of health care systems as integral components of societal efforts to improve the health of populations and of individuals. What follows in succeeding chapters will address the major concepts leading to modern and comprehensive elements of public health. Inevitably, concepts of public health continue to evolve and to develop both as a philosophy and as a structured discipline. As a professional field, public health requires specialists trained with knowledge and appreciation of its evolution, scientific advances, concepts, and best practices, old and modern. It demands sophisticated professional and managerial skills, the ability to address a problem, reasoning to define the issues, and to advocate, initiate, develop, and implement new and revised programs. It calls for profoundly humanistic values and a sense of responsibility towards protecting and improving the health of communities and every individual. In the twenty-first century, this set of values was well expressed in the Human Development Index agreed to by 160 nations (Box 2.1\n).BOX 2.1Human Development Index 2010\u201cPeople are the real wealth of a nation\u201d. With these words the 1990 Human Development Report (HDR) began a forceful case for a new approach to thinking about development. That the objective of development should be to create an enabling environment for people to enjoy long, healthy and creative lives may appear self-evident today. But that has not always been the case. A central objective of the HDR for the past 20 years has been to emphasize that development is primarily and fundamentally about people.Source: Overview: Human Development Report 2010. 20th anniversary edition.

Growing scientific and epidemiological knowledge increases the capacity to deal with these diseases. Many aspects of public health can only be influenced by the behavior of and risks to the health of individuals. These require interventions that are more complex and relate to societal, environmental, and community standards and expectations as much as to personal lifestyle.

Similar, more recent breakthroughs in medical, epidemiological, biological, and social sciences have produced enormous benefit for humankind as discussed throughout this text, with some examples. These include the eradication of smallpox and in the coming years, poliomyelitis, measles, leprosy, and other dreaded diseases known for millennia; the near-elimination of rheumatic heart disease and peptic ulcers in the industrialized countries; vast reduction in mortality from stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD); and vaccines (against hepatitis B and HPV) for the prevention of cancers.

Monitoring or immunization of domestic animals requires a combination of multidisciplinary zoonotic disease management strategies, public education and awareness, and veterinary public health monitoring and control.

That there should be a spread of life expectancy of 48 years among countries and 20 years or more within countries is not inevitable. A burgeoning volume of research identifies social factors at the root of much of these inequalities in health. Social determinants are relevant to communicable and non-communicable disease alike. Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, The WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health reviewed the evidence, raised societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. A major challenge put forward by the Commission is turning public health knowledge into political action.\"\nBOX 2.5Social Determinants of Health\n\"Social justice is a matter of life and death. It affects the way people live, their consequent chance of illness, and their risk of premature death. We watch in wonder as life expectancy and good health continue to increase in parts of the world and in alarm as they fail to improve in others. A girl born today can expect to live for more than 80 years if she is born in some countries \u2013 but less than 45 years if she is born in others. Within countries there are dramatic differences in health that are closely linked with degrees of social disadvantage. Differences of this magnitude, within and between countries, simply should never happen. These inequities in health, avoidable health inequalities arise because of the circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. The conditions in which people live and die are, in turn, shaped by political, social, and economic forces. Social and economic policies have a determining impact on whether a child can grow and develop to its full potential and live a flourishing life, or whether its life will be blighted. Increasingly the nature of the health problems rich and poor countries have to solve are converging. The development of a society, rich or poor, can be judged by the quality of its population\u2019s health, how fairly health is distributed across the social spectrum, and the degree of protection provided from disadvantage as a result of ill-health.\"\nSource: World Health Organization.

Control of AIDS relies on an array of interventions that promote change in sexual behavior and other contributory risks such as sharing of needles among drug users, screening of blood supply, safe hygienic practices in health care settings, and education of groups at risk such as teenagers, sex workers, migrant workers, and many others. Control of AIDS is also a clinical problem in that patients need antiretroviral therapy (ART), but this becomes a management and policy issue for making these drugs available and at an affordable price for the poor countries most affected. This is an example of the challenge and effectiveness of health promotion and the New Public Health.BOX 2.7The Ottawa Charter: Health PromotionHealth promotion (HP) is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve their health.HP represents a comprehensive social and political process, and not only embraces actions directed at strengthening the skills and capabilities of individuals.HP also undertakes action directed towards changing social, environmental, and economic conditions so as to alleviate their impact on public and individual health.Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over the determinants of health and thereby improve their health. Participation is essential to sustain health promotion action.The Ottawa Charter identifies three basic strategies for health promotion. These are advocacy for health to create the essential conditions for health indicated above; enabling all people to achieve their full health potential; and mediating between the different interests in society in the pursuit of health.These strategies are supported by five priority action areas as outlined in the Ottawa Charter for health promotion:\u2022Build healthy public policy.\u2022Create supportive environments for health.\u2022Strengthen community action for health.\u2022Develop personal skills.\u2022Reorient health services.\nSource: Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion.

Setting food and drug standards and raising taxes on cigarettes and alcohol to reduce their consumption are also part of health promotion. Promoting a healthy lifestyle is a major known obesity-preventive activity. Health promotion is provided by organizations and people with varied professional backgrounds working towards common goals of improvement in the health and quality of individual and community life.

An eminent pioneer in cellular pathology, Rudolph Virchow provided leadership in social medicine powered by the revolutionary movements of 1848, and subsequent social democrat political movements. Their concern focused on harsh living and health conditions among the urban poor working class and neglectful political norms of the time. Social medicine also developed as an academic discipline and advocacy orientation by providing statistical evidence showing, as in various governmental reports in the mid-nineteenth century, that poverty among the working class was associated with short life expectancy and that social conditions were key factors in the health of populations and individuals. This movement provided the basis for departments in medical faculties and public health education throughout the world stressing the close relationship between political priorities and health status. This continued in the twentieth century and in the USA found expression in pioneering work since the 1940s at Montefiore Hospital in New York and with Victor Sidel, founding leader of the community health center movement the USA from the 1960s.",

It is possible to err widely in health planning if one set of factors is overemphasized or underemphasized. Excessive supply of one service diminishes the availability of resources for other needed investments in health. If diseases are not prevented or their sequelae not well managed, patients must use costly health care services and are unable to perform their normal social functions such as learning at school or performing at work. Lack of investment in health promotion and primary prevention creates a larger reliance on institutional care, driving health costs upwards, and restricting flexibility in meeting patients\u2019 needs.

By 2008, nearly 70 percent of households in developing countries consumed adequately iodized salt.

New modalities of treatment are reducing death rates from first time acute myocardial infarctions. Better management of diabetes prevents the early onset of complications.

The Ottawa Charter called on all countries to put health on the agenda of policy makers in all sectors and at all levels, directing them to be aware of the health consequences of their decisions and to accept responsibility for health. Health promotion policy combines diverse but complementary approaches, including legislation, fiscal measures, taxation, and organizational change. It is a coordinated action that leads to health, income, and social policies that foster greater equity. Joint action contributes to ensuring safer and healthier goods and services, healthier public services, and cleaner, more enjoyable environments. Health promotion policies require the identification of obstacles to the adoption of healthy public policies in non-health sectors, and ways of removing them.",
