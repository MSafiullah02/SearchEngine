Human rhinoviruses HRVs , the single most important etiologic agent of common colds, are small viruses composed of an icosahedral protein shell that encapsidates a single, positive RNA strand. Multiplication of HRVs occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. To produce infection, HRVs must first attach to specific cellular receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Ninety percent of HRVs \u017d . immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ICAM-1 , a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes. The resulting molecular models are useful to address questions about receptor recognition, binding specificity, and mechanisms by which ICAM-1 induces virus uncoating. q",

Infectious virions are thought to uncoat through intermediate particles characterized by the loss of VP4 and the externalization of the hydrophobic N-termini of VP1, which in turns makes the capsid hydrophobic.

ICAM-1 fragments have an approximate dumbbell shape in these reconstructions, and are oriented roughly perpendicular to the viral surface, extending to a radius of about 205 A.

Given the elongated shape of the ICAM-1 D1D2 model, ambiguity exists in its correct orientation around the major D1D2 axis. That problem can be solved by comparing EM reconstructions from complexes of HRV16 with ICAM-1 D1D2 fragments with different degrees of glycosylation. The second domain of ICAM-1 has four N-linked carbo-\u017d . hydrates Fig. 1 , three of which have been removed in a genetically engineered version of ICAM-1 D1D2 with \u017d . reduced glycosylation Bella et al., 1998 .

Carbohydrates are intrinsically flexible molecules and can adopt a myriad of different conformations. This inherent disorder results in only the first two or three sugars from each glycosylation site being visible in crystal structures of glycoproteins, including ICAM-1 D1D2. Analogously, the lumps observed in the EM reconstructions only cover these few sugars that are closer to the protein, and therefore more ordered.",

A hydrophobic pocket inside VP1 lies directly beneath the canyon floor. This pocket was shown to be the binding site for certain antiviral compounds that inhibit the \u017d replication of HRVs and related picornaviruses Fox et al., . 1986; Smith et al., 1986 . Experimental evidence has shown that antiviral drugs bound to this hydrophobic pocket ''lock'' the viral particle in a state in which neither \u017d VP4 nor the N-terminus of VP1 can be externalized Lewis . et al., 1998 , thus preventing uncoating. The footprint of ICAM-1 on the surface of HRV14 or HRV16 does not include the area beneath which the hydrophobic pocket is located, but it is immediately contiguous to it. Nevertheless, there is experimental evidence that the presence of antiviral compounds in the hydrophobic pocket affects cell binding for many of the major group HRVs. A two-step mechanism for the binding of ICAM-1 to HRVs can reconcile these conflicting observations. In a first step, complexes between HRVs and ICAM-1 form in a reversible manner, as they can be observed in cryo-EM reconstructions. The second step involves a displacement of the receptor attached to the virus plus a conformational change on the virus surface, resulting in a tighter, higher affinity binding between ICAM-1 and HRVs. This second step could result from conformational changes in VP1 in which the region around the hydrophobic pocket would act \u017d . as a hinge Fig. 5 . Such movement would induce a destabilization in the virus capsid and perhaps the opening of a channel in the five-fold vertex through which externalization of VP4, the N-terminus of VP1, and eventually \u017d . RNA could occur Kolatkar et al., 1999 . In this way, interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs would initiate uncoating of the viral RNA.",

The presence of an antiviral compound in the pocket would impart rigidity to the hinge region and prevent the second step to occur. As a consequence uncoating would be inhibited. Conversely, empty pockets would impart conformational flexibility to the hinge region, and ultimately allow movement of polypeptide chains during the uncoating process. Crystal structures of HRVs show uncharacterized pocket molecules, probably lipidic in nature, filling the hydrophobic pocket in a manner similar to the antiviral \u017d compounds in HRV14 Smith et al., 1986; Kim et al., . 1989; Oliveira et al., 1993 . It has been suggested that pocket-binding antiviral drugs displace such ''pocket factors'', and that competition between pocket factors and \u017d . receptors regulates the viral stability Rossmann, 1994 . For example, ICAM-1 would be able to eject a weakly bound pocket molecule during the second step of the mechanism shown in Fig. 5 , thus emptying the hydropho- Fig. 5 . Scheme of a two-step binding mechanism between ICAM-1 and major group HRVs. The first step, on the left, is observed in the cryo-EM reconstructions of HRV-ICAM-1 fragments. On the right, the second \u017d . hypothesized step involves a conformational change in the virus surface. The five-fold channel may open as both walls and floor of the canyon bind to domain D1 of ICAM-1. The pocket region is postulated as the hinge area, and needs to be empty in order to provide conformational flexibility.",

            "text": "The study of the interaction between major group HRVs and their receptor, ICAM-1, suggests an hypothesis for how ICAM-1 might initiate uncoating of the viral RNA. Initial contact between the virus and receptor occurs mostly through capsid residues in the canyon and four loops at the tip of domain D1 of ICAM-1, at the end distal from the membrane. This interaction appears to have an important electrostatic component. High-affinity binding probably requires a second step in which other areas of the viral surface and the receptor may come into contact. This second step probably weakens the interactions between the capsid protomers and triggers the uncoating mechanism, perhaps through channels opened in the icosahedral fivefold axes. Capsid-binding antiviral compounds can effectively block the uncoating process by imparting rigidity to the viral capsid and preventing the high affinity binding step between ICAM-1 and HRVs. Many details need still to be addressed, and parallels sought with other picornavirus-receptor interactions. Lacking crystallographic resolution images of the virus-receptor complexes, cryo-EM reconstructions assisted with fitting of molecular models of the individual components will prove very valuable to demonstrate precisely how the virus and receptor interact, and to provide clues about the sequence of events that goes from initial cell surface attachment to release of the RNA into the host cell cytoplasm.
