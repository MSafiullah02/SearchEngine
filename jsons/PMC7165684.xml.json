            "text": "Isosporosis is an ubiquitous protozoic infection of dogs all over the world. Three species of canine Isospora (syn. Cystoisopora) have been described, I. canis, I. ohioensis and I. burrowsi, and all three can cause diarrhoea in puppies (Pell\u00e9rdy, 1974). Once the animals have overcome the infection they can develop immunity in varying degrees (Tenter and Deplazes, 2006). The long survival of the oocysts (Eckert et al., 2005) and their high ability to survive disinfection (Barutzki et al., 1981) support the maintenance of infection in canine populations. The parasites cause gross epithelial lesions in the distal parts of the small intestine. Petechiae and ulcerations of various sizes can appear (Pell\u00e9rdy, 1974). Infections without symptoms of diarrhoea have been described, particularly in infections with I. ohioensis (Seeliger, 1999), but serious clinical illness and even death of infected puppies may occur (Daugschies et al., 2000). Seeliger (1999) noted changes in the faecal consistency of all shedding animals together with depression of behaviour in the field. Infections with I. canis were always accompanied with symptoms (Seeliger, 1999). The pathogenicity of I. canis is caused by its development in the deeper layers of the intestinal walls, unlike I. ohioensis which infects the cells of the lamina propria (Dubey, 1978a, 1978b), and in the number of cycles of asexual development \u2013I. canis undergoes three schizogonies (Lepp and Todd, 1974). Studies have demonstrated no differences in dog breeds, but the risk of infection appears to be higher in breeding units or kennels (Gothe and Reichler, 1990). Former studies describe different outcomes of infection. I. ohioensis can cause infections without symptoms (Seeliger, 1999) compared to experimental cases with a mortality of 66% of six infected animals \u2013 the remaining two were treated to avoid death (Daugschies et al., 2000). Clinical signs after experimental infections with I. canis, like increased body temperature, apathia and kachexia, were much more distinctive than after I. ohioensis infections (Becker et al., 1981). The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, infection dynamics and clinical outcome of Isospora infections of puppies under field and experimental conditions and possible means of control.",

Species differentiation was done according to oocyst size as described (Tenter and Deplazes, 2006). Isospora ohioensis and I. burrowsi (i. e.

            "text": "\nIsospora infections are common in puppies and young dogs, and as expected the parasites were frequently diagnosed both in the retrospective evaluation of diagnostic samples and in the investigated dog breeding unit. As described previously, the prevalences in dog breeding units reach 80% and more with high excretion intensities (Gothe and Reichler, 1990; Penzhorn et al., 1992; Bode, 1999). Infections are usually acquired during the suckling period (Hinaidy, 1991), although we could not determine an exact pattern of parasite acquisition in the field, as excretion was already present in the youngest age group (third wol) and could still be found in puppies shortly before weaning. Intensities appeared to peak around the seventh wol. Although indirect parasite transmission via paratenic hosts such as rodents is described (Dubey, 1975) oocysts from the environment must be considered as the primary source of infections in suckling puppies. The dimension of spreading is influenced by seasonal effects and management conditions (Bode, 1999). Little is known about age\u2010related pathogenicity of canine coccidia, and reports on clinical outcome of infections range from asymptomatic (mainly in field infections with I. ohioensis) or symptoms like reduced weight gain and diarrhoea or even death, which have been associated with I. canis infections (Becker et al., 1981; Seeliger, 1999; Daugschies et al., 2000). A high incidence of diarrhoea in infected animals was recorded in the diagnostic samples from our Institute, but there may have been a strong bias towards the submission of samples from clinically ill patients for differential diagnosis. Generally, animals with enteric parasites showed significantly higher prevalences of NHD and HD in comparison to negative ones, but Isospora\u2010infected dogs had more NHD and HD than other animals, whether these were infected with other intestinal parasites or not, indicating a strong correlation between coccidiosis and diarrhoea.",

In contrast to previous reports the clinical signs of infection were limited irrespective of the infection dose or species. Only mild diarrhoea was found as a sign of pathophysiological changes in the gut during the pre\u2010patent stage of infection. There was a negative correlation between infection dose and weight gain from the infection week (third wol) to the fourth wol indicating a negative influence of parasite infection on intestinal absorption; however, the general stagnation of weight gain during that period was probably caused by nutritional factors, e.g. changes from milk to more solid food. It can be speculated that either different isolates may vary greatly in virulence or that other pathogens must also be held responsible for the pathological and clinical changes during coccidiosis. Like other coccidial infections Isospora causes massive desquamation of the tips of the villi and cells of lamina propria of the small intestine (Dubey, 1978a, 1978b) which can lead to clinical signs such as malnutrition and diarrhoea.",

Diarrhoea or loose faeces were significantly reduced in treated animals. After treatment in the patent stage of infection excretion was reduced but not completely prevented (two of five animals continued to shed low numbers of parasites for 3 and 6 days, respectively), while an early application of the drug (before the onset of oocyst shedding) reduced excretion to single days (group B), and this may indicate that those samples probably represented passing oocysts ingested from infected but untreated litter mates in the randomized experimental setup rather than infection, as excretion usually lasted longer than 1 day in untreated animals. The coccidiocidal mode of action and efficacy of STT against all intracellular developmental stages of coccidia prevents the completion of the life cycle and consequently the shedding of oocysts. However, if treatment is carried out after the onset of oocyst excretion in the faeces the effect on the intracellular stages is masked by this excretion. In any case, early treatment provides the maximum control of the parasite. In the high dose group (C) excretion was not seen at all.",
