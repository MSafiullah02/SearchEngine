Because the intrathoracic trachea normally narrows during expiration, obstruction of the intrathoracic trachea, such as that due to extrinsic compression of vascular ring or intraluminal obstruction of foreign body, inflammation, or tracheomalacia, causes a loud noise, acoustically like stridor, heard during both phases of respiration but is more pronounced on expiration. Extrathoracic obstruction (inspiratory stridor) is associated with prolonged inspiration and underaeration of the chest, whereas intrathoracic obstruction (expiratory stridor or wheezing) is associated with prolonged expiration and overinflated chest. Stridor can be associated with mild tachypnea, but a respiratory rate >50 breaths/minute should not be ascribed to upper-airway obstruction alone.",

Bacterial tracheitis is usually a complication of viral laryngotracheitis (with concordant peak age and season) but can occur at any age or as a complication of oropharyngeal surgery.43\nStaphylococcus aureus is the most common cause, followed by Streptococcus pyogenes; the role of anaerobic bacteria is less clear.41, 43 With the universal use of H. influenzae b vaccine, epiglottitis is a rare cause of stridor; current cases of supraglottitis are more likely to affect the aryepiglottic region and to be caused by streptococci. Parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal infections in young children must also be considered; their incidence is increasing42, 44, 45 (see Chapter 28, Infections Related to the Upper and Middle Airways).",

Tachypnea is thought to be the best clinical predictor of lower respiratory tract infection in children. The World Health Organization defines pneumonia primarily as cough or difficult breathing and tachypnea, which definition is age-related: respiratory rate (RR) in breaths/minute >60 in infants 0\u20132 months of age, >50 in infants 2 to 12 months, >40 in children 1 to 5 years, and >20 in children >5 years of age.59 Tachypnea has sensitivity of 50% to 85% for diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection with specificity of 70% to 97%.60, 61 The younger the patient under 24 months of age, the less likely that pneumonia is present if tachypnea is absent. In one study, for infants younger than 2 months, respiratory rate of 60 breaths/minute, retractions, or nasal flaring had sensitivity for diagnosis of pneumonia of 91%.61 Tachypnea also can be a response to fever, dehydration, or metabolic acidosis. In a study from a U.S. emergency department of children younger than 5 years of age who were undergoing chest radiography for possible pneumonia, respiratory rates in those with and without documented pneumonia did not differ significantly. However, 20% of those with WHO-defined tachypnea had pneumonia confirmed compared with 12% in those who did not.62 Performance of a chest radiograph in febrile infants without an apparent focus of infection to exclude pneumonia \u201cmissed\u201d by physical examination has low yield in the absence of tachypnea.63, 64 Cough is a more sensitive but nonspecific symptom of pneumonia. Other symptoms and signs associated with pneumonia, such as nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and cyanosis, have less sensitivity (25%, 9%, and 9%, respectively) but high specificity (87%, 93%, and 94%, respectively).60 Although fever, cough, and tachypnea are cardinal features, any or all of them can be overshadowed or overlooked in patients who come to medical attention for pneumonia-associated stiff neck, abdominal pain, or chest pain or for nonspecific symptoms of illness, such as feeding difficulty in infants. While chest radiograph is not necessary routinely in children with any of these complaints, it should be considered if the patient has fever and cough or tachypnea.65, 66 Classic symptoms of pneumonia reported in adolescents and adults are fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and cough productive of purulent sputum, with less noticeable tachypnea.67\n",

Except in the first few days of life, when pneumonia is due predominantly to bacteria acquired from the mother's genital tract or to organisms acquired transplacentally, nonbacterial pathogens are overwhelmingly predominant.68 As perinatally acquired agents persist, community exposures increase, and maternally derived antibody protection wanes, the infant between 3 weeks and 3 months old is vulnerable to a unique array of lower respiratory tract pathogens.71 Clinical setting, specific symptom complex, and severity of illness in proportion to findings on physical examination aid distinction of likely causes and guide the diagnostic and therapeutic approach (see Table 21-8). Although the pathogens listed in Table 21-8 frequently are referred to as causing \u201cafebrile pneumonia,\u201d this is a misnomer, because Bordetella pertussis infrequently causes lower respiratory tract abnormalities, and respiratory syncytial virus and especially other respiratory viruses frequently cause fever.11, 68, 72, 73 A causal role for Ureaplasma urealyticum is not completely defined, because the situation is confounded by the asymptomatic presence of this organism in women and young infants.

Chest radiography and laboratory tests usually are reserved for patients who are ill and hospitalized or whose clinical picture is not compelling for a category of etiologic agents. A number of studies using complex diagnostic methodologies have confirmed the specific cause of pneumonia in 45% to 85% of cases.72, 73, 74, 75, 76 Viral etiologies predominate, and, currently, most are amenable to diagnosis.72 The efficacy trial and postmarketing studies of PCV7 infers Streptococcus pneumoniae as a relatively common cause of pneumonia with patchy or consolidative infiltrates.77, 78 Urine antigen detection test in children with lobar pneumonia also supports the important role of S. pneumoniae;\n79 however, the test is positive in >15% of children with asymptomatic colonization.80 Testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae using IgM enzyme immunoassay serologic test is problematic because of false-positive tests, and may be best utilized in school-aged children and adolescents with findings consistent with mycoplasma infection in those whose pretest probability is moderate or higher.58, 81 Currently, ascribing a causal role of pneumonia to Chlamydophila pneumoniae is confounded by the findings of prolonged asymptomatic carriage and inconsistent serologic results among studies.82\n",
