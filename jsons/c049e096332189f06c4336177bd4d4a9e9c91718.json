These data are supported by other recent studies demonstrating that virus infections are associated with more severe exacerbations of asthma requiring hospital admission in both adults and children [3] and also in asthma mortality where winter peaks of asthma deaths in adults suggest a viral aetiology [4] . These studies and many previous studies on the same subject (reviewed by Pattemore et al. [5] ) have over recent years stimulated a great\"deal of research to elucidate the mechanisms by which upper respiratory virus infections induce exacerbations of asthma.",

The use of experimental infections, however, allows a more invasive approach to be taken, which in recent years has included bronchoscopy with bronchial lavage and biopsy. These studies have demonstrated that an experimental rhinovirus cold in both normal and asthmatic subjects is associated with a bronchial mucosal CDS\"^, CD4'' and CDS'\" lymphocyte infiltrate, as well as eosinophiha, which in asthmatic subjects was persistent [6] . The addition of allergen challenge to experimental infection results in conversion of early asthmatic reactors to late asthmatic reactors [7] , with increased bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia and histamine levels [8] .",

Of the rhinovirus-inoculated subjects, eight developed severe colds and the other 11 developed mild colds. There was no significant change in pulmonary function in either group, though there was a trend in both severe and mild groups for a decrease in FEV| of about 5% on the third day after inoculation. There were significant increases in bronchial hyperreactivity in both groups and increases in nasal lavage IL-8 levels on day 2 and day 9. In accordance with previous observations there was also a peripheral blood lymphopenia and neutrophilia. Correlations were observed between the increase in IL-8 level at day 2 and the severity of cold symptoms, the change in PC20 and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. The authors concluded that the severity of a cold induced by experimental rhinovirus infection is related to the increase in airway hypersensitivity to histamine and that release of chemokines such as IL-8 may play a role in this process.",

First is that the method of virus inoculation differed from previous similar studies in that subjects received not only nasal spray and nasal drops as is commonplace but also inhalation via the nasal passages of a nebulized solution of virus. The total dose of virus given was similar to that in previous studies but the changes in histamine reactivity and also the fact that an exacerbation of asthma was induced in the one subject with the most reactive airways suggest that this model may be getting somewhat closer to virus-induced exacerbations of asthma in real life.",

Clearly the danger is that one does not wish to induce real life exacerbations of asthma in such studies but a demonstrable decrease in airway function and an increase in asthma symptoms is clearly desirable. The authors have achieved a non-significant trend in the former case and a significant increase in asthma symptoms in the latter. I would recommend that any future studies wishing to investigate the mechanisms of virus-induced asthma should employ similar methods to those used in this study. It may be profitable in future studies to monitor small airway function rather than simply PEF or FEV, which are rather crude measures of large airway function.",

There is now little doubt that bronchial hyperreactivity can be reliably induced by both experimental and wild type virus infections in atopic and asthmatic subjects, though the role of bronchial hyperreactivity in relation to asthma itself is more complex [11] . Bronchial hyperreactivity can also be induced in normal subjects, though less reliably and of lesser severity [12] . The role of cytokine release in virus-induced asthma has been a subject of much study recently and a wide variety of cytokines including IL-li3, IL-6 [13] , IL-8 [14] , IL-11 [15] , TNF\u00ab [13] , interferon-a and -7 [13] , RANTES and MlPl-a [16] have been found in association with viral infection.",

This study goes a little way towards achieving that end in demonstrating that the amount of IL-8 induced by the experimental colds correlates not only with cold and asthma symptoms, but also with the changes in PC20 and in peripheral blood cell counts. These data are in accordance with our own observations, which have demonstrated increased IL-8 levels in wild type virus infections during exacerbations of asthma in school children (the majority of these infections were rhinovirus infections [14] ). There were also increased levels of the neutrophil product myeloperoxidase, a correlation between the levels of myeloperoxidase and the severity of nasal symptoms, and the IL-8 purified from these samples was biologically active in neutrophil chemotaxis assays, suggesting that IL-8 was playing an active role in recruiting and activating neutrophiis [14] .",
