About 70% of bats are insectivores and most of the rest are frugivores. A few species feed on animals other than insects, one example being the hematophagous vampire bats. Bats are present throughout the world and play vital ecological roles in many ecosystems. Although much is known about the ecology and physiology of bats, they are also among the less studied mammals with regard to immunology [2]. Currently, more than 100 viruses have been isolated from bats [3]. Bats have been shown to be involved in several emergent viral diseases caused by coronaviruses, flaviviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses, henipaviruses, filoviruses and lyssaviruses [4].",

All dead bats found in human environments as well as sick and suspicious bats with no human contact were submitted for rabies testing at ANSES's Nancy laboratory. The data included the diagnostic results, information on the location where the bat was isolated, date of submission, morphological identification of the bat [17] and the name of the collector (local veterinary services or bat handler from the French national bat conservation network).

In 2012, BBLV was reported for the first time in Myotis nattereri in France thanks to effective collaboration with bat workers [8]. Our study showed, in conjunction with the increase of bat submissions, a high proportion of pipistrelles (\u224840%), one of the most abundant bat species in France and also in southern Europe, over the period 2001\u20132013. All 1176 submitted pipistrelles were diagnosed negative for the presence of rabies, as previously reported in the Netherlands [31]. P. pipistrellus, which shows strong synanthropic behaviour, might be less exposed to lyssavirus [32]. Our results, in association with the philopatric behavior of this bat species could indicate, as previously suggested, that the risk of P. pistrellus infection with a Lyssavirus is almost non-existent [32] although its cohabitation with serotines is well known (Christine Harbusch, personal communication). The other bat species (Plecotus auritus, Nyctalus noctula) occasionally found to be infected with EBLV-1 were also found negative in our study, demonstrating that these tree-dwelling bats are also rarely infected with EBLV-1.",

Furthermore, high fluctuations in the numbers of bat submissions were observed between geographical areas. For example, in the centre of France, in an area of approximately 39,151 km2 [the total area of France is 552,000 km2], 7 serotine bats were found to be infected out of a total of 21 tested serotines and out of 48 positive cases. Up to now, 140 colonies of serotine bats have been reported in this region out of a total of 987 colonies housing other species [34]. While serotines are shown to be distributed throughout the country [35] and while some aspects of serotine bat ecology have been studied, including diet, habitat use, foraging and roosting behaviour, others are mostly unknown, especially its hibernation ecology, mating system, dispersal and population structure. An understanding of the spatial ecology, behaviour and social dynamics of serotine bat populations is essential for a better understanding of EBLV-1 prevalence patterns in bat colonies.",

This seasonality has recognized importance for epizootiological processes [38]. The infection status of bats has already been shown to be affected by season for some viruses, including lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, coronoviruses and filoviruses [2]. Using passive surveillance data, we report for the first time in Europe the seasonality of the rabies incidence rate in bats, with a higher rabies incidence detected in autumn (September to November) reaching 34%. In our study, 81% ( = 38/47) of positive cases were detected between June and October. The highest probability of detecting a rabies case among submitted bats in autumn rather in summer could be explained by the natural dispersal of serotine bats which promotes the contact rates between males/females, adults/juveniles and between infected and susceptible animals. Dispersal is a poorly understood event in the serotine bat species, as is the mating period and the ecology of males. No adult males are found within maternity roosts, indicating exclusion once they reach sexual maturity [39]. The mating period, taking place in late summer/early autumn (August-October), could also promote the diffusion of EBLV-1 in bats.",

            "text": "As previously suggested [37], the interaction of the incubation period with hibernation and the annual birth pulse, which starts for serotines in early June but which depends on the climate, can generate complex dynamics for the rabies virus. To date, current knowledge about rabies in serotines in Europe is limited. Little is known about the virulence, dissemination or transmission of the virus among free-living insectivorous bats, or abouts the incubation period of European bat lyssaviruses. Although the incubation period is not known for bats naturally infected with EBLV-1, experimental EBLV-1 studies of E. serotinus and E. fuscus with an inoculation dose of 103.2 LD50/ml showed that the incubation periods varied depending on the route of inoculation, and were respectively between 7 to 26 days and 9 and 58 days [40], [41]. By comparison, the duration of rabies incubation is also highly variable in bats naturally infected with classical rabies virus, ranging from less than 14 days to over 290 days, and can rarely be greater than a year [42], [43]. These variable incubation periods could also explain the temporal dynamics of rabies incidence in our study. Indeed, several previous studies have shown a higher seroprevalence in summer. Seasonal variation in European bat infection was observed through the analysis of a large blood sample panel in Spanish bats showing a significantly higher seroprevalence of EBLV-1 in the summer, at which time maternity colonies are present in most of the bat colonies [32]. This seasonal variability was also shown in Brazilian free-tailed bats in natural cave roosts [44], indicating that roosting ecology and reproductive activity could favor bat infection. This higher seroprevalence in summer reflecting higher rabies exposure could, depending on the incubation period, lead to a higher rabies mortality rate following RV exposure in the subsequent months, and mainly in autumn. The higher seroprevalence reported in summer could also be the result of the higher metabolism of serotine bats in summer than in winter and spring.",

To date, despite the strengthening of passive surveillance, neither EBLV-2 nor WCBV have been isolated in France although EBLV-2 was isolated in three neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. (Reviewed by [45]). Two bat species were shown to be infected by EBLV-2, Daubenton's bat (M. daubentonii) and the pond bat (M. dasycneme). Of the two species, M. dasycneme is reported in the north-west of France, while Daubenton's bat is present throughout France. The absence of EBLV-2 reporting in France has yet to be explained. The number of submissions of M. daubentonii should be increased to provide more elements on the true epidemiological situation of EBLV-2 in France. The real absence of this virus species needs to be proven in the country.",

However, most bats are able to coexist with viruses and may have evolved mechanisms to control viral replication [2]. It is clear that bats can experience either a lethal or non-lethal rabies virus infection, with in the latter case the development of specific neutralising antibodies [46]. We previously reported the presence of EBLV-1 neutralising antibodies in six indigenous bat species throughout France, mainly in E. serotinus and M. myotis, suggesting previous infection with the EBLV-1 rabies virus [47]. However, no EBLV-1 RNA was detected in the RT-PCRs performed on oropharyngeal swabs collected from these six apparently healthy bats [47]. Similarly, a high percentage of seropositive bat species (65%) was recently found in Spain, suggesting that most species of bats are exposed to EBLV-1 [32].",

Serotines infected with the EBLV-1a variant exhibited an east-west distribution from Russia to France with very little genetic variation [10]. Most cases of EBLV-1a were reported in France, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark and Poland. EBLV-1b, which presents far more genetic diversity and a south-north distribution, was mainly reported in Spain, France, Germany, Poland and in the Netherlands [13]. Our study demonstrated that all French EBLV-1 strains belong to the two lineages, a and b, of EBLV-1. Serotines infected with EBLV-1a clustered geographically in the south-west of France while serotines infected by EBLV-1b appeared to be grouped in the centre of France, the north-west and the north-east. Surprisingly, serotines infected by EBLV-1a were geographically separated from the regions displaying EBLV-1b cases. This question of geographic separation has not yet been explained. One hypothesis is that serotines might be a paraphyletic group composed of differentiated lineages at species level, like the Natterer's bat [48], one species being specific to lineage a and the other species specific to lineage b.",

French passive bat rabies surveillance in particular should be improved with regard to targeted bat species such as serotines, Natterer's bats and Daubenton's bats. These results, complemented by active surveillance data [47], will help clarify the dynamics of EBLV-1 transmission and improve understanding of the cross-species infection process. To date, two cases of natural transmission of EBLV-1 to domestic cats have been reported in France [49], demonstrating that the two subtypes, a and b, of EBLV-1 are able to cross the species barrier. This clearly implies that bat biologists, virologists, and public health and agricultural service officials must work together closely in order to protect the public and promote bat conservation.",
