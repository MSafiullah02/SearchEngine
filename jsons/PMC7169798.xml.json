During 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV was recognized in the Middle East region.\n12\n Finally, in December 2019 a novel CoV (2019\u2010nCoV), later named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, was associated with severe lung disease in a cluster of patients in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China, and consequently reported to the World Health Organization.\n1\n Since the lung disease has been designated as CoV disease 2019 (COVID\u201019).\n13\n Interestingly, all currently recognized high pathogenic CoVs in humans appear to have spilled over from bats or other wildlife sources.\n14\n Therefore, concerns for further interspecies transmissions of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from humans to other species may be justified.",

As outlined, pigs have their own range of CoVs and humans have their own range of CoVs with no apparent overlap. It is however interesting to note that CoVs in humans mainly target the respiratory tract whereas CoVs in pigs mainly target the enteric system (Table 1). In pigs, there is only a single CoV associated with respiratory infections, PRCV, commonly resulting in mild disease and lesions\n22\n, \n23\n and hence not considered of importance to pork producers. Prevention in the form of vaccines is not in place for PRCV.",

During a survey involving six domestic animal species including pigs and 242 individual animals in China, SARS\u2010CoV RNA was detected in a single pig.\n24\n Furthermore, two pigs among the 242 animals surveyed were SARS\u2010CoV antibody positive. The authors concluded that SARS\u2010CoV interspecies transmission events occur and possibly pose a risk to humans.\n24\n In another study, 6\u2010week\u2010old pigs and chickens were experimentally infected with SARS\u2010CoV using intravenous, intranasal, ocular, and oral routes.\n25\n None of the animals developed clinical signs or lesions. Virus isolation was unsuccessful; RNA was detected in blood from pigs and chickens and virus\u2010neutralizing antibodies were detected in two pigs. The authors concluded that chickens and pigs likely do not play a role in virus amplification.\n25\n Recognized natural hosts of MERS\u2010CoV include dromedaries and camels.\n26\n, \n27\n To further investigate the potential of other species to amplify MERS\u2010CoV, llamas, pigs, sheep, and horses were experimentally infected.\n28\n Specifically, these species received MERS\u2010CoV intranasally using a mucosal atomization device. Nasal and rectal swabs were collected over time, and MERS\u2010CoV RNA and antigen and virus could be detected in nasal swabs from llamas and pigs. The authors concluded that MERS\u2010CoV circulation in animals other than dromedaries, such as llamas and pigs, is not negligible.\n28\n\n",

Notably, it was reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could use angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from four animal species including porcine ACE2 as the receptor to enter the cell in vitro,\n29\n possibly suggesting that pigs may be susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.",

A dog from Tai Hang, Islands District, Hong Kong, living in the same household as a confirmed COVID\u201019 patient was found SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RT\u2010PCR positive on nasal swab and oral samples without showing any clinical signs beginning of February 2020 (Source: https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport%26reportid=33455). While most pets often have close very contact to their owner, the situation with pigs is different. In China, the origin of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, where most infections in humans have been reported as of now, pig caretakers must be free of signs for COVID\u201019 before being allowed to enter pig farms, as one part of the national large\u2010scale quarantine policy (Source: https://necsi.edu/the-effect-of-travel-restrictions-on-the-domestic-spread-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov). Furthermore, viral spillovers from one species into another species are further promoted by high mutation rates allowing the virus to overcome host\u2010specific defenses. From sequences currently available on SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the mutation rate does not appear to be high (Source: https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/sars-like-cov). Based on today's knowledge, the risk of acquiring a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection while undergoing a transplantation procedure using porcine\u2010derived materials should be considered low but likely needs to be properly assessed. Until this is the case, donor pigs can simply be tested by PCR for the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viral RNA or once available by serology for antibodies to further rule out any infection. This practice is currently already in place for human blood donors in Wuhan and Hubei Province in China.\n30\n\n",
