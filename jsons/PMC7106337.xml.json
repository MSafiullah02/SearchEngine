In mice, it has been revealed that Tex can also serve as antigen delivery systems and can prevent autologous tumor development in a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell\u2013dependent manner.3,6 However, the isolation of autologous Tex may require the in vitro culture of primary tumor cells derived from cancer patients, which may be inconvenient in clinical trials. The findings by Andre et al. suggest that exosomes can be isolated from malignant effusions of melanoma patients and can deliver melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (Mart-1) and tumor antigens to DC for cross presentation to specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).16 Most recently, the exosomes derived from malignant effusions of cancer patients have also been prepared and are ready for clinical trial.17,18,19 Thus, Aex may be used as cell-free tumor vaccine in the immunotherapy of cancer.",

Forty patients (seventeen females and twenty-three males), who had assessable advanced CRC (pathologically diagnosed as stage III or IV as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer) and matched all the criteria (e.g., HLA-A*0201+CEA+ and malignant effusions), were enrolled in this trial. These patients were randomly assigned to treatments with autologous Aex alone (groups A\u2013D, corresponding to 100, 200, 300, and 500 \u03bcg doses, respectively) or Alex (groups E\u2013H, corresponding to 100, 200, 300, and 500 \u03bcg doses, respectively) plus 50 \u03bcg GM-CSF (Table 1\n). The mean age of all patients was 52.7 years. The mean age of all eight groups was as follows: group A, 52.8 years; group B, 51.4 years; group C, 52.8 years; group D, 53.0 years; group E, 50.2 years; group F, 54.2 years; group G, 55.6 years; group H, 51.8 years. Thirty-seven patients completed four vaccinations at weekly intervals. Three patients left the treatment, among whom two patients (A2 and H1) had progressive disease and one patient (C5) had serious adverse events unrelated to the vaccine (Table 1). During the treatment schedule, all the adverse events were recorded after the first vaccination. Also the antitumor immune responses were evaluated 2 weeks after the last vaccination.",

We found that the isolated Aex were universal membrane vesicles with the diameter \u223c60\u2013100 nm (Figure 1a\n). Western blotting analysis demonstrated that Aex were enriched in MHC molecules (MHC-I and MHC-II), HSPs (including HSC70, HSP70, and HSP90), CD80, ICAM-1, CD71, and LAMP-3 (Figure 1b). Notably, the typical CEA of CRC was also detected in the Aex. Because the capacity of exosomes in stimulating antitumor immune responses is largely dependent on the levels of MHC molecules and HSPs,3,4 we examined the expression of MHC-I and HSC70 as quality control standards for all the Aex preparations. Most of the prepared autologous Aex contained high levels of MHC-I and HSC70 (Figure 1c). These results (morphology, density, and protein components) suggested that the Aex prepared by us were exosomes.",

Therefore, we went further to examine whether the immunotherapies with Aex or Aex plus GM-CSF induced systemic antigen-specific antitumor immunity both in vitro and in vivo. First we performed the antigen recall experiments by examining the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in CRC patients 2 weeks after the last immunization. We found that Aex immunization at a dose of 300 or 500 \u03bcg could efficiently induce DTH responses [100% in groups C (4/4), D (5/5), G (5/5), and H (4/4)] in the presence or absence of GM-CSF adjuvants (Table 3\n). However, when lower doses of Aex (200 \u03bcg per immunization) were used, GM-CSF could significantly increase the efficiency of Aex in the induction of DTH, as evidenced by the differences between the DTH response rate of group B (1/5, 20%) and that of group F (3/5, 60%) (Table 3). When a dose of 100 \u03bcg of Aex was used, poor DTH responses were recorded [25% (1/4) in group A versus 20% (1/5) in group E] (Table 3). The detection of DTH responses suggested that Aex could potentially induce systemic antitumor responses in vivo.",

The HLA-A*0201-restricted CEA peptide CAP-1 (YLSGANLNL) and the irrelevant HLA-A*0201-restricted coronavirus SARS-CoV spike protein peptide SSp-1 (RLNEVAKNL) were used in these assays. For the evaluation of the tetramer tests, we established a ratio of percentages (of CD8+tetramer+ cells specific to CAP-1 to that specific to SSp-1) of more than twofold as a positive one. We found that Aex alone at all the doses (100\u2013500 \u03bcg) could not efficiently induce HLA-A*0201-restricted and CAP-1-specific CTL production (2 of the 10 tested patients are positive) while the GM-CSF combination could significantly (20% in the Aex group versus 76.9% in the Aex plus GM-CSF group, P < 0.01) promote the CTL production (10 of the 13 tested patients are positive) (Table 3). For the examination of CTL toxicity against CRC, we used SW480 cells (HLA-A2+CEA+) or LoVo cells (HLA-A2\u2013CEA+) as targets, and we established a ratio of the percentage of specific lysis against SW480 to that against LoVo, when more than twofold as a positive one. We found that the Aex alone or the Aex plus GM-CSF treatments could both efficiently induce the Aex-specific CTL toxicity (Table 3). However, the GM-CSF could promote the induction of CTL cytotoxicity by Aex (Figure 2b\nand Table 3). For the evaluation of CAP-1-specific IFN-\u03b3 release, we used CAP-1-pulsed T2 cells as stimulators and SSp-1-pulsed T2 cells as negative control. We found that the Aex alone or the Aex plus GM-CSF treatments could both efficiently induce the CEA (CAP-1 peptide)-specific IFN-\u03b3 release of CD8+ T lymphocytes (Figure 2c and Table 3). Therefore, generally the GM-CSF could efficiently promote the induction of CEA-specific CTL production. Our data suggested that Aex plus GM-CSF treatment was more efficient than Aex alone in the induction of tumor antigen (CEA)-specific CTL response, which may favor a beneficial clinical outcome in CRC patients.",

Malignant ascites may be present when CRC cells metastase and are seeded in the peritoneal cavity. Patients with malignant ascites are always correlated with poor prognosis in clinical practice.31 However, isolation of exosomes contained in effusions and the induction of antitumor immune responses by Aex may be beneficial in clinical therapy of CRC patients with ascites. Immunotherapy of CRC with malignant ascites has not been performed in clinical trials. In this study, we have assessed the feasibility, safety, and efficiency of Aex plus GM-CSF in the treatment of CRC. We have demonstrated that Aex plus GM-CSF treatment is more efficient than Aex alone in the induction of tumor-specific systemic antitumor immunity and CTL responses. The treatment protocol tested in this study causes grade I or II toxicity in CRC patients, suggesting that the successfully isolated Aex can be safely applied in clinical trials. Therefore, our phase I clinical trial data suggest that the Aex from CRC patients can be selected to induce antitumor immunity, and the presence of GM-CSF as adjuvant can significantly promote the efficiency of the vaccine Aex.",

            "text": "We show in this study that Aex contain CEA, MHC molecules, and HSPs, which may be recognized by epidermic antigen-presenting cells and, in turn, stimulate the activation of T lymphocytes. Our in vivo DTH tests have confirmed that Aex alone are sufficient in the induction of systemic anti-Aex immunity, suggesting that the Aex alone are immunogenic. Our detection of CTL responses in the DTH sites\u2013derived cultured cells indicates that Aex can activate CD8+ CTL and may elicit tumor antigen (e.g., CEA)-specific antitumor immunity. However, it is surprising that Aex alone, even at doses >200 \u03bcg, are rather inefficient in the induction of tumor-specific CTL responses, which may be due to the poor immunogenecity of Tex. Both Dex and Tex have been explored as cancer vaccines.5,6,20,21 The studies show that both Tex and Dex are efficient in the induction of tumor-specific immunity and the regression of tumor progression.5,6 Although Dex are a potent vaccine in tumor immunotherapy, controversial conclusions regarding the efficiency of Tex in tumor immunotherapy have been drawn.32,33,34,35,36 There is evidence suggesting that Tex may be a kind of tumor escape mechanism and can induce tolerance of the host to tumor antigens.32,33,34 Interestingly, the immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and tumor growth factor-\u03b2, have been detected in the Tex.32 Therefore, Tex may be of poor immunogenicity in clinical patients. However, exosomes derived from malignant effusions of melanoma patients are efficient in delivering melanoma antigens to autologous DC in vitro, suggesting that Aex may need the assistance of competent DC to present the antigens contained in Aex (either as an MHC\u2013antigen peptide complex or as HSP-chaperoned antigens) to T cells in vivo.16 The malignant effusions, ascites, used in our study may also contain DC, T cells, methothelial cells in except of CRC cells. Therefore, the Aex we have tested may be a mixture of exosomes derived from various origins. Because exosomes derived from different origins are similar in morphology, gradient density, and protein components,1,2 it is hard to speculate which kind of exosomes are involved in the observed immune responses and clinical outcomes. However, based on the previous studies,16,18,19 the detection of CEA in Aex and the cytology examination of peritoneal cast-off cells (data not shown), we suggest here that the major exosomes were derived from CRC cells seeded in the peritoneal cavity, and the exosomes derived from DC, T cells, and methothelial cells may also contribute to the induction of host immune response against CRC. Further examination of specific markers for these cells may help to answer this question.",

Therefore, the immunogenic potential and efficiency of Aex still remain to be investigated in clinical trials.
