It also is relatively easy to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing on cultured isolates, so conventional culture methods with biochemical phenotyping remain the most common procedures performed in clinical microbiology laboratories [1] . To further assist in microbial identification, nucleic acid amplification has been introduced in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Such testing was initially done for viruses, allowing detection of small amounts of viral nucleic acid quickly. Similar tests also have been applied to bacteria, especially those that are difficult to grow on routine culture media, or are slow-growing such as Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycobacterium. In addition, there are ongoing efforts to integrate these new techniques into routine clinical microbiology testing, including the diagnosis of sepsis [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 419, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1024, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The development of nucleic acid amplification has proceeded at an unprecedented pace and achieved higher sensitivity and specificity [2] .

We must pay close attention to the technical progress of the nucleic acid extraction as well as to the method for amplification and detection of nucleic acids in order to obtain satisfactory results. Nucleic acid extraction consists of three major processes: isolation, purification, and concentration. Commercial extraction kits are commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory [2] . These kits provide the essential requirements for nucleic acid extraction. These essential requirements have been well described by Boom et al. [6, 7] as follows: (1) extraction should be simple and rapid and should show high sensitivity and specificity; (2) it is preferred that there be no requirements for specialized equipment or special knowledge and skills; (3) the final nucleic acid should be pure and easy to modify for various amplification techniques; (4) the reagents and their product should be harmless; and (5) the process of preparation should resist contamination with other specimens. If the final volume of eluate is small, detection limits are maximized. When we deal with clinical specimens, we also should consider the elimination of potential inhibitors of the DNA polymerase and the removal of pathogenicity from hazardous pathogens as well as good target recovery and establishment of the integrity of nucleic acid targets [2] . Ideally, the final target is pure nucleic acid without amplification inhibitors or contaminants such as proteins, carbohydrates, and other nucleic acids [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 168, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 169, "end": 171, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 342, "end": 345, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 346, "end": 348, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 739, "end": 742, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 889, "end": 892, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 893, "end": 895, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1003, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1696, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1855, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "There are a few points that must be specially considered when a laboratory evaluates the use of nucleic acid extraction in the field of clinical microbiology.

In terms of nucleic acid extraction, the same nucleic acid may be targeted, but there are different implications for the extraction procedure itself. Nucleic acid extraction from cultured bacteria is relatively simple because the isolated microbes are pure colonies that contain large numbers of organisms. However, it is important to recognize that gram-positive bacteria have thick cell walls, which makes nucleic acid extraction more difficult than it is with gram-negative bacteria, which have thinner cell walls [5] . For clinical specimens, the details of the extraction method depend on the characteristics of each specimen. It is important to remember that the goal of extraction is nucleic acid, not of humans, but of bacteria, virus, or fungus. If DNA or RNA is extracted from clinical specimens containing human cells, these extracted specimens will contain human DNA; the recovery of microbial DNA thus may be diminished by the presence of human DNA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 211, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 731, "end": 734, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Since 1950, density gradient centrifugation using cesium chloride (CsCl)/ethidium bromide (EtBr) has been used for DNA extraction and has become the standard method in research laboratories [9, 10] .

For example, each DNA can be separated as independent bands because of the differences in each DNA's density in the gradient caused by the intercalation of EtBr [7] . However, there are important limitations for this method in that it requires an expensive ultracentrifuge, is labor-intensive and difficult to perform, and requires more time and EtBr is harmful [7, 8] .

The process consists of the vigorous mixing of a phenol-chloroform solution with the sample followed by centrifugation [7] . Phenol does not completely inhibit RNase activity, and this characteristic allows isolation of nucleic acid that has \"dissolved\" in the chloroform and phenol mixture [12] . After centrifugation, the upper (aqueous) phase containing the DNA can be separated from the lower (organic) phase containing denatured proteins, and DNA can be precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol with a high concentration of salt [8] . After washing with 70% ethanol to remove any remaining ethanol or isopropanol, the final target DNA is collected by dissolving it in TE buffer or sterile distilled water [13] . This method is also used for RNA extraction by concomitant use of guanidinium isothiocyanate. This combination can overcome the limitation of RNA extraction using the guanidinium isothiocyanate itself, so RNA could be isolated conveniently using a single-step technique by Chomczynski et al. [12, 14] Total RNA is recovered by precipitation with isopropanol after separation of the upper phase containing the total RNA from the lower phase containing DNA and proteins [12, 14] . Although the phenolchloroform method is relatively easy compared with the CsCl/EtBr gradient and is very useful for the extraction of nucleic acids, it also is problematic for the clinical microbiology laboratory because phenol has important limitations due to its being toxic, caustic, and flammable [5, 15, 16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 196, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 365, "end": 369, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 613, "end": 616, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 789, "end": 793, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1096, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1268, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1272, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1579, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1583, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1587, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phenol-Chloroform Extraction"}, {"text": "McCormick et al. introduced a new DNA extraction method involving solid-phase extraction in 1989 [17] . They used an insoluble siliceous core particle rather than liquid phenol. The function of this siliceous core particle is similar to that of phenol, but it has several major advantages in that it is safer, and cross contamination can be reduced. It is well known that the precipitation in the phenol/chloroform method causes DNA loss, and Meijer et al. demonstrated that this DNA loss could be reduced by replacing the precipitating step with silica particles [18] . Solid-phase nucleic acid extraction was incorporated into many commercial kits, and it still is the basis of many extraction methods, although siliceous core particles have been replaced by other materials such as silica matrices, glass particles, diatomaceous earth, and anion-exchange carriers ( Table 1 , Fig. 1 ) [7] . Solid-phase extraction uses a spin column operated by centrifugal force allowing DNA to be purified rapidly and efficiently without the limitations of liquid extraction, including incomplete phase separation [8] . Solid-phase extraction using silica now is one of most common methods for nucleic acid extraction. Silica that possesses a positive charge combines strongly with DNA, which possesses a negative charge, so it can enable rapid, pure, and quantitative purification [7] . In 1990, Boom et al. [6] used an innovative approach in which diatomaceous earth served as a matrix for solid-phase extraction. The principle of this method is that it immobilizes DNA onto its particles in the presence of a chaotropic agent. The technique can purify rRNA as well as single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. It takes only a short time and can be applied to clinical specimens as well as to DNA and bacteria. The process of solidphase extraction involves cell lysis, nucleic acid adsorption, washing, and elution [7, 8] . Column conditioning is obtained using a buffer at a particular pH [20] . The nucleic acid will be released after cell lysis and decanting of lysis buffer into the column. Nucleic acid adsorption is completed in a chaotropic salt solution [20] . Washing buffer contains a competitive agent and can remove contaminants such as proteins and salts. In elution, TE buffer is applied to the column so that purified nucleic acid will be released [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 101, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 564, "end": 568, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 888, "end": 891, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1105, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1373, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1400, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1907, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1908, "end": 1910, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1983, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2151, "end": 2155, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2356, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 869, "end": 876, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 879, "end": 885, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Solid-Phase Extraction"}, {"text": "There is another important modification of solid-phase extraction, that is, the magnetic bead method.

The magnetic bead method is very simple and convenient; so many commercially available kits are used for this method [8] . Some manufacturers combined the techniques of solid-phase extraction with the use of silica and magnetic beads, which satisfies the customers' requests for time-and labor-effectiveness and efficiency (Fig. 2 ). This method is commonly used in automated extraction methods such as miniMag (bioMerieux) and MagNA Pure (Roche). In terms of new technology, additional commercially available kits using this new technique are being introduced into the market.

There was an important report concerning nucleic acid extraction for Aspergillus published by the European Aspergilus PCR Initiative. About 50% of failures to detect Aspergillus were attributable to the low concentration of nucleic acids extracted from the organisms in whole blood [59, 60] . The authors also pointed out that the PCR efficiency of Aspergillus is determined not by the PCR amplification but by NA exaction. Most common NA extraction methods for bacteria and viruses are not adequate for fungi. Indeed, NA extraction from fungi needs different procedures, including bead beating, freezing, and larger specimen volumes [60] [61] [62] [63] . To recover small amounts of fungal DNA from clinical specimens, a protocol should be established for an optimal extraction method. The QIAamp DNA blood kit was successful in extracting Candida DNA and was suitable to use with a TaqMan-based PCR assay, whereas all other kits tested failed to detect low amounts of Candida DNA [15] . Perry et al. [60] reported that the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL and Roche MagNA Pure LC platforms were suitable for A. fumigatus DNA extraction from EDTA-treated whole blood. However, there were significant differences between automated NA extraction instruments. Those investigators finally concluded that full validation of the NA extraction efficiency should be done even though others have reported good validation results with other organisms.
