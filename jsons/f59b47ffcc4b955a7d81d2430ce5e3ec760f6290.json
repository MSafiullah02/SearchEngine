The maternal infection may have occurred in the distant past with CMV excretion resulting from endogenous reactivation of latent virus, although it appears that perinatal acquisition is more frequent among infants born to women who have had primary infection during the pregnancy. In a recent study, 61% of 23 neonates who did not contract CMV in utero from mothers experiencing a primary CMV infection during gestation were infected in the perinatal period (12) . Perinatal CMV infections have not been associated with maternal CMV shedding from the pharynx or urinary tract (13) . It has been estimated that 10 % of seropositive American women excrete CMV from the genital tract at delivery (14) . Approximately 50 % of infants who are not breastfed and who are born to women with virus in their genital tracts at delivery will acquire CMV, with onset of viral excretion between 3 and 9 weeks of age (15, 16) . Thus, if the seropositivity rate for CMV in a given population is 50 %, 2.5 infants born to 100 women from that population will contract CMV at the time of delivery. About 30 % of infants nursed by seropositive mothers contract a CMV infection, viruria usually developing between 4 and 12 weeks of age (13, 17, 18) . Thus, if the seropositivity rate for CMV in a given population is 50 % and 50 % of the women breast feed, 7.5 infants born to 100 women from that population will contract CMV from breast milk. Transmission has been observed even more commonly from mothers who are viruric (17) or lacturic (18) and if breast feeding is continued for at least one month (18) . CMV infection rates in infants are highest in countries with high rates of CMV seropositivity and of breast feeding (13) .",

The first suggestion that neonatal CMV infection could be acquired by blood trans-fusion was made by McCracken et al. (21) . Subsequently, many epidemiologic reports have confirmed the association between blood .product administration and the development of neonatal CMV infections (20) . In a recent report transfusion transmission of CMV to neonates was proved using the technique of restriction endonuclease analysis to demonstrate the identity of CMV from a blood donor and two infected neonates (22) . For a blood product to cause CMV infection it must have been obtained from a donor infected with CMV. These \"infectious\" donors (unless acutely infected) are usually CMV seropositive and the virus is transmitted, after reactivation, from its latent state. We have shown -that blood derived from seronegative donors failed to transmit infection to any of 90 infants born to seronegative mothers. In contrast, 13.5 % of 74 infants of seronegative mothers who received blood from seropositive donors contracted CMV (19) . Infants born to seropositive mothers appear to be less at risk of acquiring a CMV infection from seropositive blood products. This is presumably related to the protective effect of passively acquired CMV antibody in these infants. In addition, if an infant born to a seropositive mother contracts a CMV infection, it is very difficult to determine whether the infection has been acquired from the mother or from the blood product transfusions.",

In one recent study, 7 of 21 (33 %) infants who acquired CMV postnatally developed symptoms, in temporal association with CMV viruria, which included some combination of hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, atypical lymphocytosis, rash and pneumonitis (26) . Other reports also have noted the importance of postnatally acquired CMV as a cause of pneumonia in young infants (27, 28) . The collaborative study conducted by Stagno et at. (28) identified CMV in 20% of t04 infants hospitalized between 1 and 3 months of age with pneumonitis. Chronic viruria in term infants who acquire CMV postnatally has also often been observed (15, 18) . However, long-term morbidity is uncommon. All of the 21 postnatally infected infants described by Kumar et al. (29) had normal physical, neurologic, audiologic and ophthalmologic assessements at one year of age. Psychometric testing of 17 of the 21 revealed a mean IQ of 107 (26, 29) . Similarly, follow-up of twenty-one term infants with maternally derived perinatal CMV infections cared for at another institution failed to identify long-term sequelae (30) . One study has reported a long-term consequence of CMV infections in postnatalty infected term infants (31) . This study, conducted in Finland, found that 18% of these children had delays in language development. However, this conclusion was based upon a Denver Development Screening Test performed at approximately two years of age. Audiometric testing was not performed and other potentially confounding variables such as maternal age and educational level were not evaluated. One of the reasons for the general lack of symptoms in infants born near term may be the presence of transplacentally acquired CMV antibody.",

They do not receive as much transplacental CMV antibody and the antibody that they do receive disappears more rapidly through catabolism and iatrogenic blood loss than in infants born near term (32) . Symptoms attributed to maternally derived CMV infections in these infants have included hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and pulmonary morbidity as manifest by prolonged oxygen requirement (32) . Symptomatic infection appears to be especially likely in those premature infants who begin excreting CMV before seven weeks of age (32) . Long-term sequelae in these infants included moderately abnormal EEGs (17 %) and severe handicaps (DQ < 70, severe neuromuscular impairment, or profound loss of vision or hearing) in 14 % (30). These late sequelae were also more likely in premature infants who had early excretion of CMV (< 8 weeks). Given the possible protective role of passive antibody, it is not surprising that perinatally-acquired CMV infections are more common and more severe if acquired from a non-maternal source by infants born to seronegative mothers. Such non-maternal sources include banked breast milk obtained from seropositive women or blood products obtained from seropositive donors. Most of the data evaluating the consequences of these infections has been derived from studies concerning transfusion related CMV. Morbidity associated with these infections has been almost exclusively in infants with birth weights < 1250-1500 g (19, 20, 24, 25, 33). These infants often have multiple-organ dysfunction (respiratory, cardiovascular and neurologic) compounding their CMV infection. This multiplicity of problems also makes it very difficult to determine how much of their morbidity is CMV related and how much is related to other causes. With this important reservation, disease attributed to transfusion-related CMV infections has ranged from mild self-limited illness to death. In some series up to 50% of premature neonates acquiring a transfusion-related CMV infection may have severe illness or die (19, 20) . Symptoms have included a \"septic\" appearance with a peculiar gray pallor and fever, pneumonia, apnea, respiratory deterioration, hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis and encephalitis. Laboratory findings have variably included both an atypical and absolute lymphocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, liver enzyme elevation, and hypoalbuminemia. Many of these findings are similar to those observed in infants infected in utero as a result of a maternal primary infection (7, 12) . This is not surprising; newborn premature infants are comparable in many ways to the fetus in late gestation. Hence, an infection acquired by a premature infant born to a seronegative mother may have the same consequences as a congenitally acquired infection.",

Those acquired from maternal breast milk could be prevented by prohibiting breast feeding if a mother is known to be CMV seropositive. It is probable however that the benefits of breast feeding outweigh the risk of acquiring a symptomatic CMV infection from this source. Breast feeding infants of seronegative mothers with milk derived from seropositive women is more likely to cause a symptomatic CMV, especially in prematurely born infants. Therefore, this practice should perhaps be discouraged. The highest risk circumstance for transmission of a CMV infection is created by administering blood products derived from CMV seropositive donors to CMV seronegative premature infants. These transfusion-related infections can be prevented by administering blood products derived from seronegative donors only (19) . Preliminary evidence also suggests that these infections can be prevented by using frozen deglycerolized packed red blood cells (34, 35) . Processing blood products in this way effectively removes viable leukocytes, the cells in which CMV is presumed to be latent. Saline washing of red blood cells, which results in only an 89 % reduction in white blood cells, is ineffective in preventing transfusionacquired CMV infections in neonates (36) . Eur. J. Clin.

The analysis of infants with perinatal HSV infection demonstrates that as many as 70 % of these infants are born to mothers with no history of symptomatic HSV disease (40) . In most cases, asymptomatic HSV excretion in the maternal genital tract at the time of delivery is the probable source of infection of the newborn. Asymptomatic HSV excretion can follow maternal genital HSV infection at some time in the past, i.e. as the result of reactivation of latent virus, or it may represent acute primary genital herpes in the mother. The attack rate of HSV infection in the infant is probably much lower for infants whose mothers are experiencing recurrent HSV at delivery because of the relatively lower virus inoculum and the localization of viral replication to external genital sites. Neutralizing HSV antibodies are also present in the amniotic fluid of these women. Their infants have transplacentally acquired serum HSV antibodies which can mediate virus neutralization as well as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (4, 41) . The theoretical maximum attack rate was less than 8 % based upon a study of 34 infants born to mothers with known recurrent genital herpes, who were inadvertently exposed to HSV by vaginal delivery (42). In contrast, the attack rate among infants born to mothers with primary genital herpes at delivery is estimated to be 50 %. Primary genital herpes in women is associated with a high frequency of viral infection of the cervix and prolonged excretion of HSV in high titers (43). The interval required for the production of neutralizing HSV antibodies following primary herpes is often 7 to 14 days.

Infection may begin around a fetal scalp monitor site. Conjunctivitis is not unusual in this form of neonatal herpes but the extensive stomatitis of primary HSV as seen in older children is rare. The mucocutaneous lesions can be difficult to distinguish from staphylococcal or other types of rash by clinical appearance, but must be identified as herpetic as soon as possible to allow early antiviral therapy. Direct immunofluorescence of a lesion scraping using HSV antibodies provides the most rapid and specific method of diagnosis; the Tzanck smear is not sufficiently reliable to role out this potentially life-threatening infection of the newborn. Viral culture of the lesions should be done to confirm the immunofluorescence result and is usually positive within 2 to 4 days.

If the mother has obvious genital herpes lesions, the risk to the infant can be reduced significantly by cesarean delivery prior to or within a few hours after rupture of the membranes. However, women with a history of recurrent genital herpes have intermittent asymptomatic shedding of the virus in the genital tract. Approximately 1-2 % of these women wilt have HSV excretion at the time of delivery (47). Because of the brief duration of episodes of asymptomatic shedding, antepartum cultures failed to predict the risk of exposure of the infant at delivery even when the culture was obtained within a week before the onset of labor. Nevertheless, the low attack rate for infection among infants exposed to recurrent maternal HSV combined with the low risk that asymptomatic shedding will actually be present at delivery, makes it unreasonable to recommend cesarean delivery for every woman with a past history of genital herpes.",

In a study conducted in the USA 18 of 43 (42 %) infants became positive for HBsAg after being born to mothers who had acute hepatitis B during gestation or within two months postpartum (66) . It was subsequently demonstrated that the risk of vertical transmission was high (76 %) if the maternal infection had occurred in the third trimester or early in the postpartum period and low (10 %) if it had occurred in the first two trimesters (67). Vertical transmission from a mother with acute hepatitis B seems to occur at the time of delivery'. This conclusion is derived from the observation that neonates are usually HBsAg-negative at birth but become HBsAg-positive between 4 to 12 weeks of age (67, 68). Transmission by breast feeding is another possible mode of maternal-neonatal spread. HBsAg has been detected frequently in breast milk (57, 69). It is quite likely that tra-tsmission by breast milk does occur but, because infection is much more likely to occur from exposure to antigen during birth, its relative contribution is neglibible. The decision to encourage or discourage breast feeding by HBsAg-positive mothers therefore should be individualized.",

This period corresponds to the incubation period of hepatitis B and further supports the supposition that there is contact with the virus at the time of delivery rather than transptacentat passage. Some studies have noted a high incidence of cord blood seropositivity but contamination with maternal blood cannot be established. The study conducted in Taiwan showed that 21 of 103 infants born to HBsAg carrier mothers had a positive cord blood sample (59) .

Prevention of severe and fatal cases of neonatal hepatitis B infections is obviously another goal, but the frequency of these infections is tow. For any prevention program to be effective the at-risk population must first be identified. Screening of pregnant women who may be positive for HBsAg is therefore of paramount importance. Pregnant women who are likely to be HBsAg-positive include women of Asian, Pacific Island or Alaskan Eskimo descent and women born in Haiti or sub-Saharan Africa. Other women at high risk for chronic hepatitis B infection for whom screening is indicated include those with a history of acute or chronic liver disease, those employed or treated in a hemodalysis unit, those employed or resident in an institution for the mentally retarded, those rejected as blood donors, those who have had frequent blood transfusions or occupational exposure to blood in medical-dental settings, those who have household contact with a chronic carrier of HBsAg, those with mutipte episodes of venereal disease, or those who use percutaneousty administered illicit drugs.",

Passive immunization needs to be given as soon after birth as is possible. Preparation should be made to inject 0.5 ml of HBIG in the delivery room. Whereas administration of HBIG within seven days of birth was originally found to be unsuccessful in reducing vertical transmission, administration within 30 hours of birth (usually within 30 minutes) was successful (79) . Although every effort must be made to give HBIG in the delivery room, if a mother is not identified as being positive until after this time, it still should be administered to the neonate. Some reduction in vertical transmission may still be possible. Passive protection against hepatitis B is effective for only a limited time, therefore if this is the sole form of immunoprophylaxis, successive doses must be administered (80) . In addition to HBIG, it is now recommended that exposed infants should receive three 10#g doses of the plasmaderived, urea, formalin and pepsin inactivated hepatitis B vaccine. The first dose can be given at a separate site at the same time as HBIG or it may be delayed until later in the first week of life. The second and third doses should be administered at 1 and 6 months of age. At least one month after the third dose of vaccine, infants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg, to determine the outcome of immunoprophylaxis. A randomized, double-blind controlled trial conducted in China has clearly demonstrated the enhanced efficacy of combined passive and active imnmnization over passive immunization alone (81) . Passive immunization alone had an efficacy of approximately 71% whereas passive-active immunization had an efficacy of almost 94 % (81). Infants had been followed up for a minimum of nine months at the time this study was published. A study being conducted in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles also shows that passive-active immunization reduces the chronic carrier rate to 10-12 % (82). Findings of another large randomized study conducted in Hong Kong supported the high efficacy of the combined vaccination approach and failed to demonstrate a significant advantage of multiple doses as opposed to a single dose of immunoglobulin (83). The dose of vaccine used in this study was only 3 #g. Infants had been followed up for at least six months at the time of analysis. Whereas declining antibody is evident in infants who receive passive immunization alone, combined passive and active immunization is associated with rising antibody levels and presumably more lasting protection (84) . With the means now at hand, every effort must be made to prevent the perinatal acquisition of hepatitis B and its consequent long-term sequelae.",

Seventy-six percent of the reported cases had as their only risk factor a mother belonging to a group with increased prevalence of HIV infection (89) . The high risk groups to which these mothers belonged included those who have used illicit drugs intravenously, those born in countries where heterosexual transmission of HIV is thought to play a major role (e.g. Haiti and Africa), those who have engaged in prostitution, and those who are or have been sexual partners of intravenous drug abusers, bisexual men, men with hemophilia, men who were born in countries where heterosexual transmission of HIV is thought to play a major role, or men otherwise known to be infected with HIV. Of all these high risk groups, the most important numerically appears to be illicit drug use. In one report 76 % of 59 infants with presumed vertically transmitted AIDS had one or both parents who were abusers of intravenous drugs (90) . It is believed that vertical transmission of HIV occurs transplacentally during pregnancy, during labor and delivery as a result of contact with contaminated blood or body fluids, or perhaps shortly after birth. Postpartum acquisition of HIV has been attributed to an infected blood product received by a mother who breast-fed the child for six weeks (91) .

The nosocomiat outbreaks which have been described are presumed to involve the spread of virus from patient to patient through hospital personnel. Therefore, in order to reduce the risk of neonatal infections, strict visiting regulations must be enforced during community epidemics of respiratory illness and all personnel with manifestations of a respiratory viral infection should be excluded from direct patient contact. Also, whenever feasible, infected infants should be isolated in a single room and cared for by a nurse who does not have to care for other neonates. The spread of RSV appears to be by close contact with infectious secretions through direct inoculation of large droplets or contaminated hands (116, 117) . Thus careful handwashing should be stressed. Infectivity is greater if virus is inoculated into the nose or eyes, and less if inoculated into the mouth (118) . It is not surprising therefore that the use of masks and gowns by hospital personnel does not effectively reduce nosocomial spread of RSV (i 19). However, preliminary evidence does support the effectiveness of eye-nose goggles (120).",

In contrast, older infants from 6 to 24 months of age are much more likely to develop severe diarrhea requiring hospitalization (134) . Rotaviruses do not cause direct infection of other organs; other symptoms of severe disease are a consequence of dehydration and electrolyte losses. One serious outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis has been described in which symptomatic high-risk newborns were infected with rotavirus (135). Rotaviruses replicate poorly in tissue culture. The presence of rotavirus in feces can be demonstrated by electron microscopy and by enzyme immunoassay or latex agglutination for antigen detection (131) . The antigen detection methods are reliable in symptomatic patients because of the high titers of virus present in stool.

In a prospective study, Bishop et al. found that infection of newborns with one rotaviral strain did not prevent subsequent reinfection but infants who had perinatal rotavirus infection did not develop severe diarrhea due to rotaviruses during the first three years of life (137) . The role of breastfeeding in preventing perinatal rotavirus infection remains controversial (138, 139) . Breastfed infants may be protected from the more severe symptoms of gastrointestinal infection by maternal antibodies to rotavirus present in breast milk. Recently, important progress has been made in developing effective rotaviral vaccines. Initial studies with the RIT4237 live attenuated bovine rotavirus vaccine showed a vaccine protection rate of 82 % in infants vaccinated just before a rotavirus epidemic (140) . However, vaccine-induced immunity is not likely to prevent rotaviral infection in the immediate perinatal period and is also probably not necessary.",

            "text": "). The detection of primary infection present at the onset of labor requires careful examination of all women in labor for herpetic lesions, regardless of past history. At the present time there is no standard serologic method for identifying women who may have had silent genital HSV-2 infection. In the United States, research serologic techniques which can detect antibodies to the HSV-2 specific glycoprotein gG have demonstrated that about 30 % of women have had past HSV-2 infection (49). Because of these problems, studies are in progress to determine whether HSV cultures should be obtained routinely from all women at the time of delivery. The hypothesis of this strategy is that exposed infants could be monitored carefully and treated immediately if signs of neonatal HSV infection occur. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an unusual cause of perinatal infection in the USA and Europe because more than 90 % of women of childbearing age who C.G.Prober etal. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. live in temperate climates have had varicella in childhood. In addition to perinatal infection, maternal varicella can cause the congenital varicetla syndrome.This syndrome is a unique constellation of anomalies present at birth in fewer than 5 % of infants born to mothers who have had varicella during pregnancy.",

            "text": "Unless viral cultures are obtained, these infants are often considered to have bacterial sepsis with negative bacterial cultures. ECHO or Coxsackie viruses were cultured from 41% of infants under two months of age who were hospitalized for suspected sepsis whereas bacterial pathogens were isolated in only 18%(128). The enterovimses are cultured from feces most reliably and may be present in oropharyngeal secretions; ECHO viruses can be isolated from CSF in the absence of pleocytosis. A serologic diagnosis can be made in retrospect for Coxsackie serotypes; the multiple serotypes of ECHO viruses makes serologic testing very difficult.The life-threatening manifestations of perinatal enteroviral infection include meningoencephalitis, hepatitis and myocarditis (129). Typical signs of infection among infants with severe illness include fever, lethargy, irritability, seizures, rash, abdominal distension, hepatomegaly and jaundice (t24, 127). The rashes associated with enteroviral infection are usually punctate, maculopapular and erythematous Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. but can be quite variable and are not diagnostic. Infants presenting with fever and lethargy may have no abnormal findings but liver function tests may be elevated at admission. The cerebrospinal fluid may show mild pleocytosis, slightly elevated protein and normal glucose.The highest risk of fatal infection is associated with fulminant hepatitis in infants with ECHO viral infection and with myocarditis in cases of Coxsackie infection (122). Modlin found that severe hepatitis was fatal in 83 % of infants with perinatal ECHO virus infection while 19 % of those with meningoencephalitis died(121). In addition, his analysis of the reported nursery outbreaks revealed that five of six infants who had acquired infection from their mothers died whereas the mortality rate among secondary cases in the nurseries was 3 of 24 (12 %). Fatal ECHO 11 infection was associated with undetectable neutralizing antibody against the virus in cord blood from four infants while seven infants who were infected with the same strain but were not ill, had titers from 1 : 20 to 1 : 320(123). Most fatal enteroviral disease is now caused by various ECHO virus serotypes. ECHO 11 serotype has been a particularly common cause of nursery outbreaks between 1956 and t982. Neonatal Coxsackie B outbreaks occurred in 1961, 1967 and 1972 but have been uncommon since then although sporadic severe disease continues to be diagnosed (122).Neonatal enteroviral infection as a consequence of maternal infection during community outbreaks cannot be prevented in most cases. Enteroviral infection should be considered among the causes of maternal fever during these periods so that delivery can be delayed if possible. Careful handwashing and limiting the number of people having direct contact with newborn infants should reduce the risk of infection from non-maternal sources during seasonal epidemics. The possibility of nosocomial infection must be considered if hospitalized infants have symptoms consistent with enteroviral disease during such periods. Viral cultures should be taken from these patients to determine whether infection control measures, such as cohorting of infants, need to be initiated. Low passive antibody titers in severely affected infants suggests that immunoprophylaxis with antibodies against the relevant enteroviral serotype might be effective. However, immunoglobulin did not appear to modify the attack rate or symptoms of ECHO 11 infection in a recent nursery outbreak (130).",
