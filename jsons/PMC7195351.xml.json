Immune-competent individuals might clear the infection, whereas this might not happen in patients affected by primary and secondary immune deficiencies. The vast majority of patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs) might be protected only by avoiding personal contacts because they have reduced number and/or dysfunction in switched memory B cells producing high-affinity antibodies.3, 4, 5, 6 As a consequence, since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy,7 to minimize the risk of infection, we shifted all patients with PADs attending our centers to home therapy and we activated a service of remote visits. To evaluate the impact of (1) the COVID-19 epidemic and (2) the switch from in-person visits to remote visits on the quality of life (QOL) of patients attending our primary immunodeficiency reference centers, we administered 2 questionnaires, the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life (CVID_QoL) questionnaire, a specific tool to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID),8 and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), a generic tool able to assess the risk of anxiety/depression.9 Both questionnaires were administered 4 weeks after the identification of the first Italian patient with COVID-19.",

Because intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) cannot be administered at home in Italy, those patients who were previously receiving IVIG were shifted to home-based treatment with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) administration. The transfer to home therapy was completed on March 4 when measures to contain the spread of the infection in Italy became mandatory. The remote assistance service started on February 24, and it is still ongoing. The remote service consists of active telephone contacts by the responsible physician to his or her patient every 4 days. The service is also active 24/7 to receive calls from patients. On March 9, we contacted all patients and we sent them questionnaires on the HRQOL assessment by email. On March 18, we closed the study. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants. Eligible patients met the following criteria: (1) having a diagnosis of PAD (CVIDs)4; (2) being already enrolled in the Italian Registry for Primary Antibody Deficiencies10; and (3) having participated in the previous QOL survey in 2017. We excluded (1) subjects with incomplete information and (2) patients who were not able to complete the interview.",

It includes also a summary measure named global CVID_QoL. The emotional functioning dimension includes 19 items on patient feelings. The relational functioning dimension includes 9 items on patients' relationship with relatives and nonaffected people; the gastrointestinal and skin symptoms domain includes 4 items on complications related to gastrointestinal manifestation or skin disease. Response options are formulated using a 5-point scale, with 0 = never and 4 = always, with higher values indicating increasing disability.

            "text": "Patient-reported outcome measures in clinical practice have been proposed as a means of facilitating doctor-patient communication, uncovering patients' problems, monitoring disease or treatment, and screening for functional problems. We have previously reported a poor HRQOL in patients with PADs by generic instruments, short-form-36 and GHQ-12, and by the CVID_QoL questionnaire, a disease-specific instrument.8 We demonstrated that HRQOL was lower than that reported in generally healthy population and that reported in patients with other chronic disease entities.11 Moreover, we showed that more than one-third of patients were at risk of anxiety/depression at all observation times, a percentage that reached two-thirds of patients, considering only the group of females. Disorders such as anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent in hospital settings and still often go unrecognized. Indeed, we suggested that a comprehensive evaluation of HRQOL assessment should be performed in each patient to document the outcomes of any relevant changes. This is especially true in times of major trouble such as the one being brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, patients affected by inborn errors of immunity12 are known to be more vulnerable to infections. Among them, patients with PADs lack antibodies that are important to block microbial infectivity and prevent diseases. The protective role of antibodies in other pandemics was reflected in the severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and H1N1, when convalescent plasma containing antibodies from patients who recovered from viral infections was used for treatment at the early stage of disease.13, 14, 15 Here, we reported data of a study conducted since the beginning of the epidemic in Italy on the possible and expected changes in the HRQOL between patients with PADs living in an Italian region with a high prevalence of COVID-19 and in an Italian region with a lower prevalence.16 All data were compared with HRQOL scores detected in the same group of patients in 2017, 3 years before the COVID-19 epidemic. The aim of the study was to detect changes in the HRQOL of patients with PADs due to COVID-19 and due to the change in care strategy we adopted. The latter began in late February 2020 by activating the transfer of all patients to home therapy and by activating a remote assistance service as a tool to contain the spread of the infection, to stop travel and exposure, and to permit uninterrupted care of established patients.17 After completing the transfer to home and activating the remote assistance service,18 we sent the HRQOL questionnaires. We had a high rate of responders. One of 3 patients reported a worsening in GHQ-12 assessment, being at risk of anxiety/depression. However, the GHQ status as well as CVID_QoL questionnaire scores were not different in patients forced to shift to home-based SCIG treatment in comparison with those who continued their usual treatment. In addition, we did not find any difference in GHQ status and CVID_QoL questionnaire scores between patients from north and central Italy, 2 areas with a different prevalence of COVID-19 at the time of our survey. Relevant items of the CVID_QoL questionnaire for being GHQ-positive are related to the fear associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to the fragility inherent to the condition of being a patient with PAD19: to be afraid to get infected, to get sick, to be a sick person, tired, and weak. Items that did not affect the GHQ-positive status were related to concerns about the CVID itself such as cough, diarrhea, diet problems, and joints pain, all problems previously identified9\n,\n11 as major drivers of poor QOL in our patients. Anxiety about running out of medications appeared as a major new issue for our patients with PADs, not previously described,20, 21, 22 even if we never faced a problem of shortage. Surprisingly, most patients with PADs were not at risk of anxiety/depression. No patients reported concerns on items related to the immunoglobulin therapy.",
