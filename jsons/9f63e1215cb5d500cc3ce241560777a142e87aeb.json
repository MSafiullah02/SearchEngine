This textual analysis of 5,780 publications extracted from the Web of Science, Medline, and Scopus databases was performed to explore the current research focuses and propose further research agenda. The Latent Dirichlet allocation was used for topic modeling. Regression analysis was conducted to examine country variations in the research focuses. Results indicated that publications were mainly contributed by the United States, China, and European countries. Guidelines for emergency care and surgical, viral pathogenesis, and global responses in the COVID-19 pandemic were the most common topics. There was variation in the research approaches to mitigate COVID-19 problems in countries with different income and transmission levels. Findings highlighted the need for global research collaboration among highand low/middle-income countries in the different stages of prevention and control the pandemic.",

After being introduced at the end of 2019, this disease was officially declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. 1 Until April 30, 2020, 185 countries/territories reported 3\u00b72 million confirmed cases with 227,847 total deaths, 2 and the highest-burden has been placed in European and American countries. 1 Serious health, social and economic consequences of COVID-19 have been well-recognized, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] especially among the elderly with comorbidities, homeless individuals, and also residents who face financial, mental, and physical hardships due to social distancing policies. 8 Given that COVID-19 is a new threat without any antiviral therapies or vaccines, current measures to mitigate this crisis depend heavily on the national and regional preparedness and responses. 9 However, optimal strategies to cope with the complexity of this pandemic demands substantial scientific evidence. Recently, the WHO has issued technical guidance for countries/regions and research institutions, as well as worked closely with global researchers to update the empirical evidence. 10,11 Efforts have been made around the globe to enhancethe understanding of the dynamic transmission of COVID-19, appropriate vaccine research strategies effective treatments, as well as the impacts of current responses on population health and well-being. 12 As a result, in the last four months, the number of publications about COVID-19 has been increased dramatically, including articles, reviews, letters to editors, or preprint documents. 13 These contributions have proven the importance of scientific research in pandemic preparedness as well as helping the governments to respond rapidly and effectively to the crisis. 14 .

Previous systematic reviews have been conducted to explore in detail the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, 16, 17 or the effectiveness of specific COVID-19 treatment, 18,19 and policies. 20 However, these studies were conducted on a small volume of articles. One potential approach to delineate the focus of the academic community is bibliometric analysis. This method has been previously applied to identify the rapid development of research output, the most prolific countries, journal information, and major concerns of research, but not provide a deep analysis of publications. [21] [22] [23] In this study, by using text visualization and topic modeling approaches as a part of natural language processing and machine learning, we aimed to explore the research focus in general and in countries with different levels of income and COVID-19 transmission features.",

Since the beginning of the pandemic, researchers have devoted special attention to the biology of SARS-CoV-2 (Topic 3 and 4) and made an enormous effort on various aspects of clinical investigation, such as diagnostic tests for detection of the virus, clinical examination of hospitalized patients and treatment for the disease (Topic 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15). Meanwhile, research on global and national responses to COVID-19 accounted for nearly a quarter of available literature volume (Topic 2, 12, and 13). Epidemiological characterization of COVID-19 and psychological disorders during the epidemic are also of great interest (Topic 1, 6, and 14).",

Meanwhile, since COVID-19 has been reported to have no noticeable effect on pregnancy, research on COVID-19 among pregnant women received relatively slight interest. 49 Regarding the research trend and level of interest of different country groups, it appeared that the share of publications regarding the topic about psychological health and related interventions was negatively associated with the income levels. This finding might imply that this topic might not be the priority of the countries, or in other words, developed nations even show less interest than the ones having lower-income. 50 However, we do believe that most of the studies about this topic were cross-sectional surveys in the community, which were more affordable for low-income countries to perform compared to other topics. Nevertheless, COVID-19 caused a significantly psychiatric impact, 51 and this impact maintained when the total number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in a country. 52 Developed nations are not immune from mental health issues and mental health services are often disrupted during COVID-19 pandemic. 53 In terms of treatment interventions, although all countries are making an effort to develop an effective treatment regimen, high-income countries, with their vast financial resources, greater expertise, and infrastructure, demonstrated their bold attempt at this research area. 54,55 Meanwhile, compared to low-income nations, we observed a lower share of SARS-CoV-2 test-related publications among low-middle income suggesting that these countries prioritized to other research fields such as treatment interventions given the resource-constrained. 56 Findings also suggested that research on comorbidities associated with COVID-19 is relatively underdeveloped in countries with sporadic cases, in contrast with the extensive understanding and research on the effects of comorbidities on COVID-19 of those countries with a high number of infections. 57,58 On the other hand, treatment interventions were not prioritized, while the level of transmission increases. Although some high-income countries such as the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom were classified as \"community transmission\" and greatly contributed to the progress of finding treatment interventions, most of the nations in this categories were lowmiddle income countries (e.g. South American and African countries) and the governments tends to focus on preventive methods to prevent the pandemic from getting worse. 2 This study has several implications. To begin with, while rapid transmission of COVID-19 has been triggering a strong need for the development of an effective vaccine, our results show minimalresearch on this research topic. In addition, since there have been anecdotalevidence that promising drugs for COVID-19, such as Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV). Chloroquine (CQ) andhydroxychloroquine (H0), show no significant benefits to health outcomes of patients, hence,eveloping an effective and safe medication specific for the treatment of COVID-19 is of utmost importance 59-61 . We also found a lack of research on the social stigma caused by COVID-19. Due to the rapid contagion of the virus, fear and anxiety about being infected can give rise to stigma and discrimination toward people, places, or things. For instance, people associated with the disease, such as being in the neighborhood of high risk or being civils of nations with a high rate of COVID-19, are often stigmatized. 62,63 Stigma can also arise when a person is released from quarantine, even though they have been confirmed to be negative and are no longera risk.
