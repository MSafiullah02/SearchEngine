By April 1st, 2020, there were more than 800,000 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection worldwide.Radiotherapy is continuous in treatment schedule. Interruption of the treatment or delay of the treatment may jeopardise therapeutic efficacy.Liang et al. [1] demonstrated that due to receipt of immunotherapy, cancer patients are at higher risk to be infected with COVID-19. Recently, Xie [2] et al. revealed cancer patients older than 60 years old have an excess risk of COVID-19 infection, which deserves special attention. Filippi et al [3] pointed out that as a cancer-specific treatment, radiotherapy must be applied to patients with indications.Achard et al [4] proposed that shortening treatment course can provide the essential treatment of cancer patients, reduce the possibility of COVID-19 exposure and lower the risk of COVID-19 infection at the same time.",
