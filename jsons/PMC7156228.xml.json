It\u2019s the most common neurological disease among young adults and meanwhile a major cause of physical disability among young adults [26], [85]. Current MS phenotypic classifications contain RRMS, CIS, PPMS and SPMS, which means relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, clinically isolated syndrome, primary-progressive multiple sclerosis, and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis respectively [71]. Among them, RRMS accounts for the majority of patients (about 80%) [87]. The hallmark of MS is leukocyte infiltration of brain tissue and subsequent axonal injury, demyelination inflammation and the formation of sclerosing plaques [54].",

Among the CD4 + T cells, Th1 cells and Th17 cells are dominant, the former producing IFN-\u03b3 (interferon-\u03b3), the latter secreting IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, and GM- CSF (granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor) [60], [123]. After the secreted substances enter the central nervous system, they activate astrocytes and microglia, produce a large number of chemokines and cytokines, and recruit peripheral immune cells to sites of inflammation [123]. The use of CXCR3 and CCR6 as markers of identification of Th17 cells not only reflects their pro-inflammatory status but also reflects their ability to migrate to localized sites of inflammation [118]. The initiation of T cell entry into the CNS is governed by integrin-dependent vascular adhesion and chemokine-driven trans-blood\u2013brain barrier [1]. The pathophysiology of MS is not fully understood. It appears that the autoimmune activity of Th17 cell-mediated aggressive attacks is one of the key mechanisms. Th1 cells secrete cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) leading to activation of macrophages and cytotoxicity while cytokines (IFN-\u03b3) produced by Th2 cells lead to activation of B cells and induction of antibody production. Th1 cytokines inhibit Th2 development, and Th2-related cytokines inhibit Th1 responses. The results of some studies indicate that a specific Th1-mediated immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of MS disease and that inhibition of Th1 response is protective against the development of MS, and it is reported that the transition from Th1 to Th2 cytokine has a beneficial effect on the clinical course of MS [46].",

There is growing evidence indicates that successful treatments are often related to changes in many other lymphocyte subpopulations, including B cells, NK cells, Lti cells, other ILC cells, \u03b3\u03b4T cells, NKT cells, MAIT cells and innate B cells.

Besides, EAE can be triggered by the adoptive transfer of myelin antigen-specific T cells, CD8 + T lymphocytes and Th1 and Th17 type CD4 + cells [66], [87]. The pathogenesis of EAE consists of two phases. First, the EAE priming phase: DC migrates to peripheral lymph nodes for self-antigen presentation, induces encephalitogenic Th cells. The second point is encephalitis Th cells are accumulated in the CNS to re-occur cognate antigen on local and CNS-invasive APC(antigen-presenting cells, homologous antigen) [102]. The pathological characteristics of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis are not uniform because they vary widely depending on the type of animal used and the type of epitope. The EAE model is relevant for RRMS mostly. MOG induces chronic progressive disease which is closer to SPMS in C57BL/6 mice whereas chronic relapsing-remitting disease in NOD/Lt and SJL mice and Lewis rats [87], non-classical chronic relapsing EAE in PL/J mice. MOG35-55-immunized NOD mice will first develop an acute episode of EAE and then undergo a secondary progressive EAE course. This model can be used to simulate the secondary progressive disease of some MS patients [39]. In DA (Dark Agouti) rats, recombinant rat MOG can be used to induce EAE, which is characterized by demyelinating and spinal cord injury with subcutaneous and perivascular inflammatory infiltration [25]. In SJL/J mice, PLP139-151 induced disease mimicking relapsing-remitting EAE [21], [25]. MBP can induce acute self-limiting or chronic recurrent disease / progressive disease in guinea pigs. T cell clones reactive with MBP peptides induce EAE in SJL/J mice, which is characterized by acute paralysis attacks, and mice can be partially or fully recovered [39]. Furthermore, spinal cord homogenate can be used to induce EAE in Biozzi ABH mice, recapitulating the clinical characteristics of MS, including secondary progressive disability and relapsing-remitting episodes, which can address the role of an adaptive immune response in neurodegeneration [55].",

            "text": "Mouse Hepatitis (corona) Virus (MHV) and Theiler\u2019s virus (TMEV) are the two most widely used viral in inducing chronic encephalomyelitis as MS animal models. Systemic exposure of animals to cuprizone(CPZ) is most commonly used for toxic demyelination models, other demyelination models caused by focal toxins, including focal injections of lysolecithin or ethidium bromide in specific white matter tracts and focal injections of some other toxins not widely in use, such as ionomycin, diphtheria toxin or 6-aminonicotinamide in the spinal cord [13], [63]. Among them, the CPZ model simulates the acute and chronic courses of MS and may be a useful tool for the development of new therapies that protect oligodendrocytes and stimulate myelin regeneration. The TMEV infection model is an animal model that specializes in studying the mechanisms of virus-mediated acute and primary progressive MS [87].Chemokines regulate lymphoid tissue development, lymphocyte transport, and homing, and leukocyte maturation as we all know [10]. In autoimmune diseases such as MS, characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory states and increased immune cell infiltration into tissue parenchyma, upregulated expression of chemokines is associated with elevated infiltration of macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes in lesions and plaques [62]. The levels of specific chemokine ligands such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12, and CX3CL1 continue to rise, resulting in sustained infiltration of immune cells [22], [97]. Many chemokines that are produced locally in the tissue, attract different kinds of leukocytes to the sites of infection and inflammation via selective receptors [10]. Chemokines could induce and activate leukocyte adhesion molecules, establishing a chemotactic concentration gradient that causes transendothelial monolayer recruitment [64], [110]. The induction of proteolytic enzymes promotes the opening of the BBB and mediates the retention of leukocytes in the central nervous system. Chemokines can also increase adhesion and migration of target cells through the BBB via interacting with leukocyte integrins [12], [106]. For example, autoreactive T cells targeting myelin components are triggers for MS disease and that\u2019s a vital step for the transport of inflammatory T cells to the CNS in MS. A lot of reports have analyzed the role of chemokines and chemokine receptors in the intrathecal accumulation of T cells in MS [111].",

Human and other mammalian genomes encode approximately 50 chemokines respectively. Most Chemokines contain four cysteine residues, naturally, they are divided into four classes according to structure character that the spacing between the first two of cysteine residue: CC(\u03b2), CXC(\u03b1), CX3C(\u03b3) and C(\u03b4) [113], [121]. In the first three subfamilies, the two cysteine residues are spaced out by 0, 1, and 3 residues separately, while in the XC subfamily the second cysteine residues do not exist [113]. The systematic names of chemokines consist of a prefix like CCL, CXCL, CX3CL or CL followed by an identifying number. Chemokine receptors are named according to which group of chemokines they bind [68], therefore their systematic names consist of a prefix like CCR, CXCR, CX3CR or CR followed by an identification number. In the system nomenclature, the \u201cL\u201d signifies a ligand while the \u201cR\u201d denotes a receptor. For example, CCL2 and CCR2, are named based on the above rules [113].",

Their expression is temporary, until the resolution of the situation [3], [127]. Homeostatic chemokines expressed in lymphoid or other organs constitutively, including CXCL12\u548cCXCL13 [86]. They mediate the homeostatic migration and homing of different cells containing lymphocytes, which is needed for the proper function of the immune system. In addition, developmental processes that related to the patterning of cells and complex movements often involve homeostatic chemokines [3], [127]. There is also a third class of bifunctional chemokines that are elevated in case of inflammatory conditions and are participated in normal immune defense. This group includes CXCL9, 10, 11,16, CCL1, CCL20, CCL25, etc [86], [99].",

CCR6 directs Th17 cells into the CNS and CXCR7 inhibits T cell migration. CCR7 migrates naive T cells and central memory T cells to peripheral lymph nodes [66]. Small molecule-mediated upregulation of CCR7 can ameliorate EAE through this role at the initial stage of the disease, providing a promising strategy for the more effective disease therapies development of MS [66].

CCL2 can be produced by cells such as endothelial cells, astrocytes, macrophages and microglia [47].

Due to the highest affinity of CCL2 for CCR2, most studies have focused on it [128]. There are two alternative splicing types of CCR2 in humans, CCR2A and CCR2B, which are 360 and 374 amino acids, respectively [15]. CCR2 is expressed on T cell subsets, immature dendritic cells, and monocytes, mediating their migration to endogenous CC chemokines such as CCL2 [124]. The endogenous ligands for CCR2 in humans are CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL13, CCL16, CCL24, and CCL26. It is worth noting that the first six are agonists while the last two are antagonists [113]. The endogenous ligands in mice for CCR2 are CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11 and in rats are CCL2, CCL7, CCL11.

            "text": "CCL2 levels in CNS are reduced during increased disease activity in MS [82]. According to the discovery of Franciotta D et al., CCL2 can be constitutively produced in the brain and CCL2 CSF levels in acute MS are lower than those in stable MS [34]. As demonstrated by Gd-enhanced lesions on MRI, RRMS patients with acute exacerbations had significantly lower CCL2 levels in CSF and serum than those without enhanced lesions [107]. However, in another study, the results were determined to have higher levels of CCL2 in CSF in patients with RRMS compared to controls. This difference between studies may be due to differences between populations, differentiation in CCL2 production at unequal stages of the disease, rarely using healthy controls or the different components of the control group in the study [83]. MS relapses have been shown to be induced by the depression of Th2 cytokines and predominance of Th1, while CCL2 can affect T cell differentiation and adjust the Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles. Thus, the decreased CCL2 levels in CSF might reflect an increase in Th1 activity during an acute episode [107]. CCL2 mRNA expression levels are dramatically increased in both the spinal cord and brain and CCL2 protein expression levels are significantly upregulated in the brain during the relapsing phase of MS. The CCL2 expression has a biologically relevant function in the relapsing EAE disease process due to the ability to improve relapsing clinical disease with anti- CCL2 treatment. The inhibition of relapsing EAE is relevant to a decreased influx of macrophages [51].",

Hulkower et al. not only demonstrated that CCL2 (MCP-1) mRNA was expressed with close temporal relation to symptom onset in the CNS of rats, but also noted that CCL2 mRNA could no longer be detected when the animals entered remission. It\u2019s a reasonable hypothesis that the encephalitogenic T cells secrete certain proinflammatory cytokines contains IFN-g and TNF-a, which is able to induce astrocytes to express CCL2(MCP-1) and RANTES etc. leads to the recruitment of additional mononuclear cells [51]. Upregulation of CCL2 in activated oligodendrocyte progenitors near the demyelinating region,it\u2019s possible that CCL2 differentiates into mature myelin to form oligodendrocytes by enhancing the activity of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, thereby allowing remyelination [31]. CCL2 and CCL3 play a role in a region-specific manner in cuprizone-induced demyelination(in C57BL/6J mice) and astrocyte activation, with special effects on gray matter [47]. In addition, current MS therapies (6-methylprednisolone or IFN-\u03b21a treatment) do not modify the circulating levels of CCL2 [34]. It is known that the proportion of CCR2+ Ly6Chigh cells in the CNS is positively correlated with the EAE clinical score. The recruitment of the proinflammatory CCR2+Ly6Chigh monocyte subpopulation involves chemokine CCL2 [49]. In addition, CCR2-/- mice did not illustrate CNS histopathology or clinical EAE(MOG induced in B6129PF2/J or C57BL/6J mice) and decreased obviously in T cell infiltrating when compared with control mice [32]. Recent evidence suggests that the highly phagocytic and inflammatory macrophages produced by blood-derived CCR2rfp/+ monocytes elicit demyelination in EAE. According to Nielsen et.al., assessment of the demyelinating effect of CCR2+ monocytes on cortical shows: Th/+ CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice developed EAE later than Th/+ CCR2+/+ mice, but their severity is comparable. More importantly, both perivascular cortical and subpial demyelination(MOG induced in C57BL/6J mice) of Th/+ CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly reduced compared with Th/+ CCR2+/+ mice [61]. The CCR2 + 190 G/A(rs1799864) polymorphism might elevate susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, but the effect appears to be limited to the individuals with no primary risk allele HLA-DRB1 * 15:01 [48].",

In the chronic disease stage, neuropathology is primarily immune-mediated, similar to human demyelinating disease MS (multiple sclerosis). Using this animal model, CCL5 is significantly expressed in the CNS during acute disease, and anti-CCL5 mAb-mediated neutralization results in delayed viral clearance with concomitant reduction of CCL5-induced migration of virus-specific T cells and activated macrophages, T cell and macrophage infiltration decreased and demyelination decreased. Experiments show that CCL5 contributes to macrophage entry and demyelination [38]. However, in another animal model, EAE model of MS, the immunological neutralization of CCL5 has no modulating effect. The use of DNA vaccination protocols to generate immunoneutralization antibodies against CCL5 also failed to inhibit disease induction in rat EAE(MOG induced in DA rats). CCR5 genomics deletion also did not protect EAE mice [30], [96].",

The expression of CCL5 may be disrupted by gene mutations and downregulation of its receptor CCR5. For example, a genetic polymorphism, ie, a single nucleotide substitution (A to G) at 403 position of the CCL5 gene promoter results in lower expression of CCL5, or in the 303 position of its receptor CCR5 promoter sequence, X32 (32 base pair deletion) of CCR5 gene coding region is associated with a lower MS severity index [79]. Although a significant increase in CCR5 expression has been found in MS patients, it appears that besides the CCR5\u039432 mutation, other haplotypes or polymorphisms, as well as other possible epigenetic and genetic factors, are vital for CCR5 expression in multiple sclerosis patients [37]. In addition, based on a summary of one review, there appears to be no consensus on the association of CCR5\u039432 mutations with MS, and the differences in the reports may reflect the genetic background of the study population and their exposure to environmental factors [37].",

CCR6, the receptor of CCL20, is selectively expressed by CD4 + T cells that produce the cytokine IL-17. Thus, the CCL20-CCR6 interaction is involved in the BBB disruption and follow-up migration of pathogenic T cells into the CNS [29].

This trend is identical with the results of the 2017 research of CCL20 serum levels in RRMS patients and controls by Li R et al, as well as the results that higher CCL20 serum levels in patients with SPMS, RRMS and PPMS in a 2014 study by Jafarzadeh A et al. [46], [65]. The study also shows that serum levels of CCL20 were associated with a progression index and showed a higher than remission period during relapse, while treatment type did not influence chemokine levels. This is also consistent with previous research results. However, serum CCL20 levels were higher during remission than in relapse significantly according to Kalinowska-Lyszczarz et al. [29]. One study showed a negative correlation between SIRT1 activity levels and serum CCL20 levels in patients. It is speculated that SIRT1 may down-regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB by deacetylating p65 in the promoter region of the CCL20 gene, thereby decreasing the expression of CCL20. This speculation requires further research to prove [65]. Serum CCL20 levels are not affected by disease patterns, gender and treatment options [46]. The researchers found that anti-CCL20 levels were inversely associated with clinical severity of EAE, and MS patients had lower antibodies levels which against CCL20 than healthy controls. Moreover, high levels of anti-CCL20 antibodies in human serum have biological activities that inhibit the TH17 CCR6 positive T cells migration. Based on experimental results, Abraham M et al. hypothesized that natural vaccination against CCL20, which can protect humans from autoimmunity MS development. It is further supposed that exposure to pathogens early in life might result in the production of CCL20 by autoantibodies and trigger a protective effect against MS development [1]. In the research of Jafarzadeh A et al., the CCL20 and CCR6 expression levels in the spinal cord of EAE mice (MOG induced in C57BL/6J mice) administered with PBS were evidently elevated compared to the control group [43], [44].",

In a 2014 study, women MS patients showed lower serum CCL22 levels, representing that a decrease in chemokine levels might have a great impact on the MS pathogenesis of women [46]. Compared with OND patients (non-inflammatory neurological diseases), the CSF level of CCL22 was evidently increased in MS patients at baseline [75]. The trend of the decrease in the A allele of CCL22 C/A SNP was put forward in MS patients compared with the control group [36]. CCL22 may primarily attract Treg cells, shutting down the adaptive immune response effectively [20]. The expression levels of CCR4 and CCL22 in the spinal cord of EAE mice(MOG induced in C57BL/6J mice) were significantly increased [43], [44]. CCL22 expression is related to increased severity of EAE, and anti-CCL22 treatment may improve EAE development, possibly by regulating inflammatory macrophage accumulation [28].",

In addition to B cells, there is a direct correlation in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients between CXCL13 levels and the number of plasmablasts and T cells [59]. Khademi M et al. determined the concentration of CXCL13 in CSF in healthy control populations and patients with MS and other neurological diseases (bacterial and viral infections), and the results showed a lesser extent rise by MS patients. Taken together, we believe that early detection of CXCL13 predicts disease prognosis [53]. CXCR5 is expressed in most B cells in the CSF compartment and all B cells in the blood, and in 20% to 30% of CD4 + T cells in both CSF and blood [89]. The deficiency of CXCL13 attenuated the glial hyperplasia and inflammation of white matter in the acute and chronic phases of EAE, indicating an improvement in the condition [9]. The results reflect that CXCL13 may bind CXCR3. Thus, CXCL13 may be involved in recruiting mononuclear cells expressing CXCR5 or CXCR3 to the intrathecal compartment in MS [105]. CXCL13 levels are reduced by natalizumab treatment in MS [53], [82]. According to Quinn JL et al., the antibody against CXCL13 could block Tfh transport and significantly reduce disease expression in Th17 EAE (EAE that induced by the myelin-specific Th17 cells transfer in C57BL / 6 J mice) [91].",

CX3CL1 promotes glial activation, ICAM-1 expression, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and recruitment of CD4 + T cells into the CNS during neuroinflammatory processes [114]. CX3CL1 exists in two forms: shed glycoprotein and membrane anchoring. The former soluble form has chemotactic activity against monocytes, T cells and NK cells [78].",

There are no considerable effects of an orally administered CCR1 antagonist (BX-471) on ICAM-3 expression in RRMS patients [93]. It failed in the phase II trial because of the efficacy lack. But it lays the foundation for the clinical development of other chemokine receptor antagonists [103]. High-throughput screening of Merritt JR et al's combinatorial series identified a new, moderately effective CCR1 antagonist 3. Library Hit 3 was optimized in order to synthesis advanced lead compound, therefore compound 4 was obtained. The IC50 of Compound 4 that inhibits CCR1-mediated monocyte chemotaxis was 20 nM [76]. The results of the study showed that although the antagonist did not stop the peripheral anti-MOG response(in DA rats), it prevented T cell infiltration effectively, macrophage infiltration and activation, thereby preventing subsequent CNS inflammation in the model. A single CCR1 selective antagonist, 5-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl]-2,2-diphenylpentanenitrile, can suppress MOG-induced EAE, indicating that CCR1 plays a non-redundant role at this stage [30].",

Some CCR4 antagonists combine with the allosteric site of CCR4, not the binding site of CCR4 to the ligand [102]. It may be for this reason that CCR4 antagonist compound 22 inhibits the Th1 and Th17 cell polarization as well as ameliorate EAE, but the CCR4 antagonist AF399 / 420/18025 had no significant impact on the clinical score of EAE [80], [84].

For example, in Phase I clinical trials, there was only one kind of CCR4 antagonists, GSK 2239633, as a possible treatment for asthma but still had no further development due to low bioavailability. This condition might be caused by complex pharmacology that has not been resolved, such as the CCR4 regulation on surface expression and transport aspects [102].

Karlstr\u00f6m S et al. exploited two parallel series, series A and series B of CX3CR1 antagonists for the MS treatment.

            "text": "The onset of MS is closely related to immune dysfunction, which is demonstrated by inflammation, oligodendrocyte death, loss of myelin and various degrees of axonal damage. The formation of MS plaques begins with antigen-presenting cells activating myelin-reactive T lymphocytes, resulting in multifocal immune cells infiltrating into the CNS (see Fig. 1\n) [126]. In inflammatory infiltrating cells with active demyelinating lesions, 10% are CD8 + and CD4 + T cells and 90% are macrophages from resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes [23]. Activated immune cells activate the proinflammatory cytokine cascade in the CNS, ultimately leading to demyelination, glial scars, and axonal lesions. Regulating the immune response and cell infiltration in the CNS is a therapeutic strategy that will improve treatment efficacy [123]. The role of chemokines and their receptors in autoimmunity and inflammation is recognized, and they also have important impacts on normal homeostasis, including lymphoid tissue development and cell transport. The chemokine system is rich in ligands and receptors, and studies have shown that a lot of chemokines and their receptors can be effective therapeutic targets for MS disease. By specifically interfering with chemokine and chemokine receptor function, it can prevent the infiltration of inflammatory cells, control the cascade of inflammation, and may also prevent demyelinating damage and promote remyelination, bringing a new treatment to MS. hope. However, the development of a single chemokine receptor antagonist has not achieved imaginary success, overcoming the redundancy of chemokine action, the development of multi-target antagonists or the combination of multiple antagonists may be the future The direction of MS drug development.",
