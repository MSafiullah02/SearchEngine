In the Asia\u2013Pacific region there are a number of special considerations related to particular population characteristics. Infection (including tuberculosis (TB)) and tobacco smoking are the major causes of respiratory disease and death. Pandemic illnesses such as influenza and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus bear special relevance to Asia as recent outbreaks have been traced to areas within the region, which has implications for disease control worldwide. Diseases resulting from air pollution and occupational exposures are of increasing importance as a result of the increasing industrialization of previously under\u2010developed economies in this region.",

This includes the large, economically ascendant Chinese population, a number of smaller low to middle income countries (see Table 1) and several relatively developed nations of which the largest are Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The Asia\u2013Pacific therefore comprises a heterogeneous group of populations whose respiratory health and health in general are influenced by diverse factors including economic wealth, population density and urbanization, climate, air pollution and industrialization, tobacco smoking, occupational exposures to toxic substances, and the availability and affordability of medical treatment. Within the region there are also a number of indigenous populations whose particular health problems are often difficult to address at a population level due to a paucity of data.\n2\n In general, indigenous health is particularly adversely affected by relative poverty, overcrowding and environmental contamination with the movement from traditional societies to urban environments, high prevalence of infection and smoking, and inadequate access to health care.\n2\n In discussing the Asia\u2013Pacific region as a whole, many of these issues that also affect the general population will be addressed.
