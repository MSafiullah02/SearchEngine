Yet not all have the same basic level of health infrastructure to deal with day-to-day health emergencies, let alone global health threats of this magnitude\n2. To date, a comparatively small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in regions with low resource settings (including Africa, Latin America and South Asia). However, as cases are expected to rise over the coming weeks those countries with resource constrained health care systems will be disproportionately affected\n3. If proven effective, readily implementable and scalable interventions are demanded. A means for researchers to rapidly categorise and identify priority trials assessing interventions that are affordable, readily available and adaptable particularly to low resource settings could assist this effort.",

While many living systematic reviews are updated on a monthly basis\n6, a weekly update has been selected due to the rapidly evolving context of COVID-19 and due to scheduled WHO ICTRP updates occurring weekly\n7. For all included trials, the source clinical trial registry database will be searched and the related trial record identified in order to supplement data extraction. A number of clinical trial registry databases\na are only imported to WHO ICTRP on a monthly basis. This living systematic review protocol will be iteratively revised and manual searches of some databases on a weekly basis may supplement WHO ICTRP weekly searches. Grey literature searching will also be conducted for technical or research reports of planned, active or completed clinical trials from industry, international and government agencies, and scientific research groups. Furthermore, as part of the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) and International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC)\n8 collaborative networks, additional trials of relevance may be identified and included through communications with our global research partners and through participation in a coalition to accelerate research on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in low resource settings\n3.",
