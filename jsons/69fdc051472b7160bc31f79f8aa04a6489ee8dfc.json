            "text": "The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease , which started in 2019. This is a member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols. This computational finding provides a molecular basis for the severity of COVID-19 infection due to the oxidative stress.",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or simply COVID-19 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family. 1 The other two viruses in this family that infect humans are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These are positive-sense, single-strand enveloped RNA viruses. The coronavirus particles contain four main structural proteins: the spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid. [1] [2] The spike protein protrudes from the envelope of the virion and consists of two subunits; a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the receptor proteins of host cells and a second subunit that facilitates fusion of the viral membrane into the host cell membrane. Recent studies showed that RBD of spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 belongs to the membrane-bound carboxydipeptidase family. It is attached to the outer surfaces of cells and is widely distributed in the human body. In particular, higher expression of ACE2 is observed in organs such as small intestine, colon, kidney, and heart, while ACE2 expression is comparatively lower in liver and lungs. [3] [4] The role of oxidative stress on the binding of viral proteins on the host cell surface receptors is a relatively underexplored area of biomedical research. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Previous studies have indicated that the entry of viral glycoprotein is impacted by thiol-disulfide balance on the cell surface. 5, [7] [8] [9] [11] [12] Any perturbations in the thiol-disulfide equilibrium has also been found to deter the entry of viruses into their target cells. 5 The first step of the viral entry involves binding of the viral envelop protein onto a cellular receptor. This is followed by endocytosis, after which conformational changes of the viral protein helps the induction of the viral protein into the endosomal membrane, finally releasing the viral content into the cell. These conformational changes are mediated by pH changes as well as the conversion of disulfide to thiol group of the viral spike protein. 7 Several cell surface oxidoreductases 9 regulate the thiol-disulfide exchange, responsible for conformational changes of viral proteins needed for virus entry into host cells.",

A recent study with the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (hereinafter referred to as CoV) has exhibited a complete redox insensitivity; 7 despite the reduction of all disulfide bridges of CoV to thiols, its binding to ACE2 remained unchanged. 7 However, this study did not probe the redox sensitivity of ACE2 receptor. Thus, in the present study, we computationally investigated the redox state of both partners (ACE2 and CoV/CoV-2) on their binding affinities. The structure of CoV 1 3 and CoV-2 14-15 complexed with ACE2 are known and the noncovalent interactions at the protein-protein interface 16 have been reported recently. Using these reported structures, molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic field calculations were performed to explore the impact of thioldisulfide balance on CoV/CoV-2 and ACE2 binding affinities. The structural and dynamical changes due to the change in the redox states of cysteines in the interacting proteins were analyzed and their effects on binding free energies were studied.",

Then, the RMSD values, averaged over conformations stored during 1 ns time, were plotted against the simulated time (Fig. 3 ). Compared to the starting structure, only a moderate backbone fluctuation was noted in all protein complexes during 20 ns simulations and the maximum of RMSD was in the range of 2.0-3.8 \u00c5 ( Table 2 ). The evolution was smooth and its stability was demonstrated by the standard deviation of the computed RMSDs, which was less than 0.3 \u00c5.

Furthermore, ACE2, which the viral spike proteins latch on to, is known to be a key player in the remedial of oxidative stress. 20 Binding of the viral protein will prevent the key catalytic function of ACE2 of converting angiotensin 2 (a strong activator of oxidative stress) to angiotensin 1-7 thereby creating a vicious circle of enhanced viral attack.

Setting up of protein systems and all structural manipulations were carried out using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD). 21 Disulfide groups were modified to thiols during setting up of structures using standard VMD scripts. Molecular optimization and dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) package using CHARMM36 force field. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] During MD simulations, electrostatic energy calculations were carried out using particle mesh Ewald method. 27 Backbone root-mean-squaredeviation (RMSD) calculations were performed using VMD. Protein-protein interactions were studied using Adaptive-Basis Poisson Boltzmann Solver (APBS). 28 Electrostatic field calculations were performed using PDB2PQR program suit. 29 Molecular Dynamics Simulations. All simulations were performed using the structure of ACE2 bound SARS-CoV (PDB entry: 3D0G) 1 3 and SCAR-CoV-2 (PDB entry: 6M0J) 15 . In all simulations, setup of protein complexes systems was carried out following protocols used previous studies from this lab. 17, 30 Briefly, hydrogens were added using the HBUILD module of CHARMM. Ionic amino acid residues were maintained in a protonation state corresponding to pH 7. The protonation state of histidine residues was determined by computing the pKa using Binding Free Energy Calculations. Gibbs free energies of binding between the ACE2 and SARS CoV or CoV-2 proteins were calculated using APBS using a standardized method of a treecode-accelerated boundary integral Poisson-Boltzmann equation solver (TABI-PB). 33 In this method, the protein surface is triangulated, and electrostatic surface potentials are computed. The discretization of surface potentials is utilized to compute the net energy due to solvation as well as electrostatic interactions between the two protein subunits, as outlined in thermodynamic scheme, Scheme 1. Following Scheme 1, the free energy of binding of the two protein fragments in water, can be expressed as a sum of two components (eq. 1)",

The MD simulation results indicated that the flexibility of different structural elements of the interacting proteins altered upon the cleavage of disulfide bridges (oxidized state) producing sulfydryl (thiol) groups (reduced state). The impact of the reduction of the disulfide bridges was probed by calculating per-residue RMSD of each complex from the trajectories of MD simulations. Changes in the backbone flexibility due to complete reduction of all disulfides to thiols of both interacting proteins are shown in Figs. 4a and 4b, where the backbone is color-coded to indicate the magnitude of thermal fluctuations. Larger and smaller backbone fluctuations are shown in red and blue, respectively, whereas the medium fluctuation regions are shown in green. The backbone fluctuation analysis demonstrated that the cleavage of disulfide bridges indeed affected the flexibility of the local regions as they became more dynamic (Fig. 4b). A significant alteration in backbone flexibility was noticed at the interface of CoV and ACE2 subunits when both proteins are in the fully reduced states i.e. all disulfides are changed to sulfydryl groups. As it is evident from the Fig. 4b, the helix (residues 52-64) of ACE2 became very mobile, due to the rupture of the nearby C344:::C361 disulfide. The second region belongs to the flexible loop consisting residues 463-474 of CoV subunit (residues 478-489 of CoV-2 subunit), which interacts with the N-terminal segment of the ACE2. The cleavage of the disulfides C467:::C474 in CoV and C480:::C488 in CoV-2 resulted in higher thermal fluctuation. Binding study.

These results indicate that the binding will be severely impacted, when the disulfides of both interacting proteins are converted to thiols. This finding is potentially significant as it indicates that the cleavage of disulfide bridges in ACE2 has significant destabilizing effect on the spike protein binding.Molecular basis of the impaired binding. The conjoined two helices of ACE2 (residues 19-53 and residues 56-94) form a complementary shape (Fig. 5) that fits into the concave-shaped loop\u03b2 -sheet-loop motif (residues 460-490 of CoV and residues 475-505 of CoV-2) of RBD of viral spike proteins. The loss of disulfide bridges in ACE2 made a strong impact on the junction of the two conjoined helices (Fig. 5, CoV red \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 red ). This region is close to the disulfide bridge C344:::C361 and its cleavage has significant impact on the shape complementarity at the proteinprotein interface. Similarly, the loss of C467:::C474 disulfide in CoV (C480:::C488 in CoV-2) resulted in a significant conformational change in the loop region, which was displaced away from the protein-protein interface by ~6 \u00c5 indicating a reduced binding interactions as confirmed by the binding free energy calculations. This conformational change as well as the alteration in the backbone flexibility (Fig. 4) must have resulted in impaired binding of CoV/CoV-2 with ACE2.",

For formation of a stable protein-protein complex, this energy is needed to be counterbalanced by the negative electrostatic interactions, Coul G, between the interacting proteins.When the disulfides of the RBD of CoV and CoV-2 were reduced to thiols, the impact of reduction on the binding of these two proteins with ACE2 was different. The computed \u2206 bind G o for CoV ox \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox and CoV red \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox are \u22127.3 kcal/mol and \u221211.2 kcal/mol, respectively(Table 3) indicating a slightly tighter binding of the reduced CoV RBD to ACE2. The experimentally known K d value for CoV ox \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox system is 325 nM, 14 which corresponds to a \u2206 bind G o value of \u22128.9 kcal/mol. Therefore, the computationally determined \u2206 bind G o for CoV ox \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox binding is comparable to the experimental value. Although, there is no experimentally determined K d available for CoV red \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox system, the binding assay with CoV red RBD found to have no redox sensitivity for its binding to ACE2.7 The small favorability of CoV red \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox binding, as observed from the computation, indicates that the reduction of CoV did not have much impact on its binding affinity for ACE2 and could explain the experimentally observed redox insensitivity.s 7 In the case of CoV-2, its binding with ACE2 became less favorable when all the disulfides of RBD were reduced to thiols. The computed Gibbs binding free energies was increased by ~ 4.5 kcal/mol for the reduced CoV-2; \u2206 bind G o of CoV-2 ox \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox and CoV-2 red \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox are \u221210.4 kcal/mol and \u22126.0 kcal/mol, respectively.In contrast, the reduction of disulfides of ACE2 impaired the binding significantly for both observed for the oxidized from of ACE2 (i.e. CoV ox \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox and CoV-2 ox \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5ACE2 ox in",
