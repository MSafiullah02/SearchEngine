On February 11, 2020, the WHO officially renamed this infectious disease coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The coronavirus study group within the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses also renamed 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world, with cases reported in China [1] and 168 other countries, areas, and territories. As of 20 March 2020, the COVID-19 disease caused 8778 deaths as noted by the WHO (https://www.who.int).",

By contrast, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, blocks the cleavage of sialic acid and the subsequent entry of the virus into the cell [5]. Importantly, favipiravir, unlike oseltamivir, does not seem to generate resistant viruses [5]. This property of favipiravir suggests a potential benefit in the treatment of critical infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (Figure 1).",

When SARS-CoV-2 particles bind to their receptors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), aminopeptidase N (APN; CD13) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; CD26), viral RNA is passed to the host cell, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) produces viral RNAs. During RNA methylation, the RNA cap is formed, which protects against the host innate immune response, which involves the secretion of interferons (IFNs) and cytokines (CKs). The viral (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) plays a critical role in RNA capping, using the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). The process of viral RNA synthesis and the translation of proteins is associated with pH-dependent membrane stress, which can elicit adverse effects against immune and non-immune cells. If the viral replication cycle is not inhibited and infected cells are not eradicated, packed viruses will be disseminated to other cells in the host. Proposed drugs and their possible acting points against COVID-19 are shown by bold lines.",
