In contrast, animal coronaviruses are known to cause devastating epizootics of respiratory or enteric diseases in livestock and poultry [2]. The SARS coronavirus is clearly new to the human population and its RNA genome differs substantially from sequences of all known coronaviruses.",

QSAR searches information relating chemical structure to biological activity by developing a mathematical model. Building of a QSAR model begins with calculating theoretical parameters or selecting structural features for the compounds involved. Nowadays, hundreds of descriptors could be generated in QSAR studies, but only some of them are statistically significant in terms of correlation with biological activity for a particular analysis. Therefore, variable selection techniques have become important for producing a useful predictive model. A suitable feature selection method ensures the model stability and the consistency of relationship between the descriptors and biological activity [13].",

The fuzzy part of ANFIS is mathematically incorporated in the form of membership functions (MFs). A membership function \u03bc\nAi(x) can be any continuous and piecewise differentiable function that transforms the input value x into a membership degree, that is to say a value between 0 and 1. The most widely applied membership functions are the generalized bell (gbell MF) or the Gaussian function in Eqs. (6), (7), which are described by the three parameters, a\u2013c. Therefore, Layer 1 is the fuzzification layer in which each node represents a membership:(6)\u03bcAi(x)=11+((x\u2212ci)/ai)2bi\n(7)\u03bcAi(x)=exp \u2212((x\u2212ci)/ai)2As the values of the parameters {a\ni, b\ni and c\ni} change, the bell-shaped functions vary accordingly, thus exhibiting various forms of membership functions on linguistic label Ai. Parameters in this layer are referred to as premise parameters.\nLayer 2. Every node in this layer is a fixed node labeled, whose output is the product of all the incoming signals:(8)O2,1=wi=\u03bcAi(x)\u00d7\u03bcBi(y) for i=1,2Every node in this layer computes the multiplication of the input values and gives the product as the output as in the above equation. The membership values represented by \u03bc\nAi(x) and \u03bc\nBi(y) are multiplied in order to find the firing strength of a rule where the variables x and y have linguistic values Ai and Bi, respectively.\nLayer 3. This layer is the normalization layer which normalizes the strength of all rules according to Eq. (9):(9)O3,i=w\u00afi=wiw1+w2 for i=1,2where w\ni is the firing strength of the ith rule which is computed in layer 2. Node i computes the ratio of the ith rule's firing strength to the sum of all rules\u2019 firing strengths. For convenience, outputs of this layer are called normalized firing strengths.\nLayer 4.

The main skeleton with different functional positions for pyridine N-oxide derivatives is shown in Fig. 2\n. A list of inhibitory activities is given in Table 1. Prior to the calculation of the molecular descriptors, the 3D structures of the studied compounds were optimized using semi-empirical quantum-chemical methods of PM3 implemented in Hyperchem computer program [20]. In this work, over hundred meaningful descriptors were calculated for each compound, which encoded different aspects of the molecular structures. These descriptors were consisted of constitutional, topological, electronic, geometric and empirical descriptors. Pairs of descriptors that were highly correlated (R\n > 0.90) encoded similar information, and therefore one of them has been eliminated. Descriptors with constant or almost constant values for all molecules were also eliminated. All these molecular descriptors were generated using Dragon3 software [21]. Table 2\nshows 15 different combinations of calibration and validation subsets used for the variable selection via shuffling MARS.

Then the molecules were divided into six groups, five groups of them consisted of twenty molecules each and one consisted of nineteen molecules. Each group was selected in such a way that it consisted of all range of inhibitory activity from weak to highly active compounds. In the variable selection procedure, four groups were applied as calibration set and the two remaining subsets were used as validation set for evaluating the selected parameters. The data set was divided into six subgroups, so, we can make 15 MARS models with various calibration and validation sets. Because these calibration and validation sets contain different molecules, various descriptors are expected to be selected by MARS search strategy, in each model. In the calibration procedure, the forward selection and backward deletion algorithm uses the parameter, root mean square of validation set (RMSEv) as an index for evaluating the selected split points. Statistical parameters obtained for 15 models are shown in Table 2. The selected descriptors and the frequency of each descriptor in shuffling-MARS models are shown in Fig. 3. Inspection of this figure shows that parameters of solvation connectivity index (X3sol), length to breadth ratio (L/Bw), relative negative charge (RNCG), harmonic oscillator of aromatic index (HOMA), average molecular weight (AMW) and total path count (TPC) have appeared more frequently (more than 10 runs) in the 15 runs compared to the other descriptors. These six descriptors are among topological, electronic, geometric, constitutional and aromaticity descriptors. The detailed description of these descriptors is given in Reference [23]. The most important selected variables (six variables) using the shuffling MARS algorithm were used as inputs for developing the ANFIS model to predict the value of pIC50 for the SARS inhibitors.",

However, several authors suggest that a high value of QLOO2 appears to be necessary but not sufficient [26]. Consequently, we also used LMO-CV and Y-randomization techniques. In the case of LMO, M represents a group of randomly selected data points which would leave out at the beginning and would be predicted by the model which was developed using the remaining data points. Therefore, M molecules are considered as prediction set. The RLMO2 can be calculated by using Eq.

In order to assess the robustness of the shuffling MARS\u2013ANFIS, the Y-randomization test was applied in this contribution. The dependent variable vector pIC50 was randomly shuffled and a new QSAR model was developed using the original variable matrix. The new QSAR model is expected to show a low value for Rp2 and QLOO2. One hundred random shuffles of the y vector were performed for which the results are shown in Table 4\n. The poor values for the mean of R\n2\np and QLOO2 indicate that the good results of the shuffling MARS\u2013ANFIS model are not due to a chance correlation or structural dependency of the training set.",

This is more serious when the data set under study is diverse or the mechanism of the process is complex. The data set considered in this work consisted of drug-like molecules inhibiting SARS and consequently, the mechanism of their action could be complicated. An approach of shuffling MARS\u2013ANFIS was successfully applied for predicting the inhibitor activity of pyridine N-oxide derivatives against SARS. The reasons behind this success could be: (1) the strength of the shuffling MARS as feature selection technique. It is shown that the six parameters of AMW, X3sol, LBw, RNCG, HOMA and TPC chosen by shuffling MARTS affect significantly the inhibition process of the drug-like molecules. (2) The role of ANFIS as mapping model which has the power of prediction of the inhibition behavior. It is a general framework that combines two technologies, namely neural networks and fuzzy systems; by using fuzzy techniques, both numerical and linguistic knowledge can be combined into a fuzzy rule, which require extensive trails and errors for the optimization of their architecture. The shuffling MARS\u2013ANFIS has been testified to be an effective method for variable selection and developing model by using the cross-validation techniques of leave-one-out, leave-multiple-out and also Y-randomization. Comparing the results of GA-PLS-ANFIS with those for shuffling MARS\u2013ANFIS reveals that the latter model selects the best variables to predict the inhibition action of pyridine N-oxide derivatives. The appearance of the above-mentioned parameters in the model indicates that type of the atoms, size of the molecule, complexity of the compound, aromacity and elemental composition of the molecule are playing roles in the mechanism of inhibition.",
