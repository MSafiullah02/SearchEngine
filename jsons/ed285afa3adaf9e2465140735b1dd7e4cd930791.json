Because about 95% of infants <2 years old are infected with respiratory syncytial virus, however, bronchiolitis is the commonest reason for admission to hospital in the first 6 months of life. It is usually a self-limiting condition lasting around a week in previously well children. About 1% of infants are admitted to hospital, and about 10% of hospitalised infants will require admission to the intensive care unit. Respiratory syncytial virus is isolated from about 70% of infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis. The emphasis of hospital treatment is to ensure adequate hydration and oxygenation. Other than supplemental oxygen, little in the way of pharmacological treatment has been demonstrated to alter the course of the illness or the risk of wheezing in the months following bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is the commonest reason for admission to hospital in the first 6 months of life. 1,2 It describes a clinical syndrome of cough, tachypnoea, feeding difficulties and inspiratory crackles on chest auscultation. Wheezing may be associated but is not an essential feature of the illness. The upper age for bronchiolitis is limited to 12 months of age in the majority of the Australasian and English reports. However, European and North American publications often consider the diagnosis up to the age of 3 years and often define bronchiolitis as a wheezing illness, which leads to difficulties in comparing international studies. While many viruses may give rise to the clinical syndrome of bronchiolitis, respiratory syncytial virus RSV is most frequently implicated in hospitalised cohorts of infants. 1-3 Treatment is predominantly symptomatic, with an emphasis on maintaining adequate hydration and providing supplemental oxygen in moderate to severe cases that are associated with significant hypoxaemia. 3 A range of pharmacological treatments have been advocated in the acute settings, but most have not shown consistent benefit. Bronchiolitis that is severe enough to require hospitalisation is associated with an increased subsequent risk of recurrent wheeze in early to middle childhood, but evidence suggests this is because RSV infection is more severe in children with an underlying predisposition to asthma rather than RSV causing asthma. 1,3,4",

RSV can be detected in about 70% of cases, but other viruses causing an identical clinical picture include rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, influenza viruses, enteroviruses, human coronaviruses and human bocaviruses. 5, 6 RSV infection is near universal (95%) by age 2 years, and 40% of children infected by 12 months of age develop clinical bronchiolitis. 7 RSV can be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by immunofluorescence, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. RSV detection is useful for cohorting patients in hospital to prevent nosocomial infection and, perhaps, to reduce antibiotic use, but is not essential for the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. It has been suggested that dual viral infections and higher RSV viral load are associated with increased severity, but this has not been a consistent finding. 6, [8] [9] [10] ",
