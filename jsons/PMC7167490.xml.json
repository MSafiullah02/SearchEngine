Figure 1 presents an optimum model of telemedicine that could aid medical and social management during an outbreak.2.The more patients referred to healthcare facilities, the more HCWs are at risk of being infected. Also, most referrals are unnecessary and merely increase the load on the healthcare system. Furthermore, people referred to hospitals are at an incredibly higher risk of infection. More than 40% of the infections are assumed to be hospital related, though they should be quite simple to prevent (Fig. 1).73.In affected regions, most healthcare facilities are dedicated to the management of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, noncritical patients (like patients with chronic and metabolic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) have a lower priority. As a result of self-isolating, these people, mostly the older adults, cannot attend the healthcare units. A remote follow up and visit of these patients could prevent the consequences of poorly controlling the diseases.4.During a worldwide health emergency, some people with less mobility (ie, disabled patients) may not even be able to access the nearest local care center. Telehealth can facilitate assistance in their location while simultaneously providing clinicians instant access to their medical records.5.In many countries, medical schools and universities are among the closed establishments. The duration of this shutdown is unknown, and medical education should be continued through the online and virtual classes. Medical conferences and gatherings could be scheduled likewise.6.Proper use of popular social networks could significantly aid in prevention by effectively educating the populace.7.Using a referral system based on telehealth can provide immediate access to medical records of infected patients. These records could be analyzed to identify the cluster \u201chot spots.\u201d88.Developing a network could help clinicians discuss special cases and share the latest findings and their evidence-based experiences regarding the daily advances and findings related to the disease. The network provides an advantage during health crises by enabling rapid and efficient responses.\n",

In developing countries, the primary obstacle is most likely the implementation of new technology (eg, high-speed internet), and in developed countries, the most concerning matter is the need for new behavioral patterns and how to develop them. The essentials are easy to implement, and with advantages such as improved investigations, disease control, clinical case management, and information enhancement, societies can benefit from the telehealth method. In outbreaks, it is important to rapidly increase treatment units, to expand their reach through telehealth, and to develop and disseminate appropriate treatment methods for communities, and a great demand for support and assistance is expected. Such interventions using telehealth could eventually connect all healthcare personnel across the world, which could be very beneficial during a pandemic. At this point, telehealth and telemedicine comprise one of the few reliable strategies that could intervene when the classical system of healthcare becomes ineffective.",
