Using a trauma-informed model and evidence from infection control in other shelter settings, a group of senior baccalaureate students developed a program in a short-term shelter for commercially sexually exploited individuals that included a written infection control manual, policies and procedures, and staff training. This partnership between academia and a nonprofit agency was an experiential service learning project in the domain of public health nursing, allowing students the opportunity to apply evidence toward a sustainable intervention for the agency.",

However, domestic sex trafficking is happening in communities all over the United States; currently more U.S. citizens are sex trafficking victims within the US than foreign nationals (Hornor, 2015) . While not possible to get an accurate number of exploited individuals, estimates suggest sex trafficking to victimize between 100,000 and 300,000 minors in the United States annually (Titchen et al., 2015) . The International Labor Organization suggests human trafficking to be a $32 billion per year industry, with twice as many people trafficked today as during the African slave trade (Dovydaitis, 2010) . In Seattle, hundreds of people are sold each night for sex; many of them are minors (Real Escape from the Sex Trade, 2015). In a 2014 Arizona State University study, 6,800 unique buyers soliciting sex in the Seattle area were identified on a single web site over a 24-hr period (Real Escape from the Sex Trade, 2017).",

The team of students experienced working with a vulnerable population and translating evidence into a sustainable intervention. Students learned new skills as this population-based nursing intervention was developed while keeping in mind the delicate balance between infection control principles and trauma-informed care. The community agency received education and tools to keep their guests, staff, and volunteers safer from the spread of infection. Such partnerships are an effective way to meet baccalaureate nursing learning objectives in a way meaningful for students and to engage the local community with higher education.",

The Service Learning course paired small groups of senior students in their final quarter of nursing school with nonprofit agencies serving marginalized populations where, over the 10-week partnership, students developed an evidence-based, sustainable project of the agency's choosing. The REST staff asked the team to develop a plan that would keep both themselves, the shelter and drop-in guests healthy by reducing the spread of infections. Because infectious diseases can be highly stigmatizing in this population, the students' goal was to design an infection control program that allowed for the sensitive treatment of guests (International Organization for Migration, 2009).",

The team provided REST with a small supply of donated gowns and masks with face shields to add to their existing supply of gloves. Proper PPE use was demonstrated step-by-step for members of the staff present at the training session. In addition, a glow-in-the-dark lotion, GloGerm \u00ae , provided a visual/tactile representation of how pathogens remain on hands despite the use of PPE and hand hygiene. Throughout the staff training, the students discussed the importance of considering individuals' need for comfort and inclusion while ill and balancing those needs with infection prevention.
