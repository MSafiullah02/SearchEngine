            "text": "Background: Rhabdoviridae is one of the most ecologically diverse families of RNA viruses which can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats implemented in North Italy. Methods: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of 635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic protocol. Results: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5\u2032). The genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76 bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV positive bats. Conclusions: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated.",

Rhabdoviruses have a wide geographic distribution and can infect a wide range of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Furthermore, it can infect arthropods, which may act as vectors for the viral transmission [1, 2] . The non-segmented single stranded RNA genome of [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Kb is packaged within the distinct bulletshaped viral particles (with envelope). This genome comprises the genes encoding for five structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the large protein (L, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), which is the most highly conserved protein. The genome of rhabdoviruses may also contain additional ORFs encoding putative proteins, which have mostly unknown functions [1, 2] .",

Total RNA was extracted from the tissue samples and the cell culture supernatants using Qiazol\u00ae, following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR assay was performed with the QIAGEN\u00ae OneStep RT-PCR master mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The reaction mixture contained 0.6 \u03bcM of sense and antisense primer and 5 \u03bcl of the RNA template in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl. PCR conditions were optimized using the bats' organs and cell culture samples, which were known to be positive and negative for VAPV infections. The thermal cycling conditions consisted of 30 min at 50\u00b0C for reverse transcription, 15 min at 95\u00b0C for the initial enzyme activation and 7 touchdown thermal cycles (94\u00b0C for 30 s; from 63\u00b0C to 54\u00b0C for 45 s; and 72\u00b0C for 45 s). This was followed by 35 thermal cycles (94\u00b0C for 30 s; 54\u00b0C for 45 s; and 72\u00b0C for 45 s), with a final elongation step of 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Amplicons were visualized on 2% agarose electrophoretic gels, which were stained with EuroSafe Fluorescent Nucleic Acid Stain (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) used at a 1\u00d7 concentration. The RT-PCR here developed was subsequently used to further asses the circulation of VAPV especially among bats originating from the same area and almost same period, with particular attention for individual possibly exposed to the virus as admitted to the same rescue center of the control case. A subset of samples from 76 bats (lungs, hearth, kidney, brain and intestines) were preliminary selected and screened, including 32 Pipistrellus kuhlii, 2 Plecotus auritus, 30 Hypsugo savii and 12 nonidentified bats of the genus Pipistrellus.",

One of the possible reason of a such low rate of detection and cell culture isolation could be the lack of vitality of Rhabdoviruses, which are well-known to poorly resist in not very fresh and well preserved samples. However, the preliminary screening by the VAPV- Even if the geographical and host range of VAPV is still to be defined, the identification of P. kuhlii as a potential reservoir for new viral agents, such as VAPV, could represent a significant eco-epidemiological information since this is the most common bat species in the Italian urban areas. Moreover, in the last decades, P. kuhlii has showed an extraordinary range expansion due to its ecological flexibility and capability to successfully exploit human settlements, roosting in buildings and foraging in streetlamps [30] . Therefore, the knowledge of the high biodiversity of bats, the broad geographical distribution and the genetic diversity of bat-associated viruses is crucial for a comprehensive study from which viral discovery studies, viral disease prevention and biological conservation issues can benefit.",
