While transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, the gut may also contribute toward the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (1). SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the gastrointestinal tract and stool samples from patients (2\u20134), and in sewage systems (5). Coronaviruses, including SARS-Cov-2 can invade enterocytes, thereby acting as a reservoir for the virus (4). Indeed, large clinical studies from China indicate that gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19, and are associated with disease severity (3, 4).",

A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs including 3,720 adults and children reported a 2-fold lower risk of developing upper RTI in subjects taking probiotics, and a small but significant reduction in disease severity in those infected. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study of 479 adults showed that Lactobacillus gasseri PA 16/8, Bifidobacterium longum SP 07/3, and Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5 with vitamins and minerals lowered not only the duration of common cold episodes but also days with fever (16). The impact of probiotics on prevention of upper RTIs caused by specific viruses has also been documented. An RCT including 94 preterm infants showed that galacto-oligosaccharide and polydextrose prebiotic mixture (1:1), or probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG given between 3 and 60 days of life lowered the incidence of clinically defined virus-associated RTI by 2- to 3-fold compared to placebo (17). The incidence of rhinovirus-associated episodes, which comprised 80% of all RTIs in this study, was also strongly reduced with probiotics or prebiotics. The incidence of influenza RTI was reduced following consumption of Lactobacillus brevis in an open label study of 1,783 school children (18). Pertinent to the pandemic affecting adults more than children, these positive findings were confirmed in an RCT that included 27 elderly subjects receiving Bifidobacterium longum or placebo (19). Furthermore, lactic acid bacteria, from which many probiotics are selected, are part of the upper respiratory tract microbiota in healthy people, and some strains are being considered for prevention of recurrent otitis media (20, 21). This makes their use for contributing to slow down progression of the coronavirus pandemic worthy of consideration.",

            "text": "Mechanisms that might explain clinical success of probiotics include enhancement of the intestinal epithelial barrier, competition with pathogens for nutrients and adhesion to the intestinal epithelium, production of anti-microbial substances and modulation of the host immune system (28). An RCT of 55 infants showed that enteral supplementation with a combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus reduced the incidence of diarrhea and shedding of rotaviruses (29), an effect that has been confirmed in subsequent studies (30). This would indicate interference with viral entry into cells and/or inhibition of viral replication in the intestine. While this mechanism may have a role in reducing dissemination of coronavirus via the gut, the probiotic strains were not administered to the respiratory tract. So, direct inhibition may appear impossible at this site. Having said that, lungs have their own microbiota and a gut-lung connection has been described whereby host-microbe, microbe-microbe and immune interactions can influence the course of respiratory diseases (31). RTIs such as influenza are associated with an imbalance in the microbial communities of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (32, 33). This dysbiosis may alter subsequent immune function and predispose to secondary bacterial infection. As reports from China indicate that COVID-19 might be associated with intestinal dysbiosis causing inflammation and poorer response to pathogens (34, 35), the case exists for probiotic strains that restore gut homeostasis (36). It is feasible that orally administered probiotic strains could further influence this gut-lung axis, as some can migrate from the gut to distant sites, such as the breast to treat mastitis (37).",

            "text": "The gut microbiome has a critical impact on systemic immune responses, and immune responses at distant mucosal sites, including the lungs (38, 39). Administration of certain bifidobacteria or lactobacilli has beneficial impact on influenza virus clearance from the respiratory tract (39, 40). Probiotic strains improve levels of type I interferons, increase the number and activity of antigen presenting cells, NK cells, T cells, as well as the levels of systemic and mucosal specific antibodies in the lungs (16, 19, 39). There is also evidence that probiotic strains modify the dynamic balance between proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines that allow viral clearance while minimizing immune response-mediated damage to the lungs. This might be particularly relevant to prevent ARDS, a major complication of COVID-19. An RCT with Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 showed suppression of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) in middle-aged adults, and enhancement of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) in young adults, along with reduced plasma peroxidation and oxidative stress levels (25). Given the cytokine storm that appears to occur in many COVID-19 patients, this type of modulation may prove to be very important. The manner in which orally administered probiotic strains contributes to this appears to involve the immune response emanating from the intestine, a focal point of the body's defenses. Therefore, probiotic strains documented to enhance the integrity of tight junctions, for example through increasing butyrate, a fuel for colonocytes could theoretically reduce SARS-Cov-2 invasion.",

Furthermore, patients are dying from secondary bacterial infections. A recent study in mice has shown that oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus CMCC878, started 24 h after pulmonary inoculation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus reduced bacterial load in the lungs, and decreased lung damage and systemic inflammation (46).",

Rather than consider intensive care patients too ill to receive probiotic and prebiotic therapy, RCTs of probiotics for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia provide a reason to consider them (22, 23, 26). Moreover, in an RCT of 65 critically ill, mechanically ventilated, multiple trauma patients, the synbiotic Pediococcus pentosaceus 5-33:3, Leuconostoc mesenteroides 32-77:1, L. paracasei ssp. paracasei 19, L. plantarum 2,362 plus inulin, oat bran, pectin, and resistant starch resulted in reduced rate of infections, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, days of stay in the intensive care unit, days under mechanical ventilation, and mortality (27).",
