The true wild boars were indigenous to Europe and Asia and are the ancestor to the domestic pig with which it shares the same scientific name, Sus scrofa. Wild boars can also survive in temperate climates and have been introduced to the Americas and many islands. Because of the close genetic relationship, in many areas they have interbred with domestic pigs and formed considerable populations of feral suids that represent wild boar and feral pig crosses.",

High densities and gregarious behavior increase the chance of disease transmission. Many wild boar populations have overlapping ranges with commercial swine operations, which increases the risk for transmission among these groups. Within the Suidae, the Togian Island babirusa, pygmy hog, Visayan warty pig, and the Javan warty pig are listed as endangered or critically endangered. Within the Tayassuidae, only the Chacoan peccary is endangered. For all suids, hunting, habitat loss, and hybridization are important threats to conservation.",

Placentation is diffuse, epitheliochorial and in warthogs the villi are short and blunt. (www.placentation.ucsd.edu). The dental formula is variable (I 1-3/3, C 1/1, P 2-4/2-4, M 3/3) (Sutherland-Smith, 2015). Desert warthogs lack upper incisors. In babirusa, the canine tusks erupt dorsally curving caudally (Fig. 8.1\n). In rare cases, when they do not have the opportunity to grind them down, the tusks can pierce the skin and grow into the skull. Most suids are omnivores and diet varies with local availability, for example, including cactus in the diets of some peccaries. Most suids have a simple stomach similar to the domestic pig. Babirusa has an enlarged stomach with a diverticulum lined by mucus glands for fermentation; reduced fermentation occurs in the large colon. Peccaries have a four-chambered stomach with three nonglandular and one glandular stomach. Peccaries lack a gall bladder (Gottdenker and Bodmer, 2004). Along the dorsum cranial to the tail base, peccaries have prominent scent gland. In Chacoan peccaries, prominent salivary gland papillae have been described (Sutherland-Smith, 2015).",

Arthritis is most common in joints of the distal appendicular skeleton although intervertebral disc disease also occurs. In captivity, hoof problems are also common. Periodontal disease can also occur and primarily affects the cheek teeth. Studies of wild red river hog and warthog skulls noted an increase in prevalence of periodontal disease with age in red river hogs but not warthogs, presumably due to their more abrasive diet (Woodall, 1989). Polycystic kidney disease has also been reported in peccaries and is presumed to be acquired rather than genetic (Batista et al., 2014). Similar to domestic species, cystic endometrial hyperplasia (Fig. 8.3\n) can develop in nondomestic suids (Thompson et al., 2015). Cyst epithelium lacks vacuoles typical of progesterone stimulation, thus the pathogenesis is presumed similar to that of domestic pigs where cystic endometrial hyperplasia is associated with prolonged estrogen stimulation (endogenous or exogenous).\n",

A sylvatic cycle involving wild suids and soft ticks of the Ornithodorus moubata complex has been established in East and Southern Africa, and possibly the Indian Ocean region (Jori et al., 2013). However, the tick/warthog sylvatic cycle is questionable in other regions of Africa where the disease is also endemic (Guinat et al., 2016, Jori and Bastos, 2009, Jori et al., 2013). Warthogs are susceptible to infection but do not develop clinical signs of disease (Kleiboeker and Scoles, 2001). The majority of warthogs are infected during the first few weeks of life and develop a generalized viremia, sufficient to infect ticks that feed on them. The virus then remains in high numbers for a limited period in systemic lymph nodes. Adult warthogs remain infected but remaining viral load is low. Ticks in warthog burrows feed on infected animals and become infected (Jori and Bastos, 2009, Jori et al., 2013). Transmission to domestic pigs in endemic areas is by tick bites; maintenance of ASFV in domestic pigs and pig to pig transmission also occurs (Guinat et al., 2016, Sanchez-Vizcaino et al., 2015).",

Natural infection is known to occur without clinical signs, and blood levels in infected bushpigs are high enough to infect both ticks and domestic pigs. However, unlike warthogs, bushpigs do not live in burrows where contact with ticks usually takes place. In Madagascar, where ASF was introduced in the late 1990s and evolved into an enzootic disease, bushpigs were sporadically infected but, to date, do not appear to play a role in maintenance and transmission of ASF (Ravamoana et al., 2010, Ravamoana et al., 2011, Roger et al., 2001). Although the frequency and prevalence of infection is lower than in warthogs, bushpigs should be considered possible reservoirs and a source of transmission of ASFV in endemic countries in east and southern Africa (Jori et al., 2013). Peccaries were not susceptible to ASFV in experimental studies (Dardiri et al., 1969).",

For instance, though ASF infection in warthogs and bushpigs in endemic regions is asymptomatic, several experimental studies suggest that the Eurasian wild boar is highly susceptible to acute disease similar to domestic pigs. Additional experimental studies demonstrated transmission occurring directly between wild boars and domestic pigs (Gabriel et al., 2011). Furthermore, infection of free-ranging wild boars and deaths caused by ASF has been observed in Russia (Gogin et al., 2013, Guinat et al., 2016). However, it is unclear whether ASFV can be sustained in these wild populations, and persistence of ASF may be self-limiting (Guinat et al., 2016, Lange et al., 2014).",

            "text": "In experimental studies, the Eurasian wild boar suffers peracute disease and 100% mortality after infection with ASFV (Blome et al., 2012, Gabriel et al., 2011). Clinical signs in boar include lethargy, depression, anorexia, diarrhea, respiratory distress, and high fever; less commonly, epistaxsis, and neurological signs may be observed. In experimental studies, boars died within 7\u20139 days postinfection regardless of age or sex (Blome et al., 2012). Lesions include acute hemorrhagic lymphadenitis, hemorrhagic gastritis, pulmonary edema, splenomegaly, petechiae, and ecchymoses (Figs. 8.6 and 8.7\n). Skin lesions have not, to date, been reported in natural or experimental disease in boar; however, because their skin is dark colored, they are difficult to assess. Domestic pigs with ASF have concurrent thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. The pathogenesis in boar is unknown but in domestic pigs both viral and host factors impact disease development (reviewed in Blome et al., 2013). In general, the monocyte/macrophage lineage is a key viral target, and subsequent production of cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 are critical to the development of disease. It is the production of these proinflammatory cytokines, rather than direct viral damage, that is associated with clinical signs and activation of endothelial cells resulting in activation of the clotting cascade as well as lymphocyte apoptosis. In more chronic infections, immune complexes may be important in the pathogenesis of vascular damage. Infection needs to be differentiated from classical swine fever infection. PCR for the p72 gene and immunofluorescent antigen detection in tissue smears offer rapid diagnostic options. Sections of tonsil, lymph node, kidney, and/or spleen as well as blood samples are the most useful for diagnosis.\n",

This disease is OIE listed and notifiable. It has been eradicated from domestic pigs in North America, New Zealand, and some countries in Europe. However, it remains an important disease in domestic pigs in other areas of the world and is a disease for which wild boars are considered reservoir hosts. Seroprevalence in wild boars varies geographically and in some regions viral infection may be endemic (K\u00f6ppel et al., 2007, Montagnaro et al., 2010, M\u00fcller et al., 2011, Ruiz-Fons et al., 2006, Vengust et al., 2006, \u017dupanc\u02c7ic\u00b4 et al., 2002). Rare seropositivity has also been noted in peccaries in the southwestern United States and SuHV-1 has been identified by PCR in postmortem samples from white-lipped and collared peccaries in Brazil (Corn et al., 1987, De Castro et al., 2014). Multiple genotypes are present in wild boar populations, some of which suggest transmission from domestic or feral pigs while others are distinct from strains found in domestic pigs inhabiting the same geographic region. Oral, nasal, and venereal shedding are suggested based on virus isolation studies with higher viral DNA loads in genital swabs (M\u00fcller et al., 2011, Romero et al., 1997). Piglets may have both anti-PrV antibodies and virus suggesting vertical transmission (Verin et al., 2014). Taken together, these findings support the importance of venereal transmission in adult boars.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of PrV infection in wild boars is incomplete as outcome of experimental infection has varied and disease has generally been milder than what is noted in domestic pigs. To what extent this is due to PrV strain factors, host adaptation or earlier maturation of CD8 T cells in wild boars is uncertain (M\u00fcller et al., 2011, Page et al., 1992). While young domestic piglets (<7 days) are highly susceptible, high mortality has not been described in similar age wild suids; disease in young wild suids may be underrepresented due to the difficulty in recovering carcasses from very young wild animals. In domestic pigs, primary replication occurs in nasal and oropharyngeal mucosa with viral latency within ganglia. Clinical disease and lesions, when described, appear to be more common and more severe in juvenile boars (4\u201318 months) than adults (Gort\u00e1zar et al., 2002, Schulze et al., 2010). Similar to domestic pigs, neurologic signs and lesions are more common in younger boars. Gross lesions in natural outbreaks include lymphadenomegaly and meningeal congestion. Histologically, nonsuppurative encephalitis with neuronal necrosis, lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffs and edema have been described (Fig. 8.8\n). Intranuclear inclusions are variably noted but virus can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence in sections of tonsil and brain. In adult domestic pigs, respiratory signs are a hallmark of PrV infection but they have not been described in natural infections in boars. Mild sneezing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis have been described after experimental infection of wild boar with strains of PrV isolated from wild boar (M\u00fcller et al., 2001). However, wild boar treated with immunosuppressant drugs develop severe pleuropneumonia as do wild boar inoculated experimentally with some domestic pig PrV strains. Further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of these varying strains in the differing hosts.",

Some populations have evidence of exposure without evidence of disease (Reiner et al., 2010a), but other populations have had histologic lesions and increased piglet mortality.

            "text": "Lesions in wild boars are similar to those described in domestic pigs and include emaciation with adipose and skeletal muscle atrophy, lymphoid depletion with sinus histiocytosis in lymph nodes (Fig. 8.9\nA) and Peyer\u2019s patches, lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia, and mild erosive enterocolitis associated with mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates (Ellis et al., 2003, Hohloch et al., 2015, Lipej et al., 2007, Schulze et al., 2003, Sofia et al., 2008, Vicente et al., 2004). Characteristic basophilic, botryoid intracytoplasmic and less common intranuclear inclusions are present within macrophages (Fig. 8.9B). Diagnosis can be confirmed by immunohistochemical labeling of PCV antigen in macrophages, lymphatic endothelial cells, and in gut associated lymphoid tissue. PCR is also available, although as the virus appears to be endemic in wild suids in some areas, identification of viral DNA may not imply causality. Furthermore, in some studies, PCV2 DNA could not be detected even in seropositive boars with histologic lesions of PMWS (Hohloch et al., 2015). Other lesions, such as hyperplasia of bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue may be due to secondary infections with Mycoplasma sp. or Pneumocystis sp. (Borba et al., 2011). Populations of boar with higher PCV2 prevalence also have higher prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis infection, and more severe and more generalized disease (Risco et al., 2013, Risco et al., 2014). However, findings in other studies have been less clear suggesting that the interaction between PCV2 infection and potential copathogens may be more complex than simply PCV2 induced immune suppression (D\u00edez-Delgado et al., 2014). In addition to boars, PCV2 has been identified by PCR in tissues from white-lipped and collared peccaries in Brazil but no lesions have been described (De Castro et al., 2014). Collared peccaries lack antibodies to PCV2 (Gerber et al., 2012); however, absence of detectable titers can be noted in domestic pigs as well and in peccaries this could be due to viral or host factors or potential geographic differences.",

The Eurasian wild boar is also susceptible and plays an important role in the transmission and epidemiology of the disease in Europe (Artois et al., 2002, Rossi et al., 2005). The wild boar is not a classic reservoir but is capable of maintaining infection over long periods of time (Artois et al., 2002). Wild African Suidae, such as the common warthog and the bushpig have been experimentally infected (Everett et al., 2011, Gers et al., 2011).",

The virus is spread by direct contact between infected animals and indirectly by contact with contaminated food, feces and carcasses. Na\u00efve populations are infected accidentally by indirect or direct contact with infected domestic pigs or wild boars (Moennig, 2015). CSF outbreaks with highly virulent strains of CSFV in small populations of wild boars can be self-limiting (Artois et al., 2002, Moennig, 2015). However, there is concern in Europe about the wild boar becoming a dangerous reservoir in large populations where CSFV tends to become endemic and persist for years (Artois et al., 2002, Moennig, 2015, Penrith et al., 2011). Animal density also plays an important role in maintenance of the virus, since a higher turnover rate increases the number of younger susceptible pigs (Moennig, 2015). A study in France supported the idea that denser populations with more young favored the persistence of CSF. Additionally, populations of wild boar occupying larger forests had a higher incidence of CSF than populations occupying smaller spaces (Rossi et al., 2005).",

Virus enters through mucous membranes, replicates in the tonsillar epithelium, and spreads to cervical lymph nodes. Acute infections of CSF cause hemorrhagic fever, but subacute, chronic and subclinical forms of the disease also occur depending on virulence of the strain and the immune response of the pig (Penrith et al., 2011). Clinically, animals with acute disease show anorexia, lethargy, fever, and leukopenia (Penrith et al., 2011, Robinson and Robinson, 2015). Hemorrhages in the periphery of lymph nodes and renal petechiae are common findings. Experimental studies in common warthogs and bushpigs demonstrated intra-species transmission (Everett et al., 2011, Gers et al., 2011). Bushpigs developed similar clinical signs and lesions as domestic pigs. Consistent lesions included necrotizing and ulcerative enteritis, suppurative rhinitis and pneumonia (Fig. 8.10\n). Renal petechiae can also be present, similar to ASFV infection (Fig. 8.10c). Histologically, affected animals also had lymphoid necrosis and depletion. Perivascular cuffs in multiple organs were observed in surviving animals. In contrast, infected warthogs may be clinically normal. Histologically, warthogs may have rare or subtle lesions consisting of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in various organs and rare perivascular cuffing (Gers et al., 2011).",

While the virus can survive within the oropharynx in persistently infected hoofstock, viral persistence has not been shown in swine. Some serologic surveys have identified seroconversion in wild boar closely related to outbreaks in livestock while others have failed to show spill-over to wild boar populations (Alexandrov et al., 2013, Elbers et al., 2003). Classic FMD lesions are cutaneous and mucosal vesicles with ulceration. Associated clinical signs depend on site. In suidae, the most common clinical sign is lameness due to vesicles and ulceration along the coronary band between the claws (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2011). Secondary bacterial infection is common. Vesicles also occur on the snout and to a lesser extent in the mouth. Disease in wild boars appears to be less severe than in domestic pigs based on experimental studies (Breithaupt et al., 2012).",

In this initial study, REBOV antigen localized to the capsular surface of lymph nodes while PRRSV was present within germinal centers. Both viruses co-localized to the lung and were associated with interstitial pneumonia and necrotic debris within alveoli. Subsequent studies have found PRRSV and REBOV coinfections in other populations of domestic pigs (Pan et al., 2014). In experimental studies in pigs, Reston EBOV replicates within internal organs and can be shed from the nasopharynx without evident clinical signs (Marsh et al., 2011); experimental infection with Zaire EBOV (ZEBOV) causes severe neutrophilic and histiocytic pneumonia and respiratory distress (Kobinger et al., 2011, Nfon et al., 2013).",

However, given the known susceptibility of domestic pigs to EBOV and the sympatric distribution of wild suids in regions where previous EBOV outbreaks have occurred, some have suggested suids as either an incidental host or potentially an important part of EBOV disease ecology. Serosurveys demonstrate wide variation in seroprevalence from 3% to 70% for REBOV (Sayama et al., 2012). REBOV can be transmitted from suids to humans and experimental studies suggest that suids can also transmit ZEBOV to nonhuman primates (Weingartl et al., 2012, Weingartl et al., 2013). Virus neutralization assays to test for ZEBOV have recently been optimized for use in swine (Pickering et al., 2017).",

Generalized lesions and mortality due to tuberculosis are low and infection usually occurs in wild boar populations in contact with livestock and wild ungulates (Keuling et al., 2013, Naranjo et al., 2008). Recent epidemiological studies show this is true for wild boar in central and northern Europe. However, the scenario differs in the Spanish Mediterranean ecosystems where evidence suggests wild boars are natural reservoirs able to maintain TB infection and transmit disease to other species (Barasona et al., 2016, Martin-Hernando et al., 2007, Naranjo et al., 2008).",

Studies show that up to one third of juvenile wild boars may become infected during the first months of life and are more likely to develop larger, generalized lesions (Barasona et al., 2016, Martin-Hernando et al., 2007). Additionally, bTB was found to be the cause of death in approximately 30% of the wild boars. The proportion of wild boars with generalized bTB lesions decreased with age as did deaths associated with bTB (Barasona et al., 2016).

B. suis biovar 1 has been detected in populations of collared peccaries in Venezuela and wild boars in Croatia. In these populations, few animals develop disease but the populations are considered an important reservoir for infection. In contrast, biovar 2 is associated with disease outbreaks in European wild boars (Godfroid et al., 2013, Lord and Lord, 1991). Disease in wild swine is similar to that in domestic swine with oral or venereal transmission followed by lymphadenitis and bacteremia. Granulomatous lesions with central coagulative necrosis surrounded by suppurative exudate are typical and can be found in male and female genitalia (Fig. 8.13\n), bone, joints, mammary gland, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney, bladder, and brain. Uterine lesions consist of focal to coalescent/miliary abscesses and granulomas in pregnant and nonpregnant endometrium and placenta. Histologically, uterine glands are dilated and filled with neutrophils and mucus, and there is a loss of endometrium. The fetal placenta is congested and there is multifocal to coalescing hemorrhage, edema, and a mucopurulent exudate with numerous bacteria. Aborted fetuses are usually autolyzed with serosanguinous fluid in body cavities, subcutaneous tissues, and abnormal stomach content. Vertebral lumbar osteomyelitis and fibrinopurulent synovitis are common lesions in juveniles and in chronic disease. Serological cross-reaction has been reported with Yersinia O:9, Escherichia coli O:17, and some serobiovars of Salmonella, which complicates diagnosis based solely on serology (Godfroid et al., 2013, MacMilan, 1999, Schlafer and Foster, 2016).",

Multifocal mononuclear infiltrates may be seen in the kidneys (Risco et al., 2011), and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, microthrombi as well as alveolar edema and congestion may be seen in alveolar septae. Corneal edema and panuveitis with fibrinoid vasculitis has also been described. Lesions in wild boar reported by Risco et al.

B. hyodisenteriae is a highly hemolytic bacterium, capable of causing episodes of mucohemorrhagic diarrhea with a serious impact in morbidity and mortality, and thus the economy of domestic swine herds. Information about Brachyspira infection in wild boars or in other wild suid genera is limited. Several studies in free-ranging wild boar in Sweden and Spain failed to demonstrate Brachyspira in fecal samples, which seemed to indicate that these spirochetes are not a natural part of the intestinal flora (Jacobson et al., 2005, Osorio et al., 2013, Vadillo et al., 2017). However, in one study in Spain that included 40 wild boars from several intensive growth farms, B. intermedia, B. pulli, and B. hyodysenteriae were isolated and associated with clinical disease in 3 animals (Vadillo et al., 2017). In addition to documenting infection, this study also supported the hypothesis that weakly hemolytic species, such as of B. intermedia and B. pulli have pathogenic potential in nondomestic suids. Details of the lesions in wild boar were not specified. Several species of Brachyspira, including a highly hemolytic strain of B. hyodysenteriae, have also been identified in feral pigs in Western Australia (information on associated disease or lesions has not been described) (Phillips et al., 2009).",

M. hyopneumoniae is a small bacterium that lacks a cell wall and adheres to the ciliated epithelium of large airways and to a lesser extent, the bronchioles. Most mycoplasmas contain superantigens in their cell membranes that induce polyclonal lymphoid proliferation and characteristic lymphoid aggregates adjacent to airways (Caswell and Williams, 2016). Seroprevalence of M. hyopneumoniae has been reported in wild boars in several parts of Europe, such as Switzerland, Greece, and Spain (Chiari et al., 2013, Kuhnert and Overesch, 2014, Kuhnert et al., 2011, Sibila et al., 2010, Vengust et al., 2006). Most of these studies have not associated serology with disease. However, in one comprehensive study on the prevalence of M. hyopneumoniae in wild boars in Switzerland, mild to moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic bronchointerstitial pneumonia, primarily affecting the cranioventral region of the lung, was identified (Fig. 8.15\nA) (Batista Linhares et al., 2015). Lesions were consistent with the acute and chronic stages of the disease described in domestic pigs. These include acute disease with multilobular, patchy red to dark red areas affecting less than 50% of the lungs versus more chronic lesions in which a higher percentage of the pulmonary parenchyma is affected by dark red to gray, atelectatic areas. Histologically, infected boars had hyperplastic bronchial associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) with reactive lymphoid follicles, interstitial infiltrates of plasma cells; lymphocytes and histiocytes, alveolar and bronchial neutrophilic infiltrates, and alveolar edema were also, but less commonly, seen (Fig. 8.15B). The amount of inflammation, number of neutrophils, and hyperplastic BALT increased with the chronicity. Juvenile and young adult boars are more susceptible to infection, which corresponds to serological reports of wild boars in Italy, and also to the age range of susceptibility in the domestic pig. While wild boars are frequently viewed as the reservoir for disease in domestic pigs, in this study it was instead more likely for wild boars to become infected by contact with domestic pigs. Based on this, the role of wild boars as reservoirs for M. hyopneumoniae transmission to domestic pigs is considered minor.",

The pathogenesis of C. perfringens type A in pigs is poorly understood but it is likely to be multifactorial.

In an outbreak occurring in wild boar in China, C. perfringens type A and C were isolated by serological and molecular assays, and found to be the cause of death. Gross lesions consisted of extensive hemorrhage in lungs, intestine, and inguinal lymph nodes (Li et al., 2017). Hemorrhagic enteritis associated with C. perfringens type A has also been reported in a research and breeding center for pygmy hog in Assam, India. Lesions were similar to those reported in the domestic pig (Shome et al., 2010). Hemorrhagic and necrotizing enteritis with diffuse small and large intestinal edema occurred in another adult, female pygmy hog at the Assam State Zoo, in Assam, India. Molecular assays confirmed C. perfringens type A infection (Das et al., 2008). C. perfringens type C occurs worldwide and causes necrotizing and hemorrhagic enteritis that is often fatal in domestic swine. Hallmark histologic lesions are deep mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage with emphysema in small intestine that sometimes also affects the colon. It is a primary pathogen and usually causes more severe disease in young animals.",

Coinfection with toxin producing strains of P. multocida and other bacterial pathogens are the cause of progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR) in domestic pigs and sporadic outbreaks of septicemia can occur. The disease usually affects 6\u201312 week-old pigs and causes sneezing, nasal discharge, unilateral epixtaxis, and nasal deformity (Caswell and Williams, 2016). Serovars A and D are known causes of pneumonia in weaner and finisher pigs, but are rarely primary pathogens. Predisposing factors, such as environmental conditions or coinfection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine herpesvirus 1, or other respiratory pathogens are considered necessary for disease development in domestic pigs (Caswell and Williams, 2016, Register et al., 2012). Serologic evidence of P. multocida infection without disease has been reported in peccaries (Martins Gomes de Castro et al., 2014). However, both PAR and systemic pasteurellosis have been reported in wild boars (Kaden et al., 2001, Risco et al., 2013). In cases of systemic pasteurellosis, boars were found dead with epistaxis but had no clinical signs prior death. Gross lesions consisted of subcutaneous edema in the ventral region of the neck, generalized congestion, and fibrin within the peritoneal cavity. Histologically, multiple organs were congested and multifocal hemorrhage and thrombosis were seen (Fig. 8.16\n).",

Infection causes a variety of diseases including sepsis, meningitis, polyarthritis, bronchopneumonia, and endocarditis. Over 30 serotypes are recognized, but serotypes 1 and 2 are generally of greater significance in domestic pigs. Serotype 1 infects suckling pigs and is not pathogenic for other species, while serotype 2 causes disease in weaner and feeder pigs and humans. Serotype 7 can also be zoonotic (Craig et al., 2015). Feral swine and wild boars are known carriers of several S. suis serotypes, some of which are potentially zoonotic (Baroch et al., 2015, Baums et al., 2007, S\u00e1nchez del Rey et al., 2014, Seol et al., 1998, Risco et al., 2015). Several cases of S. suis infection in hunters in contact with wild boars have occurred (Baums et al., 2007). However, not much is known about the clinical and pathological significance of infection in wild boars. A single case of fatal S. suis serotype 2 infection was reported in a wild boar in Spain. The animal was young (approximately 2 weeks old) and had suppurative bronchopneumonia and meningitis with hemorrhage (Fig. 8.17\n), which is similar to lesions that are described in domestic pigs (Risco et al., 2015). Other organs, such as the kidneys had congested vessels, microthrombi, and hemorrhages, consistent with septicemia.",

Nodular to milliary pyogranulomatous or granulomatous pneumonia is most common, but lesions may be multisystemic and involve regional lymph nodes. Microscopically, necrotic foci contain fungal spherules in different stages of maturation and are surrounded by pyogranulomatous or granulomatous inflammation that matures into organized granulomas or pyogranulomas. Intralesional basophilic, 10\u201380 \u03bcm diameter, round to oval and double contour walled spherules with multiple, round to oval, 2\u20135 \u03bcm, basophilic, PAS and GMS positive endospores supports the diagnosis. Infection has also caused a neurological-like disorder (incoordination, muscle tremors, and convulsive seizures) in the absence of gross or microscopic brain lesions in Texan Peccaries (Fowler, 1996, Lochmiller et al., 1985). High antibody titers may be suggestive of active disease. Mature sporangia may be up to 200 \u03bcm diameter, a feature that is helpful in differentiating them from blastomycosis and histoplasmosis (both are smaller fungi) (Caswell and Williams, 2016).",

Subclinical infection may be regionally common in free-ranging Suidae, and warthogs, bushpigs, red river hogs, giant forest hogs, peccaries, and wild boars are important in the epidemiology due to the preference of insect vectors to feed on them. These suid species are reservoirs for trypanosomes pathogenic to humans and domestic animals including T. congolense, T. simiae, T. suis, T. evansi, and T. brucei. Warthogs are probably the main wild reservoirs of T. simiae, which causes acute fulminating infection in domestic pigs in Africa; peccaries are important in the maintenance of T. cruzi and T. evansi in Brazil; and red river hogs are important in the epidemiology of human sleeping sickness in Africa caused by T. brucei (Claxton et al., 1992, Herrera et al., 2008, Leak, 1999, Pollock, 1982).",

In white lipped peccaries, T. evansi causes severe anemia, weight loss, and immunosuppression that predisposes to opportunistic infections. In juvenile peccaries, disseminated intravascular coagulation develops secondary to the deposition of immune complexes in the heart, liver, brain and kidneys (Herrera et al., 2008). Encephalitis due to T. suis infection has been reported in some species (Leak, 1999). Disease severity in suids is variable with T. brucei and T. congolense typically only causing mild disease, and T. suis and T. simiae often causing more clinically significant disease in suids (Pollock, 1982). Presence of sarcocysts in the myocardium with or without mild myositis and inflammation can occur with T. cruzi (Comeaux et al., 2016). Intralesional trypanosomes, hemorrhages and extravascular hemolysis may be seen in some organs. The splenic parenchyma may contain large numbers of histiocytes with marked periarteriolar sheath lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid depletion, and/or hemosiderosis due to extravascular hemolysis. Cerebral endothelial hypertrophy and intralesional organisms may also be present.",

B. trautmanni in domestic pigs and wild boars results in a chronic hemolytic disease with clinical signs including emaciation, pyrexia, anorexia, icterus, and hemoglobinurea. Gross lesions may be limited to poor body condition or emaciation, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly, with or without polycavitary effusion, and multisystemic hemorrhages. Microscopic lesions reflect hemolytic disease with hemoglobin nephrosis, and degeneration and necrosis with a pattern suggestive of hypoxia in multiple tissues. Diagnosis is based on identification of the parasite in erythrocytes.
