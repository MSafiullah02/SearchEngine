            "text": "Recent evidence indicates that the tissue renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) takes part in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis (Paizis et al., 2002, Bataller et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2005, Nabeshima et al., 2006), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is a key enzyme in RAS as it converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II mediates pivotal biological actions (by the AT1 receptor) involved in tissue repair, myofibroblast proliferation, infiltration of inflammatory cells and collagen synthesis (Bataller et al., 2000, Bataller et al., 2003b, Yoshiji et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2005). The importance of the ACE-Ang II-AT1 receptor axis in hepatic fibrosis is supported further by studies which have shown that inflammation and fibrosis in response to both CCL4 treatment and BDL (bile duct ligation) are attenuated in AT1-knockout mice (Kanno et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2005). Furthermore, systemic infusion of angiotensin II can stimulate proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells, exacerbate liver fibrosis and increase serum transaminases and endotoxin levels in BDL rat livers (Bataller et al., 2003a, Bataller et al., 2005). In almost all of the published studies, both Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Ang II receptor blocker (ARB) have been established to have beneficial effects for the attenuation of fibrosis and down-regulation of key inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis (Wei et al., 2000, Jonsson et al., 2001, Ohishi et al., 2001, Yoshiji et al., 2001).",

            "text": "More recently, the discovery of ACE2 (Donoghue et al., 2000, Tipnis et al., 2000), a homologue of ACE, has revolutionized our understanding of the RAS. It can degrade Ang II to Ang(1\u20137) and cleave Ang I to generate Ang1\u20139. Ang1\u20139 has no known effects, but is converted to Ang(1\u20137) by ACE (Rice et al., 2004).The actions of Ang(1\u20137) are mainly mediated by the G-protein-coupled receptor MAS. ACE2, together with Ang(1\u20137) and MAS, represents another axis [ACE2-Ang(1\u20137)-MAS axis] of the RAS (Santos et al., 2008). This axis can be viewed as the principal counter-regulatory mechanism for the ACE-Ang II-AT1 receptor axis. Apparently, ACE2 acts as a key regulator controlling the balance between these two axes by simultaneously diminishing Ang II and forming Ang(1\u20137). The discovery of ACE2 has stimulated investigations into the potential role of this enzyme in the prevention and treatment of diseases. In experimental models of hypertension and diabetes, the expression of tissue ACE2 is reduced, contributing to Ang II-mediated tissue injury (Crackower et al., 2002, Tikellis et al., 2003). ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which facilitates the infection of target cells (Li et al., 2003, Imai et al., 2005, Guo et al., 2008).",

However, changes in the two axes of the RAS and the ratio of ACE/ACE2 Ang II/Ang(1\u20137) and AT1/Mas have not been determined after CCL4 induced liver injury.

CCL4 metabolites react with polyunsaturated fatty acids to propagate a chain reaction leading to lipid peroxidation or bind covalently to lipids and proteins, resulting in destruction of cell membranes and also induced liver damage (Slater, 1987). The damage to liver cell membranes causes leakage of intracellular enzymes, causing serum ALT and AST to increase. Serum Alb is mainly synthesized in the liver and is held within closely defined parameter in the physiological state, but Alb synthesis decreased when liver cells are damaged. Serum ALT, AST and Alb can reflect the degree of liver injury. In our experiment, serum Alb and TP of rats were significantly decreased (P\n < 0.05) after induced by CCL4, and relative hepatic weight, serum ALT and AST activity increased significantly (P\n < 0.01). Histological observations showed that there was multifocal necrosis on the surface of liver and fibrous expansion of portal areas with portal-to-portal bridging in CCL4 group.

            "text": "A number of studies have provided evidence that RAS contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease. ACE is a key enzyme in RAS and converts Ang I to the potent vaso-constrictor Ang II that can induce endothelial cell differentiation and proliferation by AT1 receptor (Kobayashi et al., 2006). Bataller et al. (2005) reported that systemic infusion of Ang II augments hepatic fibrosis in BDL rats. Furthermore, blockade of RAS by ACE inhibitors or angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists significantly attenuates liver fibrosis in several animal models (Wei et al., 2000, Ohishi et al., 2001, Yoshiji et al., 2001, Terui et al., 2002). ACE2, a homologue of ACE, can degrade Ang II and in turn generate Ang(1\u20137), which, by binding the G protein-coupled receptor MAS, acts as the main counter-regulator of the traditional ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis. Pereira et al. found the pharmacological blockade of endogenous Ang(1\u20137) accelerated liver fibrosis (Pereira et al., 2007). Knockout of the ACE2 gene in mice aggravated liver fibrosis following bile duct ligation or chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCL4). Recombinant ACE2 attenuated experimental liver fibrosis (Oesterreicher et al., 2009).These data suggest that the ACE2-Ang(1\u20137)-Mas axis plays a protective role in hepatic fibrosis and the elevated ACE2 during hepatic injury degrades Ang II and generates Ang(1\u20137), which counterbalances the generation and multiple deleterious effects of Ang II.",

This result seems to be helpful for livers of rats, but an increase of ACE, Ang II and AT1 had already found in liver of rats from CCL4 group.

(2009). However, no work did not evaluate the relationship between AT1 and MAS mRNA levels, Ang II and Ang(1\u20137). The present study identified a positive correlation between AT1 and MAS mRNA levels, Ang II and Ang(1\u20137) in liver tissues. We consider this finding very important for elucidation of the mechanisms of interplay between ACE-Ang II-AT1axis and ACE2-Ang(1\u20137)-MAS axis and for establishing the role of ACE2-Ang(1\u20137)-MAS axis as a counter-regulator of ACE-Ang II-AT1axis.",

We assessed the association between biochemical variables and the two axes of RAS in liver tissue fibrosis. In the current study, we found that there are significant correlations between ACE (or ACE2) and ALT (or AST/TP). Hepatic Ang II (or hepatic Ang(1\u20137)) has a positive correction with AST (Table 1). The correlations between RAS and liver function indirectly support the hypothesis that RAS plays an important role in liver injury.",
