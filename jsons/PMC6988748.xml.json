In mammals, the UPR consists of three pathways each controlled by a particular sensor, inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) (Fig. 1). IRE1 exists in two isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2, this review focuses on solely IRE1 \u03b1, as the role the \u03b2 isoform in activation of the UPR and induction of PDIs during pulmonary disease is less well characterized. These three pathways work in concert to decrease the protein load of the ER while simultaneously increasing its folding capacity. If the ER stress is too pronounced, or prolonged, the UPR directs the cell towards apoptosis (10\u201312).\n",

Each of these transducers are integral membrane proteins residing in the ER membrane. Under normal conditions are held in inactive conformations by GRP78, an ER resident chaperone. Under conditions of ER stress unfolded or misfolded protein builds up within the ER lumen, GRP78 dissociates from the sensors owing to higher affinity to exposed hydrophobic residues on the unfolded proteins (11). While GRP78 is considered a master regulator of the UPR, the ER chaperone HSP47 has recently been shown as a selective regulator of the IRE1 arm of the UPR, displacing GRP78 and facilitating IRE1 oligomerization (13). Additionally, there is evidence that the individual transducers can bind unfolded protein directly (14).",

Interestingly, XBP1s and ATF6-N can form heterodimers, which further complicates signalling (20). Moreover, all three UPR pathways often involve the same proteins (10). The PERK and ATF6 pathways lead to XBP1 expression, which is then processed by IRE1. And all three pathways converge on NF-\u03baB activation, though each uses a distinct mechanism.",

Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and 4 have been shown to activate IRE1 and subsequent XBP1 maturation in macrophages (23). Notably, this XBP1 activation did not induce expression of canonical ER stress genes but was required for the continued production of proinflammatory cytokines (23). Similarly, it has been reported dendritic cells constitutively activate the IRE1 arm of the UPR in the absence of ER stress, and this activation was required for homoeostasis of CD8\u03b1+ dendritic cells (24, 25). Additionally, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species have been shown to exacerbate TLR induced activation of the UPR (26). These findings are particularly interesting as the utilization of TLRs as an alternative activation pathway would suggest that pathogens themselves or pattern-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (27) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are directly capable of activating the UPR (28).",

We have identified that various PDIs are up-regulated in allergic asthma (39, 45), and their increases correlated with the higher bronchodilator response or blood eosinophilic counts in allergic asthmatics (39, 45). Intriguingly our in-depth analysis of lung epithelial-specific knockouts of PDIA3 demonstrated that PDIA3 specifically regulate, eosinophilic and pro-fibrotic responses in lung epithelial cells by oxidizing cysteine sulphydryl (-SH) groups in eotaxin, periostin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (45). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PDIA3 facilitates -S-S- mediated oligomerization of pro-apoptotic BAK to induce intrinsic apoptosis in allergic airway disease models (45, 46). Ablation of Pdia3 specifically in lung epithelial cells attenuated, apoptotic, inflammatory and fibrotic responses in a model of allergic airway disease (45). These and other literature have led to the hypothesis that heterogeneous severe asthma could potentially be classified as an endotype of asthma (47).",

(21) demonstrated in isolated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells that IAV infection activated the IRE1 branch of the UPR but not the PERK or ATF6 branches. That same year Roberson et al. (22) showed in isolated primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells IAV infection strongly activated the ATF6 branch, but not PERK or IRE1. As indicated the models for these two studies are different which may account for the differences in UPR activation. However, one less explored difference between the two studies is the time post-viral infection in which the activation status of the UPR was explored. Hassan et al. examined UPR activation shortly after infection while Roberson et al. explored UPR activation at 24 and 48 h post-infection. This distinction may help explain the contradictory results as the two studies are examining the UPR at different points of the viral replication cycle where reproductive needs and thus utilization of host proteins may be quite different. A recent third study by Landeras-Bueno et al. (55) using chemical genomics showed IAV infection leads to the attenuation of the PERK branch of the UPR in A549 cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the previous studies, they showed no down-regulation of IRE1 or ATF6. Again, this may be due to differences in the time points examined.",

Loss of IAV replication in cells treated with siRNA against PDIA3 supported this finding, though direct results on viral proteins were not examined (22). More recently expanded siRNA screens identified PDIA1 and four in addition to PDIA3 as having a role in IAV replication (56). The authors found substantial decreases in both IAV NP and M1 protein levels as well as significant decreases in viral transcript levels following siRNA treatment. Both M1 and NP lack disulphide bonds as part of their functional conformations (57), thus it is unclear whether the examined PDIs are interacting directly with the NP or M1.",

XBP1 levels were not elevated and IRE1 activation was not explored. Intriguingly, while RSV activates the IRE1 branch of the UPR in both cell lines and isolated primary cells, IRE1 inhibits RSV replication (60). In both Ire1\u2212/\u2212 mouse, embryonic fibroblasts and A549 cells treated with an IRE1 inhibitor viral transcript and protein levels were significantly higher than in RSV infected control cells (60). Though the exact mechanism for this is unclear, it may be related to IRE1 RIDD endonuclease activity.",

It is well-established CoV can induce the UPR in culture, this UPR activation has been linked to the spike (S) protein and for certain CoV, the exact amino acid domain responsible is known (63, 64). The S protein of SARS-CoV and CoV-HKU1, both beta-coronaviruses, induce the transcription of GRP78, GRP94 and CHOP through activation of the PERK pathway in vitro (63). Cells infected with MHV-A59, a model murine CoV in the same family as SARS and MERS, show activation of all three UPR branches, though ATF6 activation is limited later in infection (62). Relative activation of UPR branches varies between individual CoV as cells infected with SARS-CoV show limited XBP1 slicing and ATF6 cleavage (65, 66). Interestingly, an in vitro study using a selective PERK inhibitor found alleviating translational repression increased the levels of viral proteins but decreased viral titers (62). This was hypothesized to be due to increased translation of host anti-viral proteins.",

(52) utilized it to explore mechanisms linking PDIs to apoptotic cell death. E64FC26 is a novel PDI inhibitor-based off of an indene moiety that acts as a pan inhibitor of numerous PDIs though the inhibitory mechanism in unclear (93). The authors found E64FC26 improved survival in a mouse model of multiple myeloma, with little adverse effects. KSC-34 is a particularly interesting inhibitor, it displays enhanced specificity towards PDIA1, which is not unusual, but KSC-34 is selective towards the N-terminal CGHC active site of the protein (92). This means KSC-34 can be used to explore specific functionalities and protein interactions of each individual active site. Additionally, the specificity of this inhibitor is encouraging in that is suggests the possibility of identifying novel inhibitors with the same level of specificity targeted towards other PDIs.",

LOC14 has been found to be neuroprotective in both cell culture and animal models and displays high stability (51). We have recently demonstrated LOC14 is also capable of inhibiting PDIA3 as well as PDIA1, and that treatment with LOC14 significantly decreased Influenza replication and the maturation of viral proteins (39). Another group has demonstrated the redox modulating effects of flavonoid compounds on PDIA3 (94). Rather than directly interacting with the active site these compounds bind to residues on the protein binding b and b\u2019 domain absent on other PDIs (94, 95). These flavonoids are interesting as they may provide a structural basis for the design of specific PDIA3 inhibitors.",

PDIs are being found to play increasingly important roles in a wide variety of conditions and cellular activities, though current techniques to elucidate their exact role remain limited. Conventional RNA interference techniques take time to ensure sufficient knockdown of a target gene and targeting multiple genes simultaneously can pose additional problems. Employing targeted inhibitors allows for rapid decreases in protein activity and could theoretically be titrated to achieve a desired activity level. We have already demonstrated the efficacy of these inhibitors by utilizing them to determine the role of PDIs in oxidative folding of influenza proteins (39), while Cole et al. (92) explored the specific role of the PDIA1 A site on protein folding and secretion. Current compounds are able to target some of the PDI family, though inhibitory action against all PDIs has yet to be explored, and highly specific inhibitors towards PDIs other than PDIA1 remain to be developed. Nonetheless, the development of increasingly specific inhibitors specifically targeted towards individual PDIs would provide an invaluable tool to determine the distinct role of unique PDIs during disease pathogenesis.",

GRP78 dissociates from the three ER stress sensors IRE1, ATF6 and PERK. Dimerization of IRE1 leads to autophosphorylation activating ribonuclease activity specific to XBP1 mRNA. This splicing generates XBP1s which is transported to the nuclease and induces the expression of UPR target genes. IRE1 phosphorylation also activates TRAF2 which directs the cell towards apoptosis through JNK signalling. IRE1 is also capable of associating into higher order structures which allow for non-specific degradation of ER associated mRNAs (RIDD). PERK dimerization leads to autophosphorylation activating kinase activity specific to eIF2a, halting protein translation. This loss of translation drives expression of ATF4 which acts as a transcription factor and induces the expression of UPR target genes. eIF2a is regenerated by GADD34. Upon dissociation of GRP78 from ATF6, ATF6 is transported to the Golgi where it is cleaved by cellular proteases to produce a transcription factor which induces the expression of UPR target genes.",
