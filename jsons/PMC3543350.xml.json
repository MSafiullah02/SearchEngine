IAV is one of the most important infectious diseases in humans\n[2]. Unlike most pathogens where exposure leads to lasting immunity in the host, IAV presents a moving antigenic target\n[3], evading specific immunity triggered by previous infections. This process, called antigenic drift, is the result of the selective fixation of mutations in the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein and to a lesser extent in the neuraminidase (NA) protein\n[4]. Variants that best escape the host immune response are thought to have a significant reproductive advantage\n[5]. Another process, called reassortment, is also considered a major force in the evolution of IAV\n[4]. It occurs when the virus acquires an HA and/or NA of a different IAV subtype (via reassortation) of one or more gene segments. This process has been in the basis of the devastating influenza pandemics that occurred several times in the last century\n[6].",

Two major models have been proposed to explain codon usage: the translational selection and the mutational models\n[12]. Codon usage bias related to translation efficiency (at two different levels: speed and accuracy) seems to be linked to local cognate isoacceptors tRNAs abundances, which in turn determine the major codon preferences\n[13]. On the other hand, discrepancies on codon usage could be due to genome compositional constraints and mutational biases\n[14].

Interestingly, when the second dimensional factor (11.1% of the total variability) was analyzed, we found that the position of each strain significantly correlated (r = 0.64, p < 0.0001) with the respective usage of the dinucleotide CpG. Besides, although the global usage of this dinucleotide is very low, we found that the correlation is due to the differential usage of CGU (Arg) and CCG (Pro) codons, since these triplets display the most extreme values on the second dimensional factor (see Additional file\n1: Table S1). Importantly, we also found that the third and the fourth dimensional factors of COA (8.7% and 5.5% of the total variability, respectively), are again mainly linked to the low usage of codons containing the dinucleotide CpG, mainly at the positions 2 and 3. Moreover, among the 16 dinucleotides, 15 are highly correlated with the first dimensional factor value in COA (Table\n2). These observations indicate that the composition of dinucleotides also plays a crucial role in the variation found in synonymous codon usage among H1N1pdm IAV ORFs.",

Marked CpG deficiency has been observed in several other RNA viruses\n[24,31-35], including H1N1pdm IAV\n[12,30].

Since species with a close genetic relationship always present a similar codon usage pattern\n[37] (see also Table\n1), the results of these studies suggests that a dynamic process occurred in the H1N1pdm strains enrolled in these studies. This is reflected in the variation of codon usage observed among them (see Figure\n2). These results suggest a balance of mutational bias and natural selection to shape codon usage in these strains, which allow the virus to explore and re-adapt its codon usage to different environments in a short period of time.",

By deoptimization of codon usage (replacing wild-type codons with codons and codon combinations whose sequences impair replication and/or expression), it might be possible to attenuate a virus\n[41]. Moreover, as the codon changes do not alter the protein sequence, the antigenicity should not differ from the wild-type virus. Besides, codon changes tend to have individually small fitness effects, so many nucleotide changes will be required to restore wild-type fitness, itself requiring 100 s or more generations\n[42-45]. This \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d strategy may provide an alternative method of attenuation\n[46]. Interestingly, it has been show that replacement of natural codons with synonymous triplets with increased frequencies of CpG gives rise to inactivation of Poliovirus infectivity\n[47]. Very recent studies revealed that this strategy can be applied to IAV\n[48].",
