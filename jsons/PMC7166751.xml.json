Previous studies have suggested that HBoV infections occur during the winter and increase in the spring and summer.15 However, HBoV mainly detected from April to July, similar to another study reported in Korea.11 This suggests that HBoV may show a regionally specific prevalence pattern. During the study period, cases of HMPV detection were relatively rare throughout the year, but were mainly identified in the spring with a high peak in April 2014. Which is similar to other reports and HRSVs were mainly detected in the fall and early winter before the IFVs epidemic.16, 17, 18 HPIVs showed different prevalence and seasonality patterns depending on the subtype. HPIV 1 circulated throughout the year and HPIV 3 was prevalent between spring and summer.

            "text": "Most of surveillance studies of infections with respiratory viruses, including HRSVs, HPIVs, HAdV, HBoV, and HMPV, have shown a predominance in infants and young children,15, 17, 19 which was confirmed in the present study. In line with previous studies, the rate of detection for HAdV was highest in young children under the age of five and peaked between the 1 and 5\u2010year age group; HCoVs, HRV, and IFVs were detected across all age groups and HCoVs were frequently detected in elderly adults.4, 8, 16, 23 IFV infection was predominant detected in children over 6 years old and peaked in the 6\u201019\u2010year\u2010old group, indicating a higher risk of infection in schools.The prevalence of respiratory virus co\u2010detection in infants and young children, in whom viral shedding in the respiratory tract is usually high, has been reported to be higher than that in adults,12, 24, 25 although the clinical symptoms associated with cases of co\u2010detection are currently unclear. Consistently, co\u2010detection was more frequent in young children and adolescents in this study. Despite the low HBoV detection rate, it showed a high (53.3%) co\u2010infection rate compared to that of the other viral agents, which is also in accordance with other studies.11, 26 This result is probably attributed to its long shedding period of HBoV containing a DNA genome. In some studies, co\u2010infections of HRSV and other viruses were found at a relatively higher incidence of nearly 40%, and multi\u2010infection cases with or without clinical differences were associated with a longer duration of hospitalization compared to cases of single infection.24, 25 However, the co\u2010detection rate for HRSV was approximately 20% in this study, its clinical relevance is uncertain. IFVs showed a relatively low co\u2010detection rate, which might be associated with its distinct seasonal prevalence and age distribution from those of the other viruses.",
