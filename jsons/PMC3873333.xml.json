            "text": "\nFlanders virus (FLAV) and Hart Park virus (HPV) are two closely-related members of the Hart Park serogroup of the family Rhabdoviridae that are maintained in mosquito\u2013passerine bird transmission cycles in the eastern and western United States, respectively (Whitney, 1964, Johnson, 1965, Kokernot et al., 1969, Crane et al., 1970, Main et al., 1979, Main, 1981). Viruses in the Hart Park serogroup were initially classified together based on antigenic cross-reactivity in complement fixation, neutralization, immunodiffusion and/or immunofluorescence assays (Boyd, 1972, Frazier and Shope, 1979). In addition to FLAV and HPV, other members in earlier classifications of the serogroup included Mosqueiro virus (MQOV), a virus first isolated in Brazil, and two African viruses, Mossuril virus (MOSV) and Kamese virus (KAMV) (Tesh et al., 1983, Calisher et al., 1989). Besides their antigenic relatedness, these five geographically disparate viruses appear to share a similar mechanism of transmission, as virus isolation data indicated that they were predominately associated with birds and/or culicine (e.g., Culex, Culiseta) mosquitoes (Karabatsos, 1985).",

These three viruses were originally isolated in Australia, and besides the serological observation that the natural host range of NGAV may include macropods, they also appear to be predominately associated with birds and culicine mosquitoes or other hematophagous insects such as Culicoides biting midges (Humphery-Smith et al., 1991, Bourhy et al., 2008, Gubala et al., 2010). Additionally, two recently described (but historically isolated) Australian viruses recovered from Culex annulirostris \u2013 Holmes Jungle virus (HOJV) and Ord River virus (ORRV) \u2013 appear to be new members of the serogroup (Gubala, 2012), as do Bangoran virus (BGNV) and Porton's virus (PORV) (Dacheux et al., 2010). Whether these twelve potential Hart Park serogroup members will eventually be designated as a new genus within the Rhabdoviridae will likely entail a more comprehensive phylogenetic analysis (such as full genome studies) of these and other unclassified rhabdoviruses of the Dimarhabdovirus supergroup.",

            "text": "FLAV is unique among the rhabdoviruses in that it purportedly contains a 19 kDa protein gene flanked on either side by putative pseudogenes (GenBank accession AH012179). No comparative sequence for HPV has previously been available. These three consecutive genes, originally termed pseudogene 1, 19 kDa protein gene, and pseudogene 2, are located between the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) genes, such that the FLAV genome is currently represented as 3\u2032-nucleoprotein(N)-P-pseudogene1-19K-pseudogene2-M-glycoprotein(G)-polymerase(L)-5\u2032 (Dietzgen et al., 2011). However, given the constraints on genome size that seem to characterize RNA viruses as a whole (Holmes, 2009), it is surprising that FLAV would apparently carry two sequences that have no functional role. As Australian Hart Park serogroup viruses (i.e., WONV and NGAV) contain three complete intact ORFs between their P and M genes (Gubala et al., 2008, Gubala et al., 2010), we sought to analyze this region in the two North American members of the serogroup, FLAV and HPV, and clarify this apparent genomic complexity. Additionally, we investigated the potential encoding of a viroporin-like small hydrophobic (SH) protein located between the G and L proteins and undertook the first comprehensive evolutionary study of a Hart Park serogroup virus by analyzing more than 100 pseudogene region sequences of FLAV isolates collected over a 50-year period.",

            "text": "Our genetic analysis of multiple FLAV isolates indicated that the two putative pseudogenes located between the P and M genes contained complete uninterrupted ORFs flanked by conserved transcriptional start (UCGUCMKUAG) and stop/polyadenylation (CU7) sequences, suggesting that they in fact encode functional proteins (GenBank accessions KF028661\u2013KF028670). The predicted proteins associated with pseudogene 1, the 19 kDa protein gene, and pseudogene 2 ORFs in FLAV were very similar in size, with lengths of 161, 165, and 160 amino acids, respectively. Similar results were found with HPV (GenBank accession KF028764), indicating both viruses had three complete ORFs between the P and M genes. Cloning of RT-PCR products generated from RNA extracted from FLAV-infected Vero cells demonstrated that polyadenylated transcripts of the two putative pseudogene sequences (as well as the 19 kDa protein gene) were being produced, again indicating that they are functional ORFs. Functionality was further supported as an analysis of the pseudogene 1, 19 kDa protein gene, and pseudogene 2 sequences of 10 FLAV isolates produced d\nN/d\nS ratios of 0.07, 0.02 and 0.09, respectively, indicative of strong selective (i.e., functional) constraints rather than the selective neutrality expected of pseudogenes (in which d\nN/d\nS ratios would tend to be a value of ~1.0). Similarly, a d\nN/d\nS of 0.07 was observed in 103 pseudogene 1 (U1) sequences (see below), again revealing strong selective constraints.",

Based on their respective molecular weights, the L (238.54 kDa), G (71.05 kDa), N (50.40 kDa), and M (25.83 kDa) proteins were identified by their approximate size in the immunoblot (Fig. 1). Although the predicted P protein (25.78 kDa) is very similar in size to the M protein, the former is known to migrate in SDS-PAGE gels at between 40 and 50 kDa (Dietzgen et al., 2011), suggesting P is the band around 40 kDa (size known from additional blots) beneath N. As the predicted molecular weights of the products of pseudogene 1, the 19 kDa protein gene, and pseudogene 2 are essentially identical to one another (18.58, 18.98, and 18.93 kDa, respectively), this suggests that the band just beneath the 20 kDa marker (which is as immunoreactive as the N or M bands) might be the co-migration of the three protein products, provided that their migration is not affected by any post-translational modifications or physiochemical differences. Similarly, the slightly larger band of ~23 kDa might represent a modified form (e.g., phosphorylated) of one of the pseudogene region proteins or an in vivo cleavage product as suggested by Boyd and Whitaker-Dowling (1988). Finally, the lowest band could represent an additional cleavage product, a faster migrating form of one of the pseudogene region proteins (e.g., the acidic pseudogene 1), or the putative SH protein, a predicted 10.37 kDa viroporin-like protein lying between the G and L genes (see below).",

Although the same or similarly-sized viral bands seen in the infected cell lysates (Fig. 1) were also present (but at a lower intensity) in purified virions by immunoblotting, they were not clearly observed in the SYPRO Ruby-stained gels, suggesting that these proteins/peptides may be incorporated into virions at low concentrations, either selectively or randomly. However, a bright band(s) approximately 10\u201320 kDa was demonstrated to be abundantly present in purified viruses and was the only distinct band(s) present beneath the putative M protein in the fluorescent gel (not shown). In-gel tryptic digestion of this band followed by nano HPLC\u2013MS/MS analysis identified peptides corresponding to both pseudogene 1 and pseudogene 2 products (\nTable 1), conclusively demonstrating that proteins of these reported pseudogenes are being expressed; whether they are normal structural components of the virus or are incorporated into particles by chance during morphogenesis is uncertain. Additionally, peptides corresponding to N, and to a lesser extent P, M, and G, were also detected (Table 1), suggesting that cleavage products of the major structural proteins may also contribute to the observed immunoreactivity in Western blots. However, the vast majority (96 M percent) of the peptides (and hence, the major component of the 10\u201320 kDa band intensity) identified in the MS/MS spectra were derived from two cellular proteins, histone H4 (~11.4 kDa) and cyclophilin A (~17.9 kDa) (Table 1), both of which have been previously identified as being incorporated into rhabdovirus virions. In vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV), cyclophilin A (a chaperone protein involved in protein folding) has been shown to bind to N and is required for VSNJV replication (Bose et al., 2003). Histone H4 has been observed in vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus particles (Moerdyk-Schauwecker et al., 2009), as well as other viruses such as retroviruses (Chertova et al., 2006, Segura et al., 2008) and coronaviruses (Neuman et al., 2008). Although contamination of chromatin on the viral surface could be the source of histone H4, the complete absence of other similarly sized core histone proteins (i.e., H2A, H2B, H3), despite the very high abundance of histone H4, suggests its incorporation into virions may be selective and that FLAV infection may entail a tentative nuclear phase as observed in other rhabdoviruses (Glodowski et al., 2002), including the related WONV (see below). Additional cellular proteins of interest found in FLAV particles (but at a much lower concentration than either histone H4 or cyclophilin A) were CD59 and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) (Table 1). CD59 is a complement regulatory protein which inhibits the membrane attack complex and has previously been found embedded in the outer membrane of a number of different viruses, thus providing a unique mechanism to avoid complement-mediated lysis (Vanderplasschen et al., 1998, Hu et al., 2010, Amet et al., 2012). Like cyclophilin A, Hsp70 is a protein chaperone that has been demonstrated to associate with N in rhabdovirus particles (Lahaye et al., 2012), and is often subverted from the host by viruses for a variety of functions (Gurer et al., 2002, Mayer, 2005, Nagy et al., 2011). The biological significance of these cellular proteins within FLAV particles and their potential role in the viral life cycle, if any, remains to be determined (e.g., Colpitts et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Based on these results, we suggest that the pseudogene 1 and 2 sequences be renamed as U1 and U3, respectively, to conform to the standard nomenclature first set forth by Gubala et al. (2008) with WONV. We also suggest that the 19 kDa protein gene be renamed as U2 for clarity among related viruses. Additionally, a putative ORF between the G and L genes in FLAV (GenBank accession KF028661), denoted as the SH ORF by Walker et al. (2011), encodes a viroporin-like protein which contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (WIGTGILGLLGFIVIK), similar to the transmembrane domain of the G protein (WISIGILIVISILIC), and a highly basic C-terminus. Although the putative SH protein (120 aa) could be translated by mechanisms such as leaky ribosomal scanning, similar to that observed with the C proteins of the vesiculoviruses (Spiropoulou and Nichol, 1993), or by ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121) to produce a G-SH polyprotein (Liston and Briedis, 1995), conserved motifs found in FLAV strongly suggest that the SH protein is expressed by coupled translation. In addition to the pentanucleotide UAAUG junction between the G and SH proteins (where UAA is the termination codon for G and AUG is the start codon for SH), which has previously been demonstrated to be a common sequence for translational termination\u2013reinitiation in a number of viruses (Horvath et al., 1990, Powell et al., 2008, Guo et al., 2009), FLAV contains sequences (motifs 1, 2, and 2\u204e) that constitute the termination upstream ribosome-binding site (TURBS) essential for coupled translation that are very similar to those seen in members of the Norovirus genus within the family Caliciviridae, as well as Influenza B virus (\nFig. 2) (Meyers, 2007, Powell, 2010). This represents the first, albeit tentative, recognition of a rhabdovirus utilizing coupled translation for protein expression and demonstrates that convergent evolution of this expression strategy has occurred in a diverse range of viral families.",

            "text": "The degree of amino acid sequence similarity between the U1\u2013U3 proteins in FLAV (\nFig. 4) and HPV was particularly evident and strongly suggests that they arose through gene duplication in an ancestral rhabdovirus, similar to that observed with WONV and suggested for FLAV (Walker et al., 2011, Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2013). Additionally, the presence of identical motifs present in U1 and U3, but not U2 (e.g., YDFVWP in WONV), is of interest, and means that the order in which duplication of the genes occurred is uncertain. Previously, gene duplication has been described in a number of other rhabdoviruses, including Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) and Adelaide River virus (ARV) (Walker et al., 1992, Wang and Walker, 1993), illustrating that this particular mechanism of virus evolution appears to have occurred multiple independent times among different members of the Rhabdoviridae, thereby facilitating the noted complexity of their genomes. As rhabdovirus genomes contain similar initiation and termination sequences within each gene, this repetitive genetic feature may facilitate the occurrence of homologous gene duplication and novel gene evolution within the family. In the case of BEFV and ARV, a nonstructural G protein (G\nNS), which lies directly downstream of the G protein, is believed to have been generated by homologous gene duplication of the G protein in an ancestral rhabdovirus (Walker et al., 1992, Wang and Walker, 1993). As the G and G\nNS proteins exhibit low levels of amino acid identity, and the G\nNS protein does not share characteristics of the G protein such as being incorporated into virions or inducing neutralizing antibodies in the host (Hertig et al., 1996, Johal et al., 2008), it is likely that G\nNS has undergone adaptive evolution and functional divergence after duplication, although its role in viral infection is unknown. While recent functional analysis of WONV has demonstrated that U3 is required for efficient viral replication, is translocated to the nucleus and modulates the host response to infection through targeting the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (Peter Walker, personal communication), it is unclear whether U1 and U2 have similar roles to U3, and whether the three proteins may act synergistically. Similarly, whether the functions of U1\u2013U3 are conserved throughout the viruses of the Hart Park serogroup remains to be determined.",

Although our phylogenetic analysis revealed a low level of evolutionary change, with the vast majority of viruses falling into a single large clade (denoted as lineage A) (\nFig. 5), the most notable result was the identification of a unique FLAV variant (termed lineage B), which demonstrated ~15% nucleotide divergence in U1 to lineage A. This variant lineage, which was first identified in 2005, appears to be localized to the lower coastal plain region of Georgia (Lowndes Co., Chatham Co.), and despite longitudinal in-state surveillance has never been found outside of this two-county area. Interestingly, both the prototypical FLAV (lineage A) and the variant (lineage B) appear to circulate sympatrically (Fig. 5), as they have been repeatedly isolated together from the same county (i.e., Lowndes) over a 6-year period (2005\u20132010). Despite such co-circulation in Georgia, it is also notable that all viruses sampled outside of Georgia fell into lineage A, as did all viruses sampled from 1961 to 1999. Although available data suggests that lineage B is transmitted primarily by the same mosquito species as other FLAV isolates (Table 2), the evolutionary factors that have driven this phylogenetic divergence in a sympatric set of viruses, such as switching to non-avian (more sedentary) hosts or to a mosquito-only cycle, are unknown and would require additional virus surveillance and serological surveying in the region. In this context, it is important to note that some Culex species (e.g., Cx. quinquefasciatus) may feed upon mammals, including dogs and humans (Niebylski and Meek, 1992, Molaei et al., 2007). Phylogeographic analysis also revealed a significant clustering (i.e., more than expected by chance alone) by both state and county of sampling (p<0.001 in both the AI and PS tests), indicative of some spatial barriers to viral gene flow.",

            "text": "Our phylogenetic analysis of the U1 sequences was also notable for the marked absence of temporal structure, which precluded a detailed analysis of rate of evolutionary change. This is apparent both from a visual inspection of the phylogeny where, for example, the oldest viruses in our sample set (from 1961 to 1974) are generally no less divergent than viruses collected more than 40 years later, and by the very weak correlation coefficient (0.11) in the regression analysis of sampling year against root-to-tip genetic distance. Importantly, multiple independent stocks of older isolates were sequenced to confirm this observation. Such a lack of temporal structure is compatible with a relatively low rate of evolutionary change in FLAV, which is in contrast both to other rhabdoviruses studied to date, in which rates of nucleotide substitution are high (in the range of 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 nucleotide substitutions site/year), as well as to a broad array of other RNA viruses (Duffy et al., 2008, Jenkins et al., 2002). The reasons underlying this very low rate of FLAV evolution and whether it is true of other Hart Park serogroup viruses clearly merit further investigation.",

This analysis utilized a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees inferred using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method available in the MrBayes package (version 3.1.2, Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) and again utilizing the GTR+\u03934 model of nucleotide substitution. For this analysis the sequences were categorized according to (a) their state of origin, and (b) their state and county of origin within the state of Georgia.",
