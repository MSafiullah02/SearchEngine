Coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and are separated into 3 groups based on genetic and antigenic characteristics [1]. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the group 3 coronaviruses along with the other avian coronaviruses, whereas coronaviruses in groups 1 and 2 produce disease in many species of mammals and in humans. Confusion around the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has lead to a proposed group 4; however, genetic studies suggest that SARS-CoV diverged from the group 2 viruses, thus a group 2b classification was suggested [2].",

Since IBV was first described by Schalk and Hawn in the 1930s, reviewed in ref. [3], many serotypes have been identified worldwide. There are currently 4 reported structural proteins associated with the IBV virion; nucleocapsid, membrane, small membrane and spike. The spike glycoprotein on the outside of the virus contains epitopes associated with serotype differences and binding of neutralizing antibodies, and it plays a role in attachment and entry into the host cell.",

These so called quasispecies are generated through genetic mutations and recombination events that occur when the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, which lacks proofreading capabilities, replicates the viral genome [6]. For SARS-CoV, non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates have been estimated to be as high as 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 4.67 \u00d7 10\u22123 per site per year, respectively [7]. Evolutionary and mutation rates for IBV in the face of vaccination were determined to be 2.5 and 1.5% per year, respectively, in the hypervariable region of the spike glycoprotein; however, in the absence of vaccines, IBV lineages appear to evolve at a much slower rate (0.3%) [8]. The group 3 coronaviruses, which exist only in avian species were found to have a relatively recent divergence date (1925) and exponential population growth [2]. In general, constant population size is associated with natural reservoirs of the virus, which remain largely asymptomatic in the host, whereas a change from constant to exponential population growth indicates emergence of a relatively new virus associated with interspecies transmission and disease [2].",

Selection ensures long-term survival of the virus at the cell, organism, and host population level, and can lead to changes in pathogenesis and emergence of new viral pathogens [9]. For economic reasons, vaccine manufacturers attempt to produce high titered (>1 \u00d7 108 embryo infectious dose50 (EID50)/ml) IBV vaccines so they can be packaged in 5000 or even 10,000 dose vials. The average IBV vaccine dose can vary but is generally approximately 1 \u00d7 104 EID50. Since the number of intra-isolate genome subpopulations are reported to increase dramatically when the virus titer increases [9], we were interested in determining if quasispecies of high titered modified live IBV vaccines contain specific spike gene mutations that undergo selection in chickens, following vaccination. In addition, we wanted to determine if molecular changes were solely the result of selection or if mutations also occur following vaccination.",

In addition, it was shown that by far, most genetic changes occur in the S1 gene during adaptation to the host [15], [16], [17]. Until now, it was not clear if mutations or selection of a more fit subpopulation was responsible for the changes observed when coronaviruses are attenuated or adapted to a particular host system [16].

Sequence ambiguities in otherwise clean sequence data can be used to identify diverse viral RNA genomes within an isolate [5]. Furthermore, the area under the peaks when two or more peaks are present at any single nucleotide position in the sequence chromatogram can be used to identify the major and minor subpopulations. Our data show differences in S1 sequence within the same vaccine serotype from different manufacturers, differences in S1 sequence between different vaccine serials from the same manufacturer, and intra-vaccine S1 differences. Differences in the S1 gene between the same vaccine serotype from different manufacturers likely reflects the source of the original virus strain used to produce the vaccine and the methods and number of passages in embryonating chicken eggs used to attenuate the virus. S1 gene differences between vaccine serials from the same manufacturer are most likely due to the generation of mutations through replication of the viral genome. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines (http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_summry.htm) for production of IBV vaccines stipulates that no more than 5 passages beyond the master seed can be used to produce the vaccine. IBV has been reported to have a 1.5% mutation rate per year, and SARS-CoV was reported to have a non-synonymous substitution rate of 1.16\u20133.30 \u00d7 10\u22123 per site per year [7], [8]. In addition, it has been reported that IBV can adapt to cell culture following as few as 2\u20135 passages and as many as 25 amino acid substitutions have been documented in the S1 gene after only 7 passages in cell culture [18], [19].

Genetic mutations as evidenced by single peaks in clean sequence data and no reversion following egg passage of reisolated viruses, were observed for Ark/A at Ser130Gly, and Ark/C at Ser130Gly and Thr323Arg. Mutations were also detected for GA/A at positions Ser221Thr and Lys479Asn. However, it should be noted that existing viral RNA species could be responsible for apparent genetic mutations if that viral RNA subpopulation was below our level of detection. The level of detection for the RT-PCR test used herein is approximately 500 template copies/ml (unpublished data). No genetic subpopulations for Conn/B at position Ser345Pro were detected in the original vaccine, however; the reisolated vaccine reverted to Ser after only 4 egg passages. This was also observed for Mass/B at positions Ser105Pro and Pro490Leu, which reverted after only 3 egg passages.

It is likely that these protector-type vaccines have a more diverse population of viruses capable of simulating a broader immune response in the host. In addition, it has been shown that viral subpopulations can work together to invade and replicate in the host [22], [23]. Thus, it seems logical that a vaccine having a more dynamic quasispecies population ought to be more efficacious than one producing fewer mutant sequences. However, molecular evolution can lead to the selection of virulent viruses as well as the emergence of new viral pathogens [9]. A largely undocumented but widely accepted phenomenon of rolling vaccine reactions in commercial chicken flocks occurs when less than 100% of the flock receives the vaccine allowing repeated transmission of the vaccine virus from vaccinated birds to unvaccinated flock-mates. The highly infectious nature of IBV combined with vaccination and re-infection of vaccine viruses in a commercial chicken flock that can contain over 20,000 birds, likely allows the virus to undergo molecular evolution. The evidence for this can be found in the multitude of variant viruses with sequences extremely similar to the vaccines used in the flocks [24].",

            "text": "In summary, it appears that high-titered IBV vaccines contain a mixture of genetic variants and vaccination of chickens results in selection of the most fit viral RNA subpopulations as well as generation of mutations. This allows rapid adaptation to the host ensuring replication and stimulation of an immune response, however; accumulating evidence also indicates that it can lead to persistence and the emergence of new viral pathogens [5], [9]. Recognizing selection and mutation of vaccine viruses in the host is important for our understanding of how vaccine viruses can potentially replicate, persist and evolve to cause disease, and applies to all modified live coronavirus vaccines including potential vaccines against the SARS-CoV. This information can also be used to develop safer, higher quality, more targeted modified live vaccines containing viral subpopulations that successfully induce an efficacious immune response.",
