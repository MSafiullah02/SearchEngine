The 3\u2032 untranslated region and lysozyme coding region of clone 7A correspond exactly to that of the cDNA from stomach (stomach 2). Due to the tendency for untranslated regions of genes to diverge after duplication, the identity between the 3\u2032 untranslated regions of the tracheal (7A) cDNA and the stomach 2 cDNA indicates that both are products of the same gene. In view of this, the substantial extension of the 5\u2032 end of the tracheal 7A cDNA beyond that of the stomach 2 cDNA (determined by primer extension to be full length) denotes the occurrence of tissue-specific RNA processing.",

            "text": "Primer extension data also show that the transcription start site of the tracheal 7A cognate mRNA is approximately 220 bp upstream of that of the stomach 2 cognate mRNA. This could occur by one of two mechanisms. First, stomach 2 and tracheal 7A cognate mRNAs may have two different transcription start sites in exon 1. If so, genomic DNA would be identical to 7A, up to and including the \u201cextra\u201d 5\u2032 sequence not present in stomach 2 cDNA. Alternatively, 7A may span an intron, with its transcription start site occurring in a previously unrecognized upstream exon. In that case, genomic DNA would correspond to 7A sequence up to a point, but diverge at the intron-exon boundary. Comparison of 7A and genomic sequences reveal that the latter is the case, since the 5\u2032 end of 7A consists of 11 bp not present in a 3 kB genomic clone spanning this region. The interface between the 11 bp and the remainder of the 7A cDNA has the general properties of a splice site. This suggests that the 7A cognate mRNA contains at least one additional exon as compared to the stomach 2 cognate mRNA. Further, the presence of a TATA box approximately 30 bp upstream of the transcription start site of stomach 2 (within the 5\u2032 untranslated region of 7A) suggests that an alternate promoter drives expression of this gene in the trachea. This promoter could mediate phenotype-specific lysozyme synthesis.",

Pursuing studies in the rat, we performed northern blots using RNA from the intestine, airways, and heart of specific pathogen-free (SPF) rats. As expected from the positive southern blot, rat RNA hybridized strongly with SMUC-41. In the SPF rats, intestinal RNA produced an intense, poly disperse signal, (maximum size 13 kb), whereas that from the airways and heart was negative.

RAM-7 encodes threonine/isoleu-cine repeats.27 Both cDNAs hybridize to airway RNA from Sendai virus-infected, SO2-exposed rats, but not to that from SPF rats. If further characterization confirms their identity as mucin cDNAs, we will use them to isolate genomic clones containing the mucin promoter.
