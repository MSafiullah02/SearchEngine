An mRNP contains a processed mRNA and a large number of associated proteins [2, 3] . The formation of an mRNP requires multiple and coordinated processes. The active gene is a crucial nuclear subdomain where synthesis, processing, and assembly of pre-mRNPs and mRNPs take place [4] . Chromatin structure, RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) transcription elongation rate, and the integrated action of a number of processing machineries will all have an impact on the formation of the pre-mRNPs and mRNPs. Pre-mRNAs exist, very rarely, if ever, as complete copies of the gene, because the processing machineries that execute capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 cleavage and polyadenylation also operate at the transcribing gene. Transcription by the RNA pol II elongation complex results in a pre-mRNA. During ongoing transcription, various proteins associate rapidly with the newly synthesized pre-mRNA. Furthermore, as a consequence of processing, defined proteins will be deposited onto the pre-mRNA at specific positions [5] [6] [7] [8] . Proteins bind to pre-mRNAs in a highly ordered assembly process. The resulting pre-mRNPs change their structure as additional RNA is added, as additional proteins associate and as processing modifies the RNA. The associated proteins are important for every aspect of the fate of an mRNP, including export, localization in the cytoplasm, engagement with the translation machinery, quality control, stability, and degradation.",

Transcription produces precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) and the active gene provides an environment in which the pre-mRNAs are processed, folded, and assembled into RNA-protein (RNP) complexes. The dynamic pre-mRNPs incorporate the growing transcript, proteins, and the processing machineries, as well as the specific protein marks left after processing that are essential for export and the cytoplasmic fate of the mRNPs. After release from the gene, the mRNPs move by diffusion within the interchromatin compartment, making up pools of mRNPs. Here, splicing and polyadenylation can be completed and the mRNPs recruit the major export receptor NXF1.

It is clear that there is a close physical and functional coupling between transcription, processing, and assembly of pre-mRNPs and mRNPs. The mRNP obtains a processed structure and a collection of proteins that will influence the downstream events. The intricate physical and functional couplings are likely to have evolved, because they enhance coordination, efficiency, and regulation of the multiple steps of gene expression (Fig. 1) . We will provide a cell biological view, focusing on the spatial and temporal aspects of formation and export of mRNPs, a perspective that is required for a In the interchromatin. c At the NPC. Processes that occur at each location are listed to the left. a The actively transcribing protein-coding gene (parallel black lines) provides an optimal environment in which RNA pol II (blue oval) produces a pre-mRNA (purple oval). During transcription, the pre-mRNA is folded and assembled with proteins (green triangle and grey square) into a pre-mRNP (purple oval). Several processing machineries (orange circle) transiently interact with the pre-mRNA, modify it, and leave protein marks at specific positions. b After release from the gene, processing can be completed and the mRNPs (purple ovals) move by diffusion within the interchromatin channel network, making up pools of gene-specific mRNPs. Additional components, for example the main export receptor NXF1, can be recruited to the mRNPs, that then become export competent (dark blue oval). Chromatin is depicted as striped areas. c mRNPs interact with the NPCs (green) that are imbedded in the nuclear membrane (parallel black lines). A majority of the interactions are non-productive and the mRNPs return into the interchromatin. If fully export competent, the mRNPs are translocated through the central channel of the NPC. The export is coupled to conformational and compositional changes of the mRNPs full understanding of the intranuclear steps of gene expression.

Compartmentalization creates microenvironments that are believed to facilitate coordination, efficiency, and regulation. The molecular mechanisms for establishing nuclear compartments are not well understood, but it has been suggested that they can be formed by either random self-organization or by an ordered assembly pathway. In addition, a so-called seeding mechanism could contribute [15, 16] . Several compartments form at sites of transcription, in a transcription-dependent manner, suggesting a role for RNA. The RNA can then nucleate the formation of the compartment. Both coding and noncoding transcripts are capable of attracting and retaining freely diffusible components from the nucleoplasmic pool [16, 17] . In vitro, interactions between RNAs and proteins can result in reversible membrane-free structures [18] .

            "text": "It is still not clear how recruitment of factors to active genes is brought about, although several mechanisms have been proposed (Fig. 2) . Many proteins and preformed complexes, for example SR proteins and snRNPs, have affinity for the nascent transcript. The binding is sometimes mediated by specific sequences in the RNA [29] [30] [31] . Other proteins and complexes bind not directly to the transcript, but in layers of interactions to already bound components [32, 33] Fig. 2 Recruitment of components for pre-mRNA processing and pre-mRNP assembly at the gene. The transcribing protein-coding gene (parallel black lines), the RNA pol II with its CTD (blue), the growing pre-mRNA (purple), processing machineries (boxes in shades of green), and various components (orange circles) are shown schematically. a-g Different pathways for recruitment of factors to the growing pre-mRNP. These pathways are briefly explained in the figure (listed to the left) such as preformation of sub complexes [35] and local recycling. The latter has been suggested for RNA pol II through coordination between transcription and 3\u2032 end processing [36, 37] . Another way of coordinating interactions between the transcript and specific proteins is via the RNA pol II elongation complex. As the 5\u2032 end of the RNA emerges from the exit tunnel, the capping enzyme, bound to the RNA pol II, is in position to rapidly cap the 5\u2032 end [38] . The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA pol II is implicated as a flexible interaction platform that helps to recruit different factors [39] . The CTD consists of many heptapeptide repeats that are phosphorylated differently during initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription. It has been shown that the RNA guanyltransferase binds to the CTD during transcription initiation [40, 41] have been shown to bind to the CTD. Presumably, the role of the CTD modifications for recruitment of processing components will be even more appreciated. Methods to couple phospho-specific CTD modifications to interactions with defined proteins using specific antibodies combined with mass spectrometry is a promising start [49] .",

One such consideration is the influence of chromatin on the transcription rate and pre-mRNA splicing [55] .

The presence of alternative binding sites in the nascent transcript can lead to competition for binding of the interacting machineries. To what extent a high transcription rate results in the presence of alternative binding sites is likely to depend on the exon-intron structure, the binding affinities, and the kinetics of processing reactions.

The folding of an RNA is functionally important and it can influence interactions with trans-acting factors and itself be influenced by such interactions. Folding can have an impact on transcription [81] and the transcription rate can have an effect on RNA folding [82] . In addition, the folding of the pre-mRNA is dynamic, for example dictated by interactions with spliceosomes and not surprisingly, and the local structure in the pre-mRNA can affect splicing [83, 84] . Throughout the life of a pre-mRNA and an mRNA, the RNA exists in the context of an RNA-protein complex and this complex is repeatedly remodelled.

Large-scale methods have broaden the identification of RNA-protein interactions, but in many cases, the functional importance of the interactions remains to be determined [29] . In general, RNA-binding proteins associate with RNAs using specific domains [30] . Several such domains have been characterized, for example the RBD (also called RRM) and the KH (hnRNP K-homology) domains. Many proteins with regulatory functions in gene expression contain multiple KH domains [86] . Other proteins involved in processes in gene expression contain one or more copies of RBDs. In fact, about 2% of the mammalian proteins contain this domain [87] . Examples include SR proteins [88] , hnRNP proteins [89] , poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [90] , and the 3\u2032-processing protein CstF-64 [91] . RBDs have a typical structure and recognize crucial nucleotides in short degenerate sequence motifs. Sequence specificity and the binding domain sequence are often conserved [92] . In vitro, the binding affinity for individual tested domains is usually low, but in the cell, affinity might be higher, because other regions of the protein or even coupling to other proteins assist. In a given protein, an RBD can be combined with other kinds of domains that perform other types of functions, for example helicase activity or mediating protein-protein contacts. Proteins can recognize common mRNA structural elements, for example the m 7 G cap [93] , the poly(A) tail [8] , and the sugar-phosphate backbone [32] . Some proteins recognize specific sequence motifs, for example the poly(A) signal, and others associate in a sequence-independent manner with either secondary or tertiary folds [31] . They can be stably bound, for example as architectural elements that help to define mRNP organization, or transiently bound, for example involved in modulating specific steps of gene expression. Proteins can also bind indirectly to the pre-mRNA and mRNA via other factors, as in the exon junction complex (EJC) [32] . It should be pointed out that pre-mRNA processing machineries operate in the context of RNA-protein complexes and many proteins bind to the pre-mRNPs and mRNPs as a consequence of pre-mRNA processing, and examples include the cap-binding complex (CBC), the EJC, and PABPN1.",

The hnRNPs are preferentially present in cell nuclei. This reflects that they can leave the mRNP before export or that they rapidly shuttle back from the cytoplasm to the nucleus or a combination of the two. Some hnRNPs can accompany the mRNP to the cytoplasm and into polysomes. When bound to pre-mRNPs, they can affect packaging and stability. It has been suggested that hnRNP C tetramers organize the pre-mRNA [96] .

The packaging of the endogenous BR1 and BR2 pre-mRNPs has been described using EM [22] . These approximately 40 kb-long pre-mRNAs, consisting mainly of exon sequences, are initially packaged into thin, 5-10 nm pre-mRNP fibers. Remodelling takes place, resulting in an approximately 20 nm thick, flexible RNP in which a thin 7 nm fibre probably is a basic structural element. The 20 nm fibre grows at its root until obtaining a length of 90 nm. At this stage, about 8 kb of the transcript is incorporated. Then, a conformational change at the tip of the 20 nm fibre results in a ribbon with a diameter of 26 nm, and subsequently, this ribbon compacts into a ringlike RNP with a final diameter of 50 nm. In contrast, in the BR3 gene, the pre-mRNA contains alternating short exons and introns throughout its length. The BR3 gene is 10.5 kb long, but because of the structurally dynamic splicing process, a full-length pre-mRNA is not present. The BR3 pre-mRNP structure is then dominated by the assembly, action, and release of spliceosomes [51] . Evidently, the exon-intron organization greatly influences the packaging of the pre-mRNPs. So far, a completely processed BR3 mRNP has not been possible to identify, and therefore, no structural information is available.",

            "text": "Intron excision requires the multicomponent spliceosome [109] . Spliceosome assembly takes place during ongoing transcription [110, 111] , evidently for a majority of pre-mRNAs [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] . Close proximity between the spliceosome, the RNA pol II, and the chromatin has been demonstrated [51]. Many studies have reported interactions between individual components of transcription and processing machineries. In most cases, these interactions, and especially their functional significance, are difficult to evaluate. We need improved methods to characterize and functionally evaluate protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions at active genes in living cells. In vivo rates for the splicing process have been reported to range from 30 s to several minutes [117] [118] [119] . Recent studies have demonstrated that the spliceosome can assemble on the pre-mRNA already when the RNA pol II has synthesized in the order of 24 nucleotides downstream a 3\u2032 splice site [120] . Efficient RNAseq methods combined with robust extraction of nascent transcripts are required for analysis of additional endogenous genes to learn the rules. Understanding the principles for constitutive splicing will be important for understanding regulation of splicing. Measurements of the precise kinetics of alternative splicing will be important to verify the molecular mechanisms involved. It will also be important to learn if and to what extent the rate of splicing can be modified. Introns are excised in an overall 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order [117, 121] , but all introns are not necessarily excised at the gene. In a population of gene-specific pre-mRNAs, some of the transcripts lose their introns in the interchromatin [111, 121] . This may be due to variation in splicing kinetics, the length of the gene [56, 111] , and alternative splicing regulation. A nascent pre-mRNP can contain more than one intron, showing that spliceosome assembly and activity do not stall the RNA pol II until an intron is excised [51] . SR proteins are characterized by having one or more RNA-binding domains and a domain rich in serine-arginine repeats [122] . SR proteins bind to many different pre-mRNAs in gene-specific combinations [100, 101] . SR protein binding is at least partly sequence specific and is essential for the splicing reaction. Their phosphorylation level is important for the recruitment to pre-mRNAs and for the splicing reaction. SR proteins are required for constitutive splicing and can influence alternative splice site choices [123] . SR proteins influence also other steps in the biogenesis of mRNPs [124, 125] . As pointed out, SR proteins, in combination with EJC core components, may compact mRNPs [102] . SR proteins remain associated with mRNPs and are important for export, serving as export adaptors for NXF1, the main mRNP export receptor. It has also been described that SR proteins regulate 3\u2032 processing of pre-mRNAs [126] , mRNA stability [127] , and translation initiation [128] .",

Interactions between the TREX components ALY/REF and THOC5 with several proteins of the 3\u2032 processing machinery indicate that TREX is important for 3\u2032 processing and possibly for release of the transcript from the gene. The cleavage reaction takes place at the gene. In the BR1 gene, microdissection revealed that a population of correctly spliced and cleaved mRNPs was present at the gene. This population had a short poly(A) tail, 10-20 adenylate residues long [136] . In the interchromatin, a switch from a distributive to a processive elongation mode of polyadenylation then took place, adding on average 100 adenylate residues. The presence of a population of mRNPs with short poly(A) tails at the gene could be due to retention of the mRNP during the initial polyadenylation reaction, possibly involving the 3\u2032 processing machinery. Moreover, it could reflect the initial distributive phase of polyadenylation observed in vitro. The length of the poly(A) tail is controlled by PABPN1 [8] . Other proteins are also involved, for example the mammalian protein Nucleophosmin 1 that is deposited onto the mRNA upstream the poly(A) signal [137] . Release of mRNPs from the gene requires splicing, cleavage at a correct polyadenylation signal, and polyadenylation [138] . The mechanism for mRNP release from the gene and the potential relationship to termination of transcription is still unclear.",

The question is what more an mRNP must contain to be export competent in the sense that it can be channelled through an NPC. An obvious answer is that each mRNP requires export adaptors and export receptors. Evolution has resulted in multiple different export adaptors and their recruitment to mRNPs is promoted by transcription and processing. The two main export receptors, NXF1 and CRM1, interact with different sets of export adaptors (Fig. 3) . Many adaptors are present in the mRNP at the time of release from the gene.",

            "text": "The TREX complex is a conserved complex that has functions in transcription elongation, mRNA export, and genome stability [157, 158] . It includes the THO complex and the helicase UAP56. UAP56 promotes spliceosome assembly and is also an EJC component. In addition, many other proteins are found in the TREX complex [158] , among these, the export adaptor ALY/REF. Recruitment of TREX to the pre-mRNP is coupled to transcription elongation, capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 end processing. The recruitment is facilitated through the association with the Ser2 phosphorylated CTD of RNA pol II [45, 159] and by the elongation Prp19 complex [160] . TREX can be recruited to the 5\u2032 UTR of the pre-mRNA, dependent on the CBP80 protein [108] and on splicing [161] . The TREX subunit ALY/REF interacts with the EJC component eIF4AIII [162] , making it likely that the EJC is involved in loading TREX onto the pre-mRNA. In yeast, ALY/REF can also interact with Pcf1, a 3\u2032 cleavage factor [163] . UAP56 is involved in recruiting ALY/REF [164] and other proteins that influence export adaptor function. The mammalian DDX39 protein is a UAP56 paralog and has overlapping functions. UAP56 has also been shown to interact with UIF, which can bind to NXF1 and thus serve as an export adaptor [165] .",

In addition, studies in yeast have shown that subunits of TREX-2 interact with the SAGA histone acetylase complex and the promoter-bound Mediator complex [170, 171] and could thereby provide a functional link, and possibly physical coupling, between transcription initiation and mRNP export through the NPC. The TREX-2 subunit GANP can interact directly with NXF1, but it is unclear whether it is a general export factor. It has been shown that GANP is involved in the selective export of specific mRNAs, including those coding for components involved in mRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis [172] . The GANP-dependent export pathway may thereby facilitate rapid changes in gene expression.",

The protein content of gene-specific mRNPs, and how this might change in the interchromatin, is essentially unknown. This is difficult to analyse, and so far, only average data for mRNP populations are available. The fact that most mRNPs cannot be structurally studied in diploid cells is further a drawback.

Fractionation of cell nuclei, followed by quantification of the catalytically active SF3b155 protein, estimated that about 20% of splicing takes place in the nucleoplasmic fraction [112] . Several other examples of post-transcriptional removal of introns have been reported [83, [176] [177] [178] . The time remaining from the synthesis of an intron until transcription termination and 3\u2032 processing influences if intron excision is completed co-or post-transcriptionally [56, 111, 121] . In a population of gene-specific pre-mRNAs, excision of a given intron can take place during transcription in most transcripts and be completed after release from the gene in the remaining transcripts [111] . This suggests that even if spliceosome assembly is initiated during transcription, the splicing reaction does not need to occur at the gene. An interesting question is, if co-transcriptional splicing requires the RNA Pol II and its CTD, how can post-transcriptional splicing do without it? Possibly, the initial steps of spliceosome assembly take place during transcription, while completion of splicing can be performed away from the gene. Clusters of granules in the interchromatin, called interchromatin granule clusters at the EM level and speckles at the light microscope level, contain high concentrations of spliceosome components [179] . The full functional significance of this compartment remains to be elucidated. Storage sites for spliceosomal components are one possibility and it is well established that SR proteins are recruited from the granule clusters to nascent pre-mRNPs and that phosphorylation regulates this recruitment [180] . Transcribing genes are often located at the surface of the granule clusters. The proximity between active genes and the granule clusters may well-facilitate spliceosomal recruitment to the nascent transcripts. Active spliceosomes have been detected in speckles [112] , suggesting that some introns are excised in this environment. During influenza A viral infection, a balance between synthesis of unspliced M1 mRNA and spliced M2 mRNA is established. The M2 mRNA seems to be generated by splicing within interchromatin granule clusters. It may be a way to ensure efficient supply of spliceosomal components. Interestingly, the viral NS1 protein in combination with a host NS1-binding protein is needed for targeting the M1 mRNAs to the speckles [181] . Synthesis of the poly(A) tail can be completed in the interchromatin. In BR genes, isolation by microdissection showed that polyadenylation is initiated at the gene and can be completed after release into the interchromatin [136] .",

Export receptors need adaptor proteins for binding to mRNPs. The majority of mRNPs uses the receptor NXF1/NXT1 heterodimer for their export [157, 196, 197] . NXF1 has an N-terminal RBD and can bind to RNA weakly, but with increased affinity in the presence of ALY/REF. It has a leucine-rich region that together with the RBD can bind to CTE motifs in viral RNAs [198] . In addition, NXF1 has a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain and a domain similar to that found in NTF2. This domain is important for several protein interactions [199] . The two latter domains can interact with FG-containing NPC proteins. NXF1 binds weakly and unspecific to mRNA, but upon recruitment via the adapter ALY/REF and THOC5, NXF1 is remodelled to expose its RBD, facilitating the binding to RNA [200] . Consistent with NXF1 binding to several export adaptors, at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, as well as within transcripts, it is likely that multiple copies of NXF1 bind to individual mRNPs. Analysis by iCLIP has demonstrated many NXF1-binding sites in close proximity to the SR protein SRSF3 [175] . NXF1 interacts with several different proteins of the NPC during the translocation process. This will be discussed below.",

This observation is in agreement with studies of single mRNPs in diploid cell nuclei where no directionality in mRNP movement has been recorded. Accordingly, inside nuclei, mRNPs move by diffusion [216] [217] [218] [219] . The movement is likely to be restricted by the chromatin and mainly taking place through the network of interchromatin channels. It has been calculated that the movement of mRNPs from the active gene to the NPC takes between 6 and 50 min in diploid nuclei [9, 220] . Different diffusion characteristics have been described for different mRNPs. Small mRNPs tend to move faster than large mRNPs [9] . Thus, a nucleus contains pools of mRNPs and the pools are of different sizes for specific mRNPs. For a specific gene, the size of such a pool is likely to be influenced by transcription, processing, and diffusion characteristics. Nuclear pools of processed mRNPs have been described for several genes and suggested to buffer the level of cytoplasmic mRNPs [221] .",

In vivo, individual BR mRNPs in the pool move irregularly by diffusion and they interact occasionally with interchromatin fibers [223] [224] [225] . Approximately equal numbers of BR mRNPs, about half the size of the interchromatin pool, are synthesized and are exported to the cytoplasm per time unit. Immune-EM analyses show that BR mRNPs associate with the export receptor CRM1 at the gene [226] , although CRM1 does not seem to be important for export of BR mRNPs. The BR mRNPs also associate with several NXF1 adaptors, for example SR proteins. However, in the interchromatin pool, only about 25% of the BR mRNPs contain NXF1 at a given moment [130] . It is, therefore, possible that BR mRNPs move around by diffusion in the interchromatin and randomly bind NXF1.",

The NPC has an eightfold ring symmetry. The core consists of a central channel positioned between a nuclear and a cytoplasmic ring. Fibrillar structures are present on both the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides. An NPC is built from about 500-1000 individual proteins belonging to the approximately 30 different types of nucleoporins (Nups). The transmembrane Nups anchor the NPC in the nuclear membrane. The structural Nups provide a scaffold for other Nups. The FG Nups contain domains with repetitive motifs of phenylalanine (F) and glycine (G) residues. The FGrich domains are flexible and disordered, and they fill the central channel of the NPC, forming a barrier. Small molecules can diffuse through the NPC, but as the size reaches approximately 5 nm in diameter and/or 30-40 kDa in mass, the permeability is restricted. The fibrillar structure on the nuclear side consists of eight fibrils attached to the nuclear ring of the core. The ends of the fibrils can interconnect, forming a basket. On the cytoplasmic side, there are eight fibril structures, making up an mRNP export interaction platform [242] .",

In the case of BR mRNPs, about 75% of the mRNPs in the interchromatin lack the NXF1 receptor [12] . It is also possible that unprocessed mRNPs can be retained, as mediated by Mlp1 in yeast [245] and Tpr in mammals [231] .

Other studies have shown that during translocation, NXF1 interacts sequentially with the FG Nups [251] . The transport of large mRNPs is facilitated if the cargo binds multiple export receptors. The exact mechanism of mRNP translocation is still unclear. Several transport models have been proposed for how export receptors (and import receptors) facilitate transport through the FG-Nup barrier. These include the selective phase, the reduction of dimensionality, and the virtual gating models [252, 253] . Extensive unfolding may be necessary for large mRNPs, such as the BR mRNPs. The reason for unfolding may be coupled to the translocation process or be dictated by space limitations of the NPC. We do not know if a conformational change is obligatory also for smaller mRNPs. Furthermore, the fact that BR mRNPs reach the cytoplasm with its 5\u2032 end first could reflect efficient assembly of polysomes already in the perinuclear compartment, in a secretory cell. It remains to be demonstrated if this polarity of translocation is valid also for mRNPs, in general. If so, it could rather reflect the translocation process.",

Other studies have shown that upon exit from the central channel, mRNPs associate with the cytoplasmic part of the NPC [254] . A recent study has described how the Nups at the cytoplasmic side are oriented inward towards the central channel [242] , presumably streamlining the passage of the mRNPs from the FG-repeats in the channel to a cytoplasmic platform. At this platform, the mRNPs are remodelled as a result of the coordinated action of the DEAD-box Here, the mRNP looses many, but not all proteins (blue hexagon and grey square). The helicase Dbp5 (light purple ovals) associated with the fibers and ATP hydrolysis are involved. In the CRM1-dependent export pathway, GTP hydrolysis is required for mRNP release helicase DDX19 (in yeast Dbp5), Gle1 (in yeast Gle), and its cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), and Nup214 (in yeast Nup159) [255] . Export factors are removed during remodelling, and eventually recycled back to the nucleus [256] . It is likely that many proteins remain bound to the mRNP. In the case of BR mRNPs, it has been demonstrated that, for example, SR, hnRNP, and Y-box proteins are not removed at this stage. The compositional and conformational change of the mRNP promotes directionality and it will prevent the mRNP from traveling back into the NPC. A deeper insight into the molecular changes in mRNP composition and where and when these changes occur in relation to NPCs and the translocation process will require high-resolution studies of endogenous mRNPs.",

Other viruses, such as influenza and Hepatitis B viruses, produce specific export adaptor proteins. These proteins recruit ALY/REF or DDX39B and TREX and subsequently NXF1 [278, 279] . Other examples of cis-acting elements present in viral mRNAs that can bind export factors are the element in type D retroviruses that directly bind NXF1 [277, 280] , and the Rev response element in HIV-1 mRNA that binds multimerized Rev proteins which, in turn, bind CRM1 [281, 282] .",

It will also be essential for diagnosis and treatment in most disciplines of medicine. It is important to continue to identify and characterize processes and the involved individual components, probably with an emphasis on multi-molecular complexes and the dynamic changes of such complexes. The most important and, at the same time, most challenging area is how everything operates in the living cell. Knowledge about the compositional and conformational dynamics of complexes and their interactions must be studied in the perspective of functional importance for endogenous genes in intact cells. This goal is demanding and exciting, and will require that new methods are developed. Such methods should be able to map the interplay within and between RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes, including the temporal and spatial dimensions. As an example, it is already evident that the pre-mRNP, the processing machineries, and the chromatin are all in very close contact. It is desirable to learn which interactions are the functionally important ones. Furthermore, we need to know more about how various components are recruited to sites of action and thereafter recycled, in the intact cell. ",
