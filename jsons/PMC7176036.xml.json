Similarly, the New England Journal of Medicine has raised the concern that the climate change will cause a significant increase in infectious disease, especially vector-borne and waterborne diseases [4]. This is due to the fact that insect vectors tend to be more active at higher temperatures. Moreover, there are also suspicions that the climate change has caused certain infectious diseases to spread into geographical areas that were previously unaffected [5].",

The evolutionary game theory is one of the techniques that can adequately describe the choice of individuals in population of interacting players with different payoffs [14]. While prevention of infectious diseases is usually achieved by increasing the number of individuals who are using prevention techniques such as vaccinating or social distances, some individuals will choose not to get vaccinated being \u201cprotected\u201d by the vaccinated population. The idea of being protected by the population of vaccinated individuals is not always effective if there are not enough vaccinated individuals or motivators to encourage individuals to get vaccinated. To illustrate, in 2015, California faced the worst Measles epidemic in the last decades because many parents declined to vaccinate their children due to vaccine side effects and by blindly relying on the other vaccinated ones to be safe [15].

The spatial game theory has been used to consider the spatial network-based structure of the population of players. In this model, in every time step, all susceptible players update their strategy for getting vaccine or not synchronously and then each of them might be infected based on its strategy and the probability of becoming infected. In order to update the strategy to get vaccine or not, different methods have been used. In the classical method of updating strategy, each player updates its strategy to the strategy of the player with the highest payoff in its neighborhood [14]. In many other studies, the Fermi function is used as a probability function to change to the strategy of a neighbor [10], [16]\u2013[18]. In this paper, a new approach in updating the strategy is used in which each susceptible player updates its strategy not just to the strategy of the neighbor with the highest payoff but also to the strategy of the number of neighbors with the highest payoffs. Thus, if there is someone vaccinated among the neighbors with the highest payoff, the player will change its strategy to get the vaccine. The sensitivity factor is a measure for the number of neighbors with the highest payoff that a player refers to in order to update its strategy. This sensitivity factor can be considered as a surrogate form of fear factor or the effect of media on making people aware of the severity of a disease. The concept of the effect of media and fear factor on individual\u2019s decision is studied in some research trying to show how it can affect the spread of infectious diseases [19]\u2013[22].",

The result of changing the percentage of initially vaccinated individuals shows that increasing the percentage of vaccinated individuals is beneficial to the society as long as the number of vaccinated is not beyond a certain percentage causing some individuals to get the benefits of living among vaccinated individuals in an immune society. As it is apparently shown in Fig. 10, the number of free riders will increase as the number of initially vaccinated increase, but it will start to decrease as the number of vaccinated increase more than 20%.

Moreover, the number of finally vaccinated individuals does not exhibit a large change for different experiments while as the number of initially vaccinated ones increases the number of individuals who decide to get vaccine decrease. This can be better seen when we plot the number of individuals who decide to get vaccine during the epidemic (Fig. 10 \u2014yellow line). This decrease in the number of voluntary vaccination can be explained by the \u201cgroup protection\u201d that more vaccinated individuals provide. In addition, the graph of infected individuals shows that as we increase the number of initially vaccinated people linearly, the number of infected people will decrease much faster. It is worth mentioning that in all the experiments for Fig. 10, the number of initially infected individuals was 5% of the population.\n",

This result is the effect of accessibility of vaccinated individuals in all cooperation groups; so, individuals can decide sooner to get vaccine confronting a disease epidemic and can also save others from being infected. Moreover, the result shows that group vaccination is less effective while there might be some vaccination not necessary for people who are not at risk of being infected, and also more initial vaccinations are needed to support this society.

These costs are the cost of infection for infected people in the group, cost of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, probable cost of being infected for susceptible people, and cost of being recovered for recovered individuals. Using the payoff of each player, individuals try to imitate the behavior of the people who are in the groups with the lowest cost or the highest payoff. The sensitivity factor is one of the parameters which is introduced to show the risk tolerance (fear) of players encouraging switching to the strategy of their neighbors. The sensitivity factor can show the number of neighbors with the highest payoffs in the candidate list of the players; so, if any vaccinated individual is in this candidate list, the player will be encouraged to get vaccinated. Although in our model, the sensitivity factor is not varying among players and is considered to be influenced by the social media, it can cause different behaviors in populations. Using this model, we can show that if the cost of vaccination is increased, players have less tendency to get vaccinated, which is a representative behavior to a real-world situation.",

This behavior is very similar to the effect of fear of being infected in the real-world epidemics. Moreover, increasing the sensitivity can be beneficial for the society as individuals react to the epidemic sooner and decide faster to get vaccine in order to save themselves and their community, but increasing the sensitivity factor too much does not lead to an optimal cost for the society. The results show that increasing the sensitivity factor to more than 5 does reduce cost while the number of free riders dose not increase and the number of vaccinated and infected individuals does not change. This behavior is the result of dissuasive effect of selecting the strategy of the neighbors who have a higher payoff than the payoff of the player itself on the candidate list.",
