As these medications are known to prolong QT interval, we analyzed serial electrocardiograms (ECG) performed in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with HCQ + AZ. 50 consecutive patients received the combination of HCQ (600mg/d for 10 days) and AZ (500mg Day 1 and 250mg daily days 2 to 5). Twelve-lead ECG were performed before treatment, at Day 3, 5 and at discharge. Median age of patients was 68 years, 55.2% were males. Main comorbidities were hypertension (37%) and diabetes (17%). Mean QTc was 408 ms at baseline and rose up to 437 ms at Day 3 and to 456 ms at Day 5. 38 patients (76 %) presented short term modifications of QTc (> 30 ms).

ABBREVATIONS: AZ = Azithromycin; ECG = electrocardiogram; HCQ = Hydroxychloroquine; IQR = interquartile range; TdP = Torsades de pointe CONTEXT Since December 2019, world has faced an emerging and pandemic COVID-19 disease, leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). As this report is submitted (mid-April 2020), 2 million people are already infected across the world, resulting in 150000 deaths. 1 Thus, there is an urgent need for both effective and safe treatments to prevent hypoxemic respiratory failure and death. 2 Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) have received intense worldwide attention. HCQ was recently associated with viral load reduction both in vitro and in infected patients, alone or combined with AZ. 3, 4 Even if clinical efficacy of HCQ +/-AZ is still under evaluation with controversial results, these agents, alone or combined, are up to now among the most largely tested and clinicians have begun to use them for compassionate reason in COVID-19 patients. 5, 6 In early April 2020, FDA has even issued an emergency use authorization for HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. 7 However, as HCQ and AZ are medications known to prolong QT interval, their large use raises concerns about the potential risk of \"torsades de pointes\" (TdP) and arrhythmic death. 8 This warning was recently pointed out by several scientific societies and national health authorities, which reinforce that such treatments given in the COVID context should be exclusively monitored at hospital level, notably in elderly population with frequent concomitant cardiac disease or electrolyte disorders (i.e., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia). [9] [10] [11] [12] The interference of HCQ on ventricular repolarization is known to be dose-dependent but significantly varies among individuals. 13-15 AZ does not usually cause significant prolongation of the QTc interval but its use in combination with HCQ could theoretically increase the risk of TdP. 16 To date, there is limited data evaluating the ECG modifications induced by the combination therapy 17 and very few in the context of COVID-19 infection. 18, 19 AIM Given the vast adoption of this regimen, we decided to analyze serial ECG's performed in patients hospitalized in our department for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with both HCQ and AZ.",

Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed on each patient before treatment, three and five days after treatment intake and the day of discharge. The treatment was not started in patients with contraindications, including hypokalemia or when the corrected QT (QTc) was > 500 ms, taking as a reference the Bazett's formula. The treatment was discontinued if there was a QTc increase of + 60 ms compared to baseline or when the QTc was > 500 ms. 20 We also paid close attention to potential drug interactions, especially those that could prolong the QTc (i.e., to prespecified QTc criteria was decided in 6 patients (12%). Of these patients, 5 normalized their QTc when treatment was stopped. One patient remained stable (500 ms) at Day 2 after withdrawal, and then was discharged. In the population where HCQ+AZ had to be interrupted, mean baseline QTc were higher than in the global population of this study (433 ms and 408 ms, respectively). No death, no clinical cardiac event or torsades de pointes were observed in this cohort.",

They confirm the need for regular cardiac monitoring even if the treatment had to be stopped in a relatively small proportion of patients (12%).

These findings are in line with our results. Interestingly, they noted that the development of acute renal failure but not baseline QTc was a strong predictor of extreme QTc prolongation. 19 More recently, Mahevas et al. performed a cohort study with 84 SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients treated with HCQ. 6 Even if the proportion of patients concomitantly receiving HCQ + AZ was not described in the study, 9.5% of patients experienced ECG modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation at a median of 4 days after its introduction. Here again, these results are in line with our findings, highlighting the additive effect, even if probably moderate, of AZ on QT modification when combined to HCQ.",

Mayo Clin Proc. 2020;95(x):xx-xx. age of patients was 68 years (interquartile range ([IQR], 53 to 81 years), 55.2% of the patients were males. History of cardiovascular disease was reported in 43% of patients; the prevalence of treated hypertension and diabetes was 37% and 17% respectively. The median interval time between symptom onset and hospital admission was 8 days (IQR, 5 to 10 days), with a majority (53.1%) of patients admitted after 5 days of symptoms onset. Pulmonary CT scan was available in 95% of patients. 54% of patients presented upon admission an extended to critical form of pulmonary lesions. Mean QTc was 408 ms ([IQR], 343 to 478 ms) at baseline and rose up to 437 ms ([IQR], 380 to 500 ms) at day 3 and to 456 ms ([IQR], 397 ms. to 518 ms) at day 5. The median QTc at day 0, day 3 and day 5 was respectively 403 ms, 430 ms and 460 ms (Fig. 1). We were able to perform an ECG on the day of discharge in 20 of these patients for whom treatment had been completed for at least 3 days. For these patients, QTc at day 5 was 460 ms ([IQR], 397 to 518 ms) and decreased to 427 ms at discharge ([IQR], 390 to 500 ms).
