The M protein resists phagocytosis by neutrophils by interfering with the complement pathway in a variety of ways including binding Factor H.[71] The hyaluronic acid capsule also plays an important role in resisting phagocytosis and the enzyme C5a peptidase limits recruitment of phagocytes.[72,73]",

These superantigens are responsible for the clinical features and high case fatality rate of STSS. The best characterized of these exotoxins is streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, although multiple other streptococcal superantigens have been identified.[74] Superantigens are immunomodulatory proteins that stimulate T cells by directly binding Class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells, B cells and macrophages) to the T-cell receptor. Superantigens bypass the antigen processing and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction that is necessary for conventional antigens presented in the binding groove of the MHC II molecule.[74\u201379] This less specific interaction leads to the stimulation of a large proportion (up to 20%) of all circulating T cells and a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from T cells and other cells of the immune system.[78] This intense inflammatory cascade is responsible for the clinical features of STSS.[80]",

Circulating emm types may acquire virulence factors that permit them to invade into sterile sites,[85,86] but host and environment factors also play an important role in susceptibility. In tropical developing countries there is a wide variety of emm types that cause invasive disease without dominant emm types such as emm1.[27,82,87] For example, in the Pacific region, 19 emm types account for 50% of invasive disease and emm1 accounts for less than 4%.[82]",

Necrotizing fasciitis may follow local blunt or penetrating trauma to the skin. It occurs most commonly in the upper limb, followed by the lower limb. In adults, necrotizing fasciitis can be associated with intravenous drug use, whilst in children, varicella is a common precipitant.[90,91] Patients with GAS-associated necrotizing fasciitis may only have subtle signs of severity at initial presentation and can therefore be difficult to differentiate from a relatively simple cellulitis. Severe pain and tenderness that is disproportionate to the physical findings is the clinical hallmark that differentiates necrotizing fasciitis from more superficial infection.[88,92] Tense oedema and the development of bullae that appear bluish as the disease progresses are also useful signs, but are often late signs and indicative of significant tissue necrosis.[93,94] The case fatality rate of GAS-associated necrotizing fasciitis is 30\u201350%,[88,90,91,93] and the majority of deaths occur in the first 48 hours after presentation, reflecting the rapidly progressive nature of the disease.[19] Between 30% and 50% of patients with GAS-associated necrotizing fasciitis develop STSS and these patients have a particularly high case fatality rate.[54,88,91]",

Fifty percent of patients have hypotension at presentation, and by 4 hours all develop hypotension.[95] The typical \u2018sunburn\u2019 type rash in STSS is widespread, erythematous, macular and blanching. Characteristically, there is subsequent desquamation about 2 weeks after the initial illness. In addition to fever and rash at presentation, there may be the presence of non-purulent conjunctivitis and mucositis. Shock is caused by the capillary leak and vasodilation resulting from the massive cytokine release induced by bacterial superantigen toxins, and, untreated, leads to hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, myocardial suppression, renal failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver function are other manifestations of STSS. Streptococcal toxic shock has been described in association with all manner of invasive GAS infections, but soft tissue infection, in particular necrotizing fasciitis, is the most common associated focus of infection.[44,94]",

Laboratory evidence in favour of the use of IVIG in STSS includes the presence of neutralizing antibodies to streptococcal superantigen toxins in IVIG.[121] In addition, plasma from patients with STSS who have been treated with IVIG can inhibit superantigen-induced T-cell proliferation and production of cytokines in vitro.[122,123] IVIG has multiple other anti-inflammatory properties and the specific mechanism underlying its potential beneficial effect in STSS is unknown. Three clinical studies have investigated the benefit of IVIG in STSS (table III).[124\u2013126] The first was an observational cohort study using historical controls that found that mortality at 30 days in patients administered IVIG was half that of control patients.[125] Of note, the case fatality rate in both groups was considerably higher than that generally seen today. A randomized controlled trial followed this study, but was ceased prematurely because of slow patient enrolment. This second study found a trend towards improved survival at 28 days in patients with STSS, but this finding was not statistically significant. A third, retrospective, study investigated outcomes in 182 children with STSS in selected parts of the US between 2003 and 2007. There was no difference in mortality between children who received IVIG (mortality 6.0%) and those who did not (mortality 2.8%; p = 0.3).[126] However, this study suffered from selection bias as a result of its retrospective design (the most unwell children received IVIG),[126] and expert commentators concluded that the available evidence still supports the use of IVIG in both adults and children with STSS.[127] The lower mortality of STSS in children compared with adults means that a randomized controlled trial of IVIG in children is unlikely to be conducted.[127] The use of IVIG needs to be weighed against its cost and potential adverse events, including immune-mediated haemolysis and anaphylaxis.[128]",

However, a biological mechanism has been proposed whereby NSAIDs inhibit the normal feedback loop of prostaglandin on the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 by macrophages, and also suppresses neutrophil function.[131] Some experts recommend therefore avoiding NSAIDs in patients with fever without a known source.[129,131] It is prudent to avoid NSAID use in patients with varicella, because of the known association between varicella infection, GAS infection and STSS, as previously outlined.[130]",

Outbreaks of invasive GAS infections within family clusters, school children and communities are well described,[138\u2013143] and these are characterized by the rapid spread of virulent clones among close contacts. Of the studies that have tried to systematically identify paired household cases, only ten pairs have been identified to date, one from the US, four from Canada and five from the UK. As such, there is a considerable margin of error in estimating secondary household risk.[44,66,144,145] In a study in Ontario, the attack rate for household contacts of patients with invasive GAS disease was 294 per 100 000 compared with the incidence of sporadic disease in the same population of 2.4 per 100 000.[44] The attack rate in a study in the US for household contacts of patients with invasive GAS disease was 66 per 100 000 compared with the incidence of sporadic disease in the same population of 3.5 per 100 000.[146] Estimation of attack rate from the UK cases was hampered by the absence of information on the number of household contacts, but on the basis of estimated household size, the increased risk ranged between 80 and 120/100 000 compared with a background risk of 3.85/100 000.[144]",

In contrast, UK guidelines have been influenced by the observation that, of the five paired cases of invasive GAS disease in the UK in 2003, three were mother-neonate pairs, and only one of the other two pairs could have been prevented (one pair presented almost simultaneously). Therefore, UK public health authorities have limited their recommendations for routine contact prophylaxis to postpartum mothers or their babies should the other develop invasive disease.[66] Of note, all three guidelines recommend treatment of close contacts if they have symptoms suggestive of localized GAS infection, that is sore throat, fever and/or skin infection. Advantages of contact prophylaxis include potentially preventing disease in contacts and transmission of virulent strains. The disadvantages include the unnecessary use of antibacterials in most contacts and the risk of side effects, including anaphylaxis.",

It is likely that there is a large burden of invasive GAS disease in many tropical developing countries, although data are lacking. The available evidence supports the need for early institution of supportive care, broad empiric antibacterial therapy until the diagnosis of GAS infection is made, the use of clindamycin because of its anti-toxin capacity, the early administration of IVIG especially if there is evidence of STSS, and debridement of necrotic tissue in cases of necrotizing fasciitis. In terms of therapeutic advances, it is unlikely that randomized controlled trials of treatment for invasive GAS infections will be conducted in the future.[124] However, large-scale observational and case control studies may provide evidence of the effectiveness of some interventions.",
