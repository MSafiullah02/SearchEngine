A resurgence of outbreaks of avian influenza (A/H5N1) has been reported recently in poultry in Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, Thailand and Hungary, as well as cases of human infection in Indonesia and China, following a period of relatively low activity. This is not unexpected, as similar trends were observed annually in 2004, 2005 and 2006 in Far East farms. The potential environmental sources are continually and intensively being monitored worldwide and thus H5N1 still poses a serious threat to public health and spreading alarm of an imminent pandemic in the West.",

The outbreaks in December and January 2006 occurred in provinces where immunisation should have been carried out, although a number of them occurred on farms that were unregistered and therefore had been missed by vaccination teams. Infections also occurred on some registered farms, either because of incomplete immunisation coverage or vaccine failure. Vaccination of domestic poultry is continuing. So far, around 2.1 million birds have been vaccinated (including approximately 0.3 million chickens and 1.8 million ducks), but full coverage has not been achieved as yet. Single outbreaks of avian influenza in domestic poultry have recently also been reported in Japan \u2013 on a chicken farm on the island of Kyushu, and in Thailand on a duck farm in Phitsanulok province, where there had been no cases of H5N1 infection since 2004 and July 2006, respectively. Other outbreaks have also been reported in South Korea (http://www.eurosurveillance.org).",

On 18 January 2007, a report by the WHO revealed that samples from these two patients had genetic markers previously observed to be associated with some reduced susceptibility of influenza viruses to oseltamivir (see WHO Report, 2007 for further details). Both patients had been on treatment with oseltamivir, but only for two days before the samples that yielded the viruses were taken. This genetic marker of resistance had previously been identified in Vietnam in one patient in 2005. These markers are not associated with any known change in the transmissibility of the virus between humans, and antiviral resistance is uncommon in Egypt, therefore the public health implications at this time are limited. Monitoring of the levels and type of antiviral resistance is important and is being carried out. An update on the epidemiology of human infection and viral ecology of avian influenza H5N1 has been recently reviewed [6]. So far in 2008, there have been 34 human cases reported from Bangladesh (1), China (3), Egypt (7), Indonesia (18) and Vietnam (5), which have accounted for 26 deaths (see Fig. 2\n).",

Despite integrated efforts in the veterinary sector in some countries (vaccination, surveillance, increased biosecurity), outbreaks of H5N1 are still occurring regularly or intermittently in poultry in China, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, where humans live in close contact with domestic animals. Furthermore, cases of H5N1 infection have been suspected or reported in birds in countries where people have close contact with poultry but the lack of effective surveillance means it is impossible to determine whether or not H5N1 is present in poultry. The fact that the H5N1 virus has been spreading since 2003, without causing the emergence of a pandemic strain, does not necessarily mean it will not do so. It is believed that the avian strain that contributed to the influenza pandemic in 1918\u20131919 was present in birds for a number of years before the pandemic emerged [7] and the origin of the 1918 flu pandemics is itself an enigma and still remains so. That is why the elimination of the H5N1 virus in domestic poultry remains crucial. Molecular technology has stepped in to seek some answers to this riddle. Molecular characterization of the H5N1 virus from poultry in Asia [8], [9] and the complete genome of human H5N1 isolates from Thailand, indicated that the virus might have adapted to allow spread more efficiently among avian species.",

Insofar as poultry houses are concerned, our group [10] has been intensively monitoring raw ingredients of mushroom composts, particularly straw and poultry litter for altogether different purposes. In the course this study comprising several strands of investigation, we found that the compost straw and poultry litter carried an unusual compendium of dsRNAs associated with mushroom virus (X) disease [11]. Hybridization and sequence analyses of such segmented RNAs have suggested that they could have arisen from more than a single virus and some of these elements could be associated with fungal hosts such as Cryphonectria spp. [12]. To elucidate the aetiology of these unknown viruses, we closely monitored farm materials and their wastes for bacteria, faecal parasites (e.g. Cryptosporidium spp.) and viruses. We found a number of novel eubacteria [13] and the occasional oocysts of cryptosporidia in mostly wet straw/compost wastes that were being processed alongside pig slurry solids and in water samples. Other workers have found similar organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n[14]. Wheat straw used in composts also contained phytopathogenic bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, some of which carried a unique dsRNA phage (phi-6), from which, we have isolated \u2018defective\u2019 virus-like particles (VLPs), by zonal centrifugation [15].",

Enteric pathogens were infrequently isolated from composted wastes [21] and faecal material from wild swans [22]. However, the test parameters, load levels and sampling regimes including timing and seasons may in future determine the true nature of the presence or absence of zoonotic pathogens. Most pathogenic bacteria have relatively short periods of persistence in different environments, such as composts, waste and the water environments (ranging from a few days to months), however it should be noted that some Salmonella spp and other zoonotic pathogens have survived nearly 20 years in soils and in lake beds [23]. Such observations have not been followed up and the viral ecology has been, by far, either an overlooked or ignored subject. For instance, many indicator pathogens for achieving sanitation in an environmental niche remain enshrined and reliant upon mainly bacterial and occasionally fungal species mortality, survival or persistence data.",

We do not know the host range, their survival and as to how host organisms would support or maintain viral ss/dsRNA in harsh environments, such as those encountered by avian flu virus. Niche/host generalist (e g. gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., etc) and specialist (viral or bacteriophage) interactions are known [26], but viral ecology and maintenance of \u201cnovel host\u201d use has been by far less investigated and scarcely understood. Since World War II we have witnessed that RNA viruses are prone to mutations during their attachment to proteins that change or expand their host ranges and may well offer, in part, a plausible explanation as to why some \u223c50 RNA viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus and several hantaviruses have shifted from non-human hosts to humans [27], [28]. Interestingly, BLASTn alignments of deduced RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) sequences of unknown ss/dsRNAs [15], that we have isolated from poultry farms, exhibit the highest similarity with RdRPs of PRD1 phage (host: Salmonella typhimurium), fowl plague virus and those of dsRNA carrying Cryptosporidium baileyi (poultry biotype). Previously, we reported on the prevalence of bacterial faecal pathogens from unseparated slurry, as well as separated solid and liquid fractions of slurry, from a commercial pig farm in Ireland [29]. In recent years, strict European Union legislation (EC no.1774/2002) has been invoked for controlling the disposal of wastes carrying animal residues in feedstuff, as well as detailing rules about food or farm wastes containing animal by-products not intended for human consumption [30].

Therefore, in a preliminary study, we re-assessed the RT-PCR screening procedures for the occurrence of viral elements, vis-\u00e0-vis, bacterial and parasitic faecal pathogens from a major watercourse in Northern Ireland frequented by migratory wild swans. The same water source, following appropriate treatment, is used for several purposes including water for farm animals, human consumption as well as for water recreational activities. Our initial assays using methods of [31] revealed that C. baileyi was present in the samples tested. Using a \u2018One-Step RT-PCR\u2019 kit and the primers described by [8], [32] for amplifications of target sequences from RNA extracts from undifferentiated water samples (incorporating parasitic oocysts), we obtained amplifications of at least three of the eight segments of influenza virus [33]. Interestingly, BLAST alignments of deduced RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) sequences exhibited highest similarity with RdRPs of PRD1 phage (host: S. typhimurium), phi-6 phage (host: Pseudomonas phaseolicola), fowl plague virus and those of dsRNA carrying C. baileyi (poultry biotype). However, it has to be stressed that none of the samples tested positive for the presence of all segments of avian influenza H5N1 [33].",

Western blot analysis revealed the association of the complexes with two different proteins, encoded by large and small segments of viral double-stranded RNAs. Each complex was found to contain only double-stranded RNA, both double- and single-stranded RNA, or only single-stranded RNA. Maximum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was observed within the complexes containing both double- and single-stranded RNAs. These complexes possessed both transcriptase and replicase polymerase activities. Virus-like particles with a diameter of 31 nm were copurified with RNA polymerase complexes, and buoyant density and polymerase studies suggest that C. parvum harbors a putative double-stranded RNA virus which separately encapsidates the large and small RNA segments. The mechanism of replication and other characteristics of this virus are similar to those of the viruses of the family Partitiviridae, previously identified only in fungi and plants.",

Avian influenza strains do not usually replicate well in humans, but they can undergo genetic re-assortment with human strains that co-infect pigs. This can result in new strains with a marked increase in virulence for humans. Wild birds can acquire enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter spp., by feeding on raw sewage and garbage, and can spread these agents to humans directly or by contaminating commercial poultry operations. Our preliminary study on poultry and pig farms has indicated the potential dangers as these animal agriculture units are in proximal distances in Ireland. Conversely, wild birds can acquire drug-resistant enteropathogens from farms (e.g. epidemiology of antibiotic resistant campylobacters, [38]) and spread these strains along migration routes. Birds contribute to the global spread of emerging infectious diseases in a manner analogous to humans travelling on aircraft. A better understanding of avian migration patterns and infectious diseases of birds would be useful in helping to predict future outbreaks of infections due to emerging zoonotic pathogens [39]. The World Health Organization considers that direct contact with infected poultry or with surfaces and objects contaminated by their faeces is the main route of human infection with H5N1. Most human cases have occurred in rural or periurban areas where many households keep small poultry flocks, which often roam freely, sometimes entering homes or sharing outdoor areas where children play. Infected birds shed large quantities of virus in their faeces, so opportunities for exposure to infected droppings or to environments contaminated by the virus are frequent in these circumstances.",
