These viruses spread primarily to vertebrates via the fecal-oral route and are associated with gastroenteritis worldwide1\u20133. Currently, the Astroviridae family is composed of 21 viral species, which are divided into two genera, the Avastrovirus genus that infects avian species, and Mamastrovirus genus that infects mammals including humans4. Avastroviruses are emerging pathogens that have been associated to cause diverse pathologies in birds, including enteritis, hepatitis, and nephritis, which have been associated with economic losses in the poultry industry (e.g., white chick disease)5\u20138. Additionally, mamastrovirus infections are characterized by gastroenteritis and in rare cases cause neurological syndromes and encephalitis1,9\u201311. Human astroviruses (HAstV) are recognized to cause childhood viral gastroenteritis worldwide, but it has only been associated with neurotropism in immunocompromised patients3,12\u201314.",

Also, they have been associated with relevant veterinary diseases, such as respiratory illnesses in cats caused by feline calicivirus, and hemorrhagic fever in rabbits18,26.

This virus was tentatively designated as Ruddy turnstone astrovirus (RtAstV). RtAstV presents a typical genome organization of astroviruses, which consists of a single-stranded positive RNA of 7,033 nucleotides (nt) composed by three open reading frames (ORFs), named ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 (Fig. 2a). The RtAstV genome was obtained by 56,329 reads with a median coverage of 3,006x (Supplementary Fig. 1). ORF1a is 3,261 nucleotides (nt) long and encoded the putative viral protease (NsP1a polyprotein), which is 1,086 amino acids (aa) long. ORF1b is 1,566 nt long, and encoded the putative RdRP protein, which is 521 aa long. We identified an overlapping region between ORF1a and ORF1b of 85 nt. ORF2 is 1,971 nt long and encodes a 656 aa long capsid precursor protein. Based on BLAST analysis, RtAstV shares 28 to 60% of amino acid identity with chicken astrovirus (GenBank No. NC_003790).",

No evidence of recombination was observed in RtAstV.

This virus was tentatively designated as Ruddy turnstone calicivirus (RTCV). RTCV has the typical genome organization of caliciviruses, with a single-stranded positive RNA of 8,127 nt, which encodes two proteins, the polyprotein (i.e., helicase, polymerase, and capsid) and the VP2 protein. The RTCV genome was obtained by 4,817 reads with a median coverage of 258x (Supplementary Fig. 2). The ORF1 polyprotein is 7,254 nt and encodes a 2,417 aa long polyprotein, which includes Helicase (Hel), Polymerase (Pol) and Capsid (CP) predicted domains. ORF2 is 687 nt long and encodes a 228 aa long viral protein 2 (VP2) (Fig. 3a). Based on BLAST analysis, the RTCV polyprotein is 28% identical to that of chicken Calicivirus (GenBank No. HQ010042). RT-PCR screening of all individual samples showed that only one sample was positive to RTCV (as expected, within the same pool in which we detected RTCV using our HTS approach).",

Based on ICTV species demarcation criteria of the Astroviridae family, a novel avastrovirus species should share between 33.8 and 78.3% amino acid distance in the complete ORF2 region4. Considering the RtAstV shared only 66% amino acid distance, we propose that the RtAstV should constitute a novel species member within the genus Avastrovirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences of ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 showed that RtAstV forms a monophyletic clade with Avian nephritis virus 1 (Genbank No. HM029238) identified in healthy chicken flocks in China34, and avian nephritis virus (Genbank No. NC_003790) associated with acute nephritis in chickens worldwide8.

To remove naked DNA and RNA, 200 \u03bcl of the resuspended pellet from each pool were digested in a cocktail with 20U of Turbo DNase (Life Technologies, USA), 25U of benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 0.1 mg/ml of RNase A (Life Technologies, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 hours in 20 \u03bcl of 10X DNase buffer (Life Technologies, USA). Subsequently, the viral genomes were extracted with a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, USA). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II cDNA synthesis kit and random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then, cDNAs were prepared for high-throughput sequencing using TruSeq Universal adapters (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and standard multiplex adaptors. A paired-end, 150-base-read protocol in RAPID module was used for sequencing in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing was performed in the Life Sciences Core Facility (LaCTAD) at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. Sequencing reads were de novo assembled using the MetaViC pipeline (available on https://github.com/sejmodha/MetaViC) as previously described50.",
