It also has been isolated in North America (Wesley et al., 1990; Jabrane et al., 1994). PRCV and TGEV have several striking differences. In contrast to TGEV, PRCV isolates have a deletion in the region that encodes mRNA 3 (Rasschaert et al., 1990; Vaughn et al., 1994). TGEV replicates in both the intestinal and respiratory tract without causing respiratory disorder. In contrast, PRCV replicates in lung tissue but little or not all in the intestinal tissues (O\u2019Toole et al., 1989; Cox et al., 1990).",

However, other investigations have linked PRCV with a field outbreak of respiratory disease and with respiratory disorders including pneumonia following experimental infection (O\u2019Toole et al., 1989; van Nieuwstadt and Pol, 1989; Vannier, 1990; Ahn et al., 1997). Differential serological diagnosis between PRCV and TGEV infection is not possible with the classical sero-neutralization test. Infection with PRCV or TGEV induces antibodies which neutralize both viruses to the same titer. However, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can differentiate between PRCV and TGEV infection (Callebaut et al., 1989; Simkins et al., 1993).",

The list of farms was obtained from the Korean Swine Association, and herds were included from all five of the country states. The sample size was based on financial and logistic restrictions. All farms in this study were farrow-to-finish operations and do not use an all-in-all-out system. No herds were vaccinated against any strain of PRCV. The average size of the 88 herds selected, 220 sows per herd, is considerably larger than the Korean average (currently approximately 135 sows per herd). A herd was considered positive when at least one of the sampled animals was positive. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.An ELISA kit (Svanova Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) with a sensitivity of 0.978% and specificity of 0.964% relative to the serum-neutralization test was used to determine the prevalence of PRCV infection (Dr. S. Carman, personal communication, University of Guelph). Blood was collected by jugular puncture and allowed to clot, centrifuged and the serum kept at \u221220\u00b0C until used. One hundred microliters of the 1:2 dilution of test sera added to duplicate wells coated with TGEV antigen, and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. The wells were then washed three times with a phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween (300 \u03bcl/well). The plates were reincubated for 30 min at room temperature and after being washed three times, were incubated for 30 min with 100 \u03bcl of anti-mouse IgG horse-radish peroxidase conjugate solution. After being washed three times, the plates were incubated for 30 min with 100 \u03bcl of substrate solution at room temperature. The reaction was then stopped by addition of 50 \u03bcl of a stop solution into each well. The optical density of each well was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a ELISA microplate reader.",

This confirms the nearly complete spread of PRCV across Korea. Airborne transmission may have facilitated the dissemination of the virus between nearby herds; the infection does not appear to require carrier animals (Martin et al., 1994). The targets of this survey were 24- to 26-week-old finishing pigs. Finishing pigs were chosen because most pregnant sows are vaccinated with TGEV in Korea. Moreover, maternal PRCV- and TGEV-antibodies become seronegative by the age of 18 weeks (Pensaert et al., 1986). The ELISA kit used in this study can discriminate between antibodies developed after a PRCV infection from antibodies developed after a TGEV infection.",
