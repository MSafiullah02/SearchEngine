With the promotion of NAHEF, health education methods have been continuously improved. The health education of migrant workers has been determined and organized by communities and villages. Based on local culture and customs, information on health education is widely disseminated through mass media. This method combines mass media and interpersonal communication to improve farmers\u2019 health awareness.",

The Chinese government has further standardized the service forms and requirements of rural health education activities. However, due to the characteristics of sizeable regional mobility and low educational level, the health education effect on migrant workers is not ideal [28,29]. At present, based on the effective use of the existing health education communication network, there is little research on the best method of health education.

To some extent, these two reasons showed that the patients overestimated their physical ability and ignored their conditions. It is undeniable that experience-based coping can probably obtain the right medicine, and some diseases can also achieve self-healing by the autoimmune system. However, the causes of illness may be various. The wrong judgment may lead to severe consequences such as the aggravation of conditions, which need to be avoided. In addition, \u201cI am too busy to seek healthcare\u201d may also be due to the low labor contract signing rate of migrant workers. According to the survey of the Chinese government, only 35.1% of migrant workers signed labor contracts in 2016 [34], but in the same year, the labor contract signing rate of Chinese enterprises reached more than 90% [35]. Without the guarantee of labor contracts, migrant workers\u2019 work status is precarious and vulnerable. Some migrant workers even get paid by the day, which means that leaving work to seek healthcare will cause wage losses. Future policies need to improve the signing rate of migrant workers\u2019 labor contracts to ensure stability of employment. Besides, the proportion of migrant workers who think they can recover, have lack of money, or feel that they are being troublesome in seeking medical aid is relatively low. This result showed that the objective restrictions represented by lack of money and lack of medical service availability were not the main reasons to restrict most people\u2019s access to health services. This conclusion conflicted with Peng et al. (2010) [9], indicating that the work of the Chinese government in recent years to protect migrant workers\u2019 access to health services has been effective.",

However, the proportion of migrant workers who choose medical treatment was still low. Therefore, to promote the healthcare-seeking behavior of migrant workers, we should consider not only the supply side of public health services but also the demand side [36]. Society should guide migrant workers to form scientific medical habits. Overall planning of health service supply and demand is crucial to change the underutilization of health services of migrant workers in China. Our results showed that some migrant workers overestimated their abilities and neglected their conditions. To solve this problem, we should carry out effective health education, letting migrant workers understand the diversity of causes and the severity of the disease, to raise their attention and finally improve their medical behavior.",

This result showed that migrant workers were more inclined to face-to-face learning like lectures and public consultation when they received health education. The health education methods of publicity materials and bulletin boards tended to let migrant workers learn by themselves. This traditional way of education might be annoying, making it difficult to stimulate an interest of learning [37,38]. Online education also requires self-study but played a significant role in improving the healthcare-seeking behavior of migrant workers. The reason for this phenomenon may be that online education had sufficient information and more convenient access to information. With the increasing popularity of the Internet, online education with lower cost and more diverse forms will be an essential approach to health education in the future.",

Publicity material and bulletin board accounted for 83.8% and 72.7% of the migrant workers who had received health education, respectively. Lectures, public consultation, and online education, which had significant impacts on migrant workers, only accounted for about 40%. This condition partly explains the results that health education had significant but insufficient effects on healthcare-seeking behavior. The possible reason was that for government clerks, traditional education approaches, such as publicity materials and bulletin boards, were the most commonly used methods and the least costly. Lectures and public consultation had higher requirements for human, material, and financial investment, leading to their low availability. As a new method of health education, online education has no ready-made working standard. It needs grass-roots workers to explore and develop by themselves, and the corresponding learning cost is high. Rationally, when the educational effect is not included in the work assessment, these most commonly used method of health education is the best choice for the government clerks.",

The mediating effect of health knowledge between health education and healthcare-seeking behavior may be tested in future research. Second, when measuring healthcare-seeking behavior, we only chose to seek healthcare after illness. However, other indicators of healthcare-seeking behavior, such as where to seek healthcare, were not included in the analysis. Future research can select more variables to measure the concept of healthcare-seeking behavior according to different aspects of patients\u2019 medical treatment. Third, we only chose the method of receiving health education as the independent variables, without distinguishing possible differences in the quality of education.

To some extent, the objective limitation (e.g., lack of money or medical service availability) of healthcare-seeking behavior faced by migrant workers has been alleviated. However, due to subjective reasons (e.g., the overestimation of physical ability and neglect of disease) caused by lack of education knowledge, the proportion of migrant workers who chose to go to seek healthcare after disease was still low. Health education could significantly improve the healthcare-seeking behavior of migrant workers, but there is still ample space for improvement. Not all health education methods were significantly correlated to healthcare-seeking behavior. Lectures, public consultation, and online education were positively related to healthcare-seeking behavior, while publicity material and bulletin boards were not. More significantly, although the effects of publicity materials and bulletins were limited, these two health education methods are still the two most widely used methods. Therefore, investment in lectures, public consultation, and online education remains to be strengthened. Increasing investment in these three methods, especially improving the standardized implementation mode of online education, is of significance to promote the development of health education. This study provides evidence for understanding the health education of migrant workers and promotes the development of health education. At the same time, with the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, people in some countries still do not pay enough attention to health, bringing challenges. We hope that this paper can give some inspiration to governments in other countries to improve people\u2019s attention to health through effective health education.",
