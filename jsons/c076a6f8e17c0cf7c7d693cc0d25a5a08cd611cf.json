By using comprehensive and sensitive microbiologic testing, bacteria and/or viruses can be detected in the middle ear fluid (MEF) in up to 96 % of AOM cases (e.g., 66 % bacteria and viruses together, 27 % bacteria alone, and 4 % virus alone) [5] .

In a prospective, longitudinal study of children younger than 4 years in the USA, 63 % of 864 URI episodes were positive for respiratory viruses; rhinovirus and adenovirus were most frequently detected [4] . Of URI caused by a single virus, the rate of AOM complicating URI was highest in the episodes caused by adenovirus, coronavirus, and RSV. Molecular technologies have made it possible to detect new respiratory viruses related with AOM. Human metapneumoviruses (hMPV) were discovered a decade ago, and are now recognized as an important pathogen causing lower respiratory tract infection and URTIs in children. In a cohort of 1338 children with respiratory symptoms, hMPV was detected in 3.5 % of the children, and 41 % of infections were complicated by AOM [12] . The incidence of hMPV was highest in children younger than 2 years (7.6 %); 61 % of children younger than 3 years of age had hMPV infections complicated by AOM.",

The proportion of AOM cases with pathogenic bacteria isolated from the MEF varies depending on bacteriologic techniques, transport issues, and stringency of AOM definition. In series of reports from the USA and Europe from 1952-1981 and 1985-1992, the mean percentage of cases with bacterial pathogens isolated from the MEFs was 69 and 72 %, respectively [26] . A large series from the University of Pittsburgh Otitis Media Study Group reported bacterial pathogens in 84 % of the MEFs from 2807 cases of AOM [26] . Studies that applied more stringent otoscopic criteria and/or use of bedside specimen plating on solid agar in addition to liquid transport media have a reported rate of recovery of pathogenic bacteria from middle ear exudates ranging from 85 to 90 % [27] [28] [29] . When using appropriate stringent diagnostic criteria, careful specimen handling, and sensitive microbiologic techniques, the vast majority of cases of AOM involve pathogenic bacteria either alone or in concert with viral pathogens.",

The most commonly identified pathogen is S. pneumonia, which, prior to adoption of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), was isolated in approximately one third to half of all cases [30] . Block et al. studied changes of microbiology after the community-wide vaccination with PCV7 [31] . Comparing each cohort (1992-1998 vs. 2000-2003) , the proportion of S. pneumoniae significantly decreased from 48 to 31 %, and nontypable H. influenzae significantly increased from 41 to 56 %. Post-PCV7, Gram-negative bacteria and beta-lactamase-producing organisms accounted for two thirds and one half of all AOM isolates, respectively. In terms of serotypic change in S. pneumoniae, vaccine efficacy of PCV7 against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal OM was about 60 %. A later report [32] with data from 2007 to 2009, 6-8 years after the introduction of PCV7 in the USA, showed that PCV7 strains of S. pneumoniae virtually disappeared from the MEF of children with AOM who had been vaccinated. However, the frequency of isolation of non-PCV7 serotypes of S. pneumoniae from the MEF overall increased; this has made isolation of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae of children with AOM nearly equal. In summary, the licensed 7-valent CRM197-PCV7 has modest beneficial effects in healthy infants with a low baseline risk of AOM. Administering PCV7 in high-risk infants, after early infancy and in older children with a history of AOM, appears to have no benefit in preventing further episodes.",

S. pyogenes has been shown to occur more commonly in older children [46] and cause a greater degree of inflammation of the middle ear and tympanic membrane (TM), a greater frequency of spontaneous rupture of the TM, and more frequent progression to acute mastoiditis compared with other bacterial pathogens [46] [47] [48] . As for clinical findings in cases with S. pneumoniae and nontypeable H. influenzae, some studies suggest that signs and symptoms of AOM caused by S. pneumoniae may be more severe (fever, severe earache, bulging TM) than those caused by other pathogens [29, 49, 50] . These findings were refuted by results of the studies that found AOM caused by nontypeable H. influenzae to be associated with bilateral AOM and more severe inflammation of the TM [51, 52] . Leibovitz et al. [53] concluded, in a study of 372 children with AOM caused by H. influenzae ( N = 138), S. pneumoniae ( N = 64), and mixed H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae ( N = 64), that clinical/otologic scores could not discriminate among various bacterial etiologies of AOM. However, there were significantly different clinical/otologic scores between bacterial culture-negative and culture-positive cases. A study of middle ear exudates of 82 cases of bullous myringitis has shown a 97 % bacteria-positive rate, primarily S. pneumoniae. In contrast to the previous belief, Mycoplasma sp. is rarely the causative agent in this condition [54] . Accurate prediction of the bacterial cause of AOM on the basis of clinical presentation, without bacterial culture of the middle ear exudates, is not possible, but specific etiologies may be predicted in some situations. Published evidence has suggested that AOM associated with conjunctivitis (otitis-conjunctivitis syndrome) is more likely caused by nontypeable H. influenzae than by other bacteria [55] [56] [57] .",

Antibiotic resistance remains a challenge to successful therapy with ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci present in the community and increasing emergence of blactamase-negative, amoxicillin-resistant NTHi identified globally. The next-generation PC-13V has been introduced, and early data suggest efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and carriage of SP19A, the multidrug resistance isolate that has been associated with both treatment failure in AOM 90 and the increasing number of cases of pneumococcal mastoiditis. Promising data on an 11-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine with protein D as a carrier was published in 2006, but additional confirmation of efficacy against NTHi otitis media with the licensed formulation, PHiD-CV (a 10-valent conjugate), is pending data future studies. For NTHI specifically, a number of candidate protein antigens have had progress to human trials since 2007, remains to be demonstrated. Multiple candidates have demonstrated the necessary requirements for candidate vaccine antigens: conservation among isolates, surface exposure, immunogenicity in animals, and protection in animal models of disease or specifically experimental otitis media. Further research of the role of each antigen in the pathogenesis of disease, to elicit response in the youngest infants is likely to be productive and permit more antigens to move into clinical trials.",

Widespread use of PCV13 could potentially reduce diseases caused by multidrug-resistant pneumococcal serotypes and diminish the need for the use of higher dose of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate for AOM. Some H. influenzae isolates produce \u03b2-lactamase enzyme, causing the isolate to become resistant to penicillins. Current data from different studies with non-AOM sources and geographic locations that may not be comparable show that 58-82 % of H. influenzae isolates are susceptible to regular and high-dose amoxicillin [42, 70, 71, 81] . These data represented a significant decrease in \u03b2-lactamaseproducing H. influenzae, compared with data reported in the 2004 AOM guideline.",

It is important to note that alternative antibiotics vary in their efficacy against AOM pathogens.

In vitro efficacy of cefdinir and cefuroxime against H. influenzae is approximately 98 %, compared with 58 % efficacy of amoxicillin and nearly 100 % efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate [81] .

The previously cited rate of cross-sensitivity to cephalosporins among penicillin-allergic patients (approximately 10 %) is likely an overestimate. The rate was based on data collected and reviewed during the 1960s and 1970s. A study analyzing pooled data of 23 studies, including 2400 patients with reported history of penicillin allergy and 39,000 with no penicillin-allergic history concluded that many patients who present with a history of penicillin allergy do not have an immunologic reaction to penicillin [88] . The chemical structure of the cephalosporin determines the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents [87, 90] . The degree of crossreactivity is higher between penicillins and firstgeneration cephalosporins but is negligible with the second-and third-generation cephalosporins. Because of the differences in the chemical structures, cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone are highly unlikely to be associated with cross-reactivity with penicillin [87] . Despite this, the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology [91] stated that \"cephalosporin treatment of patients with a history of penicillin allergy, selecting out those with severe reaction histories, show a reaction rate of 0.1 %.\" They recommend cephalosporin in cases without severe and/or recent penicillin-allergy reaction history when skin test is not available.",

Almost all middle ear pathogens derive from the pathogens colonizing the nasopharynx, but not all nasopharyngeal pathogens enter the middle ear to cause AOM. The positive predictive value of nasopharyngeal culture during AOM (likelihood that bacteria cultured from the nasopharynx is the middle ear pathogen) ranges from 22 to 44 % for S. pneumoniae, 50-71 % for nontypeable H. influenzae, and 17-19 % for M catarrhalis. The negative predictive value (likelihood that bacteria not found in the nasopharynx are not AOM pathogens) ranges from 95 to 99 % for all three bacteria [107, 108] . Therefore, if nasopharyngeal culture is negative for specific bacteria, that organism is likely not the AOM pathogen. A negative culture for S. pneumoniae, for example, will help eliminate the concern for multidrug-resistant bacteria and the need for unconventional therapies, such as levofloxacin or linezolid. On the other hand, if S. pneumoniae is cultured from the nasopharynx, the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern can help guide treatment.",
