In this study, results of high-throughput virome sequencing, bacterial culture, targeted real-time PCR and histological examination of 130 bovine pneumonic lungs from western Canadian cattle were combined to explore associations of microorganisms with different types of pneumonia. Fibrinous bronchopneumonia (FBP) was the predominant type of pneumonia (46.2%, 60/130) and was associated with the detection of Mannheimia haemolytica. Detection of Histophilus somni and Pasteurella multocida was associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia (SBP) and concurrent bronchopneumonia and bronchointerstitial pneumonia (BP&BIP), respectively. Sixteen viruses were identified, of which bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) was the most prevalent (11.5%, 15/130) followed by ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (UTPV1, 8.5%, 11/130) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV, 8.5%, 11/130).",

Killed and modified live virus vaccines for BRSV, BVDV, BHV1 and BPIV3 are available for BRD prevention in North America (Fulton et al., 2016) . Unfortunately, assessment of the effectiveness of bacterial vaccination for BRD has indicated variable to little benefit (Griffin et al., 2010; Larson & Step, 2012) , and excessive anti-microbial usage for metaphylaxis raises concerns of increasing antibiotic resistance for both animals and humans (Portis, Lindeman, Johansen, & Stoltman, 2012) .

Bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012 ) was used to map the trimmed reads to the host (Bos taurus) reference genome (PRJNA33843, PRJNA32899), and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009 ) was implemented to identify the unmapped reads, which were subsequently extracted from the original fastq files using cdbyank. The extracted unmapped reads were assembled into contigs with default parameters using Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011) . The assembled reads were compared with the virus Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database (Brister, Ako-Adjei, Bao, & Blinkova, 2015) using BLASTn. Virus-like contigs aligning over a minimum length of 100 base pairs with expect value < 10 -3 to the RefSeq database were further examined manually by BLASTx comparison to the NCBI non-redundant protein database to identify any spurious matches. The total number of reads corresponding to each identified virus was determined from the Bowtie2 SAM results files.",

The heatmap below the dendrogram shows pathogen profiles of individual samples including positive (red) or negative (blue) for each microorganism.

Furthermore, another study of characterization of virome of BRD in nasal swabs from feedlot cattle suggested IDV as an aetiology (Mitra et al., 2016) . In order to investigate whether these viruses play direct roles in pulmonary lesions, the metagenomic virome of pneumonic lungs was characterized.",

Our results demonstrate that there are strong associations between different types of histopathologic lesions and the presence of particular BRD-associated bacteria. While the relatively low prevalence of viruses in pneumonic lungs limits the diagnostic utility of virus detection in this specimen, our results do confirm the effectiveness of the metagenomic sequencing technique itself and illustrate how its non-targeted nature allows accurate and simultaneous detection of multiple viruses, which presents a distinct advantage over application of multiple targeted assays. Future development of robust methods for simultaneous detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi with metagenomic sequencing will further enable the application of this approach to both pathogenesis research and diagnostic investigations of complex clinical syndromes like BRD.

They are frequently isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy cattle, but can cause disease under some circumstances when host defences have been compromised by stress or viral infection(Caswell, 2014). Experimental models of bacterial pneumonia have been successfully established by infection with BHV1 or BVDV followed by M. haemolytica(Burciaga-Robles et al., 2010;Jericho & Langford, 1978). We observed significant associations of bacteria with particular types of pneumonia. M. haemolytica was associated with FBP, consistent with well-established knowledge(Caswell, 2016a). We also found that H. somni was associated with SBP (but not FBP), and P. multocida was associated with BP&BIP. The strong associations of H. somni and M. haemolytica with SBP and FBP, respectively, indicate that histopathology can be useful in differentiating different bacterial aetiologies. A recent study showed that aerosolized challenge of M. haemolytica consistently resulted in development of FBP, which may indicate that M. haemolytica can also be a primary pathogen(Bassel et al., 2019) although the study design did not rule out the infection of unconventional viruses such as IDV or BRBV as a contributing factor. Interestingly, in most cases where M. haemolytica was detected, no viruses or rare bacteria were detected",
