It has been identified that the etiological agent of SARS is a novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV [1] . The spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the major envelope component, constituting the spike projecting from the virion surface, which mediates many of the biological properties of the virus, such as attachment to cell receptors, penetration, and spread by virus-induced cell to cell fusion. The S protein also plays an important role in the immune responses against the virus since neutralizing antibody, passive antibody protection, and cellular immunity have been related to the protein. Therefore, the spike protein may act as the most potential antigen for SARS vaccine design [2] . The S gene of SARS-CoV encodes a surface glycoprotein precursor predicted to be 1255 amino acids in length. It belongs to type I membrane protein and has low level of similarity (20%-27% amino acid identity) with other coronaviruses [3] .

Mutations in S gene have previously been correlated with altered pathogenesis, virulence and tropism in other coronaviruses [7] . The S proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved by a host cell trypsin-like protease into S1 involved in receptor binding and S2 involved in cell fusion. The S proteins are the major targets of the neutralizing antibodies in some animal coronaviruses and can also induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes. For example, the S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) could elicit neutralizing antibodies which protect animals from virulent virus challenge. In addition, the immune protection of S1 subunit at N-terminus of S protein is more potent than that of S2 subunit at C-terminus [8, 9] . However, it is not the case in feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV), in which the antibodies against the S protein of FIPV are not protective. It has been found that the antibodies against FIPV S protein enhance the disease progression, this is the same as the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection effects of Dengue Virus, in which virus-antibody immune complexes bind to monocytes or macroph-ages via Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G or complement receptors on the cell surface [10] .

The reactivity of SARS-CoV virion lysate is more sensitive than that of recombinant S301 protein in the detection of specific antibodies, probably because S301 protein is non-glycosylated nature and covers only partial epitopes of the complete S protein. In addition, the quantity and structure of the coated antigen may also influence the sensitivity of ELISA. The detective specificity of the recombinant S301 protein was the same as virion lysate, indicating that the antibodies induced by the DNA vaccine are specific for S protein.
