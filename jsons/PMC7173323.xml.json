It is noteworthy that we found a prevalence of hRV of 33.3% if both nasal and breath sample results at each time point were considered, suggesting nasal sampling alone might underestimate community prevalence. It is also recognized that other microorganisms,33 including coronaviruses and bocavirus34, 35 and some transient bacterial infections,36 for which we did not test, might also play a role in wheezing.

This finding of relatively weak but highly significant associations between virus nasal positivity and day-to-day asthma symptoms contrasts with previous reports of strong associations between the presence of respiratory viruses and the occurrence of acute exacerbations of asthma. For example, in an emergency department study, odds ratios of 31.5 (95% CI, 8.3-108; P < .001) have been reported for the risk of acute wheezing in highly mite atopic children with an hRV infection compared with those seen in virus-negative children37 and 19.4 (95% CI, 3.7-101.5; P = .001) for the combination of atopy, allergen exposure, and viral infection for hospital admission compared with those in patients with stable asthma. In this latter study the odds ratio for rhinovirus alone was 7.0 (95% CI, 2.5-19.9; P < .001).23 The contrasting findings during day-to-day sampling in the present study are consistent with increasing awareness that in asthmatic patients symptom control can be dissociated from the risk of exacerbations,38 and a recent task force report found that it is not possible to distinguish between transient loss of symptom control and a mild exacerbation.39\n",

These aerosols of viral RNA have previously been detected by us and others using a variety of methods.11, 41, 42, 43 It is unknown whether differences in the detection of viral RNA in exhaled samples compared with nasal samples was due to the virus being present less frequently in the exhaled samples or because of the smaller volume of airway fluid in these samples.

This approach allows more precise estimates of the associations between the effect of virus detection in a subject at a single point in time and the occurrence of symptoms (eg, cough or wheeze) at that time or at various times afterward. A further refinement of our models was the inclusion of lag terms to account for delay effects of exposures on outcomes and the testing of effect modification by factors that might affect these associations.

Much of our understanding of this subject is derived from studies of acute exposure episodes,49 patients' perceptions about triggers,50 and studies of uncommon events within large community studies.51 Recent reviews52, 53, 54 cite multiple types of inhaled exposures, medication adherence, and emotional, dietary, and hormonal factors as risk factors for exacerbations, but population attributable risks for day-to-day asthma and respiratory symptoms have not been reported.

With the possible exception of a history of low ICS use increasing cough after a viral infection, the other interactions shown in Table V were not repeated across the lagged times and are inconsistent with other studies. For example, the lowest quartile of mite exposure was associated with increased cough, whereas other data suggest mite exposure is positively associated with cough.55, 56 Similarly, our finding that a vitamin D level of greater than the cut point of 50 nmol/L was associated with increased wheeze is inconsistent with most data that higher vitamin D levels are associated with better respiratory outcomes.24 Whether the enhanced immune response to viral infection associated with higher vitamin D levels is also associated with increased wheeze requires further study. The most surprising finding was the lack of interaction with atopy. This is in contrast to several cohort studies that show a synergy between asthma exacerbations and viruses, either alone22, 37, 57 or in combination with allergen exposure.23, 58 However, in the longitudinal cohort study most comparable in structure to ours,6 the effect of sensitization on symptoms was most evident with severe symptoms, and this would not be identified by using our analysis.",
