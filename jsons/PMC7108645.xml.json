Design Just-In-Time Training, adaptability, and cross-training, including basic ventilator use, medication pumps, pressure bag implementation, and equipment troubleshooting for non-intensive care unit staff. Nonspecialty physician, nurse practitioner, and physician assistants training in life-saving procedures (eg endotracheal intubation, cricothyroidotomy, needle decompression, etc.).Increase training center capabilities for both ongoing as well as upscaling for Just-in-Time training, including establishing regional training centers need to be developed to train key staff at health systems who will conduct the ongoing and Just-in-Time Training.\n",

Clinicians often rely upon these official guidance announcements, especially during emergencies. A unified message is key to promoting a standardized approach to clinical practices across multiple health-care systems. This guidance includes elements such as accurate case definitions (eg, incubation period, symptomology, and exposure), managing ill staff, and vaccine protocols and standards).Coordination: Develop and implement qualitative and quantitative triggers to access public health and emergency management resources at the local, state, and national levels to support health-care delivery systems.Collaboration: Ongoing collaboration with the health community, effective information sharing, and coordination of response activities in preparing for and responding to a pandemic.
