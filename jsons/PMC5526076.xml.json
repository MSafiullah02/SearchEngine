These complex glycans are attached N-linked or O-linked to proteins as a part of post-translational modifications or attached to lipids. The complexity and structural heterogeneity of the glycans displayed on host cell/tissue surface and on viral surface glycoproteins predominantly arises from the complex non-template driven biosynthetic machinery of the host cell involving several enzymes that show tissue-specific expression patterns [5, 6, 7]. The interplay between the virus and the host involves interactions between two surfaces decorated by complex glycans. In addition to the glycans, a critical component involved in this interplay is a set of proteins known as glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) or lectins (Figure 1\n).",

The binding affinity and specificity are further enhanced through avidity and multivalency wherein multiple glycan motifs displayed on the surface bind to multiple glycan binding sites in the GBP oligomer unit [1\u2022\u2022, 9].",

For example, complex glycans terminated by \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6-linked sialic acid (N-acetyl neuraminic acid) act as receptors for several different viruses [10\u2022]. Linear sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate act as co-receptors for a variety of viruses [11] including dengue virus [12, 13], hepatitis C virus [14], and foot-and-mouth disease virus [15]. The predominant display of specific glycan motifs on surfaces of different cells and tissues contributes to the host restriction and cell/tissue tropism of the virus. As an example, the human upper respiratory epithelial surface predominantly display sialylated glycan receptors terminated by \u03b12-6-linked sialic acid and these receptors are specifically recognized by hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) on surface of influenza A viruses that are known to infect and transmit via respiratory droplets in humans [4, 16, 17, 18]. On the other hand, when influenza A viruses that are commensal or epizootic in birds infect humans, they typically affect deep lung and other tissues that predominantly display sialylated glycan receptors terminated by \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid and are unable to transmit efficiently via respiratory droplets.",

In most cases, glycosylation sites on viral surface proteins are highly conserved since the glycans at these sites critically maintain the stability of these proteins and the viral particles as a whole.

While GBPs anchored on surfaces of host cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) play a role in viral entry, it also plays a dual role to enhance antigen presentation and processing for adaptive immune response [1\u2022\u2022]. Sites of N-linked glycosylation are often positively selected during evolution of the virus in human host to increase glycans on the viral surface so as to present glycans that mimic self-antigens and mask the underlying protein epitope which in turn permits the virus to evade host immune response. In other cases, particularly with HIV, the clustering of glycosylation sites on the gp120 surface glycoprotein present novel glyco-eptiopes that do not mimic self-antigens and therefore lead to potent neutralization by antibodies that target these novel eptiopes across a broad spectrum of viral strains [20\u2022\u2022]. This review covers some general concepts on role of host cell surface glycan receptors and viral surface glycans in viral pathogenesis. Some perspectives on developing the appropriate tools to define target glycan motifs on host cells or viral surface towards developing antiviral strategies is also presented.",

The binding specificity of the viral surface hemagglutinin (HA) to sialylated glycan receptors on the host cell surface is one of many factors that critically govern adaptation of influenza to the human host. Avian virus HA binds with high specificity and affinity to glycans terminated by \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid which are found in abundance in avian gut and lower respiratory tract of humans [40, 41, 42]. Human virus HAs possess characteristic glycan receptor binding properties; their HA predominantly binds with high affinity (or avidity) to glycan receptors terminated by \u03b12-6-linked sialic acid, which are predominantly expressed in the upper respiratory epithelia of humans [40, 43, 44]. The human upper respiratory epithelium is the primary target site for infection of human-adapted viruses and is thought to be a prerequisite for efficient human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets [4]. In addition to HA, influenza A virus surface also has an enzyme that cleaves sialic acid from both viral surface and host cell surface glycans to enhance productivity of infection, prevent self-aggregation of new virions that emerge from productive infection in a host cell [45, 46]. In fact one of the earliest antiviral therapeutic strategies based on host cell surface glycan receptors was the design of sialic acid analogues (oseltamivir, zanamivir, etc.) to specifically bind to and inactivate the influenza A virus NA [47].",

Molecular dynamics simulation studies predicted that HA glycans may form interactions near the binding pocket to influence receptor binding [56]. Site-directed mutagenesis to knock-out glycosylation sites on HA or modifying structure of N-linked glycans on the virus by enzymatic treatment or transgenic cell lines have shown distinct changes in glycan-receptor binding specificity [57]. In the case of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses, a mutation that abrogates glycosylation at a single highly conserved site significantly impacted the ability of the virus to bind to \u03b12-6 sialylated glycan receptors but not to \u03b12-3 sialylated glycan receptors [58]. Site-specific loss-of-glycosylation mutations have also been shown to impact glycan receptor-binding specificity which in-turn governed virulence in mice [59, 60, 61]. Therefore, it is evident that the viral surface glycosylation governed by specific glycosylation sites and the structural heterogeneity of the glycans at each site in the relevant physiological context of virus interaction with the host cell has multidimensional roles in pathogenesis of the virus in the host.",

A highly complex description of glycan target would involve defining the glycan motif, the linkage of the glycan comprising this motif to specific glycosylation site on a specific protein and a geometrical arrangement of such glycosylation sites on the glycoprotein. An example of such a complex definition is the glyco-epitope surfaces on HIV gp120 targeted by potent broad spectrum neutralizing antibodies.

Furthermore, the advances in chemical synthesis of glycans coupled with the ability to probe finer nuances of glycan motif recognition by various lectins using glycan array platforms has substantially improved the knowledge on the diversity of glycan motifs recognized by various GBPs [65\u2022, 66]. These GBPs can be directly used to stain host cell or tissue surfaces and multiplexing the staining of more than one GBP can expand the knowledge of the glycan motifs distributed on these surfaces [4, 67, 68]. As an example co-staining of host tissues or cells with Sambucus nigra agglutinin I (SNA-I) which binds with high specificity to \u03b12-6 sialylated glycans and Concanavalin A (ConA) which binds to trimannosyl core of N-linked glycans would give information on predominance of \u03b12-6 sialylated glycans that are N-linked to the glycoproteins. These lectins can also be displayed in an array-like platform and samples such as whole viruses or virus-like particles comprising of the viral surface glycoprotein can be probed for their binding to such lectin-arrays [65\u2022, 69, 70, 71]. This would again provide information on the prevalence of specific glycan motifs that are present as a part of the glycans on the viral surface glycoproteins. The advantages of using lectins is that it provides a read on the glycan motif in their physiological context either on the host tissue or cell or viral surface and do not require any additional processing that may change the structural diversity of the glycans before analysis. However, a limitation in this approach arises from the lack of a comprehensive panel of lectins that can completely decode the structural diversity of the glycans. As an example while lectins like SNA-I give an accurate picture of distribution of glycans capped by \u03b12-6-linked sialic acid, the information on whether this motif is a part of highly branched N-linked glycans or a part of long oligosaccharide branch length cannot be deduced.",

In most cases the scope of the analysis is to obtain a primary screen of a whole virus or viral surface glycoprotein or mammalian GBP against the maximum diversity of glycan motifs that can be generated in a defined fashion synthetically. Following this primary screen, the second objective is to usually probe deeper into the quantitative differences in affinity and avidity between different viruses for specific glycan motifs. This would often involve doing a dose-dependent binding of the viral surface glycoprotein (or whole virus) to defined motifs in secondary assays such as surface plasmon resonance or isothermal titration calorimetry [77, 82]. It is important to understand the glycan target motif while designing the glycan arrays for probing nuances of glycan binding specificities. For example, if one were trying to understand the nuances in binding of antibodies that target glycan shield of HIV surface protein gp120-gp41, then using an array of just different high mannose and complex glycans may not fully capture the nuances in the antibody-binding given that the underlying peptide epitope would not be present in such a platform. This might lead to confounding interpretations on link between target glycan motif recognized by these antibodies and their neutralization potential in in vitro and in vivo assays. It is therefore be more appropriate to use the recently developed BG505 SOSIP.644 gp120-gp41 trimeric unit [83] expressed in different cell types (and also mutant forms that lack specific glycosylation sites) by presenting this trimeric unit and its variants on an platform to probe the nuances of glycan recognition by the glycan shield targeting antibodies.",

Over the past several years, there has been a substantial progress in developing tools for accurate molecular simulation of glycan\u2013protein interactions including improvement in force-fields to include glycan-specific parameters [84]. This progress has led to improvements in modeling the electron density of glycans to assign their coordinates in the co-crystal structures and also rectify errors in past assignments pertaining to incomplete ring closures, inaccurate ring and exocyclic torsion angles, etc. [85, 86\u2022, 87]. The growing wealth of GBP-glycan co-crystal structures and development of molecular simulation tools have permitted successful predictions of amino acid changes that would alter glycan-binding specificity of the GBP. A couple of areas where this approach has been extensively applied is in prediction and validation of mutations in influenza A virus HA that would switch its binding specificity from \u03b12-3 to \u03b12-6 sialylated glycan receptors [4, 88, 89, 90] and in engineering antibodies that target known glycan epitopes to alter their epitope specificity [91, 92, 93].",

This network approach has permitted obtaining insights into the molecular determinants of glycan receptor-binding specificity of influenza A virus HA going beyond just the residues that contact the glycans. This include role of site-specific glycosylation that impacts receptor-binding specificity [58, 59]. This network approach had also provided a framework to investigate amino acid changes required to switch glycan receptor-specificity (from \u03b12-3 to \u03b12-6 sialylated glycan receptors) of the H5N1 influenza HA in the context of additional changes in the glycan-binding site resulting from natural sequence evolution [88].

Despite this affinity, there is specificity in the glycan-binding site \u2014 glycan contacts which is also governed by the dynamics of glycan motion in the binding site compared to the unbound state. As a result, mutations in the amino acid that directly contacts the glycan or in other amino acids in its network of inter-residue contacts are likely to significantly impact the glycan-binding properties of the GBP. Thus it is important to capture the network properties on the protein and dynamics of glycan motion while modeling the molecular interactions between glycans and GBPs so as to engineer these interactions in a predictable fashion.",
