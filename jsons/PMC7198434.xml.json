In addition, the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will play a key role in determining appropriate lockdown exit strategies and in vaccine development [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]].

These ELISA assays provide a semiquantitative in vitro determination of human antibodies of the immunoglobulin classes IgG and IgA against the SARS-CoV-2. The microplate wells are coated with recombinant S1 structural protein. The results are evaluated semi-quantitatively by calculation of a ratio of the extinction of samples over the extinction of the calibrator. The ratio interpretation was as follows: <0.8 = negative, \u2265 0.8 to < 1.1 = borderline, \u2265 1.1 = positive. Borderline data were considered positive for the statistical analyses.",

In some cases, IgM line presented slight difficulty for reading in all commercial lateral flow tests. As predicted by the manufacturer, the results were obtained after ten minutes or less in all cases. All the tests performed in this study provided valid results. Overall sensitivity was similar (around 70%) without any significant differences between the three tests (Table 1). However, the sensitivity for IgM was significant lower (p < 0.001) with LabOn Time as compared to the QuickZen and Avioq assays. The Avioq lateral flow test showed three false positive results of concomitant IgM and IgG reactivity in three samples from a previous epidemic period without any known confounding factor. In contrast, no false positive results were observed among the pool of 31 sera containing antibodies with potential cross reactivity. Globally, no significant differences were observed between the specificity values of the three tests with a positive predictive value of 100% for QuickZen and LabOn Time and 97.7% for the Avioq assays. As shown in Table 2, similarly to the serological quantitative assays (ELISA and CLIA ), the sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays increased during the second week after the onset of symptoms and achieved similar values (91% to 94%) after 14 days.",

In this study, the ELISA IgG/IgA was tested on a fully automated microtiter plate analyser. The workflow for ELISA tests depends on the analyser used: in our laboratory, the capacity was 90 tests per 3-4 hours. In contrast, the CLIA IgG/IgM assays are fully automated random-access tests. This technology allows up to 180 tests per hour, depending on the platform used, with the results delivered in about 40 minutes. The performance of Maglumi IgG/IgM tests has been successfully evaluated by Padoan et al., showing the reliability of these immunoassays for assessing the immunological response in the sera of COVID-19 patients. These tests show that it takes at least 12 days to reach 100% sensitivity for IgG and a 88% positive rate for IgM [12]. In another study that compared the Maglumi IgG/IgM and Euroimmun IgG/IgA, 100% sensitivity was observed with Maglumi IgG 10 days following onset of symptoms. These authors reported a lower sensitivity for the Maglumi IgM (60%) compared to the Euroimmun IgA (100%) [13]. In the current study, the Maglumi IgG/IgM tests also showed overall lower sensitivity than the Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (64.3% vs 84.4%), but in contrast, their specificity increased to 100%. The mean days since symptom onset in the population tested for this study was 11.46 days (median of 10 days). This can explain the lower sensitivity of the Maglumi IgG/IgM tests in our study as compared to those in the literature. Obka et al. [8] also described higher sensitivity observed in the Euroimmun IgA test than in the Euroimmun IgG test (83.6% vs 61.7%). This was particularly evident in the two first weeks after symptom onset, but with less specificity for the former test (86.1% vs 98.6%).",

The results showed that their global sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were equivalent to the ELISA IgG/IgA or the CLIA IgG/IgM tests. In addition, excellent concordance between the five immunoassays tested in this study was observed 14 days after the onset of symptoms. Similar results were reported by Li et al., showing good sensitivity (88.6%) and specificity (90.6%) with a rapid test in a large cohort of patient samples in China. They observed similar performances with serum, plasma and fingerstick blood [14]. Rapid serological tests can be performed in the laboratory or used as point-of-care tests (POCT). The latter will provide accurate results within 10 to 15 minutes with equivalent sensitivity and specificity as the quantitative automated immunoassays, particularly two weeks after onset of symptoms. The opportunity to test outside of the clinical laboratory by lateral flow assay makes it possible to reach larger population groups without saturating the capacity of the laboratories. POCT may play an important role in large-scale testing in order to evaluate herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. However, mistakes in the interpretation of results in situations that are not under the control of trained staff must be taken into consideration. For this reason, the development of automated reader devices could help to reduce errors and increase sensitivity. In addition, such a device could support the transmission of the results to a public health institution to provide real-time information about seroprevalence at the population level.",

Zhao et al. revealed a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titres two weeks after illness onset [16]. Yongchen et al. highlight the complementary role of immunoassays to RT-qPCR in the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly in critical patients with a negative RT-qPCR. They observed seronegative asymptomatic patients four weeks after positive RT-qPCR results [17]. In the current study, two asymptomatic patients tested seronegative by all the immunoassays 20 days after a positive RT-qPCR result.
