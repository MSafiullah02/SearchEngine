Acepromazine was reported as effective for one case, however, the ability to accurately conclude an effect is doubted because it would not be possible to determine if this was because the cat was too sedated to express the behaviour or because the pain was controlled.

Finally, in a disease where the diagnosis is made by elimination, it is not possible to be certain that all the cats in the series definitely had FOPS.

FOPS was also described in a Burmese cross and a Burmilla, a breed where the ancestry can be traced back to Burmese and Chinchilla cats. This predisposition to a single purebred cat variety suggests a hereditary tendency and indeed many of the cats appeared closely related as is illustrated in Fig 4. Currently there is not enough information to determine the mode of inheritance. Any age of cat can be affected with FOPS and the age at first presentation ranged from 0.1 to 19 years. However, many affected cats first had signs when erupting permanent teeth and these cats often re-developed the syndrome as mature cats. It is possible that more of the cats were affected as kittens. Several Burmese breeders discussed the condition with the authors and were not only aware of the disease but reported that it was frequently necessary to bandage the paws of kittens whilst teething to prevent severe mutilation.

FOPS does not have the characteristics of a seizure disorder so it is perhaps more likely that the anti-epileptic drugs were effective because FOPS is a condition of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is a clinical syndrome of pain due to abnormal somatosensory processing in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (CNS).4 Unlike physiological and inflammatory pain it serves no beneficial purpose to the animal and can be regarded as a disease in itself. Discomfort ranges from spontaneous pain; paraesthesia (a spontaneous or evoked abnormal but not unpleasant sensation); dysaesthesia (a spontaneous or evoked unpleasant abnormal sensation usually described as burning); allodynia (pain from a stimulus that is not normally painful, eg, touch), or hyperpathia (increased pain from stimuli which are normally painful). Neuralgia is a pain in the distribution of a nerve or nerves and in FOPS the signs suggest discomfort is confined to the oral cavity and lips. The trigeminal nerve provides sensory information for these areas; however, there is no apparent discomfort elsewhere in the trigeminal nerve distribution, eg, nose or eyes. Trigeminal sensory loss is not apparent although the possibility of subtle deficits has not been ruled out especially given the extent of mutilation in some cases. In all cases the discomfort of FOPS was described as unilateral or worse on one side.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is complex and incompletely understood.4, 5 There are four pivotal phenomena intrinsic to its development; (1) peripheral activation, ie, sensitisation and/or excitation of peripheral sensory neurons,6 (2) central sensitisation, ie, the process of \u2018wind up\u2019 and the resulting transcriptional changes in spinal and medullary dorsal horn neurons leading to altered synaptic neurotransmitter levels and number of receptors,4, 7 (3) central disinhibition, ie, an imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory sides of the nervous system,4, 8 and (4) phenotypic change of mechanoreceptive A\u03b2-fibres (light touching) to produce substance P so that input from them is perceived as pain.9 The authors hypothesise that Burmese and possibly other cats prone to FOPS may have a dysfunction of central and/or ganglion processing of sensory trigeminal information. Signs of FOPS seem to be precipitated in many cases when the endings of the trigeminal nerves are damaged/sensitised, eg, with teething or dental disease. This study found that 63% of the cats had oral lesions, including dental disease, oral ulceration and eruption of permanent teeth. However, it should be considered that there is a high incidence of periodontal disease in the feline population; one study reported an incidence of 72%, with purebred cats being more predisposed,10 ie, a direct association cannot be proved at this time although anecdotally the signs of FOPS improved in many cases following resolution of the oral lesions.",

Human trigeminal neuralgia is characterised by severe pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, usually the mandibles and/or maxilla. People with this condition describe attacks of pain which typically last only seconds but may occur repeatedly within a short period of time.11 The attacks are often, but not always, precipitated by mild sensory stimulation of so called trigger zones (allodynia) which may be located anywhere within the territory of the affected trigeminal nerve. Classical antecedent stimuli include light touch, draughts of wind, and facial movement such as eating and drinking.11 This study found that 33 cats had signs of FOPS triggered by mouth movements including eating, drinking and/or grooming. Other anecdotal triggers were also reported. Human trigeminal neuralgia tends to occur in bouts over a period of weeks or months with subsequent spontaneous remission that may last months or years. Over time however, the attacks usually become more frequent and pain more sustained.11 In this study 46/113 cats were reported as having ongoing and persistent disease and in 38/46 cats there had been a history of previous recurrent bouts. The prognosis is poorer for this group (P\n = 0.047) and 13/46 were euthanased either because of FOPS or because of the effects of medication for FOPS.",

Unlike typical trigeminal neuralgia the cause of glossodynia is often enigmatic. For trigeminal neuralgia the majority of cases in humans can be shown to be due to demyelination of the trigeminal sensory fibres within the nerve root or brain stem. The most common cause is compression of the CNS nerve root by an overlying artery or vein.11 Familial trigeminal neuralgia is also described although it is rare.16, 17, 18, 19 By contrast glossodynia is considered to have a multifactorial aetiology and most cases are described as \u2018idiopathic\u2019. It is often linked to anxiety disorders \u2013 although this may be the effect rather that the cause.13, 20, 21, 22\n",

            "text": "Conditions of neuropathic pain can be greatly influenced by many internal and external factors.23 Examples of external factors include social variables, housing and other external stress factors. Genetic influences on homeostatic adaptation mechanisms to stress may also be important.23 The current study found that for 24 cats, an FOPS event could be directly linked to a situation causing anxiety. This equates to approximately one in five cats. This figure may be artificially low as anxiety or stress influences on disease are easily overlooked if appropriate questions are not asked during history taking. The most important queries are to ascertain if the five essential feline resources \u2013 food, water, resting places, latrines and points of entry and exit into the territory \u2013 are appropriately distributed. The cat should also have a private area(s) and the ability to hide and gain access to a high vantage point in order to control anxiety. The most common \u2018stress\u2019 contributing to FOPS was social, ie, other cats in the immediate environment suggesting that individuals with poor social coping strategies may be more vulnerable. Removing the cat from its core territory, eg, moving house or a stay in a cattery could also precipitate the disease. Psychosocial stress can promote a relative resistance to glucocorticoids with increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity together with increased production and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. This dysregulation of the stress/inflammatory pathways promotes alterations in brain circuitry that modulates mood, pain and the stress response. Over time, these functional changes probably promote disruptions in neurotrophic support and disturbances of glia\u2013neuronal communication. These changes, in turn, have been associated with the related processes of central sensitisation in pain disorders which may account for the progressive and self-perpetuating nature of the disease especially when inadequately treated.24\n",

Several anti-epileptic drugs have an anti-allodynic effect31 and are reported by human patients to be particularly effective for neuropathic pain that is burning and lancinating in nature.5 However, the anti-convulsants do not all have the same site of action and an area for further study is to ascertain which drugs are most efficacious and safe. Determining the nature of the suspected mutation in the Burmese cat and, therefore, the site of action for potential pharmacotherapy is an important future goal. In this study phenobarbital was chosen for treating many of the cats because its pharmacokinetics and toxicity have been studied in this species.32, 33 Diazepam was also used; however, the authors prefer to avoid this drug because of the risk of idiosyncratic hepatitic failure.34 Phenobarbital and diazepam exert their pharmacological effects via an action at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, in addition to other sites including the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (phenobarbital), calcium channels (phenobarbital and diazepam), sodium channels (diazepam) and voltage dependant potassium currents (phenobarbital).35 GABAergic neurons and ionotropic GABA(A) receptors are found in the dorsal horn36 and trigeminal ganglion37 where they control the propagation of pain signals from the periphery to higher CNS areas.36, 38 There is also evidence that GABAergic neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla are involved in a pain-control system that \u2018descends\u2019 from the brain onto the spinal cord.39 Recent evidence indicates that diminished GABA(A) medicated inhibitory control is a major factor in chronic pain syndromes.36 GABA receptor agonists display anti-nociceptive properties in a variety of animal models of pain38 although the side effects of such agents, in particular sedation, limit their usefulness.40\n",

Stress may also influence sodium channels, as a stressful environment may contribute to permanent sympathetic hyperactivity which will induce sodium channel up-regulation and sympathetic sprouting in dorsal root ganglia through nerve growth factor over-expression.47\n",

Burmese cats are predisposed and an inherited disorder affecting trigeminal sensory processing is suspected. A history of first signs during eruption of permanent teeth is common and the disease is often recurrent and with time may become unremitting. Oral lesions may be an important predisposing cause. Any oral disease should be identified and dental radiographs to detect more subtle lesions are recommended. Environmental factors may also influence the disease and the history should be explored for possible contributory factors. Identification of social incompatibility in a multi-cat household is a key step. For analgesia, if licensed products such as a combination of NSAIDs and opioids are ineffective, then (unlicensed) adjuvant drugs useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain may be beneficial. Based on the experiences in this paper phenobarbital (dose rate 2\u20133 mg/kg twice daily) is a reasonable first choice for treatment and can be given by the oral or intramuscular route. Further studies are necessary to establish which drugs are most effective for treating this disease and other anti-epileptic drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin may prove to be more appropriate. Periodic monitoring of liver function and drug serum concentrations is recommended for cats treated with anti-epileptic drugs.",

In this case the FOPS was thought to be triggered by a fractured upper canine with exposed pulp cavity. The damaged tooth was removed and the pain was managed with a reducing course of gabapentin.",
