The Orthomyxoviridae are a family of enveloped viruses with a genome consisting of 6~8 segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA, including four genera of influenza virus: A, B, C and D [3]. Influenza A and B are the main cause of annual flu outbreaks in humans, with influenza A further classified into subtypes based on their surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). 18 HA subtypes (H1~H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1~N11) are currently known, most notable today are the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes that co-circulate in the human population. Since the 1970s influenza B has diverged into two lineages based on antigenicity, the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, with little or no serum cross-reactivity [4]. In contrast to the severity and epidemic potential of influenza A and B, influenza C infections induce only mild flu symptoms in children, while influenza D is not known to infect humans [5].",

            "text": "Recurrent influenza epidemics with pre-existing immunity occurs because the influenza virus employs two mechanisms to escape recognition: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift is the gradual accumulation of point mutations on the influenza virus\u2019 surface glycoproteins HA and NA, driven by high error rates (estimated at 1.5 \u00d7 10\u2212 5 per nucleotide per replication [6]) of the virus\u2019 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Mutations that allow the virus to evade the host immune system are positively selected for and become fixed, resulting in the rise of new strains that are antigenically different from what the host was vaccinated against. The second escape mechanism, antigenic shift, is the reassortment of gene segments across different strains infecting the same host, resulting in a wholesale change in antigenicity [7, 8]. Antigenic shift have historically been associated with influenza pandemics, the most recent example being the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 that included segments from classical swine H1N1, Eurasian swine H1N1, and a triple reassortant from 1998 [9]. The rise of new strains through antigenic drift and shift is followed by cross-immunity mediated competition between antigenically similar strains, which results in a progressive replacement of existing strains with new variants [10, 11].",

This task is coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), which gathers year-round data from hundreds of national influenza centers around the world and issue vaccine formulation recommendations for each upcoming flu season [12]. When vaccine strains are well-matched with circulating strains, vaccination provides healthy adults younger than 65 years with 70\u201390% protection [13], and reduced hospitalizations in the elderly and those with chronic illnesses by 30\u201370% [14\u201316].

HA, apart from being the primary target for neutralizing antibodies, is the main facilitator of influenza virus entry by binding to sialic acids on the surface of the host cells. Human influenza HA preferentially bind to \u03b1-2,6 linked sialic acids commonly found on epithelial cells in the human upper respiratory tract [26, 27]. However, in egg-based production vaccine strains are inoculated into the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs which only contain \u03b1-2,3 linkages [28]. With successive passages, this becomes a selective pressure that can cause the acquisition or a total shift in receptor specificity, with its accompanying mutations and antigenic changes on HA\u2019s receptor binding site. A recent example of this occurred during the 2016\u20132017 flu season, when egg-adapted vaccine strains were found to lack a glycosylation site (T160, H3 numbering) on H3N2 HA antigenic site B, one of the five major antigenic sites that induce neutralizing antibodies [24].",

The reason for this lack of efficacy is still unclear, but possibilities include viral interference of tetravalent vaccine strains resulting in reduced virus shedding for the weakest strain, strong cross-reactive antibodies from previous seasons preventing virus replication, and inherent lower replication in host tissue by the H1N1 pandemic strain [33], among others. ACIP has since resumed recommendation for LAIV in 2018 following a change in the H1N1 vaccine component [34].",

But as the virus continued circulating in the human population up to the 1950s, it sequentially acquired glycans at positions 144, 172 and 177, all at or adjacent to the major antigenic site Sa on the HA head. This was followed by a 20-year hiatus as H1N1 was supplanted by H2N2, before re-emerging in 1977 carrying the same three acquired and one conserved glycosylation sites as before. The following decades saw N144 replaced by N142, the disappearance of N172, and the acquisition of N71 before the glycan shield was ultimately reset due to the emergence of 2009 pandemic H1N1, carrying only the original conserved glycosylation site on 104 [77]. Conversely, H3N2 circulated in 1968 carrying two glycans on its HA head, N81 and N165 (H3 numbering). Although the glycosylation site at position 81 was subsequently lost, positions 63, 122, 126, 133, 144, and 246 were accrued and retained [78]. Overall, the continued circulation of an influenza subtype in the human population corresponds to a steady increase in N-glycans on its HA head domain. Evidence that these acquired N-glycans provide a shielding effect comes from not only the observation that they tend to appear on or near major antigenic sites, but also studies have shown the acquisition of sites 177 and 142 on H1N1 slow genetic drift in the shielded areas [79], and mutational deletion of 177, 142 and 71 on a pre-pandemic H1N1 strain elicited a protective immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain [77]. Similarly, in H3N2 positive selection disappeared when an antigenic site becomes shielded by N-glycans [78], and the introduction of five recent glycosylation sites at positions 63, 122, 126, 133 and 246 allowed a 1968 H3N2 strain to evade polyclonal human serum raised against it [80].",

To accomplish this, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I deficient (GnTI\u2212) human embryonic kidney cells that are unable to synthesize complex type N-glycans were used to produce secreted, transmembrane domain truncated HAs that have only high mannose residues on their N-glycosylation sites.

Devising a simple method to apply the monoglycosylation concept to egg-based vaccines with minimal modification will allow this procedure to be integrated into established production methods. Extensive testing found that kifunensine, an \u03b1-mannosidase I inhibitor, can be injected into embryonated eggs to convert influenza virus membrane glycoproteins to a uniformly high mannose composition. After harvesting these virions their high mannose N-glycans were then trimmed with endoglycosidase H to create intact monoglycosylated virus particles, and all participating reagents are removed in subsequent purification steps [54].",

Currently, high dose or adjuvanted IIVs are recommended for people 65 years and older, while LAIV is only approved for healthy adults up to the age of 49. On the other end of the spectrum, maternally-derived antibodies generated from inoculation during pregnancy are expected to provide protection for infants < 6 months, so vaccination that elicit a predominantly cell-mediated immune response are unlikely to be of use. Novel strategies for a universal flu vaccine will have to take into account differences in immune response from specific populations that are at higher risk for influenza complications.",

In our previous studies we have only demonstrated the concept that monoglycosylated split virus vaccine induces more stem-specific antibodies directed against conserved epitopes on the HA stem [54]. However, in theory by trimming off oligosaccharides on every N-glycosylation site on the HA, multiple conserved epitopes would be exposed, inducing a multi-faceted immune response that imposes a higher evolutionary barrier for escape mutant generation. Another influenza glycoprotein that could potentially benefit from the monoglycosylation process is NA. The preparation of monoglycosylated split virus vaccine would remove glycans from not only HA but also NA, hypothetically inducing more anti-NA antibodies that interfere with virus budding, disease progression and severity of symptoms [101].",

The production of monoglycosylated split virus vaccine adds two key steps to the traditional egg-based platform.

Endoglycosidase H is added after harvest to trim high mannose residues down to a single GlcNAc. The resultant monoglycosylated split vaccine provides a more diverse immune response and more effective cross-strain protection than conventional egg-based vaccines. HAfg, non-modified egg-based vaccine with complex type N-glycans attached to HA; HAhm, HA with only high mannose type N-glycans; HAmg, HA with a single GlcNAc at its N-glycosylation sites.
