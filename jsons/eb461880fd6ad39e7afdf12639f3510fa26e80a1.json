Third, some methods are unable to inactivate certain pathogens including prions, spores and non enveloped viruses. Fourth, there are continuing concerns over the toxicity of residual chemical agents used in some methods. Finally, there is a perception that available techniques may well lack cost effectiveness when compared with other available interventions to address non infectious transfusion threats. 44 Despite these challenges the potential to remove all infectious agents with a single processing step remains a compelling driver to continue development of these methods. 25 Undoubtedly, blood services worldwide will continue to monitor the progress of pathogen reduction techniques with keen interest.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 169, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 406, "end": 408, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1427, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1601, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interventions"}, {"text": "Infectious diseases in the context of today's 'global village' know no boundaries. The frequency and rapidity of international travel provide an efficient transport mechanism for existing, and perhaps more significantly novel agents.

A co-ordinated international response which bought to bear the combined resources of many jurisdictions as well as the United Nations and the WHO effectively minimised the global impact of the outbreak. The international blood banking community urgently assessed the threat posed by SARS and in the absence of a screening test rapidly implemented donor screening measures to safeguard the blood supply against the unknown potential for transfusion transmission.

If it is considered necessary to prevent such risks prospectively (rather than retrospectively) then 'catch-all' interventions such as pathogen reduction may have to be considered.
