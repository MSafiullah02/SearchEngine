We can see several characteristics in Fig. 2: (i) The theoretical distributions in Fig. 2 are different from those in Fig. 1 and also different one another, this is understandable because the composition of amino acids in each protein differs from that of our imaging protein, which contains equal numbers of 20 types of amino acids, and from other proteins. (ii) There is no actual distribution for STOP codon, which is certainly due to the fact that the premature termination results in a synthesis of deleterious truncated proteins. (iii) Some actual distributions of mutated amino acids are very similar to the theoretical distributions such as isoleucine and threonine in human p53 protein, which at least means that the mutations would not lead to the dysfunction of human p53 proteins if the mutated amino acids would be these types. (iv) Some actual distributions of mutated amino acids are very different from the theoretical distribution such as alanine and arginine in human p53 protein. These phenomena suggest that the mutations lead to the death of human p53 protein if the mutated amino acids would be these types, otherwise we would expect to have seen more records in these mutated amino acids and a smaller difference between the theoretical and actual distributions.",

Selection at the amino-acid level can influence synonymous codon usage [23]. Non-standard genetic codes are genetic codes in which one or more codons have a different amino-acid assignment from that found in the standard genetic code. The diversity of non-standard genetic codes has found in the modern biosphere. The majority of non-standard codes arise from alterations in the tRNA, with most occurring by post-transcriptional modifications, such as base modification or RNA editing, rather than by substitutions within tRNA anticodons [24]. In some ciliate species, it is found that the UAG and UAA codons encode glutamine, and UGA encodes cysteine and tryptophan [25].

Although these proteins vary regarding their composition of amino acids, their function, their location, and so on, a common pattern can be seen in Fig. 3, which is much clearer than the patterns in Fig. 2, for example, the translation probability of 2/16 has the largest frequency of mutated amino acids. On the other hand, we could expect that the translation probability of 2/16 would be the largest in Fig. 3 because this probability appears most frequently (31.15%) among 183 translation probabilities in Table 3. In terms of percentage of frequency among all the mutations, there is no statistical difference between theoretical and actual situations in Table 5\n(p\n = 0.109, Wilcoxon signed rank test). This means that the natural mutation trend goes in principle along the theoretical translation probability listed in Table 3 if the sample is relatively large enough, although we can expect some difference between theoretical and actual mutation frequencies due to the nonsense mutation, dysfunctional mutant, etc.",

The relationships between synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates and between synonymous rate and codon usage bias are important to our understanding of the roles of mutation and selection in the evolutionary process [27]. Synonymous codons differ in their capacity to minimize the effects of errors due to mutation or mistranslation. Natural selection for error minimization at the protein level plays a role in the evolution of coding sequences in Drosophila and rodents [28]. At least 10% of variation in codon bias can be explained by mutation pressure [29]. Furthermore, the effect of selection on individual codons changes over time [30]. The selection pressure is for reduced protein synthesis cost, say, most reassignments give amino acids that are less expensive to synthesize. Mitochondrial genetic codes evolve to match the amino-acid requirements of proteins [31].",
