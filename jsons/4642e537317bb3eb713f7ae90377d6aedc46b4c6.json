            "text": "In the relatively short time span of 3 months since the new coronavirus was identified, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially, from not a single scientific report to over 1600 publications at the time of this writing, across numerous disciplines in the field of medicine, including infectious disease, virology, epidemiology, immunology, critical care medicine, pediatrics, medical education, psychiatry, and surgery. Just now, neurosurgical programs from Wuhan, China, are submitting articles to the Journal describing their experiences combating COVID-19 in their hospitals. According to these reports, endoscopic endonasal skull base procedures should be avoided as much as possible given the high likelihood of aerosolizing virus particles within the nasal sinuses and infecting operating room staff.",

In 2003, the city of Toronto was the site of a large cluster of infected individuals, with over 400 cases documented. Large international meetings planned in Toronto, such as the American Association of Cancer Research annual meeting, the largest cancer research meeting of its kind in the world, were cancelled due to the SARS epidemic. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, virtually all the conferences of organized neurosurgical associations and societies around the world have been either cancelled or postponed. International airplane travel is forbidden in most countries. National travel is being discouraged. Practices of self-isolation and social distancing have become the norm.",

While COVID-19 has limited neurovirulence, its reproductive number (R 0 ) is high, indicating that its transmissibility gives it the potential to infect large proportions of the world population, with enough patients with severe symptoms to overwhelm our healthcare systems, as has been demonstrated in jurisdictions such as northern Italy. The many COVID-19 patients requiring admission to critical care and intensive care units have already led to the prioritization of neurosurgical cases throughout North America.",

In addition, perhaps there will be an increased focus on basic and translational viral science that will lead to more rapid therapeutic responses.",

We provide communications on the impact of COVID-19 on the practice of particular aspects of neurosurgery (Fig. 1) , such as general and spe- cialized adult neurosurgery, spine surgery, and pediatric neurosurgery. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on annual neurosurgical meetings, such as the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), are discussed by Kathleen Craig, Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Shaffrey, President of the AANS. The downstream effects of a reduction in operative experience and formal in-person conferencing on resident education are described in an editorial prepared by neurosurgery residency program directors. In this regard, the importance of web-based conferencing systems has emerged and reached primacy. The effects of COVID-19 on large academic neurosurgical units versus small private neurosurgical practices are compared and contrasted. Members of the Editorial Board of the JNSPG for all three print journals were asked to collate and prepare their experiences in the form of an editorial from across the United States and beyond. And finally, as issues arise when allocating scarce medical resources during pandemics, we present an editorial on the ethics of prioritizing and rationing neurosurgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

While it is important to recognize the impact of COVID-19 on the practice of neurosurgery through this series of rapid communications in the Journal, it will be equally important to \"debrief\" on where we will be 6 to 12 months from now. It is our strong hope that we will be able to codify systems of containment so that we can immediately prevent or minimize the spread of diseases such as COVID-19; that we develop standardized systems of care so that a necessary and required stock of personal protective equipment (PPE) is always available; and that we work together to ensure that the prioritization of the care of acutely ill neurosurgical patients is forever seamless, even at times of limited inpatient hospital resources. Through arduous training processes and previous experiences, neurosurgeons are by nature a resilient group of surgical specialists. Accordingly, we hope to demonstrate that our responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will make our specialty stronger, and better prepared for the future.",
