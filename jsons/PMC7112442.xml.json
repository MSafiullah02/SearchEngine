We visually scored cytopathogenicity induced by the virus 72\u201396 h after infection in 96-well microplates on confluent layers of Vero cells. The selectivity index was determined as the ratio of the concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability to 50% (CC50) to the concentration of the compound needed to inhibit the cytopathic effect to 50% of the control value (EC50).

Glycyrrhizin had a low selectivity index, but was a significantly potent inhibitor of replication of all the viruses tested. The EC50 reported by these authors for glycyrrhizin was 316\u2013625 mg/L (added twice during the incubation period of 7 days). Taking into consideration that the compounds were added twice during the total period of incubation, the EC50 for glycyrrhizin we recorded (table) indicates a higher sensitivity of SARS-CV to this drug than that recorded by Crance and colleagues.",

Infrequent side-effects such as raised blood pressure and hypokalaemia were reported in some patients after several months of glycyrrhizin treatment. Treatment of SARS should only be needed for a short time. Since the side-effects of this compound are known and can be controlled for, proper monitoring could lead to effective use of glycyrrhizin as a treatment for SARS. Booth and colleagues5 reported that ribavirin had many toxic effects when given to patients with SARS, including haemolysis (76% of patients) and a drastic reduction of haemoglobin (49% of patients). However, although high doses of glycyrrhizin have been used in clinical trials, this compound had few toxic effects compared with the other regimens, and the drug was reported to be clinically effective.",
