We did not have an isolate of HKU23 virus available for serological testing and BCoV was used as a virus that is genetically closely related to HKU23 with pairwise amino acid similarity of 94.1% in the spike protein gene, the determinant of antigenic cross-reaction in neutralization tests (Woo et al., 2014) . Horse sera obtained from the USA reported to be strongly reactive by ELISA (optical density ranging from 1.458 to 1.939) for ECoV showed high titre (>1,280) for ECoV in MN assay as expected, but also had high antibody titres (ranging from 160 to 1,280) in BCoV MN tests (Table 5) . As these horse sera were from horses in the \"field,\" they may well have been exposed to multiple coronaviruses. Thus, these results may reflect cross-reactivity or coinfection of US horses with ECoV-and BCoV-like viruses. Two of these sera showed low titres (20) in the MERS-CoV ppNT assay but were negative in the more stringent MERS-CoV MN assay. As MERS-CoV is not circulating in the USA, these results suggest crossreactivity between MERS-CoV and ECoV or related CoVs may occur, albeit at low titre. Similarly, a BCoV immune serum from an experimentally infected gnotobiotic calf showed detectable, but 16-fold reduced antibody titre with ECoV but no cross-reaction with MERS-CoV. Spike proteins of equine coronavirus and bovine coronavirus have an overall amino acid similarity of 80.8% and 73.1% similarity of the S1 region which contains the receptor-binding domain and neutralization epitopes. This probably explains the large difference in neutralization titres observed in Table 5 . A dromedary serum from Kazakhstan, a region known to be free of MERS-CoV activity (Miguel et al., 2016) , had detectable antibody to BCoV (probably reflecting HKU23 or BCoV infection) and also to ECoV. We cannot conclude whether this reflects cross-reactivity or infection with BCoV, HKU23 and/or ECoV. None of the beta coronavirus immune sera to SARS-CoV or mouse hepatitis virus, nor immune sera to alpha or gamma coronaviruses gave cross-reactions in BCoV or ECoV MN assays (Table 5) .

All these reference sera, as well as additional ECoV immune sera and MERS-CoV-negative camel sera, were tested in ppNT or MN assays in parallel against MERS-CoV, BCoV, as well as ECoV, to assess possible cross-reactive antibody All nasal and rectal swabs were tested using the pan-coronavirus nested RT-PCR assay, ECoV and MERS-CoV upE gene RT-qPCR assays. All swabs were negative in the MERS-CoV RTqPCR assay. mal species in new geographic areas. Our initial focus was to explore for evidence of MERS-CoV infections in horses in Saudi Arabia and Oman. None of the rectal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV RNA, but the application of the pan-coronavirus RT-PCR to these specimens revealed the presence of two other coronaviruses infecting horses in this region, that is ECoV and HKU23. Phylogenetic analysis of equine coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus/dromedary camel coronavirus HKU23 cluster. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree rooted to HKU1 as an outgroup was generated using virus RdRp gene alignment of 934 nt by PhyML with approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) SH-like branch support.

This serum did not have any detectable antibody to ECoV or BCoV.However, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that this observation reflects cross-reaction with ECoV, BCoV or other yet unknown coronaviruses. Confirmation of natural infection of horses with MERS-CoV can only come from detection of MERS-CoV RNA in horse specimens.
