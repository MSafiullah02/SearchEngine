Priority level 3 radiation patients include those with category 2 (less aggressive) tumors where RT is the first definitive treatment. 5 Uveal melanoma meets these high-priority criteria because: (1) it is highly lethal, with approximately an overall 50% rate of metastasis 6,7 ; (2) outcomes are potentially worse if ocular treatment is delayed [6] [7] [8] ; and (3) ocular radiotherapy is highly effective at achieving local tumor control (e.g., >95% rate of local tumor control after 4-5 fractions of proton beam radiotherapy (PBRT)). 6, 9, 10 Noteworthy, proton eye therapy for UM is delivered with significant hypofractionation (12-15 Gray Equivalent fractional dose) and thus in full accordance with the recently released radiotherapy guidelines during the pandemic. 11, 12 In this document, we list practice considerations to limit COVID-19 transmission in the proton ocular treatment setting for UM.

Consider alternatives: Enucleation, other types of radiation therapy, or surveillance may or may not be appropriate in select cases, depending on OR/personnel/equipment availability, tumor/patient factors, physician assessment, type/severity of risk, etc. In some patients (e.g., those with small, genetically favorable tumors or localized iris tumors), outcomes may not be compromised if treatment is delayed until the risk of infection has subsided. For patients who have undergone surgical tantalum clip placement already, clinical consideration must be given to timing of definitive treatment. In addition, if travel/hotel stay for 4-5 days treatment course is required for patients, this may or may not be feasible given local conditions/national quarantine policies. 15 Importantly, it is not known whether a delay of several months significantly increases any risk of metastasis for an individual patient. This uncertainty exists even when tumor biopsy has been performed, whatever the results of genetic tumor analysis.
