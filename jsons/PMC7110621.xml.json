Epidemic intelligence (EI) for emerging infections is the process of identifying key information on emerging infectious diseases, specific incidents, and outbreaks. The importance of EI is recognized globally, and it is central to the surveillance component of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) to protect the global community from public health risks and emergencies that cross international borders (WHO, 2005a). EI generally integrates both indicator-based (collection of structured data through surveillance systems) and event-based (unstructured data from formal and informal sources) components in a single surveillance system (Paquet et al., 2006). It can be based solely on event-based data, which is usually more valued as it has the ability to detect the earliest reports of events and undiagnosed diseases.",

Flexibility in scope of sources is a fundamental aspect of the system and allows for a degree of adaptation when responding to incidents, e.g. enhanced monitoring of journals (particularly those with rapid publication capabilities) for diseases that are poorly understood and for which case reports and early laboratory studies can provide essential information and evidence to inform guidance and policy. The fact that the top three sources varied considerably by disease demonstrates the importance of monitoring a variety of different sources. The increased demand for epidemic intelligence during major incidents by risk managers and other policy-makers can put a large strain on resources; however these systems are an essential component of evidence gathering to inform risk assessments, preparedness, guidance, and policy. Although EI systems need to be expansive in their scope to detect emerging incidents, the end use of the data may allow for rationalization of that scope during periods of increased demand.",

They search in many languages and pull in information from specified sites. Although these \u2018collection\u2019 systems are used by large organizations such as the WHO and US CDC, what this type of automation struggles to do is turn the information gathered into usable intelligence. A well-known example of the limitations of automated \u2018big data analysis\u2019 systems to provide accurate, usable information is Google Flu Trends (Lazer et al., 2014). These automated systems generate listings of hundreds/thousands of reports every day, even when specific search terms are utilized. This volume of information will contain a high degree of \u2018noise\u2019 (Khan et al., 2012, Barboza et al., 2014). Generating usable intelligence requires additional processing and input including deduplication, translation, interpretation, and verification (Barboza et al., 2014, Fisichella et al., 2011).
