Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (-45 to -51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (-28 to -31.0%). By contrast, O 3 levels increased (+33 to +57% of the 8h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O 3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. Relevant differences in the meteorology of these two periods were also evidenced. The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO 2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30 th . There are still open questions on why PM10 levels were much less reduced than BC and NO 2 and on what is the proportion of the abatement of pollution directly related to the lockdown, without meteorological interferences.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain were identified in late February 2020 (Saglietto et al., 2020) .

Urban NO 2 is emitted from combustion processes, mostly road traffic in urban areas, especially diesel and, to a lesser extent, gasoline, vehicles, industry, power generation, and shipping. Although the main source of PM10 in the urban background of Barcelona is road traffic (around 30 % of the annual mean) (Amato et al., 2016) , other important sources are industrial sources, harbor emissions, construction works, dust resuspension, and Saharan dust episodes. The latter occurred before and during the lockdown period, from February 28 th to March 1 st and March 18 th to 24 th , respectively, and this has influenced the variation of PM10. This might have reduced the decrease of PM10 when compared with that of NO 2 , but in addition, other causes could also contributed.
