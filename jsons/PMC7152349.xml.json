            "text": "The family Mustelidae contains numerous fully terrestrial species, two that are semi-aquatic (minks), and a number that are amphibious to fully aquatic (the Lutrinae). The latter have adaptations for the aquatic habits that may be relevant for the clinical management. Underwater vision presents challenges for the mammalian eye: the need for increased sensitivity to light, accommodation of the spectral shift toward the blue-green wavelengths, and modification of the ocular focusing capacity because of refractive differences compared with those in air. Different adaptations for these challenges have been proposed, although visual acuity in water is somewhat reduced in some otter species (i.e., Asian small-clawed otter). Little is known of the importance, sensitivity, and mechanisms of hearing in otters, in the aquatic or the terrestrial environment. Olfaction has been retained as an important sense for aquatic mustelids, largely but not exclusively in support of their activities on land. However, evidence suggests that otters have less complex scent production capacities compared with terrestrial mustelids and that scent production capacity in sea otters may be more poorly developed and less important than in other otter species. These changes probably have resulted from the increased importance of vision and the reduced importance of olfaction in the aquatic environment. The long, lean body of Mustelinae species makes them vulnerable to rapid heat loss on land and in the water. Insulation in aquatic mustelids is achieved by means of a dense underfur that prevents water penetration to the skin while providing buoyancy. Because fur is an efficient insulator, furred aquatic mammals require some means of thermoregulation; in sea otters, thermoregulation is conducted through the enlarged rear flippers. In otters and minks, swimming is the primary means of locomotion. These species demonstrate many adaptations that enhance swimming performance and reduce energy expenditure while in the water: body streamlining, large, specialized plantar surfaces for propulsion, and the ability to remain submerged for extended periods. However, most otters, unlike most aquatic mammals, are capable of quadrupedal locomotion on land, and this is why they are considered morphologically intermediate between terrestrial and aquatic mammals.12\n",

Exhibits that are provided extensive enrichment and are structurally varied may be smaller than exhibits lacking these characteristics. (Note that enrichment items must be chosen carefully, since many mustelid species are prone to chewing and ingesting enrichment parts, putting them at risk of gastrointestinal [GI] foreign body obstruction). Recommended exhibit sizes are based on species size, behavioral repertoire, home range size, daily movements, and activity patterns.

Additionally, mustelids are not well suited for free-ranging exhibits because of their uncanny ability to escape.

Outdoor exhibits should have containment perimeters, tops and hotwire 3 to 5 feet (ft.; 1\u20131.52 meters [m]) installed above ground level to prevent them from climbing and falling. For burrowing species (e.g., badgers), the bottom of the containment fence may need to be buried to a sufficient depth and angled toward the center of the exhibit to prevent escape. For amphibious species (e.g., otters), optimal land-to-water ratios are species dependent. These ratios may need to be changed as exhibit size increases or decreases (e.g., smaller exhibits will require a higher land area proportion within the ratio).3, 4\n",

            "text": "Within the Mustelidae family, food habits vary significantly. Some are strict carnivores (ferrets, weasels, polecats, etc.), some are omnivorous (skunks, badgers or tayras), and some are piscivorous (fish and crustacean eaters such as otters) (see Table 48-1). Mustelids have a relatively simple stomach and a short GI tract and, as mentioned above, no cecum. The more omnivorous species have flattened molars. Captive mustelid species are fed on a great variety of items: commercial dry dog food, mink food, and cat food, and cereal diets mixed with meat, fresh or frozen fish, shellfish, crabs, and crayfish. Fruits, vegetables (carrots, lettuce, green beans, cucumber, collard greens, kale, potatoes, among others), eggs, and live or killed food items (crickets, mealworms, mice, prairie dogs) have also been incorporated into captive diets. Target dietary nutrient values for mustelids are based on several sources. The cat is typically the model species used to establish nutrient guidelines for strict carnivorous animals. The National Research Council (NRC, 2006, for dogs and cats), and Association of American Feed Control Officials (1994, for cats) have provided recommendations. A limited amount of information has been provided by the NRC publication on mink and foxes, which represents the requirements of another mustelid species (Table 48-2\n). The complete dietary requirements of domestic ferrets are still unknown, so no one particular diet is currently being recommended over another. In the ferret and mink diet, the protein should be of high quality and easily digestible because of their short GI transit time of 3 to 4 hours. Generally, most mustelids need a diet high in good-quality meat protein and fat and low in complex carbohydrates, inclusive of sugars, and fiber. High levels of protein from plant sources have been associated with urolithiasis in mustelids and are therefore undesirable. Food should be offered at least twice a day, and water must be available at all times. When developing appropriate dietary management plans for a specific mustelid species, the following should be considered: feeding ecology, target nutrient values, food items available at zoos, and information collected from diets offered by institutions successfully maintaining and breeding for the species.",

            "text": "Different drugs have been used extensively for the chemical immobilization of mustelids. In most species, dissociative-benzodiazepine\u2013 \u03b12-agonists combinations have been used and are highly recommended for induction or short-term anesthesia. Ketamine in combination with midazolam, diazepam, xylazine, medetomidine, or acepromazine (caution: hyperthermia or hypothermia) to improve muscle relaxation. Xylazine, medetomidine, or dexmedetomidine combined with ketamine has been recommended to improve muscle relaxation, and both combinations may be reversed with atipamezole (2.5 milligram [mg] per 5 mg medetomidine, and 1 mg per 8\u201312 mg xylazine).2, 13, 27 Tiletamine\u2013zolazepam is another option. Doses ranging from 2.2 to 22 mg/kg have been reported for numerous species of mustelids; higher doses result in prolonged recovery. In otters, the usage of a low dose of tiletamine\u2013zolazepam to achieve anesthetic induction, and supplementation with isoflurane or ketamine (5 mg/kg) for maintenance, has been advocated. Flumazemil (0.05\u20130.1 mg/kg) may be used to antagonize the zolazepam portion of this combination to hasten recovery, but its usage has not been reported in mustelids other than the Nearctic river otter.38 Drugs and dosages commonly used to provide chemical restraint and sedation in selected mustelids are listed in Table 48-3\n. These combinations usually provide short periods of chemical restraint (30\u201345 minutes). If longer periods of anesthesia are needed, inhalation anesthetics (isoflurane and sevoflurane) delivered via an induction chamber, mask, or endotracheal tube is efficient, although the results of chamber induction with inhalation agents may vary and cause excitement in some species. Otters hypoventilate during inhalation anesthesia and require assisted ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercarbia.26\n",

Mustelids have varying susceptibility (species and exposure dependent) to feline panleukopenia, canine distemper, rabies, and leptospirosis.10 Most authors recommend vaccination of mustelids against rabies and canine distemper. Safety and efficacy of modified live canine distemper vaccinations in exotic species of carnivores has been historically problematic because vaccine-induced distemper has occurred (e.g., a modified-live virus derived from chick embryo cell culture caused the death of four female black-footed ferrets [Mustela nigripes], or protection was not achieved). In the past, killed distemper vaccines have not provided longstanding protection in most species. A recombinant canarypox-vectored canine distemper vaccine (Purevax, Merial, Athens, GA) has been shown to be safe and efficacious and is the best choice for general mustelid protection against canine distemper virus.41 If an alternative modified-live canine distemper vaccine is used, it should be given separately and not in multiple forms, since immunosuppression and other untoward vaccine interactions might lead to disease. Ferret or mink cell culture-derived modified-live vaccines should never be used in mustelids. A modified-live canine distemper vaccine of primate kidney tissue cell origin, Onderstepoort type, is available in the United States (Galaxy D; Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, Omaha, NE) and has been proven to be safe and efficacious in hybrid black-footed ferrets and Siberian polecats. The only vaccine approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for ferrets, Fervac-D (United Vaccines, Madison, WI), which is an egg-adapted strain, has induced anaphylactoid and anaphylactic reactions in some mustelids, so its use is not recommended.",
