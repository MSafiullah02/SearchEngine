            "text": "In her review, Kikkert [1] discusses the arms race between host innate immunity and evasion of this immunity by respiratory viruses. Infections with respiratory viruses such as influenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus are an important problem in the general population, as well as in subjects with chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas infection with corona viruses (CoVs) such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and bird flucausing avian influenza have made the headlines in the media in recent years. Suppression of antiviral defenses is a strategy employed by most viruses, and insight into the mechanisms underlying this evasion is essential to better prevent and treat respiratory viral infections. With a focus on RNA viruses, she illustrates how viruses escape recognition by intracellular sensors, use enzymatic activity to suppress innate immunity, and how viruses manipulate the ubiquitin system. One of the mechanisms by which pathogens can be cleared is autophagy, and the role of autophagy in innate immunity is the topic of the review by Rao and Eissa [2] . This intracellular digestion system not only contributes to host defense against respiratory infection, but is also essential for maintaining cellular function by degrading macromolecules and dysfunctional organelles, and by generating nutrients in case of nutrient starvation. Dysfunction of autophagy leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in stressed cells, which may result in inflammation. This review serves both as an introduction to autophagy as an intracellular recycling system, as well as a detailed discussion of its relation to lung innate immunity including the way it controls unwanted activation of the inflammasome. The discussion on how some pathogens may evade clearance by autophagy stresses the role of autophagy in host defense against infection, and further broadens the scope of mechanisms discussed by Kikkert [1] that allow viruses to escape cellular defense systems.",

            "text": "Following this series of reviews covering various aspects of innate immunity of the lung, and elaborating on themes such as escape mechanisms allowing pathogens to evade innate immunity, the role of metabolic reprogramming, and therapeutic prospects of unravelling innate immunity, this issue of the Journal of Innate Immunity also includes 5 original research papers focused on epithelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Microbial recognition is central in innate immunity to respiratory infection, and Toll-like receptors (TLR) are an essential part of the pulmonary toolbox of innate immunity that enables it to sense pathogen presence. Grassin-Delyle et al. [5] studied expression and function of TLRs on human lung macrophages isolated from resected lung tissue. Expression of the diverse repertoire of TLRs and response to subtypespecific TLR agonists revealed a remarkably wide spectrum. Interestingly, little interpatient variation was observed in TLR expression levels, with the exception of TLR8. M1 polarization was not only observed in response to LPS, but also to a range of other TLR agonists. The use of primary human macrophages isolated from resected lung tissue is a particular strength of this study, revealing important differences with, for example, studies using lung macrophages derived from mice. In addition to macrophages and other lung cells, the airway epithelial cells that line the airway lumen also use a range of TLRs to monitor microbial presence at the epithelial surface, and this may lead to an enhanced production of antimicrobial pep-tides (AMPs) that serve as effector molecules of innate immunity by killing micro-organisms, modulating immunity, and enhancing wound repair. Importantly, vitamin D is now also recognized as a regulator of production of selected AMPs such as the human cathelicidin LL-37. Schrumpf et al. [6] used differentiated cultures of airway epithelial cells to show that vitamin D increases the production of AMPs such as hCAP18/LL-37, but that this is reduced by TGF-\u03b21. Expression of the multifunctional cytokine and growth factor TGF-\u03b21 is increased in various lung diseases, including COPD. They went on to show that TGF-\u03b21 modulates epithelial cell metabolism of vitamin D by increasing expression of the vitamin D-degrading enzyme CYP24A1, and also reduces the expression of a range of constitutively produced host defense molecules in part by skewing epithelial differentiation towards a reduction in secretory cells. One of the host defense molecules that was regulated by TGF-\u03b21 in the study of Schrumpf et al. [6] , the antimicrobial proteinase inhibitor secretory leucoprotease inhibitor (SLPI), is the central research topic of the study by McKiernan et al. [7] . SLPI, which also displays immunomodulatory effects, is not only produced by epithelial cells, but also by monocytes, amongst others. Sexrelated differences in chronic inflammatory diseases and susceptibility to respiratory infections are the background of their study. They demonstrate that estrogen decreases the expression of SLPI by monocytes, and provide evidence that this is mediated by an increase in miR-19. Thereby, they delineate one of the mechanisms by which estrogen modulates the innate immune system.",

[8] studied the role of Tollip in rhinovirus infection in a type 2 cytokine environment to mimic conditions in allergic asthma, where rhinovirus contributes to exacerebations. Tollip was previously found to control activation of IRAK1, which acts downstream not only of TLRs and the IL-1 receptor, but also mediates signaling of the IL-33 receptor ST2. Using human primary epithelial cells and mouse models, they showed how Tollip restricts IL-8 production in response to rhinovirus infection in the presence of type 2 allergic inflammatory conditions, and demonstrated involvement of Tollip in the production of soluble ST2 that can restrict the activity of IL-33. Finally, the study by Yue et al. [9] also focused on a type 2 cytokine environment and epithelial cells. They studied the regulation of inflammatory cytokines and mucus production by nasal epithelial cells in allergic rhinitis.
