Although cytomegalovirus (CMV) rarely develops as a primary infection, reactivation of a previous CMV infection or the development of a superinfection often occur in transplant patients. It has been shown that CMV can lead to the development of bacterial and fungal superinfections by trigger cellular immunosuppression in solid organ transplant patients with a history of CMV infection [2, 3]. However, concomitant CMV infection and Aspergillus spp. pneumonia have rarely been documented [4]. There are only 7 cases to date in the literature. The diagnosis of coexisting infections is difficult and, thus, may delay the initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment. We report the successful treatment of this coinfection in a renal transplant recipient.",

The immediate postoperative period was unremarkable and he did not experience delayed graft function. He was administered antithymocyte globulin (ATG Fresenius, rabbit antiglobulin) 2 mg/kg for 10 days and methylprednisolone.

He was on valacyclovir 500 mg thrice a day for CMV prophylaxis. He was seropositive for CMV; however, the CMV status of the donor was not known at the time of transplantation.

Physical examination findings at admission were as follows: body temperature 38.8 \u00b0C, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per min, regular. His heart sounds were rhythmic, and no murmurs were heard. There were inspiratory crackles at both lung bases. Abdomen examination was unremarkable, organomegaly was not detected. There was no pedal edema. Laboratory parameters at admission were as follows: blood glucose: 154 mg/dl, urea: 41 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.66 mg/dl, sodium: 135 mEq/l, potassium: 4.3 mEq/l, calcium: 7.3 mg/dl, phosphorus: 1.3 mg/dl, magnesium: 2 mg/dl, total cholesterol: 96 mg/dl, triglycerides: 83 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol: 55 mg/dl, AST: 21 U/l, ALT: 13 U/l, hsCRP: 37 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 27 mm/h, white blood cell count: 2180/mm3, hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dl, and platelet count: 74 \u00d7 103/mm3. Urinalysis revealed +WBC, ++++RBC, protein (\u2212), and nitrites (\u2212). Once blood cultures had been taken, the patient was administered imipenem on an empirical basis. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest revealed increased ground-glass opacities at both lung bases, scattered cavitary lesions in both lungs, the largest of which measured 19 \u00d7 15 mm in diameter, consolidation with air bronchogram on superior segment of the right lower lung, and minimal pleural effusion on the right side (Fig. 1). Galactomannan antigen was found to be positive. Voriconazole (400 mg twice daily loading and 200 mg twice daily maintenance doses) was added to his treatment. During the course of the hospitalization, he experienced unilateral leg swelling and pain. Doppler ultrasound revealed acute deep vein thrombosis and the patient was administered low-molecular-weight heparin.\n",

In the absence of any preventive therapy, 30\u201375 % of transplant recipients develop CMV infection, and the reported incidence of CMV disease is 8\u201330 % [6]. CMV disease is defined as \u201cCMV infection manifesting with signs and symptoms of fever, malaise, leukopenia, and/or documented CMV invasive disease into organs\u201d. The most frequent presentations of CMV disease are fever (58 %), pneumonitis (26.3 %), and enterocolitis (15.8 %) [7]. Most infections are associated with the reactivation of latent CMV [8]. Most complications of this infection occur in the first 6 month after engraftment [9]. The virus can influence the production of various cytokines and chemokines that can inhibit natural killer and T cell responses, as well as target humoral immune responses; in fact, it is these immunomodulatory properties that may be responsible for the indirect consequences of CMV infection [6]. The increased incidence of concurrent opportunistic viral, fungal, and bacterial infections in the setting of CMV infection has been well characterized in the literature. The immunomodulatory properties of CMV are attributed to solid organ transplant recipients\u2019 increased vulnerability to these infections [5]. To our knowledge, coinfection of Aspergillus spp. and CMV has been reported in 7 cases in the literature to date. The patient and disease characteristics of these cases are depicted in Table 1. Some common features of reported cases were as follows: most of the cases were middle-aged males who received a deceased donor renal transplantation. Seven out of 8 cases presented within 3 months after transplantation. Six of 8 cases were treated with amphotericin B and 7 out of 8 cases were treated with i.v. ganciclovir (Table 1). The intensity of maintenance immunosuppression was reduced in all cases and 3 out of 8 patients died, while 1 patient lost his renal graft and returned to dialysis. Interestingly, in 4 of these 7 cases, there was no mention with regards to CMV prophylaxis, while 2 patients were not given prophylaxis against CMV. In our patient, CMV infection developed despite appropriate prophylactic treatment with oral valganciclovir.\n",

The occurrence of invasive fungal infections is highest in the early posttransplant period, when immunosuppression is greatest. The prevalence of invasive fungal infections has decreased over the last decade, due, in a large part, to improvements in transplant surgical methods [10]. Invasive fungal infections following kidney transplantation are rare, occurring in only 1\u201314 % of kidney transplants [11]. Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. account for more than 80 % of invasive fungal infections in solid organ recipients [12]. Invasive Aspergillus spp. infection is a devastating complication following solid organ transplantation, with associated high mortality. It typically develops within the first 12 months and is most often seen within the first 3 months after transplantation [2]. Presenting symptoms are usually nonspecific, including low-grade fever, weight loss, fatigue, and dry cough [13]. A recent study reported an incidence of aspergillosis after solid organ transplant of 0.65 %, and the 12-month survival after infection was 59 % for patients with invasive aspergillosis [14]. Another study revealed autopsy findings and clinical associates of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [15]. Forty-one percent of the patients had no respiratory symptoms. Fungal etiology was not entertained clinically in any of the patients. The major associated conditions were prolonged antibiotic therapy, steroid therapy, renal transplantation, and underlying lung disease",

Autopsy studies in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis revealed angioinvasion [15]. The mechanism of arterial obstruction during invasive aspergillosis remains hypothetical. It was suggested that aggregation of the fungus cells in the intima stimulates endothelial cells to become prothrombotic by expressing thromboplastin that activates factor II and initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade [17]. We think that the reason behind why aspergillosis facilitated the development of thrombosis was the low risk profile of our patient for deep vein thrombosis development.
