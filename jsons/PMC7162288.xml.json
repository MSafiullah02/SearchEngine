            "text": "Poliovirus (PV) infection leads to plasma membrane permeabilization and proliferation of intracellular vesicles in which viral replication complexes are assembled (Bienz et al., 1992; Schlegel et al., 1996). PV 2B protein and its precursor 2BC are the main effectors of membrane leakiness, and together with 3A protein, they induce a significant rearrangement of internal cellular membranes (Aldabe and Carrasco, 1995; Suhy et al., 2000; Choe et al., 2005). PV 2B has been previously described as a genuine member of the viroporin family that is able to permeabilize bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells to ions and small molecules (Aldabe et al., 1996; van Kuppeveld et al., 1997; Agirre et al., 2002). Viroporins are small proteins encoded by animal viruses and contain at least one membrane\u2010spanning domain (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 1998; Ye and Hogue, 2007; Gan et al., 2008). The main function of these very hydrophobic proteins during the viral life cycle is to facilitate the release of viral particles from cells (Klimkait et al., 1990; van Kuppeveld et al., 1997; Sanz et al., 2003). Viroporins assemble in homopolymers to form ion channels in cellular membranes and they constitute a target for antiviral drug development (Pinto et al., 1992; Ewart et al., 1996; Melton et al., 2002; Pavlovic et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004; Madan et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2008; Pielak et al., 2009). Recently, the three\u2010dimensional structure of a viroporin has been unravelled (Luik et al., 2009). Electron microscopy studies revealed that hexamers of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 viroporin assemble to form a flower\u2010shaped structure with protruding petals oriented towards the ER lumen. These studies are not only of fundamental interest to understand viroporin architecture, but may also aid in the design of antiviral compounds against p7 protein. Indeed, HCV p7 is a key target to develop compounds that block HCV infection (Pavlovic et al., 2003; Griffin et al., 2008). Apart from HCV p7, picornavirus 2B is one of the best\u2010characterized viroporins (van Kuppeveld et al., 1997; Agirre et al., 2002). We recently reported that an amphipathic peptide spanning 2B residues 35\u201355 effectively allows diffusion of solutes with a molecular weight under 1 kDa both in mammalian cells and in boundary liposomes (Madan et al., 2007). In that study,addition of the peptide to patch\u2010clamped natural plasma membrane induced ion channel activity, indicating that this region of 2B is endowed with pore\u2010forming activity. In a comparative study of the ability of different viroporins to permeabilize the plasma membrane of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, PV 2B together with E protein from mouse hepatitis virus powerfully and rapidly induced permeabilization, whereas other viroporins such as HCV p7, influenza A virus M2 or 6K from Sindbis virus (SV) were less effective or required longer expression to achieve similar membrane alterations in BHK cells (Madan, 2008). To date, a combination of electrophysiological measurements and studies involving entry of unpermeant translation inhibitors, such as hygromycin B (HB), in cells expressing a specific viral product has allowed pore\u2010forming proteins to be distinguished from other viral proteins with cytotoxic properties, both in prokaryotic and in eukaryotic cells (Guinea and Carrasco, 1994; Wang et al., 1994; Ewart et al., 1996; Barco and Carrasco, 1998; Gonzalez and Carrasco, 1998; Wilson et al., 2004; Madan et al., 2005). In the last few years, certain viral proteins such as E and 3a from coronavirus and Vpr from HIV\u20101 have been reported to be released from mammalian cells to the extracellular medium (Maeda et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2008). However, their function either as soluble or integral membrane proteins in secreted lipid vesicles is still largely unknown. Extracellular Vpr has been shown to deregulate expression of various cytokines and inflammatory proteins, as well as to induce cell death in uninfected bystander cells (Huang et al., 2000; Moon and Yang, 2006; Xiao et al., 2008). Here, we investigate whether 2B protein is released from transfected cells to the extracellular medium and whether it permeabilizes non\u2010transfected neighbouring cells. Our findings reveal that 2B expression in a small proportion of BHK cells induces substantial permeabilization to HB in healthy neighbouring cells. We provide compelling evidence to support the hypothesis that 2B\u2010mediated bystander permeabilization of neighbouring cells takes place via HB passage through connexin gap junctions.",

            "text": "Expression of PV 2B induces membrane permeabilization to ions and small molecules (e.g. nucleotides, Ca2+ ions or antibiotics such as HB) in mammalian cells to a similar extent as in the mid\u2010phase of virus infection (van Kuppeveld et al., 1997). In previous works we noted that even though a low percentage of BHK cells was transfected with SV\u2010derived replicons coding for 2B, the whole cell culture was almost entirely permeabilized. To assess membrane permeabilization to the translation inhibitor HB in cells neighbouring 2B\u2010expressing cells, decreasing proportions of 2B\u2010transfected cells were co\u2010cultured with non\u2010transfected cells. Membrane permeabilization was assayed by protein labelling with [35S] Met/Cys at different time points. In the presence of HB, protein synthesis is expected to occur only in non\u2010transfected neighbouring cells, while those that express 2B are permeable to the inhibitor and do not synthesize cellular proteins. We found that neighbouring cells were powerfully permeabilized to HB (\u223c50% translation inhibition) from 5 h post electroporation (hpe) when cultured with 2B\u2010expressing cells at ratios as low as 1:8 (Fig. 1A and C). By 8 hpe, translation of healthy cells was reduced to 20% compared with controls, indicating increased entry of HB (see right graph in Fig. 1C). Increasing proportions of viroporin\u2010expressing cells (from 1/4 or 25%) led to an almost complete permeabilization of neighbouring cells to HB from 5 hpe. Simultaneously, immunofluorescence assays using specific antibodies against 2B protein were performed in order to visualize the presence of the viral protein in these co\u2010cultures (Fig. 1B). PV 2B was not detected in the majority of cultured cells, with only an estimated 25% of cells displaying 2B protein specific fluorescence.",

These findings support the notion that healthy cells were permeable to HB when co\u2010cultured with cells that express PV 2B or 2BC. Moreover, the extent of permeabilization to HB in neighbouring cells was directly dependent on the proportion of 2B\u2010expressing cells that were co\u2010cultured as well as on the length of incubation. However, at 19 hpe, when signs of apoptosis are evident and cell death occurs in a high proportion of cells that express 2B (Madan et al., 2008), permeabilization of healthy counterparts was found to be significantly lower than that seen at earlier time points (data not shown). These differences strongly suggest that the permeabilization of healthy cells requires the 2B\u2010expressing cells to still be alive.",

            "text": "A comparative analysis was carried out using E protein from MHV\u2010A59 and 6K from SV to study whether other viroporins can permeabilize healthy neighbouring cells. PV 2B and coronavirus E proteins have been described to induce a rapid and efficient permeabilization of BHK cells, whereas SV 6K required a longer period of expression to permeabilize the plasma membrane extensively. In addition, a small and cytotoxic protein from HCV, NS4A, exhibited viroporin\u2010like activity several hours after its expression in BHK cells (Madan et al., 2008). To analyse membrane permeabilization of healthy cells to HB at different times by several viroporin\u2010expressing cells, we carried out assays using the co\u2010culture system. BHK cells were electroporated with the corresponding SV\u2010derived replicons (RNAs) coding for either SV C alone, 2B, E, NS4A or 6K. Equal proportions of transfected and non\u2010tranfected cells were mixed and seeded, and translation inhibition by HB was quantified at 8 hpe (C, 2B, E and NS4A) or 16 hpe (6K). Figure 2 shows a representative PAGE analysis in which C protein and viroporin synthesis was detected by metabolic protein labelling. The presence of NS4A was also confirmed by Western blotting, using a specific monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Expression of coronavirus E protein permeabilized transfected cells and also resulted in HB entry in neighbouring cells to a slightly lesser extent than observed in PV 2B co\u2010cultures. The permeabilization activity induced by HCV NS4A expression was delayed compared with that seen upon 2B or E protein expression (Madan et al., 2008). Consequently, HB entry in non\u2010transfected cells was notably impaired, as occurred in co\u2010cultures expressing the non\u2010permeabilizing C protein from SV. In contrast, permeabilization of healthy cells that were co\u2010cultured with 6K\u2010expressing cells for 16 h was unexpectedly lower than that seen in the 2B or E co\u2010cultures, even though 6K\u2010expressing cells were entirely permeabilized (Fig. 2, right panel). These findings reveal the different capabilities of the viroporins tested to promote permeabilization of neighbouring cells. Moreover, this may reflect the different viroporin activity of each viral protein.",

Huh\u20107 and HeLa tumour cell lines were mixed with 2B\u2010transfected BHK cells at different ratios (a total of 3 \u00d7 105 cells), and entry of HB was assayed at 8 hpe. Significant permeabilization of Huh\u20107 cells (\u223c55% translation inhibition by HB) was accomplished when at least 75% of the mixed cell population were transfected BHK cells (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3). Assays using BHK/HeLa cell co\u2010cultures revealed that 50% 2B\u2010expressing BHK cells was sufficient to induce the same extent of permeabilization in HeLa cells as in Huh\u20107 cells (Fig. S3\u20101). In contrast to the results obtained with co\u2010cultures only composed of BHK cells (Fig. 1), co\u2010cultures containing less than 50% or 75% transfected BHK cells did not result in substantial permeabilization of neighbouring tumour cells. These results suggest that in addition to the viroporin activity of 2B, permeabilization to HB of non\u2010transfected cells is also influenced by the neighbouring cell line.",

As shown in Fig. 4, although transfected Huh\u20107 cells were powerfully permeabilized at 8 hpe, the neighbouring cells exhibited little permeabilization to HB. In this case, 2B protein synthesized from 50% transfected cells only promoted a weak permeabilization of the non\u2010transfected counterparts, leading to a translation inhibition of about 40%. However, in BHK\u2010cell co\u2010cultures, equal and even lower ratios of 2B\u2010expressing BHK cells gave rise to almost total permeabilization of neighbouring cells. Co\u2010cultures of HeLa cells cannot be assayed, since this cell line is not permissive for SV or its replicons. Taken together these observations strongly suggest that cellular factors might be involved both in the enhancement and resistance to HB permeabilization of non\u2010transfected cells.",

            "text": "To examine whether cell contact is involved in mediating the transfer of HB from cells expressing 2B protein to bystander cells, we co\u2010cultured mixtures of BHK cells at various densities. Co\u2010cultures including a fixed proportion of 25% 2B\u2010expressing cells and 75% healthy cells were seeded on plates with different growth areas. As shown in Fig. 5A, the permeabilization of neighbouring cells by 2B at 8 hpe proved to be directly proportional to the cell density (confluency) of the co\u2010cultures. This finding suggests that contact between cells that express 2B and non\u2010transfected cells is important for the bystander permeabilization effect to occur. To further assess the significance of intercellular communication in cell permeabilization, we used similar co\u2010cultures in which there was no direct contact between the two cell populations (see schemes in Fig. 5B). Although both cell types shared the same culture medium, when HB entry was evaluated at 8 hpe only the cells expressing 2B protein were permeabilized (Fig. 5B). This finding makes it unlikely that permeabilization of cultured cells is mediated by release of 2B alone or 2B\u2010containing vesicles into the culture medium. Moreover, 2B was not detected in the supernatant obtained from the culture medium of transfected cells at 8 hpe (Fig. 5C). Under these experimental conditions, no cell lysis was observed after expression of viral proteins, as both C protein and \u03b1\u2010tubulin were absent in the supernatants. Detection of E protein from MHV in the culture medium served as a positive control to confirm that proteins can be released from E\u2010expressing cells (Maeda et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Once it was established that permeabilization of neighbouring cells by 2B\u2010expressing cells was not mediated by the release of 2B to the medium and required cell\u2013cell contact, we explored the possibility that HB transfer occurred through gap junctions. In order to study gap junctional communication, BHK cells were labelled with two fluorescent probes, DiI and calcein AM (acetomethyl ester). DiI is a hydrophobic dye that labels cell membranes and does not diffuse through gap junctions. Calcein AM is a colourless uncharged molecule that freely enters cells and is hydrolysed by endogenous esterases to generate calcein, the charged fluorescent form. Calcein cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane but is able to pass across gap junctions. Therefore, the transfer of calcein from cell to cell is a suitable indicator of gap junctional communication. First, BHK cells transfected with 2B replicon or control cells (transfection with C replicon) were double labelled and washed before being mixed with unlabelled cells (1:3). Non\u2010transfected co\u2010cultures established functional contacts as assessed by transfer of intracellular green fluorescent calcein to the cytoplasm of neighbouring DiI\u2010negative cells (Fig. 6A). Similarly, calcein transfer from 2B\u2010expressing cells to healthy cells was also observed at 8 hpe (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, we noted that the number of neighbouring cells which received calcein was comparable both in 2B and C protein co\u2010cultures, although it was slightly lower than that obtained for non\u2010transfected co\u2010cultures (Fig. 5B and C and data not shown). This difference could be accounted for by the shut off induced by the SV\u2010derived replicons (Sanz et al., 2007). To gain further insights into the significance of these results, connexion 43 (Cx 43) level was examined by immunoblotting in cells that express the viral products and in healthy cells. Cx 43 is widely expressed in different types of mammalian cells and assembles gap junction channels. Although Cx 43 expression in BHK cells has been previously reported, other investigators described them as communication\u2010deficient cells since they detected endogenous Cx 43 retained in the Golgi (Udawatte and Ripps, 2005). We found the expression of Cx 43 in BHK cells as well as two products which migrate above Cx 43, corresponding to phosphorylated forms of the protein (Asklund et al., 2003). Although the amount of Cx 43 was similar in both transfected and untransfected cells, a slight reduction in accumulated connexin was observed after synthesis of the viral proteins (Fig. 6D). In order to examine the subcellular localization of Cx 43 in BHK cells, an immunofluorescence assay was performed using specific antibodies. An intracellular Cx 43 staining pattern, probably resulting from the association of connexin with the Golgi complex, was observed, consistent with previous studies (Udawatte and Ripps, 2005). Unexpectedly, Cx 43 was also clearly observed at the plasma membrane. Moreover, punctate Cx 43 staining was concentrated at cell\u2013cell contact areas corresponding to bona fide gap junctions (Fig. 6E). It is important to mention that this localization pattern of Cx 43 was not altered after expression of SV C or PV 2B proteins at 8 hpe and, furthermore, Cx 43 was detected at contacts between transfected and healthy non\u2010transfected BHK cells (Fig. 6F). Nevertheless, a very low proportion of 2B\u2010expressing cells exhibited a reduced level of Cx 43\u2010associated fluorescence. This observation is consistent with the slight reduction reported above. Taken together, these findings support the notion that gap junctions assembled by Cx 43 are functional both in healthy and in 2B\u2010expressing BHK cells and could mediate the transfer of HB from permeabilized 2B\u2010expressing cells to neighbouring cells, as occurs with the calcein dye\u2010coupling assay.",

To date, the permeabilizing activity of PV 2B protein to small molecules and ions had only been described to occur cell autonomously (de Jong et al., 2006; Madan et al., 2007). In this study, we have provided evidence that permeabilization of cells to the translation inhibitor HB by PV 2B viroporin promotes a bystander inhibition of protein synthesis in non\u2010transfected cells. This is the first report of a bystander permeabilization effect triggered by a viroporin. Permeabilization assays carried out using co\u2010cultures of 2B\u2010expressing cells with non\u2010transfected cells revealed that the entry of HB takes place efficiently in both healthy and transfected BHK cells at early time points after transfection, when the 2B permeabilizing activity is maximal. Moreover, the observation of a reduced bystander effect at later time points, when most 2B\u2010expressing cells exhibit clear signs of apoptosis, suggests that this phenomenon is primarily triggered by the synthesis of 2B protein.",

Our present findings indicate that MHV E and SV 6K proteins also induce the entry of HB into surrounding non\u2010transfected cells. However, the extent of this effect depended on the viroporin tested and its permeabilization kinetics. The coronavirus E protein induced a rapid and powerful permeabilization of the plasma membrane soon after its synthesis, as observed in cells expressing 2B (Madan et al., 2005; 2008). The bystander effect in co\u2010cultures expressing E was also comparable to that promoted by PV 2B. In contrast, SV 6K protein requires longer times of expression to efficiently permeabilize cells. Although 6K\u2010expressing cells were entirely permeabilized at 16 hpe in this case, the entry of HB in healthy neighbouring cells was only moderate. As a consequence of the slow permeabilization kinetics of 6K, the shut\u2010off induced by the SV replicon for a longer period of time might have interfered with the function of other essential cellular factors required for the permeabilization of healthy cells. The expression of NS4A caused cytotoxicity in BHK cells but did not permeabilize them efficiently. Therefore, protein synthesis of non\u2010transfected cells remained unaltered. Previously, we reported that the viroporins included in this work induce caspase\u2010dependent apoptosis (Madan et al., 2008). However, since permeabilization already occurs soon after transfection, when no signs of cell death are apparent, it is unlikely that permeabilization of healthy cells to HB occurs as a result of cytotoxicity arising from the presence of apoptotic transfected cells. Moreover, in the case of NS4A, apoptosis can be detected in transfected cells at early time points after its expression but no bystander permeabilization was found (data not shown) (Madan et al., 2008).",

Possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon include endocytosis of toxic cell debris arising from viroporin\u2010expressing cells, exposure to secreted soluble viroporins or cell\u2013cell transfer of HB (through gap junctions). We can rule out the two first possibilities, as healthy cells incubated for different periods of time with the medium obtained from cultures of 2B\u2010expressing cells were not permeabilized (data not shown). Furthermore, no 2B protein was found in the protein precipitate from the extracellular medium (Fig. 5C). The E protein from MHV\u2010A59 is released in vesicles from transfected cells to the extracellular medium (Maeda et al., 1999). Here, we have shown that E protein is able to induce a bystander permeabilization to HB in neighbouring cells similar to that exerted by 2B, but only the E protein is detected in the culture medium of transfected cells (2, 5). Further studies will be needed to define a possible role of extracellular E viroporin in mediating the bystander effect in neighbouring non\u2010transfected cells.",

The observation that entry of HB into neighbouring cells is directly proportional to the cell density and requires contact between healthy and 2B\u2010expressing cells supports a requirement for additional cellular factors besides 2B synthesis for the bystander effect to occur (Fig. 5A and B). Our findings strongly support a role for gap junctions in the bystander permeabilization effect. Gap junctions mediate communication by means of cell coupling between neighbouring cells, allowing ions and water\u2010soluble substances to pass from one cell to another (Kumar and Gilula, 1996; Rose and Ransom, 1997). Gap junctional intercellular communication mediates a bystander effect and it is a natural amplifier of the therapeutic effect in herpes simplex virus\u2010thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV\u2010tk/GCV) gene therapy (Dilber et al., 1997; Asklund et al., 2003). Gap junctional intercellular communication is often downregulated in cancer cells (Yamasaki, 1990; Zhang et al., 2007). Consistent with these observations, the bystander permeabilization to HB in two tumour cell lines, Huh\u20107 and HeLa cells, that were co\u2010cultured with BHK or Huh\u20107 cells expressing 2B protein, was significantly reduced in comparison with that reported for co\u2010cultures of transfected and healthy BHK cells. This observation is consistent with a recent study implicating Cx 43 in the reduction of gap junctional intercellular communication in Huh\u20107 cells via downregulation of Cx 32 expression (Zhang et al., 2007). We have confirmed the presence of Cx 43 protein in non\u2010transfected and 2B\u2010expressing BHK cells and its distribution at the plasma membrane in areas of contact between adjacent cells (Fig. 6D\u2013F). Cx 43 was also detected in Huh\u20107 cells, although as a consequence of transfection of replicons encoding either C or C+2B protein, its amount was even more reduced than that observed in non\u2010transfected cells (Fig. S6). In our experiments, we still detected a bystander effect when co\u2010cultures include a high proportion of 2B\u2010expressing Huh\u20107 cells. Moreover, we confirmed the functional status of gap junction channels in BHK cells with the ability to establish new cell\u2013cell contacts and to mediate fluorescent dye transfer between healthy and 2B\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 6A\u2013C).",

This finding supports the hypothesis that the bystander phenomenon involves cell\u2013cell transfer of HB via gap junctions (Fig. 7). We propose a model in which HB first enters 2B\u2010permeable cells passing through viral (a) or cellular pores at the plasma membrane (b) or via an as yet undefined pathway (c). Once inside cells, HB inhibits translation in 2B\u2010expressing cells and is simultaneously transferred to neighbouring cells through gap junctions (Fig. 8), leading to inhibition of protein synthesis in those healthy cells. Thus, the effect of HB on neighbouring cells would depend on the gap junctional intercellular communication and the proportion of cells that express 2B protein, which would act as the trigger for the bystander effect. In addition, the present findings suggest that cytotoxic drugs, having membrane permeability properties similar to HB, can enter viroporin\u2010expressing cells and subsequently may kill adjacent tumour cells.",
