In Malaysia, underground economy has been growing and is reported to be worth approximately USD3.1 billion (The Star Online 2010c ) . Cases of victims losing their hard earned savings and retirement funds through unscrupulous ideas such as the Ponzi scheme, pyramid selling schemes or remittance scams have too often been heard. 3 Situations are made worse when there is an economic crisis. Nothing could be more palpable than the extent of anxiety caused by the 2008 global economic crisis. Not only did it intensify income insecurity due to pay cuts and layoffs but it also presented long term effects owing to the erosion of savings, the disruption of social safety nets and the rise in food prices. 4 Food insecurity is further exacerbated by environmental disasters brought about by climate change. This will have a direct impact on the poor and the vulnerable. It is without doubt that economic crises can transmit between economically integrated countries and \"wipe out years of poverty reduction\" efforts (FAO 2009 ) . The Asia Pacifi c still remains the highest undernourished region compared to Latin America and Africa, with a steady rise in number of people from over 500 million in 1995 to 642 million in 2009 642 million in (FAO 2009 .

In 1982, The Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues, in support of the CSCE, called for the development of a common security to overcome the unrealistic build up of armaments in international politics based on the balance of power principle. Partly seen as a critique of realism it warned that stability anchored in an arms race is too fragile and \"a more effective way to ensure security is to create positive processes that can lead to peace and disarmament\" (1982: 7). The report of the Commission provided the impetus to expand the narrow understanding of traditional military threats by highlighting developmental issues pertaining to the Third World.",

Apart from preserving the military dimension, the framework also emphasized economic security. The importance placed on the latter can be explained by the 'hostility' that Japan was experiencing in its rise to become an economic power and the changing security environment compelling Japan to play a more proactive role than to remain fully dependent on the United States. 6 Leveraging on its economic strength, Japan sought a framework that would allow it to justify its role in contributing to international peace through the use of its offi cial development assistance (ODA) program and in safeguarding stable supplies of food and energy resources (Akaha 1991 ) .",

Even then, it has not resolved the many confl icts that continue to occur within states and among societies such as the South Thailand confl ict, the Rohingyas issue and the Xinjiang unrest. The problem lies in the delineation of territories either fought through wars or colonialism that failed to properly capture the composition of various ethnic groups. In short, the arrangement of the international system was based primarily on states rather than on societies. In many instances, societies were required to organize themselves within the boundaries that had been predetermined and pledge allegiance to their respective states even if they found it diffi cult to accept. Cases that have led to unfortunate bloodshed such as in the Balkans clearly showed what happens when there is a grave mismatch between nation building and societal make-up.

The former focuses on the \"\u2026safety from such chronic threats as hunger, disease and repression\" that refl ects a slow and silent process and the latter on the \"\u2026protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in the patterns of daily life\" that refl ect \"an abrupt, loud emergency\" (UNDP 1994 : 23-24) .

Together with Norway, a Human Security Partnership was established in May 1998 to address landmine and child soldier issues, among others. A year later, Canada led a group of like-minded countries, who gathered in Lys\u00f8en, Norway, to push for the concept as a policy agenda, defi ning it as \"freedom from pervasive threats to people's rights, the safety or even their lives\". 9 Furthermore, that year saw the launching of human security under the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) that sought to integrate the concept into sustainable development strategies at the regional and local levels.",

            "text": "In 2000, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan strongly called for the building of a world \"free of want\" and \"free of fear\" at the Millennium Summit. In response, the Government of Japan initiated the establishment of the Commission on Human Security (CHS) in 2001, which lasted for 2 years. 10 Co-chaired by former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, the CHS took on the task of defi ning and developing the concept as an operational tool for policy implementation. Its 2003 report, Human Security Now , incorporates two approaches -bottom-up and top-down. The former \"concentrates on empowering people\" through development programs that \"can best attained in a community context\" while the latter puts the onus on the state to protect the people's well-being through sound \"rule of law and judicial institutions\" (Ogata 2006 : 2-3) . Despite some shortcomings, the combination of the two approaches is thought to provide the framework for human security. 11 The 2003 report demonstrated Japan's stance on human security, which differs from those pursued by Canada and Norway. For the latter two, human security ought to be defi ned in a narrower form based particularly on the 'freedom from fear' and should thus focus on the two areas of political and personal securities -protection from political oppression and physical violence. The remaining fi ve areas (economic, food, health, environmental, and community securities) are considered more suited to human development, which the two countries felt were already being pursued under various UN programs, and therefore a clear distinction should be made between human security and human development (Alkire 2003 ) . Instead of prioritizing one over the other, Japan, on the other hand, followed the 1994 UNDP report that saw a need to pursue human security in its broadest sense, arguing that access to food and clean water as well as freedom from diseases and natural disasters affects the survival of individuals and are therefore of equal importance. 12 Since 2003, there have been further efforts taken by the UN to move away from the fi xation on state security towards human security by drawing up a new security consensus that would legitimize international interventions in places that undermine human security (Alkire 2003 : 4) . Therein lies the diffi cult challenge of addressing the issue of humanitarian intervention due to the overarching principles of sovereignty and non-interference in domestic affairs. One of the earliest efforts to address this concern was the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, 10 To be certain, Japan had been advocating human security as a new strategy as early as 1995 through Prime Minister Murayama's speech to the UN (Acharya 2001 ) . 11 Muthien and Bunch argue that there are limitations in the CHS report for what they see as a failure to address women insecurities due to what they alleged to be a male-centered reporting (Schwartz 2004 ) . 12 Fukushima ( 2009 ) notes that there is now less focus on debating the concept of human security and more focus on operationalizing it. set up in 2000 and largely sponsored by Canada. In their 2001 report, the Commission sought to emphasize that sovereignty is not about \"control\" but about \"responsibility\". Sovereignty does not only mean respect for the territorial integrity of other states but the responsibility to respect and protect the dignity and safety of citizens. This dual meaning showed resoluteness to hold national authorities accountable for their actions within their geographical borders and signifi ed that the international community through the UN has a responsibility to act collectively should states fail to uphold their basic duties. The meaning of sovereignty and intervention is thus broadened to cover individuals -the core focus of human security. It also strengthened the notion of human rights as being universal.",

The fi rst pillar reinforces the 2005 endorsement that places the responsibility to protect civilians from harm squarely on the state. The message was clear -the UN opposes atrocities, unlawful killings and systematic attacks by states on their vulnerable populations.

For too long, ASEAN has been criticized for being an organization catering solely to the interest of its member states. This is perhaps best refl ected in former Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan's speech in 2002 when he said, In 1998, at the time the idea of fl exible engagement was proposed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial meeting, I proposed the creation of a \"caucus for social safety nets.\" None of my ASEAN colleagues supported me. Most of the support came from outside ASEAN, particularly the West-Australia, the United States, Russia, and even India. I proposed a caucus of social safety nets because all of a sudden millions of our people had slid back into poverty and they needed help to sustain them through the crisis. My colleagues thought the idea was another Western idea and another way of coming through the back door in order to interfere with the internal affairs of member states. So we should not underestimate the problems, the resistance, the doubt that could occur as we work to shift from the supremacy of the state to a focus on individuals (2002: 56; emphasis added).",

The author argues that the refugee issue highlights the ineffectiveness of the human security paradigm in transcending the deep-rooted traditional security agenda and views ethics and morality as indispensable in creating a sustainable security culture of reconciliation. Chapter 2 takes up the issue of health security, focusing on the vulnerability of women to HIV transmission in mainland China. Chinese women, due to the patriarchal nature of the society, will continue to suffer from the lack of empowerment and remain highly insecure unless a gendered response to HIV based on international best practices is appropriately enforced. Empowerment is undeniably the key to forestalling the spread of communicable diseases. Chapter 3 looks at the historical trend of population policy in Vietnam and its relations to human security. In discussing Vietnam's demographic changes, the author shows that the level of transition from state to human security approaches in the four important areas of migration, reproductive rights, food supply and the environment, and minority rights has remained unclear due to various internal and external developments.",

Employing both top-down and bottom-up approaches, the author examines the concept of human security as viewed by the government and by the people and reveals that while the state concerns itself with the protection of its citizens working abroad, it fails to provide protection for the migrants' families at home from insecurities that are seen as the reason for migrants to emigrate in the fi rst place.",

Chapter 7 takes issue with the environment as well but fi xes squarely on the inability of ASEAN to mitigate the ill effects of climate change due to its outdated diplomatic culture.

Providing a number of case studies as support and seeing multi-sectoral cooperation as compulsory to sustainable solution, the author argues that health security is crucial. The failure of governments to protect their citizens risks exposing them to extremism and threatens the security of states. It clearly illustrates and strengthens the point that human security is not inferior to traditional security as conventionally thought.",

            "text": "Chapter 10 assesses the extent of economic security being considered in the process of proliferating free trade agreements (FTAs). Engaged in competition to outdo each other in the number of FTAs signed, governments have largely centered attention on national economic interests rather than giving suffi cient consideration to long-term effects and structural transformations that could negatively impact peoples' economic wellbeing. Turning to political security, Chap. 11 discusses one of the major issues on the international human rights agenda -the death penalty. Despite democratic progress, the death penalty continues to exist in most parts of East Asia. Contrasting the experiences of South Korea and Japan, the author shows that the former has achieved great progress in abolishing capital punishment because of reform-minded leaders' ability to generate change regardless of public opinion while the latter has been incapacitated by its own enjoyment of political stability to take bold and unfavorable initiatives to enact reforms. Lastly, Chap. 12 sets the course for an examination into the principle of sovereignty and the legal-political and ecological impacts of sea level change affecting small island states (SISs). Sovereignty as traditionally defi ned, argues the author, is a hindrance to resolving environmental threats to SISs. Legal and political consensus among the international community is a necessity to address and prevent human misery due to the perils of inundation.",
