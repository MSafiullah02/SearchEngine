After cloning into an expression vector, the immunoglobulins are displayed on the coat of a bacteriophage. These immunoglobulins can then be specifically amplified, and the antigen against which they are directed can subsequently be identified. Gilden has already achieved success using this approach for at least one chronic infection caused by measles virus (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis; SSPE). His laboratory is now directing its attention to the MS lesions and the CNS areas where the CSF is produced.",

Subramamiam Sriram (Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) presented data indicating that the CSF of 97% of MS patients (compared with 18% of patients with other neurological diseases) contains genomic material from the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae, as shown by PCR amplification. Sriram was also able to culture C. pneumoniae from the CSF of MS patients. Furthermore, oligoclonal bands from MS CSF were adsorbed by incubation of the fluid with a C. pneumoniae antigen, but not with antigens from herpes simplex or measles viruses. These data support his view that the immune response in those patients was directed against C. pneumoniae. Sriram also suggested that a therapeutic trial with antibiotics directed against C. pneumoniae might be required to demonstrate a causal association between this microorganism and MS.",

            "text": "Konstance Knox (Institute for Viral Pathogenesis, Milwaukee, WI, USA) presented equally compelling data supporting earlier suggestions3 that human herpesvirus six (HHV-6) is associated with MS. Immunohistochemical analysis of MS plaques has revealed a concentration of an HHV-6 antigen in oligodendrocytes, the CNS cells responsible for the formation and maintenance of myelin (myelin destruction is a key component of the MS lesion). Knox and collaborators found HHV-6 expression in 17 out of 19 patients with \u2018active\u2019 disease, compared with only three out of 23 patients with \u2018inactive\u2019 MS. There were also dramatic differences in viremia. Twenty seven out of 41 patients with MS had active HHV-6 viremia, compared with none of the 61 controls. Other investigators presented data supporting potential roles for human endogenous retroviruses (Herve Perron, Biomerieux SA, Lyon, France), and delayed exposure to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Tove Christensen and Sven Haar, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark) as potential triggers4, 5. However, as with many such reports, in most individuals there is evidence of prior or current infection with these agents whether or not they have MS, and there are no more-definitive tests such as viremia or analysis of oligoclonal bands to differentiate patients with MS from those with other diseases. Further research will be needed in order to clarify and reconcile these potentially conflicting findings, as several presentations outlined an association with a specific agent in over half of the cases.",

            "text": "It is entirely possible that multiple microorganisms are each responsible for a small proportion of this disease, perhaps indirectly, by inducing immune responses that result in an immune attack on the CNS, without persisting in the affected patient. Several animal models of virally induced demyelination, particularly those associated with murine coronaviruses or with Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), support such an idea. In these models, demyelination is related to the presence of an identified virus within the CNS; in TMEV-mediated disease, the extent of demyelination depends not only on viral load but also on a locus on mouse chromosome 11 (Michel Brahic, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Although an intact immune system is necessary for the disease to manifest in its full form, which arm of the immune response is most critical varies from model to model, and even within models, apparently depending on the viral strain. Demyelination after TMEV infection of mice transgenic for a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was shown to be modulated by the HLA transgene (Moses Rodriguez, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA), a finding that might relate to the preponderance of certain HLA subtypes in MS. Interestingly, by careful injection, foreign antigens can be introduced into the brain of mice and not be \u2018seen\u2019 by the immune system until after a subsequent peripheral challenge, which leads to detection and commencement of an immunopathological process (Hugh Perry, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK).",

            "text": "Whether or not a single agent is indeed responsible for this disease, there are multiple ways in which an infectious agent could be associated with, or trigger, MS. In some of these, the microorganism might no longer be present by the time the disease manifests but, for example, it affects the CNS by changing the intrathecal cytokine environment and promoting pro-inflammatory reactions or by stimulating autoreactive T cells. Matthias Von Herrath (Scripps Clinic, San Diego, CA, USA) indicated that, in an autoimmune diabetes model, the growth kinetics of different strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus determined whether the disease was exacerbated by a second peripheral challenge or whether this was, in fact, protective. Balances between immune reactions also produce different responses in Borna virus infection in rats (Luther Stitz, Institute of Animal Health, T\u00fcebingen, Germany). One of the more popular arguments has been that a microorganism could stimulate an autoimmune response by mimicking an endogenous antigen (antigenic mimicry) (Uwe Liebert, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Henry McFarland, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA); circumstantial evidence indicates that such a mechanism could lead to the development of autoimmune, reactive T-cell clones6, 7. Alternatively, an exogenous agent could act as an adjuvant, perhaps by incorporating a self-antigen into its structure, much like retroviruses can incorporate cellular proteins into their envelopes8. Steve Miller (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL, USA) presented data to indicate that only antigen-presenting cells from TMEV- infected mice with pre-existing myelin damage and not from acutely infected or control mice were able to present proteolipid apoprotein (PLP) epitopes to specific T-helper type 1 cell lines.",
