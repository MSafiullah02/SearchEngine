            "text": "Empowered by the ubiquitous access to computer devices and the Internet, an ever-growing amount of digital images has been emerged [25]. In light of this, image retrieval is considered as an active research topic that aims at retrieving relevant images to a user query from a large database of digital images [11, 14, 21, 26]. Until recently, most of the popular search engines (e.g., Flickr) are built upon the textual information associated with images [4, 7, 24]. Nevertheless, they cannot comprehensively describe the rich content of images since they totally ignore the visual information [10]. Besides, they suffer from the fact that the textual information is often noisy, ambiguous and language-dependent [8, 12]. As a consequence, the retrieved results may be noisy and irrelevant which may affect the retrieval performance [17, 24]. To tackle those issues, visual re-ranking has been introduced to refine the text-based retrieval results using the visual information [4, 19, 32, 35]. Namely, it attempts to boost the rank of relevant images with respect to the textual query [24]. Recently, the hypergraph learning has been widely used in many applications for its capability in capturing complex relationships among samples [4, 15, 23]. In case of visual re-ranking, the textual results are taken as vertices and the re-ranking problem is formulated as a transductive learning on the hypergraph [2, 9]. The potential of the hypergraph learning is essentially determined by the hypergraph construction scheme [22]. Most of previous hypergraph learning methods adopt a neighborhood-based strategy to build the hypergraph, in which textual results are taken as vertices and each vertex is linked to its k nearest neighbors by an hyperedge. While obvious, this method suffers from the following drawbacks: (1) it is sensitive to noise (2) lacks the ability to discover the real neighborhood structure (3) the parameter k is fixed as global parameter for all samples regardless their local data distribution. To tackle those issues, recent works have proposed to leverage the regularized regression models, namely the sparse representation and the ridge regression for hypergraph construction [22]. Compared to the neighborhood-based hypergraph, the sparse hypergraph achieves superior performance in revealing the local data structure and handling the noisy data. However, it cannot discover related samples to one hyperedge centroid as thoroughly as possible. Moreover, the sparse constraint makes the hypergraph construction very expensive [41]. Recently, the ridge regression has gained considerable attention not only for its effectiveness in data representation but also for its computational efficiency [41]. In contrast to sparse representation which aims at encouraging the competition between samples to represent a datum, the ridge regression attempt to include all samples in the representation process. That\u2019s why this framework is often called the collaborative representation. Owing to these desirable properties, in this paper, we put a particular emphasis on the collaborative representation and we propose an adaptive collaborative hypergraph learning for visual re-ranking. The proposed data representation technique adaptively preserve the locality structure and discard irrelevant/outlier samples with respect to a test sample by integrating a distance-regularizer on the representation coefficients. At the feature level, we impose a weight matrix on the representation errors to adaptively highlight the important features and reduce the effect of redundant/noisy ones. Moreover, to enhance the representation interpretability, a nonnegativity constraint is added in such a way that the representation coefficients can directly reveal the similarity among samples. This way, we obtain a more informative and quality hypergraph which not only captures the grouping information but also reveal the local neighborhood structure and exhibit more discriminative power and robustness to noisy data. Extensive experiments on the public MediaEval benchmarks demonstrate that our re-ranking method achieves consistently superior results, compared to state of-the-art methods.",

            "text": "In recent years, many visual re-ranking methods have been proposed in the literature. According to the statistical analysis model used, they could be classified as supervised and unsupervised methods. The former cast the re-ranking to a classification problem that aims at separating relevant from irrelevant images using data from the initial results as training samples. For instance, authors in [30] built a supervised classification model using expert annotations to assign a relevance score to each image. The latter assumes that relevant samples are probably to be close to each other than to irrelevant ones. It aims at discovering and mining patterns using pair-wise similarities. Clearly, there are two paramount ways. The first is to leverage clustering to group images with respect to their visual closeness. For instance, a Hierarchical Clustering is applied in [1] and [29] to cluster samples by relevance. Authors in [28] apply a graph-based clustering method where a similarity graph is initially built to represent relationships among images. The second way is to adopt the graph-based learning for its effectiveness in modeling the intrinsic structure within data. VisualRank proposed by Jing and Baluja [20] is the most popular graph-based re-ranking method. It applies a random walk on an affinity graph where images are taken as nodes and their visual similarities as probabilistic hyper-links. In [39], a manifold ranking process is applied over the data manifold, with the aim of naturally finding the most relevant images. Although promising results are achieved, how to represent complex and high-order relationships hidden in data still the performance bottleneck for graph-based re-ranking. As a generalization of the graph learning, the hypergraph learning is receiving increasing attention in recent years owing to its ability in modeling complex data structure in a more flexible and elegant way [3, 23]. Considering the visual re-ranking, the hypergraph learning is widely used for relevance estimation. For instance, in [2], authors construct a k-nearest neighbor graphs based on the visual similarity between images. Then, a hypergraph ranking is performed to learn the images\u2019 relevance scores. Although efficient, this method suffers from some drawbacks. First, the neighborhood strategy cannot capture the local data distribution of each datum since it uses a fixed number of neighbors k for all samples [35]. Second, the neighborhood strategy is very sensitive to noisy data due to the use of the Euclidean distance as similarity measure [22, 37]. To address those limitations, some researchers have proposed to exploit the regression models for data representation. The most widely used model is the sparse representation (SR) in which each sample is represented as a linear combination of the remaining samples [15, 36]. Compared to the neighborhood-based hypergraph, the sparse hypergraph achieves superior performance in revealing the local data structure and handling the noisy data. However, it cannot discover related samples to one hyperedge centroid as thoroughly as possible. Moreover, the sparse constraint makes the hypergraph construction very expensive. Recently, the collaborative representation has gained considerable attention not only for its effectiveness in data representation but also for its computational efficiency [41]. Therefore, in this paper, we put a particular emphasis on the collaborative representation and we propose an adaptive collaborative hypergraph learning for visual re-ranking.",

Many references have pointed out that redundant/noisy features are likely to have large reconstruction errors [23, 40]. Based on this assumption, we regularize the reconstruction errors by a nonnegative weight matrix W. Hence, we adaptively highlight the important features while reducing the effect of redundant/noisy ones.The \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\ell _2-$$\\end{document}regularizer on the weight matrix: This term as well as the constraint \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$W^T\\mathbf 1 =\\mathbf 1 $$\\end{document} are imposed to avoid the trivial solution of W as in [42].The regularization term on the representation matrix: It shrinks the representation coefficients towards zero by imposing an \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\ell _2-$$\\end{document}-regularizer on their sizes. Indeed, all samples will collaborate during the representation process of a test sample since their coefficients will never become exactly zero.The locality-preserving term: The collaborative representation does not consider the data locality which has been observed to be critical for many learning tasks [34]. For this purpose, we incorporate a locality-preserving term in our model so that (1) the local structure is preserved (i.e, close samples will have close representation) and (2) irrelevant/outliers samples are discarded. Mathematically, each element of the distance matrix D is defined as: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$d_ {ij}=\\left| | x_i-x_j \\right| |_{2}^{2}$$\\end{document}.Finally, we add the following constraints on the representation matrix Z:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Z\\ge 0$$\\end{document}: A non-negative representation coefficient \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$z_{ij}$$\\end{document} can directly reveal the similarity between the samples \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$x_i$$\\end{document} and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$x_j$$\\end{document} [45].\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$diag(Z)=0$$\\end{document}: this constraint is used to avoid that a sample is represented as a linear combination of itself.Z1 = 1: the sum of each row of Z is set to be equal to 1 which ensure that all samples are selected in the joint representation.\nThe ADMM-Based Optimization.

On the General-70 database, which is a complex and general-purpose multi-concept database, we achieve a \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$P@20=0.7921$$\\end{document} compared to \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$P@20=0.5437$$\\end{document} achieved by the best team (LAPI) [6]. Our method, which not only models the complex and high-order relationships among visual samples via hypergraph but also capture the overall contextual information by the means of collaborative representation, achieves the best performance among the compared methods. This clearly demonstrates the validity of our method for visual re-ranking not only on for landmark image retrieval but also for multi-topic image retrieval.\n",

From the results, the following observations can be drawn:Despite their ability in refining the initial retrieval results, graph-based re-ranking methods are almost outperformed by the hypergraph-based ones. This demonstrates that, in contrast to graph model, hypergraph model has and inherent ability to capture the local group information and latent high-order relationships among samples.The experimental results reveal also the good robustness and discriminative power of representation based hypergraph learning compared to neighborhood based hypergraph learning. On different databases, the representation based hypergraph ranking achieves the highest precision compared to hypergraph ranking based on neighborhood relationships. In particular, our method consistently and significantly achieves the best relevance improvement among other representation based hypergraph ranking.The adaptive collaborative representation has bring more robustness and discriminative power to the hypergraph than the collaborative representation.

We find that our method outperforms Flickr for almost all query topics. The experimental results also reveal that, the relevance of retrieval results is higher for landmarks queries compared to complex queries. One explanation is that, non -relevant images were likely to be arisen when the query is ambiguous or involve multiple topics. For example, the query \u2018baby in stroller\u2019 may give rise to images that contain an empty stroller. Another interesting observations, is that the retrieval performance is degraded for some queries (e.g. \u2018baby in stroller\u2019). This can be attributed to the fact that a high relevance score for a non-relevant image will be propagated to its visually similar neighbors since only the visual information is used for building the hypergraph.\n",

At the core of our method is the data representation. Particularly, we proposed a novel representation technique called adaptive collaborative representation to build a more informative hypergraph. By constraining the self-representation term with an weighted matrix, the effect of those redundant and useless features can be adaptively minimized so that a more robust hypergraph can be constructed. In addition, our data representation technique has the advantage of simultaneously capturing both global and local structures of data during hypergraph learning by introducing a locality-preserving term. Based on the obtained representation matrix, we showed how to generate consistent hyperedge connections and hyperedge weights. Finally, a transductive learning is successfully performed upon the constructed hypergraph to learn the images\u2019 relevance scores. Experimental results performed on public MediaEval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistently superior results compared to state-of-the art re-ranking methods.",
