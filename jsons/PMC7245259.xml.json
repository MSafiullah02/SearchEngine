The pathogen, named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO)[1], is responsible for a novel pneumonia affecting the lower respiratory tract, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 represents a global pandemic, affecting 212 countries and territories around the world, with over 3.200.000 infected subjects and more than 228.000 deaths[2]. The exponential afflux of patients in need of sub-intensive or intensive care represents, for most of the healthcare systems around the globe, a crisis of unprecedented magnitude in the post-world war era. While the population continues to be affected by the whole spectrum of pre-existing diseases, hospitals were swamped with a massive number of COVID-19 patients to the point that prompted the Administrations to create COVID-19 dedicated wards, ICUs and hospitals with redistribution of healthcare workers (HCW) from non-COVID-19 to COVID-19 intensive and sub-intensive units. In this context, majority of surgical departments were forced, both due to reduced manpower/facilities and to limit the viral spread, to re-schedule their activity giving priority to urgent/emergent and non-deferrable oncological cases. The prioritization of patients is a complex strategy that poses several organizational and ethical issues.",

Moreover, a Google search of the topic related key words was also conducted along with national and international Surgical Societies and Health Institutions websites. References of the included papers were checked to identify any additional study and the related articles function was used. After eliminating double hits, two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility. For potentially relevant records, the full-text guidelines were obtained, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Articles and guidelines in English language, reporting practical indications on operative and perioperative management during pandemics were included. Given the lack of high-quality evidence on the COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of the pandemic, we included guidelines irrespective of their methodological level and their development process. In fact, most of decision-making and guideline development on this topic are based on the limited available data and information inferred from other viruses and similar epidemics. Moreover, expert opinions and author\u2019s experiences in endemic areas were considered. Editorial, commentaries, duplicated and non-English articles were excluded. We analyzed statements and recommendations regarding elective/oncologic/emergency surgery, laparoscopy, and operations in COVID-19 positive patients.",

While in phase I (few COVID-19 cases), elective surgery is still performed but restricted to patients with survivorship possibly compromised if not operated within 3 months, in phase II and III only urgent/emergent operations are performed. Ross et al.[23] distinguishes four different pandemic phases according to the number of COVID-19 cases and Hospital/ICU capacity. In the alert phase (no COVID-19) elective surgery is performed as usual; with COVID-19 cases skyrocketing, reduction by 50% should be started and eventually totally suspended performing only urgent/emergent cases.",

The NHS guidelines [5] suggest to classify patients requiring surgery according to four levels of surgical priority (Table 2\n). Operations are distinguished in emergent (<24 hours), urgent (<72 hours) and elective (deferrable for up to 4 weeks, 3 months and beyond 3 months), providing a detailed list of surgical procedures for each category[5]. During the pandemic, surgery that can be deferred for up to 4 weeks might still be performed, balancing the risk between the underlying condition and the viral spread. This category includes some cancer operations and surgery for complicated benign conditions unresponsive to medical therapy. ACS [26] identifies different tiers of surgical procedures according to acuity of surgery (high, intermediate and low according to Elective Surgery Acuity Scale) and patient\u2019s general condition. High acuity surgery (most cancers and highly symptomatic patients) should not be delayed during the pandemic. ESMO [11] identifies three levels of priority (high, medium and low), defined by incorporating the evaluation of the patient\u2019s overall clinical condition and the expected benefit provided by the intervention in terms of survival and quality of life.",

This measure increases the resources for COVID-19 patients, clearing ward and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Moreover, it avoids unnecessary patient traffic in the hospital and reduces the risk of cross-infection between elective patients, hospital visitors and COVID-19 patients, preventing spread of infection from the hospital to the community[19,27]. If on one hand, postponing elective procedures is necessary, on the other, every delay in treatment, may lead to adverse outcomes. Clinicians should assess the risk of proceeding and delaying surgery considering that a possible time of 6-7 weeks could be necessary to see a decrease in COVID-19 prevalence[26]. As suggested by all Authors, a clear surgical strategy and a plan for providing essential operations during the pandemic should be developed, in order to keep the system effective. Due to a rapidly changing environment, keeping the Triage criteria in mind, all surgical systems will need to constantly adapt to the continuously evolving situation. In particular, surgical planning must take local resources constraints into account as a means to understand the potential impact of each decision[28].",

            "text": "In newly evaluated invasive cancers, the tumor board may decide, case by case, whether to proceed with upfront surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT), depending also on institutional resources[29]. Alternative approaches to be considered are hormonal therapy for some ER-positive invasive cancers and NAT for triple negative-HER2 positive tumors[25]. Primary surgery is deemed non-deferrable when the patient cannot undergo chemotherapy or when pathological examination of small tumors can guide medical treatment[29]. ACS encourages the use of breast conserving strategies whenever possible, reserving definitive mastectomy only for patients whose survivorship is likely to be compromised if not operated within 3 months (provided that radiation oncology services are available)[25]. For clinically low-risk primary breast cancers, clinicians may consider starting neoadjuvant/preoperative endocrine therapy according to menopausal status and delaying surgery[29]. Inflammatory and locally advanced breast cancers should receive NAT prior to surgery[25]. High priority should be given to patients who have completed NAT and to those progressing on NAT[12,25,29]. Other indications to non-deferrable surgery are: breast cancer in pregnancy [29], excision of malignant recurrence (depending on phenotype and extent)[25,29], and discordant biopsies likely to be malignant[25,29]. In situation where hospital resources are all directed to COVID-19 patients, surgery should be limited to urgent/emergent situations such as breast abscesses, evacuation of hematomas, revision of an ischemic flap[25,29]. The following scenarios can be safely postponed for the duration of the pandemic: benign lesions and duct excision, discordant biopsies likely to be benign, non-invasive breast cancer (in situ) except for extended high-grade DCIS, breast reconstruction, prophylactic surgery[25,29]. Consider adjuvant hormone/chemotherapy and radiation for minimal margin involvement, delaying margin re-resection. Same principles should be followed in breast cancers candidates to additional axillary surgery[25].",

According to the Italian National Institute of Health, out of 1738 verified COVID-19 related deaths occurred in Italy up to April 16th, 16.2% had a history of active cancer in the last 5 years[34]. A nationwide analysis from China reported 18 out of 1590 COVID-19 cases with a history of cancer (1%; 95% CI 0.61-1.65)[35]. Cancer patients were reported to have a higher risk of severe clinical events, requiring invasive ventilation or leading to death, when compared with patients without cancer (HR 3.56 [95%CI, 1.65 to 7.69]). Clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, taking into account limitation of healthcare resources that need to be allocated properly[36,37]. All Authors agree that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration that alternative therapeutic approaches should be pursued, especially in very early- or very advanced-stage diseases as tumor biology and probability of cure should always be balanced. Turaga et al.[38] conducted a comprehensive study involving almost 4 million cancer patients who underwent definitive cancer and examined the estimated effect for each 1-week delay in definitive surgery from diagnosis. They found that most cancer surgeries can be safely delayed beyond the current waiting time for at least 4 weeks without having a significant impact on patient survival or cancer progression[38].",

A constant communication should be present regarding regional distribution of patients, ICU capacity, ventilators allocation[14,15]. Status of blood stocks should be regularly checked[15]. In case of reduced availability of red blood concentrates (RBC), plasma-first approach using an inverse ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to blood (2 FFP to 1 RBC) can be adopted[14]. Anyhow, the consultant in transfusion medicine has to be involved in decision-making as early as possible[14]. Evaluation of trauma patients should not be delayed to determine COVID-19 status, but rigorous use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for all patients[14].",

Conservative management for adhesive small bowel obstruction can be attempted as usual practice[39]. Note that naso-gastric tube placement may be an aerosol-generating procedure and appropriate precautions are recommended[6]. For large bowel perforation, open approach is preferable. In complicated diverticulitis, conservative approach should be maximized: IV antibiotics and percutaneous drainage for Hinchey class 1 and 2[24,39]. Surgery should be restricted to purulent or fecal peritonitis[39]. Hartmann procedure should be preferred over an anastomosis[24]. Colorectal anastomosis should be avoided in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, due to high risk of complications and subsequent consumption of healthcare resources[24]. Non-complicated appendicitis can be treated with non-operative management[24,39]. However, sparing of operating room (OR) resources should balance with the potential longer length of stay of conservative management[39]. In case of failure, surgical intervention should be promptly performed[39]. Appendicular abscess should be managed by percutaneous drainage if technically feasible[39]. Finally, perforated appendicitis requiring urgent surgery should be performed using an open approach in proven COVID-19 patients. Laparoscopy can be considered if adequate devices are available[24]. Regarding proctologic emergencies, any attempt should be made to manage the condition conservatively, especially in known or suspected COVID-19 positive[24]. Alternatively, management under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting should be preferred[39]. Emergency surgery should be restricted to bleeding and severe disease, or failure of conservative approach[24,39].",

According to the Intercollegiate General Surgery Guidance [6] and ISDE guidelines [13], laparoscopy should be performed only in selected cases, when clinical benefit evidently outweighs the risk of viral transmission. Di Saverio et al.[24] suggests that laparoscopy should be carefully considered in COVID-19 confirmed patients and only when appropriate equipment and full PPE are available and properly installed in OR. Cohen et al.[18] restricts minimally invasive surgery in COVID-19 negative patients and caution is recommended in patients with unknown COVID-19 status.

Aerosolization of blood born viruses has been previously detected in surgical smoke during laparoscopy[43,44]. Therefore, a potential risk of aerosol exposure must be considered also for SARS-CoV-2 even though there isn\u2019t current demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in the surgical smoke[16]. On the other hand, proven benefits of laparoscopy should be considered during COVID-19 pandemic, such as reduced length of stay and complications (and a potential minor burden on healthcare system). Moreover, at the present, there is very little evidence about the relative risks of laparoscopy versus open surgery, specific to COVID-19[7]. While laparoscopy has the potential for ultrafiltration of the majority if not all aerosolized particles, open surgery has a similar potential to generate aerosols without the possibility of safely containing the surgical smoke[7,17,45]. From the Literature review, we can conclude that a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation considering surgeon expertise, patient- and disease-related factors provided that appropriate PPE and OR equipment are available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.",

In accordance with the WHO and the CDC [1,46], aerosol generating procedures (tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, manual ventilation, bronchoscopy) should be performed in negative pressure ante-rooms, subsequently transferring the patient to the OR. Since such logistical resources are rarely available in the surgical departments, several authors prompt the use of the OR for patients\u2019 induction and recovery, in order to overcome this issue[6,13,19,20,22,24]. Similarly, while negative pressure ORs are considered ideal to minimize the infection risk [21,46], given their greater availability the use of positive pressure ORs is widely accepted for the for the treatment of COVID-19 cases [7,9,19,20,22,24], provided that an adequate air exchange rate is utilized[20,22]. From our review of the literature we can conclude that the viral spread through aerosol generating procedures and direct/indirect contact can be efficiently reduced by a rational use of the available spaces, even in absence of more advanced containment structures.",

HCWs and institutions must prepare for a substantial demand of surgical care, for all those patients who could not be treated during the pandemic. ACS provided a Join Statement together with ASA, EORN, AHA with general principles to guide resumption of elective surgery[48]. A substantial reduction of new COVID-19 cases for at least 14 days is deemed necessary before the reopening. Institutions have to guarantee patients and staff safety through an appropriate COVID-19 testing policy and adequate provision of PPE. Facilities should implement social distancing policies for staff, patient and patient visitors following local and national recommendations. Prioritization of cases requires a collegial discussion between surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses and principles such as specialties prioritization (cancer, transplants, cardiac surgery) should be considered. Post-COVID-19 patients who require operation should be carefully evaluated: readiness for surgery require a multidisciplinary evaluation (surgeon and anesthesiology) and appropriate peri and postoperative policies have to be established.",
