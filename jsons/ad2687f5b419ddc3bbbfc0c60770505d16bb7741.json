The increasing use of long-term indwelling central catheters and cytotoxic chemotherapies has contributed to the emergence of Gram-positive bacteria as the leading cause of bacteremia in cancer patients. These organisms are also among the foremost causes of pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections, osteomyelitis, and central nervous system infections in cancer patients. Gram-positive organisms have a remarkable ability to develop resistance to many of the currently available antimicrobials, but the predilection to become antimicrobial resistant varies substantially for particular organisms and for individual antimicrobial agents. Therefore physicians treating cancer patients need to be familiar with the common clinical manifestations, complications, and treatment options for a wide variety of diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria.",

S. aureus has the ability to cause a broad array of serious diseases, whereas CNS are plainly less virulent pathogens [20, 21] .",

S. aureus is a leading cause of catheter-related bacteremia, prosthetic joint infections, and postsurgical infections [21] . Among patients with cancer, suppurative complications such as infective endocarditis, bacteremic pneumonia, and osteomyelitis often result from S. aureus bacteremia [32, 33] . Necrotizing pneumonia due to S. aureus in patients with malignancy usually occurs in mechanically-ventilated patients, but can affect healthy patients in the community especially following an antecedent influenza infection or in patients with long-term in-dwelling catheters ( Fig. 35. 3) [34, 35] . The rise of CA-MRSA has been especially concerning given that CA-MRSA isolates can cause devastating invasive infection such as necrotizing fasciitis and necrotizing pneumonia even in otherwise healthy hosts and more so in patients with cancer [36] . S. aureus is commonly isolated from cancer patients with pyomyositis, septic arthritis, and septic bursitis either as a result of contiguous infection or hematogenous seeding [32] . The diagnosis of S. aureus infection is relatively straightforward as the organism is hardy, grows well in the microbiology laboratory, and is easily identified. The isolation of S. aureus from a sterile site should almost always be taken as evidence of invasive disease with the exception that, on occasion, S. aureus may contaminate blood cultures [37] . In light of the propensity of S. aureus to colonize, the isolation of S. aureus from nonsterile samples such as an endotracheal aspirate does not, in and of itself, indicate an infectious process [38] . Serologic or antigen assays have not proven to be clinically helpful in the diagnosis of an S. aureus infection.",

Optimal treatment for invasive MRSA infections is an area of intense debate with the most experience having been accumulated with vancomycin [47] . Treatment of bacteremic MRSA infection with vancomycin is associated with a substantial failure rate -perhaps 15-20%, although overt vancomycin resistance is not responsible [48] . These failures have motivated a search for alternative anti-MRSA agents [49, 50] and, during the past decade, new drugs active against MRSA have been developed including quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, tigecycline, and daptomycin [49] [50] [51] [52] .

The main sites of GAS colonization in humans are the oropharynx and skin [101, 102] . GBS commonly colonizes the perineal area, whereas GCS and GGS can be isolated from the throat and skin [103, 104] . The vast majority of infections due to these organisms have a community onset [64] . Having a malignancy markedly increases the risk of invasive disease due to b-hemolytic streptococci compared to the general population [105, 106] . The risk of cellulitis due to b-hemolytic streptococci is even further increased in patients with cancer who have had disruption of lymphatic drainage by, for example, a lymph node dissection [107] . Limited systematic studies have suggested that GBS is the most common of the invasive b-hemolytic streptococci isolated from persons with cancer followed by GAS, GCS, and GGS [108, 109] . The development of invasive GAS disease, however, carries an especially poor prognosis with mortality rates of >50% [110] .",

Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis caused by b-hemolytic streptococci in which disease is restricted to the dermis. Lesions are raised above the level of the surrounding tissue, and there is a clear demarcation of involved from uninvolved tissue [112] . This infection tends to occur -and, importantlyto recur in areas of damaged lymphatic drainage, which explains the propensity for recurrent infection in the ipsilateral arm after breast resection and lymph node dissection. Among children, GAS along with GCS and GGS are the leading bacterial causes of pharyngitis which is usually uncomplicated, although invasive disease, such as peritonsillar abscess and cervical lymphadentis, may occur [102] .",

Rapid antigen tests when positive are reliable in diagnosing GAS pharyngitis when the ordered in patients with a high pretest probability of having the disease [115] . Recovery of b-hemolytic streptococci from a sterile site should be taken as indication of a true infection, whereas the isolation of b-hemolytic streptococci from mucous membranes and skin are often without clinical significance. An exception to this rule is toxic shock syndrome, which can occur in the absence of invasive disease; thus a diagnosis of GAS-related toxic shock syndrome can be supported by isolation of the organism from a mucosal site [116] . Serologic tests are not useful in the acute setting in diagnosing disease due to b-hemolytic streptococci. Acute and convalescent serum for antibodies to streptolysin O or DNase can be sent to determine whether an infection with GAS has occurred although these tests are rarely used in a clinical setting [117] . Treatment b-hemolytic streptococci remain susceptible to penicillin and other b-lactam antibiotics, and these agents remain the drugs of choice for the treatment of infections due to b-hemolytic streptococci [118] . For patients who cannot receive b-lactams vancomycin is recommended although consideration should also be given to carbapenems if the penicillin allergy is not life threatening [119] . Macrolide and lincosamide resistance rates are highly variable, and these agents should not be used for serious infections without knowing strain susceptibility [120] . Many isolates are resistant to tetracyclines and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [121, 122] . Experience with newer Gram-positive agents such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and tigecycline is limited although in vitro data are promising [123, 124] . In cases of serious soft tissue infection, especially toxic shock syndrome, clindamycin is added to reduce toxin production by slowly dying GAS [125] . Uncomplicated bacteremia due to b-hemolytic streptococci can be treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics whereas complicated disease mandates longer therapy. Surgical debridement of devitalized tissue is mandatory when these agents cause necrotizing soft-tissue infections [113] .",

CSF Gram-stain and culture establish the diagnosis in nearly all patients who have not received antibiotics [134] .",

S. pneumoniae causing an infection that does not involve the central nervous system and will be treated with intravenous penicillin is considered susceptible if it is inhibited by \u00a32 mg/mL penicillin; in the United States at the present time, about 95% of all pneumococci are susceptible by this definition [138] . In a case of meningitis, inhibition by <0.06 mg/mL penicillin defines susceptibility; an MIC of \u00b30.12 mg/mL is defined as resistance with about 75% of pneumococcal isolates causing meningitis in the USA being susceptible by these criteria [138] . Pneumococcal isolates are universally susceptible to vancomycin and usually susceptible to quinolones for which there is extensive experience in treating most S. pneumoniae infections, except for meningitis [139] . S. pneumoniae resistance to macrolides, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracyclines ranges from 20 to 40% in the USA, and these drugs should not be used in treating cancer patients who have invasive pneumococcal disease [140] unless susceptibility has been proven by in vitro testing. There are increasing data indicating that linezolid is effective for S. pneumoniae infections whereas daptomycin is not used to treat pneumonia because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant [141] . Although mortality for invasive pneumococcal disease remains around 15% for the first 7 days after admission, most infections respond to relatively short course of antimicrobials with longer courses reserved for meningitis, empyema, and complicated bacteremia [134] .",

Unfortunately, it is these very adults who are least likely to respond to such vaccination [144] . In the past decade a protein-conjugated vaccine that includes capsular polysaccharides from seven pneumococcal types has been licensed for use in children. Widespread use of this vaccine in infants and toddlers has reduced the incidence of pneumococcal disease in the entire population; however, replacement by other pneumococcal types has eroded vaccine efficacy in the population at large [129] .",

Enterococci are considered to be low virulence pathogens, and enterococcal infections often have a minimal inflammatory component [150] . Fever may or may not be present even in cases of bacteremia [151] . Culture is the mainstay of diagnosis with serologic or antigen tests being of no value. The isolation of enterococci from nonsterile specimens such as urine, sputum, or draining wounds usually represents colonization or subclinical infection rather than infection that requires treatment. Prescribing antibiotics in this situation generally fails to eradicate the organism while promoting the development of antimicrobial resistance and exposing the patient to potentially serious side effects [152] . Even when isolated from sterile sites, such as the abdominal cavity, enterococci are usually present along with one or more other organisms [153] , and treatment of more virulent pathogens has been shown to cure such infections even in the absence of targeted enterococcal therapy [151] . This concept is illustrated by the highly effective nature of cephalosporins in treating intra-abdominal infections despite having no anti-enterococcal activity [154] .",

Most E. faecalis isolates remain relatively susceptible to penicillins, specifically penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin (not nafcillin) and carbapenems (for example, imipenem), but are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins [155] . In contrast, penicillin resistance among E. faecium isolates exceeds 50% [155] . Enterococci are generally resistant to macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones [156] . Vancomycin has been the drug of choice for treating enterococci resistant to b-lactam agents, but rates of VRE have increased dramatically over the past 20 years [152] . Enterococci are tolerant to b-lactam antibiotics, meaning that they are inhibited but not killed by them; this becomes clinically meaningful in treating endocarditis and, perhaps, infections in neutropenic patients, as well [152] . A bactericidal effect may be achieved against some isolates by the addition of an aminoglycoside. Because, in this instance, the killing is attributable to the aminoglycosides, no synergy occurs against strains that are highly resistant to aminoglycosides, and such resistance has been increasing [157] . The emergence of VRE has left physicians with relatively few treatment options. Linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin are the only drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of infections due to VRE, although both drugs have significant limitations such as a lack of efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin against E. faecalis [158] . In vitro data with daptomycin and tigecycline are encouraging although emergence of resistance and reports of clinical failures are concerning [159] . The lack of clear clinical data regarding VRE treatment has recently led the Infectious Diseases Society of America to declare that determining optimal VRE treatment strategies is an area of paramount importance [160] .",

            "text": "For many years empiric antimicrobial treatment of cancer patients with possible bacterial infections focused on Gramnegative pathogens, because bacteremic infection with these organisms was associated with a high risk of death [75] . The increased rates of isolation of Gram-positive pathogens has led many physicians to add an anti-Gram-positive antimicrobial, such as vancomycin or linezolid, when treating cancer patients with suspected infection [161] , even though the same risk for death has not been documented for Grampositive compared with Gram-negative bacteremia [66, 162] . In fact, clinical trials demonstrate no clinical benefit for the addition of targeted anti-Gram positive antimicrobials in empiric treatment regimens [94, 163, 164] . Widespread use of vancomycin and other targeted anti-Gram-positive agents is a major factor contributing to the emergence of such multidrug resistant organisms as VRE [165] . Nonetheless, the practice of adding vancomycin or other targeted Grampositive antimicrobials empirically in neutropenic patients with fever and, by extension, in many other cancer patients who are not neutropenic, remains pervasive [166] . Taken together, these factors have led to specific recommendations against adding empiric anti-Gram-positive treatment in patients with cancer and suspected infection [94] . Institutional attempts to limit additional empiric anti-Gram-positive antimicrobial treatment to patients with specific risk factors have had limited success to date, but provide some hope for minimizing the overuse of antimicrobial agents [4] . Historically, a broad array of Gram-positive pathogens have shown the remarkable ability to overcome any widely prescribed antimicrobial, and thus antimicrobial conservation may play a pivotal role in the long-term control of these prevalent organisms [167] .",
