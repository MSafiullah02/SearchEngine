            "text": "Since its identification in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) (Zaki et al., 2012) and Jordan (Hijawi et al., 2013) in 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has become a global public health threat. Typical of an emerging zoonosis, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has an animal reservoir, i.e. dromedary camels in which the virus causes little to no disease (Mohd et al., 2016). Many details about the extent of circulation and the mechanisms of transmission within dromedary camel herds, or factors related to zoonotic transmission and differences in circulating MERS-CoV strains, remain unknown. The virus has repeatedly spilled over from dromedary camels to humans, principally in countries on the Arabian Peninsula, causing significant morbidity and mortality (World Health Organization, 2017a; Azhar et al., 2014). Clusters of cases in the community and among family members are rare (World Health Organization, 2017a; Drosten et al., 2014). However, delays in diagnosis in hospitals has sometimes led to secondary cases among health care workers, patients sharing rooms or family members as a result of unprotected direct contact with a patient before isolation. This human-to-human transmission in health care facilities can sometimes be amplified, causing very large outbreaks, as has been seen in the Middle East and in the Republic of Korea, with significant public health and economic impacts (Hijawi et al., 2013; Assiri et al., 2013; Al-Abdallat et al., 2014; Drosten et al., 2015; Al Hosani et al., 2016; Ki, 2015; Park et al., 2015). As of August 2018, more than 2249 human cases from 27 countries have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization, 2017a).",

In addition, a number of countries in the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa have engaged in research activities and surveillance of camel populations to shed light on the wider distribution of this virus or investigate transmission patterns and routes for viral shedding. As a follow-up to previous meetings (World Health Organization, 2016; FAO, 2016, 2014; WHO Regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2014; WHO Regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2013b, 2013c), FAO, OIE and WHO Tripartite held a Global Technical Meeting on MERS-CoV with representatives from Ministries of Health and Ministries of Agriculture, subject matter experts, researchers, funders and industrial partners from 25 to 27 September 2017 in Geneva, Switzerland (see Supplementary Information) (World Health Organization et al., 2017).

However, small case numbers make the evaluation of their impact on morbidity and mortality from MERS-CoV infection difficult (Arabi et al., 2017a; Arabi et al., 2017b; Arabi et al.; Al-Dorzi et al., 2016; Sheahan et al., 2017; Ko et al., 2018; Arabi et al., 2017c). Several pre-clinical and phase I-III studies are under way or in the design phase (outlined by the WHO R&D Blueprint: http://who-blueprint-mapping-tool.surge.sh/). WHO is currently evaluating all available evidence on therapeutics to update guidance on clinical management of patients and in the process to develop standardized clinical trial protocols that could be used in affected countries to evaluate promising therapeutic candidates.",
