They have been applied to the generation of recombinant coronaviruses, selectable replicon RNAs, and coronavirus-based vectors for heterologous gene expression. Here we provide a collection of protocols for the generation, cloning, and modification of full-length coronavirus cDNA using vaccinia virus as a cloning vector. Based on cloned coronaviral cDNA, we describe the generation of recombinant coronaviruses and stable cell lines containing coronaviral replicon RNAs. Initially, the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system was established for the generation of recombinant human coronavirus 229E. However, it is also applicable to the generation of other coronaviruses, such as the avian infectious bronchitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and SARS coronavirus.",

            "text": "The extraordinarily large size of the positive-stranded coronavirus RNA genome posed a significant obstacle for the establishment of coronavirus reverse genetic systems based on cloned full-length cDNA. Conventional cloning techniques using plasmid DNA cloning vectors were not suitable to stably accommodate large coronaviral cDNAs. Moreover, in numerous cases, specific coronaviral cDNA sequences turned out to be resistant to cloning in conventional plasmid DNAs or C Humana Press, New York, NY 18,  were unstable upon propagation in prokaryotic hosts. Finally, however, several laboratories succeeded in establishing coronavirus reverse genetic systems based on full-length cDNA (1-3). Not surprisingly, those researchers had to solve the problem of \"cDNA instability\" and, accordingly, the solutions they provided are all based on nonconventional approaches. The reverse genetic system described here is based on the use of a vaccinia virus as a cloning vector that replicates in eukaryotic cells. Vaccinia virus is a large DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 200 kb that is able to stably accommodate foreign DNA sequences of coronavirus genome size (27-31 bp). The basic techniques required to clone (Section 3.1), modify (Section 3.2), and rescue (Section 3.3) recombinant coronaviruses are described. One application of the system, namely, the generation of coronavirus replicon RNAs and cell lines, is described in Section 3.4.",

            "text": "Full-Length cDNA 1 . Analyze the coronavirus genome for useful naturally encoded endonuclease restriction sites that can later be used to ligate cloned cDNA inserts. Preferably use restriction enzymes that produce nonpalindromic sticky ends with at least three nucleotide (nt) overhangs. Avoid the use of restriction enzymes that generate blunt ends, since ligation efficiencies of blunt end fragments are low. If there are no useful sites available at particular regions of the cDNA sequence, restriction sites may be generated that introduce silent nucleotide changes. Alternatively, introduce sites at the border of the coronavirus cDNA fragments for restriction enzymes that cleave outside of their recognition sequence and orientate the sites so that cleavage occurs in the coronavirus cDNA region (Fig. 1A) . 2. Generate a set of plasmid DNAs covering the entire coronavirus cDNA using standard plasmid DNA cloning techniques. cDNA insert fragments should have a size of approximately 5 kb. Make sure that the cDNA fragment borders are flanked by appropriate endonuclease restriction sites in order to release the cloned cDNA fragments by endonuclease digestion (see above). If particular plasmid clones appear unstable upon propagation in Escherichia coli, change the plasmid backbone, preferably to a low copy plasmid. If plasmid DNAs remain unstable upon propagation proceed with the cloning of the remaining part of the coronavirus cDNA and insert the respective unstable cDNA sequence on the vaccinia virus level by vaccinia virus-mediated recombination using RT-PCR cDNA fragments (see Section 3.2). 3. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the 5'-and 3'-end of the genome should contain additional sequences as follows (Fig. 2) C  G  T  A  N  T  A  G  A   C  T  A  T  C  A  A  A  T  T  T  G  T  T  T  A  A  A   BsaI coronavirus cDNA Fig. 1 . Strategies to minimize the number of possible ligation products: (A) Ligation of two coronavirus cDNA fragments using BsaI restriction endonuclease. BsaI recognition sequences can be engineered adjacent to the coronavirus cDNA to obtain BsaI-cleaved cDNA ends without heterologous sequences. The sticky ends are not palindromic and are comprised of a coronavirus-encoded sequence. The subsequent ligation reaction is directional and gives rise to only one possible reaction product. (B) The use of alkaline phosphatase to reduce the number of possible ligation products is illustrated. The left panel shows a conventional ligation using cDNA fragments with palindromic sticky ends. In this case three different ligation products are possible. The right panel shows a ligation reaction if one cDNA fragment has been dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase prior to the ligation reaction. In this case only two ligation products are possible.

The unique restriction site is needed for the generation of runoff in vitro transcripts. Furthermore, an EagI or Bsp120I site is needed to insert the cDNA into the NotI site of the vaccinia virus genome by in vitro ligation. If the coronavirus sequence does not encode an EagI or Bsp120I site, the unique site is not needed since EagI or Bsp120I cleavage can be done to produce templates for the generation of runoff in vitro transcripts.",

Perform another two rounds of gpt + plaque selection (steps 4 and 5) by infecting the CV-1 cells with 5-20 l of a picked plaque. Always perform freeze-thaw cycles and sonication prior to infection. 7. After the third round of plaque selection infect CV-1 cells in a six-well dish with half of a picked plaque and culture cells until full CPE. Store half of this stock for further use and use the other half for DNA preparation and analysis of the recombinant vaccinia virus clone (i.e., PCR, Southern blot, sequencing).",

When purifying DNA fragments from agarose gels, cut small slices at the edges of the fragment band out of the gel and stain them with ethidium bromide. Use UV light to visualize the borders of the DNA band in the slices and mark the position. Insert the slices back into the gel and cut the piece of agarose between the two marked positions out of the gel. The DNA recovered from those agarose pieces have not been exposed to UV light and are easily clonable in vaccinia virus. 2. It is possible to insert more than one DNA fragment into the vaccina virus genome by in vitro ligation (37). Up to three DNA fragments can be ligated prior to adding NotI-cleaved vaccinia virus DNA (see Section 3.1.4, step 1). However, we recommend this procedure only if the fragments can be efficiently ligated (a full-length cDNA fragment should be visible in agarose gels). Furthermore, the number of possible ligation products should be minimized using strategies illustrated in Fig. 1 and dephosphorylated. Therefore: (i) insert-insert ligation is not possible (owing to dephophorylated ends), and (ii) Eag or Bsp120I-NotI ligation products (i.e., insert-vector ligation) are not recleavable with NotI. As a result the ligationrestriction reaction will drive the overall reaction toward an accumulation of insert-vector ligation products. 7. The ligation-restriction reaction may still contain a small proportion of unrecleaved vector-vector ligation products. These products may lead to functional vaccinia virus genomes without the insert cDNA fragment and may cause a high background in the rescue of recombinant vaccinia viruses (Section 3.1.5). We therefore recommend an additional NotI cleavage reaction after the ligationrestriction reaction. 8 Six plaques is a reasonable number to pick. There is a limited risk of picking \"false\" plaques or plaques contaminated by parental virus that necessitates selection of a few plaques in parallel. 13. D980R cells grow fast and vaccinia virus plaques are not as easily recognizable as on CV-1 cells. During the selection it is necessary to keep cells in good condition to facilitate the formation of easily detectable plaques. The risk of overgrowth can be reduced by seeding cells at a lower density, and cell death from starvation can be reduced by replacing the medium with fresh selection medium on day 2 p.i..",

This can be achieved by using a tight Dounce homogenisator or, as described here, by using the MagNA Lyser protocol. To establish appropriate conditions we recommend doing a pilot experiment in which several conditions are compared. After homogenization check for virus titers and decide for the most vigorous homogenization conditions that still leave the virus particles intact. 4. This step results in DNase digestion of free DNA (mostly of cellular origin) and will leave the DNA in virus particles intact. 5. Vaccinia virus genomic DNA has a size of approximately 200 kb. Standard pipette tips are usually too narrow and pipetting will result in shearing the DNA.To avoid this, cut the pipette tips to generate an opening of about 2-3 mm and avoid vigorous pipetting. Avoid drying the DNA. If the large vaccinia virus DNA is overdried it will no longer be possible to dissolve it in water. 6. The ligation of insert DNA fragment(s) and the NotI-cleaved vaccinia virus arms is facilitated by adding NotI into the ligation reaction (11). Religated vaccinia virus arms are recleaved by the NotI enzyme allowing a new round of ligation. The 5'-and 3'-ends of the insert fragment are cleaved with EagI or Bsp120I",

We recommend fowlpox virus as a helper virus, since a fowlpox virus infection is abortive in mammalian cells, but can still serve to rescue vaccinia virus from DNA. Therefore, the recovered viruses will be vaccinia virus only (and no fowlpox virus). 9. On days 2-4 p.i. the cells may look heavily infected, most likely owing to fowlpox virus infection. However, recombinant vaccinia virus cannot yet be expected in the cell culture. Just continue to cultivate the cells; most cell layers will recover. Usually, the first vaccinia virus-mediated CPE can be expected on day 5 p.i. and a peak is observed around day 7 p.i.. If cells get too confluent the medium can be changed. 10. Freeze-thawing and sonication is needed to release and separate vaccinia virus particles from the cells and cell debris. For selection of pure recombinant vaccinia virus this procedure is critical. 11. A ratio of 1:1000 of recombinant vaccinia viruses:parental vaccinia viruses can be expected. Thus, under selection pressure, single plaques should appear on CV-1 cell layers that have been infected with a 10 -3 dilution of the transfection stock. At 2 h p.i., an overlay of 1% low-melting agarose in selection medium can be made. This is done to reduce the risk of contamination of recombinant plaques with parental virus. Because most vaccinia virus is contained within an infected cell within the time frame (2-3 days) of the selection, agarose overlays are usually not necessary. 12.",
