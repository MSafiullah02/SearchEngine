Facing the financial crisis, this question was brilliantly articulated by the Nobel prize winner of 2008, Paul Krugman, in the New York Times [2]. A number of prominent economists even sees a failure of academic economics [3]. Remarkably, the following declaration has been signed by more than 2000 scientists [4]: \u201cFew economists saw our current crisis coming, but this predictive failure was the least of the field\u2019s problems. More important was the profession\u2019s blindness to the very possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy \u2026 the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth \u2026 economists fell back in love with the old, idealized vision of an economy in which rational individuals interact in perfect markets, this time gussied up with fancy equations \u2026 Unfortunately, this romanticized and sanitized vision of the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that can go wrong. They turned a blind eye to the limitations of human rationality that often lead to bubbles and busts; to the problems of institutions that run amok; to the imperfections of markets\u2014especially financial markets\u2014that can cause the economy\u2019s operating system to undergo sudden, unpredictable crashes; and to the dangers created when regulators don\u2019t believe in regulation. \u2026 When it comes to the all-too-human problem of recessions and depressions, economists need to abandon the neat but wrong solution of assuming that everyone is rational and markets work perfectly.\u201d",

According to our perception, the economic challenges we are currently facing can only be mastered by large-scale, multi-disciplinary efforts and by innovative approaches [6]. We fully recognize the large variety of non-mainstream approaches that has been developed by \u201cheterodox economists\u201d. However, the research traditions in economics seem to be so powerful that these are not paid much attention to. Besides, there is no agreement on which of the alternative modeling approaches would be the most promising ones, i.e. the heterogeneity of alternatives is one of the problems, which slows down their success. This situation clearly implies institutional challenges as well, but these go beyond the scope of this contribution and will therefore be addressed in the future.",

Before addressing related fundamental scientific challenges in economics, we will therefore point out practical challenges one needs to pay attention to. This basically requires to classify the multitude of problems into packages of interrelated problems. Probably, such classification attempts are subjective to a certain extent. At least, the list presented below differs from the one elaborated by Lomborg et al. [7], who identified the following top ten problems: air pollution, security/conflict, disease control, education, climate change, hunger/malnutrition, water sanitation, barriers to migration and trade, transnational terrorism and, finally, women and development. The following (non-ranked) list, in contrast, is more focused on socio-economic factors rather than resource and engineering issues, and it is more oriented at the roots of problems rather than their symptoms:\n\nDemographic change of the population structure (change of birth rate, migration, integration\u2026)\nFinancial and economic (in)stability (government debts, taxation, and inflation/ deflation; sustainability of social benefit systems; consumption and investment behavior\u2026)\nSocial, economic and political participation and inclusion (of people of different gender, age, health, education, income, religion, culture, language, preferences; reduction of unemployment\u2026)\nBalance of power in a multi-polar world (between different countries and economic centers; also between individual and collective rights, political and company power; avoidance of monopolies; formation of coalitions; protection of pluralism, individual freedoms, minorities\u2026)\nCollective social behavior and opinion dynamics (abrupt changes in consumer behavior; social contagion, extremism, hooliganism, changing values; breakdown of cooperation, trust, compliance, solidarity\u2026)\nSecurity and peace (organized crime, terrorism, social unrest, independence movements, conflict, war\u2026)\nInstitutional design (intellectual property rights; over-regulation; corruption; balance between global and local, central and decentral control\u2026)\nSustainable use of resources and environment (consumption habits, travel behavior, sustainable and efficient use of energy and other resources, participation in recycling efforts, environmental protection\u2026)\nInformation management (cyber risks, misuse of sensitive data, espionage, violation of privacy; data deluge, spam; education and inheritance of culture\u2026)\nPublic health (food safety; spreading of epidemics [flu, SARS, H1N1, HIV], obesity, smoking, or unhealthy diets\u2026)\n",

It assumes that people would have quasi-infinite memory and processing capacities and would determine the best one among all possible alternative behaviors by strategic thinking (systematic utility optimization), and would implement it into practice without mistakes. The Nobel prize winner of 1976, Milton Friedman, supported the hypothesis of homo economicus by the following argument: \u201cirrational agents will lose money and will be driven out of the market by rational agents\u201d [11]. More recently, Robert E. Lucas Jr., the Nobel prize winner of 1995, used the rationality hypothesis to narrow down the class of empirically relevant equilibria [12].",

            "text": "It is, therefore, no wonder that people have repeatedly expressed doubts regarding the realism of the rational agent approach [13, 14]. Bertrand Russell, for example, claimed: \u201cMost people would rather die than think\u201d. While this seems to be a rather extreme opinion, the following scientific arguments must be taken seriously:\nHuman cognitive capacities are bounded [16, 17]. Already phone calls or conversations can reduce people\u2019s attention to events in the environment a lot. Also, the abilities to memorize facts and to perform complicated logical analyses are clearly limited.In case of NP-hard optimization problems, even supercomputers are facing limits, i.e. optimization jobs cannot be performed in real-time anymore. Therefore, approximations or simplifications such as the application of heuristics may be necessary. In fact, psychologists have identified a number of heuristics, which people use when making decisions [18].People perform strategic thinking mainly in important new situations. In normal, everyday situation, however, they seem to pursue a satisficing rather than optimizing strategy [17]. Meeting a certain aspiration level rather than finding the optimal strategy can save time and energy spent on problem solving. In many situation, people even seem to perform routine choices [14], for example, when evading other pedestrians in counterflows.There is a long list of cognitive biases which question rational behavior [19]. For example, individuals are favorable of taking small risks (which are preceived as \u201cchances\u201d, as the participation in lotteries shows), but they avoid large risks [20]. Furthermore, non-exponential temporal discounting may lead to paradoxical behaviors [21] and requires one to rethink, how future expectations must be modeled.Most individuals have a tendency towards other-regarding behavior and fairness [22, 23]. For example, the dictator game [24] and other experiments [25] show that people tend to share, even if there is no reason for this. Leaving a tip for the waiter in a restaurant that people visit only once is a typical example (particularly in countries where tipping is not common) [26]. Such behavior has often been interpreted as sign of social norms. While social norms can certainly change the payoff structure, it has been found that the overall payoffs resulting from them do not need to create a user or system optimum [27\u201329]. This suggests that behavioral choices may be irrational in the sense of non-optimal. A typical example is the existence of unfavorable norms, which are supported by people although nobody likes them [30].Certain optimization problems can have an infinite number of local optima or Nash equilibria, which makes it impossible to decide what is the best strategy [31].Convergence towards the optimal solution may require such a huge amount of time that the folk theorem becomes useless. This can make it practically impossible to play the best response strategy [32].The optimal strategy may be deterministically chaotic, i.e. sensitive to arbitrarily small details of the initial condition, which makes the dynamic solution unpredictable on the long run (\u201cbutterfly effect\u201d) [33, 34]. This fundamental limit of predictability also implies a limit of control\u2014two circumstances that are even more true for non-deterministic systems with a certain degree of randomness.\n",

In fact, most methods used in financial trading (such as technical analysis) are not well compatible with the rational agent approach. Even if an optimal solution exists, it may be undecidable for practical reasons or for theoretical ones [35, 36]. This is also relevant for the following challenges, as boundedly rational agents may react inefficently and with delays, which questions the efficient market hypothesis, the equilibrium paradigm, and other fundamental concepts, calling for the consideration of spatial, network, and time-dependencies, heterogeneity and correlations etc. It will be shown that these points can have dramatic implications regarding the predictions of economic models.",

Curiously enough, however, he also wrote a book on \u201cThe Theory of Moral Sentiments\u201d [40]. \u201cHis goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind\u2019s ability to form moral judgements, in spite of man\u2019s natural inclinations towards self-interest. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behavior \u2026 [and] seek the approval of the \u201cimpartial spectator\u201d as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathize with them\u201d [38].

The following list gives a number of empirical and theoretical arguments questioning the efficient market hypothesis:\nExamples of market failures are well-known and can result, for example, in cases of monopolies or oligopolies, if there is not enough liquidity or if information symmetry is not given.While the concept of the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d assumes something like an optimal self-organization [44], it is well-known that this requires certain conditions, such as symmetrical interactions. In general, however, self-organization does not necessarily imply system-optimal solutions. Stop-and-go traffic [45] or crowd disasters [46] are two obvious examples for systems, in which individuals competitively try to reach individually optimal outcomes, but where the optimal solution is dynamically unstable.The limited processing capacity of boundedly rational individuals implies potential delays in their responses to sensorial inputs, which can cause such instabilities [47]. For example, a delayed adaptation in production systems may contribute to the occurrence of business cycles [48]. The same applies to the labor market of specially skilled people, which cannot adjust on short time scales. Even without delayed reactions, however, the competitive optimization of individuals can lead to suboptimal individual results, as the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in public goods dilemmas demonstrates [49, 50].Bubbles and crashes, or more generally, extreme events in financial markets should not occur, if the efficient market hypothesis was correct (see next subsection).Collective social behavior such as \u201cherding effects\u201d as well as deviations of human behavior from what is expected from rational agents can lead to such bubbles and crashes [51], or can further increase their size through feedback effects [52]. Cyclical feedbacks leading to oscillations are also known from the beer game [53] or from business cycles [48].\n",

Theoretically, it is not obvious that such a system would have a stationary solution. For example, the system could behave periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic, or turbulent [81\u201383, 85\u201387, 94]. In all these cases, there would be no convergence to a stationary solution.If a stationary solution exists, it is not clear that there are no further stationary solutions. If many variables are non-linearly coupled, the phenomenon of multi-stability can easily occur [55]. That is, the solution to which the system converges may not only depend on the model parameters, but also on the initial condition, history, or perturbation size. Such facts are known as path-dependencies or hysteresis effects and are usually visualized by so-called phase diagrams [56].In systems of non-linearly interacting variables, the existence of a stationary solution does not necessarily imply that it is stable, i.e. that the system will converge to this solution. For example, the stationary solution could be a focal point with orbiting solutions (as for the classical Lotka-Volterra equations [57]), or it could be unstable and give rise to a limit cycle [58] or a chaotic solution [33], for example (see also item 1). In fact, experimental results suggest that volatility clusters in financial markets may be a result of over-reactions to deviations from the fundamental value [59].An infinite relaxation rate is rather unusual, as most decisions and related implemenations take time [15, 60].\n",

The dynamics in such systems has, for example, been described by the method of comparative statics (i.e. a series of snapshots). Here, the system is assumed to be in equilibrium in each moment, but the equilibrium changes adiabatically (i.e. without delay), as the system parameters change (e.g. through new facts). Such a treatment of system dynamics, however, has certain deficiencies:\nThe approach cannot explain changes in or of the system, such as phase transitions (\u201csystemic shifts\u201d), when the system is at a critical point (\u201ctipping point\u201d).It does not allow one to understand innovations and other changes as results of an endogeneous system dynamics.It cannot describe effects of delays or instabilities, such as overshooting, self-organization, emergence, systemic breakdowns or extreme events (see Sect. 16.3.4).It does not allow one to study effects of different time scales. For example, when there are fast autocatalytic (self-reinfocing) effects and slow inhibitory effects, this may lead to pattern formation phenomena in space and time [63, 64]. The formation of settlements, where people agglomerate in space, may serve as an example [65, 66].It ignores long-term correlations such as memory effects.It neglects frictional effects, which are often proportional to change (\u201cspeed\u201d) and occur in most complex systems. Without friction, however, it is difficult to understand entropy and other path-dependent effects, in particular irreversibility (i.e. the fact that the system may not be able to get back to the previous state) [67]. For example, the unemployment rate has the property that it does not go back to the previous level in most countries after a business cycle [68].\n",

It is know, however, that linear models have special features, which are not representative for the rich variety of possible functional dependencies, dynamics, and outcomes. Therefore, the neglection of non-linearity has serious consequences:\nAs it was mentioned before, phenomena like multiple equilibria, chaos or turbulence cannot be understood by linear models. The same is true for self-organization phenomena or emergence. Additionally, in non-linearly coupled systems, usually \u201cmore is different\u201d, i.e. the system may change its behavior fundamentally as it grows beyond a certain size. Furthermore, the system is often hard to predict and difficult to control (see Sect. 16.3.8).Linear modeling tends to overlook that a strong coupling of variables, which would show a normally distributed behavior in separation, often leads to fat tail distributions (such as \u201cpower laws\u201d) [70, 71]. This implies that extreme events are much more frequent than expected according to a Gaussian distribution. For example, when additive noise is replaced by multiplicative noise, a number of surprising phenomena may result, including noise-induced transitions [72] or directed random walks (\u201cratchet effects\u201d) [73].Phenomena such as catastrophes [74] or phase transition (\u201csystem shifts\u201d) [75] cannot be well understood within a linear modeling framework. The same applies to the phenomenon of \u201cself-organized criticality\u201d [79] (where the system drives itself to a critical state, typically with power-law characteristics) or cascading effects, which can result from network interactions (overcritically challenged network nodes or links) [77, 78]. It should be added that the relevance of network effects resulting from the on-going globalization is often underestimated. For example, \u201cthe stock market crash of 1987, began with a small drop in prices which triggered an avalanche of sell orders in computerized trading programs, causing a further price decline that triggered more automatic sales.\u201d [80]\n",

According to this, everybody should free-ride, i.e. nobody should make a contribution to the public good and nobody would gain anything. However, if everybody would contribute, everybody could multiply his or her contribution by the synergy factor. This example is particularly relevant as society is facing a lot of public goods problems and would not work without cooperation. Everything from the creation of public infrastructures (streets, theaters, universities, libraries, schools, the World Wide Web, Wikipedia etc.) over the use of environmental resources (water, forests, air, etc.) or of social benefit systems (such as a public health insurance), maybe even the creation and maintainance of a commonly shared language and culture are public goods problems (although the last examples are often viewed as coordination problems).

Partially related to Adam Smith\u2019s belief in an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d, one often assumes underlying coordination games and that they would automatically create a harmony between an individually and system optimal state in the course of time [54]. However, running a stable financial system and economy is most likely a public goods problem. Considering unemployment, recessions always go along with a breakdown of solidarity and cooperation. Efficient production clearly requires mutual cooperation (as the counter-example of countries with many strikes illustrates). The failure of the interbank market when banks stop lending to each other, is a good example for the breakdown of both, trust and cooperation. We must be aware that there are many other systems that would not work anymore, if people would lose their trust: electronic banking, e-mail and internet use, Facebook, eBusiness and eGovernance, for example. Money itself would not work without trust, as bank panics and hyperinflation scenarios show. Similarly, cheating customers by selling low-quality products or selling products at overrated prices, or by manipulating their choices by advertisements rather than informing them objectively and when they want, may create profits on the short run, but it affects the trust of customers (and their willingness to invest). The failure of the immunization campaign during the swine flu pandemics may serve as an example. Furthermore, people would probably spend more money, if the products of competing companies were better compatible with each other. Therefore, on the long run, more cooperation among companies and with the customers would pay off and create additional value.",

According to what is known from critical phenomena in physics, this approximation is valid only, when the interactions take place in high-dimensional spaces or if the system elements are well connected. (However, as the example of the public goods dilemma showed, this case does not necessarily have beneficial consequences. Well-mixed interactions could rather cause a breakdown of social or economic institutions, and it is conceivable that this played a role in the recent financial crisis.)Percolation phenomena, describing how far an idea, innovation, technology, or (computer) virus spreads through a social or business network, are not well reproduced, as they depend on details of the network structure, not just on the average node degree [103].The heterogeneity of agents is ignored. For this reason, factors underlying economic exchange, perturbations, or systemic robustness [104] cannot be well described. Moreover, as socio-economic differentiation and specialization imply heterogeneity, they cannot be understood as emergent phenomena within a representative agent approach. Finally, it is not possible to grasp innovation without the consideration of variability. In fact, according to evolutionary theory, the innovation rate would be zero, if the variability was zero [105]. Furthermore, in order to explain innovation in modern societies, Schumpeter introduced the concept of the \u201cpolitical entrepreneur\u201d [106], an extra-ordinarily gifted person capable of creating disruptive change and innovation. Such an extraordinary individual can, by definition, not be modeled by a \u201crepresentative agent\u201d.\n",

            "text": "One of the great achievements of economics is that it has developed a multitude of methods to use scarce resources efficiently. A conventional approach to this is optimization. In principle, there is nothing wrong about this approach. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with the way it is usually applied:\nOne can only optimize for one goal at a time, while usually, one needs to meet several objectives. This is mostly addressed by weighting the different goals (objectives), by executing a hierarchy of optimization steps (through ranking and prioritization), or by applying a satisficing strategy (requiring a minimum performance for each goal) [119, 120]. However, when different optimization goals are in conflict with each other (such as maximizing the throughput and minimizing the queue length in a production system), a sophisticated time-dependent strategy may be needed [121].There is no unique rule what optimization goal should be chosen. Low costs? High profit? Best customer satisfaction? Large throughput? Competitive advantage? Resilience? [122] In fact, the choice of the optimization function is arbitrary to a certain extent and, therefore, the result of optimization may vary largely. Goal selection requires strategic decisions, which may involve normative or moral factors (as in politics). In fact, one can often observe that, in the course of time, different goal functions are chosen. Moreover, note that the maximization of certain objectives such as resilience or \u201cfitness\u201d depends not only on factors that are under the control of a company. Resilience and \u201cfitness\u201d are functions of the whole system, in particularly, they also depend on the competitors and the strategies chosen by them.The best solution may be the combination of two bad solutions and may, therefore, be overlooked. In other words, there are \u201cevolutionary dead ends\u201d, so that gradual optimization may not work. (This problem can be partially overcome by the application of evolutionary mechanisms [120]).In certain systems (such as many transport, logistic, or production systems), optimization tends to drive the system towards instability, since the point of maximum efficiency is often in the neighborhood or even identical with the point of breakdown of performance. Such breakdowns in capacity or performance can result from inefficiencies due to dynamic interaction effects. For example, when traffic flow reaches its maximum capacity, sooner or later it breaks down. As a consequence, the road capacity tends to drop during the time period where it is most urgently needed, namely during the rush hour [45, 123].Optimization often eliminates reduncancies in the system and, thereby, increases the vulnerability to perturbations, i.e. it decreases robustness and resilience.Optimization tends to eliminate heterogeneity in the system [80], while heterogeneity frequently supports adaptability and resilience.Optimization is often performed with centralized concepts (e.g. by using supercomputers that process information collected all over the system). Such centralized systems are vulnerable to disturbances or failures of the central control unit. They are also sensitive to information overload, wrong selection of control parameters, and delays in adaptive feedback control. In contrast, decentralized control (with a certain degree of autonomy of local control units) may perform better, when the system is complex and composed of many heterogeneous elements, when the optimization problem is NP hard, the degree of fluctuations is large, and predictability is restricted to short time periods [77, 124]. Under such conditions, decentralized control strategies can perform well by adaptation to the actual local conditions, while being robust to perturbations. Urban traffic light control is a good example for this [121, 125].Further on, today\u2019s concept of quality control appears to be awkward. It leads to a never-ending contest, requiring people and organizations to fulfil permanently increasing standards. This leads to over-emphasizing measured performance criteria, while non-measured success factors are neglected. The engagement into non-rewarded activities is discouraged, and innovation may be suppressed (e.g. when evaluating scientists by means of their h-index, which requires them to focus on a big research field that generates many citations in a short time).While so-called \u201cbeauty contests\u201d are considered to produce the best results, they will eventually absorb more and more resources for this contest, while less and less time remains for the work that is actually to be performed, when the contest is won. Besides, a large number of competitors have to waste considerable resources for these contests which, of course, have to be paid by someone. In this way, private and public sectors (from physicians over hospitals, administrations, up to schools and universities) are aching under the evaluation-related administrative load, while little time remains to perform the work that the corresponding experts have been trained for. It seems na\u00efve to believe that this would not waste resources. Rather than making use of individual strengths, which are highly heterogeneous, today\u2019s way of evaluating performance enforces a large degree of conformity.\n",

Physics also has a lot of experience how to theoretically deal with problems such as time-dependence, fluctuations, friction, entropy, non-linearity, strong interactions, correlations, heterogeneity, and many-particle simulations (which can be easily extended towards multi-agent simulations). In fact, physics has influenced economic modeling already in the past. Macroeconomic models, for example, were inspired by thermodynamics. More recent examples of relevant contributions by physicists concern models of self-organizing conventions [54], of geographic agglomeration [65], of innovation spreading [142], or of financial markets [143], to mention just a few examples.",

Many econophysics solutions are interesting, but so far they are not broad and mighty enough to replace the rational agent paradigm with its large body of implications and applications. Nevertheless, considering the relatively small number of econophysicists, there have been many promising results. The probably largest fraction of publications in econophysics in the last years had a data-driven or computer modeling approach to financial markets [143]. But econophyics has more to offer than the analysis of financial data (such as fluctuations in stock and foreign currency exchange markets), the creation of interaction models for stock markets, or the development of risk management strategies. Other scientists have focused on statistical laws underlying income and wealth distributions, non-linear market dynamics, macroeconomic production functions and conditions for economic growth or agglomeration, sustainable economic systems, business cycles, microeconomic interaction models, network models, the growth of companies, supply and production systems, logistic and transport networks, or innovation dynamics and diffusion.

Besides scepticism on the side of many economists with regard to novel approaches introduced by \u201coutsiders\u201d, the limited resonance and level of interdisciplinary exchange in the past was also caused in part by econophysicists. In many cases, questions have been answered, which no economist asked, rather than addressing puzzles economists are interested in. Apart from this, the econophysics work was not always presented in a way that linked it to the traditions of economics and pointed out deficiencies of existing models, highlighting the relevance of the new approach well. Typical responses are: Why has this model been proposed and not another one? Why has this simplification been used (e.g. an Ising model of interacting spins rather than a rational agent model)? Why are existing models not good enough to describe the same facts? What is the relevance of the work compared to previous publications? What practical implications does the finding have? What kind of paradigm shift does the approach imply? Can existing models be modified or extended in a way that solves the problem without requiring a paradigm shift? Correspondingly, there have been criticisms not only by mainstream economists, but also by colleagues, who are open to new approaches [151].",

It is important to demonstrate what properties of economic systems cannot be understood for fundamental reasons within the mainstream framework (i.e. cannot be dealt with by additional terms within the modeling class that is conventionally used). In other words, one needs to show why a paradigm shift is unavoidable, and this requires careful argumentation. We are not claiming that this has not been done in the past, but it certainly takes an additional effort to explain the essence of the econophysics approach in the language of economics, particularly as mainstream economics may not always provide suitable terms and frameworks to do this. This is particularly important, as the number of econophysicists is small compared to the number of economists, i.e. a minority wants to convince an established majority. To be taken seriously, one must also demonstrate a solid knowledge of related previous work of economists, to prevent the stereotypical reaction that the subject of the paper has been studied already long time ago (tacitly implying that it does not require another paper or model to address what has already been looked at before).",
