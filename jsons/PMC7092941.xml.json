The evidence of induction of apoptosis by TGEV implies an involvement of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of TGE [1], [7]. However, it remains to be known which TGEV protein(s) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cells that support productive viral replication. Current evidence indicates that TGEV N protein might be involved in caspase-mediated proteolysis within the host cell [8]. Further studies revealed that the TGEV N protein could locate nucleolar and might possess the function to disrupt cell division [9]. However, whether TGEV N protein could affect cell division and cell apoptosis and the associated molecular mechanisms are not clear.",

Fig. 2B showed that the levels of p53 significantly increased at 18 h and 36 h after cells transfected with N-EGFP expression vector compared with EGFP empty vector-transfected cells and non-transfected groups. The amounts of p21 were slightly increased at 18 h, and significantly increased at 36 h in the cells expressed TGEV N gene. Furthermore, the expression of cyclin B1, cdc2 and cdk2 decreased in the cells expressed TGEV N gene compared with the control cells (Fig. 2B), which coincided with the changes of these cycle-related molecules in TGEV-infected cells.

Results showed that PFT-\u03b1 attenuated TGEV N protein-induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases (Fig. 4\nA). In addition, the apoptotic rate induced by TGEV N protein was slightly inhibited by PFT-\u03b1 (Fig. 4B). To further explore the roles of p53, we investigated the effects of PFT-\u03b1 on the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis regulating factors in TGEV N protein expressed PK-15 cells. As expected, incubation of PK-15 cells with PFT-\u03b1, cdc2, cdk2 and cyclin B1 expression slightly increased in TGEV N protein expressed PK-15 cells with PFT-\u03b1 treatment compared to that without PFT-\u03b1 treatment (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the translocation of Bax and cytochrome c was moderately reversed by PFT-\u03b1 treatment in TGEV N protein expressed PK-15 cells (Fig. 4C). The activity of caspase-3 was reduced in TGEV N protein expressed cells with PFT-\u03b1 treatment compared to the cells without PFT-\u03b1 treatment (Fig. 4D).

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr activates cell cycle inhibitor p21 to prevent cell proliferation by causing arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle [16]. Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 E4 protein induces G2/M arrest through inhibition or delay in the activation of cdk1/cyclin B1 kinase activity [17]. Chicken anemic virus (CAV) apoptin protein and Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) ICP0 protein can interfere with kinetochores to block cell cycle progression at G2/M phase [18], [19]. Previous studies have revealed that the TGEV N could locate nucleolar and might function to disrupt cell division [9]. Here, our results showed that expression of TGEV N protein activated p53 and up-regulated cell cycle inhibitor p21, and then inhibited the activation of cdc2/cyclin B1, leading to G2/M arrest, which was consistent with our previous results found in TGEV-infected cells [6], suggesting that TGEV N protein might play an important role in TGEV-induced cell cycle arrest. In previous studies, we found TGEV infection induces S and G2/M arrest, which is aimed to establish a pseudo-S phase state for viruses to replicate of their genomes [6]. The results presented in here also provided evidences for S phase arrest and following G2/M arrest, suggesting that TGEV N protein might play an important role in establishing a pseudo-S phase state for virus replication. The same phenomena were also found in other viruses [20].",
