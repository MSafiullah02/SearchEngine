The greater social distancing achieved with SCRT is a major advantage. An additional benefit is that the use of SCRT instead of CRT in this setting will have a substantial reduction in linear accelerator usage, will help avoid waiting time to start treatment and increase the ability of departments to treat all their patients in the setting of reduced staffing levels.",

A longer delay to surgery was associated with a reduction in post-operative and surgical morbidity but no difference in severe complications or re-operations. An admission rate of 6% was observed for the management of diarrhoea for patients who received SCRT and delay. 3D conformal radiotherapy techniques with a superior border of mid L5 were used. The use of SCRT and delay will result in approximately 10% of patients achieving a complete clinical response who may be offered an organ preservation strategy. If complete response is actively monitored, then further delay or even avoidance of surgery may be safely achieved (see below). Conversely, we note that this approach will delay the time to commencement of adjuvant chemotherapy, if considered indicated.",

The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is then considered with wide international variation in its use. The Polish-2 randomized phase III trial comparing CRT with SCRT followed by three two-weekly cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy reported similar cancer outcomes for local recurrence, DFS and OS[8]. The results of the phase III RAPIDO trial that compared CRT with pre-operative SCRT and 18 weeks of capecitabine + oxaliplatin chemotherapy are awaited. In this trial, only patients with very high-risk criteria for recurrence were included.
