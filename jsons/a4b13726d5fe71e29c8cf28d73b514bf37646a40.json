The effectiveness of MS is generally recognized, and many fundamental works in this field have been awarded with Nobel Prizes. The development of soft ionization and desorption of biological macromolecules, electro spray, and MALDI was the most important step for using MS in biology and medicine. Authors of these approach es, John Fenn and Koichi Tanaka, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002. In the present review we consider principles of MS and show its possibilities for studies on enveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses are characterized by the presence of a lipoprotein envelope around the nucleocapsid that the virus acquires on its \"budding\" from the cell mem brane [1] . The group of enveloped viruses includes many dangerous pathogens: viruses of influenza and respirato ry infections, hepatites, herpes, hemorrhagic fevers, human immunodeficiency, etc. Many of the data pre sented here refer to influenza virus, but this does not diminish the generality of using the approaches under consideration.",

The essential scheme of a mass spectrometer includes a source of ions, a system of their separation, and a detector (Fig. 1b) . Because the majority of biological molecules (including proteins and peptides) cannot be independently converted into the gas phase, special methods are required to prepare the sub stance and inject it into the measuring system. At present, proteins and peptides are subjected to soft ionization using two techniques that are more or less associated with co evaporation of the analyzed biopolymers with an evaporat ed carrier. These techniques are electrospray and ioniza tion under atmospheric pressure (ESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) (Fig. 1, c and d) . In both cases, ions of the protein or peptide molecules are produced as a result of detachment of one or a few protons.",

The excess electrostatic potential produced on the surface of the drop results in its explosion. Charged microdrops lose the solvent mole cules through collisions with molecules of air or an inert gas, and they explode repeatedly when the surface charge again overpowers the surface tension. On the entrance into the vacuum system of ion separation, a continuous flow of ions of the analyzed substance is produced. The ions have different charges (up to a maximal one) (Fig.  1c) . This ionization technique can be easily combined with a preliminary chromatographic system of separation, e.g. in a configuration with liquid chromatography (LC) MS/MS, and it is widely used to analyze hydrophilic compounds, especially of multicomponent mixtures. On the other hand, on analyzing hydrophobic compounds (especially if they are mixed, e.g. with lipids and deter gents) electrospray cannot be used because of strong sur face tension and use of nonpolar solvents. For such com pounds MALDI can be used for ionization.",

Peptide bonds are often broken in proteins and peptides and N terminal b ions and C terminal y ions are produced, but other bonds in the molecule can also be broken (Fig. 1e) . The fragmen tation can be strengthened by additional influences on the parent ion packet chosen with an ion selector. The addi tional fragmentation can be induced by collisions with molecules of a specially introduced inert gas (Collision Induced Dissociation (CID)), by photon absorption (Laser Induced Dissociation (LID)), electron transfer (Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD)), or by electron capture (Electron Capture Dissociation (ECD)) [3] . This determines the possibilities of using the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS, and also MS 3 , MS 4 , etc.) for more intensive analysis of individual peptides, more accurate description of the primary structure (up to de novo sequencing), and determination of posttranslational modifications.",

            "text": "Identification of proteins. MS is important for identi fication of proteins, and this can be done for a complex mixture after preliminary proteolysis of proteins with highly specific protease and for preliminarily separated proteins. One such strategy uses one dimensional gel electrophoresis plus LC MS/MS: before being analyzed by MS, a mixture of peptides from different proteins is separated by chromatography, and a database search is performed based on the fragmentation spectra of individ ual peptides (tandem mass spectrometry, MS/MS). However, handling of individual proteins significantly simplifies the subsequent analysis, allowing them to be identified by the peptide fingerprint to reveal in the spec tra signals different from the calculated ones, and, thus, to detect a priori unknown protein modifications. In this case the studied protein has to be isolated very carefully, e.g. using one dimensional or two dimensional gel elec trophoresis. Figure 2a presents the strategy for identification of a dimer (NA) 2 in a preparation of virions of influenza virus strain A/Chicken/Germany/49 (H10N7) upon separa tion of the proteins using one dimensional gel elec trophoresis according to Laemmli and staining with Coomassie. A fragment containing the studied protein is cut from the gel and hydrolyzed in situ, usually with high ly purified trypsin, and the peptides are eluted from the gel and analyzed by MALDI TOF MS, or MS/MS in some cases.",

The main pinpoints the Mascot algorithm relies on are the number of \"matched\" peptides and the protein sequence coverage by the matched peptides (Fig. 2b) .

The appropriateness of using one of the various algorithms is also associated with the experiment speci ficity (preparation of the specimen, MS analysis tech nique).

Proteins of the purified virions were fractionated by Laemmli elec trophoresis, and then the entire gel lane was cut into thin strips, which were then subjected to tryptic hydrolysis. In the alternative scheme of analysis unseparated purified preparations of the virions were fully hydrolyzed with trypsin, and then the peptides were separated by ion exchange chromatography. In both schemes, the final stage was analysis of the peptides by LC MS/MS. The search for correspondence of the found masses to homologs from the database revealed that the virions, in addition to nine proteins encoded by the virus genome (HA, NA, NP, PB1, PB2, PA, M1, M2, and NS2), con tain 36 proteins of the host cell [5] .

Lipid rafts are structures from which many enveloped viruses are budded, as recently confirmed by MS analysis of the lipid composition of the influenza virus virions [16] and of HIV 1 [17] . On the other hand, such known raft markers as caveolin and flotillin were not a b detected either in the influenza virus virions [5] or in the HIV 1 particles [6, 17] . Further investigations are expect ed to distinguish \"accidental co travelers\" from cellular protein partners that are required during stages of virus entrance into the cell, assembly of daughter virions, or are involved in the replication/transcription of the genome. Some of these proteins might be promising targets for antiviral therapy.",

Trivalent seasonal vaccines include strains of two subtypes of influenza A virus, H1N1 and H3N2, and a strain of the type B influenza virus. Target peptides specific for viruses (A/H1, A/H3, and B) are labeled differently to provide for the mass shift in the spectrum relative to the peptide measured to be 10, 8, 7, or 6 units depending on the anti gen type/subtype. Every antigen concentration in the vaccine preparation is calculated by the ratio of heights of each pair of peaks. Another variety of the method can be used for determination not only of HA, but also of differ ent NAs in the seasonal vaccine [29] , and in the newest modification of the method all antigens are analyzed by MS upon preliminary immune affinity selection with a polyclonal antiserum immunocapture IDMS assay (IC IDMS) [30] .",

This is especially important if it is diffi cult to get information about the spatial structure using traditional approaches such as X ray crystallography or NMR. Thus, notwithstanding many attempts, the 3 D structure was determined only for the NM domain of matrix protein M1 of influenza virus, but not the full size molecule [50 52] . We found that during the removal with bromelain of HA from the surface of virions in the absence of a thiol reagent (subviral particles were then used for isolation of anchoring segments of HA that we will consider later) the inner matrix protein M1 was frag mented [53] . We supposed that on limited proteolysis the protein M1 regions oriented to the membrane should be hydrolyzed first. In fact, electron microscopic analysis of thin sections of preparations of subviral particles revealed local disruptions of the lipid bilayer [53] . On manually analyzing some minor peaks in the MALDI mass spectra, additionally to peaks of tryptic peptides we localized sev eral possible sites of M1 hydrolysis by bromelain. The main site was localized within the loop connecting the NM and C domains of the M1 molecule, whereas the other major sites were localized near one of the poles of the 3 D model of the protein globule, and we supposed that this pole should be turned to the virion membrane [54] .",

The viral particles were labeled, denatured, and the proteins were hydrolyzed enzymatically. Biotin labeled peptides were identified using affinity chromatography on avidin columns or by reversed phase HPLC MS/MS. Seven lysine residues bound with biotin were found in protein E2, whereas protein E1 had only one such site. The authors concluded that protein E1 was virtually com pletely hidden under protein E2.

            "text": "It was suggested earlier that a short cytoplasmic domain similar to that of HEF of influenza C virus (three amino acid residues, whereas influenza A and B viruses have 10 11 such residues) should act as a molecular signal for attaching stearate (instead of palmitate) [82] . Data of MS indicated that the lipid bilayer boundary could be a signal for stearate attachment. To confirm our hypothesis, we chose several glycoproteins from different groups of enveloped viruses that have different location of cysteine (the acylation site) relatively to the lipid bilayer boundary and that differ also in cytoplasmic domain length. We revealed by MS that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) gly coprotein G contains palmitate covalently bound to the cysteine residue located in the long (29 residues) cyto plasmic domain. In contrast, glycoprotein F of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and glycoprotein E1 of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) were stoichiometrically acylated with stearate residues [83] . In both stearoylated glycoproteins the conservative cysteine is located in the TM domain. However, SFV glycoprotein E1 contains a very short cyto plasmic domain consisting of two residues, and the NDV glycoprotein F contains a long cytoplasmic domain con sisting of 26 residues. Thus, not the length of the cyto plasmic domain but location of the acylation site relative to the lipid bilayer boundary seems to determine the choice of the modifying residue in different envelop gly coproteins. If viruses are acylated enzymatically similarly to cellular proteins [84, 85] , then different enzymes should exist that are responsible for attaching either palmitate or stearate.",

Each ectodomain monomer includes chain HA1 and (partially) chain HA2 containing a fusion peptide on the N terminus, whereas the C terminal region of chain HA2 is anchored to the viral membrane via the TM domain. At acidic pH values, the ectodomain of HA is subjected to pronounced rearrangements result ing in membrane fusion [86, 87] : the HA1 chains get sep arated as petals of a flower; the fusion peptide is incorpo rated into the target membrane; the trimer of central helices of the HA2 chain forms a hairpin tightening the target membrane to the virus membrane. This is not asso ciated with a rearrangement of the complex of TM domains; on the contrary, this complex supports the trimer integrity and creates tension required for produc tion of the fusion pore. But the structure of this complex is absolutely unknown. We proposed an alternative approach of extracting anchoring segments of HA for analysis by MS, and this has allowed us to obtain unique information about oligomerization of TM domains of HA.",

Different strains belonging to 14 of 16 known antigenic HA sub types of influenza A virus and also strains of influenza B virus have been analyzed [81] (Fig. 5a) . All varieties of HA of influenza A virus were hydrolyzed with bromelain in the linker region \"above\" the transmembrane domain, and both the TM domain and cytoplasmic domains remained intact, which suggests the preservation of the homotrimeric structure of HA. Hydrolysis of HA with the serine proteinase subtilisin Carlsberg in the case of sub BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 77 No. 8 2012 types from phylogenetic Group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14) also affected only the linker region. In contrast, all HA representatives from Group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H9 , H11, H12, H13, and H16) were cleaved with subtilisin in the TM domain. Because the differences we found in hydrolysis character could not be explained by specificity of enzymes, we proposed that the TM domains of HA from Group 2 should have tighter packing of homotrimers than Group 1 (Fig. 5b) .",
