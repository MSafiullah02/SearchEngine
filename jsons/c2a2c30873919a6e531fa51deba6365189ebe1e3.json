Nevertheless, the prevalence of coinfection differed significantly between the CRV and H1N1pdm infection groups, suggesting the bacterial positivity found in these cases could be clinically relevant. Moreover, Obasi et al. [2014] reported a significantly lower detection rate of bacteria in respiratory secretions from healthy adult than patients with acute respiratory infection. Second, only the results of molecular methods were analyzed. Thus, it is possible that bacterial and viral infections diagnosed on the basis of DNA and RNA detection overestimate the incidence of infection because it is often unfeasible to distinguish colonization from infection.
