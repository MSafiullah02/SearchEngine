Unlike the laboratory findings previously reported in the first and second cohorts,3\n,\n4 all blood biochemical and the other parameters determined in our cohort were not outside the normal range, although a couple of parameters, such as aspartate aminotransferase and albumin, demonstrated some an extent of fluctuation (Table 2). It was noted that COVID-19 pneumonia onset did not influence the proportion of lymphocytes subsets (Appendix Table 1) and the concentrations of immunoglobulins (Appendix Table 2). Reduced complement C3 could be seen in 57% of the infected HCWs at Day 1 and 29% at Day 7, while complement C4 was not affected (Appendix Table 2). We determined the concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, as well as IFN-\u03b3, and found that IL-6 was the only one cytokine whose level was significantly elevated in serum of COVID-19 pneumonia infected HCWs, indicating IL-6 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia (Appendix Table 3).",

Thus he was not suspected to be a COVID-19 patient. Eleven days after hospitalization, he accepted the pituitary adenoma resection and had a fever of 38 \u00b0C after the surgery. Postoperative fever was considered to the cause of the patient's fever. However, five days after the fever onset, the patient had a chest CT scan with typical signs of viral pneumonia. Meanwhile, another patient who lived in the same ward had fever, too. Further, several days later, the two patients were confirmed to be COVID-19 patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swab and transferred to isolation wards. However, during their stay in the department of neurosurgery, especially before the day of the first patient's chest CT scan, HCWs did not have enough personal protective equipment. Sometimes, they weared nursing mask but not the surgical mask, when they contact these two patient, as we did not know that was a COVID-19 patient at that time and the infectiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 was also underestimated. Moreover, HCWs also contacted each other in daily work and meetings, went to other departments in this hospital (where there were COVID-19 patients possibly), without wearing any masks. Among all the HCWs in this department, twelve nurses and two doctors had been identified to be COVID-19 infected HCWs. Besides exposure to the infected patients, exposure to the infected colleague maybe another important reason for the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs.",
