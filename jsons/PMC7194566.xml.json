By January 7th, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from patients in Wuhan (Wang et al., 2020). Following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) outbreak in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012, SARS-CoV-2 becomes the third coronavirus to emerge in the past two decades, which has put global public health institutions on high alert (Munster et al., 2020). Chan et al. (2020) carried out a study on a family of six patients, they noticed that one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected after contact with other family members. According to World Health Organization (2020), the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 include droplet transmission and contact transmission; airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed. So far, over eighty thousands of people have been diagnosed as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) all over China (Fig. 1\n). In the globe, the number of confirmed cases have exceeded 2.7 million, and the amount of confirmed cases is still climbing with the accumulated death over 187,000. In the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey, the number of confirmed cases have all exceeded 100 thousands as of April 25, 2020.",

Thus, it is necessary to appropriately disinfect and dispose of the hospital wastes and wastewater before being transported or discharged. Although domestic and foreign scholars have carried out a variety of studies focusing on the wastewater treatment, general waste disposal, hospital management, etc., the systematic studies concerning disinfection of hospital wastes and wastewaters, especially specific disinfection suggestions during COVID-19 pandemic, are rare to date. Therefore, the current review will concentrate on disinfection technologies for treatment of hospital wastes and wastewater, and provide suggestions for hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection during COVID-19 pandemic in China.",

The solubility of chlorine dioxide is five times that of chlorine and the oxidization capacity of chlorine dioxide is 2.63 times that of chlorine gas. It is generally recommended that the amount of chlorine dioxide used to treat hospital wastewater is 1/2.5 that of the available chlorine (NHC, 2002). The dosing system of chlorine dioxide for wastewater disinfection is consistent with the sodium hypochlorite disinfection technology, i.e. a double siphon automatic fixed-ratio dosing chlorine system is adopted for chlorine dioxide disinfection. When using a chlorine dioxide generator, the content of chlorine dioxide must be higher than 50%, and it should ensure safe operation and automatic addition of disinfectants with certain proportion (Wang et al., 2013). Chlorine dioxide could trigger the denaturation of enzyme and protein (Ogata, 2007). It destroys the anabolic pathways of protein and thus kills the microorganism, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, spores, and clostridium botulinum. The chlorine dioxide has the ability of decoloring, deodorization, oxidation, and increasing the oxygen content in wastewater. Due to its chemical structure, the chlorine is inconvenient to be stored or transported, though it still has advantages of lower costs of operation as well as preparation (Fan et al., 2017).",

Therefore, when using on-site prepared sodium hypochlorite for disinfection, a safe and reliable sodium hypochlorite generator with high electrical efficiency, low water consumption, low salt and electricity consumption, long operating life, and convenient operation should be employed. When raw salt is used as the raw material, the salt solution should be precipitated and filtered before being added to the sodium hypochlorite generator.

            "text": "Ozone is a disinfectant featured with high bactericidal effect, which has been widely used in water supply engineering and wastewater treatment (Chiang et al., 2003; Kist et al., 2013). The wastewater flows into the first-stage sedimentation tank, and then flows to the second-stage purification tank after purification. After proper treatment, it flows to the regulating storage tank. It is then pumped into the contact tower by the sewage pump, and fully exposed to approximately 15 mg/L-20 mg/L ozone in the tower for 10\u201315 min before being discharged. Generally, a hospital with 300 beds is suggested to build an ozone treatment system with a wastewater treatment capacity of 18 t/h to 20 t/h (NHC, 2002). Since the ozone disinfection has the capacity of decoloring and deodorizing, the wastewater after treatment becomes bright and transparent without odor. Also, the molecule structure of ozone is unstable, which implies that strong oxidative atomic oxygen produced by the decomposition of ozone molecule would quickly decompose microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, in wastewater. Although ozone disinfection could improve the water quality in shorter time with higher efficiency, the operation costs of ozone preparation are high (Arslan et al., 2017). Moreover, the by-products, which are produced through the chemical reaction with bromide and iodide, are hazardous to human health (Kleinb\u00f6hl et al., 2018). And over-dose of ozone is easy to cause bad smell and secondary pollution. Therefore, ozone disinfection is mainly suitable for smaller scale wastewater treatment system, especially wastewater treatment system with relatively high effluent quality.",

The UV was first used in disinfection of drinking water in 1910 (White et al., 1986). The UV could be divided into 4 wavebands based on different wavelength, including ultraviolet A (315 nm\u2013400 nm), ultraviolet B (280 nm\u2013315 nm), ultraviolet C (200 nm\u2013280 nm), and vacuum ultraviolet (100 nm\u2013200 nm). Thereinto, vacuum ultraviolet could not be used in disinfection because it is absorbed by the wastewater. The bands with wavelength between 200 nm and 300 nm could damage the structure of both DNA and RNA of the bacteria, viruses, and single-celled microorganisms and thus inhibit the protein synthesis. Therefore, the ultraviolet B and ultraviolet C have the best bactericidal effect. It is generally believed that the band with wavelength of 253.7 nm is optimal for ultraviolet disinfection (Meulemans, 1987). Compared with chlorine disinfection, the investment and operation costs of UV disinfection are significantly lower. However, disinfection with UVC is sometimes unsatisfactory since the depth of penetration is inadequate and there are occupational health risks (K\u00fchn et al., 2003).",

As a result, the emission of particulate matters is reduced, the residue is continuously discharged from the end of the hearth, and the flammable gas is sent to the secondary combustion chamber.

Microwave frequencies used for disinfection are generally (2,450 \u00b1 50) MHz and (915 \u00b1 25) MHz (Neto et al., 1999). The microwave passes through the medium and is absorbed by the medium to generate heat. The heat is generated by the substance molecules vibrating and rubbing for billions of times per second, thereby achieving the effect of high temperature disinfection. The microwave disinfection technology is characterized with energy saving, low action temperature, slow heat loss, rapid action, light damage, and low environmental pollution with no residues or toxic wastes after disinfection (Ohtsu et al., 2011). It has a wide disinfection spectrum of bacteria, which can kill various microorganisms. Regarding the ability to destroy pathogens, there is now convincing evidence that specially constructed microwave systems are able to sufficiently inactivate microorganisms; however, the process has to be strictly controlled by special microwave devices. Conventional microwave units have no means to control the inactivation process and the moisture content. Though a few sophisticated microwave technologies with appropriate measurements are currently only used for the treatment of biohazardous wastes, it needs to be evaluated whether they would also have advantages for processes involving the control of water content such as the drying of biotherapeutic products (Walters et al., 2014).",

Ong et al. (2020) believed that transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person. Based on previous studies concerning the pathogen transmission in wastewater system, Gormley et al. (2020) claimed that under some circumstances, the wastewater system has the potential to enable airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These are consistent with the fact in a study that SARS-CoV-2 from a single stool specimen has been cultured (Zhang et al., 2020). It is also reported that wastewater discharged from a COVID-19 designated hospital was SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive, indicating that the virus might contaminate the drainage system (China Citywater, 2020). In addition, the disinfection of hospital wastes is also in high necessity since the waste generation increases exponentially during this period, which may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk on both medical staffs and patients without proper collection and disinfection (Yu et al., 2020).",

(2020) reported that the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 strains are phylogenetically closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses, and the Spike protein has a 78% nucleotide identity with the human SARS-CoV-1. Due to the similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 might also be sensitive to either environment factors or disinfectants. Therefore, disinfection technologies adopted during SARS epidemic could be used as good reference to inactivation of SARS-Cov-2 in hospital wastes and wastewater. SARS-CoV-1 could exist for 2 days, 3 days, and 17 days in the hospital wastewater, stool, and urine at 20 \u00b0C, respectively (Wang et al., 2005). All SARS viruses could be inactivated in 30 min at 20 \u00b0C with more than 0.5 mg/L residual free chlorine or 2.19 mg/L residual chlorine dioxide left (Chen et al., 2006). Chen et al. (2006) compared disinfection performance of different technologies and reported that chlorine and UV irradiation were the most efficient followed by chlorine dioxide, though efficiency of ozone disinfection was not ideal. This result was in line with findings reported by Wang et al. (2005).",

In Wuhan, local MEE has established an emergency scheme for disposal of wastewater from temporary treatment centers, which are newly built COVID-19 designated hospital for cases with mild symptoms in Wuhan, China. Chlorine disinfection (liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite), which has long been used in hospital wastewater disinfection in China, is adopted in this scheme. The available chlorine is recommended to be approximately 50 mg/L. For disinfection septic tank, the contact duration should be longer than 1.5 h with residual chlorine over 6.5 mg/L and fecal coliform colonies less than 100 per liter. In addition, UV irradiation and heating are also suggested for wastewater disinfection in other COVID-19 designated hospitals because of fewer by-products and ideal disinfection performance. The water quality of wastewater discharged from the hospital should meet requirements below (Table 4\n). Moreover, the infectious wastes should also be collected in time under protective conditions. They are suggested to be disinfected using solid or liquid chlorine containing disinfectants with available chlorine concentration of 20 g/L and disinfection duration of 2 h. Pharmaceutical wastes and chemical wastes are suggested to be incinerated. Radioactive wastes contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 are suggested to be disinfected as infectious wastes after storing for at least 10 half-lives and. Disposable protection products should also be treated as infectious wastes. For example, respirators should be soaked in 75% alcohol for 30 min. Moreover, chlorine disinfectants with 500 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L are suggested for disinfection of other protection products without or with obvious contamination, respectively. The disinfection performance of hospital wastes should meet requirements below.",

Without disinfection, they should not be allowed to be arbitrarily discharged or used as agricultural fertilizer. The use of any infiltration wells/pits to discharge wastewater and sludge, or the discharge into sanitary protection zone of drinking water sources should also be strictly forbidden. In addition, government should take measures to improve the management of hospital wastes and wastewater, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospital should set up a recycling system and assign special personnel to take charge, and strengthen the management of each department to prevent waste loss. Personnel involved in the disposal of disposable medical supplies must be qualified and strengthened in personal protection. In recent years, many new advances have also been made in hospital wastes and wastewater treatment technologies, such as radiation disinfection technology, reverse polymerization disinfection technology, plasma disinfection technology, and thermal gasification disinfection technology. They have certain promotion value, but due to the high investment costs, these technologies have not been used at a large scale. With the improvement of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection technologies, the costs of disinfection will continue to decrease, and secondary pollution to the environment will be gradually controlled. During the disinfection, the environmental pollution or effects on human health could be significantly reduced if the operation strictly obeys the requirements. In order to develop more secure, efficient, economical disinfection methods, local environment and actual conditions should be brought into consideration in future studies.",
