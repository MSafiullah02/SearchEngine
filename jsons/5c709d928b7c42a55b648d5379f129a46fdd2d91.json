It has structural similarity to tenovofir. This compound was later found to have activity against Ebola virus in animal models [37] , but failed in clinical trials [38] . Remdesivir has been used in more than 500 patients for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Liver toxicity was not reported, but this is difficult to rule out, given the frequent occurrence of abnormal liver enzymes at baseline as a feature of EBD. Robust in silico, in vitro and animal models data support the anti-viral activity of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses [39] [40] [41] [42] . A recent report of compassionate use of remdesivir for COVID-19 showed promising effectivity (68% clinical improvement and 18% mortality in severe patients) [43] . This report was not controlled and excluded patients with ALT or AST > 5 times the upper limit of normal. In the 53 analyzed patients, 23% patients had increased liver enzymes, leading to remdesivir discontinuation in 2 patients. No report of bilirubin elevation was mentioned. Remdesivir is an intravenous drug and currently 5-and 10-day treatment duration are being explored. No hepatic or renal adjustments are recommended, but in trials it has been used mainly with creatinine clearance >30 mL/min. The cyano group in the remdesivir molecule provides specificity of action, avoiding inhibition of host mitochondrial DNA polymerase, thus reducing the potential for lactic acidosis or mitochondrial toxicity. There are at least 6 ongoing clinical trials of remdesivir for COVID-19 with several thousands of patients enrolled, all excluding patients with ALT or AST >5 times the upper limit of normal. Based on current experience of other nucleoside/nucleotide analogs in patients with cirrhosis it may be anticipated a better safety profile compared to other drug classes. It has been suggested to control liver enzymes daily if remdesivir is used [44] . No relevant drugdrug interactions are predicted for this compound. Remdesivir is likely to be the first approved anti-viral treatment for SARS-CoV-2, so -if approved -it will require collecting real world experience in registries especially when used in a more diverse population, specifically in patients with liver disease or abnormal baseline liver enzymes and patients receiving other medications to reveal any important drug interaction.",
