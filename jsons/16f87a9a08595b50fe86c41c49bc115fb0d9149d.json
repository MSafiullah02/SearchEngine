            "text": "We describe, with this report, the shocking effect of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak on the Department of Neurosurgery of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, which represents at the moment, the most affected city in the entire Italian territory (Figure 1 ). 1 This epidemic is challenging the Italian Government and the Healthcare System and is having a devastating impact on all the health activities, without excluding the neurosurgical reality. The first known contagion from SARS-CoV-2, causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 , was reported on February 21, in the small town of Codogno, in Lombardy. On the same day, the fist death from COVID-19 happened in Padua, and the second occurred on February 22 in Lombardy. 2 The consequent infection chain led the Italian Council of Ministers to publish a decree prohibiting the transit in and out of the outbreak areas (the so-called red areas), suspending all the public events, and introducing the quarantine for all the infected citizens, (Figure 2A ). The first cases in Bergamo were identified on February 23. Since then, the virus spread exponentially in Northern Italy, and afterwards throughout the state. Lombard hospitals were gradually overcrowded by patients with COVID-19. 3 On March 8, in an attempt to contain the epidemic, a decree of the Italian Prime Minister extended the red areas to the entire Lombardy and to other 14 Italian provinces ( Figure 2B ). This act was implemented the day after, when the whole of Italy became a red area ( Figure  2C ); 4 this was globally launched by the Government itself even in social networks, with the hashtag #iorestoacasa (#istayhome). In so doing, the movement of people throughout the country was reduced, all sports events were suspended, and teaching activities in schools and universities were stopped until April 3. By March 11, only basic shops were left open. Up to today (March 20), the total SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are 47.021, making Italy the second state with the most confirmed infections, after China. Italian death toll had recently surpassed China, becoming the country with the highest COVID-19-related mortality worldwide. 5 Bergamo is currently the most plagued Italian city and Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital is the largest health care center in the city. It comprises 1,080 beds, 83 of which are in critical care beds (53 of Intensive and 30 Subintensive Care beds). It is designed with a central area (which includes laboratories, diagnostic services, the Emergency Department, 32 operating rooms) and 7 towers all around it, each of which harbors different medical specialties. It also includes a 24-hour heliport and 280 outpatient clinics. The Hospital is home to one of the six highly specialized Trauma Centers identified by the Lombard Trauma Management Network in 2012. Moreover, it is the only Pediatric Trauma Center in the Region. The Department of Neurosurgery is one of the Hospital flagships. The neurosurgical catchment area covers nearly 1.200.000 citizens. Ten attending neurosurgeons and three residents work in the Department. There is a neurosurgeon on call 24-hours-a-day. Neurosurgical Ward includes 34 beds and another 16 beds in the dedicated Neurointensive care unit. Two operating theaters, offering 17 weekly surgical interventions, are available. In 2019, we completed 1360 surgical procedures (305 major cranial, 285 minor cranial, 191 major spinal, 483 minor spinal), including 260 urgencies, 70 pediatric procedures, and 3.630 outpatient visits were performed. 6 This solid infrastructure underwent important changes in the last two months, in accordance with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic Since the last days of February, there was a massive increase of COVID-19 cases in Bergamo, and a large number of patients overloaded the Emergency Room. Initially, they were kept in the Emergency Department or admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases. When the situation worsened further, it was necessary to activate supplementary emergency responses, which resulted in a profound reorganization of all sectors, including Neurosurgery. Many wards were closed and many other were reconverted to COVID-facilities, according to the Hospital Health Direction. On February 24, all hospitalizations for elective surgical procedures were stopped. On March 6, the Gastroenterology Department was converted to a \"Gastro-COVID\" unit; after two days the \"Pneumo-COVID\" was created, and on March 10 the Department of Neurology became the \"Neuro-COVID\". Lastly, the Department of Hematology was transformed into the \"Hemato-COVID\" on March 17. New intensive care areas were created, taking mechanical ventilators from the dismissed operating rooms. Inside the so-called \"COVID-Towers\", 400 total beds have been established for COVID-19 patients, and 92 additional beds in the Intensive Care Units. All units are currently saturated. Four intensive positions are available for cardiac emergencies or pediatric trauma. In the Emergency Department, 42 beds are at disposal, and 4 others advanced stations are located in the Shock Room. In order to streamline the constant flow of people, the triage system was extended even in the parking space. The actual number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients stands to 538 (442 in hospital ward and 96 in intensive care units), which represent the 49.8% of the Hospital total capacity. At the moment, it is not possible to increase this quantity for the lack of workers, and the critical issues associated with COVID-19 infected hospital staff. Moreover, there exists a significant deficiency of personal protective equipment, medications (i.e. antiviral drugs, antibiotics), medical devices and even oxygen. The opening of these special areas required the recruitment of medical and nursing staff (even without specific skills) in treating pulmonary or infectious diseases, taken from both local medical and surgical Departments. 7 On March 6, 25% of the neurosurgical staff was assigned to COVID-towers; this percentage arose to 50% on March 13, and to 75% since March 20. This deficit was accompanied by a concomitant overall reduction of neurosurgical activities. Hospitalized patients were gradually discharged, and the Department of Neurosurgery was closed on March 12. On call duty 24/7 was also terminated, and our last patients were moved to a new temporary Ward of ten beds, in common with orthopedic surgeons and otolaryngologists. Outpatient visits were unaffected until March 6, at which time they were reduced to a weekly session for urgencies and another one for cerebral and spinal oncological cases. Surgical activity was regular with 17 intervention per week until March 1, when seven slots were withdrawn, and only ten surgical procedures were allowed. In the week from 9 to 15 March, only four urgent operations were performed; and following 15 March, no procedures were performed. In order to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the Regional Health System adopted different urgent containment measures. 8 On March 8, with the Decree XI/2906, 9 the Lombard Health System was reorganized and the regional neurosurgical network was concentrated in 4 Hub Hospitals: three of them for cranial or spinal emergencies, and a fourth specialized for oncological pathologies (Figure 3) . Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital remained the reference point for pediatric trauma, while all the other Lombard Departments of Neurosurgery became the Spoke of a Spoke and Hub system. In this way, Hub Hospitals were free to deal with specific medical or surgical emergencies, while Spoke Hospitals focused on COVID-19 patients. Even if in Italy the national Health Care System is mainly public, Research Hospitals and accredited private Hospitals were included in this network. As of today, no pediatric traumatic emergencies were sent to our Institution. This is significatively below the expectations, 9 and likely has resulted from legitimate curfew instituted by the government to limit contagious spread of the virus, with the unexpected advantage associated with a reduced risk of traumatic injuries. The true efficacy of this system still needs to be clarified when further data, when such becomes available. The recent literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spreading is still expected to propagate exponentially. 10 Therefore, the readiness of foreign Health Systems will continue to be challenged worldwide. The Italian experience has demonstrated the priceless contribution of neurosurgeons and other not-specialized physicians dealing with COVID-19, where all the available resources are needed. The world is fighting a battle with an invisible common enemy, which must be won.",
