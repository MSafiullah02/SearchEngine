Estimates suggest that about 34 million new cases of lower respiratory infection due to respiratory syncytial virus occur globally in children younger than 5 years, with 3\u00b74 million admissions to hospitals and about 199 000 deaths per year, predominantly in the developing world.2 In developed countries such as the USA, bronchiolitis is the most common reason for admission to hospital in the first 12 months of life,3 accounting for approximately 100 000 infant admissions annually. Although admissions to hospital have declined from 2000 to 2010, emergency department visits have increased, in addition to increased use of mechanical ventilation and hospital charges.4, 5\n",

Although the peak and duration of these epidemics vary worldwide, they are consistent year-to-year within a country.7 Some data suggest that climate might also be associated with prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus infection, with global surveillance suggesting that infection peaks during wet months in areas with high precipitation and during cooler months in hot regions.7 Indoor crowding in population-dense areas during rainy seasons or cooler months might be one factor that facilitates viral transmission.8 Additionally, weather-related factors, such as inhalation of cold and dry air that might impair ciliary function, the airway mucosa, and inhibition of temperature-dependent antiviral responses, might influence both disease transmission and severity.9, 10\n",

Timing of symptom progression can vary, and young infants can present with apnoea. Lower respiratory tract symptoms of bronchiolitis include persistent cough, tachypnoea, and increased work of breathing, as shown by intercostal or supraclavicular retractions, use of abdominal muscles, grunting, or nasal flaring. Auscultatory findings include crackles and wheeze. A hallmark characteristic of bronchiolitis is the minute-to-minute variation in clinical findings, as mucus and debris in the airways are cleared by coughing or as the child's state changes from sleep to agitation. This variation can confound assessment, and often requires several examinations over a period of observation. Nasal congestion can also confound the clinical assessment. Nasal suctioning might help to ascertain which findings are truly from the lower airways. Fever can be present in about a third of infants with bronchiolitis, but it is usually present early in the illness with a temperature less than 39\u00b0C.38 The median duration of symptoms is about 2 weeks, with 10\u201320% of infants still having symptoms at 3 weeks after onset.38, 41 Various clinical scores have been shown in studies and clinical protocols to correlate with disease severity and improvement.42, 43 Although documentation of a score can be useful as an objective measure, individual scores are not highly predictive, and they should be repeated and combined with other measures of severity for a universal assessment to guide decision making.",

These outcomes represent only part of the morbidity of bronchiolitis, but developing evidence suggests that intermittent hypoxaemia might occur commonly in otherwise stable infants with bronchiolitis and raises questions as to whether this factor should be used as a sole indication for admission to hospitals. A Canadian randomised trial found reduced admissions to hospital from the emergency department without any increase in revisits when pulse oximeters displayed values 3% higher than the actual value, suggesting that arbitrary pulse oximetry thresholds result in unnecessary admissions.51 A similar trial in the UK in the hospital setting found that reduction of the oxygen threshold from 94% to 90% resulted in earlier discharge from the hospital without any evidence of adverse outcomes.52 A US trial comparing intermittent versus continuous pulse oximetry in non-hypoxaemic infants in hospitals found similar outcomes between the groups.53 This US trial and other evidence supports recommendations in US practice guidelines that clinicians use a threshold of 90% for initiation of oxygen, whereas UK guidelines recommend 92%.38, 39 As the child improves, reduction in intensity of monitoring to intermittent checks is appropriate. A recent study using blinded oximetry at home showed that a substantial proportion of infants with bronchiolitis who are otherwise doing well have oxygen desaturations less than 90%, particularly during sleep, further calling into question arbitrary thresholds for hospital admissions and initiation of oxygen.54 This evidence will probably lead to efforts to reduce continuous monitoring in children without other indications for monitoring.",

Virological testing, however, does not generally assist in management and is insufficient to predict outcomes.30, 63 Many national guidelines therefore recommend against routine virological testing in bronchiolitis (table). Recent studies suggest that higher respiratory syncytial virus genomic load, measured using quantitative PCR, might be associated with increased length of stay, use of respiratory support, and need for intensive care, in addition to recurrent wheezing, compared with lower viral loads.28, 31, 32, 64 Further study is warranted to confirm this association and clarify whether viral load measurement improves understanding of disease pathophysiology and severity. Several guidelines recommend using respiratory syncytial virus testing to guide cohorting of patients; however, the viruses most likely to cause bronchiolitis are all transmitted in a similar fashion (close contact with large-particle aerosols or direct contact with contaminated fomites).65, 66, 67 Thus, infection control might not be dependent on the identification of specific viruses, but rather on following strict precautions including hand hygiene, separating infants in shared hospital rooms by more than 1 m, and other infection control procedures.65 Additionally, given the sensitivity of PCR testing, results should be interpreted with caution. Certain viruses, such as rhinovirus, might be detected because of viral shedding from an unrelated illness or colonisation; whereas certain other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus, are almost always associated with an acute infection.",

Therefore, the theoretical benefits of hypertonic saline seen in cystic fibrosis might not be present in infants with acute viral bronchiolitis. Although initial trials demonstrated some ability of hypertonic saline to decrease hospital length of stay and transiently improve clinical severity score,81, 82, 83 more recent trials demonstrated conflicting results.84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90 The trials that showed the largest benefit were done in hospitals with lengths of stay more than 72 h; thus, hypertonic saline for infants in countries and institutions in which the length of stay approaches or exceeds 72 h might be beneficial at reducing length of stay. The conflicting results are reflected in the differences in recommendations across national guidelines (table), with some countries not recommending hypertonic saline, some recommending use for all inpatients, and some recommending use only in moderate to severe illness.",

In seven trials, hypertonic saline reduced the risk of admission to hospital by 20% (risk ratio 0\u00b78; 95% CI 0\u00b767\u20130\u00b796) compared with 0\u00b79% saline. No substantial adverse effects of hypertonic saline were noted in this systematic review. Although the results of this meta-analysis were significant, attention should be paid to the outer limits of the confidence intervals, which approach no difference, and to the clinical relevance of these differences. A second 2015 meta-analysis of 15 trials and 1922 patients found a smaller, but significant, decrease in length of stay by \u22120\u00b736 days (95% CI \u22120\u00b75 to \u22120\u00b722; p<0\u00b7001) in those who received hypertonic saline (figure 3\n).92 This study found a discrepancy between the overall combined effect of all studies on length of stay and the negative results from the largest trials, allowing the authors to conclude that neither individual trials nor pooled estimates provide a strong evidence-based foundation for the use of hypertonic saline. Both meta-analyses showed substantial heterogeneity across studies (I\n2=82\u00b71%, p<0\u00b7001;91 and I\n2=77\u00b78%, p=0\u00b702992). A recent reanalysis of the first 2015 meta-analysis removed two outlying Chinese studies and accounted for imbalances in day of illness at presentation.93 These analyses resolved the heterogeneity and found that hypertonic saline does not reduce length of stay in infants admitted to hospitals with bronchiolitis (mean difference in length of stay removing outliers \u22120\u00b721 days; 95% CI \u22120\u00b743 to 0\u00b702; mean difference in length of stay accounting for day of illness imbalance 0\u00b702 days; 95% CI \u22120\u00b714 to 0\u00b717). Large trials have not demonstrated benefit for hypertonic saline and this meta-analysis found no effect of hypertonic saline on length of stay after adjustment for outliers and imbalances. The decision to undertake future trials is controversial given the positive results of some meta-analyses and negative results of others.",

Data from two large multicentre trials have shown no benefit to corticosteroids alone in reducing admissions to hospital,94, 95 and a 2013 Cochrane Collaboration review supports the results of these studies.96 This review included only studies that enrolled children younger than 24 months with a first episode of wheezing and signs of a viral illness. Among the included eight outpatient studies (1824 participants) comparing corticosteroids with placebo there was no reduction in admission at day 1 (Z=1\u00b705; p=0\u00b73) or day 7 (Z=1\u00b738; p=0\u00b717) after enrolment (figure 4\n), clinical scores, length of stay in the emergency department, or length of time to resolution of symptoms. Among the nine inpatient studies (772 participants), length of hospital stay was not reduced.96 On the basis of this evidence, multiple clinical practice guidelines recommend against the use of corticosteroids for infants with bronchiolitis (table). Although clinicians report considering a family or personal history of atopy when deciding whether to treat infants with bronchiolitis with corticosteroids,41 there is no evidence that such infants receive any benefit from corticosteroid treatment.94, 95, 96 Evidence for the presence or absence of respiratory syncytial virus infection in these infants being associated with a response to corticosteroids is also unavailable.94, 95 Authors from a large study with a factorial design have suggested, in an unadjusted analysis, that high-dose corticosteroids in combination with nebulised epinephrine might reduce admissions for outpatients with bronchiolitis by day 7,95 but these results are considered exploratory.39, 45\n",

Evidence for efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula is predominantly observational, with studies documenting improved respiratory parameters and reduced intubation rates after implementation.97 One small randomised trial compared high-flow nasal cannula with hypertonic saline and found no difference in change in respiratory score.98 Concerns about high-flow nasal cannula include the potential for rapid deterioration if the infant is not closely monitored and costs associated with overuse.",

This trial also found that a nasogastric tube might be easier to place than an intravenous line in these infants.107 Most guidelines recommend either nasogastric or intravenous fluids to maintain hydration, with the UK and Scottish guidelines preferring nasogastric or orogastric hydration in those that can tolerate it compared with intravenous hydration (table).

The insufficient available evidence includes a retrospective cohort study of 740 infants108 and a small observational study of 40 infants.109 These studies suggest that deep suctioning might increase length of stay for inpatients,108 infrequent suctioning is associated with an increased length of stay,108 and oxygen saturation might increase after suctioning.109 To draw conclusions about causality from these observational studies is difficult, because the potential for confouding by indication exists (eg, sicker children might be more likely to receive deep suctioning).

Studies report that 17\u201360% of children with bronchiolitis might develop recurrent wheezing in the years following their initial admission to hospital. A large study from Taiwan that followed up 1981 children admitted with bronchiolitis before age 3 years found that by age 10 years, 351 (17\u00b77%) of 1981 children with bronchiolitis had a diagnosis of asthma compared with 2159 (11\u00b77%) of 18 527 controls (hazard ratio 1\u00b758; 95% CI 1\u00b741\u20131\u00b771).118 One small cohort study of 138 patients has suggested that 18 (39%) of 46 children admitted with bronchiolitis before 12 months have asthma by 18 years compared with eight (9%) of 92 controls.115 However, another study that followed a birth cohort of 1246 children found that although lower respiratory tract infection in childhood was associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing, this association decreased with age and was not significant by age 13 years.116 Most children in this cohort had mild illness not requiring hospital admission, and severity of illness might be associated with the increased risk of asthma.119 The question remains whether respiratory infection at a young age itself predisposes children to asthma through damage or alteration of lung function, or whether children with severe bronchiolitis might have individual risk factors (such as altered immune response or airway function) that predisposes them to both severe bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing.8\n",

A large outpatient multicentre study could clarify whether there is any benefit.",
