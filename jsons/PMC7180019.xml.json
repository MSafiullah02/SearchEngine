Additionally, their contribution breaks down health spending for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, healthy lives and wellbeing, and for pandemic preparedness. They note that since the development and implementation of the SDG agenda in 2015, health spending has increased. Spending on SDG3 has also increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting targets has been mixed.",

Furthermore, the long-term projections of health spending to 2030 and 2050 provided here1 contribute a useful overview of global and regional developments in health expenditure. We believe that more can be done to increase policy relevance and contextual understanding of data such as those presented\u2014eg, by going into more depth regarding trends in current and future global health spending. An improved understanding of these trends is valuable for policy making and useful for stakeholder groups engaged in following up governments' commitment to health.",

We would go even further and argue that current trends show that improved domestic resource mobilisation will be the only way for these countries to mobilise the resources needed for SDG3. The present Article and previous publications from the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network clearly indicate the diminishing importance of development assistance for health (DAH) for financing services at the country level, even for disease areas commonly perceived as highly dependent on DAH.1, 3, 4 The projections to 2030 indicate that DAH will continue to be important in some low-income countries at the end of the SDG period, but this finding is more a consequence of the lack of growth in domestic spending than an effect of increasing DAH.",

Furthermore, global commitment to achieving universal health coverage6 requires a gradual move from siloed funding for specific diseases, earmarking of funds, and limitations on what DAH can be spent on (eg, many development partners are still reluctant to finance salaries). Instead DAH, like governments' own health spending, should be allocated to a broad set of interventions addressing the most common health needs of the population. Resource allocation would typically be defined in a country's essential health-care package, and we argue that such country-owned packages should be the centrepiece to determine how resources, including DAH, should be allocated. While countries' efforts towards universal health coverage are increasingly formalised, future analyses from the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network could hopefully also track progress towards this goal.",

The authors also acknowledge this aspect as a limitation of their study. Consequently, the Article does not take a health systems approach to the data. Instead, aggregated data on health spending are reported followed by spending in disease categories or, in the case of universal health coverage, covering several diseases. For decision makers in a ministry of health, this way of dividing the funds is not particularly helpful because budgeting systems are commonly constructed on the basis of entities that cut across the health system by expenditure categories (eg, staff costs, medical equipment, rent, pharmaceuticals) and not on disease categories. Further work should seek to develop formats for resource requirements that are aligned with standard government budgeting and we look forward to following the authors work in developing such methods.",
