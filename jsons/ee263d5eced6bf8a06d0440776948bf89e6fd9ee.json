            "text": "The microneutralization (MN) assay is a standard and important technique in virology, immunology, and epidemiology. It is a highly specific and sensitive assay for evaluating virus-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in human and animal sera. It provides the most precise answer to whether or not an individual or animal has antibodies that can neutralize or inhibit the infectivity of a specific virus strain. However, using live virus-based MN assay might require working under high containment facilities especially when dealing with high-risk pathogens such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In this chapter, we describe the isolation, amplification, and titration of MERS-CoV, as well as detailed MN assay to measure nAb levels in sera from different mammalian species.",

            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic \u03b2-coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that dromedary camels are the main zoonotic source of MERS-CoV [2, 3] . MERS-CoV causes a wide range of manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infections to mild or severe respiratory disease. Detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies (Abs) in humans and/or animals represents a valuable tool in diagnostics as well as epidemiological, virological, and immunological studies including evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Several serological assays have been developed and used for MERS-CoV, including ELISAbased assays, immunofluorescence assays, protein microarrays, and pseudovirus-based neutralization assays [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, most of these assays pose several drawbacks and limitations such as low specificity and sensitivity, need for expensive and special equipment and reagents, and/or highly trained technical staff, which could limit their use.",

The assay has several advantages in detecting nAbs against MERS-CoV. It can precisely detect virus-specific nAbs in human and animal sera without the need for specific reagents or equipment, it can be carried out readily once the virus is isolated, and it can overcome strain-specific antigenic changes. The protocol presented in this chapter consists of four major steps, including MERS-CoV isolation, amplification, titration, and neutralization. The MN assay described here is suitable to quantitatively measure the titer of nAbs in sera from different mammalian species. ",
