My mother, sister and her family members, brother (also an obstetrician-gynecologist) and his wife, as well as some of my best friends live in Italy. I understood from them and Italian news, loud and clear, how bad COVID-19 was for humans, and for pregnant women, early on.",

A US registry has started (https://priority.ucsf.edu/), which will soon provide information about the management and outcomes on hundreds of pregnant women in the United States with COVID-19. There is no need to panic. I feel this is what we\u2019ll talk about with our grandchildren, like my grandfather and father (I miss him!) talked to me about the World War-II and the Americans coming to save Italy. Help is coming this time too, guidance will continue to evolve, and AJOG MFM is glad to be in a position to offer some of this precious assistance.",
