Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and specific assay and therefore preferred (2, 3) .

The coronavirus structural proteins, including the envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) proteins, are expressed via the production of subgenomic messenger RNAs, which during certain stages of the replication cycle far outnumber (anti)genomic RNAs. The ORF1ab/RdRp, E, N, and S genes are the targets most frequently used for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR. For example, the \"Corman\" PCR, which was co-developed in our lab and is now routinely used for our in-house diagnostic work, targets a combination of the E-gene and the RdRpgene (2) . In this set-up, the E-gene primer/probe set is specific for bat(-related) betacoronaviruses, and therefore detects both SARS-CoV-1 and -2. In addition, whereas the RdRp-gene primers are also specific for bat(-related) betacoronaviruses, two probes are used: one specific for bat (-related) betacoronaviruses and another specific for SARS-CoV-2. In this study we only used the RdRp probe that is specific for SARS-CoV-2.",

Most of the selected kits are CE-IVD certified and can be produced in large quantities. Using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 RNA we determine the 95% limit of detection (LOD95%) for each of these assays. In addition, a concise panel of clinical samples (n=22) was run to provide a first indication of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Although some kits appeared to perform better than others at identifying clinical samples at very low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, all tests were able to identify positive samples with Ct\u226434.5 in our in-house E-gene PCR. Therefore, we conclude that all of the RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.",

Promising commercial kits were selected based on: 1) listing on the FindDx website; 2) responsiveness to requests; 3) accessible information (in English); 4) compatibility with different PCR platforms; 5) considerable production capacity. Notably, all of the PCR kits that we had selected for our analysis have in the meantime also been selected for the first round of independent evaluation by FIND (www.finddx.org/covid-19/sarscov2-eval-molecular/, April 2020). All of the kits included in our analysis were provided free of charge and none of the manufacturers were involved in the assessment and interpretation of the results. The selection encompasses both kits that require transport and storage at -20\u00b0C and kits that can be transported and stored at room temperature. Target genes for each RT-PCR kit were available in the assay documentation or upon request (for an overview, see Table 1 ). All PCRs J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f were run on a LightCycler 480 II (LC480II, Roche) and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for use.

The 10-fold dilution series provided a first indication of the LOD95% for each assay and were used to determine the starting point of a 2-fold dilution series performed with four replicates to come to a more precise estimate (for Ct values, see supplementary Table S2 ). Probit analysis was performed to estimate the LOD95%, which is shown in Table 2 . Notably, due to the limited extent of the dilution series, this analysis did not always provide upper and lower bounds of the estimate and should not be considered definitive. We found that the estimated LOD95% for the various targets of the RT-PCR kits varied within a 6-fold range, with the RT-PCR kit from Altona Diagnostics having the lowest LOD95% at 3.8 copies/ml for both the E-and S-gene assays and the PrimerDesign kit having the highest LOD95% at 23 copies/ml (Table 2) . Overall, our in-house \"Corman\" RT-PCR had the lowest estimated LOD95% at 0.91 copies/ml for the E-gene assay (2) .",

In addition, we included a panel of clinical samples (n=6) with other confirmed respiratory viral infections, including influenza virus type A, RSV A and B, and rhinovirus. Notably, the new RNA J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f isolation performed on stored clinical samples resulted in increased Ct values (by approximately 1 Ct) compared to the initial diagnostic results for our in-house E-gene PCR. The positive identification rate for the various RT-PCR kits varied from 10 to 13 out of 13 samples (Figure 2A), with R-Biopharm AG performing best (13/13), followed by BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene (12/13), CerTest BioTec (11/13), and Altona Diagnostics and PrimerDesign (10/13). Of note, Seegene had one \"inconclusive\" sample according to the manufacturer's instructions for interpretation, which might have tested positive upon re-testing but has now been counted as \"negative\". All target gene assays were able to positively identify the 10 clinical samples with the highest concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 (Ct\u226434.50 in our inhouse E-gene PCR). For these samples, the different assays showed a similar pattern of Ct values, on average ranging from almost 1 Ct lower (Altona Diagnostics S-gene) to almost 5 Ct higher (KH Medical S-gene) than those obtained with the in-house E-gene PCR (Figure 2B). None of the assays showed cross-reactivity with circulating respiratory (corona)viruses. Importantly, none of the assays resulted in a positive signal for any of the clinical samples with confirmed noncoronavirus respiratory viral infections (SupplementaryTable S1). We also ran a panel consisting of cell culture-derived viral RNA for related human coronaviruses (SARS1, MERS, NL63, OC43, and 229E) to check for cross-reactivity within the coronavirus family. Of these, only the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene was identified, as per design, by assays from Altona Diagnostics, Seegene, and our in-house PCR (Supplementary",

The actual copy number J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f for each RT-PCR target and accompanying limit of detection may vary depending on, for example, the amount of subgenomic messenger RNA-containing cells that are present in the (clinical) sample. From a selection of clinical samples with various concentrations of viral RNA (n=13), all RT-PCR kits were able to positively identify the ten samples with the highest concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct\u226434.5 in our in-house E-gene PCR). To provide an indication on clinical relevance of this finding: from our in-house diagnostic data on patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms, it appears that from all individuals testing positive for our in-house E-gene PCR (n=416) the proportion of individuals with a Ct value >34.5 is approximately 3.6% (unpublished data). The R-Biopharm AG kit positively identified the highest number of clinical samples, i.e. 13 out of 13, comparable with our in-house PCR.Three kits were able to positively identify 12 out of 13 samples (BGI, KH Medical, Seegene). Notably, we performed our analysis using only a small number of clinical samples and we therefore advise that diagnostic laboratories in the field conduct additional and more extensive in-house clinical validations upon implementation of novel RT-PCR kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity towards a panel of other respiratory (corona)viruses, except for the expected cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. Since the latter virus is no longer known to be circulating in the human population, we consider this cross-reactivity acceptable.Considering our findings, we believe that all of the commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine diagnostics of symptomatic COVID-19 patients. When performing virus diagnostics in populations that may be expected to display low viral loads, such as health-care workers with mild or no symptoms or patients during later stages of the infection(6), it might be advisable to use those kits that performed best regarding the positive identification of clinical samples, i.e. RT-PCR kits from R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene.",

Next, we ran four replicates of a 2-fold dilution series (diluted in yeast carrier RNA in water) to determine the LOD95% by Probit analysis using SPSS Statistics (IBM, version 24). The limited range of the dilution series did not allow for determination of a confidence interval for the LOD95% for all assays, which should therefore be regarded as an approximation and not considered definitive. The starting concentration of the viral RNA (copies/ml) was determined by digital PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-gene and was specific for the positive sense genomic RNA (2).Finally, a panel of clinical samples with in-house confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (17.25\u2264Ct\u226434.0 for the E-gene during initial diagnostics; n=13) or other respiratory viruses (influenza virus type A (n=2), rhinovirus (n=2), RSV-A and -B) was prepared (for Ct values obtained in initial diagnostics, see supplementaryTable S1).
