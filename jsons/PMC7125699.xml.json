Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is of considerable interest both as an autoimmune disease of the CNS and as a model of immunotherapy for CNS demyelinating diseases. A myelin basic protein-specific, CD4+ T-cell population is required for initiation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. MS and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis have the following common features: CNS demyelination, perivascular CD4+ T cells, association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens, and restricted T-cell receptor variable-gene segment utilization.3 The murine adoptive transfer model in the SJL/J mouse has another important feature of MS\u2014the chronic relapsing clinical course.3 This recurrent course is ideal for manipulating the immune response not only during induction and onset of disease but also during relapse. The pathologic findings are characterized by inflammation and prominent demyelination.3 This autoimmune disease, however, is not associated with an environmental factor.",

In this model, a mild or even subclinical viral encephalitis is followed by a 4-week period of quiescence and then the onset of demyelination. The demyelination in the TMEV model is mediated by viral-specific T lymphocytes. During the demyelinating phase of the disease, however, the virus is persistent; this finding implicates either a low-level expression of viral polypeptides or an immunologic cross-reactivity between virus and myelin antigen (or antigens). As in MS and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, T cells seem to initiate immune-mediated demyelination in TMEV.4\n",

TH1 cells are characterized by secretion of interleukin 2, interferon-\u03b3, and lymphotoxin (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2), whereas TH2 cells produce interleukins 4, 5, 6, and 10. THO cells, which represent a third population, secrete only interleukin 2 and may be precursors of TH1 and TH2 cells.12 Expansion of TH1 cells is favored by the presence of interleukin 2 and interferon-\u03b3. Proliferation of TH2 cells is favored by depletion of CD8+ cells or the presence of only interleukin 2. Recent investigations demonstrated that TH1 and TH2 interactions are complex and may be extremely important in immunoregulation. TH1 cells provide some B-cell assistance, especially for production of IgG2a, and major support for delayed-type hypersensitivity, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, and antiviral immunity. TH2 cells are the major source of B-cell assistance, especially for production of IgGl, IgM, IgA, and IgE, and are directly involved in hypersensitivity reactions.

A new spectrum of immunotherapies has been successfully applied to models of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, including the following examples: (1) cytokine (T-cell growth factor-\u03b21), (2) lymphokine-toxin treatment, (3) anti-T-cell receptor variable \u03b2-gene-specific monoclonal antibody treatment, (4) T-cell vaccination, and (5) blocking peptides. Application of similar therapies to prevent TMEV-induced demyelination will be of considerable interest. Two factors must be considered: (1) Will new therapies activate persistent virus? (2) Will these selective therapies be effective for a long-term period in the setting of continuous low-level expression of viral antigen?",

Among laboratories, no consensus exists about the restriction or heterogeneity of T cells responding to myelin basic protein. A potential linkage or association of MS with genes of the immune system is the focus of recent investigation. The evidence for an environmental cause is compelling.1 Most likely, this factor would be exposure to either an infectious agent such as a virus or a pathogen that produces a superantigen capable of activating T cells.17 Of concern is the possibility that a heterogeneous group of environmental factors could elicit apparently similar symptoms and pathologic changes.",
