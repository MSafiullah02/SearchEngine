However, relatively low specificity and the complex analytical processes are the major limitations when pan-viral oligonucleotide microarrays are used to detect viral pathogens. In this study, genusspecific oligonucleotides were used as probes and modified sample preparations were carried out to improve the specificity and accuracy of the pan-viral oligonucleotide microarray. Genus-specific 63-mer oligonucleotide probes were used for screening human pathogenic RNA viruses. A total of 628 oligonucleotide probes covering 32 RNA viral genera from 14 viral families were used. The number of oligonucleotide probes was decreased to simplify the analytical process of hybridization and to minimize cross-hybridization. Host genomes were removed by DNase I/RNase T1 digestion before viral nucleic acid extraction, and nonribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription to minimize interference of host genomes. Cultured viruses were used for microarray validation. The microarray was validated by cultured isolates that belonged to five viral genera. By using DNase I/RNase T1 digestion before viral nucleic acid extraction and non-ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription, the specificity of the microarray was improved. Furthermore, the analytical process of hybridization results was simplified. The specificity of pan-viral microarray could be improved by using genus-specific oligonucleotides as probes and by using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription. Combined with subsequent degenerate reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing processes, this improved genus-specific oligonucleotides microarray provides a relatively flexible strategy for diagnosis of RNA virus diseases.",

            "text": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time RT-PCR are the most common and widely used methods for routine screening of viral pathogens. However, the main limitation of these techniques is that the maximum number of viruses detectable in a single assay is relatively small. DNA microarray has gained much attention in detecting pathogens due to its high-throughput and the explosive growth of pathogen genomic sequences available in public databases. In recent years, low-density microarrays with short oligonucleotide probes (such as 20-30 mer that are sensitive to single-base mismatches) have been used to detect or identify subtypes of known viruses [Sengupta et al., 2003; Boriskin et al., 2004; Korimbocus et al., 2005; J\u00e4 \u00e4 skel\u00e4 inen et al., 2006] . High-density microarray with long oligonucleotide probes (such as 60-70 mer) have been explored to detect a large number of viruses and identify unknown or unsequenced members of existing viral families [Wang et al., 2002 [Wang et al., , 2003 Palacios et al., 2007] . However, relatively low specificity and sensitivity and complex analytical processes are the major limitations when pan-viral oligonucleotide arrays are used to detect viral pathogens [Chou et al., 2006] . One reason for low sensitivity and low specificity is the low level of viral nucleic acids compared with that of the host genome within the sample preparation. As nucleic acids from unknown viruses can only be amplified with sequence-independent PCR methods before microarray hybridization, the low level of viral nucleic acids in a sample make it probable that the vast majority of amplicons produced by random amplification do not contain the target sequences of interest, which in turn, reduces hybridization specificity and detection sensitivity. Thousands of oligonucleotide probes printed on arrays also make the analysis of hybridization unwieldy.",

By using oligonucleotide probes only at the genus level, the numbers of oligonucleotide probes printed on arrays was decreased dramatically, which in turn, made the analytical process more straightforward. To improve the specificity and accuracy of the microarray, the host genomic DNA and RNA were removed before viral RNA extraction [Chou et al., 2006] . Furthermore, to reduce the interference of host genomes on microarray hybridization, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription. All the known genomic-size viral sequences include nonribosomal hexanucleotides [Allander et al., 2005] , therefore, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides can reverse transcribe viral RNA more efficiently than ribosomal RNA of host cells. Finally, the specificity of the microarray was validated by using cultured viruses from different genera.",

A total of 32 RNA viral genera from 14 viral families were included in this study. Viral genome sequences were downloaded from Genbank. To select the most conserved regions, viral sequences in each genus were aligned by software ClustalX (version 1.83). Arraydesigner 4.0 was employed for designing the oligonucleotide probes. Some probes published by other groups [Wang et al., 2002 [Wang et al., , 2003 Chou et al., 2006 ] were adopted and modified for this study. Generally, 10-30 oligonucleotides of 63-mer were designed and selected to cover all the isolates in each genus, and in total, 628 viral oligonucleotide probes were included. Tm value of these oligonucleotides was 75 AE 58C, which was necessary to ensure that all the oligonucleotides had similar hybridization dynamics. By sequence alignment analysis, the significant homology of each oligonucleotide sequence with the sequences in the same genus was >25 nt. Then, the probes were optimized by pairwise BLASTN program to select those sharing <50% sequence similarity with other viral genera.

The mixture contained 96 non-ribosomal hexanucleotides [Endoh et al., 2005] ; each linked to a specific primer sequence (GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TC). After RNase H digestion, synthesized cDNA was amplified with a 1:9 mixture of the non-ribosomal hexanucleotide mixture and a primer that targeted the specific primer sequence, as previously described [Wang et al., 2002] . Each PCR contained 10 ml 10\u00c2 PCR buffer, 6 ml cDNA, 0.25 mM dNTP, 2.5 U EX Taq (TaKaRa Bio, Inc, Dalian, China) in a 100-ml volume.

The tested results confirmed that these viral isolates were successfully identified at the genus levels after DNase I/RNase T1 digestion and non-ribosomal hexanucleotide reverse transcription (Fig. 1) . The hybridization results of nonpretreated viruses were difficult to interpret due to cross-hybridization (data not shown). The number of oligonucleotide probes decreased dramatically compared to other pan-viral microarrays [Wang et al., 2002 [Wang et al., , 2003 Palacios et al., 2007] , therefore, analysis of the hybridization results was simplified significantly because of the reduction in intensive computation. Although non-specific hybridization could not be avoided completely, the positive results could easily be judged by TreeView-analyzed graphs. Furthermore, the specificity of the assays using pretreated cultures was improved significantly compared with non-pretreated cultures (Fig. 2) . From the hybridization imaging and TreeView-analyzed graphs, nonspecific hybridization was decreased significantly.

Due to the tolerance of long oligonucleotides to sequence mismatches, these arrays have been used to detect many known viruses and to identify unknown or unsequenced members of existing viral families. Derisi's group first designed 1,600 viral oligonucleotides (70-mers) that represented about 140 viruses in 2002 [Wang et al., 2002] , and the number was increased to 10,000, which covered about 1,000 viruses in 2003 [Wang et al., 2003] . They identified the novel SARS coronavirus and confirmed that the combination of array hybridization followed by direct viral sequence recovery can serve as a general strategy. With this strategy, novel viruses and emerging infectious disease can be rapidly identified and characterized. Lipkin's group have developed GreeneChipVr version 1.0 that contains 9,477 probes for all vertebrate viruses in the integrated ICTV/NCBI database (1,710 species) [Palacios et al., 2007] . These studies have highlighted the potential of pan-viral microarrays for detection of many known and unknown viral isolate. To increase the specificity, Chou et al. [2006] have developed a new method to design probes using genus and species probe sets to facilitate a cross-examination strategy. The identity of a virus is established by the concordant results for the genus-and species-specific probes. However, too many oligonucleotides make the Fig. 2 . a: Detection of Sindbis virus belongs to Alphavirus by genus-specific RNA viral oligonucleotide microarray with or without sample pretreatment. The hybridization patterns were manifested by using computer-assisted false two-color imaging. Virus infected culture was labeled with Cy5 and non-infected culture was labeled with Cy3 fluorescent molecules. Oligonucleotide probes of one genus were printed in different blocks. Sample pretreatment with DNaseI/ RNaseT1 digestion and non-ribosomal hexanucleotides reverse transcription (A) greatly improved the specificity of hybridization than non-pretreatment (B). b: Detection of Hantaan virus belongs to Hantavirus (B, C) and Rabies virus belongs to Lyssavirus (D, E) by genus-specific RNA viral oligonucleotide microarray with or without sample pretreatment.

            "text": "Compared with the host genomes, the relatively low number of viral nucleic acids is another drawback of microarrays for broad virus screening. The over-representation of the host genome in the total nucleic acid population is a major factor that interferes with microarray analysis. In pan-microbial microarray detection, unknown pathogens are amplified with sequence-independent PCR methods, such as randomprimed PCR [Froussard, 1992; Vora et al., 2004; Allander et al., 2005] and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) [Reyes and Kim, 1991; Linnen et al., 1996; Ambrose and Clewley, 2006 ]. Both methods are efficient but non-selectively amplify all DNA in the sample. Inevitably, the host genomes are abundantly amplified due to their high representation within total nucleic acids during sample preparations, either from viral cultures or virusinfected clinical specimens. To improve the detection specificity of microarrays, DNase I/RNase T1 digestion was used before RNA extraction, and reversely transcribed RNA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotide mixed primers. As viral nucleic acids are generally protected from DNase degradation by the more stable protein capsids, and sometimes also by a lipid envelope [Allander et al., 2001] , DNase I/RNase T1 treatment can effectively remove the host genomes. A large quantity of rRNA from host genomes reduces the efficiency of reverse transcription of viral RNA, therefore, the adoption of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides as primers can enhance the reverse transcription of viral RNA. Daiji et al. [2005] have confirmed that sequences of selected non-ribosomal hexanucleotides are normally present in known viral sequences. Based on this finding, reverse transcription was performed by using these 96 non-ribosomal hexanucleotides; each of which was linked to a specific tag sequence as the primer. This can further decrease the interference of host genomes.",

Using DNase I/RNase T1 digestion before RNA Fig. 3 . a: Identification of clinical viral isolate from patient with encephalitis to the species level using RNA viral microarray. The hybridization intensities were analyzed by Genepix 5.0 and graphed by Treeview software. The results indicated the isolated pathogen was a virus which belongs to genus Flavivirus. b: RT-PCR result of the clinical viral isolate from patient with encephalitis and from infected swine. Specific RT-PCR assay was designed to amplify a 211-bp product from position 2487 to 2697 in NS1 region of JEV. Lane M, DNA Marker DL2000; Lane P, positive control; Lane 0, negative control; Lane 1-5, different samples of infected swine brain tissues; Lane 6-9, different cerebrospinal fluids samples collected from encephalitis patients. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com] extraction and non-ribosomal hexanucleotides as primers for reverse transcription, the specificity and accuracy of microarrays were improved through reducing the interference of host genomes. This microarray can be used for screening of cultured viruses and clinical viral isolates. Compared with the complex viral species microarray, this platform is relatively cost effective and flexible.",

The average intensity of oligonucleotides in each genus from the microarray is depicted as a vertical stripe. Hybridization intensity on the microarray is reflected by red color of the stripes. Black indicates the signal below threshold, and a continuous color scale (red) indicates Cy3 or Cy5 hybridization intensity above threshold. The horizontal distance of each genus is generated by numbers ofoligonucleotides in each genera. (A) Indication of different genera (due to the limited space, some viral genera are not displayed); (B) hybridization results of Sindbis virus which belongs to Alphavirus; (C-G) represent the results of H3N2 influenza virus which belongs to Influenza virus A (IAV) (C), Dengue virus which belongs to Flavivirus (D), and Rabies virus which belongs to Lyssavirus (E), YFV virus belongs to Flavivirus (F), Hantaan virus belongs to Hantavirus (G), respectively.
