Today, most egg donors are not currently pursing infertility treatment themselves but are willing to donate their gametes for altruistic or commercial reasons. Since its initiation, oocyte donation services have spread throughout the USA and to many areas of the world. In the USA, 9,000-10,000 donor oocyte cycles occur annually [ 4 ] . Though donor oocyte IVF is available throughout the USA, globally the practice of oocyte donation varies due to legal restrictions in many countries (Chap. 30 ). The compensation and recruitment practices for oocyte donors vary worldwide and largely depend upon current legal or cultural practices in that locale. For instance, countries, such as the UK and Canada, have strict restrictions on donor compensation, while others, such as Italy and Germany, prohibit compensation [ 5 ] . Donor compensation guidelines do not exist in the USA, and regional differences in compensation do occur [ 6, 7 ] . In the USA, donors are recruited mainly through the Internet, television, radio, and newspaper advertisements. Donors are \"matched\" to recipient couples often based on educational credentials, extracurricular activities, phenotypic traits, and ethnic origins. Though providing recipients with the choice of egg donors who exhibit these traits and qualities is important, the selection and screening process is much more comprehensive in order to ensure the safety and health of the donor, recipient, and the offspring.",

In summary, the potential donor should consider all legal matters both known and possible during the informed consent process (further discussed under Obligations and Rights). Detailed medical risks involved with the process of oocyte donation should also be discussed while consenting. Donors need to be aware of the acute risks and adverse effects of ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval, including but not limited to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), intraperitoneal hemorrhage, and pelvic infection (Chap. 19 ) [ 15 ] . There may also be risks associated with the use of anesthesia provided during the oocyte retrieval including allergic reaction to anesthetic drugs and respiratory compromise secondary to aspiration. However, among the young healthy population of donors, this risk is very small [ 16 ] . In fact, previous studies have suggested that donors are at lower risk for OHSS and other adverse events than patients undergoing autologous IVF [ 17 ] . Programs may wish to provide donors with adequate supplemental insurance coverage for medical complications arising from oocyte donation, and the terms of such coverage should be disclosed to the donor (further discussed in Chap. 20 ).",

Responsible practice fosters good outcomes and continued success.

Dr. Thornton reviews the important basic requirements for establishing an egg donor program. Many of these professional activities are now being provided by \"agencies,\" which are typically not run by physicians, who then supply patients or programs with \"matches.\" Regardless of whether an agency supplies the donor or a program chooses to screen potential donors themselves, the outlined steps provided in this chapter are crucial to follow in order to ensure safety and health.

Injury to any one of them is catastrophic and ironically may in fact leave them infertile. We also can assume that some of these women will later experience infertility themselves and naturally will assume that their work as an egg donor contributed to their problem. Disclosure of all potential risks, including later regret, is dif fi cult to do without frightening potential donors away. However, I believe it is better to inform each of them of the known complications and lose a few candidates rather than to perform a procedure that later leads to lifelong regret. It has always been my hope that every egg donor will look back on the experience with pride and satisfaction for having provided a truly unique gift of life.",
