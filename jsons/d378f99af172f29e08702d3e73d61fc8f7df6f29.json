There are over 1,100 recognized species of bats classified within the order Chiroptera, although distinction between species is often technically challenging due to morphological similarities between different species. The determination of bat species has been aided by the development of genetic tools that enable differentiation between very closely related species alongside the more traditional morphological and ecological classification techniques. Such techniques serve to classify groups of mammals as accurately as possible. As a result, bat species continue to be reclassified.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Currently, the order Chiroptera is divided into 19 different families that are further classified into numerous subfamilies and genera C H A P T E R (Table 6 .1). Additional classification has subdivided this order into suborders Vespertilioniformes and Pteropodiformes. The Vespertilioniformes includes three superfamilies of bats: the Emballonuroidae (sheathtailed bats of the Old and the New Worlds that are divided across two subfamilies); the Noctilionoidea (a large highly diverse subfamily with seven families-some of which include omnivorous bat species); and the Vespertilionidea (the largest superfamily of insectivorous bats that includes four distinct families). The Pteropodiformes includes the family Pterpodidae (the Old World fruit bats sometimes referred to as the 'megabats') and five Old World families of insectivorous or carnivorous bats that make up the superfamily Rhinolophoidea, namely: the Craseonycteridae, the Hipposideridae, the Megadermatidae, the Rhinolophidae and the Rhinopomatidae (Hutcheon & Kirsch, 2006; Teeling et al., 2005) . Across these suborders, bats can be described according to their feeding habits, and it is this feature of the bat life cycle that we will use to group lyssavirus infections of bats (Altringham, 2011; Giannini & Simmons, 2003) (Table 6 .1). Detection of viral pathogens within different bat species, often highlighted through epizootics that have affected both human and animal populations, have fuelled extensive research into bats as hosts of viral pathogens. More recently, the detection of coronaviruses (Shirato et al., 2012) , filoviruses (Towner et al., 2009 ) and henipaviruses (Halpin et al., 2011) have sparked further interest in bats as reservoirs of viral pathogens.

There are currently 12 defined lyssavirus species and a further 2 recently described viruses that all appear to cause, where reported, rabies pathogenesis in humans and terrestrial carnivores (Figure 6.1) . Importantly, from the perspective of human vaccination, the different lyssavirus species have been divided into three phylogroups according to antigenic divergence and effectiveness of rabies vaccines. Phylogroup I viruses are all effectively neutralized by the current rabies vaccines, based on classical rabies virus strains while viruses categorized in phylogroups II and III are not neutralized by antibodies produced following standard rabies virus vaccination (Figure 6 .1). Viruses include: rabies virus (RABV), which has been shown to infect a diverse range of species including bats in the New World and carnivores around the globe; Lagos bat virus (LBV), which has been detected in frugivorous bats, cats, and dogs but has not been associated with human infection (Kuzmin et al., 2008a; Markotter et al., 2006) ; Mokola virus (MOKV), which has caused natural infection of shrews, rats, cats, dogs, and two human cases (Sabeta et al., 2007) ; Duvenhage virus (DUVV), which has been isolated from insectivorous bats and has caused human fatalities following exposure to bat bites (Weyer et al., 2011) ; European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1), which has been detected primarily in insectivorous bats but has also been associated with cross species transmission (CST) events into what are considered dead-end hosts, including sheep, a stone marten, cats, and humans (M\u00fcller et al., 2007) ; European bat lyssavirus-2 (EBLV-2), which has been isolated from insectivorous bats alongside two documented human fatalities (Fooks et al., 2003a, b) ; Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is endemic in frugivorous and insectivorous bats across Australasia and has also 'spilled over' into human populations (Moore et al., 2010) ; and Irkut virus (IRKV) that has caused human infection, Aravan virus (ARAV), Khujand virus (KHUV) and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) Kuzmin et al., 2003 Kuzmin et al., , 2005 Kuzmin et al., , 2008b that are all associated with insectivorous bats, although only single isolates exist for each species (Anonymous, 2009) .

Despite this, there remain two distinct lyssaviruses that have not yet been detected in bat species: MOKV and IKOV. In the case of MOKV, the reservoir remains unclear. Numerous virus isolates have been reported from different species, including organ pools from shrews (Crocidura sp) in Nigeria (1968) Shope et al., 1970) and Cameroon (1974) (Le-Gonidec, Rickenbach, Robin, & Heme, 1978) (Swanepoel, 1994) ; domestic cats (Felis catus) in South Africa (1970, (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) , Zimbabwe (1981 Zimbabwe ( -1982 (Foggin, 1983) and Ethiopia (1989 Ethiopia ( -1990 (Mebatsion, Cox, & Frost, 1992) ; and the rusty-bellied brush furred rat (Lophuromys sikapusi) in the Central African Republic (1983) (Saluzzo et al., 1984) .

Infections with MOKV are rare, with scant surveillance initiatives and limited diagnostic capacity, perhaps perpetuating our lack of knowledge of this lyssavirus (Sabeta et al., 2007) . Although MOKV antibodies have been detected in bat species, it is widely accepted that this is due to cross reactivity with antibodies against LBV, rather than evidence of MOKV circulation, although further sampling of different bat species may discover that MOKV also circulates in bats in the Old World (Dzikwi et al., 2010; Kuzmin et al., 2008a) .

The discovery of IKOV was the first detection of a non-rabies lyssavirus in African civets. Furthermore, the detection of this virus within the boundaries of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, during routine dog rabies surveillance activities highlights the importance of molecular characterization of virus isolates where surveillance initiatives are in place (Marston et al., 2012; Mebatsion, Cox, & Frost, 1992) . Analysis of sequence data generated from infected samples indicates that IKOV is the most divergent lyssavirus reported (Figure 6 .1). The Serengeti National Park has been free of classical dog rabies for many years, with rabies cases clustering outside of the park in neighboring villages. Therefore, the isolated detection of this lyssavirus within the park from a terrestrial and largely solitary species strongly suggests that IKOV represents a CST event that could be of bat origin given the viruses close phylogenetic relationship with WCBV (Marston et al., 2012) .Without further isolates of this and more closely related lyssaviruses the reservoir for IKOV remains to be elucidated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 533, "text": "(Marston et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 534, "end": 564, "text": "Mebatsion, Cox, & Frost, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1136, "text": "(Marston et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 687, "end": 696, "text": "(Figure 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "FIGURE 6.1 Phylogenetic distance between lyssavirus species based on substitutions"}, {"text": "The evolutionary history of lyssaviruses within bats remains unresolved. Across the New World, only variants of classical RABV are associated with the infection of bat species, whereas other lyssaviruses remain completely absent across the New World in either volant or nonvolant mammalian populations. Indeed, RABV has been detected in more than 50 species of insectivorous bat across the New World alone (see Section 6.2). In direct contrast, across the Old World there have been no detections of classical RABV strains in any bat species despite the presence of classical RABV in terrestrial species. Instead, 12 genetically divergent non-RABV lyssaviruses have been characterized from different bat species in the Old World. The reason for this situation remains unclear, however, tests for neutrality using various evolutionary algorithms on a panel of lyssavirus G protein sequences suggest neutral evolution occurs for lyssaviruses, and therefore niche-partitioning and radiation may explain this genetic pattern (Badrane & Tordo, 2001) . Interestingly, where different bat species have been associated with lyssavirus infection, there often appears to be, to some extent, a host restriction to infection with genetically distinct lyssaviruses. RABV itself may be exploiting relatively new niches in previously uninfected New World bats (Streicker et al., 2010) .

This approach demonstrated that RABV variants from North America could be differentiated and that different virus isolates were often associated with the reservoir host, including a range of non-flying species such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), racoons (Procyon lotor), and skunks (Mephitis mephitis) (Smith, 1988) . RABV from particular bat species also showed distinctive monoclonal antibody binding patterns. This was confirmed in both Canada (Nadin- Davis et al., 2001) and Mexico (Velasco-Villa et al., 2002) . Importantly, it was also noted that the only lyssavirus species isolated in New World bats, and indeed all non-bat reservoirs, are variants of RABV, with no detection of non-RABV lyssaviruses being reported in the Americas.

A comparison of four species of North American insectivorous bats that are most commonly reported as rabid (Table 6 .3) indicates that traits such as colony size or geographical distribution do not support any particular hypothesis for their association with RABV. Indeed, it appears that the majority of North American bat species have been associated with RABV infection to varying extents. Recent phylogenetic analysis of RABV species isolated from North American bat species suggests that a model of CST followed by virus evolution within a particular host species fits the current diversity of the virus within insectivorous bats (Streicker et al., 2010) . This implies that the majority of RABV transmissions within bats are intra-species events. It also suggests that the transmission of bat variants of RABV from a bat to other mammals, including humans, is a rare event. Experiments from the 1960s demonstrated that bat variants of RABV could infect a range of carnivores, although some species showed greater susceptibility than others (Constantine, 1966a,b) . In addition to inoculation by intramuscular injection, transmission to conspecifics was also demonstrated by repeated biting, in some cases over one hundred times, by an infected Mexican free-tailed bat (Constantine, 1966c) . Examples of bat variant infections in non-bat species have been reported, including from Canada where CST of a bat variant to a squirrel was reported (Webster, Casey, & Charlton, 1988) as well as that of CST to two red foxes and a cow (Webster, Casey, & Charlton, 1989) . Such CST events are rare, and in the majority of cases there has been no evidence of onward transmission and maintenance of the infecting virus isolate within the new host species. However, two very rare events where CSTs have led to the maintenance of virus in the non-chiropteran host have been documented. One such event occurred on Prince Edward Island, Canada, where a cluster of rabies cases in red foxes (V. vulpes) was observed. Screening of the viruses isolated, with a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies, suggested that they were of bat origin, possibly the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) (Daoust, Wandeler, & Casey, 1996) . A larger epizootic occurred following the emergence of rabies in the skunk (M. mephitis) population in the state of Arizona (Leslie et al., 2006) .

However, the report of a human rabies case transmitted from a Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida braziliensis) (Favi et al., 2002) highlighted the role that insectivorous bats play in the ecology of RABV and the risks to public health. An additional study updated the list of all bat species (insectivorous, frugivorous, and hematophagus) that have been shown to be positive for RABV in Brazil and included 41 species from the families Molossidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae (Sodre, da Gama, & de Almeida, 2010) . The wealth of sequence data available for RABV isolates from New World bat species has led to detailed attempts to create genealogical trees that include all bat reservoir species . This approach confirmed earlier findings on the association between particular virus lineages and bat species separating RABV variants into at least 14 groups. A general observation was the influence of geographical separation of certain species that are located in both North and South America. For example, the RABV variants associated with Tadarida braziliensis formed two clusters dependent on the geographical origin of the bat. This was consistently shown for both Myotis and Eptesicus species. The surprising exceptions to this were those RABV viruses associated with Lasiurus species (L. cinereus, L. borelialis and L. ega), which formed a single group .

Indeed, the first link to a rabies-like infection was established in 1954 when the first report of a rabid bat in Europe was made in Germany (Mohr, 1957) . The species of bat involved in this incident was not reported, although subsequent detections of lyssaviruses in serotine bats may suggest that early bat rabies cases in Europe involved this species. Only with the advent of antigenic typing and molecular tools could the virus isolated in European bats be distinguished from classical RABV and other lyssavirus species (Bourhy et al., 1992; Schneider & Cox, 1994) . Serotine bats belong to the genus Eptesicus of the subfamily Vespertilioninae, chiropteran family Vespertilionidae of the suborder Vespertilioniformes. Up to 39 insectivorous species of Eptesicus are known to exist (Hutson, Mickleburgh, & Racey, 2001; Niethammer & Krapp, 2011) . Of the 39 species of Eptesicus, E. serotinus isabellinus and E. serotinus deserve special attention, as they are primarily associated with transmission of EBLV-1. E. serotinus is the most widespread and abundant Palaearctic species of Eptesicus in Europe. Its present range extends from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean basin to Northern Denmark and the Eastern parts of the Eurasian continent as far as the Pacific seaboards, with evidence for an expansion into Scandinavia (Figure 6.2A) . E. s. isabellinus has been reported in North Africa and Southern Iberia and is considered to be genetically divergent from E. serotinus (Ibanez, Garc\u00eda-Mudarra, Ruedi, Stadelmann, & Juste, 2006 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 246, "text": "(Mohr, 1957)", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 618, "end": 639, "text": "(Bourhy et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 640, "end": 662, "text": "Schneider & Cox, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 880, "end": 916, "text": "(Hutson, Mickleburgh, & Racey, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 917, "end": 942, "text": "Niethammer & Krapp, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1637, "text": "(Ibanez, Garc\u00eda-Mudarra, Ruedi, Stadelmann, & Juste, 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lyssavirus Infection of Serotine Bats"}, {"text": "Serotine bats are one of the most studied lyssavirus reservoir species, revealing some fundamental insights into virus-host interactions and, hence, possibly the epidemiology of bat lyssavirus infections in insectivorous bat species in the Old World. E. serotinus and E. s. isabellinus are known to be associated with EBLV-1 and thus, are considered the primary reservoir hosts for this particular bat-associated lyssavirus. Interestingly, of the 959 cases of bat rabies officially reported between 1977 and 2010 to the database of the Rabies Bulletin Europe (RBE) about 95% have been observed in E. serotinus (Schatz et al., 2012) . The involvement of E. s. isabellinus in the epidemiology of EBLV-1 was demonstrated in southern Spain when rabid serotine bats were later genetically identified as Isabelline serotine bats (Perez-Jorda et al., 1995; Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008a; Vazguez-Moron et al., 2008b) . During the past 50 years, the vast majority of rabid serotine bats in Europe have been diagnosed in densely populated countries of The North European Plain that covers large areas of Denmark, The Netherlands, and Germany. However, this clustering of reported bat rabies cases suggests a bias in surveillance activities that reflects the location of established networks of bat handlers and their activities (Figure 6 .2A). Regardless of this potential bias in sampling, it seems clear that the serotine bat has particular host species-specific ecological traits that may promote the maintenance and transmission of EBLV-1. Indeed E. serotinus is a very adaptable species with habitats including semi-desert, temperate, and subtropical dry forest, Mediterranean-type scrubland, farmland, and suburban areas. Furthermore, in contrast to other bat species, it is not experiencing a decline in population size. Hence, a greater abundance of E. serotinus might favor virus amplification and may explain the clusters of bat rabies cases detected in densely populated areas. The northern distribution range of serotine bats seems to be limited by a threshold level of mean summer temperatures (Harbusch, 2003) . Interestingly, the great majority of EBLV-1-infected E. serotinus have been reported from this northern range. This is supported by surveillance for EBLV-1 in Germany, a country with a north-south gradient in elevation where over several decades notably higher numbers of cases have been reported from the northern regions of the country, where the highest density of E. serotinus is found (M\u00fcller et al., 2007) . Taking this into account might explain why in some European countries with existing E. serotinus populations, no or only sporadic cases of EBLV-1 infections are observed (Anonymous, 2012; Van der Poel et al., 2005) . Despite the limitations of surveillance, based on the current knowledge of EBLV-infections it is likely that serotine bats may be infected with EBLV-1 throughout Eurasia (Schatz et al., 2012) . For reasons unknown, however, longterm active and passive surveillance for lyssaviruses has provided no evidence for EBLV-1 circulation in serotine bat populations in southern England, although specific antibodies have been detected in a single serotine bat (Harris et al., 2009 ). This disparity between mainland Europe and the UK may be due to the limited geographical distribution and population size of E. serotinus within the UK preventing EBLV-1 persistence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 610, "end": 631, "text": "(Schatz et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 823, "end": 849, "text": "(Perez-Jorda et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 850, "end": 878, "text": "Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 879, "end": 907, "text": "Vazguez-Moron et al., 2008b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2112, "text": "(Harbusch, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2526, "text": "(M\u00fcller et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 2699, "end": 2716, "text": "(Anonymous, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2717, "end": 2743, "text": "Van der Poel et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}, {"start": 2916, "end": 2937, "text": "(Schatz et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 3198, "end": 3218, "text": "(Harris et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1317, "end": 1326, "text": "(Figure 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "EPIDEMIOLOGY OF LYSSAVIRUS INFECTION OF SEROTINE BATS"}, {"text": "The molecular characterization of EBLV-1 isolates from serotine bats has revealed valuable clues to virus-host interactions and help resolve questions surrounding the epidemiological puzzle of this virus-host relationship. With approximately 5 \u00d7 10 5 substitutions per site per year the evolutionary rate of nucleotide substitution of EBLV-1 is one of the lowest recorded for RNA viruses, suggesting that the current genetic diversity of the virus in serotine bats arose between 500 and 750 years ago (Davis et al., 2005) although other estimates predict a more recent evolution (Hughes, 2008) . Either way, this is believed to reflect an evolutionary stability between EBLV-1 and its two host species (Davis et al., 2005) . Based on unique molecular traits, however, there is evidence that the phylogeny of this virus is more complex than previously thought and clearly associated with geographically different host evolutionary history (Vazquez-Moron et al., 2011) . Early genomic sequencing indicated that in European populations of serotine bats two distinct genetic lineages of EBLV-1 evolved, which seemed to geographically cluster (Amengual et al., 1997) . Serotine bats throughout the North and East European Plains, for example, located between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the north, and the Central European Highlands to the south, are infected by EBLV-1 lineage \"a.\" These isolates have been reported to exhibit an extremely high sequence identity, as confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the N-gene (Amengual et al., 1997; Davis et al., 2005; Van der Poel et al., 2005) . Despite its extensive West-East geographic range, the low genetic diversity in connection with a consistent star-like structure of the phylogenetic network suggests a relatively recent introduction, evolution, and rapid expansion of EBLV-1a variants in populations of serotine bats in these parts of Europe (Vazquez-Moron et al., 2011) . Although in early studies no, or only a less pronounced, correlation between geographic and genetic distances was observed with lineage 1a using both a hypothetical introduction point or a model based origin of a putative common ancestor (Amengual et al., 1997; Davis et al., 2005) , cluster analysis showed a significant positive correlation between genetic and temporal and spatial distance based on N-gene sequence and provided evidence for a geographical segregation (Freuling et al., 2008a (Freuling et al., , 2012a . EBLV-1a isolates from serotine bats within certain geographical regions of The Netherlands and Germany have almost identical nucleotide sequences. This indicates genomic stability during the transmission cycle of these virus variants, with little geographic spread or intermixing (Freuling et al., 2008a; Van der Poel et al., 2005) . Serotine bat colonies usually number 10 to 50, although occasionally up to 300 individuals have been recorded Niethammer & Krapp, 2011) .

A recent phylogenetic analysis segregated E. s. isabellinus sequences from the E. serotinus sequences and hypothesized that the E. s. isabellinus isolates form a further independent lineage, EBLV-1 lineage 'c' (Vazquez-Moron et al., 2011) . Considering that serotine bats do not normally migrate over large distances, recent single discoveries of EBLV-1b in Central Poland and Eastern Germany (M\u00fcller et al., unpublished data; Smreczak et al., 2007) may suggest that the distribution of this lineage is more widespread in Europe than previously considered. As there is evidence of genetic flow between E. s. isabellinus populations on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar, there is reason to believe that North African conspecifics may also be infected with this lineage (Juste et al., 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 169, "text": "(Amengual et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 390, "end": 410, "text": "(Davis et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 411, "end": 431, "text": "M\u00fcller et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 644, "end": 672, "text": "(Vazquez-Moron et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 827, "end": 860, "text": "(M\u00fcller et al., unpublished data;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 861, "end": 883, "text": "Smreczak et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1226, "text": "(Juste et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 102, "text": "(Figure 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "EPIDEMIOLOGY OF LYSSAVIRUS INFECTION OF SEROTINE BATS"}, {"text": "It remains unclear, however, exactly how populations of serotine bats in different parts of Europe favor the current geographic distribution and clustering of the two or three different EBLV-1 lineages. Additional genetic data from both the host species and virus isolates are required to fully understand the evolutionary EBLV-1-serotine bat interaction. In any case, serotine bats in the westernmost parts of the North European Plains represent the only geographical location where both EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b are detected ( Van der Poel et al., 2005; Picard-Meyer et al., 2006) . However, as co-infection of serotine colonies or infection of individuals with both lineages has not been reported, this may suggest independent infectious cycles among E. serotinus. Interestingly, results of recapture data and long-term active rabies surveillance in maternity colonies of E. s. isabellinus strongly suggest close communities in which variants of EBLV-1 independently circulate (Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008b) . Also, provided the hypothesis of an inverse correlation between CST of lyssaviruses and phylogenetic distance between bat species as recently demonstrated for North American bat RABV also applies to European bats (Streicker et al., 2010) , then future targeted surveillance should discover the existence of known or new EBLV-1 lineages.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 524, "end": 550, "text": "Van der Poel et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}, {"start": 551, "end": 577, "text": "Picard-Meyer et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 975, "end": 1004, "text": "(Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1244, "text": "(Streicker et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF221"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EPIDEMIOLOGY OF LYSSAVIRUS INFECTION OF SEROTINE BATS"}, {"text": "Based on the limited observational studies and experimental data of infection in serotine bats, our understanding of the transmission and pathogenesis of EBLV-1 under natural conditions is incomplete. Hence, clinical implications of EBLV-1 infections in serotine bats are discussed. It is clear that E. serotinus is known to succumb to clinical infections and therefore is likely to be submitted for rabies diagnosis (Freuling et al., 2009a) . However, reports on EBLV-1 related clinical signs in serotine bats are rare and stem either from animals kept in captivity in bat sanctuaries or experimental studies. Although no information exists concerning the incubation period in naturally infected E. serotinus bats, the incubation periods in experimentally infected bats varies depending on the route of inoculation, with the intracerebral route leading to the shortest incubation period (7-13 days), followed by subcutaneous (17-18 days) and intramuscular (26 days) routes (Freuling et al., 2009b) . Because intranasal inoculation was ineffective in experimentally inducing clinical rabies, transmission of EBLV-1 among serotine bats via non-bite exposures in nature seems highly unlikely (Johnson, Phillpotts, & Fooks, 2006a) . The subcutaneous route of inoculation was relatively efficient in inducing mortality and concomitant shedding of virus in saliva immediately before the development of disease, while intramuscular inoculation was less efficient. Interestingly, experimental intramuscular infection of RABV in Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida braziliensis) caused fewer virus-positive salivary glands compared with that resulting from subcutaneous infection (Baer & Bales, 1967) . From these experimental studies it has been postulated that this may indicate a host-specific adaptation of EBLV-1 and that the subcutaneous route of infection is highly likely to mimic natural transmission among natural hosts via multiple dose infection (Freuling et al., 2009b) . In contrast, inoculation of the North American sibling species E. fuscus with EBLV-1 by the intramuscular route led to the development of disease in 50% of challenged animals . Of note, the detection of EBLV-1 infection in infected E. serotinus taste buds was observed, mimicking studies with human rabies (Jackson et al., 1999) .

Experimentally, EBLV-1 causes disease in serotine bats indistinguishable from that observed with RABV infection of North American bats with clinical signs being consistent with those described above (Freuling et al., 2009b) . Whether the different EBLV-1 lineages exhibit differences in pathogenicity and result in different disease patterns in serotine bats is currently unknown.

In the latter case, serotine bats surviving in this instance should be considered to have had an aborted infection (Banyard et al., 2011) . Although no seroconversion was detected in serotine bats from the Balearic Islands (Spain) and Switzerland (Megali et al., 2010; Serra-Cobo et al., 2002) , measurable virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) titers have been detected in free-living con-specifics from several countries with reported prevalences for seroconversion in single colonies in the UK (0.3%) (Brookes et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2009) , Germany (5.1%) (M\u00fcller et al., unpublished data) , in different studies across Spain (4.8%, 7.7%, 19%, and 74%) (Perez-Jorda et al., 1995) , and in France (25%) (Picard-Meyer et al., 2011) . Similar observations were made in Spanish colonies of E. s. isabellinus, where the overall seroprevalence was estimated to be 9% (Echevarria et al., 2001; Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008b) . However, in an experimental study, none of the E. serotinus infected with EBLV-1 developed VNAs (Freuling et al., 2009b) , while in the North American sibling species E. fuscus VNAs were detected in survivors and deceased animals . Although these serological observations in freeliving Eptesicus spp. have to be interpreted with caution (see the following), this has led some to hypothesize that endemic EBLV-1 is associated with subclinical or mild disease (Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008b) . The only experimental study with EBLV-1 in its host reservoir did not provide any evidence for a subclinical carrier state in serotine bats (Freuling et al., 2009b) as repeatedly suggested (Echevarria et al., 2001; Serra-Cobo et al., 2002) , and hence the existence of such a state remains to be conclusively demonstrated. The assumption that the clinical expression of EBLV-1 in bats is a non-fatal, extra-neurological infection without important consequences for the health of the E. serotinus populations (Echevarria et al., 2001; Vazquez-Moron et al., 2011) is disproved by experimental data and routine rabies diagnostics.

In place, LBV is the lyssavirus most frequently associated with different fruit bat species. Indeed, LBV or antibodies that neutralise LBV have been isolated from several fruit bat species, including the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bat (Epomorphorus wahlbergi), and the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (Dzkiwi et al., 2010; Hayman et al., 2008 Hayman et al., , 2010 . Studies with African fruit bat species have detected a high seroprevalence of antibodies against LBV in these three different colonial fruit bat species, with antibody levels ranging from 14-67% and 29-46%, for the former two species, respectively. Initial studies showed that older R. aegyptiacus and E. helvum were shown to have a higher level of seroprevelance within populations of both species (Kuzmin et al., 2008a; Dzikwi et al., 2010; Hayman et al., 2010) . Data from E. helvum populations derived over a four-year study period demonstrated that seroprevalence in mature bats was significantly greater than that found in juvenile or sexually immature bats. Seroprevalence in sexually mature adults fluctuated between 23% (15-33%) and 49% (39-52%), with no significance seen between the proportion of seropositive sexually mature adults between sampling occasions over the study period (Hayman et al., 2012) . Despite significant levels of LBV seropositivity within bat populations, attempts to isolate virus have often been problematic. Indeed, Hayman et al., (2012) tested 796 oral swabs from healthy E. helvum using RT-PCR but did not detect viral RNA in any sample. Similarly, Kuzmin et al., (2008a) tested 931 oral swabs and 1,182 brain samples from at least 30 different species of bat by RT-PCR, with LBV RNA only being detected in a single E. helvum bat.

Seasonal peaks in the vampire bat population due to births have been associated with an increase in livestock rabies (Lord, 1992) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 244, "end": 267, "text": "(Kobayashi et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 268, "end": 293, "text": "(Kobayashi et al., , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 304, "end": 326, "text": "(da Rosa et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 327, "end": 348, "text": "Barbosa et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 349, "end": 371, "text": "Castilho et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 610, "end": 632, "text": "(Belotto et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 752, "end": 764, "text": "(Lord, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology of Rabies in Vampire Bats"}, {"text": "Attacks on humans are rare; however, one of the most recent cases of rabies in Louisiana occurred in a migrant worker who was likely to have contracted the disease while in his home state of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico (Balsamo et al., 2011) . Anecdotal evidence suggests that the incidence of vampire bat attacks on people resulting in rabies is on the increase. This could be due to an actual increase in virus prevalence in the reservoir, or an increase in attacks by vampire bats on humans, or an increase in incident reporting. Changes in human activity have been responsible for increasing vampire predation. For example, removal of livestock can result in increased biting attacks on humans. Many of the reported outbreaks occur in remote communities with limited access to health care professionals and facilities (da Rosa et al., 2006; Goncalves et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 209, "end": 231, "text": "(Balsamo et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 812, "end": 834, "text": "(da Rosa et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 835, "end": 858, "text": "Goncalves et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 859, "end": 882, "text": "Schneider et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology of Rabies in Vampire Bats"}, {"text": "The main approach to the control of RABV transmission has been to control the bat reservoir, mainly through destruction. This takes the form of habitat destruction, that is, destroying roosting caves, or direct trapping and killing of vampire bats (Mayen, 2003) . However, this often results in the destruction of other bat species. A more focused approach is the application of anticoagulants, either to cattle (Thompson, Mitchell, & Burns, 1972) , or applied directly to captured bats, which are then released. This approach provides a short-term respite but creates an ecological niche that tends to be filled quickly by dispersing vampire bats. Parenteral vaccination of cattle is an effective means of preventing death from rabies infection, although is costly and requires repeated application to every generation. An alternative to this is oral vaccination with plant-derived feed that has been genetically modified to express RABV glycoprotein (McGarvey et al., 1995; Loza-Rubio et al., 2008) . Further investigations have considered vaccination of vampire bats (Aguilar-Setien et al., 1998 , 2002 .

Clearly, many different bat species from different geographical locations and with different feeding habits and ecologies have been found to be infected with different lyssaviruses. However, the unusual distribution of lyssaviruses around the world and their association with particular bat species remains unexplained. Despite the genetic divergence of lyssaviruses detected in different bat species, the disease is similar in all species observed, causing neurological disease where clinical signs are observed. With the exception of vampire bats, the public health risk of rabies in bats remains low, although the consequences of infection are severe. In all species, the mechanisms by which abortive infections occur are unclear. However, there remains no convincing evidence for the existence of a carrier status in bats. While it appears that CST events of lyssaviruses to other mammals, including humans, are rare, the potential for sustained transmission in non-bat hosts exists, although further studies are needed in order to define the many gaps in our understanding of bat lyssaviruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title":
