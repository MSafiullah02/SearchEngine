Although rare, once virologically confirmed lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) has developed, mortality rates due to HRV appear to be high (21% to 41%) and even similar to those seen with other respiratory viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 3, 4, 5. Risk factors associated with LRTI in this population have been defined for RSV, PIVs, influenza, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, which include lymphopenia, use of high\u2013dose steroids, and conditioning regimen; this has not been done systematically in HCT recipients presenting with HRV upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In a study of HRV infection that included both HCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies, factors more likely to be present in patients with LRTI included inpatient status, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia [11]. Of note, not all cases of LRTI were virologically confirmed in this study, and the analysis was not conducted in a time\u2013dependent manner. Furthermore, several key factors including viral load were not evaluated in this study.",

Initially, any variable was retained in the multivariable model if its P \u2264 .1 in the full model. The multivariable model was further reduced for constructing the risk score by evaluating the change in the bootstrapped optimism corrected concordance statistic (c-statistic) when each factor was removed from the full model [14]. The bootstrapped c-statistic was based on 100 replications. Those factors having little impact on the c-statistic were removed. Score point contributions were developed using the hazard ratios from the final multivariable model. Hazard ratios were rounded to the nearest integer and scaled such that the maximum achievable score was 100. The risk score for each subject was calculated based on their covariate values and the associated points given. Curves were constructed to examine impact of shifting cut points of the risk score on sensitivity and specificity rates. Cumulative incidence curves for progression to LRTI for score values above (positive predictive value) and below (negative predictive value) a series of binary cut-off values as well as within categorized ranges of scores were evaluated and compared using log-rank tests and Gray's test.

Among all subjects the score cut-off with the highest sensitivity (57%) and specificity (71%) was 27, corresponding to a positive predictive value of 28% and a negative predictive value of 89% in this population. Cumulative incidence curves for progression to LRTI in all subjects, stratified by above and below a range of binary score cut\u2013offs are shown in Figure 4\nA and B, representing positive and negative predictive values for a given cut\u2013off, respectively. Cumulative incidence of progression to LRTI for the \u226527 group was 28% versus 11% in the <27 group (log-rank and Gray's test both P < .001). Figure 4C illustrates the ability of the score to stratify the population into 4 mutually exclusive levels of risk. Cumulative incidence of progression to LRTI was as follows: scores < 16 (9%), 16 to <27 (13%), 27 to <46 (24%), and \u226546 (43%) (log-rank test and Gray's test both P < .001).

To our knowledge this is the largest and statistically most rigorous study to systematically examine patients specifically presenting with URTI to determine the risk of subsequent LRTI. In multivariable models for any LRTI event in all subjects, significant risk factors identified include allogeneic transplant, prior HRV URTI events, lymphocyte count < 100 \u00d7 106 cells/L, recipient statin use, recipient CMV serostatus, and steroid use \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. We further characterized risk factors for progression by calculating the change in the bootstrapped optimism corrected c-statistic for each risk factor and developed an optimized model for risk prediction. Using this model we developed a weighted score and describe the performance characteristics of the score at various cut\u2013offs. The risk score presented in this article is a novel tool with potential to help risk stratify patients for clinical care and future clinical trials.",

Once HRV LRTI has developed in HCT recipients, mortality rates are comparable with those associated with RSV, influenza, and PIV [3]. In a study of HRV infection that included both HCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies, factors more likely to be present in patients with LRTI included inpatient status, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia [11]. In HCT recipients alone from the same center, hypoalbuminemia, and isolation of respiratory co-pathogen were associated with LRTI in multivariable models [4]. These analyses, although not done in a time-dependent manner, are similar to findings in the present study, in which lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia were associated with progression to LRTI. We evaluated co-pathogens in the upper respiratory tract as a risk factor and did not find an association with LRTI.",

The role of statins on HRV progression should be validated in other cohorts and evaluated for other respiratory virus infections independently.",

CT value as a surrogate for viral load has limitations given the diversity of HRV genotypes and the resulting differences in amplification efficiency using RT-qPCR assays with a consensus HRV primer and probe set. RT digital PCR has been recently shown to provide more precise quantification [30]. However, even when evaluating the extreme highest viral load group (CT values in the lowest 10th percentile), no effect was seen. In lung transplant recipients, higher HRV viral load was associated with increased symptoms associated with LRTI [31]. In immunocompetent pediatric patients, viral load was associated with disease severity in older but not younger children [32] and was also associated with higher rates of viremia and oxygen use [33]. The variable role of viral load in studies to date suggest both limitations in capturing accurate viral loads from clinical samples such as was done in our study and that other host factors including immune responses may be an important player in progression to LRTI and other clinical outcomes. Additionally, HRV species were not evaluated in the present study, and data have suggested HRV-C may be associated with worse outcomes, especially in children 34, 35. The presence of viral co\u2013pathogens in the upper respiratory tract was not associated with progression to HRV LRTI.",

However, at our institution data from transplant recipients is prospectively recorded in a central database, and we also conducted detailed chart review on every patient to obtain additional clinical data. Second, we captured both proven LRTI (HRV detected in the lower respiratory tract with abnormal imaging) and possible LRTI (HRV detected in the upper respiratory tract with abnormal imaging but no lower tract sampling). At our institution the use of BAL is based on standardized protocols outlining that BAL should be performed in HCT recipients with a respiratory virus detected in the upper respiratory tract and abnormal chest imaging. However, ultimately the need for BAL is determined by the attending physician, and thus some proven or probable cases (HRV detected in the lower respiratory tract without abnormal imaging) may have been missed. By including both proven and possible LRTI events (no probable events occurred), this effect is mitigated; however, proven LRTI may be the more relevant outcome given the mortality rates seen with proven HRV LRTI and the differences in outcomes observed in proven LRTI for PIV and RSV 3, 36, 37. Regardless, many institutions do not routinely use BAL for virologic confirmation, and thus our results for any LRTI events can be broadly applicable. Finally, our data include both allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients, and there may be a bias toward increased testing in the allogeneic group and therefore more LRTI events captured. However, the risk score performed reasonably well in the allogeneic subgroup.",

Because BAL was not done in possible LRTI cases, it is plausible that other pathogens are contributing to the radiographic changes, and thus these are not true LRTI events. However, as stated above, in clinical practice BAL is often not attempted, and co\u2013pathogen data are not available, yet patients are considered to have LRTI.
