In those studies, probability testing was usually done with Student\u2019s t test to evaluate the difference in daily mean symptom scores of infected subjects in the treated and placebo groups. This presents problems that go against good statistical practice. First, the intent-to-treat principle (and randomization) is compromised, since the results are analyzed only from infected and not from all virus-challenged subjects. Second, repeated measurements from the same person are in the data set. These measurements are correlated, and the statistical analysis must reflect this if valid inference is to be drawn. Finally, the severity of each patient\u2019s illness at the start of treatment influences the individual\u2019s response to treatment. Therefore, the severity of the patient\u2019s symptoms at the start of treatment must be taken into consideration in the data analysis. The statistical methods used in the current study were designed to effectively deal with these problems",

In subjects who were symptomatic when treatment was started, the full treatment resulted in a 33%\u201373% reduction in the daily mean total symptom severity score during the 4.5 days of treatment. The combination treatment was also well tolerated. Although nasal irritation occurs when intranasal IFN application is extended past several days [24], the abbreviated dosage schedule used in this study and in an earlier study [6] did not cause this problem. This dosage schedule was selected because of the prolonged antiviral state that IFN confers on nasal cells and the course of rhinovirus replication in the nose, which peaks at 48 h and then falls. Other antivirals would be candidates for use in combination therapy",

However, the symptom burden of rhinovirus and nonrhinovirus colds is greatest during the first 3 days of illness [25, 26]. Attacking symptoms after the cold is well developed is not an ideal strategy. A better strategy is to initiate treatment when the illness is first beginning and thus to prevent the symptom burden from ever reaching its peak. Early recognition of the onset of a cold appears to be practicable. In a study of patients with natural colds, 81% reported that the interval between the initial recognized symptom and when the patients \u201cknew they had a cold\u201d was \u2a7d16 h [27]. This suggests that most persons can recognize early cold symptoms and thus initiate early treatment. An additional benefit of early treatment in this study was the reduction of the amount of nasal fluid produced and the need for nose blowing. The full treatment reduced expelled nasal fluid volume by 71% and nasal tissue use by 55%. This may result in less nasal fluid being propelled into the sinuses by nose blowing [28]",
