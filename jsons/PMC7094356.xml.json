            "text": "Description Logics (DLs) [3] are a class of knowledge representation formalisms in the tradition of semantic networks and frames, which can be used to represent the terminological knowledge of an application domain in a structured and formally well-understood way. DL systems provide their users with inference services (like computing the subsumption hierarchy) that deduce implicit knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge. They are employed in various application domains, such as semantic Web [21], [39], ontologies [1], databases [6], [19], and software engineering [4]. Because classical DLs [3] can only represent and reason on certain or precise knowledge, and cannot represent and reason on uncertain or imprecise knowledge, therefore, some researchers extend classical DLs allowing to express uncertain or imprecise knowledge. At this aspect, three kinds of description logics, i.e., fuzzy DLs, probabilistic DLs, and rough DLs, are proposed.",

            "text": "In what follows, we will use several DLs, hence it is necessary to introduce some notations of DLs firstly. The DL that provides the Boolean concept constructors plus the existential and universal restriction constructors is called ALC\n[38], where the Boolean concept constructors are, apart from concept disjunction, concept conjunction and concept negation. In addition to the Booleans, and existential and universal restriction constructors, DLs typically provide concept constructors that form complex concepts. The basic constructors of this kind are qualified number restrictions, unqualified number restrictions, functional number restrictions, nominals, concrete domain [3]. More expressive DLs can be obtained by extending ALC with new concept constructors. For example, the logic obtained from ALC by providing qualified number restrictions is called ALCQ. On the other hand, adding unqualified, functional number restrictions, nominals, and concrete domains to ALC results in the logics ALCN, ALCF, ALCO, and ACL(D), respectively. Furthermore, besides concept constructors, DLs may provide a set of role constructors such as inversion and transitive closure operator. The logics that extend ALC with inversion and transitive closure operator are called ALCI and ALC\n+, respectively. In ALC the RBox is required to be empty. Therefore, one way to provide new useful expressivity is to allow different sorts of axioms such as transitivity axioms and role inclusion axioms in the RBox. The extensions of ALC with transitive roles and role inclusion axioms are called ALCR\n+ and ALCH, respectively. The logic ALCHR\n+ is commonly known as SH. The different extensions of SH are commonly denoted by appending the corresponding calligraphic letter (I for role inversion, O for nominals, D for concrete domains, F, N, Q for functional, unqualified and qualified number restrictions, respectively) to the name of the logic. For instance, the extension of SH with inverse roles, nominals, qualified number restrictions and concrete domains is known as SHOIQ(D).",

            "text": "In rough description logic RDL\n[37], for every concept C\u2208RDL, the corresponding lower approximation C_ and upper approximation C\u00af also are concepts of RDL, i.e., C_, C\u00af\u2208RDL. Moreover, C_ and C\u00af are two different separate concepts, that is to say, C_ and C\u00af are not be integrated into a uniform approximate concept \u3008C_,C\u00af\u3009. However, it is well-known that when it is impossible to formally define a concept C, we can often make use of the approximations (the lower approximation C_ and the upper approximation C\u00af) together, i.e., approximate concept (or rough set) \u3008C_,C\u00af\u3009, to express the concept C in a precise way with explicit formal semantics, in other words, only single lower approximation C_ or upper approximation C\u00af cannot express the concept C in a precise way. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a kind of new reasoning algorithm of rough description logics based on approximate concepts (not single lower approximation or upper approximation). On the other hand, approximate concept corresponds to the notion of rough set in rough set theory [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], as a uniform concept, approximate concept is applied in ontologies, i.e., approximate concepts based approximate ontologies are presented [8]. It is well-known that description logics are the logic foundations of Web ontology language [2], i.e., the Web ontology languages are equivalent to description logics in theory. For example, the Web ontology language OWL Lite and OWL DL have a formal semantics and a reasoning support through a mapping to the expressive description logics SHIF(D) and SHOIN(D), respectively, [13]. Comparing with the classical ontologies [10], there exist same problem in approximate ontologies [8]: what are the logic foundations (or reasoning algorithms) of approximate ontologies? Naturally, we also need a kind of reasoning algorithm of rough description logics based on approximate concepts. That is to say, approximate concepts must be introduced to description logics from a theoretical point of view. The present work may be considered as an attempt in this direction.",

DLs have a well-defined model-theoretic semantics, and the last two decades the computational properties of a wide variety of DLs have been studied.

            "text": "Approximate concepts (or rough sets) based rough description logic RDLAC is not restricted to a particular classical description logic, and will be defined for an arbitrary description logic. For the sake of simplicity, we restrict ourselves to classical description logic ALC\n[38] in the following. That is to say, rough description logic RDLAC is a rough extension of classical description logic ALC. Therefore, the syntax of RDLAC is the extension of the syntax of ALC, i.e., RDLAC concepts (denoted by C or D, possibly with a subscript) are composed inductively according to the following abstract syntax:C,D\u2192\u22a4|\u22a5|A|\u00acC|C\u2293D|C\u2294D|\u2203R\u00b7C|\u2200R\u00b7C|C\u00af|C_|,where A denotes atomic concept, C and D denote concepts, R denotes role name.Example 1Sepsis Example [37]Sepsis is a disease in which the immune system of the patient overreacts to an infection. Due to this reaction the patient becomes severely ill, which easily results in organ failure and eventually death. The cause and underlying cellular pathways of this disease are unclear, which hinders the precise characterization of the sepsis patient. Therefore, a consensus definition of sepsis was established in 1992 to define several stages of sepsis [5]. This definition does not provide a precise definition of sepsis, but gives the criteria for which there was a consensus that they should at least hold for a patient with sever sepsis. These criteria are called as Bone criteria. Patients who accord with Bone criteria may have sepsis, however, this is not necessarily the case. We refer to these patients as being possibly septic. On the other hand, we can define a group of patients that are septic for sure, namely those who fulfill the Bone criteria and have severe multiple organ failure. We refer to these patients as the definitely septic patients and define them as fulfilling the strict criteria.The following concepts all are concepts of RDLAC:Septic_,Septic\u00af,\u2203diag\u00b7Septic\u00af,\u2203diag\u00b7Septic_\u00af,\u2200diag\u00b7(Septic_\u222a\u00acSeptic_)_.For any concept C of RDLAC, the pair \u3008C_,C\u00af\u3009 is called approximate concept w.r.t. C. For example, \u3008Septic_,Septic\u00af\u3009 is an approximate concept w.r.t. Septic. In fact, an approximate concept corresponds to the notion of rough set in rough set theory [31], [32], [33], [34], [35].\nExample 2SARS ExampleSevere acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS for short) is a respiratory disease in humans which is caused by the SARS coronavirus. The definition of SARS can not be expressed precisely. According to the clinic diagnosis criteria for SARS which was released by the Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China [25], there are mainly two kinds of diagnosis criteria for SARS: suspected diagnostic criteria and clinically diagnosed criteria. Obviously, the patients who accord with suspected diagnostic criteria may have SARS, however, this is not necessary the case. Here, we can define the patients who accord with suspected diagnostic criteria as the upper approximation concept of SARS (denoted by SARS\u00af). The patients who accord with clinically diagnosed criteria must have SARS. Here, we can define the patients who accord with clinically diagnosed criteria as the lower approximation concept of SARS (denoted by SARS_). Therefore, the approximate concept SARS is a pair \u3008SARS_,SARS\u00af\u3009, namely, SARS=\u3008SARS_,SARS\u00af\u3009. Based on the approximate concept \u3008SARS_,SARS\u00af\u3009, we can further construct the description logic knowledge base about SARS in a precise way with explicit formal semantics.\n",

Subsumption reasoning instead of implication reasoning is often studied. In fact, subsumption reasoning is a special case of implication reasoning.(2)If we consider the implication w.r.t. a rough TBox TB in RDLAC, the implication (entailment) can be defined as follows:A rough TBox TB entails a rough inclusion AC\u2291AD (denoted by TB\u22a8AC\u2291AD) iff every rough model of TB also satisfies AC\u2291AD.It is easy to know that the entailment in RDLAC is similar to that of fuzzy DLs [41], [42].(3)Of course, we may study the Heyting implication between approximate concepts in RDLAC (this case is similar to the 3-valued Lukasiewicz implication in the case of rough sets). However, in this case, the approximate concept satisfiability is complicated. In particular, things become more complicated when other relations than equivalence relation are considered or when intuitionist (Heyting) implication is defined between approximate concepts in RDLAC. We will study this issue in other paper in detail.\n\n",

Obviously, any concept of RDL can be translated into an approximate concept of RDLAC.\n",

This can be shown by contradiction. Assume there exists a rough model I=(\u0394I,R\u223c,\u2022I) of TB, and an individual x\u2208\u0394I, such that (1) x\u2208(C_)I, and x\u2209(D_)I; or (2) x\u2208(C\u00af)I, and x\u2209(D\u00af)I.(1)Assume that x\u2208(C_)I, and x\u2209(D_)I. Since x\u2209(D_)I, then we have x\u2208\u0394I\u29f9(D_)I=(\u00acD_)I. Since x\u2208(C_)I, we obtain x\u2208(C_)I\u2229(\u00acD_)I=(C_\u2293\u00acD_)I. Therefore (C_\u2293\u00acD_)I\u2260\u03d5. This is an obvious contradiction to (C_\u2293\u00acD_)I=\u03d5. Thus, our assumption is refuted.(2)Assume that x\u2208(C\u00af)I, and x\u2209(D\u00af)I. Since x\u2209(D\u00af)I, then we have x\u2208\u0394I\u29f9(D\u00af)I=(\u00acD\u00af)I. Since x\u2208(C\u00af)I, we obtain x\u2208(C\u00af)I\u2229(\u00acD\u00af)I=(C\u00af\u2293\u00acD\u00af)I. Therefore (C\u00af\u2293\u00acD\u00af)I\u2260\u03d5. This is an obvious contradiction to (C\u00af\u2293\u00acD\u00af)I=\u03d5. Thus, our assumption is refuted.This completes the proof of Theorem 5. \u25a1\n\n",

Therefore, the approximate concept satisfiability reasoning and approximate concepts rough subsumption reasoning w.r.t. rough TBox in RDLAC can be implemented by utilizing the tableaux reasoning algorithm in ALC. That is to say, the approximate concept satisfiability reasoning and approximate concepts rough subsumption reasoning w.r.t. rough TBox in RDLAC can be reasoned by utilizing the description logics reasoning systems which have been implemented, such as Pellet [40], FaCT++ [44], and Racer [11]. From the definition of the translation function \u2022t, translating the approximate concepts or rough TBox in RDLAC into concepts or TBox in ALC, respectively, can be carried out in polynomial time, so the complexity of reasoning in RDLAC is the same as that of the ALC.Remark 4\nRDLAC, the extension to standard DLs such as ALC\n[38] that we introduce in this paper, allows for precise modeling of vague knowledge using approximate concepts. Technically, RDLAC can be simulated with (almost) standard ALC without added expressiveness. In other words, our RDLAC is strictly speaking not more expressive than classical DLs such as ALC, i.e., the classical DLs are strong enough to cope with notions arising from rough approximations, but the approximate concepts that we introduce are useful modeling devices for uncertain or imprecise knowledge (namely non-crisp concepts) such as Sepsis and SARS (see Section 3.1).\n",

The works of Schlobach are integrating knowledge mining algorithms based on Pawlak rough set theory and knowledge representation method based on modal and description logics, i.e., Schlobach does not present rough description logics.",

Specifically, a formal framework for defining approximate concepts, ontologies and operations on approximate concepts and ontologies is presented, and algorithms for automatically generating approximate ontologies from traditional crisp ontologies or from data sets together with additional knowledge is presented. However, Doherty\u2019s work (which is perhaps the one closest in spirit to our own), is not based on logics (or description logics), so their semantics is non-standard, and approximate concepts are not be integrated in standard ontology language such as description logics. The works described in this paper introduce approximate concepts to description logics based on rough set theory from a theoretical point of view.",

To this direction approximate concepts are introduced to description logics based on rough set theory, a kind of new rough description logic RDLAC is proposed based on approximate concepts. The syntax, semantics, properties and reasoning problems of the RDLAC are given. Interestingly, we allow approximate concepts to appear in a rough description logic knowledge base. Although our rough description logic RDLAC is strictly speaking not more expressive than classical DLs such as ALC, the approximate concepts that we introduce are useful modeling devices for uncertain or imprecise knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, the work described in this paper is the first result about integration between description logics and approximate concepts. Therefore, theoretical foundations for reasoning algorithms of more expressive rough description logics including approximate concepts, number restrictions, nominals, inverse roles and role hierarchies are provided by the RDLAC. As far as future directions are concerned, these will include the approximate concept satisfiability and approximate concepts rough subsumption reasoning algorithms of rough description logics including number restrictions, nominals, inverse roles and role hierarchies, and an integration between approximate concepts and fuzzy DLs [17], [41], [42] or probabilistic DLs [12], [28] based on fuzzy rough set theory [27], [30], [43], [50], [51] or probabilistic rough set theory [7], [45], [52], respectively. Furthermore, additional research effort can be focused on the investigation of the construction of approximate ontologies (or rough TBoxes) using formal concept analysis.",
