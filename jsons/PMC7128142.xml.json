            "text": "Vaccines are probably the most efficacious public health tools of the 20th Century having greatly reduced both morbidity and mortality from viral diseases across the globe. Today, vaccination against viral disease moves to confront the challenges of emerging infections that are caused by pathogens with little known biology and associated with unpredictable impact on our societies. Moreover, the field still needs to address the massive disease burden from chronic infections caused by viruses that already know the tricks to efficiently evade the human immune system. New insights into the immune correlates of protection from viral diseases and into the vaccine prerequisites for the rational induction of safe and broadly protective immune responses offer promising chances for highly innovative vaccine development. Important aims include the availability of vaccines that can be rapidly produced and delivered to provide protection against emerging or re-emerging viruses. The induction of potent but balanced innate responses upon vaccination holds great promise to overcome the malfunctioning immune defense in chronic infections. The recent advances in vaccine research demonstrate the feasibility to test a wide range of candidate vaccines \u2014 including genetically engineered live viruses \u2014 in preclinical proof-of-principle studies and in clinical trials in humans.",
