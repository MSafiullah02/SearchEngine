A costing model was developed on the basis of disease prevalence, current or projected consumption of medicines, and international reference prices. Using two consumption scenarios, the Commission estimated that between US$77\u00b74 and $151\u00b79 billion (or $13 to $25 per capita) is required to finance a basic package of 201 essential medicines (378 dosage forms) in all LMICs. Yet in 2010, the majority of low-income countries (LICs) and 13 out of 47 middle-income countries, spent less than $13 per capita on pharmaceuticals. Thus, the Commission confirmed that many people worldwide do not have access to even a limited basket of essential medicines. Countries should adapt the Commission's model to their national contexts to create a locally relevant estimate as a benchmark for measuring performance on essential medicines.

Governments need to define a list of missing essential medicines to be provided under UHC schemes, and governments, non-governmental organisations, and the industry need to make the necessary R&D financing mechanisms available for these identified needs. The price of new essential medicines can then be delinked from development costs and the products can be made widely available and affordable through non-exclusive licensing agreements.

Affordability of medicines has become a key issue for governments, as well as public and private payers for health care, regardless of a country's income level.

            "text": "Simultaneously, although these polices affect the prevention and treatment of many diseases, essential medicines are rarely presented at the centre of the global health agenda. Instead, all too often essential medicines policies are incorrectly regarded as a technical side issue for which answers are known and easily applied. In this report, the Commission argues that essential medicines pose a central challenge to the sustainable development agenda, demanding creative and bold action. As an example, the Commission presents the case of new essential medicines for treating hepatitis C (panel 2\n). This case illustrates that essential medicines policies are relevant for all countries regardless of income level, and that the five challenges are closely related.Panel 2New essential medicines to treat hepatitis C virus infectionThe marketing of new treatments for hepatitis C virus infection in the past 5 years and the current global debate on equitable access to such treatment have placed effective policies for essential medicines at the centre stage of global health. Details of the case succinctly illustrate each of the five key challenges of essential medicines policies presented in this report: paying for essential medicines, making treatment affordable, assuring quality and safety, promoting quality use, and developing new essential medicines. The case also illustrates how these five challenges are interconnected, and how they are equally relevant for high-income and low-income countries alike.Up to 184 million people globally are living with hepatitis C virus infection.18 The newly developed medicines, known as direct-acting antiviral medicines (DAAs), have dramatically improved the efficacy and safety of hepatitis C treatment, offering substantial improvements in quality of life and longevity. WHO has developed a global strategy for the treatment and elimination of viral hepatitis,19 and added four DAAs\u2014daclatasvir, dasabuvir, simeprevir, and sofosbuvir\u2014to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines in 2015.20 Overall response rates are substantially higher than with previously used first-line regimens, although the efficacy of DAAs varies with viral genotype.21 National governments and other health-care payers worldwide are now working to scale up access to these medicines to all people living with hepatitis C virus infection.\nPaying for DAAs\nThe most prominent question being debated is how to pay for DAAs, which are extremely costly. Directly related to this question is the need to estimate how much treatment will cost for each specific population. This estimate is in itself a major challenge, since pricing of the new DAAs varies widely among countries and also sometimes within countries.22 For example, it has been estimated that treating all eligible patients in the USA with DAAs would require an additional US$65 billion over the course of 5 years.23 Some US insurance plans offer treatment, but many restrict access to particular subsets of patients with hepatitis C virus infection (based on, for example, severity of illness or likelihood of benefiting from treatment). The high price of sofosbuvir (with a list price of about $84 000 for a full course of treatment) prompted an investigation by the US Senate Committee on Finance; it revealed that even though Medicare spent more than $1 billion on the medicine in 2014, less than 2\u00b74% of patients with hepatitis C virus infection enrolled in Medicare had received treatment.24 The budget implications of paying for DAAs as part of a basic health-care package are tremendous in high-income countries; the budget implications in health systems with far fewer resources are even more daunting.\nMaking DAAs affordable\nAffordability of DAAs is a major global challenge, and is also widely debated. For example, in 2015, sofosbuvir was licensed in Malaysia where hepatitis C virus infection prevalence is estimated at 2\u00b75% of people aged 15\u201364 years, mostly among men.25 However, sofosbuvir remains unaffordable for patients and the government alike, with a price set at about $87 430 for a 24-week course.26 Malaysia is considered an upper-middle-income country,27 with a gross domestic product per capita of $11 307 in 2014\u2014far less than the cost of a single treatment course.28 Pricing has little to do with production cost; for sofosbuvir, production is estimated to cost between $68 and $136 for a 12-week treatment course.29 The medicine is sold in India for $500,29 and after Egypt introduced local production of the medicine, the price there dropped to about $330.30 Thus, there is ample scope for price reductions in Malaysia and elsewhere, but achieving them requires concerted effort to implement a range of policies to promote affordability. Prices are expected to fall for the production of sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination tablet, and the recently registered tablet sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for sale in 101 low-income and middle-income countries, following Gilead Sciences Inc's signing of voluntary licence agreements with 11 Indian generics companies in 2014.31 The Medicines Patent Pool also offers a licence for daclatasvir for sale in 112 low-income and middle-income countries.32\n\nAssuring quality and safety of DAAs\nMitigating the risk of substandard and falsified DAAs entering supply chains and reaching patients is necessary; quality and safety concerns highlight the need for affordable quality-assured treatments. In March 2016, a non-governmental organisation in Myanmar reported it had identified two falsified products, one claiming to contain 400 mg sofosbuvir + 90 mg ledipasvir, and the other 60 mg daclatasvir.33 The manufacturer listed on the packaging has never produced the combination, nor was it currently producing 60 mg daclatasvir. Lack of access to treatment attracts criminal entities that exploit people's health needs. Other falsified DAAs have been found in Israel,34 and Pakistan's regulatory authorities have identified factories making counterfeit versions.35 Falsified medicines endanger patients' health and undermine trust in legitimate medicines manufacturers. The best way to counter the supply of falsified and substandard medicines is to ensure the availability of affordable, quality-assured essential medicines.\nPromoting quality use of DAAs\nSubstantial risks can also result from inappropriate use of DAAs, leading to operational challenges in expanding access to DAA. Appropriate selection of a DAA-containing regimen requires previous identification of the viral genotype. Inappropriate use of DAAs leads to unnecessary costs; furthermore, the high prices of DAAs might lead to partial courses of treatment or other forms of underuse as patients try to cut expenses. Test-and-treat strategies, short-course fixed-dose combinations, and pan-genotypic regimens can promote quality use.\nDeveloping DAAs\nSofosbuvir, the DAA that forms the backbone of most treatment regimens, was developed initially at an academic institution with US federal research funding. However, because neither universities nor governments have the operational capacity to move a new medicine into production, the discovery was sold first to a small biotech company and then to the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Inc, which bought the biotech company for $11\u00b72 billion. Private investment in the development of the drug is estimated at no more than $200 million.36 Within 1 year of introducing the medicine, Gilead Sciences Inc had recouped the initial expenditure of $11\u00b72 billion; the patent will not expire before 2024. This situation limits the downward pressure on prices created by a competitive generic market, although other DAAs might exert some competitive price pressure.",

            "text": "The first international conference on essential medicines policies, the Nairobi Conference on the Rational Use of Drugs (panel 3\n), was held in 1985. The resulting 1986 World Health Assembly resolution on the Revised Drugs Strategy (WHO, unpublished) represented a major milestone. It laid the foundation for many subsequent international policies related to essential medicines, including procurement, supply, prescribing and dispensing of medicines, and the regulation of promotional practices. 30 years after Nairobi, essential medicines has become a widely accepted public policy concept.52\nPanel 3The Nairobi Conference of Experts on the Rational Use of Drugs\nEarly initiatives on essential medicines\n*\nCuba (1963) was probably the first country to introduce a list of basic medicines.38 Maurice King's revolutionary 1966 book, which included the first international checklist of basic medicines,39 was followed by the introduction of national lists in Tanzania in 1970,40 and Peru in 1972.41 The first WHO Model List of 212 essential drugs was published in 1977.37 In 1978, the Declaration of Alma Ata included the provision of essential medicines as the eighth component of primary health care.The concept of essential medicines proposed by WHO immediately drew mixed reactions. The Lancet called the selection \u201cdesert-island drugs\u201d but recommended applying a similar approach in developed countries.42 Consumer activists supported the concept as a way to reduce unbridled promotion of unnecessary and harmful medicines. The pharmaceutical industry argued that restricting prescribers' free choice of medicines would lead to a deterioration of health care. When the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs was established in 1982, the pharmaceutical industry feared that WHO, under pressure from consumer groups, would develop an international code on pharmaceutical marketing.43\n\nConference of Experts on the Rational Use of Drugs\n44\nThe 1984 World Health Assembly (WHA), led by Nordic countries and the Netherlands, asked WHO Director-General Halfdan Mahler to organise a global meeting to discuss the rational use of medicines. The term rational use reflected the view that medicine-related problems went beyond logistics, but were also driven by uncontrolled pharmaceutical markets. WHO kept the participant list secret before the meeting to prevent lobbying, and asked participants not to divulge the background papers. At the opening, Mahler reminded participants that they were invited as experts, not as stakeholder representatives.A central theme of the conference was the need to restrict marketing of medicines to those that were essential. The meeting stated that any national medicines policy should ensure that medicines of acceptable quality, safety, and efficacy were available at affordable costs to all who needed them. WHO was charged with disseminating guidelines on the development and implementation of national medicines policies. Much discussion focused on making medicine information more objective and accessible; the conference agreed that governments were responsible for regulating pharmaceutical marketing and advertising. There was sharp disagreement over the universality of rationalisation, and whether it should apply to both the public and private sectors, in the interests of public health.In summing up the conference, Mahler concluded that the experts had invited WHO to take a leadership role without becoming a supranational manipulator of governments, and suggested that WHO establish expert committees to produce guidelines on ethical advertising and developing national medicines policies.\nThe Revised Drug Strategy\nThe WHA subsequently adopted a Revised Drug Strategy on the basis of Mahler's summary in 1986. Neither industry nor consumers could oppose it, since their experts had accepted Mahler's conclusions in Nairobi. Yet the WHA meeting was highly politicised, with an industry exhibition and press centre, and a problem drugs pack issued by Health Action International. The USA actively lobbied against WHO's proposed role in regulating the operations of the pharmaceutical industry in developing countries.43\nIn 1986, the USA failed to pay its assessed contribution to WHO, largely because of its dissatisfaction with WHO's activities in the pharmaceutical area following Nairobi.45 The Revised Drug Strategy has guided WHO's work since, but no further global conference on essential medicines has been held.\nImplementation and the long-term impact of the Nairobi recommendations\nFor over two decades after Nairobi, international donors (particularly the Netherlands and the Nordic countries) gave extensive financial and political support to WHO's Action Programme. Just before Mahler completed his term of office in 1988, WHO issued the Ethical Criteria for Medicinal Drug Promotion.46 Initially seen as a weak compromise, this publication has stood the test of time. That year, WHO also published the first Guidelines for Developing National Drug Policies.47 An updated version has remained in wide use since 2001.48 WHO strengthened the standard format for exchanging regulatory information and intensified its support to national regulatory agencies, ultimately leading to the WHO/UN Prequalification Programme in 2001. Rational use activities were started, such as developing Drug Use Indicators, published in 1992,49 the Guide to Good Prescribing in 1994,50 and many international training courses that have been instrumental in preparing a new generation of international experts.Following the Nairobi Conference, WHO extensively supported most low-income and middle-income countries in developing and implementing national medicine policies. By 2013, more than 90% of low-income and middle-income countries had formulated a first list of essential medicines and published a national medicines policy (Figure 1, Figure 2).30 years after Nairobi, essential medicines has become a widely accepted concept against which few can argue. Over the years, WHO has been encouraged and supported by an increasingly professional consumer movement consistently advocating for more decisive action.51\n",

Examples include anti-infectives (such as mebendazole, ivermectin, ampicillin, and doxycycline), analgesics (aspirin and paracetamol), antimalarials (chloroquine and primaquine), oral rehydration solution, and childhood vaccines. This emphasis aligned with the movement for selective primary health care that was strongly championed in the 1990s.55 This movement had emerged as a response to the problem of facing enormous unmet medical needs with limited resources. Selective primary health care focused on delivering a restricted range of first-contact services with high cost-effectiveness in LMICs, and emphasised maternal and child health services. It did not directly address health system structures needed for chronic communicable and non-communicable conditions, particularly the emerging burden of HIV. Instead, the emphasis of essential medicines policies in this era was on efficiency (by prioritising low-cost and cost-effective treatments) and equity (by emphasising treatments for diseases associated with poverty).56\n",

These include supply chain management, from sourcing raw materials to delivery of final products to consumers; the role of local production of pharmaceuticals; the problem of falsified medicines; promoting adherence; and prevention of medication errors. Since other global efforts address these issues, the Commission decided not to analyse them in depth. However, this decision should not be taken to mean that they deserve less attention, or that all possible remedial actions are already in place. Particularly, achieving UHC will require substantial investment in strengthening supply chains for all health commodities, including essential medicines. An effective, integrated supply chain for medicines will demand good data visibility, a willingness to learn from and leverage the private sector, strong national stewardship, a committed and supported workforce, a focus on continuous improvement, and proactive risk management. Finally, and more generally, the Commission primarily approached essential medicines policies from the policy and academic viewpoints of independent experts on the basis of analysis of the best available evidence. The Commission did not seek to represent the possible viewpoints of all stakeholders.",

The pharmacist tells her that stock-outs happen frequently at this time of the year, since the hospital's annual medicine budget from the government is exhausted. She is advised to buy the inhaler from a private pharmacy instead. However, because her family does not have enough money to buy the medicine from the local pharmacy, Priti decides instead to wait until the hospital's stocks are replenished. Within a few days, however, she suffers a major asthma attack and has to be admitted to hospital. Her family must borrow money to pay the in-patient hospital fees.",

Moving towards UHC requires countries to reduce medicines financing via direct payment and to increase financing through required prepayment mechanisms and government allocation.3The international community must fulfil its human rights obligations to support governments of LICs in financing a basic package of essential medicines for all, if they are unable to do so domestically. This support should come in addition to similar support programmes already in operation for essential medicines for specific diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected diseases. The Commission urges countries to review innovative financing mechanisms to determine whether they can be extended to apply to essential medicines generally.4Governments and national health systems must invest in the capacity to accurately track expenditure on medicines, especially essential medicines, in both the public and private sectors. Data should be disaggregated between prepaid and out-of-pocket expenditure, and among important key populations. Informed decision making on investments in the purchase of essential medicines requires quality data on current spending. Since national-level data can obscure important inequities, data need to be disaggregated for important key populations, chosen with the particular national situation in mind. In designing monitoring systems, attention must also be paid to enabling maximal involvement of all stakeholders and to the principles of transparency, including access to the data for use by policy analysts and academics. Transparency will facilitate public buy-in and support for the decision-making processes that use such data.\n",

Affordability is also distinct from the value of a product or service.

However, these data are limited and rapidly become out of date. In the 2015 World Health Statistics report, only 38 (19\u00b76%) of 194 countries had survey results generated between 2007 and 2013.139 The only datapoints reported were minimum, median, and maximum values for the availability of generic medicines, and the median consumer price ratio (compared with international reference prices) of selected generic medicines in the public and private sectors. Although the WHO/HAI cross-sectional survey method136 has been validated, it remains subject to limitations in terms of sampling, facilities, and the basket of medicines assessed.140 Very few countries have done repeated price surveys, while data on affordability by income strata are not available. Routine data are easier to collect from single-payer and state-operated systems, but data obtained from distributors or retailers have limitations. Such data are often out of date because of price fluctuations, and do not reflect undisclosed discounts, clawbacks, or other types of price reductions. Routine collection of data on the actual prices paid by patients for medicines rarely occurs, especially in settings in which out-of-pocket payments are common and the prices paid are highly variable. The International Drug Price Indicator Guide issued by Management Sciences for Health addresses this gap to a certain extent, by reporting sellers' and buyers' prices from government agencies, pharmaceutical suppliers, and international development organisations. Other price reporting mechanisms have been developed for specific medicines, such as antiretrovirals and tuberculosis treatments.141, 142, 143\n",

Although little conclusive evidence exists that transparency alone results in price reductions, the possibility has been raised that price transparency could enable collusion or other anticompetitive behaviours between companies154 or in an attempt to limit price reductions.

TRIPS also includes a range of flexibilities that provide governments with options that allow for the protection of public health, including access to affordable medicines (section 5). Widespread use of these flexibilities has been key, for example, in the supply of generic antiretrovirals.167 However, these flexibilities are under continual threat from the TRIPS-plus obligations included in bilateral and regional trade agreements. For example, data exclusivity provisions require each manufacturer of generic or biosimilar medicines to generate its own data for applications to regulatory authorities for market authorisation\u2014for many, this requirement becomes an insurmountable barrier.168 Furthermore, it raises ethical concerns when a standard of care has already been established.

            "text": "A 2014 World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA67.23)190 noted the prerequisites necessary to implement HTA begin with an independent body, free from political pressure and other vested interests in medicines policy. Engagement with stakeholders, such as academic institutions and professional associations, is also needed. HTA often requires the creation of new capacity at the national level. Finally, substantial and sustained financial investment is needed to provide for the resources needed to undertake HTA. For example, in 2008 the Korean National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency had around 120 staff, a budget of $10 million, and completed 90 HTAs (of which 59 were done in-house).191\nPanel 5\nreviews these prerequisites using the example of the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program, the national agency performing and supporting HTAs in Thailand.Panel 5The Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) of ThailandThailand's experience demonstrates how health technology assessment (HTA) can be successfully used as a tool for developing and implementing policies that reduce the prices of essential medicines and technologies.In 2007, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand established HITAP to generate evidence to inform decision making about which medicines and health technologies would be covered by the public health system.192 By 2015, HITAP had 50 staff, and a budget of approximately US$2 million per year. The assessment process used by HITAP is presented in appendix 2.2. HITAP does between 20 and 25 assessments per year.Four crucial features have enabled Thailand to effectively use HTA to make medicines more affordable:\n\u2022Independence from decision making about reimbursement: HITAP does not make decisions on the inclusion of a medicine in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), the Thai public health system's reimbursement list. Instead, its expert assessments are provided to relevant government authorities. The link between technical assessment and reimbursement decisions should be transparent and clearly defined.193\n\u2022Compensating for a shortage of in-house HTA capacity: in Thailand, most HTAs are done either by HITAP or by other public research institutes. On lower priority topics, the NLEM Subcommittee allows HTA submissions from industry, provided they follow national guidelines. This action allows HITAP to allocate scarce technical resources to high priority assessments.\u2022Using price quotations as an input for HTA and a trigger for pricing interventions: HTAs in Thailand go beyond consideration of the existing price of a product in the local market. Manufacturers and marketers of medicines under HTA consideration might submit price quotations that reflect the economies of scale that would follow if the product is deemed reimbursable. Additionally, if the HTA shows that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio exceeds a certain threshold\u2014approximately US$5000 (160 000 Thai Baht) per quality-adjusted life-year or disability-adjusted life-year\u2014then price negotiations ensue to reach a price that is acceptable for all parties. Thus, the Thai HTA process has led to the activation of price interventions aimed at ensuring the affordability of essential medicines (see also panel 6).\u2022Using HTA as an input for budgetary impact consideration: no health system has an unlimited budget; there will always be tensions between ensuring availability of cost-effective essential medicines and securing the means to meet the cost of such medicines. Demonstrating cost-effectiveness, even on the basis of locally-relevant thresholds, values, and preferences, is not sufficient to ensure that a medicine is affordable for either the health system or patients. For example, a Thai HTA concluded that reimbursing screening-plus-treatment for osteoporosis at any age was not cost-effective.195 Even if the acquisition price of the medicine being assessed, alendronate, were to be reduced by 40%, it was projected that it would comprise almost 20% of the UHC scheme's budget if included.\n",

An initial HTA had shown that FOLFOX would be considered cost-effective compared with the alternative (adjuvant therapy with folinic acid, 5-fluoruoracil, and capecitabine), but only if the price of oxaliplatin were reduced by at least 40%. A final price reduction of 70% was negotiated, which has saved the Thai health system approximately US$4\u00b775 million (152 million Thai Baht) per year.\u2022Off-label use: in 2012, the Thai NLEM confirmed a decision to include intravitreal bevacizumab, rather than ranibizumab, for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. Although bevcizumab had been used off-label, concerns were raised after such use was challenged in the UK.194 An HTA done by the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program concluded that the two medicines were equivalent in terms of effectiveness, but noted that safety data were insufficiently robust. A multi-stakeholder process, including ophthalmologists, academics, and representatives from the Thai Food and Drug Administration and pharmaceutical industry, recommended that negotiations commence with the producer of ranibizumab to reduce the price, but in the event that these price negotiations failed, bevacizumab will be included in the NLEM (with development of a system for monitoring serious adverse effects).\u2022Cost-sharing arrangement: although an HTA of imiglucerase for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease showed the product not to be cost-effective, a cost-sharing model was negotiated, which allowed the product to be included on the NLEM in 2012. For the first five patients newly identified each year, costs were to be shared equally by the manufacturer and government (an effective price reduction of 50%), and for subsequent patients identified in the same year, the manufacturer would cover the entire cost of treatment.\n",

Trastuzumab posed an existential challenge to the health technology assessment process in England and Wales.In the face of an initial rejection by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the UK health secretary intervened to force reimbursement by a primary care trust in 2005.199 In 2010, the Cancer Drugs Fund was formed specifically to \u201chelp patients get access to innovative new cancer drugs.\u201d200 A follow-on formulation, trastuzumab emtansine (sold as Kadcyla by Roche), for the treatment of HER2-positive locally advanced or unresectable, or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, was initially funded by the Cancer Drugs Fund but was scheduled to be withdrawn in November 2015. This reversal provoked fierce responses from cancer groups, including a request to the UK Government to issue a compulsory licence to allow a lower priced version of the product.201 The product remains available through the Cancer Drugs Fund after an agreement between the manufacturer and National Health Service in England was reached.202 However, the Cancer Drugs Fund was not considered to be a long-term solution, and it was replaced by the Managed Access Fund.203, 204\nSustainability lies in lower pricing of medicines considered essential. Political response to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee's rejection of trastuzumab also resulted in the creation of a unique funding programme in Australia in 2001.205 In 2015, trastuzumab was added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, together with several other expensive cancer treatments and all of the currently available direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus infection.20 That step was only the first in the process of ensuring equitable access to all who need these essential medicines.206\n",

Commentators have argued that the HTA method is promoted by donor agencies but inadequately adapted or used by national governments or decision makers. Therefore, they warn that HTA should be applied only with great caution.210 Given these limitations and challenges, it seems crucial to identify the areas where HTA can make the greatest contribution to decision making and where there is need for other existing or innovative tools.",

For instance, a review of reimbursement decisions in 14 OECD countries found that both the severity and the rarity of a condition were used to justify higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios or higher prices than would be the norm.217 Balancing the various considerations and justifications that could be used in such decisions highlights the necessity of explicitly defining ethical principles to guide the use of economic analyses in the selection of medicines.",

Countries moving towards UHC have an opportunity to respond to the needs of payers for quality price information for procurement and reimbursement decisions. Simultaneously, countries should measure their progress on providing affordable medicines. Monitoring systems should inform decision making about the need for interventions on medicines price and affordability. Monitoring systems also need to include regular surveys to obtain data disaggregated by economic status, rural or urban setting, sex, and other key population groups.2Governments must implement a comprehensive set of policies to achieve affordable prices for essential medicines. Countries moving towards UHC should consider using pricing policies that leverage large buyer power, setting a reimbursement limit by reference, and creating incentives for prescribers and patients such as reimbursement caps or copayments when appropriate. Policies to address high prices of generic essential medicines might require a different set of policies from essential medicines under patent protection. The full range of medicines pricing policy interventions must be employed to ensure the affordability of essential medicines for individuals and populations, including exempting medicines from taxes and tariffs, pro-generic policies in the case of multi-source products, and the use of TRIPS flexibilities in the case of single-source products. To protect a wide range of policy options, countries should abstain from demanding or agreeing to TRIPS-plus provisions in trade agreements.3Governments and health systems must develop national capacity to create medicines benefit packages that guide procurement and reimbursement for affordable essential medicines. This development requires building capacity to identify where health technology assessments can make the greatest contribution to decision making, translate findings of these assessments to the local context, and use the findings as inputs in decision making (including to help identify instances for governments to intervene in relation to medicine pricing).4Governments, national health systems, and the pharmaceutical industry must promote transparency by sharing health and medicines information. Globally and regionally, countries and health systems must participate in transparent sharing of information on pricing, evidence for comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness estimates, or other economic assessment of technologies, budget impact assessments, and the outcomes of pricing interventions. Sharing promotes efficiency by avoiding duplication, enabling countries with lower resources to use and adapt assessment of medicines (and other health technologies) according to their needs.\n",

            "text": "A 2011 survey (Hall P, Concept Foundation, unpublished) assessed the capacity of manufacturers of oral contraceptives to produce good-quality products. All 44 generic manufacturers in the LMICs surveyed were declared to be in compliance with national good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. Yet less than a third of the manufacturing plants met global GMP requirements set by either WHO or the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (jointly abbreviated as PIC/S). Local GMP requirements might be distinct from WHO or PIC/S requirements; non-global GMP requirements does not mean, by default, that the products are poor quality. However, WHO and PIC/S set global standards that aim to ensure quality and safety. Another survey,231 on the quality of misoprostol in 15 MICs, showed that only 119 (55\u00b73%) of 215 products contained the correct quantity of active ingredient; 14 (7%) of 215 did not contain any and were probably falsified (panel 9\n).Panel 9Widespread quality problems with misoprostol, a life-saving medicine for prevention and treatment of post-partum haemorrhageThe active ingredient in misoprostol tablets tends to degrade rapidly, making it technically demanding to produce a quality-assured product. Between 2011 and 2015, the Concept Foundation tested 215 samples of misoprostol acquired from licensed sellers in Argentina, Bangladesh, Egypt, Cambodia, Kenya, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, and Vietnam (figure 6\n).119 (55\u00b73%) of 215 products had a level of active ingredient within 90\u2013110% of specifications (between the horizontal lines in the figure), while 85 (39\u00b75%) had less than 90%. More products failed the longer they were stored. In 11 (5\u00b71%) products, more than 110% of stated content was found, perhaps to compensate in advance for degradation with time. Most importantly, 14 products (including 10 from a single manufacturer) contained neither misoprostol nor its principal degradation product. These were classified as falsified (diamond symbol in the figure); some were disguised as branded products and were therefore counterfeits as well.Most generic misoprostol products claim a shelf life of 2 years, while the innovator product has a shelf life of 3 years. Figure 6 clearly shows that after 1 year all 29 products packaged in plastic/aluminium blisters (red circles in figure 6) failed. Failure rates of full aluminium blisters (green circles in figure 6) were lower but still unacceptable (58/164, or 35\u00b74%). Aluminium blisters by themselves do not guarantee good quality, because the manufacturing environment also needs to be controlled.Despite the manufacturing challenges, quality-assured misoprostol products\u2014all packed in plastic/aluminium blisters (green square boxes in figure 6)\u2014can be manufactured. Only 1 (2\u00b70%) of 51 of the products approved by stringent regulatory authorities (SRAs), WHO prequalification, or the Global Fund Expert Review Panel (square boxes in figure 6) failed the test; this outcome is in contrast with non-SRA approved generic products (circles in figure 6). Regulatory oversight by an SRA is essential for this life-saving product.",

Using global expertise from both well resourced and resource-constrained countries, the WHO Expert Committee reports, as published in the WHO Technical Report Series, set general and product-specific quality, safety, and efficacy standards for all medicines, including vaccines, blood products, and biosimilars. The norms and standards developed by WHO are widely used as essential tools for standardising quality control of pharmaceuticals. They include the assignment of international non-proprietary (generic) names, WHO standards for Good Manufacturing Practices, WHO manufacturing guidelines for blood products, regulatory guidelines for the assessment of similar biotherapeutic products, and the International Pharmacopoeia.242 In recent years all major national or regional pharmacopoeias have worked towards convergence and harmonisation.243\n",

This information will also contribute to enhanced transparency.\nRegulatory committees with one or more patient representatives\nIn many countries the general public and patients are not involved in regulatory assessments and decisions, although civil society involvement supports adherence to human rights principles.\nInspections performed and inspection reports published\nEven when policies exist on paper, many countries struggle to enforce them with inspections. Many agencies therefore de facto do not control their markets or hold the various stakeholders (manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, and consumers such as hospitals and retail pharmacies) accountable. Inspections at points of sale can also be inconsistent, allowing unregistered and untraceable products through the supply chain and into the market. In several countries, including the USA, China, India, and Pakistan, some regulatory powers regarding the supply chain have been delegated to states or provinces, leading to discrepancies in enforcement and lack of central oversight (appendix 3.4). More data will promote accountability.\nNational manufacturers supported in achieving and maintaining good manufacturing practice (GMP)\nThe basic responsibility for quality and safety of a product lies with its manufacturer. Governments are only responsible to ensure that manufacturing standards exist and are enforced. Yet collaboration between NMRAs and manufacturers in promoting GMP presents an important opportunity. In 2012, a step-wise approach towards obtaining GMP was developed in Nigeria. Small incremental steps incentivised companies to aspire to the goal of manufacturing quality-assured medicines. In Ghana and Ethiopia, similar phase-in approaches towards full GMP compliance are in place. GMP qualification of a manufacturing facility unit can motivate working towards product-based WHO prequalification.\nRisk-based surveys and samples tested to monitor the quality of marketed products and analysis reports published per year\nWith the costs of new rapid quality assessment tools dropping, there is the potential to increase the number of quality assessment studies, facilitating more accurate determinations of the prevalence of substandard and falsified products and comparisons across settings. A particular need exists for studies on the quality of medicines for non-communicable diseases and biological products.\nQuality pharmacovigilance reports received and submitted to international databases\nThe number of reports from low-income and middle-income countries is still insufficient; tracking this information could motivate NMRAs to collaborate internationally. This might include spontaneous reporting and cohort event monitoring with national disease control programmes, especially for medicines for neglected tropical diseases after their release.\nRegulation of products for export\nMost countries, including high-income countries, have serious gaps in regulating the quality and safety of products for export.\nAbsence of legal obligation of patent linkage and extended data exclusivity\nSome bilateral or regional trade agreements have imposed patent linkage, and test data exclusivity norms that are not required under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Right Agreement (so-called TRIPS-plus requirements; see also section 5 and appendix 5.1).",

The implementation of e-CTD globally should be promoted to facilitate rapid exchanges of product assessments and site inspection reports among agencies. More intensive international collaboration and electronic exchange of information could simplify processes, prevent unnecessary duplication of effort in dossier assessments and site inspections, facilitate innovation, and shorten approval times.2WHO should evolve the WHO/UN Prequalification Programme to maintain a moving focus on new essential medicines. This evolution should move attention from mature products towards priority essential medicines that pose special challenges to regulators, such as human insulin and other biosimilars, and newly developed essential medicines. Its standards and public assessment reports should form the basis for regulatory convergence and mutual recognition, leading to rapid regulatory approval. A sustainable financial base must be created to maintain its full independence from donors and manufacturers.3Payers and procurement agencies must adopt good procurement practices that incorporate effective and transparent quality assurance. Quality assurance mechanisms must exist at all points in the supply chain. Appropriate quality assurance systems require investment. Sharing test results and findings of inspections can avoid duplication and increase efficiency.4Governments must redirect the activities of national regulatory agencies towards those that add value and reduce duplication of effort, and engage with a system for independent and public assessment of the performance of NMRAs. Activities aiming to address efficiency and effectiveness should cover all the basic components of a national medicines regulatory authority, with special focus on international harmonisation, prevention of duplicative efforts, maintenance of a single or central NMRA within a country, inspections and enforcement of regulations, assessments of new essential medicines for neglected diseases in their jurisdiction, regulation of medicine promotion, transparent reporting on the prevalence of substandard medicines in the market, pharmacovigilance, collaborating with domestic manufacturers in promoting GMP, and abstention from patent linkage and extended periods of data exclusivity.5Regulatory agencies must encourage the involvement of other stakeholders and the general public in promoting the quality and safety of essential medicines. This action can be achieved through, for example, the involvement of stakeholder representatives before regulatory decisions, the use of product quality verification testing at the point of sale, involving unique barcodes, portable low-cost quality-control equipment, or other technical devices linked via smartphones and the internet.6WHO and national governments must establish concrete targets and a public accountability mechanism for assessing the performance of national regulatory authorities. The goals should encompass all the basic components of a national regulatory authority, as listed in appendix 3.3, recommendations 4 and 5, and panel 12.\n",

In consulting the patient's medical record, the provider on duty sees that the patient was prescribed glibenclamide (5 mg daily) when he last came to the clinic, about 3 months ago. He has also been diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. Upon questioning, Jomkwan mentions that lately he has not been feeling well; he stated that he was somewhat shaky and his heart was pounding. He did not like that he was gaining more weight, despite skipping meals, and had decided to stop taking the glibenclamide since he had heard that it can make you gain weight. The doctor explains that diabetes medicines must be taken every day, and that it is important to have regular meals and physical activity. He adds a new antidiabetes medicine, sitagliptin, a medicine not included in the national insurance benefit package, to Jomkwan's regimen and instructs him to come back for a check-up in 3 months. When Jomkwan returns after 1 month, with worsening symptoms, he sees a different doctor, who tells him that according to standard treatment guidelines metformin, not sitagliptin and glibenclamide, should be used for his condition. She changes his prescription to metformin, and at his next check-up he reports feeling much better.",

            "text": "The second reason is that the problem of inappropriate use of medicines has had no clear owner. Medicines use is determined by the combined behaviours of many actors in local and national health systems (panel 13\n). The health, direct, and indirect economic costs of inappropriate use are often borne by individual patients and households paying out of pocket for medicines. Efforts to quantify the system-wide and individual health and economic consequences of inappropriate use are largely speculative. Reliable data on medicines expenditures and use by individual patients are scarce, and models linking clinician and patient behaviours with long-term health and financial outcomes are underdeveloped, especially in LMICs. The system-wide effects of inappropriate use on population health and economic development are therefore not widely recognised.Panel 13Appropriate use of medicines depends on behaviours of many stakeholders\n\u2022\nPatients must take the medicines that are clinically appropriate for their illnesses, in the right doses and dosage forms, at the right time, and for the recommended duration. Patients and their caregivers require: knowledge about symptoms and information to decide when and where to seek care; convenient access to quality medicines at affordable costs; and knowledge, motivation, and skills to use the recommended medicines as directed.\u2022\nPrescribers must prescribe clinically appropriate, cost-effective products. They require: diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making skills; up-to-date, evidence-based treatment guidelines that are consistent with medicines available and reimbursed in their systems; reliable, valid diagnostic tools in facilities; professionalism, training, time, and appropriate incentives to act in the interests of patients and caregivers.\u2022\nDispensers must provide high-quality products and sound advice at affordable prices. They require: knowledge to correctly order, purchase, store, and sell high-quality products from essential medicines and reimbursement lists that are consistent with up-to-date, evidence-based treatment guidelines; facilities, tools, processes to correctly order, purchase, receive, store, and sell needed, high-quality products; professionalism, training, time, and appropriate incentives to act in the interests of patients and customers.\u2022\nProfessional boards are responsible for setting standards for training and licensing care providers. They need: licensing and continuing education requirements that promote competent clinicians (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and others); regulatory oversight and power to enforce professional standards.\u2022\nConsumer organisations and pharmaceutical manufacturers provide information to health professionals, and in some settings directly to the public. They require: regulatory oversight to provide unbiased, evidence-based information.\u2022\nThe public sector and the private sector must meet demand for medicines with efficient supply systems. This requires: governance and management structures of public facilities, which must function accountably and efficiently to maximise the effective and efficient use of public resources; government standards and oversight of private sector providers from whom most medicines in low-income and middle-income countries are purchased.\u2022\nThird-party payers who are increasingly covering care costs in systems moving towards universal health coverage must make pharmaceutical coverage decisions and reimbursement arrangements with public and private sector providers that incentivise appropriate use of medicines. They require: financial resources, technical know-how, fair processes, and management tools to ensure that they pay for the right medicines at costs they can sustainably afford, considering population and individual patient needs and up-to-date clinical evidence; routinely collected information to monitor medicines use and spending; negotiating skills to engage in value-focused contracts with providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers.\u2022\nRegulators must guarantee that only safe, efficacious, high-quality products are available on the market, and should regulate promotional activities by industry. They require: capacity and resources to review and decide on licensing of originator, generic, and biosimilar products in a timely manner; capacity and resources to ensure licensed product quality; independence, transparency, and accountability of regulatory processes.\u2022\nManufacturers and importers must produce and sell quality medicines that are needed, working with public procurement systems, wholesalers and distributors to establish efficient supply chains. They need: regulatory oversight, technology, and incentives to ensure manufacture, import, and distribution of needed quality products.\u2022\nManufacturer associations establish and monitor industry codes of conduct. Effective regulatory environments within which high standard codes of conduct are enforced.\u2022\nScientists in universities and companies must invent new molecules and formulations that meet population needs. They require: society, industry, and philanthropy funding and incentives to conduct needed research and development.\n",

Coordinated and sustained attention to priority medicine use problems is also undermined by a range of factors: the almost singular focus on the part of many international donors, non-governmental organisations, and development agencies on access to medicines for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; fragmented and frequently competing priorities across stakeholders; and operating environments with weak legal and regulatory structures, lack of awareness of the problem, or inadequate political will to tackle it.",

Although data remain poor, promotion appears to be growing in middle-income countries because of growing markets, increasing numbers of local manufacturers, more direct-to-consumer advertising, lack of local codes of marketing practice, weaker regulation, and less-developed consumer movements when compared with high-income countries.Most new pharmaceutical promotions are subtle\u2014they might not even be immediately recognisable as product advertisement. Some instances have received considerable attention, such as direct payments to medical practitioners in China.298 Globally, the problem is increasingly hard to control as companies transition to digital methods, including the use of social media (panel 16\n). The number and severity of breaches of national legislation and industry codes are not related to the size of the company.82\nPanel 16Digital promotion of medicine goes beyond web sitesCompanies increasingly use a wide range of digital marketing approaches, such as online events, emailed product updates, and webinars. Health-care professionals use websites to read medical news, connect with peers, and obtain continuing education credits\u2014these often incorporate advertisements, sponsored discussion forums, and marketing games. For example, Sermo's Alzheimer's Challenge invited site users to earn cash by answering questions about clinical trial data for a branded product.299\nCompanies also target consumers through apps, search engine optimisation, and social media campaigns. In 2015, an Instagram posting featuring Kim Kardashian promoted a morning sickness medicine to her 42 million social media followers (appendix 4.3). The US Food and Drug Administration ordered the manufacturer to remove the posting on the grounds that it was \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d.300 By the time the decision was reached the post had received nearly half a million likes and 11 000 comments.An extensive literature review301 by WHO and HAI found that promotion strongly influences prescribing, and that prescribers underestimate the influence of company funding, educational events, and research. Effective interventions to counter this effect were: government regulation, training of students, media exposure of abusive promotion, and free provision of non-commercial therapeutic information to professionals and the public.Yet most regulatory authorities struggle to control promotion. Many governments do not consider it a priority, and enforcement is often poor. Preapproval of advertisements is scarce, so breaches are identified after exposure and weak penalties are not a deterrent. Some governments rely on industry self-regulation,302 but this strategy is often insufficiently effective, as voluntary codes are created and monitored by the companies themselves and are not necessarily legally enforceable.The WHO Ethical Criteria for Medicinal Drug Promotion46 remain the gold standard for controlling promotion. They advise, among other strategies, against direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines to the public. So, while they did not explicitly anticipate internet advertising or social media, a ban on direct-to-consumer advertising is enough to set the baselines for the regulation of both methods. Regulators can then adapt the criteria to the contemporary context. The US Sunshine Act,303 France's Loi Bertrand,304 and the Dutch Transparency Register, which mandate disclosure of financial links between pharmaceutical companies and health-care professionals, also reflect the ethical criteria. This transparency now needs to be followed by an independent review and, when necessary, corrective action.Stricter regulation of pharmaceutical promotion is one of the core functions of national regulatory authorities. Lack of funding for adequate monitoring and enforcement remains a key barrier that needs to be removed.305 Governments should also ensure access to unbiased and free information on medicines, which should be treated as a public good.Panel 17Examples of system factors contributing to various forms of inappropriate use of medicines\nOveruse\n\n\u2022Availability of products that lack efficacy, safety, or comparative effectiveness\u2022Business models incentivising aggressive marketing of products\u2022Lack of effective regulation to limit licensing of ineffective products, aggressive marketing\u2022Payment models incentivising high-volume prescribing, dispensing, and use\u2022Lack of qualified prescribers, dispensers, or other care givers\u2022Patient or public expectations, perceptions, and preferences\n\nUnderuse\n\n\u2022Lack of practical, affordable, reliable, and valid diagnostic tools\u2022Lack of effective treatments in needed forms for certain conditions\u2022Supply chain problems leading to stock outs of tests and medicines\u2022Lack of qualified diagnosticians, prescribers, dispensers, and other care givers\u2022Lack of patient knowledge and resources to seek care, purchase, and take medicines\u2022Payment models incentivising low-volume prescribing, dispensing\u2022Out-of-pocket payment resulting in underuse\u2022Patient or public expectations, perceptions, and preferences\n\nMisuse\n\n\u2022Lack of needed dosage forms and strengths\u2022Lack of practical, affordable, reliable, valid diagnostic tools, and therapeutic monitoring tests\u2022Supply chain problems leading to stock-outs of medicines and test materials\u2022Payment models do not incentivise use for therapeutic drug monitoring\u2022Lack of qualified prescribers, dispensers, and other care givers\u2022Lack of resources for therapeutic drug monitoring\u2022Limited time and knowledge of prescribers and dispensers\u2022Patient or public expectations, perceptions, and preferences\n\nUnnecessary use of highly priced medicines\n\n\u2022Ineffective regulation to guarantee low-cost, quality-assured generic products on markets\u2022Ineffective policy processes to encourage price and quality competition for generic products\u2022Ineffective policy and negotiation processes to lower prices of medicines\u2022Payment models incentivising use of high-cost products\u2022Payment models do not incentivise use of low-cost, quality-assured generic products\u2022Lack of effective communication on quality and value of lower cost, high-quality generic products\u2022Lack of communication on evidence or guideline-based care algorithms\u2022Provider, patient, public expectations, perceptions, and preferences\n",

Two systematic reviews311, 312 of evidence on interventions to improve health-worker behaviour have used the Effective Practice and Organization of Care criteria313 for study quality and restricted their analyses to studies from LMICs only. In the first, Holloway and colleagues311 summarised the studies on the effects of well designed interventions to improve treatment of paediatric infections (n=44) and general outpatient prescribing (n=110). The median improvement in practice across all types of interventions in LMIC settings was modest (about 16% for the treatment of paediatric infections and 7% for general outpatient prescribing).14, 311 Larger median effects tended to occur when multifaceted strategies combined several components (for example, education directed at both providers and consumers about the same medicine use issue), as compared with single strategies. Community case management programmes (in which community members are trained to recognise and treat common illnesses such as respiratory infections and diarrhoea, provided with medicines, and supervised in care delivery) had consistently positive effects that were notably higher than those of other strategies.",

IMCI is the type of multi-component intervention that literature reviews suggest should be effective. However, national evaluation results were sobering.315 Most countries found it challenging to scale up the strategy while maintaining fidelity to the approach. Community engagement was generally weak, and essential programme messages were not effectively communicated. Furthermore, programme reach suffered because implementation exclusively relied on public sector delivery systems and failed to involve other sources of care. The assessments suggested that successful implementation of large national programmes to improve use of medicines requires more than specific technical design elements. Political commitment, dedicated human and financial resources, coordinated policies and programmes, and meaningful engagement of various stakeholders are equally important.315\n\u2022The tuberculosis Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) programme is one of the core elements at the heart of WHO's Stop TB Strategy.316 Daily supervision of therapy, often in specialised tuberculosis treatment centres, is burdensome; nevertheless, the importance of DOT has frequently been defended as essential to programme success.317 However, a systematic review318 concluded that DOT did not provide a solution to low levels of adherence. Given that substantial resources are required to implement DOT, the review concludes that tailoring treatment models to local circumstances might better address financial and logistical barriers to care, as well as patient and staff motivation and other issues.\n",

NPS MedicineWise also provides professional development activities, including online learning, online case studies, clinical e-audits, and educational visiting. Its in-depth assessment strategy incorporates strong qualitative elements, such as regular stakeholder surveys, as well as time-series analyses of routine prescribing data, to document changes stimulated by its programmes (panel 18\n, table 6\n). Funded by the Australian Government, NPS MedicineWise reports annually on its achievements in quality gains and cost savings. In 2013\u201314, in addition to savings in other areas, NPS MedicineWise programmes across seven therapeutic areas resulted in savings of AU$ 69\u00b72 million for the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme.321 Its revenue reported in 2014\u201315 was about $45 million,320 compared with total spending of just over $9 billion in 2013\u201314.322\nPanel 18Improving quality use of medicines by Australian providers and consumersNPS MedicineWise is an independent, not-for-profit, evidence-based organisation that works across the Australian health sector and broader community to deliver improved medicines use, better health outcomes, and more efficient health care.NPS MedicineWise involves stakeholders, develops key messages, and produces a mix of publications, products, and interventions designed to achieve these specific outcomes.An in-house evaluation team assesses NPS MedicineWise and its activities.

The country context will influence both the appropriate structure and resource base to support an independent medicines-focused analytics unit.2Pharmaceutical analytics units must collaborate with multiple stakeholders in all relevant systems to increase their engagement in and accountability for quality use of medicines, and to intervene jointly on use of medicines problems. An analytics unit independent from public and private sector stakeholders is positioned to interact with multiple stakeholders, whose diverging objectives and behaviours might contribute to appropriate and inappropriate use of medicines, engaging them in information generation and analysis, intervention design, implementation, and monitoring and assessment.3Engaged stakeholder groups, led by data produced by the pharmaceutical analytics unit, should identify and prioritise local medicines use problems, identify contributing factors across the system, and develop and implement sustainable, long-term, multifaceted interventions. The process of multi-stakeholder engagement in a priority setting for national activities to promote quality use of medicines can result in better understanding of each stakeholder's underlying assumptions, motivations, and objectives. To succeed, there must be tangible benefits of such constructive engagement for all stakeholders.\n",

DNDi is expanding its scope from neglected diseases to HIV, hepatitis C, and antimicrobial resistance.379 These initiatives have also provided important insights into the true cost of R&D (panel 19\n). Yet the research agenda of these initiatives largely follows the priorities of donor governments and foundations. A transparent priority-setting process is missing. As a result, some important therapeutic areas are hardly covered, such as diabetes, cancers and other NCDs, and mental disorders.Panel 19Developing a new medicine: how much does it cost?The real costs of pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) are often kept as trade secrets. In 2016, industry-supported estimates set the average cost for medicines developed between 1995 and 2007 at US$2\u00b75 billion per new product. In 2012, an industry-funded study by the Office of Health Economics came to an estimate of $1\u00b7506 billion for development cost per new product. These figures are used by the pharmaceutical industry to justify high medicine prices, but have been challenged by others.380, 381 Even some in the industry have expressed scepticism. GlaxoSmithKline's chief executive officer, Sir Andrew Witty, called the $1 billion figure \u201cone of the great myths of the industry.\u201d382 Light and Warburton380 estimated that the net investment by the industry to discover important new medicines amounts to 1\u00b72% of sales. Table 9 summarises the R&D cost estimates published since 1991.In 2001, the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development estimated the costs of successfully developing a new chemical entity to treat tuberculosis to be approximately $37\u201340 million (excluding the costs of failure). This cost covers preclinical development ($4\u00b79\u20135\u00b73 million), pharmaceutical development (>$5\u00b73 million), and phases 1 to 3 of clinical development ($26\u00b76 million). Including the costs of unsuccessful projects would increase the total costs to $76\u2013115 million.388\nThe Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative estimated that R&D expenditure for an improved treatment (ie, a combination product using existing molecules) would be between $10 and $40 million. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative's cost for the development of a new chemical entity is estimated at \u20ac100\u2013150 million, on the basis of the real cost for products developed by the Product Development Partnership and including cost of failures.389 These estimates do not include in-kind contributions by the industry.",

This should include developing a list of missing essential medicines, within the context of the WHO Global Health R&D observatory and in close connection with the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. The WHO mechanism to identify missing essential medicines should be further developed, with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.2Governments must lead the process towards a global R&D policy framework and agreements, which include new financing mechanisms to ensure that missing essential medicines are developed and made affordable. Such mechanisms should be based on transparent estimates of the real cost of R&D; they might include a pooled fund for global health R&D, prize funds, targeted research partnerships and advance market agreements, and licensing of related patents, leading to an increasing number of new priority products with an affordable price which is delinked from R&D costs (known as progressive delinking).3The international community must create a general EMPP. Such a pool could be hosted and managed by the current MPP. Companies should license their patents related to essential medicines to the EMPP under a set of conditions. Patents of medicines developed under the new research agreement or any other new financing mechanism could also be licensed through the EMPP. The EMPP should use a tiered royalty system to remunerate the patent holder and to contribute to R&D expenditure.4Governments and national stakeholders must develop and implement comprehensive national action plans to guarantee equitable access to new essential medicines, including open knowledge innovation, fair licensing practices, support for a patent pool for essential medicines, full use of TRIPS flexibilities when needed, and rejecting TRIPS-plus provisions.5The pharmaceutical industry must better align its R&D priority setting with global health needs, and develop access strategies to make medically important innovations available to all in need. To this end the industry could determine a certain percentage of its profits to reinvest in R&D for medicines that are not commercially attractive, but are deemed essential from a public health perspective. Equitable access strategies should include broad licensing of patents and technology transfer to enable generic medicines production; and equitable pricing mechanisms. The policies and practices of pharmaceutical companies should be independently assessed by international mechanisms, such as the ATM Index.\n",

Promoting equity in access to essential medicines must be a key priority. Throughout the report, the Commission noted the special importance of essential medicines policies that contribute to achieving equity. Disaggregating data ensures that different strata of society are well represented and can be compared when measuring the effect of such policies.2Strengthening institutions: throughout the report, the Commission identified a range of specialised knowledge and skills required to implement essential medicines policies, as well as to collect and analyse data for decision making and accountability. These capacities cannot rest solely with a single person in a country. For sustainability and accountability, institutional structures and processes must be created and supported to develop, administer, implement, and assess policies. One key structure and process is an independent review mechanism that can identify when corrective action is necessary. The capacities of various institutions to carry out these tasks must be strengthened through the establishment of explicit mandates, the assurance of independence, and the provision of dedicated funding.3Promoting accountability: accountability refers to a responsibility to meet specific obligations, and for actors to answer to one another in a public and transparent process.462 The ultimate aims of UHC\u2014improving health status, protecting against financial catastrophe due to illness, and achieving patient satisfaction\u2014require commitment and concerted action by governments and other partners. Governments must demonstrate to citizens that their policies, and the institutions and administrative mechanisms that implement policies, are accomplishing these goals. Increasingly, governments are also agreeing to demonstrate progress to the international community, as with the SDGs. To track change, data must be collected, analysed, and shared with stakeholders. Accountability requires transparency in decision making and about the results of independent assessments of interventions.463 Stakeholder participation in the processes of decision making also promotes accountability; beneficiaries must be represented whenever decisions are made on their behalf. Civil society participation is key to representing the public at large, as well as to protecting particular subgroups.464\n\n",

One of the indicators included in this set\u2014household expenditure on pharmaceuticals as a percentage of total household expenditure\u2014is a measure of financial protection. To measure progress on reducing disparities related to financing essential medicines, household expenditure on pharmaceuticals as a percentage of total household expenditure should be disaggregated by income, ethnicity, education, geography, and other relevant characteristics (such as households with a member living with NCDs). Since household data on expenditure is often separate from data on the health status of household members, it can be difficult to meaningfully measure equity with existing datasets.15 Indicators for financing depend on household surveys to obtain data on household expenditures on pharmaceuticals, including out-of-pocket expenditure. Yet many countries still lack routinely collected and nationally representative household data.15 Measuring progress towards UHC provide an opportunity to integrate the indicators into a wider SDG-monitoring framework.",
