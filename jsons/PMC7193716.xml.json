During an EIT examination, a series of EIT scans is acquired showing the instantaneous distribution of electrical impedance changes in the chest cross-section relative to a reference state (top left). In this example, the reference impedance distribution corresponded to the average impedance distribution during a 20-s long phase of mechanical ventilation. Thus, the EIT scans show higher regional impedance values at higher regional lung volumes (light tones), lower values at lower volumes (dark tones) or minimum changes when the regional lung volumes were close to the reference volumes. The tracing of global EIT data (bottom left) was generated by summing up all 912 image pixel values of relative impedance change (rel.\u0394Z) in each scan of the acquired series and plotting them as a function of time. An increase in impedance values occurs during inspiration, a fall in impedance is observed during expiration. The light grey circles and the dotted arrows indicate at which moment of the respiratory cycle; the four EIT scans were obtained. The tracings of regional EIT data (right) originate from three image pixels shown as small squares in the EIT scans. The top tracing is a plot of a time series of local relative impedance change obtained in pixel 1 which was located in an anterior region of the chest. Thus, the signal contains impedance changes related to ventilation superimposed on which are the more frequent changes synchronous with the heart rate. The middle tracing originates from the pixel 2 located at the edge of the left lung region showing predominantly the ventilation-related impedance changes. The bottom tracing was obtained in the pixel 3 in the right lung region and shows the highest ventilation-related changes in impedance with time. (The EIT data presented in this figure originate from an EIT examination of an 8-week-old infant with a body weight of 4,585 g and a length of 56 cm. The infant suffered from posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus and was studied in the operating room prior to surgery during continuous positive pressure ventilation with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg body weight and positive end-expiratory pressure of 4 cm H2O. The respiratory rate was 26 breaths/min, the inspiration/expiration ratio was 1/1 and the fraction of inspired O2 23 %)",

A 30-s tracing of global EIT data is shown, generated by summing up all 912 EIT image pixel values of relative impedance change (rel.\u0394Z) from a series of 750 EIT scans. The examination was performed in a 10-week-old preterm infant with a body weight of 2,500 g and a length of 44 cm. The data was acquired in a neonatal intensive care unit during postoperative weaning from mechanical ventilation after orchiopexy. The infant was ventilated in an assisted mode with synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV). The respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, the inspiration/expiration ratio was 1/5.2, positive end-expiratory pressure 3 cm H2O, peak inspiratory pressure 24 cm H2O and the fraction of inspired O2 21 %. During the initial phase of the examination, highlighted by the first light grey area, the EIT signal reflects the typical lung volume changes occurring in the lungs during SIMV: the four large deflections represent the larger ventilator-induced breaths, the smaller deflections in between originate from the smaller spontaneous tidal breaths. During the subsequent short apnoea, the impedance values fall to a new end-expiratory level due to loss in lung volume, followed by three-controlled ventilator-induced breaths during continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPPV), highlighted by the second light grey area. The small and rapid impedance signal fluctuations, discernible especially during the apnoeic and CPPV phases, are synchronous with the heart rate of 152 beats/min. The three images at the top of the figure are functional EIT scans showing the distribution of tidal volumes: the left two of these scans were generated from the SIMV phase and provide the distribution of both ventilator-induced and spontaneous breaths, and the right image shows the tidal volume distribution during CPPV. Of note is the more pronounced ventilation of anterior lung regions during fully controlled ventilation without spontaneous breathing activity. The five functional scans on the right show the changes in regional lung volume at different phases of the EIT examination compared with the lowest volume at end-expiration during CPPV",
