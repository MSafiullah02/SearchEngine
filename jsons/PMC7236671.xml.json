There are multiple possible reasons for discordant results. This includes RNA degradation (for example, during transport or storage between the two assays being performed), differences in genetic targets, primer sequences, reagents, or amplification conditions. The two assays target different SARS-CoV-2-specific genes, which could lead to false negative results if a mutation prevents primer binding. Natural variability at the limit of detection of PCR assays may also be explained by sampling differences. Several of the samples in our study were from patients having clearance swabs collected at least a week after symptom onset, thus the viral load would be expected to be at or near the limit of detection for many of these samples.",
