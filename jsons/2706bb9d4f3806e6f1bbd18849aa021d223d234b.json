Such microarray technology represents a union between molecular genetics and classical cytogenetics. Two types of microarray technology are used clinically: comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. CGH directly measures copy number differences between a patient's DNA and a normal reference DNA spanning known genes, chromosomal regions, or across the entire genome. SNP analysis, on the other hand, provides identification of a single point mutation via sequencing the gene in areas of suspected abnormality, previously identified via CGH or FISH. Another offshoot of microarray technology is submicroscopic chromosome copy number variation (CNV) analysis, in which deletions or duplications involving > 1-kb DNA have been detected in patients with mental retardation, autism, and multiple congenital anomalies.",

            "text": "There are several recent, detailed reviews of the genetics of autism (Abrahams & Geschwind, 2008; Li & Andersson, 2009; Losh et al., 2008; O'Roak & State, 2008) and this chapter summarizes those reviews. The reader is encouraged to first review the overview of gene expression (Box 6.1) and essential nomenclature used in genetics (Box 6.2). In addition, one must understand basic concepts pertinent to brain development (Box 6.3) and to the neurobiology of autism (Box 6.4) in order to understand its genetics. For example, there is a compelling rationale that genetically directed mechanisms that regulate the assembly of the brain during embryogenesis, when gone awry, may cause autism (Costa e Silva, 2008). Box 6.1 Overview of DNA Replication and Gene Expression * Genes. A gene is a unit of hereditary material located in a specific place (locus) on a chromosome. Most genes carry the instructions for producing a specific protein. A protein-coding human gene will have a coding sequence, which contains the information for protein production. The coding sequence may be broken up into several sub-sequences, or exons, which are separated by noncoding DNA sequences, or introns. The coding sequence is flanked by a promoter and (usually) a 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR) that occur immediately before the coding sequence and by a 3 -UTR and a terminator that occur immediately after the coding sequence. Promoters, terminators, UTRs, and introns can regulate the activity of a given gene. At a molecular level, chromosomes are composed of long chains of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) upon which genes are linearly arranged. The DNA exists in a double helix and the helical strands are usually wrapped around histone proteins. In addition to DNA and histones, chromosomes contain scaffolding proteins that provide structural support and may also participate in gene regulation. DNA is a molecule composed of a chain of four different types of nucleotides. It is the sequence of these nucleotides that is the genetic information that organisms inherit. DNA is double stranded with nucleotides on each strand complementary to each other. Each strand acts as a template for creating a new partner strand. This is the physical method for making copies of genes that are inherited. Both individual DNA nucleotides and DNAassociated proteins can be chemically modified to produce epigenetic variation that may be in response to environmental conditions and might or might not be inherited in any individual case. Epigenetic variation can significantly alter the expression level of a gene without changing its basic genetic code. DNA replication. During DNA replication, a DNA strand is produced from component nucleotides using its partner strand as a template. This is done by DNA polymerases that \"proofread\" to ensure accuracy and repair when necessary. Despite these safeguards, errors called mutations can occur during the polymerization of this second strand. A mutation is any nucleotide sequence in a DNA molecule that does not match its original DNA molecule from which it is copied. Radiation, such as ultraviolet rays and X-rays, viruses, and errors that occur during meiosis or during DNA replication can cause errors in DNA molecules. These mutations can have an impact on the phenotype of an organism, especially when they occur within the protein-coding sequence of the gene. Kinds of mutations include the following: Frameshift Mutation: One or more bases are inserted or deleted. This can alter the entire amino acid sequence of a protein or introduce aberrant RNA splicing.",

Gene regulation is controlled by noncoding DNA sequences, such as the promoter, terminator, or introns, and by epigenetic variation, such as differences in DNA methylation and histone acetylation. This entire process takes place within the cell in the vicinity of the nucleus, where DNA is housed and hnRNA is spliced, and in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are located along the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Some proteins are further processed in the Golgi apparatus if they are to be exported from the cell. The correspondence between nucleotide and amino acid sequence is known as the genetic code. RNA transcription. In transcription, DNA is used as a blueprint for the production of RNA. Transcription is performed by RNA polymerase which adds one ribonucleotide to a growing RNA strand, complimentary to the DNA nucleotide being transcribed. This product is heterologous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). RNA splicing. In splicing, hnRNA is processed within the nucleus to remove introns which may function to partially regulate transcription and join exons, which code for the actual protein product. The product of slicing is mRNA. Translation. Translation is the production of proteins by decoding the mRNA that was produced by transcription and splicing. The mRNA sequence is the template that guides the production of a chain of amino acids that form a protein. decade, this technique enables examination of the whole human genome on a single chip with a resolution as high as a few hundred base pairs.

The anterior neural tube expands rapidly due to cell proliferation and eventually gives rise to the brain. Cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, the main cellular components of the brain. The neurons must migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures. The neurons grow connections (axons and dendrites) which often must span long distances to reach their target cells. Growth cones are the highly motile filamentous connections that eventually form more stable synapses between neurons. Neurons communicate with other neurons via these synapses.

Localized vesicles are at the active sites and clustered receptors are at the postsynaptic membrane with glial cells that encapsulate the entire synaptic cleft. There is differentiation of the pre-and postsynaptic membrane following initial contact between two cells.

Therefore, the number of neurons in the young cortex is a function of the number of proliferative cells present at the onset of neurogenesis. Tumor suppressor genes which control brain growth and migration, when defective, could contribute to macrocephaly of failure in synaptic pruning. This explains the great interest in tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN as candidate genes for autism.",

Cell adhesion suppresses brain growth, while abnormalities in adhesion promote growth or contribute to aberrant growth. It is believed that heterogeneous causes of autism may be associated with alterations in adhesion molecules of the synapse or cytoplasmic molecules associated with synaptic receptors. Indeed, recent genetic evidence has found associations between autism susceptibility and other neuronal cell adhesion molecules, such as NLGN1 and ASTN2 and specific cadherins.",

If the phenotype was expanded to include a cognitive or a language disorder, the concordance rates were 82 and 10%, respectively. Two subsequent studies found an MZ/DZ concordance rate of 91-0% (Steffenburg et al., 1989) or 60-5% utilizing the specific phenotype, and 90% vs. 10% using the broader phenotype which included social or cognitive deficits . Across twin studies of autism, the difference between MZ and DZ concordance rates is sizable, averaging roughly 10:1 (Pennington, 2009 ). This rate is greater than that for other psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (between 2:1 and 4:1), indicating a high heritability for autism (Pennington, 2009 ). On the other hand, there was great variability in IQ and clinical behaviors in the 16 MZ pairs concordant for autism in the study. In other words, there was no more similarity for these traits within MZ pairs than that between individuals picked at random from different MZ pairs who also had autism. As interpreted by Pennington (2009) , this finding suggests that although autism is heritable, the genes may not dictate the exact phenotype. Nonadditive interaction among genes (epistasis) and nonshared environmental influences likely contribute to these differences in phenotypes. Further, the large disparity between the MZ and the DZ concordance rates has been attributed to epistasis (Pennington, 2009 ). Alternatively, rare gene variants causing a common disorder (autism), as described below, could contribute to this large MZ/DZ discordance.",

Family studies (cited in Geschwind & Konopka, 2009; Pennington, 2009) suggest that the risk of autism is 20-60% higher in siblings compared to the incidence of autism in the general population, and to that of other psychiatric disorders. Several studies have shown that a broad autism phenotype is transmitted in families of individuals with autism (Piven, 1999; Rutter, 2000) . For example, first-degree relatives of individuals with autism were shown to be shy, aloof, and have problematic pragmatic language (Rutter, 2000) .

Sex linkage involves a gene on the X chromosome transmitted from the mother to the son. As the son has only one X chromosome, this gene would be expressed. Since the mother's daughter has two copies of the X chromosome -one from her father and one from her mother -the daughter likely would not express the abnormal phenotype. The most well-known example of a sex-linked disorder is hemophilia, which is on the X chromosome. Genomic imprinting, on the other hand, is an epigenetic phenomenon wherein chemical modification of DNA that does not alter the basic DNA sequence or modification of the DNA-associated histone proteins determines whether the maternal or the paternal copy of a specific gene is expressed. Genomic imprinting has been determined for Prader Willi and Angelman's syndrome.",

Further, Abraham and Geschwind (2008) state that no single genetic cause accounts for more than 1-2% of cases -similar to what is seen in mental retardation, another condition without a single genetic cause. While numerous studies identifying candidate genes or makers have been reported, very few studies have been replicated (Losh et al., 2008) . Reasons to explain why candidates have not been agreed upon include the initial lack of uniform diagnostic criteria (strict vs. broad definition), limited power, varying methodology (Losh et al., 2008) , and neglect of epigenetic factors modeling the disorder (Lahiri, Maloney, & Zawia, 2009) . Further, as with other conditions with a strong heritable component, it appears that different genes may contribute to distinct components of the condition which gives rise to the full disorder through concerted actions (Losh et al., 2008; Pickles et al., 1995) . Consequently, it has been said that linkage technology has not \"found the autism gene,\" but rather it demonstrated that more powerful technology is necessary to explain the multiple genes associated with autism (Abrahams & Geschwind, 2008) . No one knows just how heterogeneous the syndrome is likely to be, that is, how many genes or regions of DNA (loci) may contribute either within a single individual or among the entire group of affected individuals.

            "text": "Recently, a rare-variant common disease model has been introduced (O' Roak & State, 2008) . In this model, rare genes explain the common disease of autism. This makes sense in the Darwinian tradition that a deleterious change in the human genome leads to reduced fitness and that this would not be likely to propagate within a population. Autism fits the rare gene-common disease model as it begins early in life, impairs social interactions, and is associated with mental retardation which impacts reproductive fitness (O'Roak & State, 2008) . The large difference seen between monozygotic and dizygotic concordance rates is consistent with de novo (rare gene) mutation. It appears that simplex families demonstrate de novo mutations more frequentlywith one family member with autism (Sebat et al., 2007) whereas multiplex families demonstrate transmitted variants (Bakkaloglu et al., 2008) . The search for rare variants has led to the study of families that are genetically isolated, with shared ancestry and prone to consanguinity (Morrow et al., 2008; Strauss et al., 2006) to locate recessive alleles. Finally, rare sequence variations have been detected, thanks to improved technology such as CNV analysis. Indeed within the last 5-10 years, 20 bona fide risk genes have been identified due to the improved technology developed after the linkage method (Abrahams & Geschwind, 2008) . Several of these risk genes will be discussed in the following sections. Abrahams and Geschwind (2008) write that two views underlie genetic autism research. The first is that rare variants involve an abnormality in a single molecule causing the clinical pathology in autism. Mendelian inheritance (autosomal dominant vs. recessive) takes this form. Technology compatible with this approach includes cytogenetics (including karyotyping and FISH), gene association studies (analysis of genes and protein system from less complex genetic syndromes similar to autism such as Rett and fragile X syndromes), linkage studies (including genome screens in affected sibling pairs), microarray technology, and CNV analysis. The second view involves the study of independent hereditary endophenotypes representing the core features of autism. An endophenotype is an operationally defined behavioral feature such as age of first spoken word. Although there is a general consensus regarding endophenotypes commonly seen in autism, the behaviors may not be specific to autism, as delay in language acquisition accompanies many developmental disorders. Ideally, endophenotypes represent discreet behaviors which do not overlap with other behaviors from the autism core domains (i.e., language, socialization, and rigid behavior). For example, poor eye contact, representing a deficit with socialization, is construed as being independent of repetitive behaviors, thought to represent the rigid behavior domain. Genetic study of these discreet endophenotypes, largely undertaken via linkage studies, narrows the scope of analysis (Losh et al., 2008; O'Roak & State, 2008) .",

The discovery of fragile X ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) provides a precedent to study the relationship of developmental conditions across the life span within and between families. FXTAS is an adult-onset ataxia/dementia syndrome found in older family members of individuals with FXS (Hagerman, 2002; Hagerman et al., 2001) . In contrast to what is found in FXS, FXTAS occurs with a rise in FMR1 mRNA level (Hagerman, 2006) , fewer than 200 repeats (Basehore & Friez, 2009) , and hypomethylation (Berry-Kravis, Potanas, Weinberg, Zhou, & Goetz, 2005) in the FMR1 CGG section on the X chromosome. This association of two clinically divergent disorders, regulated by the same gene produced in different doses, sets the stage for the investigation of the shared biology between autism, FXS, and other genes related to Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid precursor protein (APP).",

            "text": "APP, which is encoded by a gene on chromosome 21, is a large (695-770 amino acid) glycoprotein produced in several central nervous system (CNS) cell types including microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. After protein processing, mature APP is axonally transported and can be released from axon terminals in response to electrical activity. APP is believed to play an important role in neuronal maturation and in synaptogenesis as reviewed by Lahiri, Farlow, Greig, Giacobini, and Schneider (2003) . APP is of great interest because processing products of APP can include the insoluble 40-42-amino acid amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2-40 and A\u03b2-42, respectively), the principal component of the cerebral plaques associated with memory and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (Alley et al., 2010) . Recent research linking APP to autism illustrates how association studies enable the generation of new hypotheses about the biology of autism and ultimately advance our understanding of this disorder. Recently, we found evidence to support an association between autism and one of the APP pathways established for Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to the upregulation of the amyloidogenic pathway as seen in Alzheimer's disease, we found evidence that there may be an upregulation of the nonamyloidogenic (\u03b1-secretase amyloid precursor protein, sAPP\u03b1) pathway in a small sample of children with severe autism associated with self-injurious and aggressive behavior. That is, children with severe autism expressed total sAPP (representing the combined amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathways) at two or more times the levels of children without autism and up to four times the levels of children with mild autism (Sokol et al., 2006) . Overall, there was a trend toward higher sAPP\u03b1 within the children with autism. One of the severely autistic children in this study had FXS. High levels of sAPP\u03b1 have also been found in a sample of children with autism from an independent laboratory (Bailey et al., 2008) . High levels of sAPP\u03b1 imply an increased \u03b1-secretase pathway in autism (anabolic), opposite to what is seen in Alzheimer's disease. This would be consistent with the brain overgrowth hypothesis attributed to autism, in contrast to the brain atrophy seen with the deposition of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease. Coincidentally, via animal studies, Westmark and Malter (2007) concluded that FMRP binds to and regulates translation of APP mRNA through mGLuR 5 , providing a potential link between neuronal proteins associated with AD and FXS. By way of mGluR 5 , FMRP provides the \"brake,\" which if unchecked in conditions such as FXS would favor high levels of APP. Further, high levels of APP have been found in another study of FMR1 knockout mice (D'Agata et al., 2002) . These findings have led to enticing speculation that the APP gene may influence several neurodevelopmental disorders across the life span.",

Mutations leading to amino acid changes have been found on the WNT2 gene on 7q31 in two families with autism, and one affected parent transmitting the mutation to two affected children (Li et al., 2004; Wassink, Brzustowicz, Bartlett, & Szatmari, 2004) . The FOXP2 gene on 7q31 was found to be disrupted in one family with an autosomal dominant form of specific language impairment (SLI) (Lai, Fisher, Hurst, Vargha-Khadem, & Monaco, 2001) , and this was replicated in a larger study of SLI (O'Brien, Zhang, Nishimura, Tomblin, & Murray, 2003) , although initial studies failed to associate this with autism (Newbury et al., 2002; Wassink et al., 2001) . Recently, FOXP2 differences in gene expression were found between chimp and human cell cultures . Compared to chimps, in human culture, the FOXP2 gene affected transcription upregulation in 61 genes and downregulation in 55 genes. Further, the FOXP2 gene was shown to regulate downstream effects involving cerebellar motor function, craniofacial formation, and cartilage and connective tissue formation required for expressive language.

Neuroligins are cell-adhesion molecules localized postsynaptically at both glutamatergic (NLGN1, NLGN3, NLGN4, NLGN4Y) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acidergic (NLGN2) synapses (Lintas & Persico, 2009) . Neuroligins trigger the formation of functional presynaptic structures in contacting axons. As mentioned above, they interact with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins such as SHANK3 (see below). The NLGN3 and NLGN4 genes are located at chromosomes Xq13 and Xq22, 33, respectively, and mutations here have been associated with autism Jamain et al. (2003) . Extensive genetic screens conducted by several research groups have confirmed the low frequency of neuroligin mutations among individuals with autism (Lintas & Persico, 2009) . For example, Jamain et al. (2003) found a frameshift mutation in NLGN4 and a missense mutation in NLGN3 in two unrelated Swedish families, inherited from unaffected mothers. Laumonnier et al. (2004) reported a frameshift mutation in NLGN4 in 13 affected male members of a single pedigree. Lawson-Yuen, Saldivar, Sommer, and Picker (2008) found a deletion of exons 4-6 of NLGN4 in a boy with autism and in his brother with Tourette syndrome whose mother showed psychiatric problems and also carried the mutation. Neuroligin mutation carriers, however, display a variety of syndromes, such as X-linked mental retardation without autism (Laumonnier et al., 2004) , Asperger's syndrome, autistic disorder of variable severity, and PDD-NOS (Yan et al., 2005) . The symptoms may be slow, or abrupt and associated with regression. Despite intensive investigation, the low frequency of neuroligin mutations and the lack of similar phenotypes have led to the recommendation that neuroligins should not be included in widespread screens for individuals with nonsyndromic autism (Lintas & Persico, 2009 ).",

            "text": "The SHANK3 gene is located on chromosome 22q13.3 which encodes for a scaffolding protein found in the postsynaptic density complex of excitatory synapses binding to neuroligins. Recently, two studies have reported a correlation between mutations affecting SHANK3 and an autism phenotype characterized by severe verbal and social deficits (Durand et al., 2007; Moessner et al., 2007) . Of the seven patients reported with the SHANK3 gene mutations, five were deletions, one was a missense, and another a frameshift mutation. In addition, rare SHANK3 variations were present in the autism group, but not in the control group. These variations were inherited from healthy parents and they were present in unaffected siblings, perhaps demonstrating incomplete penetrance. Another interesting observation is that in both studies (Durand et al., 2007; Moessner et al., 2007) , the SHANK3 deletion was inherited via a paternal balanced translocation. Further, in both studies, siblings of the probands with SHANK3 abnormalities had partial 22q13 trisomy that resulted in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Moessner et al., 2007) and Asperger's syndrome with early language development (Durand et al., 2007) . Like neuroligins, SHANK3 mutations are very rare. However, because of the robust genotype-phenotype correlation reported in two studies (Durand et al., 2007; Moessner et al., 2007) , it has been recommended that children with severe language and social impairment obtain SHANK3 mutation screening (Lintas & Persico, 2009 ).",

However, in this study, missense mutations also occurred in first-degree relatives who displayed heterogeneous phenotypes such as hyperactivity, depression, and learning problems. Incomplete penetrance may explain these findings, or autism may be caused by neurexin acting synergistically with other susceptibility genes. Neurexin-1\u03b1 is being intensely studied in mice as deletion in this molecule resulted in increased repetitive behavior, whereas social behavior was relatively intact (Etherton, Blaiss, Powell, & Sudhof, 2009 ).

Several genome-wide scans of individuals with autism have been reported and evidence in favor of linkage has been determined for the majority of chromosomes (Gupta & State, 2007) . The trouble with these studies is that the evidence has not reached statistical significance and there is lack of replication for many of these findings. Statistical significance is calculated by a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score. This score represents the logarithm of the likelihood ratio of observing the data under a model of linkage to observing the data under a model of free recombination (no linkage). An LOD score of 3.5 in a sib-pair analysis is considered to be a significant linkage (Lander & Kruglyak, 1995) . Suggestive linkage is an LOD score of 2.2, and a highly significant LOD score is 5.4. For replication studies, the replication threshold is considered to be 1.4 (Lander & Kruglyak, 1995) .

Genomic scan linkage analysis was performed on 109 autistic sibling pairs from 91 AGRE families together with analysis of those pairs from an independent sample of 345 families from the same AGRE cohort (Cantor et al., 2005) . When families with autism were stratified into only those with affected males, there was significant linkage at 17q11-21 in both samples. The LOD score for this replicated work was at genome-wide level of significance (LOD score > 1.4). One positional candidate gene close to this region is the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) which codes for a protein controlling the reuptake of serotonin in the synapse. This was exciting as elevated levels of serotonin have been determined in 25-30% of cases of autism (Cook et al., 1990) . Indeed, relationship between the SLC6A4 site and a repeat polymorphic region in its promoter region (5HTTLPR) recently has been independently investigated (Losh et al., 2008) . The chromosome 17q locus, however, has not been uniformly observed in subsequent, large-scale studies (Schellenberg et al., 2006) which may be due to phenotypic heterogeneity.",

Equal amounts of DNA from patient and control are hybridized to known regions of the human genome pre-arrayed on a slide. If patient and control have equal copy numbers at a given locus, the color turns yellow, representing an equal measure of DNA.

Several investigations have found strong linkage of SLI to chromosome 13q21 (Bartlett et al., 2002; 2004) and to chromosomes 16q and 19q (SLI Consortium, 2002 , 2004 . This finding is noteworthy as it directly overlies the 16q locus linked to autism (Wassink et al., 2004) . A specific language marker, age of first word, has shown significant linkage to chromosome 7 observed by five separate investigators (Losh et al., 2008) . The 7q region has been the subject of intense investigation, as described above, and may be the loci associated with autism language.",

(2003) identified two factors underlying RRB as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R): repetitive sensory motor actions and resistance to change.

The guidelines are dynamic rather than static and have been updated, for example, as aCGH has become more available. The stepwise approach was designed to balance cost with the expected yield of the tests. Further, there is a pyramidal effect so that \"earlier tiers have a greater expected diagnostic yield, lower invasiveness of testing, better potential of intervention, and easier overall practicality\" . Summarizing the diagnostic yields expected for the following investigations (high-resolution chromosome studies, 5%; aCGH -beyond that detected by chromosome analysis -10%; fragile X, 5%; MECP2, 5% women only; PTEN, 3% if head circumference >2.5 SD; other, 10%), it was predicted that utilization of these guidelines would lead to diagnosis in 40% of cases (Schaefer, Mendelsohn, and the Professional Practice and Guidelines Committee (2008) . Finally, this stepwise approach has met the approval of third-party payers and families (Schaefer & Lutz, 2006 ).",
