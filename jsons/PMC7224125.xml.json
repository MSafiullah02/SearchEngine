Thus, people treated early with ART have been hypothesized to be able to induce a protective immune response able to control their viral reservoir after therapeutic vaccination, since the reservoir is smaller and less adapted. This is also supported by the notion that up to 10\u201315% of people treated early may be able to maintain viremia at undetectable or low levels after cessation of ART (post-treatment controllers) without the need for any immune intervention10,11. While the precise mechanisms that lead to post-treatment control are still elusive and may differ from the mechanisms involved in spontaneous control of HIV, it seems plausible that host immune response induced during primary infection and preserved by early ART may have a critical role in the capacity of these people to contain viral rebound12.",

Vaccination in this study (RV405) included a four-shot vaccination regimen using vaccines with two different viral vectors, Ad26 (adenovirus) and MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara), that express two multivalent mosaic immunogens from the HIV proteins Gag, Pol and Env; the vaccines were given twice each over a period of 12 months. These novel mosaic immunogens were designed in silico to increase the vaccine coverage of potential T cell epitopes in circulating viruses and aimed to tackle the diversity of HIV type 1 and limit the virus\u2019s ability to escape immunosurveillance. In previous experiments in a non-human primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus, mosaic vaccines, given alone or in combination with an immune modulator TLR7 agonist, showed both a delay in viral rebound and a significant reduction in the viral setpoint after interruption of ART, in animals treated early13,14. Notably, in the non-human primate study, time to viral rebound and viral setpoint correlated with levels of vaccine-induced T cells, which supports the clinical testing of this strategy.",

During an exploratory ART-interruption phase, the 17 participants in the active arm showed a statistically non-significant delay in the time to viral rebound from 21 days, compared with the 15 days to viral rebound for those on placebo controls (Fig. 1). All people, except one placebo recipient, had to resume treatment as per the protocol, since they met the criteria for two consecutive determinations of viremia >1,000 copies per ml, 1 week apart. As the authors concluded, the trend in delayed rebound was too short to positively affect clinical management of the infection, but it partially reproduced the delayed rebound observed in the non-human primate model.",

            "text": "Still, despite the modest clinical effect, we feel that a number of lessons can be learned from the study by Colby et al., especially with regard to future trial design and possible readouts in the cure field. First, the question of whether a placebo group is indeed needed for scientific validity in pilot studies involving such unique and scarce HIV groups that also present an almost-universal viral rebound15 and for which efficacy comparisons among groups cannot be sufficiently powered. Second, stratification by HLA genotype upon randomization between arms might be necessary to limit the potential effects of host genetics on the results, as highlighted in the present RV405 study. As alluded to by the authors, the conservative ART-resumption criteria used in the study here may have blunted the possibility of detecting any potential post-rebound control of the virus after an initial phase of transient viremia. Such post-rebound control may occur only after vaccine-induced memory T cell responses are first re-stimulated by the rebounding virus to regain full effector functions and/or home to the relevant tissue to eliminate infected cells. Alternatively, innate immune mechanisms known as \u2018vaccinial effects\u201916 triggered by a transient viremia may also be required before the virus can be effectively controlled. Since more than 30% of cases of post-treatment control can occur after transient viremia higher than 10,000 copies per milliliter (ref. 11), more-relaxed ART-resumption criteria may need to be employed to offer those entering an analytic treatment interruption (ATI) the possibility of achieving an effective post-rebound control16. However, elevated levels of viremia over a prolonged period of time also considerably increase the risk for viral transmission during ATI, and any such approach would require effective risk mitigation to avoid such transmission.",

However, it remains to be determined whether the lack of control of the virus may have been due to still-insufficient stimulation of immune responses, inadequate response profiles, lack of reservoir mobilization, limited coverage of autologous viruses or the expansion of T cell and B cell responses to irrelevant targets in the virus. Comparison analyses of sequences of pre-existing and rebounding viruses, known as \u2018sieve effect\u2019 analyses, as well as detailed characterization of host immunity before ART initiation and during ATI, will hopefully help to elucidate the mechanisms that determine the rebound kinetics.",
