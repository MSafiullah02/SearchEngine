Additionally, RSV-related emergency department visits for infants aged \u2264 1 year of age range from 39 to 69 per 1000, and RSV-related office visits are 3 times as many [4] . Although many risk factors for severe disease are recognized, such as prematurity, congenital heart disease, pulmonary disease, and neurologic and immunosuppressive conditions, the majority of infants brought to medical attention are healthy full-term infants. Host and environmental factors also associated with more severe disease, although less overt, are male sex, lack of breastfeeding, tobacco smoke exposure, and low levels of maternally derived protective antibody [5] .",

Because CD4 T cells are critical in the development of adaptive immunity following infection and also influence the degree of inflammation, we sought to investigate gene expression patterns using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of isolated CD4 T cells in healthy full-term infants aged <10 months at the time of primary RSV infection by comparing infants with mild and severe clinical disease.

A birth cohort, enrolled between August and December of both 2012 and 2013, were followed by a combination of passive and active surveillance for development of RSV infection during the subsequent winter. Infants with respiratory symptoms were evaluated at home for RSV infection using an RSV group-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay [19] . A second cohort was enrolled when seen for acute respiratory symptoms in pediatric offices or emergency rooms and tested for RSV by antigen detection (Quidel, San Diego, CA) and/ or RT-PCR. The third cohort consisted of infants hospitalized with RSV at URMC's Golisano Children's Hospital. Eligible subjects were full-term (>36 wk gestation) healthy infants born after the previous May 1 and aged <10 months at RSV infection to ensure primary infection. The hospitalized infants were seen daily until discharged, and charts were reviewed for signs of respiratory illness and lowest room air oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ).",

Activation of NRF2 (NFE2L2), the major antioxidant pathway, was also associated with CD4 + T-cell gene expression in severely ill infants. This analysis also suggested activation of a number of regulators of mitogenesis, including MYC, KRAS, KIP1 (CDKN1B), and p53 (TP53). Together these data support the conclusion that broad changes in CD4 T-cell activity and survival are associated with clinical severity in RSV-infected infants. In fact, some observed gene expression changes specifically implicated responses associated with CD4 T-cell subtype, such as regulation of IL-9 signaling ( Figure 2B ). Also noted were increased activation of JAK2 and increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes in CD4 T cells from severe subjects, particularly SOCS2, which antagonizes the other SOCS proteins, and together with JAK2 regulates early Th1/Th2 differentiation [24] [25] [26] . In an effort to directly test whether severity-associated changes in gene expression were consistent with alterations in T-cell subtype, we implemented Bayesian estimation of transcription factor activity to predict transcription factor activity based upon CD4 gene expression patterns associated with severity [23] . We found changes in GATA3 activity were predicted to be significantly associated with severity as defined by the univariate model (P = 1.62E-05), whereas RORA was marginally significant (P = .04) and STAT1/2/4 and SMADs were not significant (P > .05). GATA3 is a transcriptional activator that is required for T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation. It also plays a role in differentiation of Th9 cells. These data support the interpretation that changes in CD4 T-cell subtype differentiation are associated with severity in RSV infection.",

            "text": "Our data indicated severely ill RSV-infected infants displayed greater activation of prolactin signaling in CD4 T cells. Prolactin, a polypeptide hormone originating from the pituitary gland, has been shown to bind to the prolactin receptor expressed on CD4 T cells and to have a variety of effects on CD4 T cells [27, 28] . Prolactin induction of T-bet transcription through phosphorylation of STAT2 and STAT5 is inversely dose dependent, and it has been suggested that exposure of CD4 T cells to high levels of prolactin might reduce Th1 function [27] . Another study found that Treg cells express prolactin receptor and exposure to prolactin inhibited their suppressive effect on Th1 cells in vitro [28] . Interestingly, it has been reported that infants with severe RSV disease admitted to the intensive care unit had significantly higher serum prolactin levels than moderately ill infants [29] . The JAK2 cytokine and JAK/STAT signaling pathways are integral to the production of the innate type I interferons IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, and thus it is not surprising that these pathways are differentially expressed according to disease severity. Confirming that such an effect is detectable in circulating, purified CD4 T cells is novel. It is known that the RSV NS1 and NS2 proteins block type I effectively via degradation of the transcription activator STAT2 [30] . The SOCS genes are included in the JAK/STAT pathways, and the SOCS2, SOCS3, and SOCS5 genes were all overexpressed in the severely ill subjects. It has been reported that SOCS3 is expressed during Th2 immune responses and in vitro experiments after exposure of murine respiratory epithelial cells to RSV [31] . Both STATs and SOCS are key regulators of T-cell differentiation, maturation, and function [32] . Similar to STATs, SOCS may cross-regulate one another, and the proteins are differentially expressed in Th cell lineage [33] . SOCS1 and SOCS3 favor Th2 and Th17 differentiation, and SOCS2 favors the differentiation of Th17 by the compensation of Th2 differentiation [34] [35] [36] . It also was not surprising to find that the PI3K/AKT pathway activation was increased in severe RSV disease. PI3K signaling is thought to have an important role in CD4 T-cell differentiation and function, including Tregs [37] . Respiratory syncytial virus has been shown to rapidly activate this pathway, which is associated with inhibition of cellular apoptosis as well as increased inflammatory cytokine production [38] . Interleukin 9, a Th2 cytokine produced by CD4 T cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils, has been found in the upper and lower airway secretions of infants with RSV bronchiolitis at relatively high levels but has not been previously correlated with disease severity [39, 40] . In a murine model of RSV infection, depletion of IL-9 enhanced clearance of virus from the lungs, and the authors concluded that IL-9 promoted a Th2-type inflammatory response [41] . Together, our data are supportive of a model where shifts in CD4 T-cell subtype toward a Th2 phenotype are associated with severity of illness in RSV-infected infants. Further studies, particularly in larger and more heterogeneous populations, will be required to confirm this observation and to determine whether these changes are mechanistic or are purely a result of the illness itself.",

Although we did not use a formal severity scoring system to define disease severity in our population, we believe that the clinical criteria selected provided a valid separation of mild and severe disease. The use of sorted CD4 T cells, rather than whole blood, and RNA-seq are unique aspects of this study and add to the existing gene expression literature. A potential limitation of this method is that some of the findings might have been affected by manipulation of the CD4 T cells during purification and sorting. However, and critically, identical procedures were used for processing samples from all subjects, regardless of disease severity. All blood samples were collected between 8 and 10 am, kept at room temperature, and processed immediately. Therefore, any impact of sample processing should be applicable to all subjects and result mostly in limitations of sensitivity. In summary, we were able to identify a number of differentially expressed genes and gene pathways involved in primary RSV infection in full-term healthy infants that are associated with increased disease severity. The results may help to ultimately identify potential biomarkers of severe disease and provide putative intermediate, molecular phenotypes of disease that can be assayed using experimental in vitro or in vivo infection models of RSV.",
