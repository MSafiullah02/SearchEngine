Therefore, it is important to remember that the \u201cabsence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence.\u201d An observation during the 2003 SARS epidemic was that droplet and fomite transmission was far easier to study than airborne transmission,19 yet airborne transmission did occur.20 As epidemiologic information evolves, basic questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be answered.

Neck protection helps decrease the droplet contamination shown to occur in this area.38,39 We recognize that neither neck nor head protection is included in the current WHO15 or PHAC37 guidelines for high-risk AGMPs. While the airway managers\u2019 wrists are easily decontaminated through requisite hand-washing both during and after the doffing procedure, the neck and head areas are not. The neck area has been identified as a zone of high contamination during simulated airway management AGMPs.38,39 While the head and neck do not contain mucous membranes, they are in close proximity above and below facial mucous membranes. If contaminated, these exposed areas could serve as a source of further contamination both during the PPE doffing process or afterwards during clothing removal. This is particularly true when removing other clothing in an over-the-head fashion (e.g., surgical scrubs or sports bras). Therefore, we propose head and neck covering, when done properly in a coordinated manner with other PPE equipment, could potentially reduce the risk of subsequent self-contamination by reducing the amount of skin exposure and contamination at the outset while preforming high-risk AGMPs. We also advocate for the availability of resources to allow healthcare providers access to shower facilities after directly participating a high-risk AGMP, if possible. While a post-doffing shower has not been studied, there is likely little harm.",

Nevertheless, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation currently recommends that (assuming the patient is not already tracheally intubated) during chest compressions, the same PPE be used as for other AGMP, which is currently identified as airborne, droplet, and contact precautions.44 Defibrillation, a time sensitive intervention, should be considered during the donning of high-risk AGMP PPE. An automated chest compression device (e.g., LUCAS Chest Compression System; Stryker Medical, Portage, MN, USA) should be considered to decrease healthcare provider exposure.45 Therefore, the minimum amount of PPE worn by all providers during cardiac arrest resuscitation should consist of airborne, droplet, and contact PPE. If any airway management is required, those directly involved and unable to step away (or out of the room) should don PPE with airborne, droplet, and contact precautions for high-risk AGMPs.45",

As such, it may be useful for healthcare providers who cannot be fitted with an N95 respirator. Nevertheless, some healthcare providers also don an N95 respirator inside the PAPR to help reduce self-contamination during the doffing process, or to maintain protection against airborne viral inhalation after doffing outside of the patient room in the absence of negative pressure or negative flow isolation. Again, we recommend liaising with local institutional IPAC personnel to inform these types of decisions.
