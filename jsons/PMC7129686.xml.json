However, our data suggest that, in adults, infections are very common and often asymptomatic or associated with mild self-limited symptoms. This discrepancy may be due to several factors. First, we assessed viremia rather than infection within the allograft. It may be that the two sites of infection behave very differently in terms of symptomatology and clinical consequences. Second, used active molecular surveillance techniques, which are more likely to pick up sub-clinical cases, as compared with symptom-based diagnostic evaluation. Third, we did not assess pediatric patients, who may be more likely to have newly acquired adenovirus in the absence of pre-existing immunity. Therefore, it should be emphasized that, although no significant clinical effects of low-level viremia were observed, patients with higher viral loads may well have more severe disease or an association with rejection.",

In 58% of these patients viremia was asymptomatic, whereas in the remaining patients viremia was associated with self-limited respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.
