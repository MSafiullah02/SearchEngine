These infections are often unrelated to the primary cause of hospital admission and can present even after the hospital discharge of the patients [42]. As per the CDC criteria for surveillance, nosocomial infection sites can be of 9 types affecting over 35 infection sites that can be differentiated on the basis of microbiological and clinical criteria [11]. Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are more vulnerable to nosocomial infections. The Extended Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC II) study showed a prevalence of infections within the ICU as high as 51% [82]. Nosocomial infectionsare associated with worse outcomes including increased length of hospital stay, long-term disability, and increased mortality rate, and are associated with increased antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance [42]. Due to the multiple risk factors like immunosuppression, disrupted skin and mucosal barriers, recurrent hospital visits, exposure to multiple antibiotics, and the presence of invasive lines and other devices, cancer patients, irrespective of whether they have solid or hematologic malignancies, are at high risk for nosocomial infections [20]. As cancer patients are increasingly being admitted to ICUs for management of disease- and treatment-related complications, the incidence of nosocomial infections is also increasing in ICUs caring for cancer patients [5]. The common nosocomial infectionsare catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), surgical site infections (SSI),and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This chapter will focus on VAP, CAUTI, and SSI, and central line-related bloodstream infection will be dealt with separately.",

These agents may be commensals in the patient or may originate from an exogenous source and spread via cross infection. Hospital-acquired pathogens are often resistant to most antibiotics (multidrug resistant) or at times extremely drug resistant or pan drug resistant, thereby increasing the treatment costs, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance. This is evident from microbiology data demonstrating an increasing incidence of nosocomial infections that are caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria over the years [19, 86]. The common pathogens are gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Acinetobacter and gram-positive bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and Enterococci. Invasive candidal infections also occur in those with indwelling catheters, lines or contaminated abdominal surgeries [66]. The other common nosocomial organisms are Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, anaerobes, and Enterobacter.",

The risk of VAP is highest during the initial days of ventilation (3% per day), which gradually decreases over time (2% per day from fifth to tenth day and 1% afterward). Older data suggested that most of the VAP episodes occurred in the initial part of ICU stay itself (early VAP) probably because of the increased practices of short-term ventilation in majority of patients [27]. Recent studies however suggest the converse with an increase in the late VAP rates (as much as 66% of total VAP) [32].",

The stomach is an important source of bacterial colonization. Change in the acidic pH of the stomach due to drugs favors colonization with these virulent bacteria, and with regurgitation of gastric contents, they pool in the oropharynx and reach the lower respiratory tract by micro-aspirations. The risks are further increased in the absence of adequate cuff seal or with multiple attempts of intubation. These virulent bacteria are usually difficult to treat owing to the thick biofilm that they produce alongside the endotracheal tube. The presence of this biofilm hampers antibiotic penetration and increases antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance [31, 39].",

The duration of hospital stays before intubation, length of ICU stays, and duration of ventilation are also significant as they determine the nature of flora causing VAP (see Table 3). VAP before 4 days (early-onset VAP) is often caused by microbes similar to the organisms causing community-acquired pneumonia like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), and susceptible Enterobacteriaceae [50]. Late-onset VAP is usually caused by microbes from the hospital environment. They are usually the aerobic gram-negative bacilli like Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and E. coli, while MRSA is rarely implicated [50]. The odds that they are multidrug resistant is high, and hence these infections are more difficult to treat. This difference between early and late VAP may not always be clinically relevant, and there are increasing reports of lack of difference in microbiology and mortality across both groups [21, 26]. Patients who are previously exposed to healthcare environment such as those who received antibiotics within the preceding 3 months, those who are currently hospitalized for more than 5 days, those who are on immunosuppressants, or those who have immunosuppressive states such as chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, AIDS, etc. are prone to multidrug-resistant infections irrespective of the onset of VAP.

These signs are highly nonspecific and may be also associated with various noninfectious causes. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of routine ICU X-rays is much lower than the conventional X-rays. Interobserver variability in interpreting X-ray findings also affects their accuracy as a diagnostic tool. Hence the diagnosis of VAP in ICU lacks sensitivity and specificity and may result in both over diagnosis or underdiagnosis. However, if the clinical suspicion of pneumonia is high, empiric antibiotics should be administered immediately as delay in antimicrobial treatment leads to increased mortality [38, 49].",

Bronchoscopic techniques like BAL, mini-BAL, and protected specimen brush (PSB) specimens provide reliable lower respiratory tract samples, and quantitative cultures of these samples may help to differentiate colonization from true infections. Technically it has the advantage of identifying the pathogens correctly, leading to less antibiotic exposure and thereby minimizing antibiotic resistance. However, bronchoscopy and sample collection require expertise and still result in false negative reports. Blind sampling requires less expertise and infrastructure and is easy to perform. However, blind sampling is likely to produce false positive results with colonizing organisms, thereby increasing inappropriate antibiotic use and promoting antibiotic resistance. The available data remains conflicting with no benefits of one method over the other with respect to mortality, length of ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation days [10, 75]. The IDSA recommends blind methods of sample collection, while the European guidelines recommend bronchoscopic-directed methods [40, 78].

Procalcitonin, a precursor hormone of calcitonin, is actively produced by neuroendocrine cells in the lung and intestine on exposure to bacterial endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines. The level peaks at 6 h and may aid in early identification of infections as compared to blood culture. Procalcitonin is not useful in cases of viral or fungal infections and in cases of localized bacterial infections. It is also elevated in noninfectious conditions such as burns, major surgery, end-stage renal failure, etc. [84]. Procalcitonin testing is expensive and serial measurements make it even more expensive. Based on the current data, procalcitonin levels should not be used to rule out an infection or influence the decision of antibiotic initiation. The main role of procalcitonin is in its role as a guide for early stoppage of antibiotics, thereby preventing unwanted exposure to antibiotics [9, 84]. The current guidelines do not recommend the use of these biomarkers over clinical criteria for a diagnosis of VAP [40, 78].",

MRSA coverage is not usually required, unless there is an increased risk for MDR organisms such as recent antibiotic exposure, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) prior to the current episode of VAP, acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy, or in case of high infection rates of MRSA in the hospital, i.e., >10\u201320%. In patients without risk factors for gram-negative MDR infection, such as those without any structural lung disease or those who have not received antibiotics in recent past, a single antipseudomonal agent that also covers MSSA will be appropriate. Only in patients with underlying structural lung disease like bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis or those having higher risk for MDR infection, dual antipseudomonal coverage should be given [40]. Recommended empirical antibiotics are those with antipseudomonal and MSSA activity such as ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, carbapenems such as meropenem or imipenem, etc. Aminoglycosides are not recommended as monotherapy for VAP. In case MRSA is suspected, linezolid or vancomycin may be used. With the increased incidence of infections due to MDR gram-negative pathogens, there has been a resurgence of polymyxins in the treatment of VAP. They may be particularly useful in places with increased baseline MDR Acinetobacter rates [40] and for empiric therapy in patients with septic shock or high risk such as neutropenic patients or those who have hypersensitivity to beta-lactams. Current evidence suggests that different doses or dosage schedules might be required for various bacteria, depending on the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters [28]. The IDSA guidelines recommend the addition of nebulized colistin along with intravenous route for managing VAP [40]. Regarding newer antibiotics, daptomycin is inactivated in the lungs and hence is not recommended for VAP. Tigecycline monotherapy in the doses as per the label is not recommended for HAP or VAP [40, 78]. Doxycycline and fosfomycin have not been studied for hospital-acquired MRSA as standalone treatments [64, 73]. Antibiotics should be changed according to culture and sensitivity reports and may be administered for a total duration of 7 days, or fewer, perhaps guided by procalcitonin levels. The European guidelines for VAP recommend a total treatment duration of 7\u20138 days for all immunocompetent hosts in the absence of complications such as empyema, lung abscess, or necrotizing pneumonia, if initial empiric therapy was adequate and their response to treatment has been good irrespective of the microbiological etiology. Patients infected with Pseudomonas, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter, those on antibiotics such as tigecycline and colistin, and immunocompromised hosts will require a prolonged duration of treatment [78].",

Hydrophilic drugs like beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and colistin attain less concentrations in the lung even after administering of therapeutic dose, while linezolid, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides concentrate well inside the lung.

The lack of improvement in clinical condition and/or clinical parameters such as fever, tachypnea, oxygenation, etc. after initiation of treatment can be either due to poor response to treatment/persistence of infection or due to a secondary infection. Typically, non-resolving pneumonia is common in elderly patients or in those with comorbidities, underlying immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or infection with virulent/drug resistant pathogen. Treatment factors such as inappropriate initial therapy (either drug or its dose, route, frequency, and duration) are other important factors responsible for VAP. Workup for non-resolving pneumonia should be undertaken, including microbiological workup for MDR pathogens and imaging for complications such as lung abscess or empyema, while ruling out noninfectious causes of fever and radiologic infiltrates. Once an infective etiology is confirmed, optimizing antibiotics as per the pk/pd principles with a hike in antimicrobial coverage will be needed to manage non-resolving pneumonia [51].",

VAP rates can be reduced by proper decontamination of ventilatory equipment and practice of infection control measures during care of the mechanically ventilated patient. A brief outline of the steps to reduce VAP is given below.I.\nGeneral Infection Control Measures\nAdherence to the five moments of hand hygiene as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [88]. Avoiding intubation and re-intubation by the judicious use of noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen helps reduce the risk of development of VAP.Preferring the use oral route than nasal route for intubation, thereby reducing the chances of nosocomial sinusitis and VAP.Avoid routine stress ulcer prophylaxis as alteration in gastric pH is associated with increased microbial colonization in the stomach.Enteral feeding reduces the gut translocation of endogenous bacteria and reduces bacteremia. Caution should be taken to avoid overdistension of the stomach and monitor gastric residual volumes if there are signs of feed intolerance.Daily oral hygiene with 0.12\u20132% chlorhexidine gel reduces the pathological colonization of oral flora. Its role is supported by evidence of multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials which are open-labelled trials [47]. Role of selective decontamination of the gut is controversial in areas with high antibiotic resistance.\nII.\nReduction in Aspiration Pass the Cuff\nElevation of the head end of the bed by 30\u201345\u00b0 has shown to reduce VAP rates significantly and is recommended by many professional societies [58].Continuous low-pressure suction of the subglottic secretions above the endotracheal cuff is useful [52].Silver-coated endotracheal tubes may prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation though the current evidence is weak.[53]III.\nVAP Bundle\nThe term \u201cbundles\u201d in critical care refers to collective group of practice statements, each with high level of evidence in itself; when practiced together, they result in better patient outcome by the consistent delivery of these practices and avoidance of individual preferences or practices [34, 43]. Infection surveillance, hand hygiene, semi-recumbent positioning, early extubation, ensuring adequate cuff pressure, and continuous subglottic suctioning have been proven to be simple and efficient methods that help to reduce VAP rates significantly [17]. The initial VAP bundle suggested by IHI comprised of five components: head end elevation of bed, daily interruption of sedation combined with assessment of the likelihood of weaning, prophylaxis for stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis, and daily oral care with chlorhexidine [33]. Table 6 represents the suggested practice from Scottish intensive care society [18]. They differ from the classical Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) VAP bundle by not suggesting peptic ulcer prophylaxis or DVT prophylaxis as they have no direct relation with VAP rates.",
