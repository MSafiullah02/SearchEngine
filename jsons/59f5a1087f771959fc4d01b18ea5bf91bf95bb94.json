            "text": "The current coronavirus disease pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to immense strain on healthcare systems and workers. Patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with acute neurological emergencies such as ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke in these patients may result from COVID-19 related complications or decompensation of previously asymptomatic cerebrovascular disorders, or concurrent ischemic stroke from common stroke risk factors in a patient with COVID-19. Acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions require emergent triage, intensive care, and mechanical thrombectomy. Management of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) requires special considerations in the current pandemic. Physicians must now account for prognosis of severe COVID-19, resource utilization, and risk of infection to healthcare workers when determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Here, we describe important prognostic factors including age, laboratory, and imaging findings to consider for MT selection and provide suggestions for taking care of patients with LVO and possible or confirmed COVID-19. It is recommended to perform MT in patients within the established guidelines, and consider a conservative approach in cases where there is clinical equipoise to minimize futile reperfusion. Lastly, we describe an illustrative case of a patient with ischemic stroke and COVID-19.",

High rates of transmissibility, primarily through airborne droplets and aerosols and international travel, have led to a worldwide pandemic. The United States (US) leads the world in the number of COVID-19 cases, and there are growing concerns regarding the potential strain on its healthcare systems due to the intensive care needed for critically ill COVID-19 patients (2) . Initial reports from other countries have already highlighted the stress of COVID-19 on their intensive care units (ICU) and resources (3) . A recent case series of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Seattle, Washington reported a median ICU stay of 14 days and a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 10 days (4) . With emergency departments and ICUs triaging and caring for increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, there is little doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a tremendous impact on available resources for the triage and treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Here, we present an overview of COVID-19, recommendations for acute stroke care and treatment, and provide an illustrative case study of stroke in a COVID-19 positive patient.",

Males are more likely to have severe symptoms and have a higher rate of mortality than females (6, 7) . In a study of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 patients in China, 80% of those who died were 65 years or older (8) . Patients between 60 and 69, 70 and 79, and above 80 years of age have a mortality rate of \u223c4, 10, and 21%, respectively (5, 9) . Patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU have mortality rates of \u223c26% (7) . Furthermore, patients with co-morbidities are considered high-risk, specifically those with hypertension (10). Of 1,625 deaths in Italy, 25% of patients had one co-morbidity, 25% had two, almost half had three or more co-morbidities, and <1% of patients did not have any co-morbidities (5) . Shared risk factors for stroke and severe COVID-19 include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (11) (12) (13) . In a Chinese study of 191 patients, hypertension (OR 3.05; 1.57-5.92), diabetes (OR 2.85; 1.35-6.05), and coronary artery disease (OR 21.4; 4.6-98.7) were independently associated with death from COVID-19 (10) . Another study revealed that those with cardiovascular disease and an elevated troponin had a mortality rate of 69% (14) .",

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) benefit from mechanical thrombectomy (MT) within 24 h from \"last seen normal\" time (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) . Although the use of intravenous tPA for AIS has not been studied in patients with COVID-19, its use is imperative for eligible patients with AIS. Given the current crisis, selection of patients for MT poses new challenges and requires refinement of established protocols. Recently published recommendations from the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) recommend that MT should be performed in patients in which there is high-quality data to support benefit (56) . The decision to perform MT in patients outside established guidelines should be pursued in the context of resource availability and balanced against the risks and benefits to the patient as well as the treating health-care providers.",

Pre-hospital screening for symptoms of COVID-19 should be performed by the 911 dispatcher. EMS implements region-specific bypass protocols for patients with suspected large vessel occlusion. Pre-hospital notification allows for room and team preparation. Immediate lab draws and bedside testing for COVID-19 in CT suite followed by routine stroke imaging; if suspected COVID-19 or unable to obtain history, consider CT chest. If there is clinical equipoise, patients should be managed conservatively. For patients with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19, consider prognostic scoring. Early discussion of treatment goals may be appropriate for patients with severe COVID-19 and a high risk of mortality. For patients selected for MT, consider intubation in a negative pressure room before transferring to the neuroangiography suite. longer hospital stays, increased need for post-acute care and longterm skilled facility beds, and increased long-term cost of care and resource utilization (56, 66) . With appropriate precautions, MT for patients younger than 80 years with LVO and suspected COVID-19 who may potentially benefit is a reasonable approach. In patients younger than 80 years with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19, use of pre-treatment thrombectomy scores such as HIAT2 (67), THRIVE (68) , and PRE (69) in conjunction with COVID-19 predictors may provide important insight to guide discussions of treatment goals and expectations of longterm clinical outcome (See Figure 1 for proposed algorithm for patients with suspected LVO).",

The patient was identified by bypass protocols to have a suspected LVO based on the Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation (RACE) score and was brought directly to our comprehensive stroke center. Initial pre-hospital page from emergency medical services (EMS) identified the patient as suspected COVID-19 positive with recent respiratory symptoms as well as \"RACE positive.\" On arrival, the patient was met by one nurse, CT technician, and physician in PPE. In addition to neuroimaging, a CT chest (Figure 2 ) was performed which revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. Vascular imaging revealed a distal right MCA M3 branch occlusion with matching infarct, and labs revealed an elevated troponin (0.26), elevated AST (50), bilirubin (1.3), LDH (523), CRP (27) , ferritin (393), and procalcitonin (2.2). Given the lack of clinical-core mismatch, reperfusion therapy was not offered. The patient required intubation and within 2 days, the patient passed away from respiratory failure and shock. CONCLUSION COVID-19 has placed an unprecedented strain on healthcare systems and resources. Our review summarizes the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and provides prognostic features of severe COVID-19 infection to help determine the risks and benefits of performing MT. While the provided algorithm accounts for many considerations for MT in the current climate, the decision to perform MT is complex and should be individualized. Furthermore, there is a lack of literature on outcomes of MT in LVO patients with COVID-19 and these opinions are based on expert views and anecdotal reports.",
