Acceptable positive culture specimens included sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or blood. Patients were excluded from consideration as having community-acquired pneumonia for the present study if one of the following health care-related risk factors were present: hospitalizations to a health care facility in the preceding 12 months; residence in a nursing home; or dialysis patient.

The strains were tested for the presence of the PVL gene and the arginine deiminase (arcA) gene using a multiplex PCR assay (41). The isolates were characterized by SCCmec typing (42,43), staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing (44) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (45).

Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in Universal Transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, USA) to maintain the integrity and viability of the respiratory viruses during transport to the laboratory. Influenza A and B viruses were individually detected using a singleplex real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR to each of these agents. The primers, probes and cycling conditions have been previously described (47). Testing for the respiratory viruses, ie, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza types 1 to 4 and adenovirus, was performed using the Respiratory Viral Panel assay from Luminex Molecular Diagnostics (Abbott Laboratories, Canada). For patients for whom no NAT was performed and banked paired serum samples were available, stored serum samples were forwarded to the National Medical Laboratory for testing of antibodies to influenza A and B using a hemagglutination inhibition assay performed according to standard techniques (48). All sera were pretreated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corporation, USA) to reduce nonspecific agglutination. The highest serum dilution to show an absence of agglutination was the titre recorded.",

One isolate (Patient 1) was a USA300 genetically related strain, which had a similar PFGE pattern to USA300 and carried PVL, arcA and SCCmec IVa and shared the same MLST ST8 profile but with a slightly different spa type t818 (spa repeats YHGFMB instead of YHGFMBQBLQ in a typical USA300 strain) (Figure 1). The remaining isolate (patient 9) was a PVL+, ST30-spa t019-SCCmec-IVa strain belonging to USA1100, a commonly encountered community-associated strain in South America (49). Interestingly, all of these 10 isolates were PVL positive and carried CA-MRSA-associated SCCmec type IVa (Figure 1). The majority (90.0%) of the strains were resistant to beta-lactams, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin but susceptible to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, tetracycline, gentamicin and vancomycin (Table 2). Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for all clinical isolates of MRSA using the Vitek II AST-GP67 susceptibility card (bioMerieux Canada). All isolates had minimum inhibitory concentrations <1.0 \u03bcg/mL. Eight patients were tested for viral infection with either NAT or serology. For the other two patients, testing was not performed due to the absence of obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen or the lack of stored serum samples. Viral testing results are summarized in Table 3. In eight of 10 patients, documentation supporting the presence of any concomitant viral infection at the time of admission could not be found. At the time of admission, none of the 10 cases had a nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viruses performed. In all cases, a comprehensive review of the patient charts revealed no clinical history or records to support the presence of a viral-like illness preceding the CA-MRSA pneumonia.",

Severe cases of CA-MRSA necrotizing pneumonia have been reported worldwide in adult and pediatric series (25,32). Although previous studies have suggested a relationship between CA-MRSA pneumonia and preceding influenza or other viral respiratory illness (25\u201327,51), a viral etiology for community-acquired pneumonia cases is not always investigated (52,53). Few studies have considered the role of S aureus in non-influenza-associated pneumonia as outlined by Kallen et al (31). The results of our case series suggest that severe CA-MRSA pneumonia may occur in the absence of antecedent influenza or other viral respiratory infection. Our findings are corroborated by another recent retrospective analysis, in which 15 cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia were described as having no relationship to a preceding influenza infection (54). In this study, viral testing was performed on all 15 patients using either the rapid influenza test or influenza viral culture, and only one was positive.",

Our findings showed that the majority of our patients required chest tube placement (70.0%), revealing the virulent capacity of MRSA. The mortality rate was 20.0%, which is comparable with a previously reported case series of CA-MRSA without previous viral infection (54). In all our cases, MRSA was the only bacterial pathogen identified that was associated with the initial presentation. All 10 of the isolates harboured the PVL gene (Figure 1) and had the SCCmec type IVa element.

Our results may be limited due to chart accuracy for documented influenza-like symptoms. We based our selection on the available description of onset of symptoms as detailed in the admission notes. We acknowledge that in some cases there may have been incomplete charting or that only positive findings were noted and that no record of a previous viral-like prodrome or investigations for viral illness does not preclude their presence. The lack of any viral testing for two of our patients did not allow us to fully assess the role of a possible viral infection in these cases. In addition, we acknowledge that we did not test for additional respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses and rhinoentero-viruses, but they were not routinely available at our centre.
