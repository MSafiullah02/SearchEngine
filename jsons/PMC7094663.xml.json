Replacement rearing represents 15 to 20% of total dairy production costs (Heinrichs, 1993). Therefore, health disorders among replacement stock significantly affect the sustainability of the dairy industry. Calf preweaning morbidity and mortality rates have been reported to be high (about 35% morbidity and 2.1 to 14% mortality) in several countries (Mee, 2013; NAHMS, 2014; Windeyer et al., 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, no data have been reported on calf morbidity and mortality rates in Australian dairy farms.",

The primers Fw (5\u2032-AGTGCTCGTTTACGACCTGAA-3\u2032) and Rv (5\u2032-TGATCGATAATGCCAGACGA-3\u2032) were designed to amplify a 229-bp DNA fragment. The PCR mix was prepared with 5 \u00b5L of extracted DNA, 18 \u00b5L of 0.4 mM each primer, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 2.5 U of REDTaq DNA Polymerase (Sigma Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia), and 5 \u00b5L of 10\u00d7 REDTaq PCR Reaction buffer (containing 11 mM Mg2+; Sigma Aldrich) in a final total volume of 50 \u00b5L. After an initial denaturation step (94\u00b0C, 5 min), PCR was performed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 20 s, with a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Double-distilled water and DNA extracted from a Salmonella Typhimurium strain (provided by the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Charles Sturt University), were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, in each PCR. The resulting PCR products were read through conventional electrophoresis in a 1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel and SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel staining (Sigma Aldrich). The PCR-positive samples were subsequently classified into O-antigen groups. Briefly, 50 \u00b5L of the buffered peptone water pre-enriched fecal 1:10 dilution was plated in Salmonella-specific medium (CHROMagar Salmonella Plus; CHROMagar, Paris, France) and incubated for 24 \u00b1 2 h at 37 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Salmonella-typical colonies were subjected to serotypification using commercial monovalent anti-sera. A drop of antiserum was mixed with several colonies on a glass slide with an inoculating loop. After 10 s, the agglutination reaction was assessed visually by holding the slide in front of a light source against a black background. Only sera against Salmonella O-groups B (Salmonella O:6, 7, 8 Monovalent Antiserum; Bio-Rad Laboratories Pty Ltd., Gladesville, NSW, Australia), C (Salmonella O:4,5 Monovalent Antiserum; Bio-Rad), and D (Salmonella O:9 Monovalent Antiserum; Bio-Rad) were selected for analysis, because these represented the species of Salmonella most commonly isolated from calves in Australia (Izzo et al., 2011b).",

Duplicate plates containing colonies within the range of 30 to 300 were used to calculate mean colony forming units per milliliter in the original samples. Cut-off points of 100,000 and 10,000 cfu/mL for TBC and TCC, respectively, were used to classify samples as satisfactory or unsatisfactory (Godden, 2008).",

Elevated colostral TBC and TCC not only act as a vehicle for the transmission of organisms but also represent a significant risk for FTPI by decreasing the efficiency of absorption of immunoglobulins (Johnson et al., 2007; Gelsinger et al., 2015). The harvesting stage has been suggested as the point at which the majority of contamination is most likely to occur (Stewart et al., 2005). However, we observed a great variation among farms in the proportion of colostrum samples meeting all quality standards, with an average of 19.3% and a range of 0.0 to 83.3%, suggesting farm-specific factors influence the degree of colostrum contamination. Hence, veterinarians are required to conduct further investigations on each farm to identify where contamination is likely to occur. The prompt refrigeration of colostrum (within 1 h of collection) and thorough disinfection of the calf-feeding apparatus before use have been recommended to reduce bacterial contamination (Phipps et al., 2016).",

Our survey found that 23.6% of respondents let calves suck colostrum from their dams and 71.6% separated calves from their dams >6 h after calving. In fact, 41.8% of respondents separate calves >12 h after birth. Relying on the calf sucking colostrum from their dam and late separation are known to increase the prevalence of FTPI (Besser et al., 1991; Vogels et al., 2013).

The high prevalence of FTPI we observed not only affects calf health but is also likely to have a significant economic impact on the farm.

This practice allows for monitoring of adequate immune transfer and can be easily performed at the farm using various methods (Abuelo and Alves-Nores, 2016).

The majority of respondents (71.7%) diagnosed diarrhea themselves; only 17.9 and 7.6% of the farmers reported that the diagnosis was made by a veterinarian through either a visit or a conversation, respectively. Furthermore, 55.8% of farmers did not regularly require veterinary consultation for the treatment of NCD, and 33.0% of respondents always administered antimicrobials for cases of NCD. Although a larger proportion of farmers (49.1%) reported using antimicrobials only when the calves were systemically ill, following the current recommendation (Constable, 2004), an important proportion of farmers still administered antimicrobials as a blank treatment for NCD. This results in the use of antimicrobials when they are not needed and generates reservoirs of resistance among both commensal and pathogenic bacteria (Catry et al., 2016). Increasing awareness among farmers about the judicious use of antimicrobials for treating NCD is required.",

            "text": "In addition, 63.2% of respondents systematically withheld milk from calves with NCD: 29.7% did it for at least 24 h and 7.6% until the calves recovered from NCD. This was consistent with the finding that 55.7% of respondents fed oral rehydration solutions instead of milk or milk replacer to calves with NCD. Previous studies demonstrated weight loss in calves fed only oral rehydration solutions, compared to weight gain in those that received milk in addition to oral rehydration (Fettman et al., 1986; Garthwaite et al., 1994). Indeed, even hypertonic oral solutions (with a high concentration of glucose) cannot provide sufficient energy for maintenance and growth (Constable et al., 2001). However, the severity or duration of diarrhea is not different between calves that receive milk in addition to oral rehydration compared with oral rehydration alone (Garthwaite et al., 1994). Thus, it is currently recommended to continue feeding milk to calves with NCD and only to withhold it for periods up to 12 h in severe cases (Smith, 2009; Lorenz et al., 2011; Smith and Berchtold, 2014). The labels of most commercially available rehydration products in Australia were updated in 2014 to instruct farmers to continue the administration of milk-based products when using oral rehydration electrolytes (APVMA, 2018). Based on the results of this survey, however, many farmers still need this information. In Europe, legislation details the minimum requirements for commercial oral rehydration products for calves (European Commission, 2014), but this is not the case in other countries, including Australia and the United States. Significant variability in the quality of commercial oral electrolyte solutions available in the United States and Australia has been noted (Smith, 2009; Vogels, 2010). Veterinarians need to be proactively involved in establishing guidelines for the use of specific oral rehydration products.",

These results from on-farm collection were consistent with the results of the survey, which also found Cryptosporidium spp. and Salmonella spp. to be the most common enteropathogens. The within-herd prevalence of each pathogen varied considerably among farms in the pilot study (Table 4\n). For example, the TP of Cryptosporidium spp. and Salmonella spp. varied between 0.0 and 100.0% (mean: 44.1% and 27.5%, respectively) and the TP of coronavirus ranged from 0.0 to 57.2% (mean: 13.3%). The ELISA pathogen identification assay we used detects Cryptosporidium spp., but data worldwide show that Cryptosporidium parvum is the most common species found in calves of this age (Geurden et al., 2007; Langkjaer et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2007). Reports from Europe, the United States, and Australia indicate that Cryptosporidium spp. are among the most common enteropathogens isolated in cases of NCD, with a prevalence ranging from 15 to 59% (de la Fuente et al., 1999; Bj\u00f6rkman et al., 2003; Uhde et al., 2008; Gulliksen et al., 2009; Izzo et al., 2011b). Furthermore, several studies indicate that infection rates in young dairy calves with Cryptosporidium parvum are as high as 100% in some herds (de Graaf et al., 1999; O'Handley et al., 1999, Olson et al., 2004; Abuelo, 2016), which we also observed in the present study. Only one drug, halofuginone lactate, is currently licensed for the prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in calves in Australia. However, some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of this drug to treat established Cryptosporidium infections (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009; Trotz-Williams et al., 2011). Therefore, enhancing calf immunity and reducing the exposure of the calves to the pathogen through appropriate management and hygiene practices are key to reducing the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in calves.",

This O-group includes Salmonella Dublin, which is the most common serovar identified in calves from this antigenic group, and an important serotype due to its ability to create a long-term carrier status with intermittent shedding (Nielsen et al., 2004). Salmonella O-groups B and C were identified in 10 (17.9%) and 6 (10.7%) PCR-positive samples, respectively. These serogroups include the serovars Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Bovismorbificans as the more common serovars identified in calves (Grimont and Weill, 2007). Two PCR-positive samples from the same farm were negative to all the O-groups tested and subsequent serotypification was not undertaken. Similar data were presented in an earlier Australian report, which identified Salmonella Dublin as the most common serovar, followed by Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Bovismorbificans (Izzo et al., 2011a). Cryptosporidium parvum and Salmonella Typhimurium are known to cause disease in humans and they were identified in 40.9% and 5.4% of samples from diarrheic calves, respectively. These findings highlight the zoonotic potential of NCD with approximately half of the cases being caused by zoonotic agents. Therefore, the need for personal protection must be reinforced to people in contact with calves to prevent infections. Indeed, outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis associated with an epizootic in calves have been reported (Reif et al., 1989), and it is estimated that about 1 in every 6 human cryptosporidiosis cases comes from animals, calves (both beef and dairy) being the most common animal sources (Cacci\u00f2 and Putignani, 2014).",

In our study, rotavirus was the third most commonly isolated pathogen, with a TP of 19.1%, lower than the 79.9% reported by Izzo et al. (2011b). However, this difference might be explained by the source of the samples; compared with the previous study, our samples did not originate from outbreaks of NCD, in which mixed infections are common (de la Fuente et al., 1998; Uhde et al., 2008; Smith, 2012). Similarly, the TP of E. coli F5 (13.9%) was lower than in other studies, some of which reported prevalences up to 75.6% (El-Seedy et al., 2016). However, NCD caused by E. coli is most prevalent within the first 4 to 7 d of life (Foster and Smith, 2009), so age differences among studies might explain the variation observed in the prevalence of E. coli NCD. Indeed, only 42 of the 202 fecal samples (20.8%) came from calves younger than 1 wk of age, and the TP of E. coli in this subgroup reached 69.0% (data not shown). Coronavirus was the least prevalent pathogen in the present study (TP = 7.4%). Several studies have also reported low prevalence of coronavirus in NCD, with documented prevalence ranging between 7.8 and 14% overseas and 21.6% in Australia (Reynolds et al., 1986, de la Fuente et al., 1999; Uhde et al., 2008; Gulliksen et al., 2009; Izzo et al., 2011b). Neonatal calf diarrhea caused by rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli can be effectively prevented by vaccinating dams before calving to increase specific immunoglobulins in colostrum (Kohara et al., 1997). Nevertheless, only 22.6% of survey respondents reported vaccinating dams for this purpose. Therefore, calf health could be further improved by vaccinating dams during the dry period and ensuring that calves receive adequate amounts of good-quality colostrum in a timely manner.",

            "text": "The majority of respondents (89.6%) fed fresh whole milk to their calves; a small proportion fed milk replacer alone (7.5%) or whole milk supplemented with milk replacer (2.8%). The supplementation of whole milk with milk replacer aims to provide high-energy, high-protein feed in a smaller volume than would otherwise be required to achieve a similar nutritional content if using whole milk or milk replacer alone, thus allowing optimal growth rates to be achieved without the need to feed high volumes of milk (Dairy Australia, 2017a). Nevertheless, the mean (SD) volume of milk/milk replacer fed to dairy calves up to 2 wk of age and from 3 wk onwards was 4.4 (1.47) L and 6.1 (2.11) L, respectively. The Australian recommendations for milk volume to be fed to calves is 10% BW (Dairy Australia, 2017a). Preweaning nutrition and thus preweaning ADG has lasting effects on subsequent lactation and reproductive performance (Kertz et al., 2017). The volumes of milk fed by the majority of respondents were representative of conventional restricted milk feeding programs (Drackley, 2008). Calves under these programs show lower ADG, greater risk of disease, and achieve first service later than calves fed under an intensive feeding program (Curtis et al., 2018). On the other hand, restrictive milk feeding programs allow for weaning at an earlier age than intensive feeding programs (Drackley, 2008). However, the mean (SD) age at weaning in our survey was 79.1 (28.45) d, similar to the mean (SD) weaning age of 10.2 (2.53) wk reported by Phipps et al. (2018), but higher than the 8 wk recommended for intensive feeding (Eckert et al., 2015). Nevertheless, several other factors, such as concentrate intake and weight, need to be considered when deciding when to wean calves, and this might explain the differences in weaning age compared with North American dairy systems. Indeed, it is important to consider that most of the previous studies of calf-feeding programs were performed in different dairy production systems; further research is needed to determine the benefits and cost-effectiveness of calf intensive feeding programs in the Australian pasture-based system.",

Early evidence reported that these practices resulted in no differences in growth or morbidity compared with control milk (Kesler, 1981). However, they have been associated with higher levels of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the gastrointestinal tracts of calves (Aust et al., 2013; Duse et al., 2015). Also, feeding mastitis milk to calves is a risk factor for heifer mastitis (Parker et al., 2007; Ivemeyer et al., 2009).

Feeding devices can serve as fomites for pathogen transmission. Indeed, 73.8% of the farms using calf feeders used the same feeder in multiple pens, without cleaning feeders (40.6%) or using only water (13.2%) between pens. Calves that share feeding devices have a higher odds of respiratory disease (Svensson et al., 2003; Lundborg et al., 2005), which can be due to the transmission of pathogens via the use of the same nipple. The median (SD) number of teats per feeder was 6 (5.72) and 14 (17.29) up to 2 wk of age, and from 3 wk of age until weaning, respectively. Thus, the opportunities for disease transmission between animals via feeders are considerable if appropriate sanitation and disinfection practices are not in place.",

            "text": "Calves were housed for an average (SD) of 36.8 (28.53) d after birth. We observed considerable variation in housing type for preweaned heifers. A closed barn (calves totally inside) with calves kept in groups was the most common housing method (51.9%), followed by an open barn (calves have free access to outside; 19.8%), a patio barn (calves kept inside with a restricted area open to outside; 17.9%), and individual hutches (11.3%). Calves being kept totally outside (4.7%) or kept individually inside a closed barn (2.8%) were the least common housing methods. For animals kept in groups, the size of the groups varied considerably. The median (SD) maximum number of calves per pen was 10 (10.71), with a range of 4 to 80 calves per pen. However, 86.4% of respondents did not keep calves of different ages together in the same pen, and although male calves were housed in the same shed as female calves by 54.7% of respondents, 44.8% kept them in separate pens in the same sheds. Also, 54.7% of respondents reported having at least 1 pen designated for sick animals on their farm, and 17.0% had a sick pen in each calf facility. Nevertheless, 76.4% of the farms did not have solid partitions between pens, which facilitates nose-to-nose contact and disease transmission among animals in the same shed (Lago et al., 2006). Individual housing was used by only 14.1% of respondents, in contrast to with data from the United States, where approximately 70% of farms house preweaned heifer calves individually (NAHMS, 2014). However, group housing improves solid feed intake and calf weight gain, as well as calf behavioral aspects, without adversely affecting calf health in well-managed herds (Costa et al., 2016). Thus, although group-housed calves might be at a higher risk of disease transmission, the benefits associated with socialization likely outweigh this risk, provided calves are managed appropriately.",

The hygiene of the environment and frequency of cleaning are likely of greater relevance for disease transmission. Pens were cleaned only before the calving season by 36.2% of respondents, but cleaned weekly, fortnightly, and monthly in 17.5%, 28.8%, and 17.5% of farms, respectively. A substantial proportion of respondents (24.5%) selected a cleaning frequency that was not one of the main options given on the survey: 16.0% cleaned pens as needed through visual assessment, and 8.5% cleaned after each group or calf (individual housing).

Considering that Australia had 5,789 registered dairy farms in 2016 (Dairy Australia, 2017b), only 1.77% of Australian dairy farmers responded to the survey. However, the distribution of responses per Australian state in our survey was similar to the distribution of registered dairy farms (Dairy Australia, 2017b), so our results include the different dairy production systems present in the country. Nonetheless, self-selection bias is also inherent in these types of studies, so the results of the current study cannot be generalized to the entire target population. However, given the current lack of studies investigating dairy calf management practices at the Australian national level, this study provides useful information on what areas appear to need more attention by farmers, veterinarians, and extension agents.",

This recruitment method could have skewed results, because farms that knowingly have issues with NCD may have neglected to participate due to fear of scrutiny, although the study ensured confidentiality. Likewise, farms experiencing calf-related problems might have wanted to investigate them further at no cost. Selection bias could also have occurred in the fecal samples. We asked veterinarians to randomly collect samples from eligible calves. However, they could have consciously or unconsciously sampled the sickest-looking calves. This could have increased the percentage of samples positive for pathogens that cause more systemic clinical signs (e.g., Salmonella enterica). Linked information regarding management practices at the farms where samples were collected was deliberately not sought. This decision aimed to increase the willingness of farmers to participate in the study. This limited the capacity to investigate which factors were associated with poor colostrum quality, high rates of FTPI, or the prevalence of enteropathogens. However, these factors have been extensively investigated in the literature, and the objective of the study was to provide an estimation of the abovementioned parameters in the Australian dairy system.",

Colostrum management seems to be one of the most important areas to improve, because the prevalence of FTPI, the proportion of colostrum samples not meeting quality standards, and the proportion of farmers not separating calves from dams promptly were considerably high. Strategies to increase awareness of industry-recommended practices for calf management and feeding are needed. Further studies should investigate the drivers of dairy producers to implement these industry standards.",
