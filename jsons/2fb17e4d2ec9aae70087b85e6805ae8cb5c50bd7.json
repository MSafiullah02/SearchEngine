Yet the function of FliI 6 -FliJ complex -a homolog of the F 1 ATPase motor -within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear. We use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors to identify key features of this motor. The two states are the 'locked' ground state where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an asymmetric torsional potential, and a 'free' excited state in which FliJ undergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat transitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity of the FliJ filament within the FliI 6 stator: \u03c9 max \u2248 9.0 rps. The motor was then studied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its maximal power output: P max \u2248 42 k B T/s, and the stall torque: G stall \u2248 3 k B T/rad. Two modes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which the motor performs useful work either by continuously 'grinding' through the resistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In both cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the flagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that the function of the FliI 6 -FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier and therefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them into the transport channel.",

In general, this is achieved by proteins -long chains of amino acids that come in various sizes and shapes when folded in solution.

These large molecular complexes are responsible for organised powered movement within cells and can be characterised by the following properties. They consume energy (usually chemical energy stored in molecules of ATP, or in electrochemical gradient of ions across membranes) and transform it into mechanical work. The energy input is crucial to drive the system out of equilibrium. Another requirement to achieve directed motion is the presence of asymmetry (or broken symmetry) in the underlying potential governing the motion of the motor. Lastly, the microscopic nature of the motors and the surrounding heat bath means that their motion is inherently stochastic and is therefore subject to overdamped thermal fluctuations. a) Electronic mail: emt1000@cam.ac.uk Several types of motors are distinguished. Cytoskeletal motors move along polarised tracks defined by rigid filaments: myosin along actin fibres, while kinesin and dynein along microtubules. Polymerisation motors, on the other hand, output mechanical work by elongating themselves. In doing so they might, for instance, change the shape of the cell 4 . Lastly, rotary motors convert chemical energy into rotational motion and are the main subject of this study.",

It is difficult to overstress its importance in almost any living organism. The ATPase is embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. When sugars are burned in mitochondria, an H + ion gradient is set up across the membrane. The F 0 motor of ATPase then harnesses the electrochemical energy stored in this gradient to rotate one of its components 8 . In doing so, ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is converted into highly energetic ATP (adenosine triphosphate) at the expense of the H + gradient dissipation. ATP is subsequently used as the main fuel for thousands of reactions in the cell releasing ADP in the process. The other function of the ATPase is to recycle the ADP by phosphorylating it back into ATP by the F 1 motor of the complex.",

            "text": "However, each domain can function on its own. Thus, the F 1 motor can instead consume ATP to rotate the \u03b3-shaft against the F 0 , and force the H + ions across the membrane to build up their concentration gradient. Independent action of the F 0 motor has been extensively observed in-vitro [10] [11] [12] , and much useful information about the underlying molecular processes was obtained in this way. Although the hexamer structure of the F 0 (and its many homologues, such as V 0 -ATPase or FliI 6 complex) is very well known, the physical mechanism of the F 1 motor action is less clear. Some of the prevailing theories are based on the idea of a \"power stroke\" 13, 14 . In this model, an asymmetry in the \u03b1 and \u03b2 units of the F 0 hexamer complex pushes, upon conformation change, on the base of the \u03b3-shaft and thus exerts a torque. In fact, the majority of publications 15, 16 accept the notion of a constant torque being exerted by the motor, acting against friction, to justify the observed rotational velocity. However, this picture has several faults. Firstly, the scale of the system and the highly viscous environment surrounding the complex imply that it operates in the overdamped regime. This means that any inertial effects must be neglected. As a result, the picture of a \"turbine\" pushed by a stream of protons, or a shaft spun by a \"cog\" has to be replaced with a fully stochastic construction subject to Brownian motion. Secondly, high resolution measurements of the rotational motion clearly show the possibility of a reverse step 17 : a phenomenon that cannot be accounted for in the power stroke model. Lastly, numerous studies 7,17 use the false concept of torque generation to arrive at efficiencies close to 100%. This is, of course, at odds with classical thermodynamics and reversible Carnot engines. This all illustrates the lack of understanding when it comes to the F 0 -ATPase dynamics. Frasch et al. proposed that the rotation is partially derived from elastic energy stored in the \u03b3-shaft 18 . This idea was further developed by Kulish et al. into a stochastic two-level model 19 . Here we adopt this methodology and apply it onto a different molecular motor in the hope of predicting some of its properties.",

This motor is called the FliI 6 -FliJ complex, and it sits at the bottom of the export channel ( fig. 1 ).

The interaction of the \"tooth\" protrusions (fig. 2b) with matching grooves in the stator cavity ensures that the shaft can be in two states: one fixed, the other free to rotate.

Two more parameters remain to be addressed, one of which is the rotational diffusion coefficient D of the unrestricted FliJ filament, given by D = k B T /\u03b3 with \u03b3 the friction coefficient. Structural data 20 reveals that in living cells the FliJ shaft touches the side of the export channel, giving it a slight bend ( fig. 8a ). Here we simplify the problem and look at the two limiting geometries: an L-shaped bar and a tilted straight bar ( fig. 8b-c) . Rotating cylinder sets up a tangential flow around it, which has a \u221d 1/r velocity decay. The frictional coefficient is the proportionality constant between applied torque and rotational velocity. In a medium of viscosity \u03b7, for a cylinder of radius R rotating about its axis, this is given by \u03b3 = 2\u03c0R 2 \u03b7 per unit length. This can be used to calculate \u03b3 for the vertical part of the L shaped rod in fig. 8b .

The diameter of the export channel, d \u2248 2 nm implies that the flagellin subunits that eventually assemble into a flagellum outside of the cell need to be unfolded first in order to pass through such a narrow channel. Minamino 41 states that this is achieved with the use of proton motive force (pmf), and ATP activity of the FliI 6 -FliJ complex. It is not clear to us where the pmf could contribute to this process. On the other hand, several studies suggest 22,42 complex process of \"loading\" of the subunit into the channel by binding to chaperone proteins that assist in anchoring and unfolding of the subunit. It has also been shown that even in the absence of ATPase activity certain level of protein export was achieved 21 , suggesting that the motor is not critical for the export and merely assists in the process. We, therefore, propose that the purpose of the FliI 6 -FliJ motor complex is in the assisted unfolding of the substrate. This is achieved via direct mechanical interaction of the subunits with the rotating FliJ filament ( fig. 11 illustrating the point). The subunit, which is temporarily bound to the cavity, resists the filament movement, the associated counter-torque slowing down its natural rotation in the motor. The motor exerts an equal and opposite force on the substrate, helping it overcome the energy barrier and unfold (a number of studies give details of protein unfolding under force [43] [44] [45] .",

This counter-torque builds up tension in the subunit protein, until it unfolds with the help of other mechanisms such as chaperones 1,4 , or just stochastically 44, 45 . Mean first-passage time can be used to calculate the average time for such stochastic unfolding. In contrast, the grinding mode could occur instead, in which the motor continuously rotates (grinds through, or past the bound substrate) and supplies the additional energy to the unfolding. Using simple reaction kinetics, the unfolding rate r \u221d exp (\u2212E unfold /k B T ). We can approximate the additional energy supplied by the motor as \u2206E \u2248 \u03b4\u03c6G max \u2248 \u03c0G max /3 per step. So the overall unfolding rate is increased by a factor exp (\u2212\u2206E/k B T ) \u2248 4.8. This result is in very good agreement with experiments performed by Minamino et al. 46 and Paul et al. 47 , where the FliI ATPase was removed or damaged by a mutation. These papers report a three-and four-fold reduction in flagellar secretion, respectively, upon removal of the FliI 6 -FliJ complex. Our slight overestimate of the rate reduc- tion is mainly due to the assumption that all the work performed by the motor is utilised in unfolding the substrate (when there would naturally be losses). The agreement with experimental values shows that the proposed \"Brownian ratchet\" model is a viable alternative way of describing rotary molecular motors.",

Naturally, a possible next step could be to account for any internal degrees of freedom and transition from an overly simplified two-state model to an N-state model that captures the complex nature of soft matter systems more accurately.",

The power goes to zero at G stall when \u03c9 = 0. For each \u03c4 there is a maximum power attained. Taking \u03c40 as the reference, the values are G stall \u2248 3 kBT rad \u22121 ; Pmax \u2248 42 kBT s \u22121",
