To do so, I bring together two intersecting events: the Chinese government's ban on wild animal markets during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and Chinese and European media frenzy over the visit to China by the Spanish football club Real Madrid in the wake of the epidemic. In discussing these events, I pay specific attention to unruly bodies-both human and nonhuman-as consumables and those who consume them. In examining translocal encounters of these unruly bodies, I suggest that, in post-SARS China, discourses and practices of consumption produce emergent socialities that at once refigure racialized Orientalist tropes and conjure up discrepant neoliberal imaginaries of lifestyle and consumer choice.

Differences, as anthropologists have argued, have not disappeared because of \"globalization\" (Rofel in press; Tsing 2004) . Neither can differences be readily relegated to the realm of the receding past and out of our anticipations of futures. As Michael Fischer puts it, the current age is not one of the erasure of the past through the various postmodern tactics of late capitalism, and \"legacies of the past continue to haunt, constrain, reroute, and interact with the present\" (2003:7) . Fischer and others have embraced the concept of the \"emergent\" to talk about the increasing complexity of interactions and differentiations in everyday life today. Donna Haraway, for example, argues that an analysis of emergent \"naturecultures\" would take into account \"vulnerable, on-the-ground work that cobbles together nonharmonious agencies and ways of living that are accountable both to their disparate inherited histories and to their barely possible but absolutely necessary joint futures\" (2003:7) . In this article, I take the emergent seriously: Rather than focusing solely on the new, I foreground the contested ways in which dynamic imaginaries of pasts and futures interact to create various emergent socialities. Neither necessarily utopic nor dystopic, these entangled, effervescent socialities not only deserve critical analytical attention but also are conditions with which many of us live.",

            "text": "Focus on such emergent socialities and the bodily encounters enabling them allows me to critically examine technologies of consumption and discourses of consumer choice as a means of intervening in discussions of neoliberalism. Analyses of neoliberalism have counted the emergence of the consumer-subject-self-regulating, choice-savvy-pivotal to the workings of neoliberal governmentality (Rose 1996 (Rose , 1999 . Nikolas Rose, for example, argues that neoliberal discourses of consumption locate an individual \"within a certain form of life\" through the identification of consumables and those who consume them (1999:86) . Whereas Rose highlights the discursive and transformative nature of consumption in the production and transformation of the self, I want to complicate our understandings of consumption by foregrounding its viscerality. Feminist anthropologists have long argued against the prevailing vision of corporeal bodies as prediscursive: Instead, they see these bodies as intimate projects and processes of subject formation that produce multiple, fractured selves through politics of desires, emotions, and pleasures. At play in these projects and processes are contestatory practices of race, gender, class, and other imaginaries of difference (Alexander and Mohanty 1997; Butler 1993; Ebron 2002; Kondo 1990 Kondo , 1997 Rofel 1999, in press; Stoler 2002) . Drawing on these insights, I here emphasize that the visceral is already discursive. In examining consumption-aseating and (conspicuous)-consumption-as-spending, I suggest that, through bodily encounters of various humans and nonhumans during and after SARS, the uneasy conflation between these two types of consumption have refigured Orientalist tropes, while at the same time positioning them vis-\u00e0-vis neoliberal discourses of lifestyle and consumer choice. 2 I am, therefore, not only interested in bodies at large but also, specifically, in both human and nonhuman bodies as \"consumables\" (Rose 1999:87) . However, rather than assigning the consumables to \"the world of goods\" that shapes the consumer-subject within \"the sphere of self\" (Rose 1999:85) , I want to understand consumption-in its visceral and discursive dimensions-as heterogeneous and unruly discourses and practices that foreground and challenge the pervasiveness and seamlessness of neoliberal discourses of subject formation. I suggest that, although seemingly discrepant, both the banning of wild animal markets and controversies surrounding Real Madrid's China tour-especially the frenzy from the Chinese public, as well as Chinese and European media, over the star player David Beckham-are dense moments of translocal encoun-ters through which consumption, as a set of heterogeneous visceral and discursive practices, proliferates. Furthermore, these bodily encounters and proliferating practices of consumption provide occasions for the (re)production of a set of contested hybrid identities and subjectivities. At stake in the production and representation of Chinese bodies of both human and nonhuman sorts are not just imaginaries of China's past but also visions of cosmopolitan futuresfutures that depend not so much on the transition to a new stage of consumption, globalism, or neoliberal governmentality as on situated, contestatory projects and processes out of which unruly subjectivities and identities emerge. I hope to understand these unruly emergences by taking a close look at the proliferation of consumables and those who consume them-as well as their historical entanglements and displacements. I begin with stories of two banquets and the unruly human and nonhuman bodies they brought to the table.",

This bodily incommensurability, once in place, sets Beckham and his teammates apart not only from the grasshopper but also from their Chinese hosts.

Sina.com did not list the menu in their exhaustive coverage of the Real Madrid tour; they simply mentioned that the banquet included \"local delicacies,\" a term that usually carries an exotic flavor. 4 Whether the menu was real or fabricated, these stories themselves draw my attention: Why did exotic animal food become a centerpiece in the media coverage of a sports team's commercial tour? What I am interested in is the heterogeneous, sometimes competing, ways in which particular hybrid bodies and subjectivities are produced through encounters generated by projects and processes of marketization and consumption. In popular and academic discourses, \"consumption\" has been a particularly relevant point of entry into descriptions and understandings of transformations in postsocialist China.

Tourism again became favorite weekend and holiday activities after the Chinese government lifted the ban on interregional traveling, once-empty shopping malls were filled with bustling crowds scouring for things to buy, and restaurants were busy making up for the business lost during the SARS outbreak.",

Once the beautiful qipao-clad receptionist chaperoned us around the fish tank, I found myself in a spacious \"exhibition hall.\" In the middle of the hall was a large table where vivid plastic samples and price tags of main dishes were displayed. A deli was set up on the left side of the hall, where various cold appetizers were showcased.

Among competing explanations for the origin of SARS, the hypothesis of zoonotic origin, meaning \"animal-borne origin,\" was most strongly favored by research scientists in and outside of China and, furthermore, was the theory most widely spread through mass media, the Internet, and rumors. In late April 2003, at the height of the SARS outbreak and under mounting international criticism for its lack of action, the Chinese Forestry Administration and the Chinese Industry and Commerce Administration announced the banning of hunting, selling, purchase, transportation, importexport, and marketing of all \"wild animals\" with the exception of necessities for scientific research (People's Daily 2003) . The term wild animal, however, was both vague and all encompassing. Without any clear definition of which animals were considered \"wild\" and why, the \"farmed tiger frog\"-another delicacy and one of the best sellers at live animal markets-was singled out as the only \"wild animal\" exempt from the ban (People's Daily 2003) . Moreover, although land animals-including most amphibians-were strictly banned, the status of freshwater and marine animals was less clear. Restaurants in Shanghai, for example, stopped serving drunken seafood-a culinary method in which small, live freshwater or marine animals such as shrimps and clams are dumped into a pot of rice liquor and then eaten almost immediately. Whether an animal was \"wild,\" it seems, also depended on whether it was raw or cooked for consumption.",

However, the isolation of the civet cat as the animal host of the SARS virus did not ease the ban on-or lessen people's fears of-other \"wild animals.\" It was only in August 2003, well after the last SARS patient was released from the hospital, that the ban was relaxed to exempt Chinese deer, African ostrich, turkey, scorpion, and a total of 54 assorted land animals (Chinese Forestry Administration 2003) . Most of the animals on the list were commercially farmed. Many were exotic or novel food items. The Chinese Forestry Administration explained that the rationale for their exemption was that the farming technologies for these animals were \"mature\" enough so that they could be domesticated and bred \"for commercial purposes\" (2003, emphasis added)-even as the administration admitted that there was no guarantee of control of germs that could potentially jump species.",

To the contrary, I suggest that, through the act of banning certain animal foods and markets during the SARS outbreak, the \"wild\" was marked with a set of heterogeneous meanings specifically and intimately related to, if not produced by, human consumption-consumption in its visceral and discursive dimensions.

In what follows, I argue that it was during a medical, social, and political crisis of potential global scale that the \"wild\" took on contingent and contested forms through a variety of actions that were at once biological, political, legal, historical, social, transnational, and visceral. Elusive and heterogeneous, the \"wild\" emerged as a temporary point of convergence in discourses of SARS and, as I will show, at the same time resisted any identification of it as the readily accessible point of origin of the SARS epidemic. To make this point, I first turn to the competing origin stories of SARS, with a focus on the perhaps most sensational actor in these stories: the civet cat.",

Although, contrary to the claims of the article, the elimination of wild animal markets did not eradicate SARS, the Chinese government immediately responded to the new SARS case by announcing the plan to slaughter 10,000 more civet cats (Bradsher and Altman 2004) . What, I wondered, makes the civet cat Public Enemy No. 1 in the battles against SARS, in spite of obvious possibilities of alternative origins and routes of transmission?",

            "text": "To begin, SARS was indeed a very bad disease for biomedicine. Between November 2002 and the end of the epidemic in June 2003, an estimated 8,422 people in over 30 countries were infected with various strands of the virus, and 916 died as a consequence (WHO 2003) . However, given that the 11 percent mortality rate of SARS is slightly above that of the influenza, SARS was nowhere near a plague and the panic over SARS seemed to have bordered on paranoia. This panic was compounded by the fact that, even as more and more people fell sick and died, biomedical science was late in coming up with an authoritative explanation or effective treatment. Scientists were not able to identify the virus as a novel coronavirus until April 2003, 7 five months after the appearance of first clinical cases (Holmes 2003) . Even now, there is no effective treatment, definitive prognosis, or reliable preventive measures against a potential future outbreak. In fact, scientific communities around the world responded in diverse ways to the question of what should be done when facing such a rapidly spreading epidemic that threatened to reach a global scale. Whereas some labs immediately delved into the sequencing of the SARS genome (Peiris et al. 2003; Webster 2004) , others rushed to develop a vaccine (Marshall and Enserink 2004) . In the second case, some scientists conceded that, first, it would be extremely difficult to develop an effective vaccine given the unusually high evolving rate of the coronavirus; second, even if scientists managed to produce a vaccine, it would take a second large-scale outbreak to test whether the vaccine actually works (Marshall and Enserink 2004) . In short, SARS called into question the efficacy of biomedicine in containing infectious diseases and threw into sharp relief the uncertainties and frailties of the standardized tools and narratives that produce and authorize biomedical knowledge. 8 However, the \"inadequacy\" of biomedicine was not the only factor that fueled the anxiety and paranoia over SARS. 9 It is noteworthy that speculations over the origin of SARS did not simply originate from the lab or the Chinese government but had entangled roots in repercussions of recent world events. The sudden explosion of media coverage of SARS in and especially outside of China coincided not with the outbreak of the epidemic, but with the U.S.led invasion of Iraq at the end of March 2003. Although some earlier speculations in and outside of China suspected the natural and nonhuman origin of SARS, others spoke of biological weapons: Was SARS a mysterious biological weapon? (News24.com 2003) . Rumors of SARS being a \"foreign\" biological weapon spread through Chinese websites, and some claimed that the novel and highly unusual virus was designed to target Chinese genes (Tong 2003) . Debates about the origin of SARS continue until today-for example, whether the virus jumped from animals to humans or the other way around-long after the story of the civet cat as the animal culprit prevailed in research communities and mass media.",

The possibility of respiratory transmission of SARS was emphasized by several different sources. In May 2003, the WHO released a conference report claiming that the major mode of transmission of SARS was respiratory, although the potential for infection by ingestion must also be considered. Medical professionals on the ground also noted that infection rates were much higher at high-tech locations such as hospitals with centralized ventilation (Lee et al. 2003; Masur et al. 2003) . In China and Hong Kong, many of those who came down with SARS were doctors and nurses who worked at high-tech hospitals such as the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong and the People's Hospital in Beijing, both of which remained quarantined for months during and even after the outbreak. Some doctors and nurses who risked their lives fighting SARS declined to be interviewed on television; others agreed to be interviewed, on the condition that the interview would not be conducted at their home and that their faces would be obscured so that friends and neighbors would not recognize and avoid them.",

A doctor who worked at one of these wards told me that, on entering the ward, he did not know whether he would get out again. He explained, I volunteered for the squad [to combat SARS] in April, and stayed in the ward without going home for more than four weeks. The top floor of our hospital was quarantined for potential SARS patients. There were 15 beds in there. We had no idea how many beds we would eventually need. At one end of the ward were the patients' beds, at the other the beds for doctors. There were three beds in between that were kept vacant. When I checked on my patients, I wore two protection suits, three pairs of disposable surgical shoes, three masks, and a pair of goggles. Even so, I knew that I was still exposed to air when I used the stethoscope. I tried to use it as infrequently as possible. Otherwise I just had to take the risk.

[conversation with author, September 4, 2003] Although medical and everyday practices-such as wearing masks and frequent disinfection of surface areas with disinfectants, including vinegar-worked against multiple and especially respiratory routes of transmission, it was the civet cat that became the most infamous creature in the origin stories of SARS. In what follows, I focus on the one origin story that became ubiquitous and dominant in discourses of SARS-that of the civet cat and China's wet markets. 10 Why, among all the competing origin stories and suspected routes of transmission, did the civet cat draw the most intense scrutiny from researchers and media in and especially outside of China? Why does the civet cat, along with other \"wild animals,\" continue to be the target of aggressive government regulation and media controversies even after SARS? Why, while images of masked faces on magazine covers became symptomatic of the spread of SARS, 11 did scientific and popular discourses zero in on practices of China's wild animal markets in their narratives of origin?",

The story of the \"zoonotic origin\" of SARS was not only boosted by the identification of the SARS virus as a coronavirus similar to flu viruses but also by the speculation that the initial site of the outbreak was Hong Kong or the Guangdong Province of southern China, both famous for their bold appetites for exotic animal foods. Moreover, the first identified SARS patient was reportedly an animal handler who worked in the wild animal food markets in Guangdong Province . The argument about the link between human appetites and the nonhuman origin of the virus was further consolidated by reports of the discovery of large quantities of SARS antibodies among animal dealers in Guangdong . In May, research scientists in Guangdong and Hong Kong identified the civet cat, a delicacy in southern China, as the original animal host of the SARS virus (Guan et al. 2003) . In the meantime, research scientists pleaded for the immediate closing of wet markets in China and other Asian countries as a measure to stop SARS in its track and prevent future outbreaks (Guan et al. 2003) . These pleas were quickly and widely publicized in scientific and medical journals as well as through mass media in and especially outside of China. As discussed earlier, the Chinese government responded by banning the consumption of almost all wild land animals.",

Amid the stench of death and decay, traders of exotic animals-a culinary delight for many southern Chinese-haggle over prices with customers, occasionally turning their attention to their children, pinching their cheeks or tousling their hair. Narrow passageways are strewn with animal dung, urine, entrails and grimy fodder. \"What's there to be afraid of?\" asked Mrs. Huang, carrying her three-month-old daughter on her back. \"We have been working and living here for years and we have had no problems.\" A few steps away, men with iron pipes clubbed a dog unconscious and slit its throat. Others squatted around another dead dog, plucking it clean of hair with their bare fingers. Virologists believe that such markets in China and farms where people live in very close proximity to animals are fertile breeding grounds for disease and viruses. [ Reuters 2003] This excerpt is littered with interspecies bodily entanglements: \"cages tightly packed\" with various animals, human adults pinching the cheeks of their children and tousling their hair as they haggle over the prices of animals, narrow alleys strewn with animal parts, and a dead dog and humans who touch it with their \"bare fingers.\" These voyeuristic images of the \"local culinary tradition\" were then contrasted with and condemned by the sanitized, authoritative voice of an abstract \"virologist\": Unnatural interspecies bodily encounters breed disease and viruses. And the unnatural affinity with animals through eating, the stories go, lies in a Chinese way of life \"that has existed for as long as anyone can remember\" (Lynch 2003). As a logical consequence of this kind of reasoning, many scientists cautiously recommended the eradication of wet markets, while at the same time identifying Chinese people's culinary taste as a public health hazard and a deeply rooted cultural tradition that needed to be \"respected\" (Bradsher and Altman 2004; Nature 2004; Watts 2004:134; Webster 2004) .",

            "text": "These accusatory ambivalences and voyeuristic curiosities toward visceral entanglements of Chinese bodies of both human and nonhuman sorts should come as no surprise to my readers: Similar discourses plague wet markets and restaurants in Chinatowns in the United States. In his article \"Fish Stories: Environmentalist Disgust and the Viscerality of Race,\" Timothy Choy (1997) examines environmentalist discourses surrounding \"fresh kills\" in the wet markets of San Francisco's Chinatown and what he calls the \"racial signification\" of the accusation, \"You eat fish!\" He argues that the identification of the Chineseness of certain food practices begs a critical analysis of race that takes into account the visceral qualities of racial discourse. I find Choy's observations useful for thinking through similar accusations: You eat dogs! You eat civet cats! You eat grasshoppers! The proliferation of these \"you-eat-(animals)\"s in everyday discourse of Chineseness (and even Asianness) underscores the viscerality of racialized Orientalist tropes that produce various exotic Others through their excessive pleasures and enjoyments. In the case of scientific and popular discourses of SARS, we see the recurrence of a familiar narrative strategy that visceralizes the traditional and the uncanny as the origin of a culturally specific disease that-if not contained-threatens to destroy the global. The civet cat, in particular, became a protagonist in the origin stories of SARS because it conjured up familiar Orientalist representations in which the wildness and exoticness of Chinese bodies-of both human and nonhuman sorts-emerged out of visceral acts of consuming. Although these tropes are nothing new, I am intrigued, first, by their obsession with the viscerality of consumption, and the effectiveness of the visceral in producing racialized bodies, identities, and subjectivities. Moreover, I suggest that, while mass media and scientific representations constructed a visceralized ancient epicurean tradition of China as the \"real origin\" of the SARS outbreak, they also did so by locating narratives of excess squarely within the sphere of the market and mass consumption, which is not an emblem of \"ancient Chinese culture\" but a product of recent economic, social, and political transformations in China.",

Farquhar argues that the practice of excess in postsocialist China is a response to the general state of deficiency-if not hunger itself-of the Mao era. She further points out that such excess is often localized: Compared to the pervasive state of deficiency that characterized the Chinese state and society in general during the Mao era, the excess in consumption has so far been restricted to urban areas and the emerging middle class. It is no surprise, perhaps, that the SARS outbreak was at its worst in the prosperous Guangdong Province and the capital city Beijing. I am interested, then, in how persistent strategies of Othering are refigured for discourses and practices of middle-class lifestyle and consumer choice. I suggest that, in contrast to Orientalist representations that conjure up the familiar image of one uniformly exotic China, a closer look at the heterogeneous discourses and practices of consumption suggests a more elusive and fragmented picture of \"China\" and \"the Chinese.\" Rather than being emblematic of an anonymous \"Chinese culture,\" visceral practices of consumption in China today are intimately entangled in the emergence of an urban middle class. The rest of this article, then, is a preliminary examination of the ways in which competing visions, understandings, and practices of cosmopolitan bodies and subjectivities are produced in the wake of the SARS epidemic. Instead of discussing marketization and consumption strictly in terms of China's participation in the global domination of neoliberalism, I now want to focus on how competing visions and practices of the cosmopolitan are produced through consumption: in particular, the production of contested middle-class, cosmopolitan subjectivities mapped onto racialized, disciplined, healthy bodies.",
