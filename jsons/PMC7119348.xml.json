By May 15, 2003, the local case number had amounted to 1703, and a quarter of these cases were part of two major epidemiological outbreaks. The first took place at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, to which 156 SARS cases were admitted between March 11 and March 25, 2003.1 The second major outbreak occurred in the community, where 321 residents of the Amoy Gardens had been infected by April 15, 2003.2 The Amoy Gardens is a densely populated housing complex of ten 33-storey apartment blocks, with eight units per floor. The two outbreaks were characterised by the rapid spread of infection among individuals. Yet certain features in the disease spectrum differed between the outbreaks. The proportion of hospital patients reporting diarrhoea was 20% compared with 73% of Amoy Gardens patients.1, 3 The intensive-care unit admission rates were 23% and 32%, respectively, and the mortality rates were 4%1 and 13%, respectively. Although several mechanisms might account for these differences, sequence variations in the viral genome have been postulated.3 To investigate this possibility, we compared the viral genomic sequences obtained from representative cases of both outbreaks.",

The Prince of Wales Hospital outbreak was traceable to an inpatient who was among the first cluster of SARS cases in Hong Kong linked to a local hotel.1 The suspected Amoy Gardens index case was a man who attended the Prince of Wales Hospital regularly for haemodialysis (patient 1).2 He attended three haemodialysis sessions during the stay of the hospital-outbreak reference patient, and on the same hospital floor. 3 days after a haemodialysis session on March 12, 2003, patient 1 complained of fever, cough, and myalgia. Subsequently, on March 19, 2003, he lodged overnight with his brother, who lived in the Amoy Gardens complex. Patient 1 developed diarrhoea, and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. The number of Amoy Gardens residents diagnosed as having SARS rose strikingly after his stay, peaking on March 24.2 41% of cases were from the same block in which patient 1 stayed, many from the same or the adjacent unit. These two units shared a common ventilation light-well and a vertically linked faulty sewage system that were implicated as the environmental factors contributing to the outbreak.2\n",

These two patients had serological and virological evidence of SARS-CoV infection. Patients 2 and 3 presented initially with fever, myalgia, and malaise, and developed diarrhoea from days 3 and 4, respectively, after symptom onset. Patient 2 recovered, but patient 3 required intensive-care treatment and died. We did full genome sequencing for SARS-CoV on RT-PCR products of uncultured clinical materials: serum from patient 1 (isolate CUHK-AG01, GenBank accession number AY345986); nasopharyngeal aspirate from patient 2 (CUHK-AG02, AY345987); and stools from patient 3 (CUHK-AG03, AY345988; details are available at http://image.thelancet.com/extras/03let8014webappendix.pdf). We compared sequence data of the three viral isolates with the sequence previously obtained from the infected mother of the index case of the Prince of Wales Hospital outbreak (isolate Su-10, GenBank accession number AY282752; table\n). The table shows that only three nucleotide differences (at positions 3852, 11 493, and 28 696) were noted between patient 1 and the Su-10 sequence, which provides molecular evidence that patient 1 probably acquired the infection from the hospital. Two of these nucleotide changes did not result in aminoacid substitutions. The remaining one (at position 28 696) resulted in a change from cysteine to glycine, but this substitution is unlikely to be related to the distinctive clinical features of the Amoy Gardens outbreak because a glycine at this position is seen for many other SARS-CoV isolates, including the Tor2 and Urbani isolates (Table).4, 5\n",

The recurrent demonstration of the presence of this isolate among studied Amoy Gardens patients lends further support to the proposed environmental route of transmission implicated in the outbreak. Sequence variation in the SARS-CoV genome is not responsible for the distinct clinical features of the Amoy Gardens outbreak. Thus, further work should be focused on investigating the possible role of other unique features on this outbreak in explaining the clinical characteristics of this cohort.
