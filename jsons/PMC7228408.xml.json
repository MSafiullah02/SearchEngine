However, novel coronaviruses (nCoV) that crossover from zoonotic hosts possess unknown sensitivities to treatments and are a principal source of pandemic risk. The clinical effectiveness of treatments from the frontlines of an outbreak can be most informative; however, the options in such an environment are limited by the shallow global pharmacopoeia of general antiviral medicines.\n1\n Opportunities in this environment are further reduced by the limited inventory of antiviral medications produced by manufacturers and the accompanying supply chain optimization challenges that may delay the availability of drugs that show an early signal of efficacy. The emergence of 2019\u2010nCoV (officially named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) has demonstrated another challenge in the face of emerging nCoV outbreaks, specifically the incomplete evaluation of evidence of drug efficacy from prior nCoV outbreaks.",

In a systematic review of treatment options for MERS, the IFN\u2010\u03b2/ribavirin combination therapy was suggested on the basis of a positive risk\u2010benefit profile, whereas ribavirin monotherapy\u2010associated toxicity was noted and thus assumed to not likely provide sufficient benefit to outweigh the toxicity.\n47\n However, the most encouraging evidence for the progressive evolution of treatment is the demonstration of tolerability of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and IFN\u2010\u03b12a in a case study of MERS\u2010CoV, suggesting that this combination should be tested as a treatment for 2019\u2010nCoV.\n48\n, \n49\n\n",

The challenges in the evaluation of ribavirin efficacy from 2003 during SARS and the 2013 MERS outbreaks led to a summary evaluation of its utility as controversial in the treatment of COVID\u201019 patients. A large number of clinical studies and retrospective analyses that will come from the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak will put the controversy of ribavirin efficacy in a broader context. For ribavirin and myriad other treatments, both the clinical results and quality of evidence will reveal the challenges that face frontline physicians who treat patients in a medical setting and evaluate prophylaxis for novel high\u2010risk environments formed by large quarantined populations. The critical need for treatment and patient care in outbreak settings, on the frontlines of nCoV outbreaks, will place stress on any medical system and clinical research mechanism. However, controlled clinical studies are underway to permit a prospective evaluation of efficacy, and the government Treatment Plan Edition 5 and revised and prescribed usage guidelines distributed in China will assist in the comparability of multicenter experiences in retrospective analyses. The efforts of clinical research professionals will help both in this outbreak and future outbreaks of nCoV, which will possess unknown sensitivities to our antiviral pharmacopoeia.",
