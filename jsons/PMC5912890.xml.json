According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 30% of acute respiratory infections of viral etiology in the United States (roughly 47 million cases annually) are inappropriately treated with antimicrobial therapies that are not effective against viral pathogens [3\u20135]. Furthermore, it is estimated that a causative pathogen is identified in only approximately 40% of pneumonia cases overall, and a subset of these cases for which a pathogen could not be identified are likely of viral etiology [6]. A diagnostic capable of rapidly distinguishing between infections of viral, bacterial, or fungal etiology could inform the clinical management of individuals with respiratory infections, potentially reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics for viral infections [7, 8].",

Specifically, one must be careful when interpreting the results obtained from tests that specifically target organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or certain fungi (i.e., Candida), as up to 20% of healthy individuals can be asymptomatically colonized [10]. Several rapid, multiplex diagnostic tests for organism detection are commercially available [8, 11, 12], but their role at present is limited, since, in addition to the previously-mentioned shortcomings, they lack proper evaluation of their selectivity and specificity, mainly due to the absence of an indisputable gold standard techniques for the identification of many pathogens [8, 10\u201313].",

            "text": "To-date, most assays for the detection of respiratory viruses have focused on the identification of either virally-derived nucleic acids (e.g., multiplex PCR, such as PneumoVir\u00ae) or antigens (e.g., rapid influenza immunoassays, such as DirectigenTM EZ Flu A + B). Recently, however, volatile metabolites in exhaled breath have been investigated as potential alternative biomarkers for pathogen detection and identification. For example, volatile metabolites in breath are widely used in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori gastritis [14], and are under investigation for the diagnosis of both acute and chronic respiratory infections [15]. In the murine model, it has been shown that volatile metabolites can discriminate between respiratory infections caused by common bacterial pathogens, including H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae [16\u201318]. However, unlike bacteria, which produce distinct volatile metabolic signatures derived from fundamental differences in components of both core and secondary metabolism [19], viruses are entirely reliant on the metabolic machinery of infected cells. Several transcriptomics studies have demonstrated that different infectious agents (both viruses and bacteria) trigger specific pattern-recognition receptors expressed on host immune cells, activating different transcriptional factors that activate specific metabolic programs [20\u201330]. For instance, the cytokine profile induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection in infants is distinct from the profile induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [30]. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that volatile metabolic signatures could differentiate between virally-infected and uninfected cells. In addition to assessing the diagnostic utility of such an approach, the study of volatile metabolites produced during infection has the potential to generate insight into viral pathogenesis.",

These studies involved basic characterization of the headspace of infected cell culture versus uninfected cell culture, but did not evaluate the discrimination capability of the volatile metabolites produced during infection. The aim of this study is therefore to generate volatile fingerprints of cell cultures infected with virus (both RSV and IAV) and to evaluate their discrimination capability. Volatile metabolites were extracted from the headspace using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and then separated and identified by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC\u00d7GC) hyphenated with a ToF mass spectrometer (MS). The present study represents a novel application of this technique, which is particularly well-suited for the analysis of complex mixtures and is amongst the most powerful analytical tools available today for the analysis of volatile metabolites [36]. Using different machine learning algorithms, we were able to identify volatile metabolic patterns that could discriminate between cells infected with virus and those that were uninfected.",

Prior to statistical analyses, the relative abundance of compounds across chromatograms was normalized using Probabilistic Quotient Normalization [39]. Data was randomly subdivided into discovery (training) and validation (test) sets 100 times, with 2/3 of samples included in the discovery set, and the remaining 1/3 in the validation set. Three machine learning algorithms were used to identify the most highly discriminatory volatile metabolites and predict the class (i.e., cells infected with virus versus uninfected cells) to which samples in the validation set belonged, namely: random forest (RF) [40], support vector machines with a linear kernel (linear SVM) [41], and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) [42]. Mean decrease in accuracy, feature weights, and variable importance in projection were used as the measures of variable importance for RF, linear SVM, and PLS-DA, respectively [43]. For each of the 100 discovery/validation splits, volatile compounds were ranked according to their discriminatory ability, and different feature inclusion thresholds were compared (e.g., top 10%, 20% and 30%, etc) in terms of predictive ability. A compromise between the number of features included and model accuracy was obtained via the inclusion of the top 20% of features. The class probabilities were used to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and from these ROC curves, sensitivities, specificities, and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) were calculated. The optimal thresholds for class probabilities were calculated using Youden\u2019s J statistic [44], rather than the 0.5 cutoff that is traditionally applied to two-class classification problems. K-means clustering was used to identify groups of volatile metabolites that exhibited similar changes in relative concentration as a function of time, with the relative concentration defined as the difference in the chromatographic area (calculated based on the unique mass, A) between cells infected with virus and uninfected cells (Ainfected\u2013Auninfected). The elbow method was used to estimate the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering [45].",

In the first cluster, three volatile metabolites (#2, #3, #4, all molecules not identified) were included, whose relative abundance increased between 24 and 72 h, before a decrease by 122 h (figure 2(C)). The second cluster included three (#23: acetone, #31: molecule not identified, #44: alkylated hydrocarbon) that were detected at 49 h only, and not detected at the remaining time points. The third cluster included two (#35: not identified, #41: n-hexane) that increased between 24 and 49 h then decreased at 79 h only to increase again by 122 h. The relative concentrations of these latter features were negative across all time points, indicating that they were more highly abundant in uninfected controls. We therefore hypothesize that they were related to cell line aging rather than infection. Further studies are necessary to explain this behavior. The fourth cluster included the remaining 59 metabolites which demonstrated no clear trend as a function of time (supplementary figure S4).",

They have been reported to originate largely from free radical oxidative fragmentation of lipids due to oxidative stress [19, 59]. It has been shown that viral infection impairs the pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in favor of the former by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, in part through a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism [60]. In particular, it has been shown that the activity of superoxide dismutase enzymes increases during viral infection, especially at a mitochondrial level [60]. This increase in reactive oxygen species is directly correlated with the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons, which can explain the high abundance of hydrocarbons in our samples. However, these findings mainly refer to linear or iso-alkanes, while the origin of most of the alkylated hydrocarbons, which have been identified both in vitro and in vivo is still unclear [59]. An exogenous source for these compounds can also be hypothesized even if a presently undefined metabolic process cannot be excluded; further research has to be carried out to unveil this speculative idea.",

However, the differences at baseline were sufficiently great such that it was not possible to effectively make such a comparison. This may have resulted from numerous factors, including: (1) the use of different growth media across cell lines, (2) the comparison of a human (HEp-2) and murine (MLE-Kd) lineages, and (3) the comparison of transformed (HEp-2) versus non-transformed (MLE-Kd) lineages. RFE-RF resulted in the identification of 10 volatile metabolites that could differentiate between RSV-infected HEp-2 cells and IAV-infected MLE-Kd cells with approximately 74.9% accuracy, but which also differentiated between uninfected HEp-2 cells and uninfected MLE-Kd cells with 60.0% accuracy. Because of our inability to discriminate between uninfected HEp-2 and MLE-Kd cells, we elected to not report on those compounds that were most highly discriminatory between RSV- and IAV-infected cells, as differences in the production of these metabolites may have resulted from factors other than the type of virus used for infection.",
