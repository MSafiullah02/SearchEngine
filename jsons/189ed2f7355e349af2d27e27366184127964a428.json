The patient tested positive for COVID 12 year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and transient ischemic attack, 16 was admitted for traumatic syncope without any prodromes. He had a cardiac loop recorder 17 previously implanted to search for silent AF, which showed paroxysmal 3 rd degree AV block at the 18 time of the clinical event.

The day 21 after the patient had two presyncopal episodes while lying down, with profuse sweating, 22 lightheadedness and nausea, recognized by the patient as different from the symptom which led 23to PPM implantation. TTE and chest X-Ray were normal. Two days after, he developed a mild fever 24 (100.2 F).

After 20 days he was deemed recovered 9 from COVID-19 disease following 2 negative swabs 48 hours apart from each other and was 10 discharged home(Figure 2, panel B). Five days after, he presented again to the ED because of a 11 syncope preceded by dizziness. His ICD was interrogated and showed normal functioning, regular 12 parameters and no arrhythmias.
