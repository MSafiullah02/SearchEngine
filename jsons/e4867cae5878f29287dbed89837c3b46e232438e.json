Upper respiratory tract infections including nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and otitis media constitute 87.5% of the total episodes of respiratory infections. The vast majority of acute upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses. Common cold is caused by viruses in most circumstances and does not require antimicrobial agent unless it is complicated by acute otitis media with effusion, tonsillitis, sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infection. Sinusitis is commonly associated with common cold. Most instances of rhinosinusitis are viral and therefore, resolve spontaneously without antimicrobiat therapy. The most common bacterial agents causing sinusitis are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus and S. pyogenes. Amoxycillin is antibacterial of choice. The alternative drugs are cefaclor or cephalexin. The latter becomes first line if sinusitis is recurrent or chronic. Acute pharyngitis is commonly caused by viruses and does not need antibiotics. About 15% of the episodes may be due to Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABS). Early initiation of antibiotics in pharyngitis due to GABS can prevent complications such as acute rheumatic fever. The drug of choice is penicillin for 10-14 days. The alternative medications include oral cephalosporins (cefaclor, cephalexin), amoxicillin or macrolides.",

Upper respiratory tract infections including nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and otitis media constituted 87.5% of the total episodes of infection. Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia and bronchiolitis constituted the remaining 12.5%. 2 In a survey of acute respiratory infection in a rural area of South India, the prevalence of acute respiratory infection was 7.6 % in a total of 10,951 children below 5 years. Majority of acute respiratory infection was mild (defined by cough + respiratory rate <50) only 1.7% episodes were severe in nature (cough + respiratory rate >50 + chest indrawing/inability to drink). 3 Thus, acute respiratory infection constitutes a significant problem in childhood and the majority of these infections are upper respiratory infection. Bacterial This bring forth the fact that, majority of respiratory infections on children are due to a viral etiology which do not need antibiotics for management and judicious use of antibiotics is most imperative in upper respiratory tract infections.",
