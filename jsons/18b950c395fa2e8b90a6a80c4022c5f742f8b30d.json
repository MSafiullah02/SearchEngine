Surfactant proteins (SPs) constitute a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components of the surfactant, which contribute to surface tension lowering through specifi c interactions with DPPC and involvement in surfactant turnover process. Because of its well-known tensioactive properties, exogenous surfactant administration in RDS results in reduction of alveolar opening pressure, increase of lung volume at a certain distending pressure, and stabilization of lung volume during the defl ation phases, thus reducing the work of breathing [ 8 , 9 ] .",

Therefore, the positive effects of surfactant administration in preterm neonates may be related not only to direct improvement of lung mechanics but also to local antioxidant activity of surfactant and to increased antioxidant potential of alveolar cells. Interestingly, the comparison between natural lung surfactant and a lung surfactant extract containing only 1 % of proteins showed that the latter contains no signifi cant amount of antioxidant enzymes and does not exert any scavenging activity against H 2 O 2 [ 11 ] . These data reinforce the concept that surfactant mixtures not containing proper amount of protein compounds, as synthetic surfactants, are inadequate for clinical purpose at present, probably not only because of suboptimal tensoactive properties but also for the lack of enzymes naturally present in lung surfactant.",

Comparing these mixtures, Beractant roughly showed the highest content of SOD per mg of phosholipids, while Calfactant showed the highest content of CAT, but when enzymatic activities were expressed per mL of surfactant, Poractant provided the highest content of SOD while Calfactant was confi rmed to contain the highest amount of CAT. Moreover, considering the recommended doses for clinical use, Poractant was shown to provide the major amount of SOD, while Calfactant was proved to contain the major amount of CAT ( However, not only SOD and CAT but also different antioxidant enzymes, as glutathione peroxidase and reductase, may be involved in determining the net antioxidant effect of surfactant, but unfortunately their activity in natural surfactants have not been detailed yet.",

Plasmalogens were recently considered of great importance to the proper biophysical function of the surfactant. According to the \"surface-associated reservoir\" model, large areas of surfactant layer are folded during the expiration phase, but remain adherent to the monolayer present at the air-liquid interface and extend during inspiration. Plasmalogens, together with cholesterol, were proved to work synergistically with the hydrophobic SP-B and SP-C for the proper formation of the reservoir and the spreading of DPPC and, in the experimental model, plasmalogens addition to surfactant achieved further reduction of surface tension and viscosity in comparison to surfactant alone [ 8 , 25 , 29 ] . Besides surface-active properties, plasmalogens were recently demonstrated to confer consistent antioxidant protection against ultraviolet light-induced lipid peroxidation within cell membranes [ 30 ] and also to exert antioxidant functions in low density lipoproteins [ 31 ] . The content of plasmalogens has been detailed for Poractant, Beractant, and Bovactant, but not for Calfactant [ 8 , 25 ] , and resulted consistently higher for Poractant than Beractant and Bovactant (Table 12 .1 ). These results could partially explain the different scavenger performances against H 2 O 2 observed for the natural surfactants, together with the differences in the content of antioxidant enzymes [ 12 ] . Moreover, along with plasmalogens, PUFAs are considered one of the main substrates for lipid peroxidation in lung surfactant and they were also recently demonstrated to exert consistent scavenger activity against ROS in cellular models [ 32 ] . Peroxidation of PUPLs induced by ROS at the air-liquid interface would then initiate a chain reaction, increasing in turn the availability of ROS in the alveolar spaces [ 25 ] . Interestingly, Poractant presents the highest concentration of PUPLs among natural surfactants [ 25 ] , and, because of the highest concentration in the recommended dose, Poractant putatively has also the highest scavenger activity due to PULPs per treatment dose [ 12 ] .",
