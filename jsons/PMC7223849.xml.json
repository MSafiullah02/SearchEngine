B. cereus concentration in Holder pasteurized donor milk was 3-fold higher than raw donor milk (unpasteurized), whereas shelf-stable donor milk (retort sterilization) had no colonies of B. cereus [11]. B. cereus spores in human milk resist pasteurization and their spores can change in vegetative cells and grow during the cooling and thawing steps to become active in pasteurized donor milk [12].

No selective agar culture media has been used to enumerate Bacillus cereus in raw or pasteurized human milk. Mannitol-egg yolk-phenol red-agar (MYP), a selective agar culture media, has been developed to enumerate vegetative cells and spores of B. cereus in foods containing other bacteria or microorganisms [13]. No study has used MYP agar to detect the presence of B. cereus in raw or pasteurized human milk or in fluid samples (bloods and stools) from infected infants.

B. cereus caused severe infections in preterm infants, including bacteremia, pneumonia and meningoencephalitis [6, 19, 20]. In all types of B. cereus disease, the virulence was associated with enterotoxin (cereulide) production: diarrheal syndrome (abdominal pain and diarrhea) is caused when vegetative cells of B. cereus produce cereulide in the small intestine, whereas emetic syndrome (nausea and vomiting) is caused by ingested food containing emetic B. cereus and/or preformed emetic cereulide [21]. The mode of transmission for B. cereus infection in preterm infants was reported to be from various sources (including ventilator equipment, staff hands and catheters), but many report cases did not find the origin of B. cereus contamination [6]. B. cereus strains were also isolated from gastric fluid in two preterm infants fed pasteurized donor milk and both samples (fluid and milk) had high virulence potency B. cereus [5]. These investigators suggested that pasteurized donor milk could be a reservoir for pathogenic B. cereus due to its higher growth in pasteurized milk [5]. Pasteurized donor human was also suspected to be the source for three cases of B. cereus infection in preterm infants [22]. Lewin et al. [23] reported that the association between B. cereus contaminated pasteurized donor milk and preterm infection has never been documented. The number of reported cases of B. cereus infections in infants, many of which were fatal, are likely to be underestimated due to the lack of microbiological methods that can be used to identify B. cereus in hospitals. Most Milk Banks do not have sufficient bacteriologic methods for the identification of B. cereus in human milk. The origin of B. cereus in raw or pasteurized human milk is still unclear.",

No previous study has examined the effect of vaccination during pregnancy on the microbial concentration in human milk. A possible explanation of the lower concentration of B. cereus and CNS in human milk from vaccinated mothers during pregnancy could be due to the higher level of human milk immune components (antibodies and immune cells) with antibacterial activity compared with that from non-vaccinated mothers. S. aureus did not differ between vaccinated mothers and non-vaccinated mothers, which could be related to lower milk immune components specific to S. aureus. Vaccination during pregnancy increases the secretion of pertussis-specific [24] and influenza-specific [25] antibodies in human milk, which may also provide passive protection against these pathogens. Therefore, flu and pertussis vaccines could increase the secretion of antibodies in human milk that are non-specific and prevent the growth of CNS and B. cereus, but no evidence has yet been provided. B. cereus, S. aureus and CNS concentrations in milk did not differ between preterm-delivering mothers and term-delivering mothers. This result is in accordance with Landers et al. [10] that found bacteria profiles of milk expressed from preterm-delivering mothers in the first month postpartum did not differ from that expressed by mothers delivering at full term. Vaccination during pregnancy is mandatory in some countries (France), whereas it is recommended (but not obligatory) by the FDA in USA. More studies are needed to evaluate the efficiency of vaccination on the prevention of pathogens in human milk.",

This results is in agreement with two previous studies that found 5% [10] and 5.8% [9] of pasteurized donor milk samples with Bacillus species. However, these investigators did not perform a specific enumeration for Bacillus species or B. cereus and relied on the total aerobic counts using PCA [10]. Total aerobic counts in pasteurized human milk are mostly from Bacillus species because their spores survive pasteurization whereas other microorganisms are destroyed [26]. MYP agar is a selective and differential medium for the enumeration of spores and vegetative cells of B. cereus in the presence of high concentration of other bacteria in food due to its resistance to polymyxin, lack of mannitol fermentation (which produces pink red colonies) and presence of lecithinase (induce a zone of precipitate around the colonies) [13]. The presence of B. cereus spores was confirmed by ELISA on 64.5% of milk samples that were positive for B. cereus on MYP agar. ELISA was previously used for its high sensitivity detection of B. cereus spores in meat [27], but no previous study has used ELISA to detect B. cereus spores in human milk. Antibodies specific to B. cereus spore antigen can detect both dead and viable cells and spores, which may explain the higher number of milk samples that were positive for B. cereus spores (26.7%). Therefore, MYP agar was more appropriate to detect B. cereus in raw human milk samples than ELISA due to its capacity to enumerate only viable active cells and spores from B. cereus.",

The faster growth of B. cereus in pasteurized donor milk samples could be partially due to the destruction of other microorganisms, which reduces the competition for nutrients. Lactoferrin and secretory IgA concentrations are reduced (66 and 26%, respectively) after pasteurization of raw donor milk [28]. The lower concentration of these antimicrobial immune components in pasteurized donor milk is another factor that allows for faster growth of pathogenic bacteria [29]. Growth inhibition of S. aureus, E. coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly lower in the pasteurized human milk compared with that in raw human milk [30]. Therefore, identification of Bacillus cereus before and after pasteurization is required to reduce the risk of B. cereus infection in preterm infants fed pasteurized human milk.",

This result could be due to the interactions between B. cereus and staphylococci that stimulate B. cereus growth in human milk. Staphylococci could produce nutrients for B. cereus and/or inactive antimicrobial peptides/proteins by proteolysis. A previous study demonstrated that B. cereus stimulated enterotoxin production by S. aureus when grown at 25 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C in ham slurry [31], but no study has investigated the stimulation of B. cereus growth by staphylococci. The origin of Staphylococcus species in human milk is usually from the mother\u2019s skin and nipples [10], whereas B. cereus could come from water, dust or air [32]. S. aureus is the most often microorganism associated with the cause of mastitis in breastfeeding women [33]. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus in raw milk from mothers with mastitis was likely implicated in the mortality of preterm infants with sepsis [34]. Septicemia and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants was possibly related to raw human milk contaminated with CNS (identified S. epidermidis) [4]. S. epidermidis and S. aureus were also identified in blood from preterm infants fed pasteurized human milk [35]. Therefore, human milk containing high concentration of S. aureus or CNS ( > 104 CFU/mL) should be discarded (before pasteurization) to reduce the risk of infection in fragile and ill infants.",

In the present study, SEA, SEB and SED were not detected in raw human milk, including those with high concentrations of S. aureus ( > 105 CFU/mL). This observation is in accordance with Almutawif et al. [39] that showed no production of SEA and SEB by S. aureus 2482 in raw human milk incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 10 days and 21 \u00b0C for 18 h. However, these investigators demonstrated that S. aureus produced SEA and SEB (limit of detection was 0.5 ng/mL) in pasteurized donor milk incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 9 h but no SEs were produced in raw human milk, suggesting that raw human milk can suppress production of SEs by S. aureus compared to pasteurized donor milk [39]. SEs were synthesized by S. aureus throughout the late logarithmic phase of growth or during the transition from the exponential to the stationary phase (108\u2013109 CFU/mL) [39, 40]. SEA (1 ng/mL) was also detected in pasteurized cow\u2019s milk with S. aureus at 104 CFU/mL incubated at 35 \u00b0C for 15 h [41]. In this study, S. aureus concentrations were below 107 CFU/mL in all human milk samples, which could explain the absence of SEs. To verify this hypothesis, five raw human milk samples with high concentration of S. aureus were incubated at 35 \u00b0C for 48 h and 72 h to reach exponential growth and no SEs were detected (data not shown). Therefore, the absence of SEs could be due to the absence of S. aureus strain able to produce SEs or the inhibition of SE production by the milk microbiome or immune components with antimicrobial properties. Therefore, the risk of SEs in raw human milk is likely to be minimal, but their detection in pasteurized donor milk products is highly recommended to eliminate the small risk of heat-stable SEs remaining active after pasteurization.",

Future studies are needed to identify the prevalence of B. cereus cereulide in pasteurized human milk and the factors that induce B. cereus gastroenteritis in preterm infants. Another limitation was that we did not differentiate methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive for S. aureus. Moreover, we did not have the exact date of vaccination during pregnancy for Tdap vaccine and/or flu vaccine, but only the approximately time (between second and third trimester).",

Preterm infants fed raw human milk or pasteurized donor milk were associated with lower risk of NEC compared with those fed preterm formula, when given until 34 weeks of postpartum age [44]. Pasteurization of raw human milk also reduces the risk of postnatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection by its inactivation. Preterm infants fed raw human milk were associated with higher rate of postnatally acquired CMV infections compared with those fed pasteurized human milk [45]. However, these investigators also reported that preterm infants fed unpasteurized human milk had lower rate of NEC compared with those fed pasteurized human milk. Ultraviolet-C irradiation could be used to deactivate CMV in human milk [46]. Ultraviolet-C irradiation of human milk can preserve higher active immune proteins than Holder pasteurization, resulting in bacteriostatic properties similar to raw human milk [47]. Overall, raw and pasteurized human milk must be carefully analyzed for potential pathogens when used for feeding preterm infants.",

The presence of B. cereus in raw human milk was associated with higher concentration of CNS and S. aureus compared with human milk without B. cereus. Microbial sampling on raw human milk samples before pooling and pasteurizing steps is highly recommended to discard those containing B. cereus or milk with too high level of staphylococci. The detection of B. cereus in human milk must be performed with specific and sensitive microbiological methods to reduce the risk of underestimating the presence of this pathogen that resists pasteurization. Improvement of the sensitivity of bacteriologic exams on human milk could be used to isolate the milk containing pathogenic and/or non-pathogenic species that can be harmful for immunosuppressed premature infants. Raw human milk is the gold standard for feeding term infants, but due to the immature immune system, preterm infants may need sterilized human milk supplemented with immune components to prevent microbial infection in NICU. Future studies are required to investigate cases of infections in preterm infants fed raw or pasteurized human milk to better understand the potential association with B. cereus. Further works are needed to determine whether the type and the time of vaccination during pregnancy influence the reduction of B. cereus and other pathogens in human milk.",
