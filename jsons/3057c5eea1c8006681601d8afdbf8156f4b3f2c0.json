The authors reported the X-ray structure of unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M pro and its complex with \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor after a modification from the previously designed inhibitor through incorporating P3-P2 amide bond into pyridone ring so as to increase its half-life in plasma. Finally the authors demonstrated that the crystal structure of M pro provides a basis for designing of a potent inhibitor to the protease with a marked tropism to the lung and with ease of administration through inhalation.",

The world health organization (WHO) named the disease \"COVID-19\" and declared it as a world health emergency pandemic. Studying the crystal structure of targets for treatment is very crucial to know the mechanism of action of prospective drugs. A structural study on the coronavirus main protease 3CL pro inhibitor complex established designing of broad-spectrum halomethyl ketone inhibitors to the Coronaviridae family and demonstrated that these inhibitors form a thioether linkage with high affinity to the target 3 . Hilgenfeld's group reported earlier that a structurebased design of peptidomimetic \u03b1-ketoamides are also effective broad-spectrum inhibitors to the main and 3C protease of coronaviruses and enteroviruses as demonstrated by crystal structure of inhibitor-protease complex 4 . The 3CL protease of coronaviruses facilitates viral assembly by cleaving polyproteins and most active compounds prevent disease progression by inhibiting viral proteases 5 .",

In order to confirm this, the authors solved the crystal structure of M pro of SARS-CoV-2 at 1.75 \u00c5 resolution and found that the crystal structure is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV M pro only with a 0.53 \u00c5 r.m.s difference between the two free enzymes. SARS-CoV-2 M pro forms a tight dimer and has a contact interface mainly between domain II of molecule A and the NH 2terminal residues of molecule B where this dimerization is important for catalytic activity. Unlike SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV M pro dimer has a polar interaction between the two domains III involving a 2.60 \u00c5 hydrogen bond between the side chain hydroxyl groups of Thr 285 of each protomer which is also supported by a hydrophobic interaction between the side chain of Ile 286 and Thr 285 . In SARS-CoV-2 M pro , threonine is replaced with alanine and isoleucine with leucine. As suggested by authors, Alanine replacements change the enzyme dynamics and increase its catalytic activity by allowing the two domains III to be in a close contact; although, the catalytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro was only slightly higher with similar K d of dimer dissociation (~2.5 \u03bcM).",

To view a copy of this license, visit http://creativecommons. After entering into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 releases its genomic RNA. The process of translation yields polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved to the main protease M pro and nonstructural proteins (nsps). M pro is involved in the producing of nsps. Nsps is essential for assembling the viral replication transcription complex (RTC) to engage in RNA synthesis. Once inhibitors, such as 11r, 13a, and 13b, act in the cell, they bind to M pro and inhibit the activity of this enzyme, resulting in failure of virion assembly. Ultimately, host cell fails to release the new intact virions. Colored box highlight the modifications from 11r to 14b. Due to lacking Boc group, 14b could not cross the cellular membrane to inhibit viral replication",
