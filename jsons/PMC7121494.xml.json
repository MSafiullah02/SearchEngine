After Dr. Christian Barnard\u2019s first orthotopic heart transplant in December 1967, and Dr. Shumway first heart transplant in the United States in January 1968, heart transplantation became a standard therapeutic option for life-threatening congestive failure and started to be performed in the hundreds over the next following years at different centers. Heart transplant surgery faced complications due in part to rejection and infection. However, the development of more selective immunosuppressive therapy and improvements in prevention, detection, and treatment of infections allowed for heart transplant surgery to increase rapidly worldwide.",

Shortly after, thoracic surgeons optimized the single- and double-lung transplant procedures. Improvement of surgical techniques, especially bronchial anastomosis and evolution of flush perfusion lung preservation, decreased the perioperative bronchial complications substantially. Similarly to heart transplantation, improvements in immunosuppressive regimens, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and graft preservation led to enhancement in survival among lung transplant recipients. In contrast to cardiac, lung transplantation has faced the challenge of infections unique to the transplant of this organ. Mold infections of the anastomotic site, host versus graft disease, and serious infections with Mycobacterium abscessus, Chlamydia spp., bronchiolitis, and Burkholderia cepacia complex are among infectious complications rarely observed in other transplant patients [7].",

            "text": "A total of 4096 heart transplants were performed in 2011. Heart transplant recipients have an average age of 54 years and are predominantly man (76%). They have a significant history of smoking (46%) and hypertension (45%) and have cardiomyopathy (54%) followed by coronary artery disease (37%) as the leading causes of transplant [1]. The historical (pediatric and adult transplants between 1982 and 2011) 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates are 81%, 69%, and 50%, respectively. Overall median survival is 11 years, but it increases up to 13 years for those surviving the first year after transplantation. Although not associated with increased posttransplant mortality, infections before transplant can affect up to 25% of heart transplant candidates. Being bronchitis and soft tissue infections, the more commonly present [9]. Despite no major changes in the distribution of causes of death since 1994, infections remained a predominant factor of mortality during the first 3 years after transplant. It contributes with up to almost 20% of causes of death [3]. The global incidence of infections in heart transplant ranges between 30% and 60% and the associated mortality between 4% and 15% [10]. The incidence of infection measured as major infectious episodes per patient has steadily declined from 2.83 in the early 1970s to 0.81 in the early 2000s [3, 8, 11]. The most frequent type of infection is bacterial (44%), followed by viral (42%), fungal including Pneumocystis jirovecii (14%), and protozoa (0.6%). Unfavorable functional outcomes are observed in patients who developed infections in the first year of transplant, mainly associated with bloodstream, CMV, and lung infections [12]. Pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) infections are independent predictors of mortality among heart transplant recipients. Reactivation of latent parasitic infections residing in extra-cardiac tissues in the host or transmitted in the transplanted heart is an important consideration. The classic example is the reactivation of Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is a vector-borne illness transmitted by triatomine bugs, and it is endemic in Latin America. The ethnicity or origin of either the donor or the recipient from these regions should raise the concern for possible reactivation. Chagas reactivation was documented in 38.8% of cases in a cohort of Brazilian heart transplant recipients, where Chagas cardiomyopathy was the second most common indication for transplant (34.9%) [13]. Chagas can also reactivate from the transplanted heart procured from a seropositive donor and transplanted into a seronegative recipient. Although with a substantial decreased on its prevalence in the most recent eras, toxoplasmosis is another important consideration in this setting. Similarly to Chagas, Toxoplasma gondii\u2014also with a predilection to invade the myocardium\u2014can be transmitted by reactivation of quiescent cysts in the recipient or the transplanted heart [14].",

            "text": "By 2011, 3640 adults received lung transplantation, the highest reported number of procedures up to that date, driven mainly by the increase of double-lung transplants. Double-lung transplant is indicated for septic lung diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis). Around 66% of recipients were aged 45\u201365 years old. The most frequent indications for transplant were COPD (34%), followed by interstitial lung disease (ILD) (24%), bronchiectasis associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) (17%), and \u03b11AT deficiency-related COPD (6%) [15]. The overall (from 1994 to 2011) 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates among lung recipients are 79%, 53%, and 31%, respectively. Overall median survival is 5.6 years. Lung transplants from CMV seronegative donors have better survival rates than from CMV seropositive donor. Thirty-day mortality was led by graft failure (24.7%) and non-CMV infections (19.6%). During the remainder of the year, non-CMV infections were the leading cause of death (35.6%). Infection is still prominent as the cause of death following the first year of transplant after bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)/chronic lung rejection or graft failure [15]. Other infections complications historically present among the ten primary causes of death within the first year include sepsis, pneumonia, and fungal infections [16]. High lung allocation score (LAS) at the time of transplantation is associated with a lower 1-year survival and higher rates of infections among lung transplant recipients [17].",

Mechanical ventilation (MV) for >5 days immediately following transplant surgery and isolation of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) from airway cultures in the recipient were considered risk factors for invasive SA infections in a retrospective study of patients with lung and heart-lung transplants [20]. Likewise, risk factors for the development of healthcare-associated infections with Gram-negative organisms, Aspergillus, Legionella, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), include prolonging MV, renal failure, use of ATG (antithymocyte globulin), and recurrent rejections episodes [21]. Additionally, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin deficiency and repeat transplantation are also risk factors for nosocomial infections.

Furthermore, we recommend to obtain serologies for CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, and Toxoplasma gondii, and for HTLV-1/HTLV-2 in endemic areas. In high-risk donors, the use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for HBV, HCV, and HIV should be considered. Additionally, blood cultures to document an occult bacteremia are recommended. In lung transplant donors, we recommend obtaining respiratory cultures through bronchoscopy to detect colonizing organisms and target them to prevent invasive infections in the donor. Culturing the media of the allograft during acquisition or processing have been advocated to reduce the risk of mycotic aneurysms among kidney transplant recipients, which may apply to other SOT [35].

Use of oral CMX001 (oral liposomal formulation of cidofovir) in hematopoietic-cell transplants reduced CMV-related events and may have a potential role in preventing CMV in other transplant settings [49].

Pertinent-independent risk factors associated with the development of this infection in SOT include high-dose steroids, history of CMV disease, and high levels of calcineurin inhibitors [62]. With the almost universal prophylaxis with TMP-SMX, Nocardia infection is less common and often present late, usually after 1 year posttransplant [63]. When they occurred, they affect the lung predominantly, which is the port of entry for disseminated infections and CNS invasion. Also, it can cause skin nodules and abscesses. Listeria monocytogenes can also be seen in heart transplant recipients and can count for a significant proportion of the bacterial meningitis cases in this setting [64]. Additionally, myocarditis and myocardial abscesses with this organism have also been documented [65]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), although, documented to occur in heart transplantation, are rare in the United States [66, 67]. However, it is important to recognize that the development of tuberculosis (TB) can be more prevalent in some endemic regions and often present with extrapulmonary involvement [68, 69]. Legionellosis and Rhodococcus equi with mainly pulmonary manifestations (pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates, or cavitation) are another significant infections among heart transplant recipients [70].",

            "text": "Fungal infections excluding PCP represent around 4.0% of all the infections. From them, invasive mold infections (IMI) are a significant contribution to morbidity and mortality among heart transplant recipients. The incidence in this population can reach 10 per 1000 person-years, and its associated mortality is approximately 17% [71]. Aspergillus represents up to 65% of all IMI. Its median time of onset is about 46 days, although late presentation (>90 days) has been more recently recognized associated with receipt of sirolimus in conjunction with tacrolimus for refractory rejection or cardiac allograft vasculopathy [72]. The most common clinical presentation for aspergillosis includes fever, cough, and single or multiple pulmonary nodules [73]. Extrapulmonary manifestations include spondylodiscitis, infective endocarditis, mediastinitis, endophthalmitis, and brain and cutaneous abscesses [74\u201378]. Dissemination tends to affect the CNS in a good proportion of the cases. Mucormycosis is the second most frequent mold affecting heart transplant recipients. Mucor, along with other non-Aspergillus molds (e.g., Scedosporium, Ochroconis gallopava), are associated with disseminated infections, CNS involvement, and poorer outcomes [79, 80]. Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP)\u2014although with a marked reduction in incidence with the introduction of universal prophylaxis\u2014is still a significant pathogen and cases may occur late after heart transplant. Cryptococcosis, although infrequent among SOT patients, has its higher incidence in heart transplant recipients [81]. Usually, its manifestations present late and affect the lungs and the CNS predominantly. Histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis occurred typically in the first year after transplant. Antigenuria was the most sensitive diagnostic test in SOT for histoplasmosis [82]. Finally, Candida infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality as well. Rate of colonization is higher than in the general population [83]. Candida most commonly causes an oral mucosa infection. Although there has been a decline of invasive infections over time, these do occur and typically in the form of bloodstream infections secondary to catheter-related infections, tracheobronchitis, or disseminated disease [84]. Additionally, other confined end-organ injuries such as endophthalmitis and esophagitis can also be seen.",

            "text": "CMV infection is of critical importance among SOT. In heart transplant recipients, CMV has been inconsistently associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy [85]. Furthermore, CMV leads to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increase procoagulant response, left ventricular dysfunction, allograft rejection, and an increase of opportunistic infections [86]. The greatest risk for developing CMV disease is CMV-negative recipients of CMV-positive organs (D+/R\u2212), followed by D+/R+ and D\u2212/R+. A clinical report estimated that the rate of infections in heart transplant ranges between 9% and 35%, and disease is present in around 25% of patients [87]. The clinical manifestations are not unique to heart transplant recipients and include a CMV syndrome (fevers, myalgias, arthralgias, malaise, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). CMV-associated end-organ injury in this setting includes most frequently pneumonitis and gastrointestinal disease [10]. Other manifestations comprise myelosuppression, hepatitis, and pancreatitis. In contrast to the high frequency observed in AIDS patients, chorioretinitis in heart transplant patients is relatively rare [87]. Guidelines on CMV diagnosis and managements are discussed in more detail in Chap. 55 and also have been published elsewhere [88]. Other herpes viruses are of important consideration as well. EBV-associated T-cell PTLDs are more frequent in heart transplant recipients (0.4%) than in other SOT patients [89]. PTLD is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the pediatric heart transplant population [90]. Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV1), human herpes virus (HHV)-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8 might play a role in EBV(\u2212) T-cell PTLDs as well. Herpes viruses can manifest, as in other hosts, as mucocutaneous lesions for HSV, herpes zoster for VZV, infectious mononucleosis in the case of EBV, Kaposi sarcoma for HHV-8, and encephalitis for HHV-6/7. Hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, and gastrointestinal disease have also been attributed to dissemination with certain herpes viruses. Herpes viruses can present with disseminated skin lesions (with or without vesicle formation) and fever of unknown origin.",

Other associated risk factors include negative serum status before transplant, diagnosis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and high-dose prednisone. Toxoplasmosis can be transmitted by the donor heart (D+/R\u2212, especially during the first 3 months) or can reactivate from the recipient (>3 months). Most of the infections developed during the first 6 months posttransplant and are predominantly primary infections. About 22% of infected patients had a disseminated infection carrying an estimated 17% mortality. Toxoplasmosis can manifest otherwise with myocarditis, encephalitis, pneumonitis, or chorioretinitis. Diagnosis requires identification of tissue cysts surrounded by an abnormal inflammatory response, detection of Toxoplasma DNA in body fluids by PCR, or positive Toxoplasma-specific immunohistochemistry in affected organs. Posttransplant serological tests are not helpful for diagnosis and may be misleading since results may change or not regardless of the presence of toxoplasmosis [95].

            "text": "Advanced Chagasic cardiomyopathy is a primary indication for heart transplantation in some centers [13]. Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal organism of Chagas disease, can be transmitted up to 75% of the time from infected heart donors (D+/R\u2212) [97]. Additionally, Chagas disease can reactivate from the donor once immunosuppression is in place (R+). The reactivation rate can range between 22% and 90% in recipients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy undergoing heart transplant [98\u2013100]. Additional risk factors for reactivation include rejection episodes, neoplasms, and use of MMF [98]. The mean onset of symptoms is approximately 112 days [101]. Once manifested, Chagas can present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, malaise, anorexia, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Myocarditis, pericarditis, and encephalitis are also seen. Reactivation can mimic rejection and exhibits congestive heart failure, AV block and skin manifestations such as nodules and panniculitis. Increased eosinophil count and anemia can be indirect indicators of reactivation [102]. Diagnosis is made with the visualization of circulating trypomastigotes in peripheral blood. Additionally, blood and tissue PCR can be used. Tissue amastigotes can be seen in biopsy H&E preparations (Fig. 2.1). Finally, serologies are a crucial aspect in the diagnosis especially if seroconversion have been documented. In asymptomatic individuals, when the diagnosis of Chagas has been established in the donor, monitoring should be instituted with weekly blood T. cruzi PCR and microscopy [29]. Preferred antitrypanosomal therapy consists on benznidazole. Nifurtimox is an alternative treatment option. Posaconazole has anti-parasitic activity but carries high failure rates [103, 104]. GI disease with Isospora (Cystoisospora) belli, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, and Microsporidia has been reported to affect SOT recipients. Microsporidiosis can manifest with disseminated disease: fever, keratoconjunctivitis, CNS involvement, cholangitis, cough, and thoracic/abdominal pain [94]. Other rare parasitic infections affecting heart transplants include leishmaniasis, strongyloidiasis, and free-living amoebas [94, 105].\n",

Heart transplantation itself is an independent risk factor for SSIs. Other risk factors include age, prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin alone, positive wire cultures, female gender, previous left ventricular assist device (VAD) placement, BMI >30 kg/m2, previous cardiac procedures, and inotropic support for hemodynamic instability [41, 106]. Similarly to other hosts, Staphylococcus species are the predominant organism causing SSTIs. MRSA can reach up to 21% of the cases. Gram-positive organisms: VRE (E. faecalis), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and other Enterococcus species are other etiologic agents. Candida and selected gram negatives such as Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia can cause SSIs as well [107]. Sternal osteomyelitis often complicates deep SSI. Additionally, sternal wound infections by NTM and fungi such as Aspergillus and Scedosporium have been documented [108, 109]. Herpes zoster is also an important consideration and source of morbidity. Herpes zoster (HZ) is found as a complication in 19\u201322% of the patients with a median time of presentation ranging from 0.73 to 2.10 years [64, 110]. Close to half may develop postherpetic neuralgia. Multi-dermatome involvement, zoster ophthalmicus, and meningoencephalitis are also described. Exposure to MMF is an independent risk factor. Conversely, CMV prophylaxis reduces the risk for HZ.",

The median onset is about 51\u2013191 days, and the sources are in order of frequency: lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and CRBSI. Gram-negative bacteria were more commonly isolated. They are in order of appearance E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. More common Gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and L. monocytogenes. Directly attributable mortality is 12.2%. Among the identifiable independent risk factors to develop BSI are hemodialysis, prolonged intensive care unit stay, and viral infections [112, 113]. Infective endocarditis (IE)\nis seen more frequently among heart transplant recipients than in the general population. With IE occurred, it most commonly involves the mitral and tricuspid valves and Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus are the main etiologic organisms. The main predisposing factors in this setting are believed to be the frequent use of vascular indwelling catheters and the frequency of endomyocardial biopsies [114]. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in heart transplant recipients ranges from 10% to 38% [11, 115]. The sources of SA bacteremia in SOT are CRBSI (30%), pneumonia (24%), wound (14%), endocarditis (10%), intra-abdominal infections (9%), bone and joint (7%), cardiac devices (3%), UTI (1%), and SSTI (1%) [115].",

Pneumonia is one the major contributors to mortality in the early postoperative period. Pneumonia-related mortality approaches 15% [116]. After the 1st month, interstitial pneumonia and pneumonitis can develop, and the differential includes herpesviruses (HSV, CMV, VZV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Toxoplasma gondii and Pneumocystis jiroveci. Pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation can be caused by fungi such as coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, cryptococcosis; bacterial including actinomycosis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, Nocardia, Rhodococcus equi, and Gram-negative bacilli; and noninfectious causes like pulmonary infarction or lymphoproliferative disorders [117, 118]. Pulmonary nodules are seen in about 10% of the patients, and the median detection time is about 66 days. The associated symptoms are fever and cough. The most frequent etiology is Aspergillus followed by Nocardia, and Rhodococcus. CMV is an exceedingly rare cause of pulmonary nodules. The diagnostic approach with the higher yield is transthoracic fine needle aspiration followed by bronchoalveolar lavage and transtracheal aspiration [118]. Community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, Legionella spp., mycoplasma, and influenza is another source of morbidity [10].",

However, Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia species, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, NTM, Pandorea, and Ralstonia are also observed [23]. Furthermore, pathogens that are known to cause nosocomial pneumonia during the 1st month include Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Gram negatives (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter species), and anaerobes.",

The most common sites affected were the respiratory tract, followed by bacteremia, skin, wound, and catheter related. The pathogens more frequently identified are Staphylococcus species (77%), Enterococcus species (12%), Streptococcus species (6%), Pneumococcus (4%), and Eubacterium lentum (1%). Staphylococcus aureus infection can develop up to 20% of lung recipients. SA commonly causes pneumonia, followed by tracheobronchitis, bacteremia, intrathoracic infections, and SSTIs [20]. Streptococcus pneumoniae is community acquired and present with pneumonia, usually after 6 months posttransplant. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has high rates of colonization (up to 40%) and disease (30%) [134]. Other significant bacterial infections that may present after the 1st month are Mycobacterium tuberculosis, NTM, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Legionella. Isolation of NTM in lung transplant recipients without evidence of disease is not associated with increased mortality [135]. Nocardiosis can occur in about 2% of the lung transplant recipients. The median time of onset ranges from 14.3 to 34.1 months [136, 137]. Nocardia asteroides, N. farcinica, N. nova, and N. brasiliensis have been reported. N. farcinica appears to carry worse outcomes. This infection\ncan present as a breakthrough in the presence of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for P. jiroveci prophylaxis, although the isolates may remain susceptible. Mortality has been reported to range between 18% and 40%. The native lung is more frequently affected in single-lung transplant recipients. Nodules are the more prevalent radiographic finding. Extrapulmonary involvement\naffecting the skin and brain can be seen. Hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia seem to confer additional risk factors for nocardiosis in this setting [137].",

Aspergillus and Candida are the most frequent causative agents. Other important fungi include Cryptococcus spp., mucormycosis, endemic fungi (Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces spp.), Scedosporium spp., Fusarium spp., and dematiaceous molds. Candida infections are prominent during the 1st month after transplantation. It can be one of the most common causes of BSI in this setting [139]. Although colonization of the upper airways and gastrointestinal tract is common, Candida additionally\ncan cause mucocutaneous disease, tracheobronchitis, anastomosis site infections, CRBSI, and disseminated disease. Aspergillus spp. lead as the cause of invasive fungal infections. Its attack rate of infection is almost ten times compared to that in other SOT patients (estimated incidence of 6% among lung transplant recipients) [140, 141]. A. fumigatus\nis the most common species, but A. terreus, A. flavus, and A. niger have been described as well. The main predisposing risk factors in this setting are intense immunosuppression, previous colonization with Aspergillus spp., airway ischemia, and BOS. Single-lung transplant possesses the greatest risk to developing an invasive Aspergillus infection carrying a higher mortality than double-lung and heart-lung transplant recipients. Single-lung recipients are usually older and more likely to have COPD as the indication for transplantation [140]. Aspergillus infections can present as tracheobronchitis, pneumonia, or disseminated disease. Extrapulmonary involvement includes sinusitis, CNS or orbits infections, and vertebral osteomyelitis. Aids in the diagnosis can include surveillance bronchoscopies (bronchoalveolar lavage stain and culture; biopsy), chest CT and serum/BAL galactomannan, beta-D-glucan, and PCR. The presence of pulmonary nodular lesions in invasive infections can carry better outcomes [142]. Voriconazole\nis the treatment of choice. It is important to note that immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can develop at a median of 56 days in 7% of treated lung transplant recipients [143]. In Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, nebulized amphotericin B and debridement of the bronchial anastomosis are important adjuvant measures to systemic antifungal therapy [144, 145]. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia manifests from 1 to 6 months. Its incidence has been reduced dramatically with universal TMP/SMX prophylaxis. Cryptococcosis with a rate of 2% in lung transplant recipients presents with pulmonary involvement, but dissemination with meningitis can occur. Furthermore, Cryptococcus skin manifestations\nlike cellulitis and Cryptococcus-associated IRIS have been documented [146, 147].",

The most common viruses are (1) CMV among the herpes viruses and (2) community-acquired respiratory viruses. As in other SOT recipients, the higher risk to develop CMV infection is among D+/R\u2212, followed by D+/R+, D\u2212/R+, and D\u2212/R\u2212. This last scenario carries less than 5% of risk [48, 148]. Lung transplant recipients possess higher risk for CMV than other SOT with an estimated incidence of 30\u201386% [87]. The lung is considered a primary reservoir for CMV latency, and abundant lymphocytic tissue surrounds the transplanted organ. Additionally, the use of antilymphocyte antibodies to treat rejection or for immunosuppression and other herpesviruses infections are additional risk factors for CMV disease [149]. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 (+874T/T) polymorphism increases IFN levels and may be a predisposition for CMV disease [150]. CMV is significantly associated with BOS, which reduces survival after the first year posttransplant [151]. CMV disease is most commonly manifested by pneumonitis or viral syndrome and less frequently with gastrointestinal disease. Among lung transplant recipients, ganciclovir-resistant CMV carries an increased morbidity and mortality [152].",

These infections are associated with increased risk to develop pneumonia, graft dysfunction manifested by lung function loss, BOS, high calcineurin inhibitor blood levels, and increase mortality [153\u2013155]. These viruses include influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses, human rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumoviruses, and bocaviruses. The hospitalization rates are higher for influenza and parainfluenza (50% and 17%, respectively) [154]. Symptoms are usually nonspecific. Diagnosis often requires detection of viral nucleoprotein antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by enzyme immunoassay or fluorescent antibody or the amplification of nucleic acid by PCR. Ribavirin may possess activity against Paramyxoviruses (RSV, Metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza). Ribavirin\nis administered inhaled, orally, or intravenously. Oseltamivir or zanamivir is the treatment choice of influenza A or B [156]. Adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) are not active against influenza B, and there is a marked increase resistance among influenza A strains [156]. Similarly to other SOT recipients, DNA viruses like non-CMV herpesviruses (HSV-1,-2), VZV, HHV-6,-7,-8, and EBV are a source of significant morbidity including but not limited to CMV-negative viral syndrome, rash, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and encephalitis [157].

Other parasites that can target the lung in immunosuppressive states include Echinococcus, Schistosoma\n, and Strongyloides stercoralis [160]. Strongyloidiasis can present as hyperinfection syndrome [161]. Leishmania, although infrequently seen, has been reported among lung and lung-heart recipients [30]. Free-living amoebas\ncan affect this population as well. Amoebic granulomatous dermatitis and disseminated infection presenting with ulcerative skin lesions, respiratory failure, and seizures have been described in lung transplant recipients [162, 163]. Finally, alimentary protozoa\n, including Cryptosporidium, which present with diarrhea and may elevate tacrolimus levels [164], and microsporidia, which present with unusual manifestations like myositis or granulomatous interstitial nephritis, affects lung transplant recipients [165, 166].",

SSIs are associated with a 35% mortality within the first year of transplantation. The most common organisms found to cause SSI or mediastinitis are P. aeruginosa, Candida species, S. aureus (including MRSA), Enterococcus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Burkholderia cepacia, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella species.

NTM SSI infections can be complicated by progressive disseminated disease or requirement of lifelong suppressive therapy [135]. Other organisms\nsuch as Mycoplasma hominis and Lactobacillus spp. have also been described. Deep infections can affect up to 5% of the patients. Sternal osteomyelitis can reach up to 6% of these deep infections. Causative organisms for sternal osteomyelitis include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Scedosporium.

            "text": "CNS symptoms\ndeveloping during the 1st month following lung or heart-lung transplantation should trigger the concern for donor-derived viral infections. LCMV often is accompanied by CSF normal to low glucose, marked elevated protein, and mild pleocytosis [36]. Although with unclear benefit, ribavirin has been used. Donor-transmitted rabies is an uncommon but neurologic devastating complication that occurs within the first 30 days of transplant. Lung transplantation has been described as a potential causal mechanism [186]. Other organisms known to cause meningitis in lung transplant recipients are Cryptococcus, tuberculosis, WNV, and herpesviruses [187, 188]. Diagnosis of WNV in this setting requires nuclear acid amplification due to the unreliability of serologic testing. Scedosporium apiospermum infections often cause dissemination including CNS\nabscesses in addition to pulmonary involvement among lung transplant recipients [189]. It is important to differentiate from other molds, since amphotericin B is ineffective against Scedosporium spp. In severe cases or refractory disease without an appropriate surgical debridement, the addition of terbinafine to voriconazole may prove to be useful [190]. Other recognized organisms\ncausing occupying brain lesions are Fusarium, Nocardia, Aspergillus, toxoplasmosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Listeria, and Cladophialophora bantiana [191\u2013193]. PML, a late manifestation, can be associated with intensified immunosuppression or rituximab. Cidofovir followed by mirtazapine can be considered as a form of therapy for PML.",
