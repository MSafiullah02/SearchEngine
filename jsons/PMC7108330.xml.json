            "text": "Of the \u223c40 antiviral drugs that have been formally licensed for clinical use [1], 20 are used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AIDS). The anti-HIV compounds fall into five categories: first, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir and emtricitabine; second, the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; third, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz; fourth, the protease inhibitors (PIs), saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir (combined at a 4 to 1 ratio with ritonavir), atazanavir and fosamprenavir; and fifth, the fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide. Lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infections. Of the anti-herpesvirus agents, acyclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir, brivudin, penciclovir, idoxuridine and trifluridine are used (the latter three only topically) in the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and/or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections; ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir and fomivirsen (the latter only by intravitreal injection) have proven useful in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in immunocompromised patients (i.e. AIDS patients that have CMV retinitis). Following the progression of amantadine and rimantadine (matrix 2 protein blockers) onto the market, the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir have become available for the therapy (and prophylaxis) of influenza virus infections. Ribavirin has been used (topically as an aerosol) in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections, and the combination of ribavirin with (pegylated) interferon-\u03b1 has received increased acceptance for the treatment of hepacivirus (hepatitis C virus; HCV) infections.",

Particularly striking are the effects that have been obtained with cidofovir (topical gel application or direct intralesional injection) in the treatment of HPV-associated papillomatous lesions, such as hypopharyngeal and esophageal papilloma, laryngeal papilloma, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (in children), anogenital HPV infections (i.e. condylomata acuminata), bowenoid papulosis (perianal intraepithelial neoplasia), cervical and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade III, recalcitrant warts (including plantar warts), and other mucocutaneous HPV lesions that did not respond to conventional therapies [3\u2022]. In most of these cases, a virtually complete and durable resolution of the lesions was achieved following the application of cidofovir (as a 1% gel or cream).",

This effect might be related to the ability of cidofovir to restore the function of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb (which are neutralized by the oncoproteins E6 and E7, respectively) in HPV-infected cells [3\u2022]. In addition to cidofovir, there are several other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, for example 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine (PMEG; Figure 1) and 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-N6-cyclopropyl-2,6-diaminopurine (cPr PMEDAP; Figure 1), which, like cidofovir, are able to specifically induce apoptosis in HPV-infected keratinocytes.

The latter is only available in some European countries, and, although exquisitely active against VZV, its use is restricted to patients that have herpes zoster or HSV-1 infections. BVDU cannot be administered concomitantly with 5-fluorouracil (which is a cytostatic agent used in the treatment of certain cancers) because through the release of its degradation product, BVU, BVDU can potentiate the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (through inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the degradation of 5-fluorouracil). The newly discovered bicyclic furo(2,3-d)pyrimidine nucleoside analogues (BCNAs; i.e. Cf 1368, Cf 1369, Cf 1742 [Figure 1] and Cf 1743 [Figure 1]) do not have this drawback. Although the BCNAs have proven to be as active, and Cf 1742 and Cf 1743 are 10-fold more active against VZV than BVDU [6, 7], they are unlikely to enhance the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil for two reasons: first, they are not degraded to the free pyrimidine base, and second, the latter was shown not to interfere with the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase that initiates the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil [6]. BCNAs are extremely selective in their anti-VZV activity, in that they inhibit only VZV replication and not the replication of any other viruses such as HSV. With a selectivity index (ratio of 50% cytotoxic concentration to 50% inhibitory concentration against viral replication) in excess of 100 000, the BCNAs offer an unprecedented potential for the treatment of VZV infections.",

This complex comprises three viral proteins \u2014 the HSV UL5, UL-8 and UL52 gene products \u2014 which together unwind the double-stranded viral DNA and generate the primer/templates for DNA synthesis by the viral DNA polymerase.

Compared to ganciclovir and foscarnet, CMV423 showed a higher potency and lower cytotoxicity. However, its antiviral action appeared to be cell-dependent. CMV423 must be targeted at an event that follows viral entry but that precedes viral DNA replication. CMV423 was also found to inhibit total cellular protein tyrosine kinase activity. It was concluded that CMV423 exerts its activity against HHV-6 through inhibition of a cellular process that is crucial in the early stage of viral replication and that might involve protein tyrosine kinase activity [14].",

Several nucleoside analogues (i.e. S2242, 8-methyladenosine and idoxuridine) and nucleotide analogues (including HPMPC [cidofovir] and HPMPO-DAPy) are effective in various animal models of poxvirus infections [15]. In particular, cidofovir has shown high efficacy in protection of mice from a lethal respiratory infection of either vaccinia or cowpox, even after administration of a single systemic (intraperitoneal) or intranasal (aerosolized) dose. Cidofovir has demonstrated high effectiveness in the treatment of disseminated progressive vaccinia in athymic-nude mice [16]. In humans, cidofovir has been used successfully by both the topical and intravenous route in the treatment of orf and recalcitrant molluscum contagiosum in immunocompromised patients (reviewed by De Clercq [17]). These data indicate that cidofovir will be effective in the therapy and prophylaxis of smallpox (variola) and related poxviruses in humans, as well as in the treatment of the complications of vaccinia that can arise in immunocompromised patients inadvertently inoculated with the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia) [17].",

In an outbreak of smallpox, it would be useful to have an orally active drug at hand that could be self-administered [18\u2022]. Therefore, hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir (HDP-CDV) and octadecyloxyethyl-cidofovir (ODE-CDV) were designed and developed as potential (oral) drugs for the prophylaxis and treatment of variola virus infection (Figure 1) [18\u2022]. These alkyloxyalkyl esters of cidofovir were found to significantly enhance inhibition of orthopoxvirus replication (i.e. vaccinia and cowpox) in vitro [19]. When given orally, HDP-CDV and ODE-CDV were as effective as cidofovir is when administered parenterally for the treatment of vaccinia and cowpox infections [20]; HDP-CDV has also proven effective in the treatment of lethal vaccinia virus respiratory infections in mice [21]. Furthermore, when administered orally, HDP-CDV and ODE-CDV proved highly efficacious in a lethal mousepox (aerosol ectromelia virus) model, further attesting the potential usefulness of other lipid prodrugs of cidofovir in the oral therapy and prophylaxis of poxvirus infections.",

This treatment regimen produces a sustained virologic response in at least 50% of the patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and 2 (and 80% of the patients infected with another genotype of HCV). Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 should be treated for at least 48 weeks [24], but this length of time might be reduced to 24 weeks for patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3. In this combination, ribavirin is assumed to act as an immunomodulator, whereas the IFN would act as an antiviral agent targeted at a phosphoprotein encoded by the non-structural NS5A gene of the HCV genome [25].",

Highly selective antiviral agents targeted at the viral RNA replicase have been described to inhibit the replication of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus that could be considered as a surrogate virus for HCV [27, 28]. We have recently described a novel series of compounds (e.g. prototype 5-[(4-bromophenyl)methyl]-2-phenyl-5H-imidazo[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\u2022, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\u2022, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40\u2022, 41, 42, 43, 44\u2022, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53\u2022, 54, 55, 56\u2022, 57, 58, 59, 60\u2022\u2022]pyridine [also known as BPIP; Figure 1]) that act as \u2018non-nucleoside\u2019 RdRp inhibitors; these inhibit the replication of BVDV with high efficiency [29]. From this class of compounds, based on a different structure\u2013activity relationship, new congeners have been derived that act equally efficiently against HCV replication. In the future treatment of HCV infections, these non-nucleoside RdRp inhibitors are likely to be combined with the \u2018nucleoside\u2019 RdRp inhibitors. An example of the latter, albeit a relatively weak inhibitor of BVDV and HCV, is N4-hydroxycytidine [30].",

            "text": "There are several HCV proteins encoded by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that could be considered as targets for chemotherapeutic intervention: the spike (S) protein, the SARS-CoV main protease (also known as the 3C-like protease), the NTPase/helicase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and, possibly, other viral (or cellular) protein-mediated processes [31]. The SARS-CoV S protein mediates infection of permissive cells by controlling the interaction of its S1 domain with cells that express the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [32]. A 193-amino acid fragment of the S protein (that corresponds to amino acid residues 318\u2013510) was found to block S protein-mediated infection [33], and a human monoclonal antibody to the S1 domain was found to neutralize SARS-CoV by blocking its association with the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 [34]. In addition to ACE2, the C-type lectin CD209L (also called L-SIGN) was identified recently as a receptor for SARS-CoV (as well as for other enveloped viruses, including Ebola); thus, CD209L, like ACE2, might be a target for blocking SARS-CoV infection. Also, to the extent that the fusogenic mechanism of HIV is similar to that of SARS-CoV (e.g. with regard to heptad repeat interactions and six-helix bundle formation), it should be feasible to develop SARS-CoV fusion inhibitors analogous to enfuvirtide, which is used for treatment of HIV [35].",

According to this hypothesis, ribavirin would act as an RNA virus mutagen, forcing the RNA virus into gaining a lethal accumulation of errors. This error catastrophe has been shown only with poliovirus; it has not been demonstrated with other RNA viruses such as HIV or HCV. For flaviviruses (such as yellow fever) and paramyxoviruses (such as parainfluenza), the predominant mechanism by which ribavirin exerts its antiviral activity in vitro appears to be based on inhibition of inosine 5\u2019-monophosphate dehydrogenase [41, 49].",

Upon prolonged exposure (in cell culture, in vitro) of HIV to Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin or to Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, the virus acquires resistance mutations in the gp120 glycoprotein that are predominantly located at the N-glycosylation (asparagine) sites [58]. In addition to their role as topical microbicides, plant lectins might, due to their propensity to deplete the viral envelope of its glycan shield [59], force the virus to convert to a gp120 phenotype that can no longer escape the immune surveillance of the host.",

This chemical evolution starting from TIBO R-86183 in 1987 has yielded compound R-278474, which shows activity against both wild-type and NNRTI mutant (K103N + Y181C) HIV-1 strains at sub-nanomolar concentrations. The discovery of R-278474 emanated from a coordinated multidisciplinary effort that involved medicinal chemists, virologists, crystallographers, molecular modellers, toxicologists, analytical chemists and pharmacists, among others [60\u2022\u2022]. R-278474 highlights the important requirements of novel anti-HIV drugs: high antiviral potency against wild-type and mutant viruses, high oral bioavailability (allowing once-daily administration), minimal side effects, and ease of synthesis and formulation.",

I have also discussed therapeutic approaches, both present and future, for HCV infections, antiviral strategies for the management of SARS, and the importance of having neuraminidase inhibitors at hand to affront future influenza virus epidemics. Possible strategies for the prevention and treatment of hemorrhagic fever virus infections are identified, and the many new (candidate) antiviral drugs that have been developed for the treatment of HIV infections (AIDS) are also reviewed.",
