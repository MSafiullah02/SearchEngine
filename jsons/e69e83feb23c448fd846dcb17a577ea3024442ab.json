Currently no study reported the profile of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Profile of specific antibodies in patients' blood can assist diagnosis and reflect the disease course. Here, we first studied the profile of IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 from 34 COVID-19 patients.",

All enrolled patients were confirmed diagnosed of COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 from Chinese National Health Committee (Version 5) and the interim guidance from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 5 , 6 Blood samples were obtained at different date after onset of symptoms to detect the specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG were analyzed by chemiluminescent immunoassay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shenzhen Yahuilong Biotechnology Co., Ltd). All data (test dates and results of IgM and IgG) were collected up to the final follow-up date (March 3rd, 2020).",

Except for two patients (2 days and 3 days after symptoms onset), all included patients had IgM and IgG tests after 2 weeks from symptoms onset. We categorized patients by weeks according to the date of antibodies test after symptoms onset. In week 3 after symptoms onset, all patients were tested positive for IgM and IgG, with the mean value of 322.80AU/ml and 112.40AU/ml (Reference: < 10AU/ml) respectively. In week 4, all the results were still positive for IgM and IgG. IgM declined while IgG continued to go up, with the mean value of 147.92AU/ml and 157.01AU/ml respectively. In week 5, however, all patients were positive for IgG, while 2 patients (16.7%) got negative results for IgM. IgM level kept going down to 78.03AU/ml and IgG continued up to 163.56AU/ml. At the end of observation (7 weeks), 2 patients (33.3%) got negative results for IgM, while all patients positive for IgG, with the mean value of 21.83AU/ml and 167.16AU/ml respectively. ( Fig. 1 ) Genomic studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 shared around 80% identity sequencing with SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases worldwide in 20 02-20 03. 7 Study of case series suggested the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV. 3 For SARS-CoV, studies revealed that IgM reached the highest point within 4 weeks and was not detectable on 3 months after onset of symptoms. IgG were persistently detectable up to 24 months. 8 Our results suggested that the profile of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV. Detectable and continuous high level of IgM indicated the acute phase of infection. Furthermore, IgM last more than a month indicating the prolonged virus replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. IgG responded later than IgM and persisted high in our study, indicating the humoral immune reaction to protect the body against SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
