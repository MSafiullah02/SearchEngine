Objectives: To study the importance of abdominal sonograms in neonatal foals suffering from gastrointestinal conditions and to describe the clinical features of necrotising gastrointestinal disease. Hypothesis: There is a subgroup of neonates with sonographically detectable pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), reflecting a necrotising disease. Methods: Records of foals aged \u05457 days hospitalised from 2005 to 2009 with signs of gastrointestinal disease were evaluated (n = 89). The association of sonographic, clinical and clinicopathological signs with necrotising gastrointestinal disease and outcome was determined. Results: PI was imaged in 19 foals. Twenty-seven foals were classified as having necrotising gastrointestinal disease based on the presence of gastrointestinal signs (colic, diarrhoea, gastric reflux or abdominal distension) and sonographic PI (n = 19), surgical (n = 2) or pathological (n = 6) evidence of gastrointestinal necrosis. There was a difference between survival rate in foals with and without necrotising disease (33.3 and 69.4%, respectively, P = 0.005) or foals with and without PI detected sonographically (36.8 and 72.1%, respectively, P = 0.023). PI was the only sonographic finding associated with outcome. Prematurity, the presence of blood in the faeces, gastric reflux, abdominal distension, abnormal echogenicity of the colon and the lowest white blood cell count during hospitalisation were associated with necrotising gastrointestinal disease (P<0.05). Conclusions and potential relevance: Abdominal sonograms have prognostic value in neonatal gastrointestinal disease. PI and the presence of necrotising gastrointestinal disease were common and associated with a poor prognosis.",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal (GI) disease is common in equine neonates. Foals presented for abdominal pain or diarrhoea may be easily identified as suffering from GI disease. However, neonates with other clinical presentations, such as sepsis, prematurity or perinatal asphyxia syndrome, may show nonspecific signs, with GI disease being one of many components of the process. Furthermore, clinical and clinicopathological signs overlap between these other disease conditions. Case management varies between various diseases and prognoses differ. Abdominal ultrasonography has proved useful in the assessment of human and veterinary cases with different conditions. In human critical care units, the time from presentation to operative care, length of hospitalisation, complications and cost decrease when abdominal sonograms are performed during emergency evaluations, potentially due to a more rapid diagnosis (Levy and Noble 2008) . In paediatric colitis (Baud et al. 2004 ) and GI emergencies (Puylaert 2001; Pastore et al. 2007 ) sonographic findings correlate with anatomical distribution of the disease or diagnosis and often help patient management. Abdominal ultrasonography is well described in equine neonates (Reef 1998; McAuliffe 2004; Reef 2004; Porter and Ramirez 2005) ; however, studies that quantify its usefulness, accuracy and limitations are scarce.",

            "text": "Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease process of the GI tract of neonates that results in inflammation and bacterial invasion of the bowel wall. Necrotising enterocolitis occurs frequently in human newborn intensive care units (Babcock 2002; Thompson and Bizzarro 2008) , primarily in premature neonates (Lee and Polin 2003; Obladen 2009 ). Necrotising enterocolitis has been described in foals in isolated case reports (Cudd and Pauly 1987; Yager 1987; Jones et al. 1988; East et al. 1998 ) and several texts have suggested that it may be an under recognised syndrome (Slovis 2003; Magdesian 2005; Vaala 2009; Wilkins 2010) . The diagnosis of NEC in human infants is based on clinical and imaging findings. The presence of intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis, PI) is considered virtually pathognomonic for necrotising enterocolitis in neonates with a compatible clinical picture (Walsh and Kliegman 1986; St. Peter et al. 2003; Epelman et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2007) . Radiographic documentation of PI is the current standard to confirm NEC diagnosis in man, but the sonographic detection of PI has been shown to be both sensitive and specific ) and to have a growing and evolving role in the evaluation of these patients ).",

Abnormalities in bowel wall echogenicity were areas of increased, decreased or heterogeneous echogenicity within the intestinal wall (Fig 2) . Functional abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract were defined as abnormalities in the contents or motility of the affected portion of the GI tract. Motility was considered normal if there were frequent, rhythmic peristaltic waves. Subjectively increased, decreased or arrhythmic contractions were considered abnormal. The stomach was not evaluated for motility disorders. Ileus was defined as diffuse hypomotility and distension of the gastrointestinal viscera (Fig 3) . Abnormal peritoneal fluid was defined as fluid that is hypoechoic to echoic or increased in amount (Reef 2004; Porter and Ramirez 2005) (Fig 4) .

The presenting complaint was categorised as colic, diarrhoea or other. If there were multiple complaints, the problem prompting hospitalisation was chosen for analysis. Foals were considered premature or to have respiratory distress if clinicians recorded these in the medical records. Foals were considered to have pneumonia if recorded by the clinician or pathologist. Necrotising gastrointestinal disease was defined as signs of GI disease and sonographic evidence of PI or surgical or pathological evidence of necrosis of the intestinal wall. Continuous sonographic variables recorded were the thickness of stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and caecum. The continuous clinicopathological variables recorded were highest white blood cell count (WBCC), lowest WBCC, lowest total protein (TP), highest fibrinogen, plasma IgG concentration (DVM Rapid Test) a at presentation, highest lactate concentration, lowest PaO2 and highest PaCO2.",

Differences were reported as observed. The statistical software Stata 11.1 b was used for the analysis. A P value of 0.05 was used to distinguish significant from nonsignificant associations.

Variables related to feeding strategies were excluded owing to heterogeneity of feedings before presentation and changes during hospitalisation. There were 48 males and 41 females. There were 58 Thoroughbreds, 15 Standardbreds, 6 Warmbloods, 4 Arabians and 6 foals of other breeds. Twenty-four foals presented for colic, 8 for diarrhoea (4 had colic and diarrhoea as presenting complaints but abdominal pain prompted referral) and 57 presented with other complaints. These included weakness/depression (n = 15), the result of a high risk pregnancy (n = 7), dystocia (n = 6), neonatal encephalopathy (n = 6), recumbency (n = 4), straining to urinate (n = 4), failure to nurse (n = 3), premature placental separation (n = 3), respiratory distress (n = 2), prematurity (n = 2), ruptured bladder (n = 1), septic shock (n = 1), anaemia (n = 1), flexural deformity (n = 1) and haemorrhage (n = 1). Forty-seven neonates did not have signs of gastrointestinal disease recorded at presentation and developed them during hospitalisation. The mean \u03ee s.d. age at presentation was 1.9 \u03ee 1.4 days. Abdominal ultrasound examinations were performed stall-side in 62 neonates. PI was most frequently imaged as scattered hyperechoic foci within the intestinal wall, although large clusters of hyperechoic foci within the bowel wall were also imaged in some foals. The intramural gas was imaged more frequently in the small intestine (57.9%, 11/19) than in the large intestine (31.6%, 6/19), and infrequently (10.5%, 2/19) in both the small and the large intestine. Twenty-seven foals were classified as having necrotising disease based on the clinical signs of GI disease and sonographic evidence of PI (19), and/or surgical (2) or pathological (6) evidence of necrosis. Post mortem examinations were performed in 4 foals with sonographic PI and, in 2 cases, histology was consistent with necrotising disease. Another foal with sonographic PI had an exploratory laparotomy and showed extensive macroscopic abnormalities most consistent with necrotising GI disease, including intramural gas.",

Respiratory distress syndrome or congenital heart disease has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of NEC in human neonates by causing hypoxic mucosal injury (Guner et al. 2008) . We tested the association between respiratory disease, arterial blood gases values and congenital heart disease with the presence of necrotising gastrointestinal disease and no association was found. The number of neonates with congenital heart disease in this series was small (n = 3) and therefore the lack of association could be due to lack of statistical power. Bacteraemia has been documented in up to 35% of NEC cases in children (Lee and Polin 2003) and some authors have hypothesised that NEC is a contagious disease, implicating Klebsiella, E. coli, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Pseudomona, Clostridia, Staphylococci, coronavirus, rotavirus or enterovirus (Walsh and Kliegman 1986) .

Rotating the transducer, changing subject position and the use of higher frequency transducers with excellent resolution help in distinguishing PI from artefacts (pseudopneumatosis intestinalis) . Only subjects in which the hyperechoic echoes of gas were confidently imaged within the wall were classified as having PI in this study. Statistical analysis of the correlation between sonographic and histological changes was not performed owing to the small number of cases that had both. Results are presented as abnormal individuals/total and percentages in parenthesis. Continuous data are presented as mean \u03ee s.d. PI = pneumatosis intestinalis. SI = small intestine, LI = large intestine. * denotes variables for which significant differences were found between the 2 groups (P<0.05).",

Therefore, a prospective study assessing the maturity of the foal, the feeding practices, clinical findings, clinicopathological findings, ultrasonographic findings and the results of surgical intervention should be performed to further study this disease affecting neonatal foals. Prospective examination of tissue samples from foals with sonographically diagnosed PI is indicated to further study the association between sonographic PI and pathological necrotising GI disease. The sonographic evaluation of the neonatal intestine should include colour Doppler assessment of intestinal blood flow, as submucosal blood flow characterisation using colour Doppler sonography correlates well with histology and outcome and allows differentiation of focal from diffuse necrosis in human neonates (Faingold et al. 2005) . Normal descriptions of the sonographic appearance of the neonatal GI tract, including measurements of wall thicknesses and assessment of intestinal blood flow, also need to be obtained.",

The prevention, detection and clinical needs of equine neonates with necrotising GI disease deserve further attention.",
