            "text": "86Immune responses against viruses are rather heterogeneous. An efficient intervention of innate 87 immunity, with its cellular and soluble components, is fundamental to combat the early phases of a primary 88 infection by cytopathic viruses. In the case of Influenza-virus, such early phases, characterised by the 89 intervention of interferons type I (IFN), NK cells and other cells of the innate Immunity, are followed by the 90 generation of virus-specific CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) which may control viremia after 3-4 days.91The first, low affinity, IgM specific antibodies (Abs) appear after 6-7 days while the high affinity IgG and92 IgA Abs require 3-4 weeks. This time interval implies that Abs do not contribute to the recovery from a 93 primary influenza infection, while they protect from secondary infections and can be used for 94 seroprophylaxis. The situation is quite different in non-cytopathic virus infections such as HBV, in which the 95 immune response itself may cause major damages to the host. In this case, the viral load and the quality of 96 immune response determine different outcomes ranging from complete recovery to fulminant hepatitis. 97 Influenza virus and HBV infections are two paradigmatic and opposite conditions. However, an array of 98 immune response-virus interactions and consequent pathologies exist. 1 Unraveling such interactions 99 occurring in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be a crucial challenge to better address more 100 effective therapeutic strategies. 101 First, we do not have information on the innate responses to SARS-CoV-2. For example, the reported 102 lymphopenia may suggest a deficiency in NK cells (which provide an important cellular barrier during early 103 viral infections) in patients with severe disease. Both phenotypic and functional studies on NK subsets 104 should be performed in these patients in comparison with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic ones. It may 105 well be that, in the latter individuals, an efficient innate response may control the virus and/or allow 106 sufficient time to mount an efficient T cell response resulting in absent or mild symptoms. Detection of high 107 numbers of CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood (PB) and evidence of their specificity for viral peptides would 108 provide a clue for an ongoing effective, cell-mediated immune response. Of note, in the case of COVID-19, 109 given the relatively long interval between viral infection and the onset of symptoms, this T-. Of note, in SARS patients, some NAbs targeting non-RBD regions of S protein 118 caused an antibody-dependent enhancement effect on viral infectivity and disease. 1 A very recent study on 119 26 patient who recovered from COVID-19 revealed that, while the majority developed Abs specific for S 120 protein, only in 3 cases they were specific for the RBD domain. 2 Although these data may pose serious 121 questions regarding the establishment of a protective immunity, they may offer an important clue for 122 selecting appropriate epitopes in the development of effective vaccines. Since S protein or mRNA are being 123 used in novel vaccine preparations, the previous finding poses serious problems on the efficacy of induced 124 Abs response and imposes to establish the protection degree given by memory T cells. Another hurdle is 125 expected in the use of effective adjuvants, particularly because elderly people are frequently highly 126 susceptible to the virus and poor responders to vaccinations. 127 Table 1 summarizes the main aspects of immunity towards the three rCoVs. 3-6 128 Thus, at present, immunologic studies suffer of important limitations related to i. lack of information 129 on asymptomatic individuals who could mount highly effective cellular and/or humoral immune responses, 130 ii. scarce knowledge of the changes in PB lymphocyte numbers, composition and function in individuals 131 with progressive disease, iii. no data on the regulatory mechanisms (cells and cytokines) during infection 132 impairing the clearance of the virus and favoring its immune evasion. 133 Further important information on immune mechanisms capable of controlling COVID-19 may come 134 from females and pediatric patients. Indeed, in most instances, children develop a mild form of the disease (if 135 any). Different explanations could be proposed. Thus children, in view of the high plasticity of their adaptive 136 responses, particularly in their B cell compartment, could more efficiently clear the virus. 7 To this favorable 137 situation may contribute also innate immunity, challenged/trained by frequent infections and by 138 vaccines/adjuvants administered in early life. In addition, the lower susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-139 2 could be due to the lower density of ACE-2 receptors as compared to adults. 8 140 The lower frequency of infection and mortality in women could be related to hormonal and genetic 141 differences, to lower incidence of comorbidities affecting the lung (COPD, smoke, etc), or to higher 142 prevalence of autoimmune-and allergic disorders, as the result of some decreased regulatory mechanism. In 143 comparison with men, women usually show: i. less viral load levels and less inflammation with higher CD4+ 144 T cells and Abs responses; ii lower expression of serine protease TMPRSS2 (the S protein priming) in 145 tissues and ACE2 in the lung; iii. overexpressed TLR8, CD40L, CXCR3 (encoded by X chromosome) all 146 influencing anti-viral response; iv. overexpressed TLR7 (the crucial sensor for RNA viruses as SARS-CoV-147",

            "text": "13 , iii. the topical administration of anti-allergic therapies may directly protect the 157 patients' airways from viral spread, taking into account that some coronavirus strains are inhibited in vitro by 158 combinations of nebulized asthma therapeuticals. 15 Finally, very recently it has been shown that epithelial 159 cells of respiratory mucosa from allergic patients express less ACE2 molecules than healthy donors and that 160 IL-13, a crucial molecule of type 2 response, is negatively related to the ACE2 expression. 16 161 Other important missing information regards the mechanisms by which the virus may escape the 162 immune response. Of note, data on rCoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, indicate that these pathogens are 163 particularly prone to evade immune detection and dampen human immune responses. 17 Taking into account 164 that susceptible HLA aplotypes, high viral load and previous impaired immunity may contribute to the virus 165 escape of immune response, based on the knowledge of other human rCoVs, some other not-mutually 166 exclusive mechanisms of immune evasion can be hypothesized for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). 167 The first mechanism relies on early inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) recognition and signaling by infected 168 cells. In rCoVs IFN is suppressed through different mechanisms directly or indirectly interfering with the 169 signaling of RNA receptors. 18 Present limitations concern whether and how much the reduced IFN 170 production may compromise the viral control, leading to severe consequences to infected host. Data of the 171 timing of IFN response could be informative also for therapy: some intensive care (IC) units in Italy included 172 inhaled IFN-1\u03b2 in therapeutic protocols. 173 Related to the previous mechanism is the possible early functional inhibition/alteration of cells of the innate 174 immunity such as macrophages, DC and NK cells. Thus, beside a possible cytopathic effect of the virus, 175 viral TLR ligands could directly or indirectly induce an unwanted polarization of these cells towards 176 inefficient type-2 responses. This would have deleterious consequences not only on the anti-virus activity of 177 the innate cells themselves (i.e. sharply compromised NK cytotoxicity and production of useful cytokines, 178 M2 polarization of macrophages, etc) but also on downstream adaptive responses. These could reflect an 179 impaired NK-mediated DC editing, the activity of M2 macrophages etc. 19,20 As a consequence neither Th1-180 or Tc1-mediated efficient anti-virus responses could be elicited. Concerning the cytopathic activity of the 181 virus, lymphopenia has been described in more than 80% of IC patients and correlates with disease severity. 182 The few data from autopsies indicated that lung infiltrates consist of activated macrophages with minimal 183 lymphocytic component associated with lymphocyte depletion in spleen. 21 It has been shown that SARS-184 CoV and MERS-CoV directly infect T cells, contributing to lymphopenia and atrophy of lymphoid tissues, 185 thus representing a key component in the viral-induced pathogenesis. 1 It is urgent to confirm and expand 186 these data and to acquire solid information on cytopathic activity of the virus on cell subsets. macrophages may favor T cell suppression or deviation to less protective cell profiles (i.e. Th2). 23 192 The detection of circulating effector and regulatory memory T cells or adaptive cytokines during the early 193 phases of infection when lymphopenia is still mild, could be informative for prognosis. 4,24 Notably, the 194 identification of conserved immunodominant T cell epitopes, shall have implications for vaccine design. 25,26 195 One or more of the immune evasion mechanisms with other factors as, for instance, the different 196 viral load or the prexisting impaired immune response can likely contribute to the immunopathogenesis of 197 COVID-19 (Fig.2). Of note, when the infected organism is unable to mount an adequate immune response to 198 the virus, as a compensatory mechanism, a persistent monocyte/macrophage-induced hyperinflammation 199 predominates. Among other sensors, viral RNAs are essentially recognized by TLRs (as TLR7/8, TLR3) 200 activating three intracellular pathways leading to the IFN production (through MyD88 and IRF7), expression 201 of costimulatory molecules for T cell activation (through TRAF6 and IRF3) and production of pro-202 inflammatory molecules (through p38MAPK and AP-1). It has been hypothesized that the inhibition by 203 rCoVs of the first two pathways at different levels may favor the hyperactivation of p38MAPK in infected 204 monocytes/macrophages leading to hyperproduction of cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins. 27 205 Indeed most IC patients with COVID-19 show high levels of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1) and chemokines 206 (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10), indicating overexpression of a pro-inflammatory condition (the 207 so-called Macrophage Activation Syndrome) in disease progression and explaining the massive homing of 208 immune cells into tissues. 1,28 Indeed a proportion of severe patients develops a hypersensitivity-like 209 pneumonia and a subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) sustained by a Cytokine Release 210 Syndrome (CRS). Others can develop a secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), a 211 hyperinflammatory condition characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan 212 failure, just reported in some COVID-19. 29 Finally some patients can develop a Disseminated Intravascular 213 Coagulation (DIC) due to the cytokine-driven epithelial and endothelial cell damage/apoptosis with 214 increased vascular leakage, 30 hyperexpression of tissue factors and chronic triggering of coagulation. 31 215 ARDS, CRS, sHLH and DIC constitute the final pathological pictures of COVID-19, each being able to set 216 off the multiorgan failure and death. (Fig.2) Importantly, comorbidities and concomitant therapies (ACE-217 inhibitors?) can influence/enhance the above cascade of events.218 Therefore, during infection it is crucial to monitor the cytokines responsible for hyperinflammation 219 and to block their activity by using approved therapies addressed to reduce the rising mortality (i.e.",

In addition, a high viral 318 load may overcome the barriers of the immune responses. 319 Notably, viruses escaping control may inhibit type-1 IFN, infect cells of both innate and adaptive immunity 320 by exerting a cytopathic effect. In turn, the compromised function of immune cells and the impaired anti-321 viral effect of IFN would further favor immune evasion, resulting in highly detrimental pathological effects. 322 Tentative pathogenetic mechanisms of severe COVID-19 324 The mechanisms of immune evasion adopted by SARS-CoV-2 with other factors as the viral load or the 325 impaired immune response can contribute to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.
