When viral infection is detected by pattern recognition receptors, infected cells produce type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type III (\u03bb) interferons (IFNs) [1]. Binding of IFNs to their specific receptors leads to the induction of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes, including OAS1, which encodes the enzyme 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) [2]. Typically, OAS1 is activated by the binding of double-stranded RNA and catalyzes the oligomerization of ATP into 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) [3], [4]. These 2-5A, in turn, bind to latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), which then dimerizes into an active form. The activated RNase L degrades viral and cellular single-stranded RNA [5].",

            "text": "To date, polymorphisms of OAS1 and other immune-related genes have been reported to affect susceptibility to a variety of viral diseases [11]. In mice, a single missense mutation of the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1B (Oas1b) gene, a murine ortholog of OAS1, determines resistance to flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV) [12], [13]. In humans, the A allele of SNP rs10774671 in OAS1 was associated with susceptibility to infection with WNV [14]. An OAS1 SNP (rs2660) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs10774671 [10] was also associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [15]. However, the allele associated with susceptibility to infection varied among studies, and the production of different OAS1 isoforms have not yet been fully investigated [16]. Considering that the interactions between virus and host are complex and cell-type-specific, OAS1 expression patterns should be characterized in a particular cell type infected by a virus of interest. In particular, host genetic factors affecting the airway defense mechanism against emerging respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza, which pose potential global threats, should be studied intensively in preparation for future outbreaks.",

Thus, their expression levels would be expected to be determined by the efficiency of splicing and mRNA stability.",

Interestingly, the amount of p42 isoform was about half that of the p46 isoform in the GG cells at the protein level, although mRNA expression of the p42 transcript was markedly lower than that of the p46 transcript in those cells. Laronde et al. reported that the p42 transcript accounted for 5% of the total OAS1 transcripts in a lymphoblast cell line with a GG genotype, as determined by RNA sequencing [19]; this was in accord with the results obtained from our absolute quantification method. The translational efficiency may differ between p42 and p46 transcripts because they have distinct 3\u2032-UTR sequences that may differentially bind to RNA-binding proteins [29] or to micro RNAs [30]. In Daudi lymphoid cells with a GG genotype [10], only the p46 isoform was detected [26]. Therefore, expression of the p42 isoform in cells bearing a GG genotype may be specific to the cell type, presumably through tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing [31].",

Bonnevie-Nielsen et al. reported that the total enzyme activity of OAS1 in unstimulated lymphocytes was highest in individuals with the GG genotype, intermediate in those with the AG genotype, and lowest in those with the AA genotype. They raised the possibility that the p46 isoform, arising from the G allele, has higher enzymatic activity than the p48 and p52 isoforms arising from the A allele. This suggests that individuals carrying the A allele are more susceptible to some viruses; consequently, Lim et al. demonstrated that the A allele was associated with susceptibility to WNV infection and that WNV replicated to higher levels in lymphoid tissues from donors carrying the A allele [14]. Lin et al. reported that p42 and p46, but not the other OAS1 isoforms (p44b, p48, and p52), blocked dengue viral replication via an RNase L-dependent mechanism [16]. Since HBE cells produce a considerable amount of the p42 isoform in the presence of the AA genotype, functional roles of the A allele are worth reconsidering in respiratory virus infection.",

            "text": "In our study, NE-induced cellular DNA fragmentation was preferentially found in HBE cells with the AA genotype when stimulated with IFN-\u03b2. NE is a major apoptotic inducer in inflamed airway epithelium, and Suzuki et al. showed molecular mechanisms of leukocyte elastase-induced apoptosis in HBE cells [32]. We also found that NE increased the level of annexin-V staining in an immortalized HBE cell line, BEAS-2B (unpublished observation). However, we could not further investigate other key features of apoptosis than DNA fragmentation in the present study, because the number of experiments using primary cultured cells had limitations. Since the p48 isoform arising from the A allele was previously shown to have proapoptotic activity independent of RNase L activation [7], it is conceivable that the increased DNA fragmentation in HBE cells with the AA genotype is attributed to this unique activity of the p48 isoform that is presumably absent in the cells with the GG genotype. RNase L activation may not be involved in the difference observed in the present study because OAS enzymatic activity is detectable in the presence of exogenous dsRNA [4]. However, it remains elusive whether genotypic differences in DNA fragmentation was derived from the p48 isoform, because its protein expression was not detected by the sensitivity of Western blotting. Alternatively, the predominant p42 isoform in cells bearing the AA genotype may be related to DNA fragmentation through an unknown mechanism. It is generally known that apoptosis can contribute to protection against viral infection by killing virus-infected cells, but it may also serve as a mechanism for virus-induced tissue injury and progression of disease [33]. We have postulated that HBE cells carrying the A allele are more likely to inhibit spreading of the virus infection through promotion of apoptosis of virus-infected cells; thus, the A allele is associated with resistance to SARS infection [17]. Our findings indicate a requirement for further understanding of allele-specific functions other than classical enzymatic activity of OAS isoforms.",
