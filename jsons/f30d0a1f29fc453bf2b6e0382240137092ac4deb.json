            "text": "Globoid cell leucodystrophy (GLD), i.e., Krabbe's disease in human neurology, is a rare inherited neurometabolic disease that results from a deficiency of lysosomal hydrolase galactosylceramidase (galactocerebroside-b-galactosidase; GALC) activity. The disease is characterized by symmetrical demyelination, loss of oligodendrocytes, and accumulation, especially perivascularly, of large phagocytic cells (globoid cells) containing nonsudanophilic, non-metachromatic, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material (Suzuki and Suzuki, 2002) . Galactosylceramide, which cannot be degraded because of the underlying GALC deficiency, elicits infiltration of haematogenous macrophages, which phagocytize undegradable galactosylceramide and are transformed into the characteristic globoid cells. Early and extensive loss of oligodendrocytes has been considered a consequence of the accumulation of psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which is also a substrate for the GALC enzyme. Indeed, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell death via an apoptotic mechanism has been demonstrated (Zaka and Wenger, 2004) .",

            "text": "On post-mortem examination no gross changes were observed. Histological lesions were restricted to the central and peripheral nervous systems and were almost identical in both cases. Bilateral and symmetrical myelin loss, of variable intensity, was observed at different levels within the neuraxis; there was, however, sparing of some white matter structures, such as arcuate subcortical fibres, internal and external capsule, anterior and posterior commissure, alveus, cerebral peduncles, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, white matter of the cerebellar foliae, pyramids, and the fasciculus proprius of the spinal cord. The most severely affected regions were deep white matter areas, such as the corona radiata, corpus callosum, optic tracts, optic radiation, fimbria, fornix, inferior cerebellar peduncles, and subcortical white matter of the cerebellum. In these regions, the leucodystrophic process was active and conspicuous aggregates of large, rounded macrophages (globoid cells) were observed, mainly perivascularly. The globoid cells measured 10 to 35 mm in diameter and had abundant cytoplasm, which was faintly eosinophilic, strongly PASpositive (Fig. 1) , ORO-negative, and non-metachromatic. Nuclei were round to oval with finely dispersed chromatin and a single prominent nucleolus. Frequently, the globoid cells were multinucleated with eccentric, flattened, and closely packed nuclei. Numerous globoid cells were scattered throughout the white matter tissue, which showed occasional foci of malacia. In cat 2, multiple basophilic, PAS-positive calcospherites, 5 to 15 mm in diameter, often with a lamellar pattern, were observed within the necrotic areas of the subcortical white matter of the cerebellum. Occasional focal perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes were intermixed with the globoid cell collections in the corona radiata and medulla oblongata of cat 1. In both cases, the active leucodystrophic process was accompanied by an extensive astrocyte reaction, with the presence of gemistocytic astrocytes. In some regions of the neuraxis, such as the gyral white matter of the cerebrum, white matter at all levels of the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots, the infiltration by globoid cells was less pronounced; nevertheless, loss of myelin was demonstrated by LFB staining. Particularly evident in cat 2, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of astrocytes were marked in these areas and often the reactive astrocytes were binucleated or were arranged in pairs or small groups (Fig. 2) . Astrogliosis and proliferation of microglial cells were also observed in the deeper layers of the cerebral cortex and diffusely in the thalamus, midbrain, and grey matter of the spinal cord. Transverse sections of cranial nerve roots revealed myelin loss, infiltration by globoid cells, and fibrosis. Examination of longitudinal sections of the spinal cord and caudal brain stem with silver staining did not reveal significant neuroaxonal changes, except for axonal necrosis in the spinocerebellar tracts of the medulla oblongata. Marked astrogliosis and neuronal loss with some shrunken and hypereosinophilic neurons were observed in the olivary and cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 3) . Neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brain stem, cerebellar cortex and spinal cord were normal, and no significant changes were observed in the cells of the choroid plexus, ependymal layer or pineal gland. Ultrastructural examination of the globoid cells disclosed moderately electron-dense, straight or slightly curved tubular intracytoplasmic inclusions of crystalloid appearance, admixed with myelin debris (Fig. 4) . Semi-thin sections of peroneal nerves showed numerous fibres with abnormally thin myelin sheaths, accompanied by multifocal myelin splitting and ballooning of the myelin sheath. \"Onion bulb\" formations were not observed. The nerve fibres often had a bizarre shape due to the presence of pale inclusions in the Schwann cells (Fig. 5) . A few globoid cells were detected and, at the ultrastructural level, showed typical The histopathological and ultrastructural findings in the central and peripheral nervous system were consistent with GLD. The disease is characterized by severe myelin degeneration and necrosis throughout the central nervous system, with typical PAS-positive, non-sudanophilic, non-metachromatic, globoid-type macrophages, often clustered around blood vessels. Although the neuropathological picture of GLD is highly characteristic, a definitive diagnosis requires biochemical assays to demonstrate the enzymatic deficit or a genetic test to disclose mutations. This latter test is available for the dog in some laboratories (Victoria et al., 1996) but is not applicable to the cat because the feline GALC gene has not yet been cloned. In cats, GLD was diagnosed in two female kittens humanely destroyed at 6.5 and 8.5 weeks of age (Johnson, 1970) . These cases, which resulted from inbreeding, were characterized by posterior ataxia, ascending incoordination, and occasional generalized tremors. In a female domestic longhaired cat, initial signs were body tremors and tetraparesis at 8 weeks of age (Sigurdson et al., 2002) . The cat died at 21 weeks of age having developed pelvic limb paralysis, muscle atrophy and respiratory distress. In the present study, the neurological signs were similar, but also included loss of pain perception and cranial nerve involvement, suggesting a more severe form or an advanced stage of the disease. In all three cats described by others (see above), histopathology was morphologically and topographically similar to that observed in the present study, but neither ultrastructural findings nor peripheral nerve lesions were described. Perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes, as observed in cat 1, have been described in the white matter of human GLD patients and in the twitcher mouse during the early stage of demyelination; successively they disappeared, despite continuous demyelination. These findings may indicate either a specific involvement of immunological factors in the pathogenesis of the disease, or a non-specific reaction to degenerating tissue components (Ohno et al., 1993) . Occasional foci of mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration of the leptomeninges were found in one of the cats described by Johnson (1970) . Multiple necrotic foci with calcium deposits, as observed in cat 2, were described by Suzuki and Suzuki (2002) in neuropathological reports of late-onset human cases. Loss of neurons in the dentate nucleus and the inferior olivary nuclei further characterizes human GLD but has not been previously reported in domestic animals. Peripheral nerve pathology was particularly severe in our cats, but qualitatively comparable with the changes described in canine GLD, in which reduction in width of myelin lamellae, infiltration by globoid cells, and typical inclusions in both globoid and Schwann cells have been documented (Kurtz and Fletcher, 1970) .",

The clinical signs, which resemble those of the canine disease, are characterized by early posterior dysmetria and ascending incoordination, and generalized tremors. These signs, associated with paraplegia and loss of deep pain perception, as observed in the present study, distinguish GLD from other feline inborn neurometabolic diseases and cerebellar hypoplasia. Clinicians and pathologists should be alerted by these findings, so that fresh tissue samples may be obtained for specific tests, such as culture of skin fibroblasts and enzymatic analyses, with the aim of characterizing the disease in cats more fully.",
