Lower respiratory infection (LRI), including pneumonia, is among the leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide, accounting for close to a million deaths in children under 5 years of age in 2013 [1]. Viruses and bacteria can be detected in most children with ARI. However, both are also frequently detected in asymptomatic children, and hence, the clinical significance of their detection has long been debated. Furthermore, a wide range of prevalence rates are reported for the detection of viruses and bacteria, most likely due to differences in case definitions, diagnostic tools and methodologies used between studies and hence, the epidemiology and etiology of ARI are still not clear. Viruses and bacteria are often co-detected in respiratory samples from children with ARI and their interaction is likely to play a key role in the development of disease. However, the clinical significance of viral-bacterial co-infections and the mechanisms leading to ARI are not well understood.",

Human rhinovirus (RV) is the leading cause of upper respiratory infections (URI), but is also an important cause of LRI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis, and accounts for the majority of asthma attacks in children [4, 5]. Advances in molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in recent years have led to the identification of new viruses and viral species, and the importance of other viruses is now widely acknowledged. Adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapnuemovirus, coronavirus and bocavirus are among other commonly identified respiratory viruses known to contribute to the burden of childhood ARI.",

However, traditional diagnostic methods such as blood culture, which are still considered the gold standard in most settings, lack sensitivity and hence, the disease burden attributable to specific bacteria is not well understood. The recent advent of sequencing technologies such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing have led to the discovery of far more diverse respiratory microbial communities than previously recognized [8]. However, advanced diagnostics are largely limited to countries with the most resources and studies detecting a comprehensive range of pathogens remain scarce or non-existent. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus are acknowledged as the most common and important bacterial pathogens in childhood ARI, although more recent studies have reported substantial reductions of ARIs due to pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), most likely owing to the widespread introduction of conjugate vaccines [9].",

RSV is a seasonal virus that peaks in the cold season in temperate climates and in the rainy season in tropical climates [15]. It affects about 90% of infants and young children by the age of 2 years, with peak rates occurring in infants 6 weeks to 6 months of age [15]. There are two subtypes of RSV, A and B, which circulate concurrently, although some studies have suggested that RSV-A may be more virulent than RSV-B [16\u201318]. In 2005, there were an estimated 33.8 million new episodes of RSV-associated ARI worldwide in children less than 5 years of age, with at least 3.4 million RSV-associated ARI hospitalizations, and an estimated 66,000\u2013199,000 deaths, 99% of which occurred in developing countries [3]. Hence, RSV is justifiably seen to be the most important cause of childhood ARI and a major cause of ARI-associated hospital admission [3]. Although RSV has been associated with higher rates of hospitalization than other respiratory viruses in several studies, estimates of RSV-associated ARI incidence and hospitalization are highly variable between and within regions, likely due to methodological differences [15].",

Hence, it is frequently referred to as the \u201ccommon cold\u201d virus. However, there is now abundant evidence from experimental and observational studies to support the role of RV as a lower respiratory tract pathogen. Early experiment studies with RV suggested that viral replication was optimal at 33 \u00b0C (91.4 \u00b0F) and was reduced at 37 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F) and 39 \u00b0C (102.2 \u00b0F) [20, 21]. However, more recent studies have shown minimal differences in replication capacities at 33 \u00b0C (91.4 \u00b0F) and 37 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F) for eight different RV strains, including when viruses were cultured and titrated at the same temperature [22]. Hence, RV is now recognised as an important cause of LRI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis and importantly, accounts for the majority of asthma attacks in children [4, 5]. Several studies worldwide have reported RV as the most common virus identified in children with LRI, with identification rates of up to 63% in some populations [23].",

In the first study to estimate the global incidence of influenza-associated ALRI in children less than 5 years of age, there were an estimated 90 million new cases of influenza episodes, 20 million cases of influenza-associated ARI and one million cases of influenza-associated severe ARI causing  28,000\u2013111,500 deaths worldwide in 2008 [36]. In a more recent systematic analysis of the burden of influenza in paediatric respiratory hospitalizations between 1982 and 2012, influenza was associated with an estimated 870,000 hospitalizations in children less than 5 years of age annually [37].",

However, if the influenza co-infection was initiated after the RSV infection, influenza growth was suppressed by RSV [70]. The study also demonstrated suppression of the growth of RSV by influenza A infection at the level of viral protein synthesis [70]. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that a large proportion of infected cells synthesized both RSV and influenza A virus antigens, while scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that influenza A and RSV virions possessing surface antigens specific for each virus were selectively released from dually-infected cells [70].",

Interestingly, the study found that viral growth rate determines which virus will dominate a simultaneous infection [71]. For example, RV, the fastest-growing virus, reduced replication of the remaining viruses during a co-infection, while parainfluenza virus, the slowest-growing virus is suppressed in the presence of other viruses [71]. The authors of the study suggest that the blocking of one virus infection by the presence of another could be explained through resource competition and this finding has been supported by clinical studies of children with ARI [72, 73]. Canducci et al. found that co-infection of RSV and metapneumovirus in infants with ARI was a protective factor for length of hospital stay and hypoxia, when compared with RSV infection alone [72]. Marguet et al. also found shorter length of hospitalization in infants with RSV and RV co-infection comparing with single RSV infection [73].",

One suggestion is that identification of a virus in a respiratory specimen using molecular methods may represent early detection of an infection, asymptomatic carriage, low-virulent infection or prolonged shedding [65]. Therefore, some cases of co-infection may simply be a subject of co-detection. It is also possible that the clinical outcome of viral co-infections is dependent on specific viral combinations, and this may explain the lack of consensus in the literature regarding whether viral co-infections is associated with an increased ARI severity. Many viral co-infection combinations have been reported, as reviewed by Scotta et al., with RSV and RV being the most frequently detected co-infection, although many studies do not even specify the viruses involved in viral co-infections [66].",

S. pneumoniae colonizes the upper respiratory tract and is part of the normal flora of healthy individuals, particularly children. Although there are over 90 different serotypes, most cases of disease are caused by relatively few serotypes, with the ten most common serotypes accounting for 62% of invasive pneumococcal disease [83]. Since its isolation in 1881, there have been great efforts to treat and prevent S. pneumoniae. Antibiotic treatment for invasive pneumococcal infections typically includes broad-spectrum antibiotics until results of antibiotic sensitivity testing are available. However, emerging antibiotic resistance is a growing concern because of its potential negative impact on the outcome of patients who receive standard antibiotic therapy. Pneumococcal vaccines such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are now commonly administered to children globally.",

There are six different H. influenzae capsular serotypes, a through f, in addition to nonencapsulated or nontypeable strains. The two most important human pathogens are the capsular serotype b strains and the nontypeable strains which are nonencapsulated. Non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) live exclusively in the pharynges of humans and are increasingly recognized as pathogens that cause both localized infections of the respiratory tract (middle ear spaces, sinuses, and bronchi) and systemic infections such as bacteremia and pneumonia [86].",

However, when these two species were inoculated in the reverse order, inhibition was observed, indicating competition between both species [94]. Another in-vivo study by Lysenko et al. found that both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae successfully colonized mice when each bacteria species was injected separately [95]. However, when S. pneumoniae was co-colonized with an H. influenzae strain, the density of S. pneumoniae was lower than when inoculated alone, and this was later proved to be fully dependent on complement- and neutrophil-mediated killing of pneumococci [96]. These findings were supported by a large epidemiological study of the 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and prevalence of bacterial colonization in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children in South Africa that reported inverse associations between S. pneumoniae and S. aureus and between S. aureus and H. influenzae in HIV-uninfected children but not HIV-infected children [97].",

These studies suggest that interactions between bacteria are complex and may shift from negative to positive when additional bacteria species are present.",

The clinical significance of viral-bacterial co-infections and mechanisms that drive these interactions are not well understood. It is difficult to determine the relative importance of individual viruses and bacteria involved in co-infections since both viruses and bacteria can be carried commensally in the respiratory tract and their detection may reflect colonization, rather than infection. Furthermore, it is not possible to distinguish between primary and secondary infections in clinical studies, making it difficult to elucidate the interactions between viruses and bacteria in co-infections.",

The most frequently identified organisms in sputum, lung and blood samples of infected patients were S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. aureus, and it was believed that the influenza virus acted synergistically with pathogenic bacteria resulting in increased incidence of disease and death [71]. These findings were supported by data from the 1957 \u201cAsian flu\u201d and 1968 \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d pandemics showing that increased mortality was associated with increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia [72, 73].

H. influenzae and S. aureus were the most common bacteria identified and furthermore, the study reported that children with bacterial co-infection were at increased risk for bacterial pneumonia [107]. In serological study of children with community-acquired pneumonia, 39% of children had viral-bacterial co-infections, of which RSV and S. pneumoniae was the most common combination, accounting for 33% of cases [109]. Like influenza, both RSV and S. pneumoniae infection peaks during the winter months [110] and RSV has also been linked to seasonal increases in S. pneumoniae [111]. In a case-control study by Benet et al., co-infection of RSV and S. pneumoniae was more common in cases than in controls but co-infection of RV and S. pneumoniae was not different between cases and controls [112]. RSV-bacterial co-infection has also been associated with increased disease severity compared with RSV alone including longer hospital stays and more frequent admission to pediatric intensive care unit [108] and longer ventilator support [105, 107]. However, associations identified in clinical studies are often weak and only occasionally reach statistical significance. Additionally, some studies have reported bacterial co-infection rates below 2% in children with RSV [113\u2013116]. In a study of infants hospitalized with RSV, bacterial co-infection was found in only 0.6% of children hospitalized for RSV-associated LRI [116].",

These findings suggest that a significant proportion of hMPV-associated hospitalizations may be prevented by vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Adenovirus co-infection was identified in 21% of children with invasive pneumococcal disease [117]. Some studies have found associations between overall respiratory virus incidence and bacterial incidence, without distinguishing the specific pathogens involved [110].

Among host innate immune responses, alveolar macrophages are the major cell population in the normal airway and form the first line of defence against respiratory pathogens. A deficiency in alveolar macrophage-mediated phagocytosis following influenza has been reported in several studies. Using a murine-model, Ghoneim et al. showed that influenza infection depleted and induced cell death of alveolar macrophages leading to impaired clearance of S. pneumoniae [128]. Influenza and S. pneumoniae co-infection in mice has been also been shown to result in synergistic stimulation of type 1 interferons (IFNs) leading to impaired recruitment of macrophages and subsequently, increased bacterial colonization [129]. Another murine-model study by Jamieson et al. showed that influenza infection resulted in decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines through virus-induced glucocorticoid production, reduced recruitment of innate immune cells to the infection site and consequently, a dramatic increase in bacterial burden [130].",

In an experimental mouse model study, Hament et al. found that S. pneumoniae adherence to epithelial cells was enhanced by a preceding RSV infection [131] and it was later shown through in-vitro and in-vivo studies that RSV was capable of direct binding to S. pneumoniae [132]. Similarly, Avadhanula et al. showed that respiratory viruses including RSV, HPIV, and influenza virus enhanced adhesion of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae to primary immortalized cell lines but only RSV and HPIV increased receptor expression for bacteria by primary bronchial epithelial cells and A549 cells [133]. Other studies have shown that RSV virions can bind directly to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae acting as a direct coupling particle between bacteria and epithelial cells and thereby increasing colonization by, and enhancing, invasiveness of bacteria [124, 134]. There is also evidence that during RSV infection, viral glycoproteins at the host cell surface, act as additional receptions for bacteria adherence [132, 134]. Respiratory viruses can also increase expression of host surface proteins to which bacteria can bind [133, 135, 136]. Host cell receptors for bacterial adherence have also been found to be exposed by viral neuraminidase activities in studies of influenza virus and S. pneumoniae [137, 138]. There is also evidence that viral-mediated epithelia damage can lead to exposure of the basement membrane and additional receptors for bacterial adherence [139, 140].",

While S. pneumoniae carriage rates are approximately 4% in adults, carriage rates are over 50% in children [142] and up to 80% in children under 5 in developing countries [143]. This supports growing evidence that bacterial infections may promote secondary viral infections, rather than vice versa. In a large, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in infants in South Africa, the 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was shown to prevent 31% of pneumonias associated with respiratory viruses in children in hospital, leading to the suggestion that viruses contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia [144]. In another study of healthy children under 2 years of age, Verkaik et al. found that higher seroconversion rates to hMPV were associated with increased nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae [145]. Furthermore, well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells pre-incubated in-vitro with S. pneumoniae resulted in increased susceptibility to infection with HMPV-enhanced green fluorescent protein, suggesting that S. pneumoniae can modulate HMPV infection [145].",

In contrast, in another mouse model study by McCullers et al., influenza infection preceding a pneumococcal challenge primed for pneumonia led to 100% mortality [147].

Complex synergistic and antagonistic interactions between viruses and bacteria most likely play a key role in the development of ARI. Viruses and bacteria of the respiratory microbiome may each influence the pathogenicity and consecutive development of infections of the other. Improving knowledge of the interactions between viruses and bacteria may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of ARI and eventually to new prevention and treatment strategies.",
