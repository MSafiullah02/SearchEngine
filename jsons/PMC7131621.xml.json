            "text": "The threat of infectious disease spread in a population, either through natural or deliberate introduction, requires that governments plan their strategies to deal with these threats to protect their nation's health. This includes plans to manufacture and stockpile medical countermeasures, such as antibiotics and vaccines. Vaccines are a key defence against infectious diseases, but industry will only manufacture vaccines against a commercial interest and has little incentive to develop vaccines on a speculative basis against a threat that may not materialise. Two parliamentary committees in the UK have identified a need for a manufacturing facility that can respond rapidly to produce vaccines against infectious diseases that pose a threat to the UK [1], [2]. This paper outlines a proposal to meet this need. A Strategic Vaccine Facility (SVF) would provide the opportunity to develop production processes for a variety of experimental vaccines. These could then be tested in clinical trials and passed onto industry for production if indicated. Even if there was no immediate demand for the product, as for a vaccine against a new influenza strain, it could still be developed to a point allowing rapid production by industry in times of need, e.g., by preparing Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) seed banks. This would provide a strategic capability for coping with infectious diseases as a significant part of the UK preparedness plan. This paper sets out the concept for a Strategic Vaccine Facility to enhance the UK's capability to deal with new and emerging diseases.",

We do not know when and where the next serious disease epidemic will arise and what the nature of that epidemic will be. Another notorious feature of some pathogens is their ability to spread over large areas in relatively little time. This has been further fuelled with the increase in international travel. Diseases that a few years ago would have been confined to a small, remote area can now rapidly spread world-wide in a short time span. Changes in environmental conditions, such as global warming, clearing of forestation for agriculture and widespread damming in arid regions are also factors in the emergence of disease.",

Owing to constantly changing ecological and social factors, it is impossible to predict when and where the next emergence of a pathogen of importance to human health will be. Pathogens can disappear from niches, as well as emerge. Malaria was endemic in the UK until the 1920s when marsh drainage wiped out the main local mosquito vector (Anopheles atroparvus) from the UK [3]. It is a possibility that this mosquito will again find a niche in the UK and malaria will once again become endemic. Indeed, there are a number of reported \u201cairport\u201d malaria cases in the UK, where people living near to airports with incoming flights from malaria endemic zones are infected without having been abroad [4].",

There are over 100 cases of imported dengue virus infections into the UK each year (Dr. G. Lloyd, personal communication) and several imported cases of Lassa fever in European countries have been recorded [5]. There is the potential for these organisms to establish in a new country after importation, especially if the vector, such as mosquito species capable of transmitting infection, is present. The West Nile Virus (WNV) epidemic in the US began with the importation of virus into New York, which quickly established itself in the local mosquito population [6] and thence spread to most states in just a few years. The route of importation of the virus has not yet been established. SARS became an international problem due to rapid spread of this novel coronavirus from China to other countries through air travel by infected passengers.",

The ultimate result was a virus that was capable of very efficient human-to-human spread and to which the population of the time had very little pre-existing immunity. The disease spread across the world in a matter of months, killing over 20 million people. Two further, less severe, influenza pandemics also arose last century. These were the 1957 Asian Flu (H2N2) and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu (H3N2). Again, these pandemics were caused by strains thought to have arisen by genetic re-assortment between avian and human influenza viruses. Recent years have seen the emergence of an increasing number of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1 and H7N7, which have the capacity to infect humans [7], [8]. None of these recent outbreaks has resulted in widespread human-to-human transmission, but the emergence of a strain of influenza with this capability may be just a matter of time.",

Recent advances in vaccine manufacture and increased understanding of immunology and pathogen\u2013host interactions have expanded the repertoire of approaches that can be made to produce vaccines against individual diseases. For some diseases, vaccines are easily produced by inactivating the pathogen. An example is influenza vaccine. Vaccines against other diseases may be more difficult to produce. Vaccines against HIV still elude us, despite nearly 20 years of work by many research groups in many countries. For some emerging diseases, it would be possible to produce a vaccine based on the track record of vaccines against related strains. Other vaccine programmes may need a more sophisticated approach, with production of attenuated, sub-unit or genetically modified vector vaccines. Sophisticated vaccine development generally requires major investment and takes many years to complete.",

In many cases, vaccine development and manufacture has been overlooked by large pharmaceutical companies, since the high cost of developing vaccines against these diseases is not an attractive economic proposition. Such vaccine development, therefore, relies on research grants from public bodies and relief organisations, and the small research groups that take on this work do not have the necessary funding or facilities to manufacture their vaccine candidates themselves, particularly to the quality standards demanded for use in human clinical trials. Other diseases, such as HIV and malaria have so far evaded effective vaccine development due to their complex structures and interactions with their hosts.",

The ability to study immune responses in man and animals, and to provide satisfactory animal models are also key to new vaccine design, production and evaluation. The ability to work within the strictest mode of biological containment is critical to the operation of any proposed facility. Undertaking regular operations in the facility ensures that operators remain fully trained and have the requisite experience required to develop products under emergency situations.
