The pandemic has resulted in an evolution of healthcare rhetoric. From a healthcare policy perspective, we have been discussing 'the patient voice' in a passive manner. An important lesson from the COVID-19 experience is that we must now shift to a more comprehensive understanding of 'patient actions'.",
