            "text": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) is one of the world\u2019s leading humanitarian medical organizations. It provides emergency medical assistance to populations in danger in more than 70 countries. The foundational and animating values of MSF as a humanitarian medical organization are rooted in ethics [1]. Historically, research was not seen as core to the mission of MSF. However, during its history, MSF has constantly developed innovative protocols and tools, in response to unmet field needs [2]. It now initiates, sponsors or participates in numerous research projects in multiple field sites. In 2013 alone, 253 research papers were published [3]. The results of MSF research have had substantial impact on global health policy and provide benefits to populations served by MSF and elsewhere as presented later in this paper. MSF has also shown leadership in operational research initiatives in the humanitarian NGO sector [4]. As a result, research has become increasingly integral to MSF activities, both in the field and in global health advocacy. The increased emphasis on research led to the creation of an ethics review board (ERB) in 2001. From the outset independence of the ERB from the organisation was perceived as essential. To avoid conflict of interest and ensure independence, ERB members cannot have a working relationship with MSF during their tenure. The ERB has now been in place for thirteen years. The ERB\u2019s dialogue with MSF has enhanced sensitivities towards research ethics and lead to gradual improvements in developing ethically sound proposals. The consistent use of an ethics framework has helped in standardizing the review process and guiding field research teams in addressing ethical issues. The way that the ERB functions and the challenging ethical issues addressed by the ERB since its inception have been described previously [5]. The ERB strives to take a constructive approach to both research proposals and the field of research ethics itself. The ERB has encouraged innovation in both the review of proposals and the interaction between the ERB and the organization.",

Some of the innovations implemented by the ERB may run counter to standard operating procedures and guidance documents that are utilized in various jurisdictions. We argue that much standard practice in research ethics review ought to be open to challenge and revision, and this irrespectively of the actors and the context of the research. Research ethics is a field that should not be regarded as a set of rigid standards fixed for all time and in all contexts. Much of current research ethics practice lacks an empirical basis, and many recommended standards are based on historical practice. From our perspective, research ethics and research ethics practices are capable of being examined through research and a quality improvement approach. Any genuine ethics review requires critical reflection and discussion, not the pedestrian adoption of legalistic rules, and it should result in a learning process for both the researchers and the reviewers. Fostering a spirit of innovation and evaluation in research ethics practice demonstrates that research ethics itself is an active and essential component of global health research. In this paper we describe innovations that we think challenge accepted practices and thus hope to stimulate a more vigorous debate in this area, beyond the realm of research carried out by MSF.",

Since its inception, the volume of ERB activity has increased considerably, as reflected in the number of protocols received. Overall 248 research protocols were reviewed by the ERB between 2002 and 2013 with an almost ten-fold increase in the number of protocols across that period (Figure 2). Protocols are always submitted to the ERB and to the Ethics Committees in the study country, and the approval from the local Ethics Committee is a fundamental prerequisite to the ERB approval. In very rare instances, the ERB may waive this request if, for example, no ethics committee or national body able to play a similar function is available, or if it is justified not to collaborate with the legal authorities, as this could be detrimental to the population served by MSF (e.g. working in a conflict zone with a population group persecuted by national authorities).",

However, the ERB is faster than the investigators in case of full review. Once a satisfactory reply and revisions from the researchers are received, approval is usually granted quickly. Overall the procedure is faster for expedited review than for full review. This is mainly due to the fact that proposals submitted for expedited review are judged to be of minimal risk of harm, that study design is often less complex and that a smaller number of reviewers is involved. Assessing the timeline of the review procedure is a relevant indicator of ERB performance and dispels the myth that the ERB is responsible for a slow review process. Also, the overall time to approval should not be seen as the \u201ctime to getting a stamp\u201d, but as a time of dialogue and critical reflection on both sides. In addition, ERB timelines are shortened in case of extraordinarily urgent situations and turnaround can occur within a few days.",

First, it seeks to articulate and make explicit the kinds of values or other ethical considerations that are taken to be of crucial importance in relation to the topic in hand, in this case, the ethics of research conducted in the course of humanitarian medicine. Any framework will be the product of a particular time, influenced by the knowledge and experience of those involved in producing it. Articulating the considerations that are held to be relevant allows for transparent discussion, critique and development of the framework over time in the light of evolving situations. Second, and perhaps most crucially, an ethics framework provides assistance to researchers and others that evaluate and/or make decisions about the ethics of research. This means that a framework will often be an aid to research design and deliberation, not just a theoretical expression of ideals. On this view, it ought to be of use to members of the ethics board, but also of aid to researchers and anyone else thinking about the relevant issues (as the document is publicly available on the MSF website [7]). Third, it is also important to recognise what a framework does not do. It does not, for example, determine what should or should not be done. It is not a piece of legal or quasi-legal regulation. Rather, its intent is clearly expressed by the metaphor of \u2018framing\u2019; it aims to \u2018frame\u2019, or provide an outline or structure for a focused and relevant discussion and eventual decision, not to provide a list of necessary and absolute principles or statements.",

The Emanuel framework seemed to synthesize these diverse guidelines into something tangible. Despite its limitations briefly described below, it provided a focus for both reviewers and researchers.

            "text": "There were three main motivations for developing a new framework. First, and perhaps most importantly, the Emanuel framework actually provides little practical guidance. It is more of a checklist of important considerations than a framework that facilitates making ethical judgments. For example, the framework is structured in terms of a series of ethical \u2018principles\u2019 and related \u2018benchmarks\u2019. However, it is unclear what a benchmark is. How do the different \u2018benchmarks\u2019 relate to each other? What is the moral status of a benchmark? Is it an ethical principle, a value or just a statement? What practical priority is to be given to each principle or benchmark? How do the different principles and benchmarks relate to each other and what should we do if they conflict? Is the presented order of the principles and benchmarks important or not? For example, the old framework\u2019s first stated \u2018principle\u2019 is \u2018Collaborative Partnership\u2019, followed by \u2018Social Value\u2019 and then \u2018Scientific Validity\u2019. In what sense are these supposed to be principles? They might be things that researchers and the ERB are supposed to \u2018take into account\u2019, but how do they do this? Is \u201cCollaborative Partnership\u201d the most important \u2018principle\u2019? Is that why it is first? Emanuel et al. [8] suggest that their requirements are presented in chronological order, although the detail of the order could be questioned. For example, why is a procedural requirement (independent review) in the list, and why does it appear where it does? Why is informed consent prior to, and separate from, respect for potential and enrolled subjects? If we consider the \u2018benchmarks\u2019 the first thing that is noticeable is that they are very didactic (Table 1).",

There is a mixture of useful advice about engaging with local communities and researchers, although it remains unclear why this should be done.

If so, it is unclear what they might be, especially as \u2018collaborative partnership\u2019 is not an ethical principle. For example, you might expect some possible commitment to ideas of respect, or equality and justice. Second, the benchmarks are not always helpful. For example, consider the benchmark: \u2018Respect the community\u2019s values, culture, traditions, and social practices\u2019. What does this mean? Does this relate to the kinds of issues just mentioned, such as a commitment to equal respect and value of persons? Are we to take it literally as a general didactic statement? Is it a commitment to some form of relativism? Are we to commit ourselves to engage with and effectively endorse any existing injustices in the population of study? If women have a marginalised role in that society, should we \u2018respect\u2019 this? At the very least, these are complex matters where the benchmarks often fail to capture the nuances relevant to thinking about ethics. Similar kinds of questions can be asked of many other research ethics frameworks and guidelines, as it is often left obscure how they are to be used as practical tools [11,12].",

MSF as a medical organisation is providing health care to vulnerable and destitute populations and is devoting limited resources to research with the sole aim of improving health care. Third, there has been a growing awareness that the kind of research conducted by MSF may not be well served by traditional research ethics for several reasons: the chosen method is only rarely one of a randomised clinical trial of novel medicines (the model that has dominated research ethics) and is more likely to use retrospective analysis of previously collected clinical data, surveys, needs assessment or case control methods; the context for research is distinctive, in that much research is conducted in contexts of disaster, conflict, poverty, social exclusion and lack of access to care, disrupted health systems or other difficult circumstances, where there is great vulnerability and pressing humanitarian needs.",

Formulating the content of the framework in terms of questions very deliberately \u2018frames\u2019 the discussion about research ethics.

The new framework covers much of the same ground, but approaches the issues in a different spirit. It seeks to invite researchers to justify their approach. It accepts that sometimes it is inappropriate or impossible to gain a fully informed consent from every individual. Help is offered to the researcher, but the aim is to encourage a conversation about ethical issues, rather than impose quasi-legalistic rules. The questions help potential researchers to see what the ERB wishes to see in a protocol and ethics application, but can also help researchers come to understand ethical issues in more detail, and how ethical issues are intertwined with methodological issues. The use of open questions requires researchers to engage with the framework and outline and defend how they will address the relevant issues that they have identified. Ethics review is more of an active process, with the researcher as a participant, rather than the victim of an alien and abstract set of rules. Third, the new framework is more engaged with the specific MSF research context. This means that certain values/principles/issues are given much greater prominence than they ever have before. For example, it is now much clearer how methodological and ethical issues interact and the obligations that arise once research has been completed are much more prominent and require greater attentionb.",

At a later stage these data may be useful to evaluate programme outcomes, analyse predictors of treatment outcomes, or assess factors influencing programme or treatment effectiveness. As the number of protocols aimed at generating this kind of data submitted to the ERB for review was steadily increasing, the possibility of delegating ethical responsibility for this type of study to the MSF medical directors under certain conditions was discussed at a joint meeting of the ERB and medical directors in June 2010. Primary considerations concerned (1) how these data were collected and (2) how patients were informed of the potential uses of their health data. Collecting routine clinical data should presumably follow universal ethical principles and thus might be thought to require consent. The ERB thus encouraged MSF to establish a policy on routine collection of data in clinical settings. The uses of such data may carry a low risk of harm, informing each patient may be difficult to implement and it is arguable that consent to at least some uses is implicit in clinical care. It was thus suggested that MSF consider a variety of ways of informing people about the possible uses of their data (e.g. well displayed posters describing the potential uses of health data collected in the clinic).",

As MSF wished to carry out research on supportive treatments in major outbreak settings, the ERB suggested in 2010 a \u201cgeneric\u201d protocol be prepared, taking into consideration how to involve potential victims (or survivors) of these outbreaks in the development of such protocols.

However, some survivors are health workers and it may be possible to involve them in protocol development. In this specific case the \u201cgeneric\u201d research protocol could also be pre-approved by the relevant ethics committees of the countries concerned such as DRC, Republic of Congo, Gabon, South Sudan, and Uganda. This had not been taken forward by MSF before the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. ERB members, MSF medical directors and researchers met in October 2014, and subsequent decisions to conduct clinical trials in the Ebola outbreak were informed by the interaction of the ERB and MSF.

Although these could be considered low-risk surveys, the same survey may be more sensitive in certain populations, such as a mortality survey in Iraq or in Syrian refugees, mapping of water quality in slums during the cholera epidemic in Haiti or assessing access to health services for undocumented migrants. Surveys cannot be presumed upfront to be of minimal risk. Many sensitive and morally problematic issues can be disclosed by surveys.

Of the remaining 105 studies, 76 lead to one or several publications, 9 to a more limited dissemination of results (i.e. poster or oral presentations), while the results of 20 studies were only shared internally through a report.",

Given the fact that MSF research spans from opportunistic analyses of collected data to clinical trials, these categories do not necessarily imply a hierarchy. Some studies may be designed for local impact only; others may from the outset have the ambition to change therapeutic protocols internationally [21]. In Figure 4 below, each subsequent category encompasses the previous one. For example, impact at national level includes impact at the local level, and impact at a global scale comprises impact on MSF operations. Table 3 provides some examples for each of the four impact categories [22-30].",

Impact reporting has been systematised on an annual basis for all research protocols approved by the ERB. It is important to note that this approach to impact does not just follow orthodox approaches such as, for example, citation counts. The ERB has also encouraged MSF to share negative findings arising from MSF research as well as positive findings. However, this has not been explicitly assessed.",

First and foremost, we have noted over the years the importance of the dialogue between MSF researchers and independent ERB members. Continued interaction has allowed for progressive innovations based on a trustful and respectful partnership between the ERB and the researchers. During those years we have learned to work together and to better serve each other\u2019s needs thus leading to a co-evolution of researchers and the research ethics board. And most importantly we have come to understand that research ethics should be seen as an iterative evolving process. Our experience shows that ethics review can be a constructive learning process, and a time of reflection and critical debate. We think research ethics review should take this format. This, of course, differs from the ordinary perception of institutional ethics review as legalistic, formulaic and at times obstructive.",
