Numerical simulations show that the evolving dynamics of the network is effectively captured by a single scalar function of time, regardless of the distribution of \u03b2 in the population. The continuum limit of the network model allows a simple derivation of the simpler model, which is a single scalar delay differential equation (DDE), wherein the variation in \u03b2 appears through an integral closely related to the moment generating function of u = \u221a \u03b2. If the first few moments of u exist, the governing DDE can be expanded in a series that shows a direct correspondence with the original compartmental DDE with a single \u03b2. Even otherwise, the new scalar DDE can be solved using either numerical integration over u at each time step, or with the analytical integral if available in some useful form. Our work provides a new academic example of complete dimensional collapse, ties up an underlying continuum model for a pandemic with a simpler-seeming compartmental model, and will hopefully lead to new analysis of continuum models for epidemics.",

Pandemics can be studied using simple mean-field models or compartmental models, where the entire population is divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), quarantined (Q), and recovered (R) groups. More groups like hospitalized (H), vaccinated (V), etc., can be added, or groups can be removed, depending on modeling goals. These models are primarily developed based on the original SIR model due to Kermack and McKendrick [18] . Many models include other complexities like prior immunity, temporary immunity transferred at birth, vaccination history, a carrier population that never recovers [14] , reinfection due to loss of immunity after recovery [6] , exposed but asymptomatic populations [13] , a quarantined population [9] , and the influence of vital dynamics [12] .",

Others have less exposure than average (e.g., older people, people who cooperate more with recommended social distancing measures). Some have strong immune systems, and others have weak immune systems, which might be reflected in differing values of the underlying parameter\u03b2 in Eq. (1). All these people interact to various degrees in modern society, where travel and mixing are common. The details of this variation, if incorporated, will yield a richer model that can hopefully make more realistic predictions. We clarify that we do not stratify the population by age, occupation, health status, or social behavior. In our model, all these factors contribute to a final effective \u03b2 for each person.

Under a simple separable interaction model for different \u03b2's, and upon neglecting loss of immunity for those who have recovered from the disease, the continuum model reduces to two nonlinear integrodifferential equations with delays, with the continuously variable \u03b2 appearing as a parameter. However, due to a remarkable dimensional collapse, the dynamics is exactly described by a single scalar nonlinear delay differential equation without integrals, where the parameter \u03b2 appears only through the first derivative of its moment generating function. If some required moments of the distribution are finite, then a local expansion can be easily computed for small levels of overall infection, and the correpondence with the lumped model of [28, 27] is transparent and close. If the moments are unbounded, alternative, slightly more complex, single DDE approximations can still be developed, at least in principle. In this way, both the justification for the lumped model, as well as corrections needed for variable \u03b2, are exactly demonstrated. From a practical viewpoint, our results clarify the role of, e.g., higher versus lower variability of \u03b2 in the population in the spread, saturation, and containment of the disease. From an academic viewpoint, our work presents a new and satisfying example of extreme model order 2 reduction.",

When \u03b2 varies within the population, we use a network model. Figure 2 illustrates the idea. Here the total population is partitioned into N sub groups P 1 ,P 2 ,...,P N ; and each group is modeled with different \u03b2 k ranging from \u03b2 1 to \u03b2 N . The primary consequence is that in the network's equivalent of Eq. 2 for group k, the I(t) must be replaced by something that represents interaction effects from all groups. We will model this using a quantity \u039b(t) that applies to the entire network, as explained below.

This assumption is motivated by the idea that, in a well-functioning society, the degree of mixing practiced by individuals varies a lot more than the time taken for an infected person to be detected and quarantined; and that the rate of self-recovery \u03b3 is a biological quantity indpendent of an individual's social behavior.

The distribution of initial values for\u00ce(\u03b2) usesV (\u03b2) that is random, initially uniformly distributed between 1 and 2, and then normalized to unit 1-norm. Also shown is the fit\u015c(\u03b2, t) = S(\u03b2, \u2212\u03bd)e \u2212f (t) \u221a \u03b2 at different instants of time. These results demonstrate that provided the intial infected population distribution is small, the subsequent evolution obeys a simple one-dimensional description with a scalar variable f (t). 9 has greater social mixing, i.e., S(\u03b2, 0) that decays slowly with increasing \u03b2, may see an outbreak of the infection. A point to note during numerical solution of Eqs. (20) and (21) is that S(\u03b2, t) and I(\u03b2, t) are nonnegative. It is in principle possible for I(\u03b2, t) to start positive and become exactly zero at some instant (based on hypothetical initial functions used in the delayed variables), and it corresponds to all infected people becoming quarantined before fresh people are infected. However, such a situation corresponds to the pandemic being quenched by eliminating infection, and is not of interest when either infection cannot be eliminated, or when even elimination of infection leaves the system unstable (i.e., introduction of infinitesimal infection leads to an outbreak). As seen in the numerical solutions of Figs 3 and 4 , there are clearly also other solutions of interest where the pandemic progresses, infects a percentage of the population, and reaches an eventual equilibrium with the infection not progressing further. For such solutions, the nonnegativity constraint of S(\u03b2, t) and I(\u03b2, t) turns out to be satisfied. 33) is taken as f (t) = \u03c9 \u00d7 (1 + t \u03bd ), with \u03c9 is adjusted to match the results from (Eqs (15) and (16)).

We have considered a simple interaction model between susceptible individuals with different infectivity parameters \u03b2 k and \u03b2 r , and examined the case where the effective interaction parameter between these groups is monotonic in each parameter, symmetric, and separable. Under reasonable qualitative requirements, we settled on an interaction term of the form \u221a \u03b2 k \u03b2 r . With this interaction, the continuum limit of the network model yielded a pair of delayed integrodifferential equations parameterized by \u03b2. However, numerical solutions also suggested a remarkable dimensional collapse in the underlying dynamics, such that the entire variation due to the continuously distributed \u03b2 could be captured using a single function of time. The dynamics in terms of this function, f (t), turned out to be given by a single first order nonlinear DDE. We have referred to this dramatic simplification as complete dimensional collapse.",

For example, in the finitemoments case, even if \u03b2 is distributed such that a small proportion of the population has rather high \u03b2 values, there is no immediate catastrophic growth because that subpopulation, being small, tends to interact mostly with other parts of the population whose \u03b2 values are smaller. Even in a population where some people engage in behavior corresponding to high \u03b2 (i.e., not obeying social distancing), low-\u03b2 behavior from other members of the population can help to both limit the pandemic and provide differential benefits based on adopted risk levels. Satisfyingly, the criterion for unstable growth from small initial infection is governed solely by the population average of \u03b2, although the final saturation value of the infection depends on higher moments. In particular, for a small outbreak due to weak instability under infinitesimal initiation, the saturation value is essentially determined by the population averages of \u03b2 and \u03b2 3/2 , or of u 2 and u 3 respectively.",
