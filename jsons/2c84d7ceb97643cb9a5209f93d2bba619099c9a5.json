In a desperate attempt to contain the further spread of the virus and the diffusion of the COVID-19 disease it causes, governments across the world have taken measures that are unprecedented. Entire cities, regions and countries are sealed off, travel is banned, schools and universities are closed, shops are running out of stocks, and all economic, cultural and social activities have come to a stop. Never before in modern history has a health problem had such an overwhelming impact on society. Health (or rather the threat of ill health) has become the prevailing concern that takes precedence over all others issues, making health in all policies become a reality, albeit not in the way it was intended.",

When all hands are called on deck to prevent a contagious virus from spreading and to reinforce hospital staff facing a tsunami of patients suffering from a potentially deadly disease, there seems to be little need for specialists whose expertise lies at the other end of the continuum of care spectrum (Springer and Phillips, 2006) . The real war heroes in the battle against the CoV-2 virus are virologists, epidemiologists, doctors and nurses, and even if many of the actions taken serve a preventative purpose, their focus is on the prevention of disease, not on promoting health.",

Hand washing, wearing face masks and protective gloves and 'social distancing' (which should really be termed 'spatial distancing') are all forms of human behaviour. As the expertise with regard to health behaviour change is one of the core competencies of health educators and promoters, their advice may help governments to achieve the required behaviour change. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, the rapid and continuous evolution of the COVID-19 problem and the scale of the measures that are put in place may, rightly or wrongly, create the perception that the existing health system is failing to protect citizens against the spread of the virus. This creates a need for people to regain control of their health, to protect oneself against the disease and to deal with its disruptive consequences.",

With respect to COVID-19, there is an abundance of information available, with official and unofficial websites continuously updating recommendations and instructions, and news media covering the situation around the clock. The question is, however, whether all this information is useful. A bombardment of communication, although well intended, can create confusion. Therefore, coordination of key messaging between the health sector and other sectors is necessary in pandemic responses (Smith and Judd, 2020) Moreover, for information to be helpful it must not only be available, but also understood, accepted and applied. Research on health literacy has shown that more than a third of the population worldwide has difficulties in finding, understanding, evaluating and using information that is necessary to manage their health (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2015; Duong et al., 2017) . Authorities should take that into account when informing the public about COVID-19 and adapt the information to the literacy needs of the people they want to reach. That means the response to the pandemic should be looked at through an equity lens (Smith and Judd, 2020) , with attention for those who are the most vulnerable in pandemics, such as elderly, migrants or people with disabilities.

To inform themselves about the virus and ways to protect themselves, people actively select information sources and information from within these sources, some of which may be contradictory. Information processing theory teaches us that this selection is influenced by context, emotions and selective attention (Estes, 2014) , thus introducing a potential selection bias whereby more attention is paid to some information than to other. The use of cognitive schemes to process this information adds another form of bias, namely confirmation bias (i.e. the tendency to seek information that confirms the beliefs already held and to ignore or discard information that contradicts these beliefs). Likewise, the activation of cognitive schemes to filter, classify and assimilate information and make connections with already available knowledge that takes place when trying to understand and appraise the information about the virus and to judge the importance of preventive measures can again cause a series of biases. In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the most important ones are possibly negative information bias (i.e. the tendency to attach more importance to negative than to positive information, resulting in \u00ab catastrophic thinking \u00bb), positive information bias (i.e. the tendency to consider oneself as less at risk for negative consequence, causing \u00ab unrealistic optimism \u00bb), and familiarity or recency bias (i.e. things that are familiar or recent are more easily retrieved from memory and therefore more easily considered as \u00ab true \u00bb).",

In its effort to move away from a strongly diseaseoriented approach to public health, health promotion has traditionally focused on non-communicable disease, where it has significantly contributed to the progress made in areas like tobacco and obesity prevention. But with the exception of HIV/AIDS, the application of health promotion principles and methods to tackle infectious diseases has been largely neglected. As a result, public health professionals who deal with communicable diseases are often unaware of the approaches used by health promoters (ECDC, 2014) , although there is a good reason to assume that these can be usefully adapted and applied to preventing infectious diseases as well. That would require, however, that health promotion researchers and practitioners develop a keen interest in infectious diseases. McQueen (2015) argues that to further the cause of health promotion applied to both infectious and non-communicable disease, health promotion needs to focus more on intervention research and understand the processes involved in implementation, rather than on outcomes and causality. As interventions are dynamic and subject to change during implementation, participatory methods should be further developed, recognized and documented in the scientific literature and in research protocols.",

There is a general consensus that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is of animal origin, jumped species boundaries to infect humans either before or after it evolved to its current pathogenic state (Andersen et al., 2020) , and could then very rapidly spread in a globalized economic system characterized by high levels of interconnectedness and mobility. Health promotion has never paid much attention to zoonotic causes of human health, but the current crisis suggests that maybe it should. A good starting point would be to embrace the concept of 'One Health', which recognizes the interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment, with the goal to achieve optimal health outcomes (Atlas et al., 2010; Calistri et al., 2013) . After all, the collaborative, multisectoral and transdisciplinary nature of the One Health approach is very much akin to health promotion's principles and strategies. It also links very well with the growing interest of health promotion researchers and practitioners for sustainable development, as exemplified by recent projects (e.g. INHERIT; https://www.in herit.eu) and by the choice of 'planetary health and sustainable development' as the theme for the latest IUHPE World Conference on Health Promotion (Ratima, 2019) .",

To deal with an epidemic effectively, we must not only understand viruses and how they spread, but also the ways in which people make decisions, organizations operate and communities relate in reaction to them (Kickbusch and Sakellarides, 2006) . Health promotion researchers should learn from crisis situations, analyse the reactions and document the learnings. A good example is the way the Singaporean government dealt with the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was shown that, rather than the actual knowledge about the virus, the high confidence and trust in the government's ability to cope with SARS was a key factor in controlling the crisis (Deurenberg-Yap et al., 2005) . This confirms findings from other studies highlighting the importance of trust in dealing with crisis situations (Siegrist and Zingg, 2014) . In a similar vein, a comparison between the response to Hurricane Katarina in New Orleans and to SARS in Toronto put the success of the Toronto response down to social cohesion (Matthews, 2006, cited by Kickbusch and Sakellarides, 2006) . These and other findings call for further research on the ways trust in public institutions can be enhanced and social capital can be mobilized in order to make populations more resilient against crises.",
