Its rapid spread throughout the American continent in 2016 and its potential to cause congenital abnormalities in infants have raised serious concerns. This led to the World Health Organization declaring the ZIKV infection as a global health emergency on February 1, 2016.[5]",

Environmental control measures include the identification and elimination of the potential breeding sites of water stagnation.[35]",

However, the recent reports from Bangladesh are alarming where the first case of ZIKV infection in a 67-year-old male has been detected.[38] The problem of ZIKV could become really grave in Asian countries due to warm and humid conditions which are ideal for the mosquito vector breeding.[37] In these resources-strained countries where the per capita income is low and there is a meagre contribution from the government's annual health budget, the emergence of ZIKV could only add to the woes.[394041] Moreover, in the absence of clear guidelines, management strategies, and cure, the proper dissemination of the healthcare information about the ZIKV is imperative, and thus the role of all the stakeholders, including clinicians, healthcare workers, the general public, government agencies, NGO's such as the HIFA2015 is very important.[424344]",
