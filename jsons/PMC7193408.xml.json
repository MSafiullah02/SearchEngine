Unfortunately, despite many efforts made toward its diagnosis and treatment, the development of a drug treatment for ARDS remains challenging. To pursue the precise care of patients with ARDS, a better understanding of the mechanisms and accurate methods to prognosticate ARDS are required. To date, hundreds of biomarkers have been explored but very few of them have been able to successfully guide the diagnose and treatment of ARDS.",

Previous studies have performed metabolomic analysis of plasma, pulmonary edema fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in ARDS patients, preliminarily results revealed a broad range of metabolites that could help in diagnosis and stratify ARDS [3\u20136]. However, it is still unknown whether there exist any specific metabolites that not only help in identifying different phenotypes of ARDS but also have a crucial function in the disease process. ARDS is characterized by dysregulated immune response and diffused alveolar damage. It is well reported that some metabolites are capable of inducing inflammation and regulating the activation of immune cells [7, 8]. Kentaro Tojo et al. have revealed that the enhancement of glycolysis attenuated the lung tissue injury by protecting alveolar epithelial cells from decline in energy [9]. Their results also indicated that metabolites played an important role in ARDS.",

See Supplementary Table S1 for the abundance and distribution of these metabolites in plasma samples from patients and healthy volunteers. The differential metabolomic profiles between the ARDS patients and the healthy controls, and between the survivors and the non-survivors from the patient pool were obtained via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). These score plots displayed a significant separation between ARDS patients and healthy controls (Fig. 1a). Cross validation showed that five components were optimal to build the model, based on which we calculated the related statistics (Fig. 1c). The R2 was (0.96) for the validity of PLS-DA model against over-fitting and the predictive ability was described by Q2 (0.87). The permutation test (n = 2000) with a P value less than 0.05 indicated toward good predictive ability of PLS-DA models (Figure S1). Statistically significant separation of metabolomic profiles was also observed between the survivors and non-survivors of ARDS (Fig. 1b), and PLS-DA served as a valid model for discriminating the metabolites (R2 = 0.89, Q2 = 0.49) (Fig. 1d).\n",

The higher VIP scores of the metabolites had, the more important contribution of it in the differences between groups. A VIP plot generated from the PLS-DA models ranked individual metabolites for their power to discriminate ARDS from controls (Fig. 2a). It can be seen that phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0/0:0), isoleucine, D-phenylalnaine and L-Gulose in the plasma were mainly contributed to the metabolic differences between ARDS patients and healthy controls (VIP > 3.0). The differences in the metabolic profiles of the survivors and the non-survivors of ARDS patients are shown in Fig. 2b. They were mainly attributed to D-Phenylalanine, myristic acid and oleic acid in the plasma (VIP > 3.0). The heatmap shows the abundance of top 30 metabolites in all individuals based on VIP scores. We found several glycerophospholipids like 1-Linoleoylglycerophosphocholine, PC(16,0/0:0), Phosphatidylcholine lyso18:2, and LysoPC20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z) that were significantly downregulated in the ARDS patients compared to the healthy controls (Fig. 2c).

To preliminary screen the differential metabolites, we selected the metabolites that had a P value less than 0.05 (calculated by Student\u2019s t-test) and a VIP score greater than 1.0 (calculated using PLS-DA model). The differential metabolites between ARDS patients and healthy controls are displayed in Table 2. Similarly, the metabolites that were found to distinguish the non-survivors from the survivors of ARDS are shown in Table 3. Among all those selected compounds, Phenylalanine, D-Phenylalanine, Phenylacetylglutamine and a short peptide (Gly Pro Gly Lys) were identified in both groups (ARDS vs healthy controls and survivors vs non-survivors) (Fig. 3a). As Phenylalanine, D-Phenylalanine and Phenylacetylglutamine are all involved in the Phenylalanine metabolism, we focused on these three metabolites. The box whisker plots showed that all of three compounds had significant higher concentration in the non-survivors compared to the survivors (Fig. 3b-d). Phenylalanine and D-Phenylalanine had higher levels in the ARDS patients compared to the healthy controls (Fig. 3b-c). We also compared these metabolites in ARDS patients with different severity (mild moderate and severe) according to Berlin\u2019s definition. The levels of Phenylacetylglutamine were markedly lower in moderate ARDS patients compared to severe ARDS patients (Figure S2). There was no significant difference among the concentration of Phenylalanine and D-Phenylalanine in three groups (Figure S2). To investigate the effect of these three differentially expressed metabolites in predicting the mortality of ARDS, we plotted a ROC curve (Fig. 3e) to assess the sensitivity and specificity. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of Phenylalanine, D-Phenylalanine and Phenylacetylglutamine is 0.803, 0.785 and 0.709, respectively, indicating that Phenylalanine had the highest efficacy in predicting the mortality of ARDS. In the combined model the AUC was 0.882.\n",

We screened the pathways with an impact factor greater than 0 and a P value less than 0.05, the top 5 pathways in the group of ARDS versus healthy controls were 1) purine metabolism pathway, 2) Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, 3) histidine metabolism pathway, 4) Phenylalanine metabolism pathway and 5) glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. In the survivors versus non-survivors group, only three pathways satisfied the standards of screening, they were 1) D-Glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism pathway, 2) Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, and 3) Phenylalanine metabolism pathway. Figure 4c shows that in both the ARDS versus healthy controls group and the non-survivors versus survivors group, Phenylalanine metabolism pathway, Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway were identified as the most significantly altered pathways. To visualize the change of metabolites in the most significantly altered pathways between non-survivors and survivors, the metabolic network was plotted (Fig. 4d), all the matched metabolites in our data that involved in the pathways were marked in red, yellow and green according to the different levels of significance. In Phenylalanine metabolism pathway, five compounds were matched and three of them (Phenylalanine, D-Phenylalanine and phenylacetylglutamine) upregulated while tyrosine and hippurate were downregulated in the non-survivors compared to the survivors. In Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, three metabolites were matched with our data, L-Tryptophan and Phenylalanine levels increased while Tyrosine levels decreased in the non-survivors.

D-Phenylalanine and Phenylacetylglutamine are products of Phenylalanine, and the ROC analysis showed that Phenylalanine had the highest accuracy of predicting the mortality. Therefore, we investigated whether Phenylalanine increased the mortality of ARDS in a mouse model. The ARDS mouse model was established and Phenylalanine was administrated by intravenous injection. As shown in Fig. 5a, mice were pretreated with Phenylalanine at 0 h and received intratracheal injection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) at 24 h. The ARDS mice and sham mice were administrated with either a dose of Phenylalanine or PBS every 24 h, following which the mice started to die at 24 h after injection of PAO1. A significant increase of mortality rate was observed around 54 h, at which time 48% of the mice injected with Phenylalanine and 30% of mice injected with PBS found dead. At 7 days after PAO1 injection, the Phenylalanine group had significantly lower survival rate (8%) compared to those treated with PBS (14%) (Fig. 5b). The same amount of Phenylalanine was administrated in sham mice without ARDS every 24 h for 7 days and no death was observed during the period (Fig. 5b), confirming that the concentration of Phenylalanine we used was not lethal in control mice. To determine the changes of Phenylalanine and other related amid acids in BALF after the Phenylalanine injection, we performed targeted UHPLC-MS/MS to assay Phenylalanine, glutamine, tyrosine and tryptophan in sham mice after two doses of intravenous injection of Phenylalanine. The Phenylalanine in BALF significantly increased after injection, whereas the tyrosine (downstream products of Phenylalanine) did not change, indicating that intravenously injection of Phenylalanine increased the levels of this amino acid in lung. We found the levels of glutamine and tryptophan (not significantly) in BALF also increased after injection of Phenylalanine (Figure S3). The lung injury of mice were assayed 24 h post injection with PAO1, protein and white cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Fig. 5b-c) increased in ARDS mice injected with Phenylalanine compared to those treated with PBS, indicating that Phenylalanine increased the recruitment of inflammatory cells and impairment of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathological changes in lungs of mice with ARDS assayed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining indicated severer destruction of alveoli and inflammation in Phenylalanine group than that in PBS group (Fig. 5e). The lung injury in sham mice treated with Phenylalanine and PBS had no significant differences. Together, these results confirmed that Phenylalanine administration increased the lung injury and mortality of ARDS mice but not in sham mice.\n",

The high serum Phenylalanine is neurotoxic, producing intellectual disability, and other neurologic features [13]. Recently, the role of Phenylalanine in acute inflammatory diseases has been increasingly investigated. It was found that the serum Phenylalanine increased in patients post trauma or with sepsis [14] and was associated with the activation of immune response [15, 16]. In a recent study, Shie-Shian Huang and et al. uncovered that high levels of serum Phenylalanine was associated with high mortality risk in patients with severe infection [17]. Consistent with our findings of Phenylalanine, Akhila Viswan and his colleagues reported that the relative concentration of Phenylalanine increased in non-survivors of ARDS patients compared to survivors [4]. Another study also revealed the upregulation of Phenylalanine metabolism in patients with more severe ARDS compared to those with less severity. Although these studies provided supportive evidence of the associations between Phenylalanine and the prognosis of ARDS, it is hard to determine whether the increased Phenylalanine was just a phenotype reflecting the severity or it also played a role in the process of ARDS [3]. Through the injection of Phenylalanine in ARDS mice, our study demonstrated that Phenylalanine played a detrimental role of in ARDS.",

These enzymes convert Phenylalanine into tyrosine. To be noted that, in our results, the levels of tyrosine decreased in the non-survivors compared to the survivors of ARDS patients (not a significant difference though), which means the turnover of Phenylalanine into tyrosine in the non-survivors may be impaired. A number of studies have indicated that the deficiency of PHA and BH4 in inflammatory disease may be due to the overwhelming production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [12, 19]. Therefore, it was possible but not conclusive that the increased Phenylalanine in the non-survivors of ARDS was due to the deficiency of PHA and BH4 induced by inflammation.",

A study found that intraperitoneal injection of Phenylalanine increased IL-2 secretion in early pregnancy mice, which implied that Phenylalanine could sustain T cell proliferation and thereby enhance the adaptive immune in response [20]. More recently, Ming Jiang et.al demonstrated that Phenylalanine enhanced the innate immune response of the host [21]. Multiple immunological processes involving neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells participate in mediating lung tissue injury in ARDS [22]. Thus the activation of immune response by Phenylalanine may exert negative impact on ARDS. Our data showed that Phenylalanine increased the lung injury of mice with ARDS, which we speculated was associated with the role of Phenylalanine in promoting inflammation.",

The levels of phenylacetylglutamine significantly decreased in human after a 7-day course of oral broad spectrum antibiotics cocktail. Further investigation revealed microbial porA gene in Clostridium facilitated the conversion of Phenylalanine into phenylacetylglutamine [23]. In our study, the levels of phenylacetylglutamine were lower in ARDS than that in controls, which was presumably due to the damage of gut microbiota caused by antibiotics use in ARDS patients. Phenylacetylglutamine was demonstrated to enhance platelet activation-related phenotypes and thrombosis potential in animal models of arterial injury [23]. Pulmonary thrombosis is common in sepsis-induced ARDS shown by human and animal studies [24]. Platelets could promote pulmonary vascular damage in sepsis induced ARDS, thereby aggravating the lung injury [25]. We found the non-survivors of ARDS had higher levels of phenylacetylglutamine than survivors, the mechanisms underlying may be related to the roles of phenylacetylglutamine in modulating platelets and thrombosis.",

Given the high mortality rate of ARDS, even a small improvement can save many lives. Nutritional input may be a good choice as a new adjuvant strategy for ARDS, since most metabolites can be manipulated by simply controlling the uptake from food. Omega-3 fatty acids were once used for treatment of ARDS but ended up with a negative results, one of the reasons for this could be the failure of identifying specific metabolites in ARDS patients [32]. However, with the development of metabolomics, we are able to screen the most specific metabolites that play a role in ARDS [2]. Our study has revealed that controlling the uptake of Phenylalanine might be a novel strategy for treating ARDS. This would also open new avenues in the control of pathological inflammatory responses. Sufficient (high-dose) protein was suggested to be provided in critically ill patients [33], nevertheless, eight essential amino acids including Phenylalanine were indispensable in our commonly used parenteral and enteral nutrition. To reduce the uptake of Phenylalanine, the Phenylalanine-restricted diet designed for phenylketonuria patients might be a good choice. It is a feasible and easy approach that can be implemented in ARDS patients.",

It was difficult to interpret the role of these metabolites, therefore, we didn\u2019t include them in our list of differential metabolites and focused only on the endogenous compounds. Thirdly, the nutritional status of ARDS and control subjects was not controlled for, which could affected the results of metabolomics.
