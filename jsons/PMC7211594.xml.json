The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially recognised COVID-19 as a pandemic and Countries worldwide are now facing huge challenges trying to further prevent its spread and treating the growing number of positive patients. In fact, although the majority of cases are usually self-limiting with mild symptoms such as low-grade fever and cough, the diseases can be deadly [1]. Serious cases of COVID-19 can develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failures leading to death; the mortality rate is much higher in elder patients with pre-existing chronic diseases [1]. Clinicians are searching for a reliable prognostic marker that can distinguish patients at risk of developing more severe forms of disease, in order to better manage hospital resources. The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood has been studied as a systemic inflammatory marker and various works have shown that it is a valid prognostic factor in various solid tumors [3] and other chronic diseases, such as lung, cardiovascular and kidney diseases. In our work we described the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and aimed to assess predictors of clinical outcomes.",

COVID-19 diagnosis was performed via molecular assay from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. For each patient, demographic data, clinical history, laboratory findings and treatment measures during hospitalization were collected. According to sign, symptoms, comorbidities and clinical parameters at admission and during hospitalization, patients were divided into severe and non-severe cases, in accordance with Italian guidelines [3]. Clinical improvement was defined as the resolution of fever for at least 48 hours and the suspension of oxygen supplementation. We used parametric and non-parametric tests, as appropriate, to compare changes; logistic regression analyses were used to assess predictors.",

Regarding pre-existing comorbidities, 24 patients (32.4%) had hypertension, 15 (20.3%) had a pre-existing heart condition while 8 (10.8%) had type 2 diabetes. At hospital admission, median leukokite count was 5900 cell/mm3 (IQR 4412-7782), median neutrophil count was 4240 cell/mm3 (IQR 3122-5995) while median lymphocyte count was 925 cell/mm3 (IQR 700-1275). Median PLR was 191.7 (IQR 133.3-311.0), while median NLR was 4.5 (IQR 3.1-7.1). Forty-one patients (55.4%) had radiological signs of interstitial pneumonia at admission. In our case-series, 19 patients (25.7%) required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during hospitalization. At censor, we registered 8 deaths (10.8% of total population), 25 patients (33.8%) were discharged, while 41 patients (55.4%) were still hospitalized. Among all patients, we recognised 46 severe cases, 62.2% of total cases. Patients with severe disease were significantly older (median age of 70 vs 56, p=0.007) and had a significantly higher NLR (median value 5.6 vs 3.0, p=0.001) compared to non-severe cases.",

In recent weeks, reports on the feasibility of either NLR or PLR in predicting prognosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been published. In particular, a work by Qu et al [4] hypothesized a possible prognostic role of PLR by analyzing the data of a cohort of 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19. A recent work by Qin et al [5], meanwhile, showed a significant higher NLR in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, in a cohort of 452 hospitalized patients. In our study, a higher NLR at hospital admission was associated with a more severe outcome: in particular, a NLR over 4 resulted predictor of transfer to the ICU. Patients with severe disease, presented a significantly higher NLR at admission compared with patients with milder form of COVID-19, a result in line with the work of Qin et al [5], reinforcing the theory of a close association between hyperinflammatory state and COVID-19 pathogenesys.",
