Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) belong to the family of classical GPCRs. These receptors are named based on their capacity to recognize the N-formyl methionine motif in synthetic neutrophil chemotactic peptides and in peptide fragments released into the culture supernatants by Escherichia coli.\n32 The FPR family members are coupled to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi proteins and mediate neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis and activation.11 Although FPRs were identified and cloned in the early 1990s,19 the biological function of these receptors remains poorly understood. However, with the identification of a number of novel nonformylated and host-derived agonists for FPRs, it is becoming evident that these receptors and their peptide ligands play important roles in innate and adaptive immune responses.",

Recently, these GPCRs were renamed as FPR1, FPR2/ALX (FPRL1), and FPR3 (FPRL2). FPR1 and FPR2 share 69% identity at the amino acid level, whereas FPR3 has 56% amino acid sequence identity to human FPR1 and 83% to FPR2.32 Both human FPR1 and FPR2 are expressed in many cell types, such as myeloid cells including monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and immature dendritic cells (DCs), endothelial cells, hepatocytes, astrocytes, microglial cells, and fibroblasts.32 The expression of human FPR3 is more restricted and is detected in monocytes/macrophages and DCs but not in neutrophils.32 FPR3 is also expressed in plasmacytoid DCs and is upregulated on cell maturation.10 The signal transduction pathways of FPRs have been more extensively studied with FPR1 in phagocytic cells and in cell lines transfected with cloned receptor. The interaction of FPR1 with its agonist peptide fMLF uncouples trimeric G proteins to elicit a signaling cascade that activates phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) and PI3 kinases (PI3Ks), which are translated into biological functions of receptor-bearing cells including chemotaxis and mediator release. FPR1 and FPR2 also crosstalk with some receptor tyrosine kinases, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).12., 15.\n",

These NKT cells limit the immunosuppressive activity of neutrophils by decreasing IL-10, but increasing IL-12 production, thereby enhancing the anti-melanoma host responses.8 These new developments highlight the critical function of FPR1 and FPR2 in innate and adaptive host responses.",

The chemotactic activity of fMLF for neutrophils is increased by an oligoethylene glycol substituent.16 In addition to its chemotactic activity for myeloid cells, fMLF also induces intestinal epithelial cell migration and participates in epithelial restitution and wound closure.32 The activity of fMLF on intestinal epithelial cells is attributed to FPR1, which is located along actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial extrusions associated with activated PI3K, Rac1, and Cdc42.32 In human mesenchymal stem cells, fMLF stimulates signaling pathways coupled to FPR1 that drive phospholipase C (PLC)/phospholipase D (PLD)-Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II-ERK-CREB during osteogenic differentiation. By contrast, fMLF inhibits the expression of PPAR\u03b31 and suppresses adipocytic commitment during differentiation.28 Thus, FPR1 and its agonist fMLF also display important functions in nonhematopoietic cells. In addition to fMLF, there are other N-formyl peptides derived from bacteria. For example, a pentapeptide fMIVIL from L. monocytogenes and a tetrapeptide fMIFL from Staphylococcus aureus preferentially activate mFPR1.32 fMFEDAVAWF derived from Mycobacterium avium also activates FPR1.32\n",

Anx A1, also named lipocortin I, is a glucocorticoid-regulated, phosphorylated-binding protein possessing both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory activity mediated in part by FPR1. Expressed in a variety of cell types, Anx A1 is particularly abundant in neutrophils where it is located on the outer cell surface and serves to inhibit neutrophil transendothelial migration. At low concentrations, Anx A1 and its N-terminal peptides (Ac2\u201326 and Ac9\u201325) elicit Ca2+ transients through FPR1 to desensitize neutrophils and inhibit its transendothelial migration induced by the chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8).32 At high concentrations, the Anx A1 peptides activate neutrophils as potent proinflammatory stimulants. The antimigratory activity of exogenous and endogenous Anx A1 has been shown in both acute and chronic models of inflammation. More recent studies revealed that Anx A1 peptides may also use FPR2 and, to a lesser extent, FPR3, suggesting a complex role for FPRs in Anx A1\u2013mediated regulation of host responses. In addition to neutrophils, Anx A1 also regulates T cell receptor30 signaling. Stimulation of T cells via TCR leads to the secretion of endogenous Anx A1 and a simultaneous externalization of its receptor FPR2 on the plasma membrane, highlighting a \u201ccoordinated\u201d signaling of \u201cAnx A1\u2013FPR\u201d system.5 In the presence of Anx A1, naive T cells differentiate toward Th1 cells, whereas Anx-A1-deficient T cells produce high levels of Th2 cytokines.5., 7. Also, in Anx A1-deficient T cells, the production of IL-17 as well as FPR2 signaling is impaired during differentiation in Th17-skewing conditions.6 In addition, tumor growth and metastasis are markedly decreased in Anx A1-KO mice, whereas the survival and tumor necrosis are significantly increased, due to impaired angiogenesis.33 These observations demonstrate a complex role of Anx A1 and FPR2 in multiple pathophysiological processes.",

TA is also chemotactic in vivo, because it elicited infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes into the injection site in mice. Another temporin peptide Rana-6 is chemotactic for human phagocytes also by using FPR2. Thus, frog-derived temporins have the capacity to chemoattract phagocytes through human FPR2 and the mouse homolog mFPR2, suggesting the participation of amphibian antimicrobial peptides in host innate immunity. Because the expression of FPR homolog(s) has not been reported in species other than mammals, it will be interesting to clarify whether such receptor exists in amphibians and other species such as insects, which normally rely on the secretion of antimicrobial peptides as a natural host defense.3\n",

F2L chemoattracts and activates monocyte-derived DCs, thus seems to be a novel and unique natural chemoattractant peptide for FPR3 in DCs and monocytes, in agreement with the selective expression of FPR3 in these cells,32 suggesting its role in linking innate and adaptive immune responses by activating antigen-presenting FPR3+ DCs, which express reduced levels of FPR1 and FPR2. In mice, mouse F2L activates neutrophils by using mFPR2, a homolog of human FPR2, because neutrophils from mFPR2\u2212/\u2212 mice lost all responsiveness to F2L.

For instance, WKYMVm, a hexapeptide representing a modified sequence isolated from a random peptide library, was initially reported to be an efficacious stimulant of human B lymphocytes, monocytic cell lines, as well as peripheral blood neutrophils. It was subsequently found that WKYMVm uses both FPR1 and FPR2, and is by far the most potent peptide agonist for FPR2 to chemoattract and activate human phagocytic cells.32 The WKYMVm analog, produced by converting the D-amino acid methionine at the C-terminus into to an L-amino acid, becomes a more selective agonist of FPR2 and also a weaker activator of FPR3.3 Another peptide, MMK-1, which is also derived from a random peptide library, is a potent and very selective chemotactic agonist for FPR2. Although FPR agonists identified in random peptide libraries seem not to be pathophysiologically relevant to diseases, they nevertheless constitute useful pharmacological tools for the studies of FPR signaling pathways, structural basis of the ligands versus receptors, and identification of receptor antagonists that could be valuable in conditions resulted from receptor overactivation.",

However, despite the original observation of LXA4 being a chemotactic agonist for FPR2, this lipid metabolite has been shown to mainly exert inhibitory activities on a variety of inflammatory responses. LXA4 inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cell lines in response to TNF\u03b1 and LPS, while it simulates the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.32 In DCs, LXA4/ATL activates the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-2 and in T cells, LXA4 attenuates TNF\u03b1 release by impairing ERK signaling.32 LXA4 also prevents renal fibrosis by inhibiting PDGF-induced TGF-\u03b2 production in mesangial cells.32 In addition, LXA4 attenuates inflammation-induced pain and displays proresolution properties in various disease models, including dermal inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion injury, peritonitis, colitis, cystic fibrosis, asthma, parasitic infection and glomerulonephritis.32 The multiplicity of the anti-inflammatory activity of LXA4 raises the question of how this lipid mediator shares FPR2 with other peptide agonists that trigger a proinflammatory signaling pathway. One plausible explanation was that LXA4 binds to an FPR2 domain, which is different from the domains utilized by peptide agonists. However, because LXA4 has been reported to interact with multiple receptors depending on the cell types, it remains to be clarified whether the biological function of LXA4 is the consequence of interaction with more than one receptor.",

It is now clear that FPRs play important roles in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses. The process of understanding of the biological roles of FPRs has been considerably prompted by the identification of a variety of ligands from different sources, in particular, from microbes and human. In addition to the evidence that the FPRs are involved in antimicrobial defense and inflammation, they are also implicated in the progression of cancer. For example, FPR1 is selectively expressed by highly malignant human glioma cells and increases the motility, growth, and angiogenesis of human glioblastoma by interacting with host-derived agonist(s) released by necrotic tumor cells.35 An effort to identify potential FPR1 agonist(s) in glioma cell supernatant revealed Anx A1 as a major component.31 Therefore, FPR1 and Anx A1 axis may constitute targets for novel antiglioma therapy. Human FPR2 is also expressed in astrocytoma cell line,9 hepatocellar carcinoma,23 and breast cancer17 with yet unclear pathophysiological implications.",
