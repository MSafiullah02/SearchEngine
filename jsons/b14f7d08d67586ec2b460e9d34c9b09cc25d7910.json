To verify the calculations, we compared the value of J max for a 3.7 nL evaporating water droplet on a glass surface, reported in Ref. 13 , using finite element simulations. The computed value of J max using eq. 8 is 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 kg m \u22122 s \u22121 , while the value at the contact line in the previous study 13 Second, we present the effect of ambient temperature, surface wettability, and relative humidity on the drying time of the droplet. In this context, we examine the drying time of a deposited droplet in two different ambient temperatures, 25 o C and 40 o C. The chosen temperatures are representative of temperatures inside a room with air-conditioning and outdoors in summer. Fig. 3 shows the variation of evaporation time with droplet volume, at the two different ambient temperatures considered. The contact angle and humidity for these simulations are taken as 30 o and 50%, respectively. At 25 o C, the evaporation time for small droplets is about 6 s, which increases to 27 s for large size droplets. The evaporation time increases as the square of the droplet radius, or 2/3 power of volume. An increase in ambient temperature reduces the evaporation time substantially (by about 50% for 15 o C rise in temperature). Therefore, an increase in the ambient temperature is expected to drastically reduce the chance of infection through contact with an infected droplet.",

The results of the simula-tions corresponding to these two contact angles are plotted in Fig. 3 . The ambient temperature and humidity are taken as 25 \u2022 C and 50%, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the effect of the surface can be quite profound; the evaporation time can increase by 60% for a more hydrophobic surface. With a decrease in contact angle, the droplet spreads into a thin film, which has a relatively large mass loss rate from the droplet to the ambient. Therefore, for a surface with a smaller contact angle, the evaporation time of the droplet is smaller. The effect of the surface can further manifest by a difference in temperature in different parts of the surface. Such inhomogeneity in surface temperature can be brought about by the difference in the surface material (leading to the difference in the emissivity) or differential cooling (for example, due to the corner effect). Even a slight difference in the surface temperature can further aggravate the surface effect by influencing the evaporation time.",

Here, we examine the effect of the relative humidity on the survival of the virus inside a droplet, deposited on a surface. Fig. 3 shows that the relative humidity has a strong effect on the evaporation time. The contact angle and ambient temperature for these calculations are taken as 30 o and 25 o C, respectively. The evaporation time of a droplet increases almost 7-fold with an increase in humidity from 10% to 90%. Further, the evaporation time becomes greater than 2 min for large droplets at high humidity. With the increase in humidity in coastal areas in summer and later in other parts of Asia in July-September with advent of Monsoon, this may become an issue, as there will be sufficient time for the virus to spread from the droplet to new hosts, upon contact with the infected droplet. Therefore, a larger humidity increases the survival of the virus when it is inside the droplet, however, it decreases its chances of the survival if the virus is airborne.",

The evaporation time of a droplet is a critical parameter as it determines the duration over which spread of infection from the droplet to another person coming in contact with the droplet, is possible. The virus needs a medium to stay alive 5 ; therefore, once the droplet has evaporated, the virus is not expected to survive. The evaporation time can, therefore, be taken as an indicator of the survival time of the virus. In general, it is regarded that a temperature of 60 o C maintained for more than 60 min inactivates most viruses 23 ; however, contrary reports about the effect of temperature on the survivability of SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported. 24, 25 Our results indicate that the survival time of the virus depends on the surface on which the droplet has fallen, along with the temperature and humidity of the ambient air. The present results are expected to be of relevance in two different scenarios: When droplets are generated by an infected person by coughing or sneezing (in the absence of a protective mask), or when fine droplets are sprayed on a surface for cleaning/disinfecting the surface. A wide range of droplet sizes is expected to be produced in these cases. The mutual interaction of the droplets, such that they interfere in the evaporation dynamics, is however expected to be weak because of the large distance between the droplets as compared to their diameter.",

We hypothesize that since the drying time of a respiratory droplet on a surface is linked to the survival of the droplet, it is correlated with the growth of the pandemic. Since the drying time is a function of weather, we compare the growth of infection with the drying time for different cities. The cities were selected based on cold/warm and dry/humid weather. The growth of the total number of infections is plotted for cities with different weather during the pandemic in Fig. 5 . The data of the infections were obtained from public repositories 28, 29 . The data were fitted with linear curves using the least-squares method and the slope of the fits represents the growth rate (number of infections per day) of the respective city. The growth rate of New York City and Singapore is the largest and lowest, respectively. For different cities, we compute the drying time of a droplet of 5 nL volume, which is the mean volume obtained using PDF of the distribution (Fig. 1) . The ambient temperature and relative humidity are taken as mean of the respective ranges, listed in Table II . As discussed earlier, the drying time increases with increase in humidity, however, it decreases with increase in ambient temperature. Thus, the combined effect of humidity and temperature decides the final drying time. This can be illustrated by comparing the drying time of Singapore and New York city, plotted in Fig. 6 . The time is shorter for the former as compared to the latter, despite with a large humidity for the former (70-80%) as compared to the latter (50-60%).",

            "text": "In closure, we have examined the likelihood of survival of the SARS-CoV-2 virus suspended in respiratory droplets originated from a COVID-19 infected subject. The droplet considered to be evaporating in a quiet ambient on different surfaces. The droplets volume range is considered as [1, 10] nL. The datasets of drying time presented here for different ambient conditions and surfaces will be helpful in future studies. The likelihood of the survival of the virus increases roughly by 5 times in a humid ambient as compared to a dry ambient. The growth rate of the COVID-19 was found to be weakly correlated with the outdoor weather. While the present Letter discusses the results in the context of COVID-19, the present model is also valid for respiratory droplets of other transmissible diseases, such as Influenza A.",
