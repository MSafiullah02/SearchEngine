            "text": "Viral fitness is determined by replication within hosts and transmission between them. We examine how pleiotropic mutations that have antagonistic effects (i.e., antibody evasion vs. receptor binding) on viral replication within hosts can impact viral immune escape in the host population. When the host population is vaccinated, the virus escapes from passive immunity by mutations in the antibody-binding region on the surface of the target protein. However, the reduced ability of the antibody to bind the virus is often accompanied by a reduced ability of the virus to bind the cell receptor because the antibody-binding region overlaps with the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The types of permitted mutations are limited. To investigate the causal relation between a mutation in a viral genome and adaptive evolution of a viral population, we developed a mathematical model that describes the population dynamics of viruses, antibodies, and normal/infected cells within a host. The coefficients describe the binding affinity between the virus and the induced antibody and that between the virus and its receptor. Our knowledge-based index enables us to estimate the effect of a mutation in a binding region on the binding affinity. Using population genetic theory, we evaluated the probability that a mutant is fixed in a host population. The mutations that can be fixed with high probabilities may determine how long a vaccine remains effective. We simulate the adaptive evolution of coronavirus, the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and show that some of mutations in the RBD may have high fixation probabilities in the vaccinated host population.",

Phenotypic evolution is driven by selection pressure acting on viability and/or reproductive ability. Physiological and developmental processes of higher organisms are robust against genomic mutations (Wagner 2000; Li et al. 2004 ). Due to this buffering mechanism, genetic variations are preserved in phenotypically normal populations, and it is therefore difficult to establish a causal relationship between genomic mutations and phenotypic alterations (Rutherford 2000) . On the other hand, viruses have a simple life cycle, so their adaptive evolution can be explained by a few factors (Beerenwinkel et al. 2002) . In viral evolution, mutations in genetic coding sequences may correlate with phenotypic evolution through structural changes in proteins that function at various stages of the life cycle. This enables the simultaneous investigation of the phenotypic and genotypic evolution of viruses by monitoring the structural changes in proteins that are caused by genotypic changes and that are reflected in phenotypic differences.",

Our knowledgebased index of binding affinities, or association constants (Watabe et al. 2007 ), enables us to estimate changes in the values of the coefficients due to mutation.

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attach its spike (S) protein to the host cell (Li et al. 2003) . The cross-species transmission of the virus was permitted by a few amino acid substitutions in the RBD of the S protein Song et al. 2005) . In order to prevent reemergence of SARS, potent therapeutics and vaccines are needed. The S protein is a major antigenic determinant and is therefore an attractive target for neutralizing antibodies. It has been suggested that passive immunization with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) might be used to treat SARS (Holmes 2003) , and human mAbs with a potent neutralizing effect against the RBD of the S protein have been identified (Sui et al. 2004; Prabakaran et al. 2006 ). Using our knowledge-based model of viral population dynamics and population genetics, we predict amino acid mutations that are most likely to fix in the viral population.",

In this study, we determine a mutant virus by different values of the two parameters of the mathematical model and assume that the parameters are proportional to the association constants of the protein complexes: the S protein-ACE2 receptor complex and the S proteinantibody complex. We simulate the emergence of mutants by changing the amino acid sequence of the RBD of the S protein. The amino acid substitutions in the RBD affect the association constants of the protein complexes, and hence, the parameters of the mathematical model that characterize the virus change. We determine the amino acid mutation rate by structural constraints on the muta-tions. In the simulation, the rate is incorporated by generating mutations according to the amino acid preferences in the local structural environment, and the association constants are evaluated by a knowledge-based sequencestructure fitness measure (Watabe et al. 2007 ).",

The incubation period of SARS is usually 3-5 days (World Health Organization 2003) , and the virus can infect new hosts until medical treatment occurs. The medical treatment may start within a few days of onset. Hence we should consider 5-8 days as a time period that the virus can infect to other hosts. Therefore, we set the range of integration as 0 to s. On the (b,q)-plane, a viral fitness landscape is given based on changes in w. Viruses with higher values of w can infect new hosts more efficiently. On the other hand, the final results of our analysis do not depend much on the value of s (data not shown). The aspect of the fitness landscape is characterized by the truncation of the integration itself rather than the time point of the truncation. Hence, we set the value of s equal to 10 days.",

The parameters of the mathematical model, (b,q), represent the strengths of couplings between virus particles and uninfected cells and between virus particles and antibodies. Those couplings are mediated by proteins: the S proteins, the ACE2 receptors, and the fragments of antigen-binding (Fabs) of antibody. Hence, we assume that the parameters of the mathematical model, (b,q), have the following relationships to the association constants of the protein complexes (K a .

In order to carry out in silico calculations, information about the structure of the corresponding molecular complex is needed as a template. In the case of SARS-CoV, the structure of the complex formed between the RBD and the peptidase domain of human ACE2 has been determined (Li F et al. 2005) , and X-ray crystallography data are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The structure of the S protein when bound by a neutralizing antibody has also been described (Hwang et al. 2006; Prabakaran et al. 2006) . In order to estimate the binding free energy of the protein complex, the protein-protein interactions must be investigated. Several computational methods have been proposed (Elcock et al. 2001) . Molecular dynamics simulations have increasingly been used to study protein-protein interactions. However, because of long convergence time, molecular dynamics simulations are prohibitive for large systems such as protein complexes (Cui et al. 2008) . In this study, we employ a Structural Considerations in the Fitness Landscape \u00b7 doi:10.1093/molbev/msq056 knowledge-based sequence-structure fitness measure (Watabe et al. 2007 ) to evaluate the binding affinities between the S protein of SARS-CoV and the Fabs of mAbs and also those between the S protein and its receptor. The sequence-structure fitness measure is a likelihood-based index, which quantifies a degree to which a sequence fits in a given structure. The measure is calculated empirically based on amino acid preferences and pairwise interactions in structural environments present in template structures. By bypassing structural prediction, it is possible to analyze thousands of sequences and correlate high-fitness sequences with structural changes along evolutionary pathways.",

The degree of residue burial characterizes the local environment of a residue, which is defined as the number of C a atoms surrounding the C a atom of the corresponding residue within a distance of 1 nm (10 \u00c5 ) (Watabe et al. 2007) . The spatial distances between the C a atoms of each amino acid pair are categorized into intervals of 0.1 nm from 0.7 to 1 nm. Pairs with spatial distances of 0.7 nm are compiled into one category because such small distances are rare (Watabe et al. 2007 ). The interaction between a residue and its neighborhood in the primary sequence plays a major role in making local structural conformations, such as an a-helix. Hence, we treat interactions between residues with small site intervals j \u00c0 i 4 separately from those with larger site intervals (Watabe et al. 2006 ).

Hwang et al. (2006) have described the structure of the complex formed between the S protein and a neutralizing antibody, 80R (PDB code: 2GHW). The 80R-binding epitope on the RBD overlaps very closely with the ACE2-binding site (Hwang et al. 2006 ). Prabakaran et al.

Furthermore, as predicted from equation (1), the dynamics of a virus with slow replication (R 0 ; 1) does not depend on the binding affinity of neutralizing antibody during the early stages of infection (see supplementary material, Supplementary Material online).

            "text": "Within a host population vaccinated with the antibody 80R, the mutation D480V shows a high fixation probability. This is a result of decreased binding affinity of the antibody 80R to the S protein. Residue 480D has been previously suggested as a key residue determining binding to the antibody 80R (Sui et al. 2008 ). It has also been suggested that mutations at this residue do not affect binding to the receptor (Wong et al. 2004) . By a mutation to a hydrophobic amino acid from another type of amino acid, the hydrophobic interaction becomes stronger, increasing the binding affinity. However, the binding affinity of the antibody 80R to the S protein is dominated by pairwise interactions. The mutation D480V decreases the binding affinity. In proteinprotein associations, hydrophobic interactions seem to be less dominant (Gohlke et al. 2003) . The mutation I489K reduces the intensity of hydrophobic interactions. However, the binding affinity of the S protein-receptor complex increases, whereas that of the S protein-antibody 80R complex decreases. This difference is due to the different effects of the mutation on the pairwise interactions.",

We examined how immune escape occurs when mutations have antagonistic effects on binding antibody and receptors. We simplified this complex, multiscale problem by modeling response to mAbs in order to gain a fundamental understanding of viral evolutionary response to adaptive immunity. Our simplified model takes advantage of the rich supply of protein structural data and sequence data that are readily available for several viruses, providing a framework that can be adapted for other viruses. In future studies, we plan to extend our model to deal with polyclonal antibodies, which is a more realistic immune response.",

            "text": "We found that some amino acid mutations in the RBD may have a high fixation probability (greater than 0.9). Within the range of variation of the SAA mutations on the fitness landscape, some mutants produce sufficient changes in binding strengths to achieve high fixation probabilities within the host population. The variation in binding strengths corresponds to the variation in association constants calculated by using the structural preference of the amino acid sequence, which was estimated using structural data stored in the PDB. Hence, the appearance of the mutants that may be fixed with high probability within the host population is not a grandiose figment but in reality it can happen. The time span of the occurrence of the mutants fixed within the host population can be measured by setting an explicit value of the rate a i at which mutations occur at the corresponding residue. By measuring the time span, we can determine the effective period of the vaccine. In development of vaccine, it may be crucial to address the emergencies of such mutations in the RBD.",
