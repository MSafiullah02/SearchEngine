            "text": "Influenza A is an enveloped virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae that\ncomprises a negative-sense segmented RNA genome. Influenza viruses are extremely\nvariable owing to a lack of proofreading during genome replication; therefore,\nmutations are continuously accumulated.1\u20133 Antigenic drift and antigenic\nshift are ongoing processes that result in the existence of a large amount of\ninfluenza viruses whose natural reservoirs include wild waterfowl and shorebirds.4 Reports indicate minimal evolution and apparent signs of disease in almost\nall natural reservoirs, but the occurrence of accumulated mutations in the genome or\nin certain fragments might benefit cross-species transmission.4\u20137 Influenza A viruses have the\ncapacity to evolve rapidly and cause epidemics or even pandemics in domestic\npoultry, lower mammals, and humans. Avian influenza virus (AIV) transmission has\nbeen reported in several countries, with sporadic human infections owing to transfer\nof the virus from wild birds (e.g., migrating or wild aquatic birds) to domestic\npoultry.6,8\nThe first reported AIV infection in humans was caused by H5N1 virus and occurred in\nHong Kong in 1997.6,9\nSubsequently, AIVs have been continuously monitored and surveyed. Increasingly more\nnew subtypes of AIVs have emerged in recent decades.6",

            "text": "In February of 2013, a new atypical influenza virus, H7N9, was first reported in an\n87-year-old male in Shanghai, China and the case was confirmed by the Chinese Center\nfor Disease Control and Prevention on 29 March 2013.10\u201312 H7N9 is an emerging avian\ninfluenza A virus owing to genetic reassortment.13 This virus was first identified as having low pathogenicity and was\nassociated with asymptomatic or mild disease in poultry, causing sporadic human\ninfections.12,14\u201317 A clinical survey of human\ninfections with H7N9 viruses revealed characteristics of upper and lower respiratory\ntract illnesses that varied from mild to moderate (conjunctivitis or uncomplicated\ninfluenza-like illness) and could result in hospitalization.18\u201320 These novel H7N9 AIVs were\nreported to have gradually developed into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\nviruses,21,22 indicating multiple increased polybasic amino acids at the\nhemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site (PEVPKRKRTAR/GL).22 High mortality rates of about 50% are reported in human cases.18,22 Phylogenetic\nanalysis of HA sequences in H7N9 isolates indicates that two major lineages of H7N9\nhave been established, including the Yangtze River Delta lineage and the Pearl River\nDelta lineage.23 Reports indicate that the Yangtze River Delta lineage is broadly dispersed\nand was the original source of the H7N9 outbreaks in humans.23,24 China is\ncurrently facing its sixth epidemic of H7N9 human infection since 2018, and there\nhas been a total of 1566 laboratory-confirmed human cases reported since 2013.25 The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that three subtypes of AIVs are\ncurrently known to cause human infection, namely, H5, H7, and H9.26 Among them, H5N1 and H7N9 have caused the most human infections.27 This implies a challenge for global public health services in controlling\nemerging influenza viruses, even though the number of human infections with the H7N9\ninfluenza virus has gradually decreased with treatment.28 At present, there is no prophylactic vaccine against H7N9 AIV infection\nlicensed for use in humans. The vaccine candidates currently under investigation\ninclude HA/NA peptide, plasmid-based, baculovirus-insect and mammalian protein\nexpression system, and virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines.29\u201335 Some developed candidate\nvaccines are moving on to clinical trials. In addition, accurate and prompt\ndiagnostic methods that have high sensitivity and specificity are essential for H7N9\ninfluenza disease control and prevention. Several modified, advanced, conventional,\nand molecular diagnostic assays have been developed to enhance the capability of\ndetecting H7N9 antigen or antibody.36\u201340 In this study, we conducted a\nsystemic literature review of the emergent H7N9 AIVs in China, mainly focusing on\npathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of human infection.",

Currently, several emerging genotypes of\nH7N9 AIVs have been identified, including cocirculating low pathogenic avian\ninfluenza (LPAI) and HPAI, causing infections in poultry and humans.\nPrevious reports have indicated that in the first wave of the H7N9 influenza\noutbreak, a total of 27 genotypes were observed and documented between 2013\nand 2014.12,44 The G0 genotype is predominantly found in human\nH7N9 infection whereas the G2, G4, and G5 genotypes are mainly detected in\npoultry. Most H7N9 genotypes were detected in the Yangtze River Delta area\nin China. More recent genotypic studies have identified dynamic reassortment\nof some internal genes among LPAI H7N9/H9N2/H6Ny and HPAI H7N9, as well as\nsurface genes between the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta\nlineages, resulting in at least 36 genotypes identified in 2017.45,46 Among\nthem, three main genotypes predominate, including G1\n(A/chicken/Jiangsu/SC537/2013-like strain), G3\n(A/chicken/Zhongshan/ZS/2017-like strain), and G11 (A/Anhui/40094/2015-like strain).46",

Although animal-to-human transmission\nis the main route of infection, some studies have reported the possibility\nof human-to-human transmission using clusters of human cases and tracing\ndata; however, these studies found very low basic reproduction number (R)\nestimates.9,49\u201353 However, Kucharski et al.43 reported finding no evidence of reduced human-to-human transmission\nin the two outbreak waves associated with the closure of live poultry\nmarkets, indicating that higher basic R estimates were reported for the\nhuman-to-human transmission component. Despite the high susceptibility and\noccurrence of transmission among household or family members, it has not\nbeen well demonstrated that the H7N9 virus is capable of human-to-human\nspread.54,55 Poultry exposure remains the main risk factor for\nhuman H7N9 infection.43,55,56 In addition, travelers\nalso represent a potential risk factor in the dissemination of H7N9 AIVs\nfrom epidemic regions to non-epidemic areas.3,57\u201360 The WHO has suggested\nthat the health status of international travelers returning from H7N9\nepidemic areas should be assessed on arrival, and these individuals should\nbe monitored or observed by health care workers for any apparent symptoms\nindicative of possible infection .26 Although imported cases of human H7N9 infection have been identified,\nthe opportunity for spread at community level is unlikely as the virus has\nnot adapted to humans.3,57\u201360 Furthermore, health\nadvisories and communications should warn travelers to avoid exposure to\npoultry and raw poultry products while visiting affected areas. In people\nwith a history of travel to affected regions, screening should begin within\n2 weeks of departure, prior to the onset of acute respiratory illness.\nPatients are encouraged to disclose recent travel histories, and health care\nworkers should obtain information regarding travel to affected\nareas.26,52,61 Public health and laboratory partners are suggested\nto notify suspected cases during the diagnostic work-up so as to receive\nguidance in a timely manner.61",

However, A/Shanghai/1/2013\nhas been found to be phylogenetically distinct from the other two strains\nmentioned above.80 Compared with human cases of infection with HPAI H7N9 (e.g.,\nA/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 or A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017), most patients\ninfected with A/Shanghai/1/2013 have viral pneumonia and some patients have\ndisplayed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially elderly\npeople, who also have high fatality rates.22,81 Overall, the clinical\npresentation of HAPI H7N9 infection is similar to that of LPAI H7N9 infection;22 however, fewer patients with HPAI than LPAI H7N9 infection have\nunderlying conditions.82",

Previous studies of HPAI H5N1 virus and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus\nhave suggested that poor prognosis in human disease caused by these\ninfluenza viruses might be attributed to a cytokine storm or\nhypercytokinemia in the body.83\u201385 Some studies of H7N9\nAIV have analyzed the cytokine and chemokine profiles in human serum samples\nfrom H7N9-infected patients. Reports have showed the presence of high levels\nof cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, IL-2,\nmonocyte chemotactic protein (MIP)-1, the monokine induced by gamma\ninterferon (MIG), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2, in the serum\nof patients infected with H7N9 AIV.86,87 Moreover, in patients\nwith severe H7N9 infection, the expressed levels of IL-6 and IP-10 molecules\nare significantly higher than in asymptomatic patients with H7N9 infection.86 However, a previous study using BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse models\nassessed the pathogenicity of H7N9 virus, to examine the association of\nproinflammatory cytokines in lung injury and viral clearance. The findings\nof that study showed that TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 suppress viral gene expression and\nincrease viral clearance whereas IL-6 and MCP-1 contribute to lung injury in\nA/H7N9-infected mice.88 In summary, H7N9 viruses potently induce the expression of\nproinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, and IL-7) and chemokines (IP-10),\nwhich contributes to the regulation of cellular immune responses.\nAlternatively, H7N9 infection also induces strong inflammatory responses,\nleading to tissue destruction.",

Both M2 ion channel blockers\n(adamantanes, amantadine, and rimantadine) and NA inhibitors (oseltamivir,\nzanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) are used clinically as antiviral\ndrugs for influenza infection in humans.90\u201392 Owing to the S31N\nmutation in the M2 protein, emerging H7N9 viruses are reported to be\nresistant to adamantine antiviral drugs,93 which are therefore not recommended for clinical therapy.\nOseltamivir, generally used as treatment for influenza infection, reduces\nthe viral load in the respiratory tract of patients. Drug resistance to NA\ninhibitors is unusual among influenza viruses. However, some patients with\nH7N9 AIV infection have poor clinical outcome. The arginine to lysine\nsubstitution at residue R292K and E119V mutation in NA protein are linked\nwith resistance to NA inhibitors, including oseltamivir and\nperamivir.90,94\u201397\nRibavirin is a well-characterized, broad-spectrum nucleoside inhibitor,\nwhich is used for the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and capping of mRNA.\nRibavirin also has antiviral activity against NA inhibitor-resistant H7N9\nvirus infections.98 Human infections with avian H7N9 influenza virus mainly originate\nfrom contact with infected poultry.

These strains have been found to be\nphylogenetically related to the HA of H7N9 viruses. Several previous reports\nhave shown that serum from individuals vaccinated with these vector-based or\ninactivated vaccines cross-reacted with H7N9.114\u2013116 Baculovirus-insect cell\nexpression vectors used in the rapid production of insect cell recombinant\nantigens is a practicable strategy in the development of HA-based vaccines.\nOther viral vectors (e.g., adenovirus and poxvirus) are also used to prepare vaccines.31 The modified vaccinia virus Ankara and chimpanzee adenoviral ChAdOx1\nvaccines are considered safe and immunogenic in humans for inducing long-term\ncross-reactive antibody against influenza A virus. These vaccines can be\ndeveloped in a short time, to be used against emerging influenza strains.\nMoreover, an H7 and N9 molecule-containing vaccine, which is VLP-based from the\nA/Anhui/1/13 strain, has been reported to be producible by the baculovirus system.107 A dose of this VLP vaccine administered twice together with an adjuvant\nsignificantly increases the neutralizing ability of HA- and NA-inhibiting\nantibody.32,107 The low-immunogenicity characteristics of H7-based\nvaccines have been reported in human117 and animal models.118 Currently, several clinical trials are investigating the effect of\ndifferent adjuvants, including MF59 (Novartis), Matrix-M (Novavax), and AS03\n(GlaxoSmithKline), to improve generation of protective antibodies.119\u2013121 Regarding poultry\nvaccination against H7N9 AIVs, a series of inactivated vaccines has been used\nfor the control and prevention of H7N9 outbreaks in poultry.100,122,123 For\nexample, an H5/H7 bivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for chickens, ducks,\nand geese was introduced in September 2017;124,125 cases of H7N9 infections\nin human and poultry populations decreased after vaccination.126,127",

The influence of animal infections on human disease propagation places a\nlarge burden on health systems and animal trade controls to prevent the virus\nspreading via travelers and animal movement. Although AIVs usually do not infect\npeople, rare cases of human infection with these viruses have been reported.53 Regarding the transmission route, H7N9 AIVs have been found to cause human\ninfection, mainly from poultry to humans. Infected birds can shed H7N9 AIVs in\nsecretions like saliva, mucous, and feces, which can lead to human infection via\nmucosal surfaces of the eyes, nose, and mouth or through inhalation of droplets and\ndust containing the virus. Unprotected exposure to H7N9 AIVs from infected birds is\ncurrently considered the main risk factor and transmission route. The role of\npoultry farms, live animal markets, and retailers might be key in the spread of\ndisease, as well as inadequate biosafety measures and poor handling of sick or dead\nanimals. However, some laboratory-confirmed human cases lack evidence of a history\nof direct contact with animals, indicating the possibility of human-to-human\ntransmission.53,149 To date, several studies have predicted and compared the route\nof poultry-to-human or human-to-human transmitted efficiency of H7N9 AIVs using the\nreproduction number (R);43,56,120,140,150 The R is a key indicator of transmission intensity estimated\nby fitting the number of poultry-to-human and from human-to-human infections into\nmathematical models. The data of these studies showed that the estimated R value for\nan H7N9 outbreak was below the epidemic threshold required for sustained\nhuman-to-human transmission, indicating that an H7N9 human-to-human pandemic is\nunlikely to occur and most cases of H7N9 AIV infection are owing to poultry-to-human\ntransmission. Virlogeux et al.149 recently used an ecological model to evaluate animal-to-human and\nhuman-to-human transmission of H7N9 during the first three epidemic waves in China;\nthe authors indicated that there was a significant decrease in the incidence of H7N9\ncases after live poultry market closures in several major cities of China.\nAccordingly, it can be concluded that although H7N9 human-to-human transmission\nmight be possible, the major transmission route of H7N9 AIVs remains via\npoultry-to-human.",

Although viral\nculture is conventionally viewed as the gold standard in virological assays,\nreal-time RT-PCR is currently suggested as an alternative gold standard as the\nformer method requires specific BSL laboratory conditions and experienced staff.\nHowever, RIDTs are quick and easy to perform, so these tests have become essential\nat sites where real-time RT-PCR is unavailable. Current RIDTs have the capability of\ndetecting strains of both influenza A and B. However, they have low sensitivity with\nnew strains and are unable to differentiate between subtypes; therefore, the rate of\nfalse negatives is higher.131RIDTs provide rapid detection of the presence or absence of viral analytes in\npatient samples; a major advantage of RIDTs is that results can be obtained within\n15\u201330 minutes.131 As mentioned, there are several different subtypes of H7N9 AIVs circulating\nin China, some more pathogenic than others. With the advantage of speedy results,\nRIDTs that can differentiate between subtypes would provide a breakthrough for rapid\nscreening and diagnosis, especially of HPAI H7N9 and AIVs such as H5N1.134 RIDTs can be performed at points-of-care for first-line influenza virus screening.134 This would help in patient diagnosis as well as the detection of asymptomatic\ncases or mild symptom cases, thus preventing further spread.163 In addition, several advanced or modified assays and platforms for detecting\nH7N9 AIVs are under investigation, such as modified surface plasmon resonance,39 enzyme-induced metallization,164 reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,165 and chip-based biosensors.166",
