Despite the obvious reasons for use as a supportive measure, very little data exists on the role of suctioning in the management of patients with bronchiolitis. A retrospective cohort study published in 2013 (Mussman et al. 2013 ) assessed the relationships between frequency and type of suctioning with LOS. The authors hypothesized that repeated nasopharyngeal suctioning (\"deep\" suction), compared to noninvasive nasal suctioning, would lead to worse outcomes due to local trauma and that frequent noninvasive suctioning would improve outcomes. Infants 2-12 months of age were included with 740 infants in the device type cohort (deep vs noninvasive suctioning) and 695 infants in the suctioning lapse cohort. They excluded patients who were intubated, with a tracheostomy, admitted to the PICU, or who had a LOS less than 12 h and included only index admissions. The percentage of deep suctioning exposures in the first 24 h of admission were calculated and categorized into four ranges, and the data was analyzed using a multivariable model adjusted for inverse weighting of propensity to receive deep suctioning. For the suctioning lapse group, the number of sequential suctioning events separated by more than 4 h was counted for the first 24 h of admission. They found a statistically significant association of increased length of stay for the group that had deep suctioning in the first 24 h and for those with lapses greater than 4 h (mean difference 0.6 days and 1 day, respectively). While further studies are needed, this study suggests that aggressive nasopharyngeal (\"deep\") suctioning may prolong LOS, and patients benefit from frequent less aggressive nasal suctioning.

One of the implicated contributors to this rise in hospitalizations is the increased use of pulse-oximetry during this time (Schroeder et al. 2004 ). Oxygen saturation does not correlate with and is not a proxy for respiratory distress (Wang et al. 1992) , and yet it has been shown to be a main factor in the decision to admit and lengthening of LOS (Ralston et al. 2014; Schroeder et al. 2004; Cunningham and McMurray 2012) . Physiologically, when the oxygen saturation is 90%, it takes much higher elevations in the arterial pressure of oxygen to cause further increases in the saturation versus when the saturation is <90%, and increasing saturations above the 90% threshold has no clear clinical benefit (Ralston et al. 2014; Anaesthesia UK 2005) . Also, studies on healthy infants show that transient hypoxemia occurs commonly without apparent harm (Hunt et al. 1999) , and the intermittent hypoxemia that asthmatic children experience does not cause intellectual impairment or behavioral problems (Rivetveld and Colland 1999; Bender et al. 1987 ). Based on this data, both guidelines give the recommendation that providers may choose not to use oxygen in patients with oxyhemoglobin saturations equal to or higher than 90% (Ralston et al. 2014; Friedman et al. 2014) or use continuous pulse-oximetry in infants and children with bronchiolitis (Ralston et al. 2014) . More data has since been published that further supports this recommendation (Cunningham et al. 2015; McCulloh et al. 2015) . Cunningham et al. (2015) performed a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind equivalence study to see if the \u226590% target for infants with bronchiolitis was equivalent to the \u226594% target for illness resolution. To accomplish this, they randomly assigned one group of infants (307) to be connected to a modified oximeter that would display a measured value of 90% as 94%. Another group of infants (308) were placed on a standard oximeter that displayed the accurate measured values. Each group only received oxygen if the displayed value was <94%, as was the standard practice. They found that the \u226590% oxygen saturation target to be equally safe and effective as the \u226594% target with no difference between the groups in adverse events or escalation of care. The modified group also had a significantly shorter LOS and time on oxygen but fewer readmissions and no increase in postdischarge parental anxiety. In a multicenter, randomized, superiority trial, McCulloh et al. (2015) studied the effect of intermittent versus continuous pulse-oximetry use on LOS in nonhypoxemic bronchiolitis patients.

How to manage patients with a bacteremic UTI (same organism in urine and blood) and when to obtain a blood culture in patients with a UTI pose challenges that the current guidelines do not address. However, current evidence demonstrates that despite variability in management, there is little difference in clinical outcome (Roman et al. 2015; Schroeder et al. 2016) . Multiple studies have demonstrated that bacteremic UTIs occur infrequently with the prevalence decreasing with increasing age, and patients with and without bacteremia lack easily identifiable clinical differences (Hoberman et al. 1999; Honkinen et al. 2000; Schnadower et al. 2010; Newman et al. 2002) .

(Zaoutis et al. 2009 ) published the first of these large studies in 2009 looking at the degree of variation across hospitals in the use of early transition to oral antibiotics and whether there is an association between this therapy and treatment failure. The primary outcome of treatment failure was defined as rehospitalization within 6 months due to acute or chronic osteomyelitis, a potential complication of acute osteomyelitis, or a musculoskeletal surgical procedure. Secondary outcomes were rehospitalization within 6 months due to a catheter-related complication, an antibiotic-related adverse drug reaction, or any other reason. The authors obtained data on 1969 children 2 months to 17 years with acute osteomyelitis meeting inclusion criteria from 29 freestanding children's hospitals. Of these, 1021 had a central venous catheter (CVC) for prolonged IV antibiotics while 948 did not and were transitioned to oral antibiotics prior to discharge. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of demographics, site of infection, LOS, surgical intervention, infecting organism, disease severity, or inhospital antibiotic therapy. They found no difference in treatment failure between the groups (5% [54 of 1021] in the IV group, 4% [38 of 948] in the oral group). The authors also demonstrated significant variation across hospitals in the proportion of children who had a CVC for prolonged antibiotics ranging from 10% to 95%. Data from their secondary outcomes showed that children in the prolonged IV therapy group were more likely to have treatment-related complications (e.g. catheter related complications, antibiotic related complications), had a significantly higher readmission rate for antimicrobial complications, and had a significantly higher overall 6-month rehospitalization rate for any reason. The authors concluded that the two methods of treatment are equally effective, that early transition to oral therapy is associated with fewer complications, and that the results of the study should encourage hospitals to develop clinical practice guidelines and protocols for early transition to oral antibiotics and thus reduce practice variation (Zaoutis et al. 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15, "end": 35, "text": "(Zaoutis et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2225, "text": "(Zaoutis et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Oral Versus Intravenous Antibiotic Therapy"}, {"text": "While promising, the above study had significant limitations that may have partly contributed to the lack of widespread reduction in PICC use in favor of the oral treatment route among most hospitals. These limitations included its retrospective nature and lack of validation of the osteomyelitis diagnosis and treatment choice, adjustment for severity of illness, and information about reasons for readmissions and revisits. In 2015, Keren et al. (2015) published a subsequent study seeking to again compare the effectiveness and complication rates of the two treatment modalities (early transition to oral antibiotics vs prolonged IV antibiotics) while addressing some of Zaoutis et al.'s limitations. Treatment failure was again the primary outcome, which was defined as a revisit to the ED or rehospitalization for a change in the antibiotic or length of treatment, a switch from the oral to PICC route, a pathologic bone fracture, or a surgical procedure related to the infection (i.e. abscess drainage, debridement, bone biopsy, etc.). Secondary outcomes included a return ED visit or rehospitalization for antibiotic-or PICCrelated complications or a composite of these with treatment failure. This study also utilized administrative data from the PHIS database, but they supplemented it with additional clinical information from detailed, manual chart review, thus validating treatment allocation, outcomes, and covariates. This study also used within-and across-hospital full matching based on propensity scores to account for confounders at the hospital and patient levels. While still not as robust at avoiding confounders as a randomized trial, propensity based matching mimics an RCT by most closely comparing similar patients in both arms of the study. In addition, this study improves on the prior study by including children hospitalized between 2009-2012 when methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) was more prevalent (Keren et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 435, "end": 454, "text": "Keren et al.

In the stratified analyses, they did find that the risk for treatment failure was increased in children older than 5 years in the PICC group. However, having MRSA as the causative organism did not impact the outcome of treatment failure based on treatment route. For the secondary outcomes, 15% (158 of 1055) in the PICC group had a PICC-related complication. As such, the PICC group had a significantly higher risk of needing a return ED visit or hospitalization for an adverse event in any matched analysis. The across-hospital variation in the use of the PICC route to give antibiotics on discharge was again broad and ranged from 0% to 100%.

The methodology and evidence supporting this list was also later published in The Journal of Hospital Medicine (Quinonez et al. 2013 ). The list is heavily focused on respiratory illnesses, particularly bronchiolitis. This is not unexpected given the frequency of this diagnosis in the inpatient setting. The investigators encouraged hospital medicine practitioners to utilize this list as a guide to prioritize quality improvement projects. Indeed, the recommendation to limit pulse oximetry has led to at least one such project (Schondelmeyer et al. 2015) , and this recommendation was later incorporated into the 2014 AAP bronchiolitis guidelines (Ralston et al. 2014) (Table 12. 3).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 514, "text": "(Quinonez et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 912, "end": 939, "text": "(Schondelmeyer et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1053, "text": "(Ralston et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1054, "end": 1064, "text": "(Table 12.", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Choosing Wisely"}, {"text": "In 2014, some of the same authors involved in the Choosing Wisely campaign published a comprehensive review of overdiagnosis in pediatrics (Coon et al. 2014) .

Since the publication of this review, further evidence has given support to possible overdiagnosis. One clear example is overdiagnosis of hypoxemia in bronchiolitis. Since the 1980's the widespread use of portable pulse oximeters has seen a concomitant increase of up to 300% in admissions for bronchiolitis (Hasegawa et al. 2013) .
