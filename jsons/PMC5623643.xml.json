            "text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA transcripts that are not translated and are at least 200 nucleotides long. The current GENCODE release (version 26) has identified 15,787 lncRNA genes in the human genome, encoding 27,720 different transcripts, excluding transcribed pseudogenes (https://www.gencodegenes.org/stats/current.html) (Harrow et al., 2012). Only a few hundred of these lncRNAs have been functionally characterized to date, but it has become evident that this class of biomolecules includes central regulators of varied biological processes, such as the regulation of cellular proliferation, immunity, development and even nuclear organization (Atianand et al., 2017, Chaudhary and Lal, 2016, Goff and Rinn, 2015, Perry and Ulitsky, 2016, Pircher et al., 2014). Based on their genomic context, lncRNAs can be grouped into four simple classes: antisense RNAs, which are transcribed in the opposite direction of overlapping protein-coding genes; large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), which are not flanked by other genes in close proximity; intronic lncRNAs, which are encoded within an intron of a protein-coding gene; and overlapping lncRNAs, which contain a protein-coding gene within a lncRNA intron (Atianand et al., 2017, Spurlock et al., 2016). More complex classification schemes have also been proposed (Chen, 2016). Most lncRNAs are thought to be capped, polyadenylated, and spliced using the same cellular machinery as protein-coding transcripts, although distinct differences have been noted (Mukherjee et al., 2017, Schlackow et al., 2016, Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013). Depending on their mechanism of action, lncRNAs are located in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. While cytoplasmic lncRNAs tend to function as scaffolds for protein complexes or as microRNA \u201csponges\u201d, nuclear lncRNAs often aid or interfere with transcription in cis or in trans . For instance, nuclear lncRNAs have been reported to bind protein regulators of transcription and either guide them to their intended target site or act as a decoy to sequester them (Atianand et al., 2017, Goff and Rinn, 2015).",

Several viruses have been shown to encode lncRNAs in their genome, including both DNA and RNA viruses (Tycowski et al., 2015). Multiple groups have reported that the genome of HIV-1 is transcribed in the antisense direction to yield various lncRNA species (Kobayashi-Ishihara et al., 2012, Landry et al., 2007, Ludwig et al., 2006, Saayman et al., 2014). While the length of the identified transcripts differed between studies, there is evidence to suggest that at least some of these antisense RNAs may interfere with viral transcription by establishing repressive histone methylation at the 5\u2032 LTR (Kobayashi-Ishihara et al., 2012, Saayman et al., 2014, Zapata et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Beyond virally encoded lncRNAs, the expression levels of lncRNAs encoded by the host have been shown to be altered upon infection with a variety of viral pathogens (Fortes and Morris, 2015). Specific examples include influenza A virus (IAV), hepatitis C virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), human cytomegalovirus, and HIV-1 (Carnero et al., 2016, Chang et al., 2011, Hu et al., 2016, Ouyang et al., 2015, Peng et al., 2010, Peng et al., 2014, Trypsteen et al., 2016, Winterling et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Of the host-encoded lncRNAs reported to be differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, only nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and noncoding repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NRON) have been functionally characterized (Lazar et al., 2016). NEAT1 is a nuclear lncRNA which stabilizes paraspeckles and is believed thereby to sequester unspliced and singly spliced HIV-1 transcripts (Clemson et al., 2009, Sasaki et al., 2009, West et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013; Zolotukhin et al., 2003). Of note, NEAT1 expression has also been shown to enhance the expression of antiviral genes during infection with IAV and HSV-1, as well as after poly(I:C) treatment (Imamura et al., 2014). NRON, by contrast, is a cytoplasmic lncRNA that forms part of a high-molecular-weight complex including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a transcription factor of central importance to T-cell activation. NRON stabilizes the inactive form of NFAT, and correspondingly loss of NRON results in the hyperactivation of T cells (Macian, 2005, Sharma et al., 2011, Willingham et al., 2005). A complex interplay of HIV-1 and NRON has been described, where NRON levels are decreased early during infection by the protein Nef and increased by the late gene product Vpu (Imam et al., 2015). Recently, Li et al. (2016) demonstrated that NRON specifically induces the degradation of Tat and thus contributes to HIV-1 latency. Other lncRNAs that have been documented to be up-regulated in HIV-1-infected cells, such as MALAT1 and MIAT, have not been functionally analyzed in the context of infection.",

Furthermore, there was only limited overlap between the results of these studies, likely reflecting different experimental conditions (Imam et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013). In this report, we describe a meta-analysis of two independent RNA-seq studies of HIV-1-infected cells and show that, unexpectedly, only three lncRNAs are differentially expressed in both of these datasets (Chang et al., 2011, Mohammadi et al., 2013). Of those three candidates, LINC00173 exhibits the highest degree of evolutionary conservation. We demonstrate that both transcript variants of LINC00173 are indeed detectable in a variety of human cell lines, are located predominantly in the nucleus, and are up-regulated upon infection with HIV-1. While, somewhat surprisingly, loss of LINC00173 did not affect the viral replication cycle directly in cell culture, Jurkat T cells deficient for LINC00173 on average expressed higher levels of a subset of cytokines than control cells, while other cytokines remained unaffected. These data indicate a possible involvement of LINC00173 in the regulation of cytokine expression.",

Chang et al. (2011) infected SUP-T1 cells with the fully replication-competent HIV-1 isolate LAI and performed RNA-seq with samples harvested at 12 and 24 h p.i.. Using this dataset, we identified non-coding transcripts based on their Genbank classification. Transcripts with a fold change of \u2265 2 were considered differentially expressed. Twelve hours after infection, 21 non-coding transcripts were down-regulated, 3 were up-regulated (\nFig. 1A). At 24 h, 51 transcripts were down-regulated, while 71 had increased expression levels (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, only 10 transcripts were differentially expressed at both time points (Fig. 1C). Next, we filtered out snoRNAs, miRNAs, and non-coding transcript variants of protein-coding genes. The remaining transcripts comprised 8 large intergenic non-coding RNAs (LINCs), 9 uncharacterized lncRNAs, 9 antisense transcripts, 16 pseudogenes and 6 other transcripts, such as a miRNA polycistron (Fig. 1D). We further filtered these results using the findings of Mohammadi et al. (2013), who infected SUP-T1 cells with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 NL4-3 \u0394env/EGFP and performed RNA-seq with samples harvested every 2 h for 24 h. The processed RNA-seq data from that study have been made available via the dedicated online platform Patterns of Expression and Analysis of Clusters of HIV/Host interactions (PEACHi, http://www.peachi.labtelenti.org). After excluding pseudogenes and the transcripts in the \u201cother\u201d category, we queried the remaining 26 lncRNA transcripts from our analysis of the study by Chang et al. in PEACHi. Of these, only four were also identified as differentially expressed in PEACHi (11 were not differentially expressed and 11 were not catalogued). Two of those 4 transcripts were variants of one gene, LINC00173, identified by Genbank as a large intergenic non-coding RNA. The remaining 2 transcripts were both antisense RNAs, CCDC18-AS1 and MCM3AP-AS1 (\nTable 1).",

Transcript variant 1 (lnc173 TSV1) is encoded by 2 exons and 1597 nt long, transcript variant 2 (lnc173 TSV2) is encoded by 3 exons and reaches a length of 435 nt. The central section of TSV1 is particularly well conserved across species, with a substantially similar region present even in the chicken genome (\nFig. 2A). RNA-seq data from GM78 and K562 cells available in the UCSC Genome Browser indicate robust transcription and splicing (Fig. 2A) (Kent et al., 2002). Recorded histone modifications in multiple cell types are also consistent with expression, including histone H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 methylation marks near the transcriptional start site (Supplementary Fig. S2). DNase I hypersensitivity levels suggest an open chromatin conformation at this locus (Supplementary Fig. S2). All of these data point to active transcription of LINC00173. The predicted secondary structures of lnc173 TSV1 and TSV2 are drastically different, reflecting the minimal sequence overlap restricted to the first exon (Fig. 2B, C).",

(Zhang et al., 2004). Both lnc173 transcript variants were indeed up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner compared to uninfected control cells. The lncRNA MALAT1, which has also been reported to be induced upon HIV-1 infection, showed a dose-dependent increase of similar magnitude (Zhang et al., 2013). STAT1 mRNA levels remained unchanged (\nFig. 5A). Infection of the monocytic THP-1 cell line mirrored the results of HEK 293T infection in magnitude and dose dependence (Fig. 5B). Infection of Jurkat cells resulted in a reproducible but less pronounced increase in lnc173 expression (Fig. 5C). This was expected, as the efficiency of infection for this cell type ranged only from 50% to 70%, whereas the qRT-PCR analysis reflected the average mRNA levels of both uninfected and infected cells (cf. Supplementary Fig. S3C). Infection efficiency for HEK 293T cells, by contrast, reached nearly 100% (cf. Supplementary Fig. S4B). To determine the temporal kinetics of lnc173 expression during viral replication, we infected HEK 293T cells in a 48-h time course and harvested samples every 12 h. Levels of lnc173 TSV1 and TSV2 were increased compared to time-matched controls at 12 h and 24 h p.i., followed by a decline towards control levels. Expression levels of MALAT1, by contrast, continued to increase throughout the entire time course (Fig. 5D). Exposure to heat-inactivated viral particles did not result in an increase of lnc173 expression (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data establish that HIV-1 infection does induce an increase in the cellular levels of lnc173 TSV1 and TSV2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and in multiple cell lines representing several cell types.",

            "text": "To determine whether either transcript variant of lnc173 is involved in an important part of the HIV-1 life cycle, we used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion to remove the entire LINC00173 gene in Jurkat cells. Specifically, we targeted both ends of the gene with separate guide RNAs simultaneously, derived monoclonal lines from the population and identified clones with no remaining copies of LINC00173 by PCR. Two separate combinations of guide RNAs were used, set 4 and set 12 (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 6 lnc173 knock-out (KO) clones was obtained, 2 with set 4 and 4 with set 12. Additionally, 4 control clones were derived from Jurkat cells transfected with an sgRNA-free Cas9 vector. The absence of lnc173 transcripts was confirmed by qRT-PCR (\nFig. 6A, B and Supplementary Fig. S3A, B). The residual signal detected with lnc173 KO clone 12\u201317 was close to the limit of detection but may reflect incomplete deletion of the gene. We then proceeded to systematically probe all parts of the HIV-1 replication cycle. To assess the post-entry steps of replication up to viral gene expression, we infected lnc173 KO cells or controls with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 NL4-3 \u0394env/EGFP. This construct carries the gene encoding EGFP in the open reading frame of the env gene and thus serves as a reliable reporter for the efficiency of reverse transcription, nuclear import, integration and expression of viral gene products (Zhang et al., 2004). A defect at any of these steps would result in a lower number of GFP+ cells and/or a lower level of GFP expression overall, and enhancement would result in the opposite phenotype. As expected with a collection of monoclonal lines derived from a heterogeneous parent population, the percentage of GFP+ cells and the intensity of GFP expression varied considerably between the clones (Supplementary Fig. S3C, D). However, the average values obtained for the 6 lnc173 KO clones and for the 4 control clones were remarkably similar and gave no indication of a defect or enhancement (Fig. 6C, D). Analogously, we created two monoclonal HEK 293T-derived cell lines with complete deletion of LINC00173 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). When these lines were infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 NL4-3 \u0394env/EGFP, the percentage of GFP+ cells and GFP levels were also indistinguishable from two control lines (Supplementary Fig. S4B, C). Next, we tested whether viral infectivity or particle release might be affected by the absence of lnc173. We produced fully infectious HIV-1 NL4-3 particles in the HEK 293T lnc173 KO clone 11-2B3 and compared yield and infectivity to virus produced in HEK 293T control clone 1B5. Stocks produced from both cell lines yielded similar concentrations of viral particles, demonstrating that virion production and release were unaffected by deletion of LINC00173 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). When virus from these stocks, normalized for p24 content, was used to infect the TZM-bl reporter cell line to determine infectivity, no difference was detectable (Fig. 6E) (Derdeyn et al., 2000, Platt et al., 1998). To understand whether the presence of lnc173 influences viral growth over multiple rounds of replication, we infected 4 Jurkat lnc173 KO clones and 4 control clones with fully replication-competent HIV-1 NL4-3 and tracked viral replication over a period of three weeks. While results varied between the clones of each group, no clear defect or enhancement was associated with the deletion of LINC00173 (Fig. 6F). Infection of the same clones with virus produced in lnc173-deficient HEK 293T cells yielded a highly similar growth curve (Supplementary Fig. S5B). These results demonstrate that both transcript variants of lnc173 are dispensable for replication of HIV-1 in cell culture.",

            "text": "HIV-1 replicates efficiently only in activated cells, and consequently has evolved multiple redundant mechanisms to increase the state of cellular activation in its host cell (Alexander et al., 1997, Fenard et al., 2005, McDougal et al., 1985, Postler and Desrosiers, 2012, Simmons et al., 2001, Stevenson et al., 1990, Zack et al., 1990, Zagury et al., 1986). We therefore investigated whether the increase in lnc173 levels was associated with general T-cell activation. Surprisingly, stimulation of Jurkat T cells with PMA and ionomycin resulted in a marked decrease in the levels of lnc173 TSV1 and TSV2 (\nFig. 7A). Similarly, RNA levels of a previously unknown, likely lnc173 ortholog in the mouse genome decreased upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin in EL4 cells, indicating at least some degree of evolutionary conservation of this mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly, the lnc173 KO Jurkat clones on average expressed higher levels of mRNA encoding a subset of cytokines than the cognate control lines. Specifically, average mRNA levels of IFNG, CCL3 and CXCL8 upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin were significantly higher in lnc173 KO clones than in control clones, whereas mRNA levels of IL2 and TNF did not differ (Fig. 7B and Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Due to the central role of IFN-\u03b3 in the differentiation of naive T cells into TH1 cells during the immune response to viral and other intracellular infections, we tested whether the observed increase in IFNG mRNA translated into an increase in IFN-\u03b3 protein levels secreted by lnc173 KO clones (Schoenborn and Wilson, 2007). Indeed, the average concentration of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant of lnc173 KO Jurkat clones was modestly but reproducibly elevated compared to the average of control clones, consistent with the mRNA results (Fig. 7C and Supplementary Fig. S7F). Although there was considerable variability between the clones of each group, these results raise the intriguing possibility that lnc173 may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of a subset of cytokines. Further studies are under way to address this question in detail.",

            "text": "Of the thousands of lncRNAs expressed in the human body, the vast majority remains uncharacterized, in particular in the context of viral infections. Until the recently published microarray study by Trypsteen et al., all reports investigating the effect of HIV-1 infection on lncRNA expression scrutinized only a small panel of previously characterized lncRNAs and thus, while yielding important insights, were limited in scope (Imam et al., 2015, Trypsteen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2013). To our knowledge, this is the first study using RNA-seq data to address specifically this aspect of the HIV-1 life cycle, although others have touched on the subject (Peng et al., 2014). To minimize the effect of interexperimental variability, we utilized two separate data sets created by two independent groups and employing two different strains of HIV-1 (Chang et al., 2011, Mohammadi et al., 2013). The finding that only three lncRNAs exhibited differential expression in both studies is somewhat surprising, especially considering that Trypsteen et al. (2016) found 328 lncRNA-coding genes to be altered (including those identified in this study, namely LINC00173, CCDC18-AS1 and MCM3AP-AS1). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but it may stem from the inherent differences between RNA-seq and microarray technology. Individual lncRNA expression levels tend to be lower than mRNA levels, and while microarrays afford a lower dynamic range than RNA-seq, they provide higher accuracy of quantification for low-abundance transcripts (Derrien et al., 2012, Jiang et al., 2011; \u0141abaj et al., 2011; Ravasi et al., 2006; Toung et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011). Additionally, using two independent data sets is likely to reduce the number of false positives but increase the number of false negatives.",

            "text": "\nLINC00173, a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, is conserved amongst mammals and at least a partial homolog appears to be present in chickens. As cross-species conservation is often an indicator of functional importance, we chose to further investigate the role of LINC00173 during HIV-1 infection. The experimental results presented here clearly demonstrate that its two transcript variants are robustly expressed in various human cell types, in accordance with the available in silico data. Consistent with the data mined from the studies by Chang et al. (2011), Mohammadi et al. (2013), and Trypsteen et al. (2016), lnc173 TSV1 and TSV2 are up-regulated during the course of HIV-1 infection. This effect is dose- and, more importantly, time-dependent. The observation that lnc173 TSV1 and TSV2 levels increase within the first 12 h after infection, remain increased at 24 h, but then decrease progressively towards baseline at 36 and 48 h, indicates targeted control of expression. Nonetheless, loss of the LINC00173 locus does not affect any aspect of the HIV-1 replication cycle in cell culture, from entry to particle production. Based on their nuclear localization, lnc173 TSV1 and/or TSV2 are likely involved in transcriptional regulation, but their precise role in this process, if any, remains unclear. It is conceivable that lnc173 may contribute to the regulation of viral transcription only under specific conditions, such as entering or exiting viral latency \u2013 an intriguing possibility that remains to be explored.",

Activation of T cells by exposure to PMA and ionomycin, which increases the expression of several cytokines, decreases the levels of both lnc173 transcript variants, opening up the possibility that lnc173 TSV1 and/or TSV2 may be negative regulators of cytokine expression. Indeed, upon activation the monoclonal Jurkat cell lines deficient for the LINC00173 locus on average produced higher mRNA levels of several cytokines than cognate controls, lending preliminary support to this hypothesis. Ongoing experiments outside the scope of this study will further explore the role of LINC00173 in cytokine regulation.",

            "text": "In this context, it is also interesting to note that the expression levels of both lnc173 transcript variants are increased during HIV-1 infection but decreased during T-cell activation, even though HIV-1 has evolved several independent mechanisms to induce the activation of host cells (Alexander et al., 1997, Fenard et al., 2005, Postler and Desrosiers, 2012, Simmons et al., 2001). This unexpected antagonistic phenotype may imply a specific function of lnc173 to be exploited or blunted by HIV-1. Of note, the cytokines exhibiting increased expression in the lnc173 KO Jurkat clones include IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine of central importance to the development and maintenance of the adaptive immune response to intracellular pathogens, including viruses (Schoenborn and Wilson, 2007). It is therefore tempting to speculate that HIV-1 has evolved the ability to increase levels of lnc173 to impede the immune response.",
