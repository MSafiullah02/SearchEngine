Another compartmental epidemic model SEIR [8] forecast for few countries and the impact of the quarantine on the COVID-19 is investigated. A better adaptive and improved version of the SIR model is illustrated in [9] . In this method, the time dependency of some parameters used for the analysis makes it more robust than the conventional SIR method.

The SIPHERD model is put for trial for the data of South Korea and Germany, and with a limited number of days data, the model is found to correctly predict the known evolution. The prediction for India suggests that even increasing the rate of infection transmission by 20% due to relaxation of lockdown leads to around 50k increase in the total number of cases and 3k increase in total deaths. The prediction for the USA shows that in the absence of vaccine the infection can last long till the end of this year and number of deaths could be around 250k if lockdown and social distancing conditions remain the same.",
