Quick and accurate disease models may answer critical questions that can potentially save lives and protect economies. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 had a drastic affect on tourism, food and travel, costing China 8.5 and Canada 4.3 billion US dollars (Beutels et al., 2009). Another example is given by Meltzer et al. (1999) who estimated the economic impact of a future influenza pandemic in the United States at 71.3 to 166.5 billion US dollars.",

Collection of such data is expensive and there are issues regarding recall and privacy encroachment. A connection, or a contact between two individuals, is usually deemed to be any contact between individuals by which the disease can spread from an infected individual to a susceptible individual. The connections themselves can be hard to describe, as researchers must quantify the type of relationship or contact needed for infection to transfer (Keeling and Eames, 2005). The networks may be social in nature, spatial proximity based, or demographic (Kolaczyk et al., 2009). For example, a network may be defined by sexual activity between two individuals in the case of a sexually transmitted disease. Alternatively, if trying to model the spread of the Norwalk virus in people, we might use knowledge about which individuals live together in the same house, attend the same schools, or work together, etc. If modeling a livestock disease at the level of individual farms, say, we may want data on the trade networks, supply networks, and even social networks of farmers and farm workers.",

For example, we may use a spatial network, rather than a more desirable trade network. Examples of such spatial simplification can be found in a number of models of the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic (Chis Ster and Ferguson, 2007, Chis Ster et al., 2009, Deardon et al., 2010, Keeling et al., 2001). Plant epidemiologists often make such simplifications as their subjects are generally stationary thus allowing infective pressures to decrease exponentially with distance (exponential decay), with a power of distance (geometric decay) or with a nearest neighbor effect (Beutels et al., 2009, Filipe and Maule, 2004). A piecewise function, similar in concept to the nearest neighbor effect only with a given probability of infection from a long distance source, has also been used in modeling wildlife infectious diseases in which a physical barrier (such as a river) reduces mixing within the population (Smith et al., 2005). The simplest assumption to make for any infectious disease model is to assume homogeneous mixing within the population thereby, with no other covariate information, assuming equal infective pressure on all individuals within the population. Bansal et al., 2007 provides insight into the ability of homogeneous-mixing compartmental model\u2019s ability to predict the characteristics of network-based epidemics.",

The first criterion is carried out by a comparison of the one-step ahead probability of infection under the posterior mean of each of the fitted models with that of the true model. This is carried out as follows for a given fitted model. In an otherwise susceptible population, six individuals are randomly infected in an area within the centre of the population, corners of the area being given by coordinates (10,10), (10,18), (18,10), and (18,18). These infectious individuals make up the set \u0394I. The set \u0394S contains the remaining 619 individuals not in \u0394I. The probability of infection at the next time point is then calculated via the network model of (3), with \u03b1=0.4, for the susceptible individuals, \u0394S. Let PiT be this true probability of infection with(10)PiT=1-exp-\u03b1\u2211j\u2208\u0394Icij,where cij is the true contact network. Infection probabilities for the susceptible individuals, \u0394S, are then calculated under the various models using their respective posterior mean estimates (and the true contact network for the network ILM). The posterior mean value used is based only on the individual epidemic replication under consideration. Let PiF be the probability of infection of individual i\u2208\u0394S under the fitted model.

The final \u0398(F) reported is an average over all ten epidemic replicates. A model which has a smaller \u0398(F) is considered to be a better fitting model.

However, when contacts occur over longer distances, the spatial models tend to perform poorly. If the probability of a long-distance contact is relatively high (i.e. eout=0.2 in study one, or n and/or SS are high in study two), it seems that each of the spatial models performed roughly as poorly as each other, with perhaps a slight preference for the constant piecewise model. Model fit results were not surprising given the mechanics of the simulation. Essentially in the first study, a piecewise function was used for the contact network generation and as such the constant piecewise model would be expected to approximate this aspect well. In the case of the second study, the homogeneous mixing model showed improved results when the super-spreader information overpowered the underlying spatial decay. The super-spreader aspect of the contact network is random and therefore would be best approximated by the homogeneous mixing model.",

When the radius parameter (\u03c4) of the piecewise kernel is outside the bounds of the possible infection distances observed (i.e. \u03c4\u21920 or \u03c4\u2192\u221e). Preliminary model fit of the constant piecewise model utilized a vague prior of a positive half-normal distributions with a mode of zero and variance of 1000 for \u03c4. The resulting MCMC chain would often converge to a homogeneous mixing model case. For the purpose of this simulation study we wanted to force the constant piecewise model to be fitted and thus restrict the radius (\u03c4) parameter from extremely low or high values. The use of an informative prior, as described in Section 2.9, applied this restriction. Of course, such MCMC convergence issues are indicative of model uncertainty. In the case of a real data analysis, researchers may want to explore this model uncertainty and could do so using techniques such as reversible jump MCMC to explore the joint parameter and model space (Richardson and Green, 1997).",

It would be interesting to analyze the results of using the various spatial ILMs for different types of more complex networks. For example, contact structure could be a function of several sub-networks. An example of this might be given by considering influenza for human populations in which different networks describe contacts from living in the same household, attending the same school/workplace, visiting the same general practitioners, and so on.",

We therefore purposefully avoided using a specific application. Of course, when modeling a real life outbreak and specific disease system, the model to be fit will need to be tailored to the data collected, as well as the underlying disease system. We have seen that the performance of the simple spatial disease transmission models can break down easily under various scenarios when the underlying contact structure is more complex. Optimal model fit is achieved when the structure of the model incorporates the characteristics of the disease spread; this includes the contact network. If modeling a wildlife epidemic, steps must be taken to determine how the mixing is occurring. At a spatial level this may mean incorporating aspects describing within herd dynamics, immigration and emigration rates, physical barriers to movement, and peak times of activity. With airborne pathogens spread to plants, models highlighting the spatial decay may indeed be adequate but could be improved upon if windspeed and other weather characteristics were also taken into account. Perhaps the overriding lesson to be drawn from the results shown here is the importance of putting in place a policy of procedures to collect high quality network (and other) data from the system of interest.",
