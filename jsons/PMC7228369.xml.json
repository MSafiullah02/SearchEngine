Ribavirin is a broad\u2010spectrum nucleoside antiviral drug; however, the clinical effects are unclear, and side effects should be considered. Regarding chloroquine, there were 15 interventional studies and its derivatives were prospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry; and further observations need to be evaluated regarding antiviral effect and recommended dose in patients infected with COVID\u201019. In addition to antiviral drugs, glucocorticoids should be used carefully and in a timely manner in patients with COVID\u201019. Extracorporeal support (ALS and ECMO) should be considered under strict indications and contraindications; otherwise, the waste of resources and additional complications will be enormous. ECMO may be used more aggressively and many more ECMO devices could be transferred to Hubei Province in the future due to the temporary absence of effective antiviral drugs and the hope of reducing mortality.
