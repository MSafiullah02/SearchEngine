            "text": "Carbonaceous and carbon-based nanomaterials have been attracting a significant research interest because of their exclusive characteristics, including good biocompatibility, non-toxicity, high mechanical/thermal properties, and relative ease of functionalization (Iravani 2011; Iravani and Varma 2019a, b; Mohammadinejad et al. 2016, 2019; Varma 2012, 2014a, b, 2016, 2019). Carbon dots are referred to as fluorescent carbon due to their strong characteristics which up on comparison with the traditional fluorescent dyes exhibit superior fluorescence including photostability, resistance to photobleaching and non-blinking (Xu et al. 2004). Additionally, carbon dots have promising characteristics, including water solubility, low toxicity, high chemical stability, easy derivatization. Due to all these unique traits, carbon dots have found important and widespread applications in biotechnology, energy, catalysis, biological labeling, bioimaging, and gene/drug delivery (Fig. 1 and Table 1) (Baker and Baker 2010; Shen et al. 2012; Cao et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2009a; Wang et al. 2013b). For instance, thermally reduced carbon dot-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor was fabricated for sensitive, cost-effective, simple, and selective determination of vitamin B12 (~ 1\u201312 \u03bcg ml\u22121) in aqueous solutions (Wang et al. 2015a). Additionally, uniform oxygen and sulfur co-doped graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots were produced with significant blue photoluminescence, and good stability which can be applied for cellular imaging with acceptable biocompatibility, and exhibited potential as fluorescent probe for bioimaging and biosensing purposes (Lu et al. 2015).",

Surface passivation is usually attained by the production of a thin insulating layer of oligomeric polyethylene glycol on an acid-treated carbon dot surface; high fluorescence intensities and high quantum yield of carbon dots can be achieved with an effective surface passivation (Lim et al. 2015). For instance, carbon quantum dots were prepared with quantum yields as high as 60% via passivation with polyethylene glycol1500N (Wang et al. 2010). Additionally, polyethylenimine (Liu et al. 2012), boronic acid (Shen and Xia 2014), NH2-polyethylene-glycol and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2010) have been applied for functionalizing carbon dots for application in gene delivery and bioimaging, blood sugar sensing and Hg(II) sensing (Liu et al. 2016).",

The top-down approaches, by which carbon dots are generally formed through the chemical or physical cutting procedures of relatively microscopic carbon structures, comprise arc discharge (Xu et al. 2004), laser ablation/passivation (Yang et al. 2009b; HU et al. 2009a, 2009b; Li et al. 2010b), electrochemical synthesis, (Ming et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2007), and chemical oxidation (Qiao et al. 2010); most common representative sources for these techniques being carbon nanotube and graphite. Some drawbacks of top-down approaches for synthesizing carbon quantum dots are the requirements of expensive materials and setups, harsh reaction conditions, and longer reaction times (Sharma and Das 2019).",

Additionally, the other preparative strategies have been suggested, including plasma treatment (Jiang et al. 2009), supported synthesis (Bourlinos et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Zong et al. 2011), solution chemistry approaches (Wang et al. 2011a; Hamilton et al. 2011; Mueller et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011), and cage-opening of fullerenes (Lu et al. 2011). The produced carbon dots, regardless of their production techniques, have a mix of sizes, which needs complex separation techniques to obtain mono-dispersed carbon dots. Some of the explored post-synthesis separation techniques include dialysis (Liu et al. 2007), chromatography (Li et al. 2010a; Vinci et al. 2012), gel electrophoresis (Tao et al. 2012), and ultra-filtration (Zheng et al. 2013).",

Furthermore, alterations in fluorescence of carbon quantum dots were applied for detecting various numbers of inorganic molecules (Pooja et al. 2017). As an example, the detection of NO2 gas was achieved by using quantum dot-functionalized aerogels as the sensing probes wherein they revealed significant fluorescence activities in the solid state. The fluorescence was quenched by NO2 gas, while no quenching was detected when the carbon quantum dot-functionalized aerogels were exposed to a pure nitrogen atmosphere (Wang et al. 2013c).",

For instance, in vitro studies have revealed the low cytotoxicity of graphene quantum dots, which was credited to their significant oxygen content and ultra-small size. Additional in vivo biodistribution assay using mice showed no graphene quantum dots accumulations in the main organs and fast clearance of graphene quantum dot via kidney. Notably, injections with graphene quantum dot and graphene oxide showed that graphene quantum dots had no noticeable influences on mice; differently, the graphene oxide revealed some toxicity, even initiating death because of the in vivo aggregations of graphene oxide. In another study, the effect of functional groups on the cytotoxicity of graphene quantum dots was ascertained by comparing their ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Consequently, it was revealed that ketonic carbonyl groups had noticeable effect on reactive oxygen species formation ability of graphene quantum dots. Thus, removing oxygen functional groups on graphene quantum dots could improve the photostability and reduce the cytotoxicity, which provided molecular level indication for the better design of biocompatible graphene quantum dots. Because of their remarkable biocompatibility, graphene quantum dots with a large number of oxygen-containing groups were effectively applied as operative nano-radio-sensitizer for radiotherapy.",

(Jiang et al. 2014) reported the presence of photoluminescence carbon dots from commercial Nescafe instant coffee with the size of 4.4 nm and quantum yield about 5.5%; coffee-derived carbon dots have been directly applied in the imaging of carcinoma cells and small guppy fish without functionalization. Carbon dots passivated with PPEI-EI for two-photon luminescence microscopy were used to image human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Cao et al. 2007); carbon dots showed bright photoluminescence both on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm after 2 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C wherein the cellular uptake of carbon dots was temperature-dependent with no internationalization observed at 4 \u00b0C. Zhu et al. (2014) prepared a two-photon \u201cturn-on\u201d fluorescent probe, which was then used for imaging hydrogen sulfide in live cells and tissues.",

Lee et al. (2014) confirmed the delivery of doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo using carbon dots; doxorubicin was loaded on carbon dots via electrostatic interactions with 95% loading efficiency and induced death of HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cells as well as tumor in mice. Further, pure carbon dots preferably labeled the nucleus, whereas carbon dots loaded with doxorubicin were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. A smart stimuli-response drug delivery system comprising carbon dots and alginate was suggested where carbon dots, coated on the surface of alginate beads and garlic extract containing allicin, was taken as model drug system (Majumdar et al. 2016); the amount of garlic extract loaded on alginate beads coated with carbon dots was 60% higher than uncoated alginate beads.

These findings inspired researchers to substitute presently applied antiviral agents (such as ribavirin and interferons), recognized to have major side effects, including short-term memory loss, deficits in decision-making functions, confusion, and extrapyramidal influences.

Apparently, these carbon dots could selectively interact with the Gram-positive bacteria, get adsorbed, and their fluorescence emission being accelerated remarkably. The carbon dot adsorption could destruct the bacterial cell surface, as these carbon dots changed the charge balance of the bacterial surface and were inserted into the bacterial surface through the long alkyl chains leading to the bacterial inactivation.

This selective fluorosensor showed high sensitivity toward Hg2+ with a detection limit of 8.6 nM and was practically used for the effective detection of Hg2+ in river-water samples (Shi et al. 2015a). An eco-friendly approach to prepare N-graphene quantum dots with a high quantum yield of 28.10% has been described which showed strong blue fluorescence emission with the maximum emission and excitation at 450 nm and 355 nm, respectively. Taking advantage of the effective quenching effect of Hg2+ on N-graphene quantum dots, they were developed for the efficient and sensitive detection of Hg2+ with a relatively low detection limit of 0.032 \u03bcM. Based on the selective coordination of biothiols and Hg2+, the fluorescence of the N-graphene quantum dot/Hg system was recovered with the addition of biothiols. This fluorescent \u201cOff\u2013On\u201d process displayed a sensitive response to biothiols with a detection limit of 0.036 \u03bcM for cysteine and 0.034 \u03bcM for glutathione. The N-graphene quantum dot-based fluorescence method has been successfully used to monitor Hg2+ in real water samples and biothiols in serum samples (Yan et al. 2016).",

Drug delivery systems based on arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-conjugated graphene quantum dots were applied in load of doxorubicin (an antitumor drug) for targeted imaging and drug delivery. Indeed the characteristic stable fluorescence of graphene quantum dots permitted the real-time analyses of the cellular uptake from the produced nanoassembly and the following doxorubicin drug release. The doxorubicin releasement showed significant pH dependence and implied hydrogen-bonding interaction between graphene quantum dots and doxorubicin; the graphene quantum dots can be served as pH-sensitive drug carriers (Dong et al. 2018). Compared to free doxorubicin, the prepared conjugates revealed remarkable cytotoxicity effects to U251 glioma cells within diverse range of doxorubicin concentrations. Findings form the cellular uptake of these conjugates demonstrated that doxorubicin and some graphene quantum dots have entered into cell nuclei after incubation (~ 16 h). These combinational enhancements with suitable nuclear delivery enhanced the doxorubicin cytotoxicity effects, noticeably (Dong et al. 2018). Additionally, the prepared folic acid-conjugated graphene quantum dots could be applied for loading of doxorubicin, real-time evaluating of cellular uptake and the consequent drug release. This prepared nanoassembly was precisely internalized promptly by HeLa cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas doxorubicin release and accumulations were sustained. In vitro toxicity studies revealed that the produced nanoassembly targeted HeLa cells differentially and efficiently while showing meaningful decrease in cytotoxicity on non-target cells (Wang et al. 2014b).",

Targeted tumors imaging based on graphene quantum dots has been reported in vivo, infrequently. The subsequent forms of cancer diagnostic agents applied for small animals require enhanced accumulations in tissues of tumors. The functionalization of graphene quantum dots with peptides or antibodies for imaging with high cancers targeting issues should be additionally investigated. The optimization of emission characteristics and multi-photon excitations of graphene quantum dots, their innovative neurobehavioral analyses applications, the brain gene therapy, and brain barrier penetration through blood capillaries, should be scrutinized (Dager et al. 2019; Sharma and Das 2019; Wang et al. 2014a; Namdari et al. 2017). The side effects, which possibly can be detected by applying graphene quantum dots, need to be evaluated. The gene expression and toxicity as well as cytotoxicity evaluations of graphene quantum dots with various surface coatings, morphologies and sizes should be assessed; the biodistribution analyses of graphene quantum dots in different animal models are essential (Wang and Hu 2014; Huang et al. 2019b; Zhu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014a; Namdari et al. 2017).",

            "text": "One of the important challenges is to optimize the production methodologies and improve the control over the sizes and morphologies of the produced particles; standardization of the fabrication processes should be accomplished. Considerable important variations exist with significant results on the carbon-based sensors functions and their related biocompatibility. Because, the fluorescence characteristics and quantum yields are associated with the inclusive composition and the existence of remaining chemical groups on the carbon and graphene quantum dots surfaces, this standardization is significantly essential. Optimized synthetic strategies are crucial for scaling up the processes, and in this context, applying simple, greener, environmentally friendly and cost-effective techniques are very critical. Using synthetic approaches that rely on renewable starting materials is remarkably interesting and requires investigations for commercial and scale-up production. On the other hand, applying synthetic methods at lower temperatures (low-energy input) using earth-abundant starting ingredients is still an important challenge for researchers in the field. Photoluminescence is one of the extremely attractive characteristics of carbon and graphene quantum dots, but these properties are highly dependent on the raw materials deployed in fabrication and the presence of surface functionalities on these particles which are noticeable in the case of carbon quantum dots from organic molecules and biomass. Most importantly, one of the lingering challenges has been to improve and develop the quantum yield of carbon quantum dots while taking full advantage of their intrinsic characteristics and to fine-tune their emission spectrum; the improvement in carbon quantum dots with strong fluorescence emission is crucial for biomedical imaging without harmful effects (Liu et al. 2017b; Wang et al. 2016b; Murugan et al. 2019; Halder et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; de Menezes et al. 2019; Barras et al. 2016; Nekoueian et al. 2019; Li et al. 2015; Mei et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2014).",

Innovative fluorescent characteristics and the means of controlling these properties are hurdles for regulating the luminescent mechanism and the construction approach. The synthesis tactic, crystalline structure, non-quantitative surface structure, nano-size effect, and virtual size polydispersion are closely related to the luminescence mechanism, which can be resolved by careful evaluation, precise synthesis, and intelligent analysis. Future investigations should focus on the enhancement of quantum yield, biocompatibility, and synthesis approaches that should encompass green, eco-friendly, low-energy, low-cost, simple, and efficient routes, suitable nano-size, and compositional and structural alterations (Huang et al. 2019b; Iravani and Varma 2020).",

Simple strategies providing feasible methods toward the commercial high yield production of carbon and graphene quantum dots are needed using cheap material sources, greener reagents under mild conditions. Although various approaches have been suggested for producing carbon and graphene quantum dots, well-defined structure and precise sizes are barely available yet (D\u2019souza et al. 2018; Kasibabu et al. 2015). It is vital to prepare quantum dots in a facile and greener manner with designed structure and size for proper investigations and biomedical applications. The synthetic routes and sources of carbon are important factors, which influence the sizes, morphologies and characteristics of the final product; the sizes for carbon dots are very crucial for understanding quantum phenomena, and also for biomedical applications and optoelectronics (Li et al. 2019).",

Though, discrete sustainable and greener synthetic approaches have been applied for synthesizing carbon quantum dots, investigations into graphene quantum dots are still at a growing stage, and more elaborate and critical studies are needed. As an example, the well-defined and atom-precise structures have not been reported comprehensively, thus restricting the profound evaluation of the relationships between structures and characteristics, detailed properties regulations, and comprehensive assessments of innovative synthetic approaches and applications. An all-inclusive consideration toward the optical characteristics of carbon dots is needed; additional theoretical evaluations and better understanding the mechanistic aspects are very critical.",

Indeed, quantum dots show significant potentials in such biomedical, bioimaging, and photoluminescent applications, and they can be harnessed as promising fluorescent probes for imaging with low cytotoxicity as they show remarkable potentials in bioanalysis and related fields. Carbon quantum dots have received widespread attentions owing to their suitable biocompatibility, robust chemical inertness and higher resistance to photobleaching.

It appears that considerable efforts should be expanded to find greener, simple, efficient, and eco-friendly fabrication methodologies for carbon and graphene quantum dots as well as their effective use in bio- and nano-medical applications.
