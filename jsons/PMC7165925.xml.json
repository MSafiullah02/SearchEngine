Sputum and blood culture samples were collected in over half of all patients, and NPA viral samples in over 90% of all patients. Serological test for viral and atypical pathogens, however, was carried out in only 14% of all patients. The low availability was explained by its limited usefulness in clinical management. First, NPA viral cultures are superior to serological tests in allowing a more accurate and rapid diagnosis of viral infections. Second, serological tests do not help in the immediate medical treatment, because empirical antibiotics for atypical bacterial pathogens might be started much earlier than the results of test are available. Third, serological tests require paired samples to be collected 10\u201314 days apart. The acute titers are collected shortly after admission, and the convalescence titers might not be collected because patients have recovered and been discharged. Despite their limitations, serological tests provide important epidemiological data on CAP caused by atypical pathogens (AP).

Our group has shown that in\u2010hospital mortality was related to pneumonia severity and patients' factors (comorbidities and nutritional status).15 The present study added that it was not related to the results of microbial investigation. Pneumonia severity represents the end result of adding numerous disease factors. In other words, it is pneumonia severity, but not infective cause, that determines the case mortality of pneumonia.",

We found that nursing home residence and absence of leukocytosis were independent predictors of viral pneumonia. Respiratory viruses were the most common infective cause of NHAP. In general, respiratory viruses have a higher infectivity than bacteria. We hypothesize that the over\u2010crowded living environment in nursing homes contributes to viral spreading among frail older people with multiple comorbidities. This is why outbreaks of influenza\u2010like illness, caused by viral but not bacterial infection, are commonly reported in the influenza peak seasons. This theory needs to be proven in future studies. Furthermore, we propose that NPA viral tests should be ordered for every nursing home patient admitted for CAP because of infection control in both hospital and nursing homes. In our hospital, the results of NPA immunofluorescence tests are available within 12 h after collection. Patients are hospitalized for isolation if their NPA viral tests are positive. Empirical antiviral agents, such as oseltamivir, might be added if outbreaks of influenza\u2010like illness are reported in nursing homes. This helps avoid spreading viral infection in both hospital and nursing homes.",

These viruses are rhinovirus, coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Rhinovirus can be isolated in viral culture, but not serology; whereas coronavirus and hMPV can be detected by serology, but not viral cultures. However, all these tests take time to yield a diagnosis and are not helpful in immediate clinical management. Real\u2010time PCR tests are able to detect all of these viruses within hours. Outbreaks of respiratory tract infections in long\u2010term care facilities caused by hMPV and rhinoviruses were reported.17, 18, 19 These PCR tests are not routine investigations. We suggest that real\u2010time PCR tests of nasopharyngeal specimens should be carried out in all nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP because of infection control in hospital and nursing homes.",
