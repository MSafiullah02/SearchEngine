The surfaces of the equipment (including the obstetric table, ultrasound machine, and neonatal warm bed) in the isolation delivery room and the negative-pressure delivery room need to be wiped and disinfected immediately, preferably with 1000 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant; 75% ethanol can be used for the non-corrosion resistance instruments 7, 9 . Spraying is not a recommended method of disinfecting the equipment as this can affect the components. ",
