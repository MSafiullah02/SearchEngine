            "text": "The design and synthesis of nucleoside analogues has been a subject of great interest in the discovery of novel anticancer and antiviral agents owing to the fact that they can be involved in the disruption of nucleic acid biosynthesis and thus inhibit cellular division and viral replication. [1] Additionally, they have been utilised for various gene-silencing techniques as constituents of antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNA-targeting oligonucleotides (anti-miRNAs). [2] In particular, conformationally restricted nucleosides such as \"locked nucleic acids\" (LNAs), whereby the sugar moiety of the nucleoside is locked in the bioactive C3'-endo (North) or C2'endo (South) conformations, represent an interesting class of nucleoside inhibitor as they can show a dramatic improvement in enzymatic recognition, as well as enhancing base stacking and backbone pre-organisation. [3] Most of these systems are locked by virtue of bridging groups on the furanose unit alone, but there are also examples whereby the nucleobase is directly involved in the conformational restriction of the nucleoside (so-called \"cyclonucleosides\"). [4] In this respect, we have an interest in the synthesis and use of anomeric spironucleosides, whereby the anomeric carbon belongs to both the sugar moiety and the nucleobase (Figure 1 ). This fixes the nucleobase in a specific orientation around the N-glycosidic bond, imposing an altered flexibility on the sugar moiety. Spiro-functionalised nucleosides have gained considerable interest with the discovery of (+)-hydantocidin (1), a natural spironucleoside with potent herbicidal and plant growth regulatory activity. [5] However, to the best of our knowledge, synthetic work in this field is limited, with the majority of anomeric spirocycles being hydantoine or diketopiperazine analogues, or simple pseudonucleosides with anchored purinic and pyrimidinic bases. [6] As part of an on-going programme within our laboratories on the synthesis of non-natural nucleic acids, [7] we aimed to prepare a library of spiro-fuctionalised nucleosides, containing a [1,2,3]-triazolyl moiety using a straightforward and highly stereoselective route. It was felt that this class of spironucleoside would make an interesting alternative to the [1,2,4]-triazolyl class of nucleoside the biological activity of which is well known, owing to their resemblance to ribavirin 2. [8] We therefore evaluated our resulting [1,2,3]-triazolospironucleosides for their anti-HMV (mouse hepatitis virus) activity in vitro.",

MHV was serially passaged eight times on 17Cl-1 cells, which had been pre-treated with 1 mm 3 f, a concentration that reproducibly reduced viral growth by about 90 %. Previous work on antiviral compounds suggested that these conditions were appropriate for the selection of drug-resistant coronavirus within about five passages. [20] However, MHV grown in the presence of 3 f consistently produced about 10 % of the virus produced in untreated control cells, and did not develop resistance (data not shown). These results suggest that the mechanism of action of 3 f is unclear, and that effects of 3 f on the cell cannot be ruled out as a potential explanation of the antiviral effects.",
