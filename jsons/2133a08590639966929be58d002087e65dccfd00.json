            "text": "Mass gatherings present the medical community with an excellent window of opportunity to study infectious diseases that can be transmitted over long distances. This is because the venue of a mass gathering usually does not change year-to-year. As a result, special attention can be given to the public health risks that are introduced by travelers from around the world into these mass gatherings. Travelers can also be infected with diseases that are endemic in the host country and transport the locally acquired infectious diseases to their home environments. Therefore, mass gatherings can be thought of as global-to-local-to-global events because of the initial convergence of global populations and the subsequent divergence of populations throughout the world. This chapter discusses three active areas of geographic research that have emerged from our understanding of disease surveillance at mass gatherings: the role of transportation and population geographies in disease surveillance; the spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental geography in the spread of disease; and the advances in GIScience that provide real-world surveillance and monitoring of disease and injuries at mass gatherings.",

Mass gatherings events can involve sporting events, religious, social, cultural, or political congregations, as well as gatherings of displaced populations due to natural disasters or confl ict.

First, since travel is a central and critical aspect of mass gatherings, a robust understanding of the spatial movements and interactions of certain populations is essential to assessing the health risks associated with a mass gathering event. The seasonality and timing of the mass gathering event are also crucial because public health risks are usually correlated with the temporal and spatial distribution of travelers to and from the city where the mass gathering event is hosted. Moreover, environmental and seasonal factors play a clinically relevant role in the infectious activity of pathogens with strong seasonal patterns (i.e., due to the effects of climate). Finally, in countries where public health surveillance and reporting infrastructures are often suboptimal, specialized and focused efforts -such as those on spatial data infrastructure and volunteered geographic information -are vital in the implementation of robust data gathering methods, enhanced analytic capabilities, and improved capacity for electronic disease surveillance [ 5 , 13 ] .",

Modern modes of transport -such as air, rail, train, and car -have enabled the number of people attending these gathering to increase, as well as the speed at which people travel to these events. Mass gatherings introduce a risk of the spread of infectious diseases, amongst other risks -such as burns, heat exhaustion, dehydration, trauma, human stampedes, and the potential for environmental and public health hazards. One of the largest single mass gatherings on Earth is the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela in India. It is believed that this festival likely contributed to the 1817-1824 Asiatic cholera pandemic. Pilgrims are thought to have carried the cholera bacteria from an endemic area in the lower Ganges to populations in the upper Ganges, from there to Kolkata and Mumbai, and across the subcontinent. Then, British soldiers and sailors transported the bacteria to Europe and to the Far East. The epidemic ended very abruptly in 1824, after a harsh and cold winter [ 14 , 15 ] . In 2013, the same Haridwar-based event attracted approximately 80 million pilgrims between January and April. It is estimated that at least 16 million people were present at the height of the festival on April 14 [ 16 ] . Despite much rapid monitoring and public health interventions, diarrheal diseases (such as cholera) continue to be a risk at these mass gatherings today.",

Communicable diseases include infections resulting from a number of different modes of transmission (such as respiratory, food, water, vector, and animal pathogens). Non-communicable diseases are diseases and injuries caused by extreme weather conditions (such as fl oods, high winds, and high temperatures), acute cardiovascular stress, human stampedes, and acts of terrorism. While most of the public health response at mass gatherings has been on communicable diseases (due to their potentially huge consequences), non-communicable diseases and injuries have actually caused more deaths and morbidity at mass gatherings [ 29 ] . The public health response to both groups of diseases is similar to that for public health emergencies or crises in which the existing infrastructure is inadequate for the sudden surge in demand. This section will address the importance of identifying the appropriate environmental, socio-economic, and health characteristics of the mass gathering events and their participants. The effects of infectious diseases at mass gatherings were fi rst noted for foodborne illnesses, arising from person-to-person transmission. Although the spread of infectious diseases has been reported in relation to the Hajj, the earliest and best modern examples were outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness [ 30 ] . Food-borne and water-borne outbreaks of infectious diseases have the potential to spread very rapidly and on a large scale. Factors that infl uence the spread of infectious diseases include: the types of infections that are endemic to the host country, the types of infections that are endemic to the home countries of the visitors, and the manner in which the populations mix and interact. These factors can be amplifi ed by the international travel and the subsequent dissemination in the home population -which is often faster than the incubation period of almost all infections. Furthermore, the spread of infection and drug-resistant organisms is expedited by the rapid mass movement and mixing of infectious and susceptible populations [ 14 ] . The infections that are likely to arise are also partly determined by the type of event -for instance, events with overcrowded accommodations will be more susceptible to outbreaks of respiratory infections, where as those with excessive consumption of recreational drugs and alcohol could increase the likelihood of sexually transmitted infections [ 31 ] .",

Tuberculosis is a respiratory infection with a long incubation time.

For instance, in 1998, an outbreak of leptospirosis was reported among triathlon athletes in Springfi eld, Illinois, USA, where 11 % of tested participants were positive for the infection. This large outbreak likely arose from athletes drinking contaminated lake water, and demonstrated that unusual infections can occur among those who come into contact with fresh water during mass gathering events in temperate countries [ 33 ] .",

Studies in Mecca have found that extreme environmental temperatures led to a major disaster -more than 1,000 deaths from heatstroke in just a few days [ 6 ] .

Travelers can also be infected with diseases that are endemic in the host country and can then transport locally acquired infectious diseases to their home environments, where they might then start new epidemics. Therefore, mass gatherings can be conceptualized as global-to-local-to-global events because of the initial convergence of global populations and the subsequent divergence of populations throughout the world. Three active areas of geographic research have emerged in our modern-day understanding of disease surveillance at mass gatherings: transportation and population geographies and their role in disease surveillance; the spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental geography in the spread of disease; and the ability of advances in GIScience to provide real-world surveillance and monitoring of disease and injuries.",

Advances in modern-day commercial travel -by air, land, and water -have profoundly transformed the global movement of populations throughout the world. More than two billion people travel on commercial air fl ights every year, and this phenomenon presents new opportunities for locally emerging infectious diseases to quickly transform into international epidemics or pandemics [ 46 , 47 ] . The accessibility of international modes of transportation has also contributed to an increase in the overall number, frequency, and scale of international mass gathering events. Since transportation and migration are central features of mass gatherings, transportation and population geographers can play a unique and essential role to our understanding of the spatial and temporal aspects of global outbreaks related to mass gatherings [ 48 -52 ] . Mass gathering events often involve one of four major population groups: participants, observers, residents, and bystanders. Participants are those directly participating in the events, such as pilgrims at a religious festival. Observers are spectators of an event. Residents are those in the host country who interact with participants at the mass gathering -such as food vendors and hotel staff. Bystanders are those who travel to the host country for reasons unrelated to the mass gathering, but interact with people in the mass gathering environment. Since the global origins, mobility, and infectious disease burdens differ for each population group, understanding each group's daily mobility and transportation patterns is essential to assessing the public health risks at a mass gathering event [ 5 ] .",

Considerations must also be given to the pre-departure health risks of each population group, their accommodations at the host country, and their interactions at the mass gathering event. For example, participants (i.e., political leaders and their entourages) of the G20 Summit would be expected to have low pre-travel risks of infectious disease, reside in privileged environments where food or water-borne diseases are unlikely, and be highly sequestered from other population groups at the mass gathering event. Conversely, pilgrims traveling to a religious mass gathering, such as the Kumbh Mela, may have pre-existing health issues, be living in environments where the risks of acquiring food or water-borne diseases are increased, and have extensive interactions with other population groups [ 5 ] .",

Disease ecology is the branch of medical geography that is concerned with the integration of the environmental and social aspects of human lives into an understanding of diseases and injuries [ 54 -57 ] . Since diseases obviously do not exist independently of environments or hosts, it is important to understand how human behavior, with its cultural and socioeconomic contexts, interacts with the environment to promote or prevent disease [ 58 ] . Anticipated (or unanticipated) disturbances in the environment -such as climate change, population growth, urbanization, and migration -can have either positive or negative effects on the incidence or spread of disease [ 59 ] . Medical geographer Dr. Melinda Meade recognized that human disease is the outcome of a complex and dynamic interaction between the internal and external environments of an individual or a population. She proposed a view of disease as being an intersection of three types of variables: population, environment, and behavior ( Fig. 3.1 ) . Population variables are factors that affect individuals' responses to disease as biological beings, such as nutritional and immunological status, age, and gender. Environmental variables are all aspects of the built, natural, and social environments that can affect disease outcomes. Behavior variables include both observable aspects of actions and culture, such as social organization, technology, diet, as well as less tangible variables like perceptions of risk. Disease outcomes are the result of place-and time-specifi c interactions among these variables [ 60 , 61 ] .",
