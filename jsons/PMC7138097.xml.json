Shortly after the initial worldwide outbreak in 2003, SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) was discovered as an etiological agent of SARS [Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003a], and then angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor of this newly arrived virus [Li et al., 2003]. More recently, CD209L was reported as being another alternative receptor for the virus, but it appears to be a less efficient entry site than ACE2 [Jeffers et al., 2004].",

For example, it is well known that genetic polymorphism of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a co\u2010receptor for human immunodeficiency virus\u20101 (HIV\u20101), influences the natural history of HIV\u20101 infection. The mutant allele CCR5\u2010\u039432 does not produce a functional protein and has been shown to protect host cells against HIV\u20101 infection, and progression into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is delayed after seroconversion takes place [Dean et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1996; Samson et al., 1996]. By analogy with the above, we considered that genetic polymorphisms of ACE2 could influence SARS\u2010CoV infection or clinical manifestations of SARS.",

Similar to ACE1, ACE2 is a metalloprotease that constitutes a renin\u2010angiotensin system. Human full\u2010length ACE2 cDNAs have been cloned already from lymphoma (GenBank accession No. AF241254) [Tipnis et al., 2000], cardiac left ventricle (AF291820) [Donoghue et al., 2000] and testis (AY623811) [Douglas et al., 2004]. Based on published data, it has been said that the ACE2 gene (ACE2) contains 18 exons, and spans approximately 40 kb of genomic DNA on the human X\u2010chromosome. Although ACE2 mRNA expressions were demonstrated in the lung by the method of quantitative reverse transcription\u2010PCR (RT/PCR) [Harmer et al., 2002] and its protein expression was obviously shown by immunohistochemistry [Hamming et al., 2004], full\u2010length ACE2 cDNA has not been cloned from the lung so far.

Because ACE2 is located to the X chromosome in humans, samples from both males and females were analyzed, respectively. Two possible non\u2010synonymous SNPs that are shown in the dbSNP database (rs4646116 and rs11798104) were not found in our samples this time. When the antibody\u2010negative contacts group was compared with antibody\u2010positive group including SARS cases in either males or females, no difference was observed between the two groups both in regards to genotype and allele frequencies. Comparison between antibody\u2010positive contacts and SARS cases, and comparison between contacts and non\u2010contacts did not show any significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of the tested polymorphisms.",

These are considered to be important replication sites of SARS\u2010CoV [Haagmans et al., 2004]. Both 5\u2032\u2010and 3\u2032\u2010ends of the intron between the new alternative exon and the original exon 1 followed the GT/AG rule of Breathnach and Chambon [1981]. Although the organ specificity of the transcripts was not confirmed in this study due to the limitation of non\u2010quantitative PCR amplification, implication of the new exon was definitely shown in the lung and small intestine. Also, we found the extended region of the original exon 1, 65 bp on the 5\u2032 side. Neither the new alternative exon nor the new extended region of exon 1 gave rise to a new coding region and they were considered as 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region.",

In that study, five intronic SNPs (rs2106809, rs2285666, rs4646142, rs714205, and rs2074192) were chosen and analyzed in a case\u2010control manner, based on the previously known exon\u2010intron structure and SNPs already registered in the database. By contrast, we attempted to analyze not only previously known SNPs but also variations newly identified among actual SARS patients and contacts. Based on the information from the exon\u2010intron structure of ACE2 cloned by ourselves, we searched for nucleotide sequences in all the exons including the new alternative exon and the corresponding 5\u2032\u2010flanking region, which are thought to contain promoters of the new exon and the original exon 1. We found one novel non\u2010synonymous substitution N638S and 18 non\u2010coding SNPs including two relatively common SNPs with minor allele frequency higher than 5%. We selected these SNPs and analyzed them furthermore in a case\u2010control manner, because, while they are rare occurrence, non\u2010synonymous substitution may directly modulate the function of the protein, and because relatively common SNPs can often be used as markers to ascertain a causative variation. Of 19 SNPs found in this study, 13 were new polymorphisms, 3 of which were located in 3\u2032\u2010UTR. Two possible non\u2010synonymous SNPs in dbSNP database were not found in the population tested. Judging from the results so far obtained in this case\u2010control study, there was no statistical evidence that ACE2 polymorphisms affect SARS infection or alter its clinical course. However, type II error was not negligible because of a relatively small size of samples tested.",

Nevertheless, this newly identified alternative 5\u2032\u2010untranslated exon expressed in the lung, and also newly recognized polymorphisms in this study might be of great help concerning investigations into the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the possible significance of the variations in further more in\u2010depth studies.",
