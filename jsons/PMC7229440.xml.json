The work by Kermack and McKendrick [18] formulated the general theory of susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR). A SIR model involves a system of coupled equations relating the numbers of susceptible, infected and recovered people over time, and computes the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population. Many variations of the original SIR model were proposed, such as the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible\u2013exposed\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SEIR), based on ordinary [19], stochastic [20] and fractional order [21, 22] differential equations. These recent versions were adopted for studying the spread of distinct infectious diseases [23, 24], including the COVID-19 [25]. However, the main concern of such approach is the model validation, since it requires to compare the results with real data. Contrary to model-driven, data-driven approaches rely on data series for deriving adequate fitting functions. These heuristic models describe well one stage of the epidemic, but fail when the disease evolves toward a different phase. We must also note that the heuristic model is useless in the initial epidemic phase, due to insufficient data [26, 27].",

The study does not aim to be a contribution tailored for medical treatment or prevention of the disease. Therefore, in a first phase, we adopt a nonlinear least-squares technique to determine possible candidate heuristic models for describing the data regarding COVID-19 infections. In a second phase, we use distinct metrics for processing the data both in the time and frequency domains. The information is visualized using hierarchical clustering (HC) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) for comparing the COVID-19 evolution in the different countries. The HC and MDS generate loci of points in 2- and 3-dimensional spaces representing the number of infections for each country. The positioning and the patterns formed by the points lead to direct interpretations of the results. The study is data-driven, and the models are applicable only at some stages of the outbreak and when enough data points are available.",

To the authors best knowledge, the HC and MDS techniques are not designed to make predictions. Indeed, they allow a better interpretation of the past and present. Nonetheless, we can take advantage of the MDS computational visualization to trace some similarities between the items represented in the loci. From Figs. 10 and 11, where time is a parametric variable, we verify that we do not obtain our intuitive feeling of time as a smooth and continuous variable embedded and synchronizing all events. In fact, we see that the time instant for the beginning and end of the trajectories vary considerably from country to country. Therefore, if we adopt a critical view we can interpret that the 1-dimensional time continuum (if exists) is not adequately represented by the two technique combination (i.e., MDS and Procrustes). However, it was already noticed in previous studies [51, 52], addressing a distinct phenomenon and applying only MDS, that datasets under the influence of social and human factors phenomena exhibit a relativistic behavior and eventually different velocities. Let us name the \u2018relativistic time\u2019 to make it distinct from the standard notion of constant speed physical time.",

Two approaches were considered for the period from December 31, 2019 up to April 12, 2020. In a first phase, heuristic models were used to fit the time series of the number of infections verified in a set of 79 countries. In a second phase, two metrics were used for comparing the countries data both in the time and frequency domains, and the HC and MDS techniques were adopted for clustering and visualization. The time evolution was also considered for a group of countries exhibiting a more dramatic spread of the COVID-19. The combination of Procrustes and MDS showed that besides the number of infections, the dynamic characteristics play an important role that is not evident in standard representations. In fact, the computational and mathematical modeling lead to the emergence of patterns both highlighting the main clusters and the similarities or dissimilarities between them. Given the potential of the techniques discussed here we can think of their application in several research directions such as the subdivision of data sets according with distinct criteria such as the age, or the geographical origin of the patients. Additionally, analysis considering a large set of influential factors besides merely the casualties can be tried, such as infected people staying in general or in intensive care in hospital, or recovered based on some type of treatment. Therefore, if sufficient and assertive information is collected, then research can follow the aforementioned computational methods to unravel space and time nonlinear dynamics embedded the data.",
