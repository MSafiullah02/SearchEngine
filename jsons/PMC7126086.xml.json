The networks driving initial epidemic spread often follow major transportation or trade routes between large cities, or between gatherings of animals such as markets. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Vietnam in late February 2003 after already spreading undetected through international air travel from China and Hong Kong, and seeding clusters of infection in hospital patients and health-care workers in Singapore and Canada (World Health Organization, 2003). In mid-April 2009, pandemic influenza A/H1N1 was first detected in the United States having already spread from Mexico (World Health Organization, 2009). Within 3 weeks, cases were reported from 30 countries in three continents. The index cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the 2001 United Kingdom outbreak were detected in south-east England nearly a week after infected sheep had entered the market chain in the north-east of the country, leading to a widespread epidemic (Gibbens and Wilesmith, 2002).",

            "text": "Until 2007, Australia was one of only three countries to have never experienced an outbreak of equine influenza. Only small numbers of horses imported for breeding had been recently vaccinated, leaving almost the entire horse population susceptible. During an outbreak lasting 4 months in 2007, equine influenza (A/H3N8) spread rapidly through the horse populations of two Australian states, infecting approximately 70 000 horses on over 9000 premises. Most of the geographic spread of this epidemic occurred undetected within the first 10 days and was associated with the movement of infected horses prior to the complete implementation of movement restrictions (Cowled et al., 2009). Clinical signs were first observed in a recently imported horse in quarantine 40 km west of Sydney (Fig. 1\na) and 5 days later in two horses kept in a large horse boarding and training facility in central Sydney (Centennial Parklands Equestrian Centre). These two horses had attended an equestrian event at Maitland, 160 km north of Sydney, on the previous weekend (17\u201319 August 2007). Contact-tracing revealed numerous infected premises linked to horses returning from either the event at Maitland, or another horse event the following weekend, at the Narrabri showground nearly 400 km away (Callinan, 2008). In accordance with the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan horse movement restrictions were triggered immediately on 25 August 2007 (Callinan, 2008), subsequent spatial spread was believed to be driven by local spread from those premises infected in the first weeks of the epidemic (Cowled et al., 2009). Previous analyses identified two spatial effects in the first month of the epidemic: local spread within 5 km of infected premises, and spread over much greater distances associated with the attendance of horses at equestrian events where transmission was known to have occurred (Firestone et al., 2011).",

            "text": "When a complex contact network structure underlies an epidemic, traditional approaches may be insufficient to appropriately describe the spatio-temporal pattern of the epidemic and estimate key parameters (Small et al., 2007). For example, methods of estimating the reproductive ratio of an epidemic often rely on assuming homogenous probabilities of contact amongst infected and susceptible individuals in the population at risk (i.e. random mixing). However, the underlying contact network structure constrains contact leading to violation of this assumption (Anderson and May, 1991). To this end, social network analysis (SNA) has been used to study contact-tracing data from epidemics in both human (McElroy et al., 2003, Sena et al., 2007) and animal populations (Shirley and Rushton, 2005, Ortiz-Pelaez et al., 2006). These approaches have largely ignored spatial proximity between infected premises. Recently, Green et al. (2008) developed a spatially explicit model to estimate the importance of cattle movements in the spread of bovine tuberculosis, whilst Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez et al. (2011) investigated the importance of animal movements, contacts and spatial relationships between dairy farms in the context of endemic disease spread. Network analysis has also been applied to investigate animal movements, irrespective of disease status, to develop hypothetical models of how disease might spread through animal populations (Webb, 2005, Martinez-Lopez et al., 2009).",

Networks can be used to represent the patterns of connectivity of populations, and therefore describe aspects of disease transmission that depart from the mean field model (Diekmann et al., 1998). Depending on the disease context, a network can be constructed from contact-tracing data representing different units of interest, with nodes representing either individual animals (Porphyre et al., 2008) or farms (Ortiz-Pelaez et al., 2006), schools, communities or households (Giebultowicz et al., 2011). The connections can represent a wide range of context-dependant relationships or links including actual physical contact, movement of a resource from one node to another, or the sharing of a space at a given point in time. The links thus formed may be either directed or undirected depending on whether or not a resource can travel in both directions between the pair of nodes (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). Undirected links can be represented in directed networks by two directionally opposed directed links. Depending on whether the magnitude of flow is contextually important, links may also be weighted by values or dichotomised.",

The resulting distance matrix was dichotomised at a distance cut-off used to represent an assumption of the maximum distance over which local spread might have occurred.

Although the proximity network was symmetrical it was considered as a directed network to facilitate combination with the contact network. Spatial coordinates were included as node attributes in all networks to maintain the spatial dimension. Rather than applying a set distance cut-off, we could have applied a nearest-neighbour method (creating a less dense and less clustered network) but this would have required implicitly assuming that the nearest of a group of proximate infectious premises was the actual source of infection.",

In directed networks, two types of components may be defined: \u2018strong components\u2019 where every node within the subset can be reached from every other node obeying the direction of links, and \u2018weak components\u2019 where the directions of the links are disregarded (Hanneman and Riddle, 2005).

R\n0 may be estimated at the individual or premises-level, and can be adjusted to account for non-susceptible hosts, control measures such as vaccination, and non-homogenous mixing (Matthews and Woolhouse, 2005). A related concept, the effective reproductive ratio (R) is the average number of secondary infections produced by each infected individual that enters a population that contains non-susceptible individuals or is subject to disease control measures (Matthews and Woolhouse, 2005). R is often directly estimated based on actual epidemic data, and may approximate R\n0 early in an epidemic. Cowled et al. (2009) applied purely spatial methods to estimate R at the premises-level for this epidemic, assuming homogenous random mixing (equal likelihood of contact between premises). We corrected their naive estimate (\u03c1) for the early outbreak period, using the following formula (May et al., 2001):R=\u03c1(1+[CVdeg]2)where the coefficient of variation of degree (CV\ndeg) represents heterogeneity in contact as the ratio of the standard deviation of degree to the mean degree, which was estimated based on the contact network.",

In this analysis, we grouped nodes into \u2018clusters\u2019 according to the weak components in the maximal proximity network, then block-modelled the maximal contact-and-proximity network based on these clusters. Such analyses emphasise movements that introduced infection into new spatial clusters.",

The Maitland and Narrabri events were potential cutpoints in the network with out-degrees of 26 and 34 premises, respectively. Only five other nodes, representing the equestrian events at Warwick, the Centennial Parklands Equestrian Centre, and three smaller private horse premises (nodes 26, 113 and 388), served as the origins of infected horse movements (out-degree > 0). Each of these nodes functioned as an additional cutpoint in the contact network. This heterogeneity in degree is quantified in the contact network's relatively high out-degree centralisation. Conversely, the contact network's in-degree centralisation was very low, with only one node (Centennial Parklands Equestrian Centre) being the destination of infected horse movements from multiple premises (in-degree = 2). The latter of these movements originated from the Narrabri event and is represented in Fig. 2b by a dotted line.",

Each of these characteristics have important implications for infectious disease spread and the design of appropriate control strategies. Through applying bond percolation theory to epidemic modelling (Newman, 2003), it has been shown that the clustering in such networks lowers the threshold at which an infectious agent can infect all nodes, effectively increasing the reproductive ratio of the epidemic. However, this may lead to localised depletion of susceptible individuals within clusters, and fewer individuals overall being infected (Newman, 2003). In the outbreak studied, the combined contact-and-proximity network was highly clustered because of the spatial structure of the data. Yet, prior to the implementation of movement restrictions, the presence of sparse contact links connected distant spatial clusters leading to most nodes being reachable within very few geodesic steps (low average path length). This allowed the epidemic to easily \u2018percolate\u2019 through the population, rapidly infecting a large number of widely dispersed premises. Once movement restrictions were implemented, in effect cutting out the contact links between clusters, the epidemic could be expected to burn out over time in numerous spatially isolated clusters.",

            "text": "In most infectious disease situations, network and local spatial spread are expected to overlap to some extent. To make decisions on disease control, it is important to assess in broad terms the amount of network versus local spatial spread. If animal movements occur to a premises that has already been infected (by local spatial spread), then our network analysis approach would likely over-estimate the proportion of premises infected through the network. However, likelihood-based approaches allow estimation of the probability that infection of individual premises occurred by network or other means (such as fomites or windborne spread). By comparing our network analysis findings to those of a purely spatial likelihood-based approach we were able to identify 14 (95% CI: 9, 20 premises) of the 70 premises in the contact network that were more likely to have been infected by local spatial spread. Furthermore, combining the two approaches provided an explicit description of the contact network and those premises that were most at risk of network spread (in this case 70 of 197 of the premises infected in the first 10 days). It is therefore important to combine this network analysis approach with a likelihood-based approach to avoid over-attributing the contribution of network-associated spread. Such information would be valuable to the decision-maker attempting to control disease spread, since methods of spread can dictate the control strategies implemented.",

However, our findings also suggest that over 70% of early spread occurred through local spatial spread. Such local spread may have occurred through direct contact or droplet transmission between horses on adjacent premises, and over short distances through windborne aerosol transmission and spread on fomites (such as riding equipment, peoples clothes and footwear, or on vehicles). This current analysis was limited in that it was not possible to differentiate the various components of local spread by transmission mechanism. This is an active area of further research utilising stochastic simulation, parameterised in part by the results of this analysis, to further our understanding of the mechanisms of disease flow between premises. Nonetheless, much is known from outbreak investigations, anecdotal accounts, and experimental and observational epidemiological studies. An infected coughing horse can spread the virus for up to 32 m (Miller, 1965), short range transmission on fomites has previously been reported (Guthrie et al., 1999), as has windborne spread of aerosolised virus over distances of 3.2 and 8 km (Huntington, 1990, Dalglish, 1992). Furthermore, Davis et al. (2009) noted that in a single cluster of the 2007 outbreak in Australia, directional spread (within 1\u20132 km) was consistent with the predominant wind direction over the same time period.",

Indeed, during this outbreak, on-farm biosecurity measures including disinfecting footwear were found to be associated with a large reduction in odds of infection (Firestone et al., 2011). Furthermore, only a few rare instances of spread over distances of 20\u201380 km were noted in which no infected horse movement or other plausible transmission pathway was identified despite thorough investigation (The EI Epidemiology Support Group, 2008).",

Clusters whose contact links were missing would be connected to the GWC of the maximal contact-and-proximity network through spatial proximity to infected premises in the next nearest cluster, rather than through a contact link. Any such missing data might have obscured an important contact network link thereby slightly inflating our estimates of local spread distances.",

The study was restricted in time, such that premises were only considered infected if their onset date was within the first 2 weeks of the outbreak. Also, links representing infected horse movements were only added if the date of movement and the onset date on the originating and destination premises were in a logical sequence with respect to the incubation and infectious periods of equine influenza. These criteria were set quite conservatively, including only a 1 day margin of error. These strict criteria explain why some infected premises traced to the events at Maitland and Narrabri, and noted elsewhere to have inaccurate onset dates (The EI Epidemiology Support Group, 2008), were excluded from this analysis. If these selection criteria were relaxed to further account for such reporting errors this would have increased the likelihood of misclassifying the mechanism of spread to certain infected premises and clusters. We also purposefully excluded from this analysis several records of potential transmission via fomites because routine reporting of such movements between infected premises was not conducted during the outbreak. The inclusion of these records in the contact-network structure might have slightly reduced our estimates of the distance of local spread, but would have introduced a lot of uncertainty.",

Prior to disease detection, around a quarter of early epidemic spread occurred through the movement of infected horses, and these horse movements defined much of the spatial extent of the outbreak. By describing spatial clusters with consideration of contact-tracing network topology, and estimating the shape of the early epidemic's transmission kernel, we found that most local spread occurred within 5 km of an infected premises, with little local spread occurring beyond 15 km. This analysis could be extended through further characterisation of local spread within clusters, and together with research into underlying contact structures of the horse industry be applied to improve targeting of outbreak surveillance and control activities in future similar outbreaks.",
