Characteristic features of their genome, replication strategy, structural proteins and polymerase later supported this classification. The toroviruses and coronaviruses were recognized as separate genera within the Coronaviridae family in 1993.\nThe Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae are now classified as members of the Nidovirales order, viruses with monopartite plus-strand RNA genomes that are transcribed to yield a nested set of overlapping subgenomic mRNAs that have a common 3\u2032 end.",

The spikes are oligomers of the 180\u2013200 kDa S glycoprotein that binds to receptor glycoproteins and induces fusion of the viral envelope with cell membranes and, sometimes, cell\u2013cell fusion. S proteins of several coronaviruses also bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. A small envelope glycoprotein, M, traverses the lipid bilayer three times and interacts with the nucleocapsid in the virion. Intracellular transport of the M glycoprotein is arrested in the Golgi, which may determine the intracellular budding site of coronaviruses. The small E glycoprotein, originally believed to be a nonstructural protein, is present in small amounts in virions, and is essential for virus budding. Envelopes of some coronaviruses also contain a hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein, HE, which forms short spikes that bind N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid or N-glycolylneuraminic acid and have esterase activity. The nucleocapsid protein, N, encapsidates the monopartite, linear, single-stranded genomic RNA. The internal structure of coronaviruses was originally believed to be a helical nucleocapsid as shown in Fig. 1. Recently, however, cores that appear to have cubic symmetry were observed in detergent-treated virus preparations. Thus, the internal structure of coronaviruses is not yet understood.",

A negative-strand RNA template corresponding to each subgenomic mRNA is also found in infected cells (Fig. 2). A nonprocessive, leader-primed polymerase activity was postulated to account for the presence of the leader on each mRNA. A complex of polymerase and leader transcribed from the 3\u2032 end of the full-length negative-strand template would bind to an IS on the template and act as a primer for synthesis of the subgenomic mRNA. This hypothesis does not explain the presence of the negative-strand templates for each subgenomic RNA. An alternative hypothesis suggests that polymerase jumping occurs during negative-strand synthesis, generating the subgenomic negative-strand templates for subsequent mRNA synthesis. Mutations in the IS preceding an ORF can prevent transcription of the mRNA with that ORF at its 5\u2032 end. Although virus strains differ in the relative amounts of various mRNAs in infected cells, there is little temporal regulation of transcription.",

First, during the replication of each approximately 30 kb RNA genome, several point mutations would be expected to occur, based upon the known error frequency of RNA polymerases. Second, coronavirus genomes undergo a very high frequency of RNA recombination.\nSmall or large deletions at the sites of recombination can produce mutant viruses, or defective interfering (DI) RNAs and subgenomic replicons. Large deletions in certain sites of the gene encoding the S glycoprotein and mutations in the N gene yield viruses with altered virulence, tissue tropism, or thermal stability. Thus, even after sequential single plaque isolations, coronavirus stocks always contain a mixture of quasispecies. Different virus variants may be selected during passage in different cell lines or under a variety of culture conditions. Therefore it is important to document the passage history of coronavirus strains or mutants.\nRarely, recombination may occur between coronavirus genomic RNA and mRNAs of cells or unrelated viruses. Such an illegitimate RNA recombination event may have resulted in the incorporation of the mRNA that encodes the HE glycoprotein of influenza C into the genome of a coronavirus ancestral to the MHV group. Similarly, some of the NS ORFs may have been acquired through recombination with foreign mRNAs.",

It assembles with genomic plus-strand RNA in the cytoplasm to form helical nucleocapsids. Viral glycoproteins are translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where S oligomerizes, then they are transported to the Golgi, where S proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved by a trypsin-like host cell protease to yield S1 and S2 peptides. The S and HE glycoproteins are expressed on the plasma membrane.

Although cells of the natural host species are generally required for infection by virions, purified coronavirus genomic RNA can infect cells across species barriers. Receptors have been identified for several coronaviruses: MHV uses murine biliary glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily; HCoV-229E and TGEV use human and porcine aminopeptidase N (APN), respectively; FIPV and FeCoV use feline APN, which can also be utilized by HCoV-229E and TGEV; and BCoV and HCoV-OC43 use N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid moieties.

Nucleic acid sequence analysis also shows that certain pairs of coronaviruses that cause different syndromes in the same host should probably be considered strains of a single virus. Thus, PRCoV and TGEV of swine, which cause epizootic respiratory and enteric disease, respectively, are highly homologous, except for a deletion of more than 675 nucleotides in the S gene of PRCoV.

Infection is often inapparent, and virus particles or antigens and subsequent seroconversion are observed in healthy individuals. The viruses are enzootic or endemic in their host species, causing sporadic disease and seasonal outbreaks when enough susceptibles are available. Adults with acute, self-limited, inapparent infection transmit virus to neonates that develop clinical disease. Coronavirus diseases are more severe in neonatal animals than adults, either because pre-existing immunity to related virus strains moderates infections in adults, or because the immature immune system permits higher levels of virus replication.\nIn immunocompromised hosts, infection may be inapparent but virus shedding may be prolonged. Such individuals serve as reservoirs of virus.

While some MHV strains are strictly enterotropic, most strains infect both the respiratory and enteric tracts. Some MHV strains causes focal hepatitis, acute encephalitis, and subacute or chronic focal demyelinating disease in the murine brain and spinal cord. Cell fusion, necrosis and infiltration with mononuclear cells are observed in acutely infected tissues, depending upon the strain of virus and strain of mice. Susceptibility to MHV is affected by at least three murine genes that determine the virus receptor isoforms expressed, the yield of infectious virus and the ability to generate monocyte procoagulant activity, a prothrombinase in the coagulation pathway, in response to MHV infection. Mutations in the MHV and TGEV S glycoproteins can alter tissue tropism, virulence and persistence.\nHEV causes respiratory infection and outbreaks of encephalomyelitis in suckling pigs, and virus infection of neurons that innervate the stomach causes vomiting and wasting syndrome.",

A cardiotropic rabbit coronavirus causes dilated myocardiopathy and death within 7\u201312 days after intravenous inoculation of rabbits with serum from an infected rabbit. Rat coronaviruses infect the respiratory tract, salivary and lacrimal glands, causing sialodacryadenitis, and can also infect the urogenital tract, interfering with breeding.",

These immune responses are useful for diagnostic purposes, terminate infection, and probably ameliorate subsequent infections, but they do not necessarily prevent reinfection. In newborns, passive oral immunization with neutralizing antibody can sometimes prevent fatal coronavirus enteritis. Because coronavirus diseases are generally most severe in newborns that do not respond well to active immunization, an attractive strategy to protect these newborn animals that is being explored is to vaccinate pregnant dams in order to maximize antiviral antibodies in the colostrum and milk.",

Infection of glial cells with MHV can upregulate expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II antigens, making these cells potential targets for cytotoxic T cells. MHV infection causes thymic atrophy, and the virus can also infect B lymphocytes. Polyclonal B cell activation and hypergammaglobulinemia are associated with FIPV infection.
