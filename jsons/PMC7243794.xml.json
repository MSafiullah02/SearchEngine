            "text": "Cellular communication relies upon binding of ligands to specific cell surface receptors. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key players in initiating and regulating cellular processes as they mediate responses to hormones, neurotransmitters, metabolites, ions, fatty acids, pathogens, and physical stimuli, such as light, smell, taste, and mechanical stretch. Moreover they can be activated by synthetic agonists, inhibited by antagonists and inverse agonists, or affected by allosteric modulators. They actually represent the most important superfamily of clinical targets in disorders of neural, immune, cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory system and cancer (Allard, Dushek, O. Coombs, van der Merwe, 2012, Cole, Sood, 2011, Mary, Fehrentz, Damian, Vedi\u00e9, Martinez, Marie, Baneres, 2013, Unal, Karnik, 2012). In particular, for disease like asthma, it is known to involve specific GPCRs, called \u03b2\n2-adrenergic receptors. This is because asthma entails a continuous use of \u03b2\n2-agonists, which are located in human airway epithelial cells. Indeed, this results in loss of bronchoprotective effects and deterioration of asthma control. The importance of such receptors in cancer relates to the fact that cAMP-based markers have shown to have a great potential for the early diagnosis of certain tumors. Groundwork for translation of the so called \u03b2-blockade as a novel adjuvant to existing therapeutic strategies in clinical oncology is on its way (see e.g. Banerjee, Papu John, Al-Wadei, Schuller, 2016, Cho, Lee, Cho-Chung, 2000, Choi, Thi Thao Tran, Van Ngu, Woong Park, Suk Song, Hyun Kim, Bae, Diskul Na Ayudthaya, Munir, Kim, Baek, Song, Ryu, Nam, 2018, Cvijic, Kita, Shih, Di Paola, Chin, 2000, Liu, Yang, Zhang, Liu, Liu, 2010).",

These receptors are integral membrane proteins with an extracellular N-terminus and seven TransMembrane helical domains (TMs), from TM1 to TM7, connected by loop regions. Nowadays GPCR signaling is recognized to be more complex that was originally understood (Kobilka and Deupi, 2007). Briefly, their binding to very different kinds of extracellular stimuli induces TM domain conformational changes and the structural remodelling of the protein. The latter allows for the coupling with cytoplasmic G proteins, which is followed by the activation of second messenger generating enzymes. The produced second messenger can activate many downstream signaling pathways inside the cell (Lefkowitz, 2007). This activity of GPCRs is known to be detected through measurements of cyclyc Adenosyne Monophospate -cAMP-, the detectable signature of the pathway arising in response to ligands, such as epinephrine. The production of cAMP in the cellular environment turns out to be modulated by several factors. In particular, the presence of Multidrug Resistance Proteins-MRPs allows for the efflux of cAMP from the interior of the cell to the extracellular fluid, by so maintaining homeostatic intracellular concentrations. For this reason, MRPs are called transporters, as they contribute to keep a balance of cAMP inside the cell. A schematic of this process is depicted in Fig. 1\n.",

Two main subfamilies, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which differ in tissue localization, ligand specificity, G protein coupling, and downstream effector mechanisms, are present. Diverse diseases, such as asthma, hypertension, and heart failure, are related to genetic modifications of adrenergic receptors. In particular, \u03b22-adrenergic receptors (\u03b22ARs) are found in smooth muscles throughout the body, and \u03b22AR agonists are common treatments for asthma and preterm labor (Cherezov et al., 2007). In (Biondi et al., 2006) it has been demonstrated the presence of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in HTR-8/SVneo cell line, a well characterized first-trimester human extravillous trophoblast-derived cell line. Such cells invade the maternal uterine stroma, the decidua and the deeper portion of the myometrium evoking profound changes within the uterine vessels. A limited trophoblast invasion of maternal vessels has been correlated to both preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, whereas an excessive trophoblast invasion is associated with invasive mole, placenta accreta and choriocarcinoma (Lunghi et al., 2007). Other studies showed the importance of GPCRs during pregnancy (Hanna, Goldman-Wohl, Hamani, Avraham, Greenfield, Natanson-Yaron, Prus, Cohen-Daniel, Arnon, Manaster, Gazit, Yutkin, Benharroch, Porgador, Keshet, Yagel, Mandelboim, 2006, Le Bouteiller, Tabiasco, 2006).",

Their results can best be explained by either a rotation of TM6 and a tilting of TM6 toward TM5 during agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The structure, activation, and signaling of a GPCR is heavily influenced by the bilayer environment. This influence seems likely to involve either indirect bilayer effects, specific membrane-GPCR interactions, or a combination of both (Chini, Parenti, 2004, Drake, Shenoy, Lefkowitz, 2006, Oates, Watts, 2011).",

Some subsets of GPCRs are preferentially segregated to discrete regions of the membrane defined as lipid rafts (Barnett-Norris, Lynch, Reggio, 2005, Becher, McIlhinney, 2005, Bridge, Levin, Morton-Firth, 1998, Chini, Parenti, 2004, Foster, de Hoog, Ma, 2003, Gopalakrishnan, Forsten-Williams, Nugent, Tauber, 2005, Jiao, Zhang, Xu, Oppenheim, Jin, 1996, Ostrom, Insel, 2004, Patel, Murray, Insel, 2008, Shukla, 2016, Villar, Cuevas, Zheng, Jose, 2016, Watkins, Miller, Majewski, Kuhl, 2011). Despite lipid rafts are involved in a number of biologically relevant phenomena and their formation has been demonstrated to often serve as entry port for some viruses, including SARS-CoV ones (Lu et al., 2008), why is this the case and what is the physics at the basis of the associated remodelling of the lipid membrane remain still open questions (Fallahi-Sichani, Linderman, 2009, Gopalakrishnan, Forsten-Williams, Nugent, Tauber, 2005, Jacobson, Mouritsen, Anderson, 2007). Lipid raft are highly dynamic thickened areas on the lipid membrane with different dimensions and a complex heterogeneous composition. This is due to the fact that such rafts host a variety of transmembrane proteins responsible of compartmentalizing cellular processes to isolated districts of the cell. These planar regions form localized microdomains on the cell membrane and are hard to be directly observable in vivo (Dharani, 2015, Risselada, Marrink, 2008). In particular, they appear as dynamic nanoscale assemblies, where a high glycosphingolipid and cholesterol content in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer is present. This composition gives them a gel-like liquid-ordered organisation in comparison with the surrounding phospholipid-rich disordered membrane (Chini, Parenti, 2004, Lingwood, Simons, 2010).",

In particular,the adenosine A1, \u03b11-AR, \u03b21-AR, \u03b22-AR, AT1R, the endothelin (ETA-A and ET-B) receptors, and the M2-muscarinic receptors have all been localized to lipid rafts and/or caveolae (Drake et al., 2006). The association of \u03b22AR with caveolin3 in myocytes membranes has been demonstrated, as well as the fact that the confinement of \u03b22-AR to caveolae is of critical importance for regulation of the intrinsic contraction rate in these membrane preparations (Xiang et al., 2002). How cholesterol modifies GPCR activity appears very much receptor-dependent, with regards to both upregulation and downregulation and of direct and indirect action (Hanson, Cherezov, Griffith, Roth, Jaakola, Chien, Velasquez, Kuhn, Stevens, 2008, Oates, Watts, 2011). The mechanical and chemical response of these amazing structures depends on many factors, such as the shape of the membrane, the temperature of the environment, the osmotic pressure, the chemical composition of lipid mixture, etc. Hu et al.

            "text": "Depending on the presence of embedded specialized proteins into the lipid membrane, several predicting models have been developed (Agrawal, Steigmann, 2009, Biscari, Bisi, 2002, Canham, 1970, Deseri, Piccioni, Zurlo, 2008, Deseri, Pollaci, Zingales, Dayal, 2015, Deseri, Zurlo, 2013, Jenkins, 1977, Rangamani, Benjamini, Agrawal, Smit, Steigmann, Oster, 2014, Walani, Torres, Agrawal, 2015, Zurlo, 2006). Most of them are based on the characterization of the energy, with the aim of predicting the ordered-disordered phenomena arising in transition regions for contrasting the external stimuli. Indeed, thickness reduction of the bilayer is observed by changing the mechanical and chemical conditions in the environment surrounding the cell. For this reason, several Authors adopted the change in thickness as order parameter for studying such kind of systems (Goldstein, Leibler, 1989, Owicki, McConnell, 1979, Sackmann, 1995). Without explicitly doing so, a theory for the chemo-mechanical coupling of lipid bilayers accounting for curvature changes, viscosity, diffusion and Lo\u2212Ld phase transitions has recently been presented in (Sahu et al., 2017). The Lo\u2212Ld phase transition has been modelled through a dimensionless order parameter related to the fraction of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, known as DOPC. This is known to exhibit disordered features in agreement with the curliness of the tails mentioned above. Furthermore, binding and diffusion of certain proteins, epsin-1, is thoroughly analyzed. As pointed out above, the physical behavior of such membranes is regulated by many factors enabling the occurrence of out-of-plane tractions, while in-plane shear stresses are not transmitted unless their viscosity is accounted for.",

Bilayer elasticity has been fruitfully exploited in the literature for the study of equilibrium shapes of red blood cells (Jenkins, 1977) and GUVs (Giant Unilamellar Vesicle) (Canham, 1970, Helfrich, 1973). The effects of embedded proteins or rod-like inclusions in the lipid membrane have been analyzed in Agrawal and Steigmann (2009), Walani et al. (2015), Biscari and Bisi (2002), together with the analysis of buds formation (Lipowsky, 1992) with the coexistence of domains characterized by different bending rigidities (Agrawal, Steigmann, 2008, Baumgart, Das, Webb, Jenkins, 2005).",

In order to predict the dynamic remodelling of the cell membrane, following thermodynamic arguments, a chemo-mechanical coupling is found for the obtained chemical potentials of such species. These potentials regulate active species diffusion through mass balance which, in turn, involves the kinetics of binding through the occurence of interspecific terms. The potentials of the active species determine a corresponding coupling for the resulting energetics. Furthermore, it is found that the chemo-mechanical coupling found for such potentials is the specific work exerted by the lateral pressure (arising across the membrane thickness) against the volume changes around the interaction sites among the species domains and the surrounding lipids. It is worth noting that accounting for the aspects mentioned above enables mechanobiology to give a mechanically-based justification to the experimental findings of Nobel Prizes 2012 Kobilka (Kobilka and Deupi, 2007) and Leifkovitz (Lefkowitz, 2007).",

By fixing temperature, energy density coefficients are fixed to those ones in Table 1. Whenever no curvature changes are experienced by the lipid bilayer, in the plane strain approximation the elastic energy density in (3.9) takes the form:(3.14)\u03c8(J)=\u03c6(J)\u221212\u03b3(J)Jx2.We note that the functions(3.15)\u03b3(J)=\u22122\u03b1(J).and \u03c4(J), defined by (3.11), can be interpreted as transition and stress-like functions, respectively, as the former drives the boundary layer wherever transitions between two phases occur.

This is done by taking into account intrinsic rates as well as mutual interactions with other fields characterizing the system by means of suitable coupling terms. The present model mainly focuses on the active receptors and transport proteins on the cell membrane. In particular, in the presence of a specific ligand, binding and activation GPCRs kindles cytoplasmatic signaling pathways. The latter allow for both regulating some intracellular processes and communicating with the extra-cellular environment by expelling molecules through the activation of specific transport proteins, such as MRPs. This coupled mechanism can be followed in practice by measuring the levels of intracellular and extracellular concentrations of cAMP, involved in many physiological processes of the cell. In particular, intracellular cAMP production follows the response of the GPCRs to certain ligands, such as epinephrine. The level of cytoplasmatic cAMP is modulated by MRPs that permit the efflux of cAMP from the interior of the cell to the extracellular fluid. In this way, MRPs control cell homeostasis and determine an agonist interaction with membrane receptors. In order to trace the interplay of the transmembrane proteins, we introduce mass balances for two selected species, n1=\u03be, representing the G proteins, and n2=\u03b6, namely the transport proteins.

Indeed W=W(\u03bb,\u03bbx,ni) represents the energy per unit area in the active (reference) configuration for which no complete expression is yet available. With the aim of providing an explicit representation for W, an additive decomposition is assumed between the (hyperelastic)energy of the membrane and a second potential associated to the energetics of the transmembrane proteins. This assumption is stated in the following form:(3.37)W=Whyp(\u03bb,\u03bbx)\u2212Wni(\u03d5,ni)=Whyp(\u03bb,\u03bbx)\u2212Wni(\u03bb\u22121,ni).it is worth notning that the second term account for the possibility that activation and conformational changes of GPCRs may affect the membrane thickness, measured through \u03bb\u22121. The total differential of W thus gives:(3.38)dW=\u2202W\u2202\u03bbd\u03bb+\u2202W\u2202\u03bbxd\u03bbx+\u2202W\u2202nidni=P\u02dcd\u03bb+\u03bc\u02dcidni.Because of relations (3.35), the following equations for the stress and for the chemical potentials relative to the active (reference) configurations follow:(3.39)P\u02dc=Kr\u22121P=\u2202W\u2202\u03bb\u2212\u2202\u2202x\u2202W\u2202\u03bbx\n(3.40)\u03bc\u02dci=Kr\u22121\u03bci=\u2202W\u2202ni=\u2212\u2202Wni\u2202ni.A Legendre transformation of (3.38) can now be performed by subtracting the variation d(ni\u03bc\u02dci)=\u03bc\u02dcidni+nid\u03bc\u02dci, by obtaining the coupled potential(3.41)dW^=d(Whyp(\u03bb,\u03bbx)\u2212W^\u03bci(\u03bb\u22121,\u03bci))=P\u02dcd\u03bb\u2212nid\u03bc\u02dcifrom which it follows that(3.42)ni=\u2212\u2202W^\u2202\u03bc\u02dci=\u2202W^\u03bci\u2202\u03bc\u02dci.Because Whyp is independent of the chemical potentials and since W^\u03bci depends on the variables \u03bb\u22121 and \u03bc\u02dci, the latter relation also implies that(3.43)dni=\u2212d(\u2202W^\u2202\u03bc\u02dci)=1\u03bb\u22122\u2202P\u02dc\u2202\u03bc\u02dcid\u03bb\u22121\u2212\u22022W^\u2202\u03bc\u02dci2d\u03bc\u02dci=\u2212c\u03bbid\u03bb\u22121+c\u03bcid\u03bc\u02dci.\n",

Under the same initial conditions, rafts also occur in the tensed membrane, where a transverse contraction and initial longitudinal elongation additionally take place in the Ld-phase as elastic response of the applied traction.",

The interplay between RL proteins \u03be and transporters \u03b6 is studied as a result of the introduced interspecific dynamics. More specifically, an initial growth of the GPCRs binding with ligands first occurs. Upon comparing this finding with the experimentally determined intracellular cAMP (cAMPi) normalized concentration, an estimate of the binding Receptor-Ligand (RL) compounds is provided according to (2.2). This is because GPCRs activation directly triggers the cell response by initiating the cAMP signaling pathway. Homeostatic levels of cAMPi are restored thanks to the activation of the Multidrug Resistant transport Proteins (MRPs) driving the efflux of part of the produced cAMP towards the extracellular environment. It is worth noting that a very good agreement is found between the predicted MRPs fraction and the (normalized) increase of cAMPe.",

A density change of active receptors drives the system towards an active configuration in which the lipid bilayer shrinks around active domains, this causing membrane deformation and thickening in the form of lipid rafts. Unlike usual description of finite deformations and multiphysics, all the three configurations are global. This is justified through a non-standard multiscale geometric framework provided by the theory of Structured Deformations (see e.g. Deseri and Owen, 2003, Deseri and Owen (2010), Deseri and Owen (2015), Deseri and Owen (2019), Palumbo et al.

Here, each material particle of the body in the virgin configuration (displayed in the top-left side of this figure) gets first mapped into an intermediate region (center of the figure) through a pair of smooth bijections (i,K) (where i stands for the vector-valued identity and the tensor K accounts for all the submacroscopic changes). Indeed, it can be shown that Kr=detK and, hence, this invariant of K accounts for remodelling. Secondly, each neighborhood of each particle located in this intermediate global configuration gets classically deformed through a pair (y,\u2207y), where y is a smooth deformation field from the intermediate global configuration onto the current one, while the second item in the pair is the deformation gradient from the intermediate global configuration. Features of Structured Deformations in connection with the examined biological systems are discussed in more details in Appendix C in which an alternative scheme of the kinematics is given in Fig. 13.",
