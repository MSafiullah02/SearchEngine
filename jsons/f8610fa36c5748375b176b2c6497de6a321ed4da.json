Stage II-March 16 to March 31: The arrival of zaireen from Iran, participants in tableeghi jamat from foreign countries, and Pakistani people arriving from abroad in special flights caused an abrupt increase in the COVID 19 confirmed cases in the fifteen days, from March 16 to March 31 (seen in the figure 2). The unexpected burden of thousands of people with foreign travel history, in the presence of lack of testing and quarantine facilities, and transporting the zaireen to their home towns caused enormous pressure on limited financial resources and medical infrastructure.
