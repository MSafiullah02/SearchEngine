From the same family as the SARS and MERS coronaviruses (10% and 35% fatality rates respectively [4, 5] ), 2019-nCoV has also led to serious cases of pneumonia, albeit with a lower estimated fatality rate of 2-3% at the present time [6] .

Contact tracing from identified index cases was able to establish links to their presumed infectors. While it was not possible to pinpoint exact dates of infection, the dates at which symptoms in both infectees and (presumed) infectors occurred were determined, and the difference in these dates taken as a proxy for the elapsed time since infection of the infector (see [7] for technical issues that arise from this approach).

Indeed, the Wuhan study revealed that the average time from onset of illness to a medical visit was 5.8 days [1] , comparable to the incubation time. To obtain a more sobering view of isolation, suppose that an individual's time to detection is twice the incubation time. Using the lognormal incubation density cited above, the new detection time distribution will also be lognormal but now with a mean (standard deviation) of 10.4 (7.8) days. Applying Eq. 6 yields \u03b2 I 's of 0.84, 1.07 and 1.1 for isolations of 7, 14 and unlimited days.

Screening and quarantining individuals potentially exposed elsewhere upon entry to a community (as has been the case at airports) certainly can prevent the importation of new infections and their subsequent transmission chains, though at the cost of containing uninfected persons. Beyond this, quarantine (typically at home where it is recommended that the exposed person not share immediate space, utensils, towels etc. with others) is meant for apparently healthy individuals discovered to be at risk of exposure via contact tracing with the idea that should they in fact have become infected, they would become ill without transmitting the virus and then report for isolation.
