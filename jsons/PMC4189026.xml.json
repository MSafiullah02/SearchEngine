            "text": "Wildlife plays a key role in emerging infectious diseases by providing a \u201czoonotic pool\u201d from which pathogens may emerge [1]. Zoonotic pathogens represent approximately 60% of all pathogens able to infect humans [2]. In recent years, bats have been implicated in numerous emerging infectious disease events and have been recognized as important reservoir hosts for viruses that can cross the species barrier to infect humans and other domestic and wild mammals [3]. The role of bats in viral diseases is well established, particularly their role as hosts for lyssaviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, astroviruses and adenoviruses [3,4,5]. Bats have several unique features that may maximize their effectiveness as reservoir hosts for viruses. Bats are the second largest order of mammals. Currently, there are about 1200 recognized bat species worldwide, accounting for approximately 21% of all mammalian species. Bats have the potential to rapidly and widely spread viruses (having a high mobility, they are the only mammals capable of flight). They have a long lifespan and a high survival rate, and many bat species have a gregarious behavior. Bats can fly long distances between their summer and overwintering sites, permitting the exchange of viruses between conspecifics or bats of other species, i.e., in France, rabies virus infections have been associated with the migratory routes of Nathusius\u2019 pipistrelle (Pipistrellus nathusii) bats [6]. Persistent viral infections occurring among long-lived bats, coupled with their often gregarious roosting behavior, could greatly increase the potential for intra- and inter-species transmission of viruses [7], especially in summer and winter periods. Seasonality in temperate zone bats includes birthing periods, migration, gregarious behavior and torpor. Each of these strategies may affect population density, contact rates and immune response, thus leading to spatiotemporal variation in infection dynamics [8,9].",

Bats serve as reservoirs of 13 of the 15 lyssavirus species described (the only lyssavirus species that have not been isolated from bats, to date, are Mokola virus and Ikoma virus). Furthermore, recently described lyssavirus species enlarged the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses found in bats [11,12,13], suggesting that the lyssaviruses originated in these mammals and progressively diverged from a common ancestor [14,15]. In Europe, four of the lyssavirus species recognized, European bat Lyssavirus Types 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2, respectively), Bokeloh bat Lyssavirus (BBLV), the West Caucasian bat Virus (WCBV) and one tentative species, Lleida bat Lyssavirus, circulate among several bat species [12,16,17]. EBLV-1 is widely distributed throughout Europe, and two variants have distinct distributions and evolution histories: one is EBLV-1a, which has an east\u2013west distribution from Russia to France, with very little genetic variation; and the other is EBLV-1b, which exhibits a south\u2013north distribution and far more genetic diversity [18].",

            "text": "Different studies showed that lyssavirus dynamics exhibits a strong seasonal pattern [8] and that the breeding period could favor the infection of bats [19,20,21]. Many bat species roost in very large and dense maternity colonies. This dense clustering of individuals can provide large opportunities for viral exchange in bat colonies [10]. Previous studies have observed a higher seroprevalence in multispecies colonies compared to monospecific colonies, suggesting that interspecific virus transmission plays an important role in EBLV-1 dynamics [22]. However, in some cases, infection cycles may be maintained among specific host species and transmission may be minimal among sympatric bats [9]. Furthermore, differences in the ecological behavior of species (e.g., migration, torpor) can drive different bat infection dynamics. In this sense, a higher number of species might not only increase the rates of contact between bat groups, but could also facilitate virus entry or spread through the higher mobility of individuals among colonies, especially if there are migratory species involved [22].",

Our previous investigations have analyzed the temporal dynamics of lyssavirus in one bat species (Myotis myotis) roosting in two colonies [23,24]. The present report is based on a long-term (nine years) longitudinal study of the prevalence of EBLV-1 neutralizing antibodies and provides the first report on the inter-annual dynamics of EBLV-1 in P. austriacus and T. teniotis, both being bat species scarcely studied hitherto. We chose this locality, because we found three species (P. Pipistrellus, P. austriacus and T. teniotis) that were EBLV-1 RNA-positive by nested Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction in the first year of study [22]. Our specific goals were: (i) to provide information about EBLV-1 seroprevalence in the wild bat community where several European bat species share the same refuge; and (ii) to compare the temporal patterns of seroprevalence mainly in two less-studied bat species that, moreover, exhibit different ecological strategies.",

After incubation of the serum-virus mixtures, a suspension of BSR cells (a clone of BHK 21 cells) was added. After 24 hours incubation, the cell monolayer was acetone-fixed and labelled with a fluoresceinated anti-nucleocapsid antibody (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). The optimal challenge dose (the dilution giving 80% infected cells for each virus production) was calculated. Titers are presented as an arithmetic mean of two independent repetitions. Serum samples with antibody titers <27 are considered negative for EBLV-1-neutralizing antibodies. This cut-off value is similar to that applied in other studies [23,24,28,29].",

In the second analysis, we used a generalized additive model (GAM) to study the temporal patterns of EBLV-1-antibody prevalence in only two species (P. austriacus and T. teniotis). More specifically, we used a generalized additive model with the binomial error distribution, where the seroprevalence was the response variable and sex, species and year (2004\u20132012) were the explanatory variables. The \u201cyear\u201d variable was modeled as a covariate fitted with penalized cubic regression splines and sex and species as a fixed categorical factor. To avoid over-fitting and to retain more easily interpretable relationships in the GAM smoothing function, an upper limit of 4 degrees of freedom was set for the year variable when fitting the models. We used an information-theoretic procedure and the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) to compare models [30]. Modeling was performed using the \u201clme4\u201d and \u2018\u2018mgcv\u2019\u2019 packages in the R program v. 2.14 [31].",

This difference may be due to the gregarious behavior of female bats in summer (nursing colonies are composed almost exclusively of adult females). In these colonies, virus transmission may be favored by high contact rates during social grooming, nursing or olfactory or lingual contact with body fluids. Reproductive activity may also play a role in virus transmission [19], because an increased susceptibility to infectious disease during pregnancy and lactation has been demonstrated in bats [34] and other mammals [35]. However, we report in this study no sex differences of EBLV-1 seroprevalence. The presence of males in this cavity during summer could indicate that males also are present in maternity colonies, as observed in P. austriacus colonies, or roost near these colonies.",

            "text": "Significant fluctuations in the percentage of seropositive bats are indicative of several different episodes of EBLV-1 infection occurring in P. austriacus and T. teniotis colonies during the period of study. A quick increase and a high seropositive percentage after a lyssavirus episode are not unusual in a gregarious behavior species and could explain the sudden increase in the percentage of seropositive bats in T. teniotis and P. austriacus colonies. A similar quick increase with seropositive peaks of 60%\u201370% was observed in different colonies of M. myotis in Mallorca [23,24]. However, in M. myotis colonies, the evolution of seroprevalence after infection peaks follows a more gradual decline over subsequent years, until a new episode takes place, very different from what is observed here. The delay between the waves is then dependent on the rate of inflow of susceptible bats into the colonies as a consequence of new births, bat immigration from neighboring colonies and the expiration of EBLV-1-specific immunity in previously infected animals [23]. When a sufficient fraction of susceptible bats in the colony is reached, the virus spreads again if infected individuals join the colony. In the T. teniotis and P. austriacus colonies, the increase of seroprevalence is followed by a rapid decline until seropositive bats are not detected. The difference in the seropositive percentage evolution can be due to a higher rate of inflow of individuals in colonies of T. teniotis and P. austriacus. No data of inflow are available on T. teniotis, but very few recaptures were obtained during the study, indicating probably a high inflow rate in this colony. However, recapture rates in the P. austriacus colony were higher, suggesting a lower inflow in this species. Another hypothesis could be a different lifespan of immunity in these species. Recent studies estimated the lifespan of the M. myotis immunity from EBLV-1 to be around two years [36]. In this respect, it is possible that the immunity lifespan would be shorter in P. austriacus and T. teniotis than in M. myotis.",

Annual fluctuations could result from the behavioral ecology of the species involved [9]. T. teniotis and P. austriacus are two species with a different social organization and behavior. While T. teniotis forms large maternity colonies and can make long seasonal movements, P. austriacus forms smaller maternity colonies constituted by both sexes and makes shorter seasonal movements [37]. Different host ecology, behavior and movement could explain the different temporal variations in seroprevalence in these two species. Changes in density during migration or colony formation may affect contact rates and, thus, disease dynamics [9,38].",

Higher EBLV-1 seroprevalence was observed in large and multispecies colonies compared to smaller and monospecific colonies, suggesting that interspecific virus transmission plays an important role in dynamics. A higher number of species might not only increase the rates of contact between bat groups, but could also facilitate virus entry or spread through the higher mobility of individuals among colonies, especially if there are migratory species [22]. In this sense, M. schreibersii (a species that often shares roost with M. myotis) has been considered as a regional reservoir and an essential species for EBLV-1 persistence in the Balearic Islands [36].",

However, previous studies of bat rabies surveillance in Europe did not find EBLV-1-neutralizing antibodies in both species of Pipistrellus (for review see [39,40]). These results could be indicative of a low public health risk associated with these synanthropic species. Furthermore, the lack of a standardized serological test procedure, including arbitrary cut-off values, makes the comparison between previous European studies difficult. However, the higher values of EBLV-1 seroprevalence in our study could be due to differences in virus circulation and dynamics resulting from regional differences or selection of different types of colony (large multispecies maternity colonies in this case) [39,40]. Research programs that focus mainly on multi-host systems will help advance our understanding of the ecology of bat diseases.",

These results suggest that most bats species roosted in this cave were exposed to the EBLV-1 lyssavirus. The evolution of seroprevalence in T. teniotis and P. austriacus colonies after infection peaks is different from that observed in M. myotis colonies. Differences in behavior ecology and population dynamics among bat species could explain the differences in the inter-annual variability of EBLV-1 seroprevalence.",
