The frequency was similar to that described by other authors [13]. A higher prevalence of symptomatic WUPyV or KIPyV infections was found in the symptomatic population than in the control group. Although the data suggest that their detection in respiratory samples is sporadic and often associated with other microorganisms, we should pay special attention to their association with cases of graft failure. Patients infected with WUPyV and KIPyV had varying degrees of immunosuppression, because they appeared in different stages of the post-transplantation period, which suggests that severe immune compromise is not necessarily a risk factor for the infection or reactivation.",
