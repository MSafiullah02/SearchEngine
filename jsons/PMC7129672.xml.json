While most developed countries focused on these, disease due to Lassa, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever viruses continued unabated. Other emergent pathogens such as severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, and Powassan virus remain restricted in scope. When, in 2014, Ebola was detected in the capital cities of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the potential for a global pandemic expanding from travellers from affected regions or repatriation of infected health-care workers became a real concern. Ebola recalled the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in Hong Kong and Toronto and raised alarm during the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea. And Zika, previously considered as self-limited, was newly associated with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and fetal abnormalities.2\n",

Even for Ebola, despite three decades of vaccine research, human trials were limited to two vaccine candidates in the early to mid-2000s.4, 5 Second, vaccine trials occurred during epidemics with an evolving epidemiology. And third, while funding materialised to combat each outbreak, interest and financial support waned as case prevalences fell and imminent danger receded. These issues highlighted the urgent need for a coordinated and consistent approach to vaccine development for emerging and emergent pathogens.",

As the authors note, the accuracy of self-reported cost figures are unknown; also the prevalence of reporting was not provided. For some disease programmes, cost data might be rudimentary because work is ongoing. The cost of development through phase 2a, not including the initial discovery, was calculated as US$31\u201368. Including the risk of candidate non-advancement, costs per successful candidate could range from $319 to 469 million, consistent with cost estimates through licensure of $2\u00b75 billion per successful candidate.8 Using these cost estimates, the total portfolio cost to advance at least one candidate vaccine through to phase 2a for each of the 11 target pathogens was $3\u00b75\u20135\u00b72 billion; a point at which stockpiling could conceivably occur.",

CEPI's funding model of parallel development of multiple candidates and a focus on platforms with previous known success are key to limiting time and cost. Another area not considered here is the ability to do efficacy trials, which might not be feasible for uncommon or geographically dispersed diseases such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, Powassan virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, although a potential solution might be to consider group-specific approvals on the basis of success of a vaccine platform for related viruses. Finally, the CEPI model provides the impetus for early-phase vaccine development for diseases with unknown commercial return; solutions to encourage development through licensure are, however, still needed.",
