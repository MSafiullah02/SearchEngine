Using examples with direct links to students\u2019 lives may raise their interest in the topic (Hillis 2007), increase their motivation to learn (National Research Council 2003), and encourage them to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math careers (STEM), as urgently recommended to bolster America\u2019s scientific and technological infrastructure (Project Kaleidoscope 2006). Unfortunately, bringing current issues and events into the science classroom is often a challenge. Textbooks aim to keep up with advances in the field, but they are often thwarted by the rapid pace at which science moves. Scientific journals that describe cutting-edge, relevant evolutionary research come out daily\u2014but it is difficult for most science teachers to translate these often complex and jargon-filled articles into something appropriate for the classroom. And, at the most basic level, the concerns and issues of interest to students and society are continually evolving. By the time that instructors have access to science teaching materials leveraging student interest in, for example, an emerging virus like swine flu or SARS, the threat and interest level are likely to have waned. How is a teacher to keep up?",

            "text": "The Evo in the News program circumvents these problems and lag times by providing a freely available suite of teaching resources (including lessons, readers, and video podcasts) on basic evolutionary concepts that capitalize on current events and come out on a monthly basis during the school year. Some Evo in the News briefs cover a hot topic in evolutionary research that has made it into the popular press in the preceding month (e.g., the discovery of Tiktaalik or new research on the origins of HIV; Daeschler et al. 2006; Worobey et al. 2008). In these cases, Evo in the News provides an explanation of the research in student-friendly terms, addresses the basic evolutionary concepts behind the research, and explains its relevance and importance. Of course, when some outlets in the popular media distort or misrepresent evolutionary research (e.g., when the discovery of a new hominid fossil is erroneously heralded as \u201cchallenging evolutionary theory\u201d; Borenstein 2007; Spoor et al. 2007), Evo in the News explains the science behind the hype and why particular evolutionary issues are likely to be misinterpreted. Other news briefs address issues in the news that do not at first seem to have anything to do with evolution to reveal the \u201cevolution behind the scenes\u201d\u2014which frequently gets short shrift in the popular press. For example, during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Evo in the News provided an evolutionary perspective on cancer; after major methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks, Evo in the News explained the evolution of this bacterial strain; and when six medical workers were sentenced to death in a Libyan trial, Evo in the News dealt with the evolutionary evidence that should have exonerated them. All concepts and news stories addressed are appropriate for high school, advanced placement biology, and/or college biology classes.",

For example, the April 2009 story on the evolution behind biofuel production featured an interview with Sydnor Withers of the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, who explained how his laboratory uses directed evolution to develop ways of building biofuels more efficiently (Fig. 3). These interviews provide students with a glimpse into the process of science and help give science a human face, while reinforcing central evolutionary concepts discussed in the news brief.\n",

Some teachers may wish to use Evo in the News as it comes out every month, in order to bring current events into the classroom and incorporate evolution throughout the semester or school year. Others may choose to match selected news items to particular topics in their curricula. For example, a lesson about how genes code for proteins might be supplemented by the April 2007 news story on the evolution of lactose tolerance, which addresses the same topic; a lesson on the immune system could be supplemented by the March 2007 news story on why HIV presents such a challenge to vaccine developers; and a lesson on classification could be supplemented by the March 2008 story on the discovery of a new mammal species and how the classification of that group of organisms has changed over time as scientists have learned more about their evolutionary history. To locate Evo in the News items appropriate for a specific topic, visit the Understanding Evolution general lesson search engine (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/search/search.php), enter the topic of interest in the keyword search box, and select resources tagged \u201cEvo in the News\u201d (Table 1). To locate Evo in the News items that deal with particular evolutionary concepts, visit the concept search engine, find the grade level and concept you are interested in teaching, select \u201cSee Lessons,\u201d and view resources tagged \u201cEvo in the News\u201d (Table 2).\n\n",

This might be as straightforward as having students read a news brief, watch the podcast as a class, and turn in their answers to the discussion questions. Other teachers might prefer a more elaborate and open-ended implementation. For example, over the course of a few weeks, students and their teacher could explore several different news briefs. The teacher could then provide students with a popular press story with a hidden evolution connection and ask students to research and write a short explanation of this connection. Or students could be challenged to find their own news stories with an evolution connection and present them to the class. The possibilities are wide-ranging, and the supplementary teaching tools that come with each news brief are designed to support a variety of implementations.",

In response, discussion questions and links to supporting lessons, activities, and readers were added.
