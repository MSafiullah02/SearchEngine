            "text": "Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is a new emerging disease affecting pigs primarily at 5 to 18 weeks of age. This disease was first identified within high-health herds in Western Canada in 1991 (Clark, 1997) and now is considered to be endemic in many swine-producing countries of the world (Allan and Ellis, 2000). Pigs affected with PMWS show weight loss, dyspnea, tachypnea, anemia, diarrhea, and jaundice. Characteristic macroscopic findings are enlargement of lymph nodes and noncollapsed lungs with tan mottling. Microscopic lesions can be detected in a number of tissues, the most characteristic being those of lymphoid tissues. These lesions consist of lymphocyte depletion of follicular and interfollicular areas together with macrophage infiltration of lymphoid tissues. Other common lesions described for PMWS include interstitial pneumonia, periportal to diffuse hepatitis, and interstitial nephritis (Clark, 1997, Rosell et al., 1999). Isolation of virus from tissues of affected pigs led to the identification of a porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), considered to be of etiological importance in PMWS (Allan et al., 1999, Ellis et al., 1998, Hamel et al., 1998, Meehan et al., 1998, Morozov et al., 1998). Porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) was originally identified as a contaminant of porcine kidney cell cultures (PK15 ATCC CCL-33) (Tischer et al., 1982) and is nonpathogenic to pigs (Allan et al., 1995, Tischer et al., 1982).",

            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is classified in the genus Circovirus of the Circoviridae family (Pringle, 1999). The PCV virion is icosahedral, non-enveloped, and 17 nm in diameter. The genome of PCV is a single-stranded circular DNA of about 1.76 kb. The overall DNA sequence homology within the PCV1 or PCV2 isolates is greater than 90%, while the homology between PCV1 and PCV2 isolates is 68\u201376%. Two major open reading frames (ORFs) have been recognized for PCV, ORF1, called rep gene, which encodes a protein of 35.7 kDa involved in virus replication (Mankertz et al., 1998), and ORF2, called cap gene, which encodes the major immunogenic capsid protein of 27.8 kDa (Cheung, 2003a, Nawagitgul et al., 2000). In addition to the replicase ORF1 and the capsid protein ORF2, a novel protein, ORF3, has been detected in PCV2 productive infection and is not essential for PCV2 replication in cultured cells but is involved in virus-induced apoptosis (Liu et al., 2005). ORF2 protein has been demonstrated to stimulate protective responses to injected pigs with baculovirus-expressed product or DNA prepared from the gene (Blanchard et al., 2003, Kamstrup et al., 2004). Furthermore, other studies have shown that chimeric PCV1\u20132 virus with the immunogenic ORF2 capsid gene of pathogenic PCV2 cloned into the nonpathogenic PCV1 genomic backbone as well as an attenuated PCV2 after 120 passages could induce specific antibody responses (Fenaux et al., 2004a, Fenaux et al., 2004b). However, there is a great need for the development of a new therapy for PCV2 infection.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural process by which double-stranded RNA directs sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing (Fire, 1999, Hammond et al., 2001a, Hammond et al., 2001b, Sharp, 2001). Specific inhibition of endogenous or pathogen mRNA by RNAi can be triggered by the introduction of 21\u201323 nucleotide (nt) duplexes of RNA (siRNA) or by transcription of DNA precursor into short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) homologous to target sequences (Brummelkamp et al., 2002, Elbashir et al., 2001a, Paddison et al., 2002), opening up possibilities for controlling replicative processes of pathogens. This discovery promoted the use of RNAi for specifically inhibiting gene expression and replication of infectious viruses. Over the past years, RNAi approaches have shown to be effective against a variety of viruses in cell culture, among these are prominent viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (Capodici et al., 2002), influenza virus (Ge et al., 2003), poliovirus (Gitlin et al., 2002), severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Wang et al., 2004), herpes virus (Jia and Sun, 2003), human papillomavirus (Hamel et al., 1998), dengue virus (Caplen et al., 2002), and West Nile virus (McCown et al., 2003). Synthetic siRNAs as well as shRNAs transcribed in vivo from DNA templates have been shown to be potent inhibitors of gene expression in adult mice (McCaffrey et al., 2003). Studies in mice injected with shRNAs or siRNAs directed against hepatitis B virus have raised expectations about the use of RNAi as an antiviral strategy (Giladi et al., 2003, McCaffrey et al., 2003). Furthermore, siRNAs or DNA vectors produced shRNAs have also been shown to reduce the influenza viral load in murine lungs and increase survival (Ge et al., 2004, Tompkins et al., 2004). Recently, there is a report that administration of siRNAs to mice before West Nile virus infection has reduced the viral load and offered partial protection from lethal infection (Bai et al., 2005). PCV2 has been demonstrated to cause lymphoid lesions of infected BALB/c mice characterized by expansion of germinal centers in lymphoid organs with large numbers of histiocytic cells and lymphoblasts, apoptosis of histiocytic cells, and lymphoid depletion (Kiupel et al., 2001), which is consistent with that of PCV2-infected pigs. Therefore, this model system offers the opportunity to test the ability of RNAi to inhibit replication of PCV2 in vivo.",

The PK15 cells were transfected with the shRNA-expressing plasmids and then infected with PCV2, and the levels of PCV2 viral protein production were determined by IFA at 48 h after infection. The time points for measuring the effects of shRNA in cells were chosen following preliminary optimization experiments (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of the inhibition, pVP2, an shRNA-expressing plasmid directed against porcine parvovirus viral sequence, was used as a negative control in the experiments. The results showed that all shRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the PCV2 genome caused a decrease in PCV2 antigen levels to varying degrees (Figs. 1B and C). Among these specific shRNAs, pSIR3 and pSIR6 exhibited the highest level of inhibition (Figs. 1B and C). Therefore, we chose these two shRNA-expressing plasmids for the following experiments. In contrast to the PCV2-specific shRNAs, the control pVP2 had no effect on PCV2 antigen level in the treated cells, indicating that inhibition by the PCV2-targeted shRNAs was specific and due to RNAi.",

The results showed that, at concentrations of 1500 to 2500 ng shRNA-expressing plasmid per 5 \u00d7 104 cells, the highest level of inhibition (fivefold) of viral antigen was obtained with pSIR3 and pSIR6 plasmids, whereas pVP2 had no effect (Fig. 2A).

The amount of each viral mRNA was normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA in the same sample. The abundance of ORF1 and ORF2 mRNAs was significantly reduced in PCV2-infected cells transfected with pSIR3- or pSIR6-expressing plasmids (Fig. 3A). shRNAs are known to be incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex and to direct RNA-induced silencing complex-mediated sequence-specific mRNA degradation (Hammond et al., 2000). ORF1 and ORF2 of PCV2 have been demonstrated to contain different mRNA, but their mRNA levels were reduced in the PCV2-infected cells regardless of ORF1 or ORF2 shRNA transfection. One possible explanation for the effects of this coordination is that the target mRNA bound with a shRNA might affect the other non-target mRNA of the virus through a downstream effect on all the viral transcripts because viral replication is inhibited, but the detailed mechanism of this process remains unclear.",

Microscopic alterations in PCV2 alone mice were first noticed at day 5 post-infection, slight germinal centers developed in the parenchyma of the inguinal lymph nodes (data not shown). At 11 days post-infection, the mice developed prominent germinal centers that consisted of large lymphoblastic cells and histiocytic cells, and the paracortex had loss of lymphocytes and was infiltrated by large numbers of histiocytes (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the lymph nodes showed normal microscopic morphology in treated mice with pSIR3 or pSIR6 at 5 days post-infection as seen in that of mock-infected mice (data not shown). At 11 days post-infection, mice treated with pSIR3 or pSIR6 showed significantly lower (P < 0.05) lesion scores than that of untreated mice and showed a considerable reduction in inguinal lymph node lesions, as evidenced by decreases in the lymphocytes and in the number of infiltrating histiocytes compared to controls (Figs. 5B and C). In addition, the nonspecific pVP2 shRNA did not attenuate the lymph node lesions induced by PCV2 infection at 5 and 11 days post-infection (data not shown).

Positive cells typically exhibited a dark purple to black reaction product in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Figs. 6A and B). Lymph node sections from mice receiving pSIR3 had significantly reduced numbers of positive cells (P < 0.05), with 1.2 \u00b1 0.5% of stained cells (Fig. 6C). The number of stained cells in sections from pSIR6-treated mice was also significantly reduced (P < 0.05, 1.6 \u00b1 1.2% of infected cells) (Fig. 6D). In contrast, the number of positive cells in sections of mice treated with pVP2 RNAi did not show any reduction (P > 0.05, 8.5 \u00b1 2.3%) (Fig. 6E). No staining was seen in sections from mock-infected mice (Fig. 6F). These results demonstrate that PCV2 shRNA can inhibit the PCV2 DNA replication in vivo.",

The ability to silence mammalian gene expression using siRNA opens new and exciting routes to the understanding of mammalian cell biology and its pathology. There are many precedents for RNAi being effective against a wide range of viral pathogens in vitro. In addition, RNAi has been demonstrated to be functional in mice and can inhibit viral replication and expression when injected with specific siRNAs against hepatitis B and influenza viruses (Ge et al., 2004, Giladi et al., 2003, McCaffrey et al., 2003, Uprichard et al., 2005). These studies have shown that RNAi can potentially be used as a therapeutic or prophylactic mechanism against viruses. Here, we have provided evidence that shRNAs targeting the ORF1 and ORF2 regions of PCV2 are capable of inhibiting all the steps of PCV2 infection in cultured cells, which support viral production, and in vivo in a mouse model.",

In this study, to test which region of the PCV2 genome is the most effective site for siRNA targeting, six different anti-PCV2 shRNAs were selected at the ORF1 and ORF2 genes that have important functions in viral replication and production, respectively. After testing the effect of these vector-based siRNAs on the inhibition of PCV2 replication in cultured PK15 cells, we found that all six shRNAs could cause a decrease in PCV2 replication to varying degrees, with two of them being more effective. These results may be due to different positional accessibility caused by steric hindrance by a secondary or tertiary structure and/or protein binding (Kamstrup et al., 2004). We also noticed that the nonspecific pVP2-expressing plasmid has some inhibitory effect on PCV2 replication after being transfected at higher concentration. This could be due to the non-gene-specific suppression of siRNA. Higher concentrations of siRNA have been demonstrated to exhibit more measurable nonspecific gene suppression activity (Persengiev et al., 2004). Therefore, identifying highly active siRNAs and decreasing siRNA concentrations can alleviate some nonspecific effects while maintaining efficient silencing.",

In this study, we used real-time RT-PCR to detect ORF1 or ORF2 mRNA level after being transfected with pSIR3- or pSIR6-expressing plasmids and found that not only can shRNA significantly reduce its corresponding mRNA level but inhibit other viral gene transcription as well (Fig. 3A). This could be related to the life cycle of the virus. It can be assumed that the PCV2-specific shRNA first recognizes the corresponding sequence of the viral mRNA and initiates the degradation of this mRNA. As a consequence, the degradation of the mRNA results in blockage of the corresponding protein synthesis, i.e., silencing of viral gene expression. Thus, the amount of newly synthesized mature virions might have been reduced in the subsequent virus infection. Therefore, significant inhibition in other mRNA level could be due to reduction of newly synthesized mature virions induced by shRNA when it does not directly target this mRNA. This hypothesis has been further confirmed by the data that viral DNA was reduced in supernatants of transfected cells (Fig. 3B) and PCV2 protein synthesis was inhibited in transfected cells (Fig. 4C).",

Introducing a single nucleotide change to the siRNA sequence could abrogate siRNA-mediated silencing. To clarify this question, we performed evaluations using a series of pSIR3 mutants containing point mutations at different locations. The data (Figs. 4B and C) suggest that point mutations in the middle and 3\u2032-end sequence of pSIR3 sense strand could eliminate the anti-PCV2 activity probably due to a decrease in the affinity of the siRNA for the target mRNA (Schwarz et al., 2003), whereas the point mutation of the 5\u2032-end sequence did not interfere with the antiviral activity. Sequence specificity of siRNA is very stringent as single base pair mismatches between the siRNA and its target sequence can dramatically reduce the silencing capability (Elbashir et al., 2001a, Elbashir et al., 2001b, Yuan et al., 2005). However, the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon needs to be further studied. In addition, it has been demonstrated that escaping mutants were generated following siRNA or shRNA treatment (Boden et al., 2003, Gitlin et al., 2002, Gitlin et al., 2005), this can be prevented by treatment with multiplex specific siRNAs or targeting long portions of the viral genome. In this study, we also performed three passages of PCV2 on newly pSIR3-expressing plasmid-transfected cells to investigate whether escaping PCV2 mutants were generated, but did not detect any mutants (data not shown), suggesting that the pSIR3 targeting sequence is a critical site for the fitness of the virus. Therefore, this kind of targeting sequence as pSIR3 can be used as targets for designing siRNA in PCV2 therapy.",

To prolong the expression of siRNA, a plasmid or an integrating viral vector expressing endogenous siRNA can be used to achieve this purpose (McCaffrey et al., 2003, Uprichard et al., 2005). Such vector-based strategies with generation of siRNA may be used to test inhibition or suppression of viral gene expression and replication in animal models and permit greater understanding of the role and activity of viral genes in vivo. By contrast to that PCV2 was capable of replicating in BALB/c mice and caused microscopic lesions (Kiupel et al., 2001), Quintana et al., (2002) reported that no microscopic lesions compatible with PCV2 infections in pigs were detected in inoculated mice, but it might be due to the inoculum of the dosage and administration route (Quintana et al., 2002). In the present study, we observed enlargement of germinal centers by infiltration with large numbers of lymphoblastic and histiocytic cells, apoptosis of histiocytes, and lymphocytic depletion in the paracortex of lymph nodes in PCV2-inoculated BALB/c mice (Fig. 5A and data not shown) which resembled early lesions in lymph nodes in PCV2-inoculated gnotobiotic pigs. Furthermore, PCV2 replication was confirmed by the amounts of viral DNA and protein synthesis in the lymph nodes (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) as well as other tissues (data not shown) in the PCV2-inoculated mice. Therefore, we used BALB/c mice as an animal model for inhibiting PCV2 infection by RNAi in vivo. The study described herein shows that RNAi induced by plasmid-borne small interfering RNAs can be used to inhibit replication of a porcine pathogen in a mouse model system for 12 days after injection. The antiviral treatment decreased viral expression in the inguinal lymph node and attenuated lymph node lesions in PCV2-infected mice and thus may be applicable as a therapeutic strategy for naturally occurring PCV2 infection.",
