Objective: We sought to explore the relationship between viral infections, host and environmental factors, and respiratory symptoms in children. Methods: Sixty-seven asthmatic children collected samples twice weekly for an average of 10 weeks. These included nasal wash fluid and exhaled breath for PCR-based detection of viral RNA, lung function measurements, and records of medication use and asthma and respiratory symptoms in the previous 3 days. Atopy, mite allergen exposure, and vitamin D levels were also measured. Mixed-model regression analyses were performed. Results: Human rhinoviruses (hRVs) were detected in 25.5% of 1232 nasal samples and 11.5% of breath samples. Non-hRV viruses were detected in less than 3% of samples. hRV in nasal samples was associated with asthma symptoms (cough and phlegm: odds ratio 5 2.0; 95% CI 5 1.4-2.86, P 5 .0001; wheeze and chest tightness: odds ratio 5 2.34, 95% CI 5 1.55-3.52, P < .0001) and with cold symptoms, as reported concurrently with sampling and 3 to 4 days later. No differences were found between the 3 hRV genotypes (hRV-A, hRV-B, and hRV-C) in symptom risk. A history of inhaled corticosteroid use, but not atopic status, mite allergen exposure, or vitamin D levels, modified the association between viruses and asthma symptoms. Conclusion: The detection of nasal hRV was associated with a significantly increased risk of day-to-day asthma symptoms in children. Host, virus genotype, and environmental factors each had only a small or no effect on the relationship of viral infections to asthma symptoms. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2015;135:663-9.)

Exhaled breath contains particles that are generated mostly in the lower airways. 11 We have developed a simple method for self-sampling viral RNA in exhaled breath, 12, 13 which is suitable for use by children, and used this as a proxy for lower respiratory tract infection. There is also considerable evidence that the severity of asthma symptoms that occur in association with hRV infection differs according to the genotype of the infecting organism.

This finding of relatively weak but highly significant associations between virus nasal positivity and day-to-day asthma symptoms contrasts with previous reports of strong associations between the presence of respiratory viruses and the occurrence of acute exacerbations of asthma. For example, in an emergency department study, odds ratios of 31.5 (95% CI, 8.3-108; P < .001) have been reported for the risk of acute wheezing in highly mite atopic children with an hRV infection compared with those seen in virus-negative children 37 and 19.4 (95% CI, 3.7-101.5; P 5.001) for the combination of atopy, allergen exposure, and viral infection for hospital admission compared with those in patients with stable asthma.

These aerosols of viral RNA have previously been detected by us and others using a variety of methods. 11, [41] [42] [43] It is unknown whether differences in the detection of viral RNA in exhaled samples compared with nasal samples was due to the virus being present less frequently in the exhaled samples or because of the smaller volume of airway fluid in these samples.

Similar approaches have analyzed asthma-related health effects associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide, 25 particulates, 47 and pollen. 48 Our estimation of the population attributable risk can be interpreted to mean that if respiratory virus exposure was eliminated from this population, the risk of day-to-day asthma symptoms would only decrease by 6% to 10%.

For example, the lowest quartile of mite exposure was associated with increased cough, whereas other data suggest mite exposure is positively associated with cough. 55, 56 Similarly, our finding that a vitamin D level of greater than the cut point of 50 nmol/L was associated with increased wheeze is inconsistent with most data that higher vitamin D levels are associated with better respiratory outcomes. 24 Whether the enhanced immune response to viral infection associated with higher vitamin D levels is also associated with increased wheeze requires further study. The most surprising finding was the lack of interaction with atopy. This is in contrast to several cohort studies that show a synergy between asthma exacerbations and viruses, either alone 22, 37, 57 or in combination with allergen exposure. 23, 58 However, in the longitudinal cohort study most comparable in structure to ours, 6 the effect of sensitization on symptoms was most evident with severe symptoms, and this would not be identified by using our analysis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 617, "end": 620, "text": "55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1215, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1219, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1268, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 368, "text": "Table V", "ref_id": null}], "section": "TABLE V.

Another reason might be that our study routinely monitored all viruses and day-to-day symptoms and used a mixed-model analysis; such findings might differ from observations based on exacerbations in large populations. In a sample of this size, we were not able to investigate the potential contribution of different asthma phenotypes, which in this age group have largely been studied among children with severe asthma. 59 In conclusion, this study identifies the clinical significance of hRVs in day-to-day asthma and respiratory symptoms in children but does not confirm the role any of the host, viral, or environmental factors thought to modify the role of hRV in patients with acute asthma exacerbations. However, given the complexity of clinical asthma, the differences in phenotypes, the multiplicity of factors that can modulate symptoms, the diverse clinical responses to viral infections, and the likely variation in the pathogenicity of individual strains of hRV, a better understanding of the role of viruses presents new challenges for longitudinally monitoring both the causal factors and the associated clinical outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 383, "end": 386, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TABLE V.
