Their analysis focused particularly on biomedical research, but the issues are general to biotech research applications, including agricultural and veterinary medicinal. They used the term \u201ctragedy of the anticommons\u201d in contrast with the \u201ctragedy of the commons,\u201d which popularized the observation that common property resources are overexploited because no one has a preservation incentive (Hardin 1968). While the \u201ccommons\u201d concept argues for privatization, Heller and Eisenberg (1998, p. 698) cautioned that overprivatization creates fragmented ownership and high transaction costs\u2014an anticommons. \u201cPrivatization can solve one tragedy but cause another.\u201d",

Reductions in access to past developments diminish current and all future research productivity. Economists explain those reductions in terms of transactions costs: more and potentially overlapping patents increase the costs of negotiating access, which causes further declines in output. That point is well documented at a theoretical level. Less well documented is the empirical question: if more patents increase transaction costs for researchers, do they indeed cause an anticommons? This article summarizes the available evidence.",

The patent numbers referred to here are on the conservative side\u2014what the authors refer to as a \u201cwide net\u201d\u2014so that it is possible the core patent rights (which would need to be negotiated) would be smaller in number.

And that is before the ongoing changes typical in corporate licensing arrangements. At a more aggregate level, Jenson and Murray (2005) evaluated the number of human genes that were patented. They determined that nearly 20% of human genes were explicitly claimed, or 4382 of 23,688 genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database at the time of writing. This number of patented genes is less than reported in prior studies, according to the authors, because only genes claimed in the patents were counted, not those merely disclosed. The 4000+ patented genes had 1156 owners; about two thirds of these were private firms. Two genes had up to 20 patents claiming various form and use rights, but more than 3000 (68%) only had a single rights holder. For the 144 genes with five or more rights holders (3%), there is a real potential of a costly licensing process to secure access, but less so for the great majority. Unsurprisingly, the heavily patented genes are associated with human health and diseases, making them particularly important research targets.",

The unanimous June 2013 decision bans patents on naturally occurring DNA segments (\u201cisolated DNA\u201d) as products of nature while permitting them for complementary DNA (cDNA), which is not naturally occurring. As part of their ruling, the justices quoted a lower court decision that allowing patents for isolated DNA would create a \u201cconsiderable danger\u201d that \u201cpatents would \u2018tie up\u2019 the use of such tools and thereby \u2018inhibit future innovation premised upon them\u2019 (p. 2116).\u201d Indeed, the patent validity case was brought by a researcher who used a different diagnostic lab to perform the genetic testing but ceased after receiving a warning letter from Myriad Genetics. Note should be made though that the plaintiff was involved with commercial use of Myriad\u2019s invention, not research access. Indeed, in its court filings, Myriad pledged to grant open research access to its then-patented genes, balking only at use by fee-charging labs.",

Both are now in the public domain, although some improvements remain under patent. This kind of broad pioneering patent grant is unlikely to be repeated in the biotech field due to an attribute of the US patent system which treats a patent as the right of an inventor. It is thus the responsibility of the USPTO (the assigned examiner) to document why a patent should be withheld, typically meaning the application is either nonnovel and/or nonobvious (35 USC 102\u2013103). What happens in new fields of endeavor\u2014as biotechnology was in the 1980s\u2014is that most applications by definition are nonobvious. To document lack of novelty, the examiner must identify a publication or use or related patent, which destroys the novelty. Again, in new fields of research, there are limited numbers of such documents so lack of novelty is difficult to establish. The consequence is broad patent grants.

The author carefully notes that infringement actions are not the sole measure of negative effects of patents\u2014the payment of royalties would be an obvious one\u2014but nonetheless provide an objective measure of the degree to which patent rights are asserted. Four categories of human gene patents are identified: (1) recombinant production of human therapeutic proteins, (2) research tools, (3) genetic testing products and services, and (4) gene therapy. Of the 4270 gene patents previously identified, only 18 were found to have been involved in six infringement actions. This is a litigation rate of 0.4%, far below the 1%\u20132% for all patents. Of the six actions, four were settled privately, one dismissed for lack of standing by the plaintiff, and one determined to be non-infringing. That is, not a single human gene patent had been determined by the courts to have been infringing. Access to research tools is of particular relevance to researchers, and all but seven infringement actions were identified in this manner. Citing a relationship between the level of litigation frequency and non-litigation impact, the author \u201cfind[s] that the impact of human gene patent litigation has been relatively modest [which] suggests that non-litigation impact is not as extensive as commonly perceived\u201d (p. 359).",

One\u2014the Genomic Research and Diagnostic Accessibility Act of 2002\u2014was a \u201climited exemption from liability for certain uses of patented genetic sequences and genetic sequence information in the context of basic research and genetic diagnostic information\u201d (Holman 2007, p. 295). The bill was not acted on by Congress and was not reintroduced when the introducing representative left office. The second would bar the patenting of any nucleotide sequence, or its functions or correlations, or the naturally occurring products it specifies (the Genomic Research and Accessibility Act of 2007). This language is very broad and ambiguous, potentially encompassing all inventions involving polynucleotides (Holman 2007). The bill never made it out of committee. Congressional action to control patent trolls has met a similar fate. Following a yearlong effort, the process was declared all but dead when patent reform was withdrawn from the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s agenda in May 2014 (Wyatt 2014).

In this sense, both the advocates of the anticommons theory and enthusiasts of patent characteristics err by oversimplifying the multidimensional character of patent dynamics.\u201d Further, commentators on the anticommons oftentimes mix the issues of the commercialization of products incorporating patented genes and testing methods with the effect of patents on research access.

Both topics are worthy of discussion, but they are not the same issue and should not be conflated.
