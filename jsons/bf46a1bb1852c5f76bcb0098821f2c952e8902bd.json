It can also be used for prophylaxis and the treatment of bleeding in patients with other diseases resulting from a factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency. The key constituents of Haemate P/Humate-P are human von Willebrand factor (VWF) and the coagulation factor, FVIII. The Haemate P/Humate-P manufacturing process is designed to purify, concentrate the desired VWF and FVIII proteins and to inactivate/ remove viruses that may potentially be present in the starting material i.e. the plasma pool for fractionation. Haemate P/Humate-P is a lyophilized product that is reconstituted with water for injection, prior to administration, to facilitate appropriate blood coagulation in patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "When Haemate P/Humate-P [formerly known as \u00d4FVIII HS\u00d5 (hepatitis safe) and \u00d4Haemate \u00d2 HS\u00d5] was licensed and introduced into the German market more than 25 years ago, the production process included a pasteurization step to inactivate transfusion-relevant viruses. The pasteurization step involved heat-treating of the stabilized product intermediate in aqueous solution at 60\u00b0C for 10 h. Since that time, several other virus reduction measures have been implemented to increase the safety margin of the final product, including the stringent selection of all donors and screening of all donations for markers and genomes of transfusion-relevant viruses. Any seropositive or virus-reactive donations are discarded. The plasma pool for fractionation is then rechecked for the presence of viruses prior to further stages of the manufacturing process. Various steps in the Haemate P/Humate-P manufacturing process inactivate or remove remaining viruses; this has been confirmed in carefully planned virusvalidation studies using viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics, including enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The concept of a virus-safe, plasma-derived product is in line with the European guideline CPMP/BWP/268/95 [1] , which addresses three complementary approaches to control potential viral contamination of biological products. These include: (i) the selection and testing of source plasma for the absence of viruses, (ii) testing the ability of the production process to remove or inactivate viruses and (iii) testing the product, at appropriate stages of production, for any contaminating viruses. In addition, the impact of new pathogens, including prions [(the causative agent of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)], which may enter the plasma pool for fractionation and present a risk to the recipients of the product, is carefully assessed. Virus validation and prion evaluation studies are performed to assess how effectively these new pathogens can be removed and/or inactivated during the manufacturing process. The main procedures aimed at reducing the load of infectious viruses emanating from plasma during the Haemate P/Humate-P manufacturing process are outlined in Fig. 1 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1231, "end": 1234, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2207, "end": 2213, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Selection and assessment of plasma for the Haemate P/Humate-P manufacturing process", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The selection and control of starting material is a major factor in the quality assurance of the Haemate P/Humate-P manufacturing process. By carefully choosing the starting material, the potential load of hazardous viruses can be reduced to a minute amount or even eliminated. Improvements that ensure the safety of the starting plasma have been achieved in the collection process itself, for example, the careful selection of donor centres and donors. Plasma is either collected by plasmapheresis (source plasma) at designated collection centres -most of them owned by and all of them audited by CSL Behring and inspected by the relevant authorities -or from whole blood donations (recovered plasma) collected by transfusion services. All donors are required to undergo a physical examination and to provide answers to a predefined questionnaire at the time of each donation. The questionnaire is used to identify any donor who could pose a risk, in terms of transmitting pathogens, and to reject their donation and defer the donor either temporarily or indefinitely depending on the risk. For source plasma donations, the first donation from an \u00d4applicant\u00d5 donor (first time donor) is initially quarantined. This quarantine can only be lifted when the donor has successfully passed a second medical history assessment and a second donation has been screened and shown to be free of transfusion-relevant viruses. These measures result in a healthy population of donors (known as \u00d4qualified\u00d5 donors) committed to donating plasma. Source plasma from donors who have not reached the status of qualified donors is not processed for further manufacturing and is therefore destroyed. Qualified donors who have not made a donation for a period of 6 months or more are considered to be applicant donors again. All donations are screened for viruses using currently approved serological and nucleic acid amplification assays. As Haemate P/Humate-P was licensed in 1981 as \u00d4Faktor FVIII HS\u00d5, several screening assays used to detect viral markers (such as virus-specific antibodies or viral antigens) have been established or significantly improved. The first-generation assay to detect antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was introduced in 1985 [2, 3] . Since then, the sensitivity of the assay has been greatly improved.

It encompasses the period during which serological screening of a donation is negative despite the sample actually containing infectious virus. This diagnostic window occurs because there is a time lapse between an individual being infected with a virus and their body\u00d5s ability to recognize the virus and subsequently generate enough specific antibody-producing cells (i.e. time to seroconvert). Therefore, plasma donations are stored in an inventory hold to address post-donation information. Source plasma, which can be obtained several times per month from each donor, is stored for at least 60 days in the inventory hold before further processing occurs. During the inventory hold period, all post-donation information relating to the donor is assessed with regard to the suitability of the stored plasma. The most important information is whether seroconversion is detected in a subsequent donation from the same donor. If seroconversion has occurred, all stored donations from that donor are removed from the inventory hold and destroyed, thus preventing potentially virus contaminated, but seronegative donations, from being processed into the plasma pool for fractionation. Any post-donation information from a whole blood donor, such as revealing a blood-borne virus infection in a recipient or components of that donation, would also result in the destruction of that donor\u00d5s stored plasma. Post-donation information also includes the results of testing for genomic material of transfusion-relevant viruses. Furthermore, if new information on the suitability of a donor is gathered during the inventory hold period, a risk assessment is performed and stored donation(s) may then be destroyed based on the assessment outcome. Therefore, by utilizing an inventory hold, donations that may present a virus-transmission risk can be identified and eliminated from the production process (Fig. 3) .

Plasma pools are released for further processing only if the test results show that the pools are non-reactive. The quality control measure implemented by CSL Behring for HCV detection is based on an analytical sensitivity of the NAT/PCR assay for plasma pool release that is considerably lower than the assay sensitivity required by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA; CPMP/BWP/390/97) for HCV [12] .

The sensitivity of these screening assays has markedly increased over the last 20 years, to a point where, for example, detection rates of HBV assays have been reduced to at least 0.15 ng HBsAg per mL [9] . Because of the delay in antibody production after viral infection, it is possible for a serology assay to generate negative results despite the presence of a high load of infectious virus. The virus load of donations is reduced to a low level by NAT/ PCR testing.

Experimental evidence suggests that all of these procedures are effective in removing or inactivating a wide range of viruses with diverse physico-chemical characteristics, including enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.
