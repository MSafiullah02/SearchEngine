HPV\u2010associated cancers are more predominant in some tissues than others: there are \u223c500,000 cases of cervical cancer reported each year. In contrast, HPV\u2010associated penile cancers are rare (\u223c40,000 cases per year), despite no evidence of a disparity in primary infection rates. This implies a difference in the propensity of HPV to form neoplastic lesions at different sites. Doorbar speculates that this is due to a graded ability of HPV to replicate in different tissues. As further evidence, HPV\u20101 causes warts but no lesions at mucosal sites. Doorbar believes that the transformation zone in the cervix may be particularly susceptible to neoplasia formation. The exact host factors responsible for the variation in HPV replication ability are unresolved.",

In addition, proliferation of the basal cells does not stop when the basement layer is complete in high\u2010risk lesions, in contrast to low\u2010risk lesions. The increased basal layer proliferation is correlated with beta\u2010catenin activity and E6 levels (13, 14).

After infection, these viruses can establish either latent (HPV, EBV, KSHV, HTLV\u20101) or chronic (HBV, HCV) infection.

Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, Kr\u00e4usslich's group was able to confirm that Vps4, an ESCRT\u2010associated ATPase, appears in bursts at sites of HIV\u20101 particle production early in Gag assembly (52).",

Thus, following primary exposure to another variant, T cell help facilitates a more rapid antibody response, including to newly encountered epitopes (66).

In addition, there are the single genome CoV vectors, which can either be constructed by target recombination or by using an infectious CoV cDNA clone derived from the TGEV genome. This system has been shown to express a foreign gene for at least 20 passages (94, 95), demonstrating its high stability. Ongoing research is exploring the possibility of manipulating the species and tissue tropism of these CoV expression systems. Enjuanes' work reveals that these CoV vectors are flexible, robust tools with the potential to aid vaccine production and gene therapy.",
