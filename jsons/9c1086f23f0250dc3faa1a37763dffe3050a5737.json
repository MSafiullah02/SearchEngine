ADEM is considered a rare autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), traditionally characterized by a monophasic course. The term ADEM encompasses postinfectious, postvaccination, and idiopathic encephalomyelitis [1] . The majority of subjects report recent infections (generally nonspecific upper respiratory tract and flu-like syndromes) or active immunization several weeks before disease onset. Typically, ADEM manifests an acute onset, with nonspecific symptoms, such as headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting with or without altered mental status. In some cases, the presentation may be severe and dramatic, requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Despite the clinical severity, the long-term prognosis is generally favorable and with complete recovery in the majority of patients.",

In pediatric ADEM, the onset is frequently preceded by exanthematous diseases [11] . Common viruses (Epstein-Barr, measles, mumps, rubella, and coxsackie B) are the most common pathogens associated with postinfectious ADEM [11] . Bacterial infections, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila, are rarely reported [12, 13] . The list of pathogens involved in ADEM is reported in Table 5 .1 [14] . The time interval between [11] . The disease has a seasonal peak in winter and spring, according to its relative infectious etiologies. The risk of developing post-immunization ADEM is significantly lower than the risk of the postinfectious one, as less than 5% of ADEM cases follow immunization [13] . Currently, vaccinations most often associated with postvaccination ADEM are measles, mumps, and rubella. The mean latency between immunization and the ADEM onset ranges from 2 to 30 days [15] .",

However, the prevailing theory suggests that it is an autoimmune disorder of the CNS, triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. Molecular sequencing has revealed that viral or bacterial microorganisms may share antigenic determinants with myelin autoantigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein (MOBP), oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and proteolipid protein (PLP). The hypothesis of molecular mimicry is supported by studies showing the presence of anti-MOG antibodies in the serum and CSF during the acute phase of the disease and their progressive decline with disease resolution. However, the pathogenetic role of these antibodies is still debated. Moreover, also IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from MBP, PLP, and MOBP, have been described. These short stretches of homologies have the capacity to activate T-cell clones via T-cell molecular mimicry, provoking a CNS autoimmune T-cell-mediated response and inflammation with subsequent demyelination [16, 17] . In addition to this mechanism, the infection may lead to a nonspecific self-sensitization of T cells against myelin autoantigens, by activation of costimulatory pathways and cytokine release [18] . This phenomenon, called \"bystander activation,\" may provoke the breakdown of T-cell tolerance. Hence, both cell-mediated and humoral effector mechanisms may play a role in the immune-mediated damage to the CNS in ADEM.",

Sometimes these perivenous lesions may coalesce, forming confluent areas. Typically, axons in the demyelinating lesions are relatively spared, but, in fatal cases of ADEM, extensive axonal damage has been observed. Axonal damage is demonstrated by an increased level of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein (TAU), which is primarily located in neuronal axons, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Impairment of consciousness is present in 46-73% of pediatric patients and in 20-56% of adult cases [21] and may require hospitalization in intensive care (43%) or use of mechanical ventilation (16%) [8] . In children, the presence of encephalopathy is included as a diagnostic criterion of ADEM, and helps to distinguish ADEM from MS [22] . Patients with GM involvement may experience more profound states of encephalopathy, as the cerebral cortex is responsible for higher levels of sensory processing. Some patients may also show irritability, confusion, and psychosis.",
