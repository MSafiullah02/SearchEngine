During the coronavirus outbreak, the risk of admission resulted to be higher compared to last year (OR 2.714), despite a comparable raw number and rate of daily admissions, highlighting the fact that those conditions considered urgent are not missed. One plausible explanation of the higher proportion of admission during the COVID-19 period is that, the \u201cfear\u201d of the virus might have reduced the number of \u201cimproper\u201d ED-accesses. Interestingly, despite the need for invasive procedures is usually intended as surrogate for appropriate urological consultation, the daily number of these procedures was reduced during the COVID-19 period.",

            "text": "These findings may have different interpretations. During the pandemic period patients might be reluctant to seek ED evaluation even when requiring prompt consultation by a specialist; as pointed out by others in this setting [4, 9]. The consequences of this scenario are difficult to estimate at this time, since more time is required to show the long-term effects of a delayed diagnosis. Common clinical scenarios presenting for urgent consultations are, for example, gross hematuria and urinary retention that often do not require admission, but prompt evaluation may prevent delay in the diagnosis of serious underlying conditions such as cancer. On the other hand, there is a common understanding that, at least in Italy, ED access may be frequently \u201cabused\u201d by the patients, that might take advantage of the service to speed up their diagnostic pathways through the public health system in case of non-urgent needs. Therefore, this number of patients is likely to be reduced during the pandemic. The importance of this aspect should not be underestimated as it demonstrates that the high proportion of unnecessary procedures performed in ordinary times, may overload the system jeopardizing healthcare management, consuming time and resources dedicated to the real needs. In our experience we found a significant difference in the diagnosis for patients presenting in the two periods of time, reflecting the aforementioned aspects: patients presenting for renal colic and testicular pain were more than halved in this year; probably a significant proportion of this reduction is represented by those patients presenting to the ED with mild and non-urgent conditions no more presenting to the ED, but even a small number of \u201cmissed\u201d diagnosis for the more serious case could have significant clinical impact that is still to be determined [13].",

However, this is the first reported experience in the urological emergency setting since the diffusion of the virus outside of China. Every country in the world is dealing with the pandemic in different ways because of its novelty and there is lack of unanimous consent on the best healthcare management strategies. It will be interesting to extend our observations to include a longer timeframe and other experiences on a regional, national and international basis. Another limitation is that Padua Hospital represents a tertiary center, which is subject to the risk of referral bias. Despite regulations limiting the movements of citizens in Italy (which do not apply to medical care), the higher risk of admission found for patients coming from other provinces confirms that our Department attracts more serious cases from outside the province. For this reason, the province of residence was included in the multivariate analysis. There might be also a number of potential unmeasured confounders limiting the comparison between the 2 years analyzed, however the exclusion in the study design of traumas and surgical complications aimed at avoiding potential confounding related to differences in lifestyle and reduction of the surgical activity caused by the \u201clock-down\u201d. We found that during the COVID-19 period, consultations performed for surgical complications were more than six times lower and no traumatic event was identified, compared to eight during the same period of time in last year.",

Urgent care should theoretically remain barely untouched; surprisingly, we demonstrated that there was a considerable reduction of urgent urological consultations performed in the first 5 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Probably a combination of postponed diagnoses and more proper access to the ED can explain this phenomenon; the consequences of this event are yet to be defined. This information will serve as a starting point for further research and healthcare management.",
