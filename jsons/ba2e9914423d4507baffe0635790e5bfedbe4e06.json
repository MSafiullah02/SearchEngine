We aimed at generating a non-functional mAb directed against NAG-2 from patients' memory B cells. Direct and competitive ELISA methods have been used to evaluate the binding of antibodies from scleroderma patients' and controls' sera to the NAG-2 peptide. IgG memory B cells were sorted, EBV transformed and cloned to obtain NAG-2-specific mAbs. Endothelial cells and fibroblasts were cultured under standard conditions and used for functional assays. Anti-NAG-2-purified antibodies obtained from patients' Ig induce endothelial cell apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation. Patients' Igs depleted of the anti-NAG-2 fraction do not exert such functional activity. Therefore, the NAG-2 molecule represents a potential novel candidate for therapeutic intervention in SSc. Here, we describe the generation of a human mAb directed against the NAG-2 molecule. Such mAb does not retain any functional property and is able to block the effect of serum pathogenetic anti-NAG-2 antibodies. The majority of SSc patients present antibodies directed against tetraspanin NAG-2 and mediate both endothelial cell apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation, features of the disease. The anti-NAG-2 human mAb we have obtained blocks signal transduction and therefore may be a potential candidate for a new treatment in SSc, a disease where the current biological therapies have little or no efficacy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease with prominent vascular damage and multi-organ fibrosis (1) . Several auto-antibodies present in the sera of patients with SSc, including anti-endothelial cells (2) and anti-fibroblasts (3) (4) (5) antibodies, may directly contribute to disease pathogenesis. The identification of pathogenetically relevant auto-antigens is a major goal in autoimmune disorders such as SSc. We have previously identified a tetraspanin transmembrane 4 superfamily member 7 (TM4SF7 or NAG-2) peptide epitope (CGVLGVGIWLAA) as a key autoantigen target of IgG auto-antibodies in SSc (6) . NAG-2 is a tetraspanin belonging to the transmembrane 4 superfamily that forms complexes with the integrins alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1; it is highly expressed on endothelial cells and on fibroblasts and seems to have a role in cell mobility and adhesion (7) . The NAG-2 peptide shares a high degree of homology with the Cytomegalovirus (hCMV)-derived protein UL94. Different infectious agents are believed to play a role in the immunopathogenesis of SSc (8) (9) (10) . We provided direct evidence for a molecular mimicry mechanism by which antibodies against a hCMV-derived protein can be linked to endothelial cell damage and fibrosis in patients with SSc (6, 11) . Indeed, affinity-purified anti-UL94 IgG antibodies derived from SSc patients' sera recognize NAG-2 in a wholecell lysate and induce apoptosis of endothelial cells upon engagement of the NAG-2-integrin complex (6) . The same antibodies are also able to cause fibroblast activation and proliferation and to induce modulation of genes involved in cell apoptosis and activation (11) .

We describe here the generation of the human mAb JB007 derived from a SSc patient, which specifically binds the NAG-2 molecule on endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Such antibody is functionally inactive since it does not induce endothelial damage and fibroblast proliferation indicating that in the Table 3 . Frequency of IgG-secreting B-cell clones specific for NAG-2 and recall antigens (see Table 2 autoreactive B-cell repertoire directed against a particular autoantigen, auto-antibodies with different functional activity are present. The use of biological therapies in SSc has been disappointing so far. Indeed, only a few cases have been treated with anti-TNF-alpha and anti-CD20 agents, giving conflicting results (21) (22) (23) . The only biological therapy specifically designed for SSc is a mAb directed against the transforming growth factor-beta, a profibrotic cytokine thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the multi-organ fibrosis typical of scleroderma. Unfortunately, such therapy seems to have no efficacy in the treatment of the disease (24) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1116, "end": 1120, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1125, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1130, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1470, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 693, "end": 700, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 788, "end": 795, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Imatinib mesylate is a small molecule inhibitor that exerts selective dual inhibition of the transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor receptors pathways (25, 26) .

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. Author contributions: ET, CL and AP conceived the idea and were the principal investigators of the Verona and Genova teams. ET performed the B-cell cloning and generated the mAb. CB screened the clones for NAG-2 specificity. MD performed some of the ELISA tests and synthesized the peptides used in the study. AP performed the FACS analysis and the mAb activity. RC advised on the preparation of the report. CL and AP wrote the article with input from ET.
