            "text": "Swine influenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by influenza A viruses that belong to Orthomyxoviridae, a family of enveloped negative-sense, segmented, single stranded RNA viruses. Based upon the major differences within the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been identified thus far (Rohm et al., 1996, Webster et al., 1992, Fouchier et al., 2005). It is recognized that influenza viruses evolve by reassortment and/or point mutation, thus giving rise to new viral subtypes with different host tropism. In April 2009, a novel swine-lineage influenza virus capable of rapid human transmission was reported, although infection with (H1N1) 2009 was not connected to pig exposure or to a contemporary infection in the swine population (Dawood et al., 2009). This novel pandemic H1N1 possessed a unique genome arrangement. Six genes, including PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS, cluster together with those belonging to the viruses identified as triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses of the North American lineage, whereas the M and NA genes are derived from Eurasian lineage swine influenza viruses (Dawood et al., 2009). Other than sporadic transmission to humans (Myers et al., 2007), classical swine influenza A viruses of the H1N1 subtype were historically distinct from avian and other mammalian influenza viruses based on host specificity, serotype, and/or genotype (Vincent et al., 2008). Swine influenza virus was first recognized as an agent of respiratory disease in pigs in 1928 (Shope, 1931), and the North American swine influenza virus-lineage genes of the pandemic virus have its genetic origins with this ancestral H1N1. Three predominant swine influenza virus subtypes are currently circulating in US swine following the emergence of the triple reassortant H3N2 in 1998: reassortant H1N1 (rH1N1), H1N2, and H3N2 and their drift mutant derivatives, all containing the triple reassortant internal gene cassette (TRIG) (for review see Vincent et al., 2008).",

The chance of cross-species transmission may lead to serious consequences in terms of human risk of infection by increasing the reservoir of the virus in addition to dramatic costs for the pork industry. Swine have been shown to possess receptors for avian and human influenza viruses in the tracheal epithelium, leading to the suggestion that the pig is a mixing vessel for the emergence of new subtypes with human pandemic potential (Ito et al., 1998, Scholtissek et al., 1993).",

In this manuscript the development of a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using TaqMan technology for the rapid and sensitive detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 matrix gene and quantification of viral nucleic acid in diagnostic samples, is reported. For this purpose, field isolates of North American swine, equine and avian influenza viruses were analyzed retrospectively as well as samples (swabs and lavage fluid) collected during an experimental in vivo infection with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)v and A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1)v isolates. Data obtained by the qRT-PCR analysis were compared with those achieved from virus isolation of the clinical samples collected during the in vivo study.",

The in vivo study was conducted in two separate groups of 4-week-old pigs inoculated with two pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolates, A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)v (pigs 551\u2013565) and A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1)v (pigs 581\u2013595), respectively, kindly provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All pigs came from a herd free of swine influenza virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). They were treated with ceftiofur crystalline free acid (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) to reduce bacterial contaminants preceding the start of the study. The two groups were housed in individual isolation rooms at A-BSL3 and cared for in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Animal Disease Center. Pigs were humanely euthanized with a lethal dose of pentobarbital (Sleepaway, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) at the appropriate time during the course of the study. Thirty pigs, 15 per group, were inoculated intratracheally with 2 \u00d7 105\n TCID50 of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)v and 2 \u00d7 105\n TCID50 of A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1)v, both isolated and prepared on MDCK cells. Five pigs remained non-challenged as negative controls. The pigs were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of a cocktail of ketamine (8 mg/kg), xylazine (4 mg/kg) and Telazol (6 mg/kg, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) followed by virus inoculation. Pigs were observed daily for clinical signs and sample collection. Nasal swabs were taken and placed in 2 ml minimal essential medium (MEM) on 0, 3, 5, and 7 dpi to evaluate nasal virus shedding and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the end of the study. Five inoculated pigs per group were euthanized on 3, 5, and 7 dpi and five control pigs were euthanized on 7 dpi. After euthanasia, each lung was lavaged with 50 ml of MEM to obtain bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL fluid). Each nasal swab sample was subsequently thawed and vortexed for 15 s, centrifuged for 10 min at 640 \u00d7 \ng and the supernatant passed through 0.45 \u03bcm filter. Subsequently, 200 \u03bcl of the nasal swab sample was then placed on confluent MDCK cells in 24-well plates to incubate for 1 h. After 1 h of incubation the sample was removed and 400 \u03bcl MEM w/TPCK trypsin was added. The plate was checked at 24 and 48 h for cytopathic effects. After 48 h, 200 \u03bcl of cell culture supernatant from each well of the 24-well plate was subsequently passed onto a confluent 48-well plate after a freeze and thaw cycle. After 48 h evidence of cytopathic effects was evaluated and presence of virus antigen confirmed by immuno-cytochemical staining with an anti-influenza A nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody as described previously (Kitikoon et al., 2006). Tenfold serial dilutions in serum-free MEM supplemented with TPCK trypsin and antibiotics were made with each BAL fluid sample. Each dilution was plated in triplicate in 100 \u03bcl volumes onto PBS-washed confluent MDCK cells in 96-well plates. Plates were evaluated for CPE between 48 and 72 h post-infection. At 72 h, plates were fixed with 4% phosphate-buffered formalin and stained using immuno-cytochemistry as above.",

There is an immediate and critical need for a rapid differential diagnostic method for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus detection in swine. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolated from humans has had limited detection in the swine population so far (http://www.oie.int/eng/en_index.htm). However, pigs are susceptible to the infection, as demonstrated by the clinical signs and viral loads that found in nasal swabs and BAL fluids at day 3, 5, and 7 dpi. Similar results have been described by others (Lange et al., 2009). It is likely that the virus will continue to jump from humans to na\u00efve pigs and may become established as an endemic infection in the swine population. In that case, two consequences will be obvious: first, a reservoir of H1N1 virus in the swine population poses an elevated risk for human infection via aerosol transmission from clinically ill pigs, and second, dramatic economic losses for the pork industry due to direct disease related costs as well as indirect market losses. The long-term consequence is the increased chance for novel reassortment between endemic swine influenza viruses and the novel H1N1 in the swine host, posing further human and animal health risks. It is apparent that pigs may be infected at least transiently with wholly avian and/or human viruses, allowing reassortment with swine viruses to acquire avian and/or human virus gene segments (Karasin et al., 2000, Ma et al., 2007). The (H1N1) 2009 underscores the potential risk to the human population of other influenza virus subtypes and genotypes with the swine influenza virus TRIG backbone. Increased surveillance and monitoring for the (H1N1) 2009 as well as other swine influenza virus in both the swine and human populations are critical to understand the dynamic ecology of influenza A viruses in susceptible host populations.",

In fact, a sensitive and specific diagnostic test is critical for the implementation of response measures to outbreaks in swine to reduce human risk of infection. The qRT-PCR assay described is able to detect the new pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viral RNA with the ability to differentiate the new lineage from the extant swine influenza viruses circulating in the North American swine population. The assay was shown to be reproducible and linear over a range of 9 orders of magnitude, from 101 to 109 RNA copies, thus ensuring an accurate measurement of (H1N1) 2009 viral loads in clinical samples. If compared with the classical gel-based RT-PCR protocol, the processing time required by TaqMan RT-PCR is shorter, the contamination risks are lower because of the lack of post-amplification steps, and the specificity is enhanced by the probe hybridization. The specificity of the (H1N1) 2009 qRT-PCR was assessed against a set of viruses associated with respiratory disease in swine, including endemic North American swine influenza virus isolates, PRCoV, TGEV, PRRSV, porcine circovirus type 2, swine adenovirus, porcine parvovirus, blue-eye paramyxovirus and pseudorabies virus. Cross-reaction was not identified in swine specimens, thus providing evidence for high fidelity of the assay for the exclusive detection of (H1N1) 2009 in clinical samples from swine. There is a potential to detect matrix genes not of the classical swine lineage, especially those of avian lineage including the avian-like Eurasian lineage viruses. Since no Eurasian avian-like matrix genes have been reported in the US, any identification of avian-like or equine-like matrix genes would be a novel finding and should be investigated by further molecular diagnostics such as sequencing. Importantly, no endemic US swine influenza viruses tested here were shown to have the Eurasian swine influenza virus-lineage matrix gene, indicating the (H1N1) 2009 virus was not circulating in the US prior to 2009 based on current knowledge. Further testing of swine influenza virus repositories at veterinary diagnostic laboratories is warranted to rule out the existence of this lineage of viruses in North America prior to 2009.",

            "text": "The (H1N1) 2009 qRT-PCR was shown to be more sensitive with respect to VI in pigs inoculated experimentally over the duration of the shedding period. Indeed, 14 samples were demonstrated to be negative by VI but positive by qRT-PCR. However, 3 nasal swabs positive by VI were negative when tested by both qRT-PCR assays. The qRT-PCR may not be more sensitive than VI early in the course of infection when viral titers are extremely low, but it is more rapid and more specific and was more sensitive later in the course of infection. Additional testing in the diagnostic laboratory setting is necessary to compare further the (H1N1) 2009 qRT-PCR with VI. Indeed, the titers of the three 2009 qRT-PCR-negative samples were very low, 100.5, 100.7 and 101.3\n TCID50/ml. VI is recognized as the gold standard for the detection of influenza viruses but is time-consuming and labor intensive, and lacks specificity; thus the qRT-PCR assay described here can be useful in (H1N1) 2009 outbreaks, experimental challenge studies, and vaccine trials as well. Although a large collection of (H1N1) 2009 virus isolates were not available in our laboratories for testing, analysis of published M-gene sequences of strains from worldwide geographical areas allowed us to pinpoint a novel lineage-specific nucleotide sequence for diagnostic development. The sensitivity of the (H1N1) 2009 qRT-PCR is comparable to the canonical USDA-validated type A influenza virus assay reported by Spackman and Suarez (2008), thus encouraging the use of both assays, first for influenza A screening, followed by differentiation and quantification of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 RNA in clinical samples as described here. In fact, while the type A influenza virus real-time RT-PCR matrix screening assay is able to detect all viral isolates tested in this study, the (H1N1) 2009 qRT-PCR selectively detects only the novel pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viral RNA. This assay can be a powerful tool in the diagnostic laboratory setting for specific simultaneous analysis of up to 96 samples on the same plate in minimal time.",
