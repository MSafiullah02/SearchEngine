However, nearly one-third of patients with documented bacterial infection had a procalcitonin below the level generally associated with bacterial infection, and one-third without bacterial infection had levels above those associated with no bacterial infection. This lack of specificity precludes dependence on this test in selecting initial treatment. If careful attention to clinical and laboratory findings suggests that a bacterial infection is not present, a low procalcitonin level might support the withholding of antibiotics. A recent meta-analysis suggested that monitoring procalcitonin levels may allow duration of antibiotic treatment to be reduced by 3\u20134 days without adversely affecting outcomes14, 44; however, careful attention to clinical details might do the same.",

In our series of cases, 17% of 259 patients admitted with that diagnosis did not even have an infection; in most of these, more careful clinical analysis and better antibiotic stewardship would have led to a correct diagnosis at admission. Another 17% had a viral infection, one-quarter of whom had a secondary bacterial infection. Although, with current PCR technology, it is relatively simple to detect viral infection, it can be much more difficult to exclude the presence of a secondary bacterial infection. Other patients who had fungal, mycobacterial and nocardial infections also were initially diagnosed with CAP, although in many there was good evidence at the time of admission that a bacterial infection was not responsible. Most important is the large group of patients \u2013 45% in this series \u2013 in whom no diagnosis could be made. All of these patients received standard antibacterial therapy on admission. Inducing sputum in the emergency department might lead to a correct diagnosis in some proportion of cases, and additional techniques might help to identify pneumococci in sputum. Routine use of an assay for serum procalcitonin level may help in diagnosis, especially by indicating patients who do not have bacterial infection. Our data show clearly that the facile use of guidelines to label all 259 patients with CAP and to treat with antibiotics is problematic. Better discriminators of bacterial infection are sorely needed.",
