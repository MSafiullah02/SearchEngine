Preventing the spread of infectious disease pandemics is a fundamental obligation of national governments; however, effective response to pandemics cannot be accomplished independently. Rather, the preparation and response to pandemics require coordinated efforts at all levels of government, in addition to international cooperation. Porous borders, mutual vulnerability, and both economic and scientific interconnectedness mean that communication, cooperation, and mutual support are needed between countries in concert with international organizations (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics Pandemic Influenza Working Group 2005).",

As a result, much of the world\u2019s population will face pandemics empty handed, without the tools needed to identify, prevent, and treat infections. While some countries are providing public health advice and emergency response support, others are simultaneously imposing protectionist measures to isolate affected countries. Consequently, poorer countries may see no alternative but to impose disproportionate measures of their own, which may include applying domestic containment strategies that breach human rights (McDougall and Wilson 2007) or withholding biological information and virus samples needed to track and combat infectious diseases (The Lancet 2007). It has been argued that the international community, and in particular Canada and other countries of the G8 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has a shared responsibility to make good on its legal obligations to enhance global health collaboration and moral commitments to equal human worth and dignity (Labonte, Schrecker, and Sen Gupta 2005).",

These data were collected prior to, and during, the H1N1 influenza pandemic, which makes this a unique set of data owing to the participants\u2019 exposure to media and public health messaging prior to the town hall meetings. As a result, pandemic influenza was likely not a new topic to them, but rather one to which they brought some previously held opinions. Participants were recruited from the general public in each location using social networking websites (e.g., Facebook) and local newspaper advertisements. Additionally, local study collaborators assisting in the organization of the town halls used snowball sampling to further recruit participants. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were over the age of 18, spoke fluent English, and had no relationship with the study investigators. In total, there were 63 participants across the three town halls: 18 in Vancouver, 25 in Winnipeg, and 20 in St. John. Participants were randomly assigned to separate focus groups on each topic: duty to care, use of restrictive measures, priority setting of scarce resources, and global governance. A total of 14 individuals attended and participated in the global governance focus groups: four in Vancouver, five in Winnipeg, and five in Saint John. No demographic information was solicited from the participants (e.g., ethnicity, income, etc.). However, based on self-reports during the initial round of introductions at the start of each focus group discussion, the participants were primarily middle-aged, ranging in age from their early 20s to late 80s, and divided equally among those who were currently employed and those who were retired or not employed. Several reported a history of community service work (e.g., as a community board member) or employment in the public sector. Several participants had a background in health care, but the majority did not. Participants were provided a travel voucher to cover travel costs incurred by attendance but were not paid for their participation.",

Findings from town hall meetings focusing on other ethical issues during a pandemic, including health care workers\u2019 duty to care (Bensimon et al. 2012), the use of restrictive measures (Smith et al. 2012), and priority setting of scarce resources (Silva et al. 2012), have been published elsewhere. At each town hall meeting, participants were randomly divided into groups of five to eight people and were asked to deliberate on the ethical issues associated with an assigned case scenario previously developed collaboratively by the research team (in this case, the scenario of \u201cglobal governance\u201d\u2014see Appendix 1). Data were then collected through day-long focus groups (lasting approximately eight hours) facilitated by a member of the CanPREP team using the case scenarios as the stimulus object or focusing component (Millward 2012). Focus group guides (see Appendix 1) were used by the facilitators with prompts that aimed to encourage deliberation on the ethical issues without altering the natural flow of conversation among participants. The scenario on global governance was designed such that it would introduce new information throughout the day (referred to by team members as \u201creveals\u201d\u2014see Appendix 1) in order to explore whether additional details would alter the opinions and arguments of participants. At the end of the day, all four focus groups reconvened to debrief and further discuss the key ethical issues that were raised in each of the separate focus groups. All focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and verified by research team members.",

As argued by Morgan (2010), participants \u201cown\u201d dialogue when they are \u201celectrified\u201d by a topic (in this case the initial scenario\u2014see Appendix 1) and subsequently proceed to \u201cextend, elaborate and embroider\u201d (Wilkinson 1998, 337). Thus, the role of the facilitator in each focus group was to maintain the focus with \u201cspecificity, range, and depth\u201d (Millward 2012, 427) in an unobtrusive and subtle way. Participants were encouraged to direct conversation toward each other, not the facilitator. The facilitators were knowledgeable about global health governance and able to provide factual information when needed but without attempting to unduly influence the conversation.",

In contrast to this, those who were empathetic were able to see that Indonesia, as a country of lesser means, had little recourse other than to leverage its biological capital to get what it needed.",

The desire to ensure that aid was effective was driven not by a moral imperative to address a pressing human need but to ensure that resources were not being squandered. While this is certainly a part of good stewardship, it precludes a discussion around the issue that other countries may have a moral claim on global health resources. In this way, then, it narrows the discourse to exclude a broader conversation of other ethical considerations. This mirrors health policy discourse around cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analyses (Powers and Faden 2008) and broader policy where ethical, social, and cultural issues are put into a \u201ctechno-bureaucratic box\u201d (Garoon and Duggan 2008) and subjugated to the dominant discourse of economics.",

The preservation of social order and functioning is a self-evident goal, despite the fact that preserving social order and functioning entails maintaining health inequities and patterns of disadvantage (Garoon and Duggan 2008). So much of our discourse around health is permeated with economic discourse, where efficiency has become a \u201ccult\u201d (Stein 2002), health disparities are viewed as natural rather than the result of economic power relations, and modern advances in health are driven by market forces rather than human need (Benatar, Gill, and Bakker 2009). This is not to say that economic concerns are not morally relevant, for indeed quite the opposite is true. However, orthodox economics has given rise to what Gill and Bakker (2011) call a \u201cmarket civilization\u201d that is individualistic, consumerist, and privatized, among other things. Despite the fact that there are many other ways to think about economic theory, self-interest has remained central to much of economic theory, despite empirical evidence that agents are not just activated by self-interest (Sen 1977). The resulting valorization of acting on self-interest over solidarity is reflected in these data. Indeed we saw this when one participant took it as self-evident that if Canada was the source of the outbreak, supplies would go to its citizens, and this was framed as being \u201cpractical.\u201d That this person deems it impractical to share resources during a pandemic of local origin demonstrates how acting in self-interest has become common sense, or the \u201crational\u201d response.",

While this framework was the result of both conceptual scholarship and a prolonged stakeholder vetting process with health care workers and many levels of government decision-makers, it did not include members of the public (Thompson et al. 2006). It is interesting to note, then, that these values seem to have resonance across lay and expert populations, and these findings speak to the robustness of earlier work on ethical issues in pandemic planning, going back to the SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003 (Singer et al. 2003).",

For example, the WHO\u2019s ethical guidance document on the control and care of tuberculosis includes the value of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d (World Health Organization 2010). While the latter is framed slightly differently than the cost-effectiveness discussed by participants, the underlying value of good stewardship over scarce resources is shared. Thus, it must be stated that the economic rationality is not value-free and therefore does not represent an extra-moral discourse. The problem lies in the narrowing of relevant concerns within the economic rationality, where the value of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d becomes limited to issues of \u201ccost-effectiveness,\u201d and concerns about how one determines what is most morally significant to \u201ceffectiveness\u201d (for example, does a treatment save lives?) become subjugated to issues of \u201cbang for the buck\u201d (are costs to the health care system lessened?). While sometimes what is a morally effective option is also the cost-effective option, too often this is not the case, and the preoccupation with cost-effectiveness directs our attention away from social inequalities in health (Powers and Faden 2000; Thompson 2013).",

When we speak of moral imagination, we refer to Jonathan Glover\u2019s (2000) notion that the moral imagination is the ability to put oneself in the shoes of another. While we would not argue that these town hall meetings were \u201cideal speech\u201d situations (Habermas 1970), we were encouraged that this kind of public engagement could elicit such a shift in the participants\u2019 moral sentiments. Shifts in attitudes and opinions are common in focus groups (Kitzinger 1994); however, the shift toward a more compassionate view of the Indonesian position was not a foregone conclusion. While some participants came into the day already able to imagine themselves in the shoes of others, others were able to eventually discern that there were humanitarian reasons for action. This happened when participants engaged emotionally with situations in a manner that negated self-interest and allowed them to demonstrate empathy, compassion, and solidarity. The willingness of some participants to frame the issues presented in the scenario as a matter of balancing distal and proximal obligations to others, instead of insisting on a stance that furthered domestic interests as a matter of \u201cpracticality,\u201d demonstrates this. This is the first step in shifting public discourse about global relations from one where nations continue to view themselves and the health of their citizens in isolation. Only in this way can we challenge the view that so many in these town hall meetings espoused early on in the day, that poverty is the result of bad government and has nothing to do with the power of wealthy nations. While corruption is part of the explanation, \u201cwealthy nations, and by association their citizens, are deeply implicated in the generation and maintenance of forces that perpetuate social injustice and poverty\u201d (Benatar 2005, 1209). While it would be overstating things to say that the participants came to this particular realization, we should not underestimate the importance of the participants\u2019 shift toward a sense of solidarity that was facilitated by participation in a deliberative process.",

The promise of this methodology to foster the development of moral imagination through the use of staged scenarios and group deliberation warrants further research. If we consider the development of our collective moral imagination as one of the grand challenges for global health, as Benatar (2005) urges us to do, it is possible that we have identified an important methodology for public engagement that has the potential to encourage people to frame issues of global health in moral rather than economic terms and through deliberation foster the values of empathy, solidarity, and reciprocity that are essential if we are to address global health inequities. For while we may be entering a new era of collaboration and cooperation in global health governance (Santos-Preciado et al. 2009), it will be not be sustainable if we cannot find ways of fostering the moral sentiments of compassion, solidarity, and \u201cmutual caring\u201d (Benatar, Daar, and Singer 2003) in our citizens.",
