Incidence of this disease in cancer patients would be more contributory to evaluation if we knew whether or not these patients indeed ran a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. For another type of coronavirus, this does not seem to be the case, with 9% (41/455) of coronavirusrelated pneumopathy in patients having had cancer, and 9.6% (101/1048) in patients not having had cancer [3] . That said, coronavirus-related pneumopathy presented a higher risk of mortality in patients having had cancer. However, the new 2019-nCoV coronavirus possesses different epidemiological and biological characteristics [4] , and its consequences cannot be extrapolated to those of other strains. Some Chinese authors [5] ascribe the increased risk not to the cancer itself, but rather to the patients' having been unable, due to the epidemic, to receive necessary medical treatment.",

Moreover, this sub-group includes no cancer of the digestive system characterized by different biological behaviors of tumors or being treated by different therapies; that is why, at this stage, extrapolation to our discipline remains problematic. I wish to finish by putting forth some general remarks on ''proposals'' that from my standpoint raise questions on how we are to envision the evolution of our health care system. In fact, the proposals seem to emanate from a servicecentered or structure-centered vision. Before suspending or postponing all oncological activity, organization-wide adaptation mobilizing the different territorial treatment resources (private/public care offer) should be comprehensively explored.",

It is a question of adaptation not of therapeutic strategies, but rather, let me repeat, of the organization of health care services. In my opinion, the COVID-19 pandemic must not lead to the proposal of non-validated therapeutic strategies or sequences. To be clear, the HSPC recommends prioritizing the treatment, according to classical recommendations and in hospital if necessary, of cancer patients in curative treatment. Based on a Chinese publication [8] (clinical case versus the 3 cancer patients having contracted severe COVID-19 and mentioned in the paper by Liang et al.) , colectomy for cancer patients can quite certainly take place in COVID+ patients.",

More often than not, surgeons and oncologists are at the end of their therapeutic programs and it is necessary to take into account not only the time elapsed between consultation and treatment implementation, but also the therapeutic programs in their entirety [9] (15 different times are reported in this work, which analyzes their effects of the lapses and intervals on oncological outcomes).",

That said, some cancer surgeries do not justify a place taken in intensive care units and can be performed in virtually all relevant private and public establishments. The structuring of a care pathway under the aegis of the ARES (regional health agency) would permit the preservation in their functioning of a limited number of establishments capable of contributing to the collective effort not by setting up beds for intensive care under possibly highly suboptimal conditions, but rather by assuring a ''vital minimum'' level of health service in view of complying with a recent ministerial directive: ''The deprogramming of all non-urgent chirurgical or medical activity, without prejudice or loss of opportunity for the patients'' (patient referral, or reference to an interim agreement authorizing entrance of operators external to health care structures).",

While we were unfortunately not able to avoid the COVID-19 health care crisis, we cannot allow ourselves a 2nd health care crisis, which could be lessened and alleviated by collective intelligence and the pooling of resources before withholding treatment offer in digestive oncology.
