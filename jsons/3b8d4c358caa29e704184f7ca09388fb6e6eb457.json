Members of the Coronaviridae express canonical polymerase genes, as well as structural genes, including S, E, M, and N, but also express a highly divergent set of accessory genes whose open reading frames are interspersed among the structural genes within the 3 0 one-third of the viral genome. The accessory genes are thought to contain \"luxury\" functions that are often not required for in-vitro virus replication. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) expresses eight such accessory genes (ORF3a, -3b, -6, -7a, -7b, -8a, -8b, and -9b), the most of any known coronavirus. This chapter will review our current knowledge of expression, structure, and function of each of the SARS-CoV accessory genes.",

Annotations by Thiel et al. were the least stringent and identified the eight currently accepted accessory genes; additionally, nomenclature consistent with other coronaviruses was given to them which will be used throughout this chapter. Numerous studies have reported on the expression of all eight SARS-CoV accessory genes. Few polymorphisms have been identified in the more than 100 sequenced SARS-CoV isolates, suggesting a selective pressure to maintain their expression. This chapter will review current data regarding the expression, structure, function, and molecular biology of the SARS-CoV accessory genes (Table 10 .1). ORF8ab is N-glycosylated.

ORF3a is O-glycosylated (Oostra et al. 2006) and localizes predominantly to the Golgi and plasma membrane (Tan et al. 2004c; Yu et al. 2004; Ito et al. 2005; Yuan et al. 2005a; Lu et al. 2006; von Brunn et al. 2007 ). Plasma membrane trafficking and endocytosis is mediated by a YxxF motif and a diacidic motif in the cytoplasmic tail that are juxtaposed to one another within a 14 amino acid region (Tan et al. 2004c ). This region of the cytoplasmic tail has also been shown to mediate G1 phase cell cycle arrest in HEK-293T cells transfected with ORF3a cDNA (Yuan et al. 2007) .

Antibodies specific to ORF3a have shown the surprising ability to neutralize virus infection in multiple ways. Because some ORF3a is trafficked to the cell surface, antibodies recognizing the aminoterminal extracellular domain initiate complement-mediated lysis in the presence of functional complement proteins (Zhong et al. 2006) . ORF3a N-terminus-specific antibodies are also capable of neutralizing infectious virus in microneutralization assays (Akerstrom et al. 2006) .

The authors propose a role for ORF3a in virus release; however, an ORF3a deletion virus is not defective in virus entry, replication, assembly, or budding (Yount et al. 2005) . Additional evidence for ORF3a involvement in the virus lifecycle stems from the observation that ORF3a directly binds the 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome, mediated by residues 125-200 of the cytoplasmic tail (Sharma et al. 2007 ). ORF3a is not required for virus replication in vitro or in a small animal model, as a recombinant SARS-CoV strain deleted of ORF3a replicates to wild-type levels in numerous cell lines and in BALB/c mice (Yount et al. 2005) . Like many other SARS-CoV viral proteins, transient expression of ORF3a has been shown to induce apoptosis in Vero cells (Law et al. 2005) . Expression of ORF3a in 293T cells can also augment NF-k B activity (Kanzawa et al. 2006; Narayanan et al. 2007 ) and expression in A549 cells upregulates the expression and secretion of fibrinogen (Tan et al. 2005) .",

The ORF3b protein is 154 amino acids in length and the translation initiation AUG codon lies 418 nucleotides downstream of the ORF3a AUG. No transcriptional regulatory sequence exists upstream of the ORF3b sequence and there are 11 AUG sequences between the ORF3a and ORF3b initiation codons which likely precludes leaky scanning as the mechanism of ORF3b translation. Although the ORF3b coding sequence lies in a translationally unfavorable context, the protein has been observed in virus-infected Vero cells (Chan et al. 2005) and antibodies recognizing ORF3b have also been found in patient convalescent sera (Guo et al. 2004; Chow et al. 2006) .",

ORF3b has been shown to be an interferon antagonist (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007 ). SARS-CoV has the ability to prevent interferon-b (IFN-b) production in infected cells (Spiegel et al. 2005) and ORF3b may be one of several viral proteins whose function is to prevent IFN-b induction.

In-vitro expression of ORF7a results in apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway, inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, blockage of cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase, activation of NF-kB, increased IL-8 promoter activity, and activation of p38 MAP kinase (Tan et al. 2004a (Tan et al. , 2007 Kanzawa et al. 2006; Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2006; Yuan et al. 2006b; Schaecher et al. 2007b) . These varied results all suggest a role for ORF7a in altering the host cellular environment. A recombinant SARS-CoV lacking gene 7 induces earlystage apoptosis and cell death similar to wild-type virus, but latter stages of the apoptotic cascade are altered as oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation is significantly reduced compared to cells infected with wild-type virus (Schaecher et al. 2007b ); however, gene 7 deletion viruses have no discernable defect in virus replication, pathogenesis, or lethality in wild-type or immunodeficient Syrian golden hamsters (Schaecher et al. 2007b; Schaecher et al. 2008b) or in Balb/c mice (Yount et al. 2005) .",

The ORF8a/8ab translation initiation codon lies proximal to the strong sgRNA8 TRS, and translation of full length ORF8ab results in a 122 amino acid protein with an N-terminus identical to that of ORF8a, and C-terminus identical to that of ORF8b.

The crystal structure of the protein reveals an intertwined symmetrical dimer whose b-sheets form a tent-like structure (Meier et al. 2006) . Mass spectroscopy analysis revealed a long fatty acid or fatty acid ester molecule present in the structure's hydrophobic tunnel; it has been speculated that the ORF9b protein may anchor to intracellular membranes by internalizing one or more lipidic tails from membrane lipids (Meier et al. 2006) . ORF9b localizes to the ER region of transfected cells, suggesting that the protein may interact with intracellular membranes although no transmembrane regions are predicted within ORF9b. Yeast-twohybrid experiments have suggested that ORF9b interacts with viral proteins nsp8, nsp14, and ORF7b, and provide further evidence of homotypic interactions (von Brunn et al. 2007 ); however, no functional analysis has been described to date regarding the role of ORF9b in the context of the virus replication cycle.",

Have they been acquired through horizontal transfer from host cellular genetic material or heterologous viruses? Have they been acquired through gene duplication and subsequent mutation within the virus's own genome? Evidence has been presented pointing to both possibilities. For example, the group 2 coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase (HE) genes have approximately 30% amino acid identity with the influenza C virus (ICV) HE-1 subunit of the HEF gene; it has been suggested that an early group 2 coronavirus captured HE from ICV during a mixed infection (Luytjes et al. 1988 ). For the latter theory, several of the SARS-CoV accessory genes may have originated from internal duplication, fusion, or shifting events (Inberg and Linial 2004) . ORF3a may have arisen through gene duplication and mutation of the M ORF (Inberg and Linial 2004; Masters 2006; Oostra et al. 2006) . Furthermore, ORF7b and ORF8a have some amino acid sequence similarity to ORF3a, suggesting that the larger ORF3a may have given rise to ORF7b and ORF8 (Inberg and Linial 2004) . Regardless of the origins of the SARS-CoV accessory genes, the severe disease caused by the virus highlights the need to study the functions of its eight accessory genes.",

It is striking that a virus lacking each of the accessory proteins, either individually or in combination, replicates efficiently in BALB/c mice. This finding may indicate that other animal models for the in-vivo analysis of accessory gene function are required. It is also possible that some or all of the accessory genes play a more important role during infection of humans, bats or other animal reservoirs of the virus. Identifying the functions of these accessory proteins may prove beneficial not only for further understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, but also for better understanding and preparedness for future viral infectious diseases.",
