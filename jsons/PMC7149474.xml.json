Intra-luminal fermentation of undigested lactose from milk feeds by the normal or pathogenic gut flora leads to the production of gas (raising intra-abdominal pressure) and subsequent intestinal intra-cellular acidosis due to decreased gut perfusion.1 The intra-luminal gas produced in the gut can be absorbed by the intestinal wall leading to the typical appearance on plain X-ray films of intra-mural air known as pneumatosis intestinalis (Fig. 1). Intra-vascular absorption of this gas can be seen on plain X-rays within portal venous vessels (Fig. 2). Pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas are pathognomonic of a diagnosis of NEC.\n",

Frequently, severely ill infants with NEC require inotropic support to maintain adequate perfusion pressures. The assessment of intra-vascular blood volume and blood loss is a real challenge. High infusion rates of 20 ml kg\u22121 h\u22121 together with boluses of 5% albumin may be required as replacement fluid to maintain adequate circulating volume. A good urine output (>2 ml kg\u22121 h\u22121) may reflect an adequate perfusion pressure and hence correlate with an increased survival from an episode of severe NEC. Blood loss needs to be replaced with blood, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and albumin. Coagulopathy as indicated by constant oozing at the surgical field requires platelets and FFP transfusion.",

At times, in our experience, the infant with the distended abdomen is peripherally shut down and the anaesthetist has to compromise on monitoring the infant and start the surgical procedure with peripheral lines only. Almost all infants are intubated and ventilated before operation at our institute. The patients presenting with NEC for surgery are usually very sick and poikilothermic. Accordingly, body temperature monitoring and active warming measures, including a warm theatre, a forced-air blanket, and warmed i.v. fluids, are essential. Addition of a heated humidifier within the breathing system also helps to reduce heat loss.",

Induction with a high dose of opioid (e.g. fentanyl 10 \u00b5g kg\u22121 body weight or an equivalent dose of remifentanil or sufentanil) helps to avoid postoperative catabolism and substrate mobilization caused by the systemic stress response. This is worthwhile as the surgical stress response lasts longer in preterm infants than in full-term babies and adults.13 Moreover if the neonates have been in the NICU for a long time before operation, then they might require higher doses of opioids intraoperatively due to opioid tolerance. Nitrous oxide is contraindicated as it worsens bowel distension. The use of volatile anaesthetic agents, although not contraindicated, may not be required as the neonates are usually receiving opioid and benzodiazepine infusions as part of their intensive care sedation regimen.",
