Anxiety can occur in specific situations (e.g. owners are about to leave the house) or be more global where the pet is constantly anxious (Landsberg et al. 2001). Furthermore, anxiety can be mild where the pet may exhibit some anxiety-related behaviours or overwhelming where the pet outright refuses to interact, explore and learn. The behaviours and physiological signs of anxiety (Table 2.1) are modulated largely by serotonin and noradrenalin (both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripherally).\n",

Fear is often adaptive, protecting the animal from harm. However, at times fear can become maladaptive; it may be overwhelming (panic attack), irrational (phobia) or out of context. Fear-related behaviours mostly originate in the amygdala and are modulated via the autonomic nerve system. The autonomic and somatic signs (Table 2.2) vary depending on the stimulus and its intensity; however, they can be grouped into defensive non-action (e.g. freezing, passiveness and hyper-attentiveness) or defensive action (e.g. flight or fight). The fear response is modulated primarily by noradrenalin both in the CNS and peripherally. In addition, the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a role in fear-related behaviours in the amygdala.\n",

However, cats typically have dusk and dawn activity patterns (crepuscular species) related to their food acquisition needs and the activity of prey. Older pets may become more active at night-time when the owner is sleeping (Landsberg and Denenberg 2009). Younger pets may also wake their owners at night; however, the problem is more common in senior animals, because of many health issues (e.g. renal, gastrointestinal and joint diseases) that may contribute. They may seek food or attention or need to eliminate. In addition, the pet may wake up and walk around the house, and the owner\u2019s reaction (trying to stop or comfort the pet) may actually reinforce this behaviour by giving food or attention. Common reasons for night-time waking include not only CDS but also conditions that cause pain, discomfort, confusion or unsettled sleep including arthritis, gastrointestinal disease, organ-related dysfunction and endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism and hypertension. Sensory decline (vision, hearing) may reduce the pet\u2019s awareness and ability to cope with darkness or its response to stimuli. Any disease process that might increase thirst or hunger or frequency or volume of urine or stool may also contribute to night waking. Changes in sleep-wake cycles are common CDS-presenting complaints (Landsberg et al. 2011, 2013).",

This is particularly true in the Tibetan terrier and dachshund breeds who may develop obvious signs when 6 years or older and can survive past 10 years of age. The pathophysiology of the disease is yet to be elucidated as it is unclear whether the mechanism of injury is a direct consequence of the pigment accumulation in cells or if it involves an abnormal mitochondrial function.

In dogs and cats, primary intracranial tumours are more common, while metastatic neoplasias (hemangiosarcoma, carcinomas or multicentric lymphoma) remain on the differential diagnosis list. Brain tumours are often classified according to the cell lineage they originate from (meninges, glial cells, choroid plexus cells, lymphocytes, ependymal cells, etc.) or based on the circumferential location of the tumour in relation to the brain (extra-axial, intra-axial or intraventricular). In both dogs and cats, the most common intracranial tumours are meningiomas and typically present as single extra-axial masses, while the most common intra-axial tumours are gliomas (astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, glioblastoma). Round cell tumours such as lymphoma or histiocytic sarcoma can present with an intra-axial, intraventricular or extra-axial localisation (Dickinson 2014). The mechanisms of injury to the brain are multiple and depend on the size, growth and location of the tumour: direct invasion of the brain tissue and loss of function, ischaemia, focal compression, oedema formation and increased intracranial pressure, alteration of the balance of neurotransmitters, but also biochemical and immunological derangements. The strong breed predisposition seen for some tumours as gliomas in some dog breeds such as boxers, bulldogs and Boston terriers suggests a genetic susceptibility in specific breeds (Truv\u00e9 et al. 2016).",

It is not uncommon to diagnose a sizeable mass in the light of relatively subtle signs, as the brain is able to compensate for substantial changes in pressure and volume before the compensation mechanisms are exhausted. Behavioural changes are common and do not infrequently precede the development of neurological deficits that will make a forebrain neurolocalisation more obvious. As an example, the most common clinical signs in a study of pituitary macroadenoma were mentation (depression, stupor) and behavioural changes (pacing, disorientation, circling, head pressing, aggression). Behavioural changes can also be the only clinical complaint. Masses affecting the limbic system, association areas (such as the frontal lobe and parieto-temporal junction) or the ascending reticular activating system are likely to produce behavioural changes with or without any obvious neurological deficits (Berns et al. 2015). The changes that can be seen include the development of fearful or aggressive behaviour or conversely the development of an attention-seeking behaviour in a previously fearful animal. Cats can be seen hiding more in unusual places or can be found stuck in a corner of a room. Head pressing or compulsively circling to one side only will raise the suspicion towards a significant intracranial lesion, with the former signs being suggestive of raised intracranial pressure. House soiling can also precede the development of more worrisome neurological signs and could be exacerbated by the presence of a concurrent endocrinopathy causing PU/PD (hyperadrenocorticism, central diabetes insipidus or acromegaly due to a secreting pituitary tumour). Raised intracranial pressure can also lead to clinical signs of pain including vocalisation, aggression, lethargy and head pressing behaviours (Madison et al. 2015).",

MRI is the modality of choice to assess the brain and will be superior to CT due to its better soft tissue resolution. The results of the MRI scan need to be interpreted in conjunction with the index of suspicion and additional tests. If the MRI scan is normal, then CSF is collected. Patients affected by CDS can have a normal brain MRI or evidence of brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement. However, MRI changes of brain atrophy are not pathognomonic and can be seen with some chronic metabolic (chronic hypoglycaemia, congenital PSS), inflammatory (eosinophilic meningoencephalitis), neurodegenerative (e.g. ceroid lipofuscinosis) or even infectious diseases (Neospora caninum infection). Consequently, MRI findings of brain atrophy are not diagnostic of CDS but are compatible with it (Ettinger and Feldman 2009).",
