For droplet radii in the range 100 nm < R < 60 \u00b5m, evaporation can be described in the stagnant-flow approximation and is diffusion limited. Analytical equations are presented for the droplet evaporation rate, the timedependent droplet size and the sedimentation time, including the significant effect of evaporation cooling. Evaporation makes the time for large droplets to sediment much longer and thus significantly increases the viral air load. Using recent estimates for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in sputum and droplet production rates while speaking, a single infected person that constantly speaks without a mouth cover produces a total air load of more than 10 4 virions. In a mid-size closed room, this leads to a viral inhalation frequency of at least 2.5 per minute. Low relative humidity, as encountered inside buildings in winter and in airliners, speeds evaporation and thus keeps initially larger droplets suspended in air.",

            "text": "In the context of airborne viral infection pathways, the sedimentation properties of liquid droplets that contain non-volatile solutes and are subject to gravitational force, evaporation and evaporation cooling, are crucial. Partial aspects of this problem have been treated in previous experimental and theoretical works (1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10) (11; 12) . For estimates of the infection risk from airborne virus-containing droplets, the relevant droplet radii are less than 50 \u00b5m, because only those droplets stay floating in air for sufficiently long time. Duguid studied droplet sizes produced by humans sneezing, coughing and speaking from a microscopic analysis of marks left on slides and found droplet radii between 1 and 500 \u00b5m (3) . In fact, 95% of all particles had radii below 50 \u00b5m, and most final droplet radii were around 5 \u00b5m. Later studies basically confirmed these results and showed that in addition many droplets are produced in the sub-micron range during coughing and speaking (13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18) . In one study a multimodal droplet size distribution was found and rationalized in terms of distinct physiological droplet production mechanisms (19) . It was shown that the number of droplets produced while speaking depends among other factors on the voice loudness (20) and that droplet production while exhaling is the product of complex fluid fragmentation processes (21) . Recently, a much more sensitive method, time-resolved laser-light scattering, showed that far more droplets are produced than could be detected previously (22; 23) , which demonstrates that the measured droplet radius distribution depends on the size sensitivity of the measurement technique used and also on the time droplets spend in air before measurement. In the present work, evaporation effects for droplets with radii in the range from nm to a few hundred \u00b5m are considered, which is the range potentially relevant for the airborne route of virus infection (24; 25; 26; 27) . The calculations include the interplay of all relevant physical effects: i) the maximal evaporation reaction rate at the droplet surface as a function of relative humidity, ii) concentration-boundary as well as flow-boundary layers, iii) droplet cooling due to the large evaporation enthalpy of water, and iv) the water vapor pressure reduction due to the presence of non-volatile solutes (including virions) in the droplet. Analytical expressions for the evaporation rate, the time-dependent droplet radius and the sedimentation time are derived in all relevant radius regimes and relative humidities and estimates for the viral air load from speaking are derived, from which the virion inhalation frequency in closed rooms including air exchange due to ventilation is calculated.",

As shown here, this approximation is accurate for droplet radii in the range 100 nm < R < 60 \u00b5m, where evaporation cooling is important and reduces the droplet surface temperature by about 9 Kelvin at a relative humidity (RH) of 0.5, which significantly slows down evaporation. For radii larger than 60 \u00b5m, the air flow around the droplet speeds the evaporation process and at the same time becomes non-Stokesian due to non-linear hydrodynamics effects, which is treated analytically by double-boundary-layer theory including concentration and flow boundary layers. For radii smaller than 100 nm, the evaporation at the droplet-air interface becomes reaction-rate limited. For these small droplets, the evaporation rate is not limited by the speed with which water molecules diffuse away from the droplet surface, but rather by the rate at which water evaporates from the liquid surface.",

As a comparison, on an inanimate surface these viruses stay infectious for days (24; 30). As a further complication, the relative humidity seems to have a significant influence on virus stability, it was shown for bacteriophages and influenza viruses that stability is minimal at intermediate humidities around RH = 0.5 and is increased both for lower and larger humidities (31; 32). Unfortunately, similar data is not yet available for SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Many factors determine the likelihood that a virus will spread from one person to another and that disease will result, but for other viruses it is known that inhaling as few as 5 virions can cause infection (33), so the above estimate of a virion inhalation rate of 1PA/K\" = 2.5 :5 , which is a conservative estimate, should be relevant for the assessment of the viral airborne infection risk.",

In Appendix J it is shown that this approximation is valid for radii below R = 100 \u00b5m, which coincides with the relevant radius range for airborne infections. Surface tension effects, which increase the water vapor pressure, are negligible for droplets with radii larger than R = 1 nm, as explained in Appendix L.

These calculations demonstrate in terms of analytical formulas that droplets in the entire range of radii below 4 0=1E = 49 for RH = 0.5, shrink significantly from evaporation before they fall to the ground and thus stay floating in air longer than their initial radius would suggest. This leads to an enhanced viral air load for droplets in the entire initial radius range 10 \u00b5m < R0 < 40 \u00b5m, which is exactly the radius range of droplets primarily produced by speaking (22) (23). A simple estimate of the viral inhalation frequency in a closed room suggests that 2.5 virions are inhaled per minute if one person is constantly speaking and not wearing a mask, typical air-exchange rates do not lower this number significantly. Thus speaking and presumably more so singing are shown to increase the risk of airborne viral infections substantially, which can be reduced efficiently by wearing a mouth cover (22) (23).

Inside the flow boundary layer viscous effects are relevant and laminar flow is obtained, outside the flow boundary layer viscous effects can be neglected and potential flow is realized. At about the same range of radii, the stagnant approximation becomes invalid, because convection speeds up the evaporation process. This effect can be described by a concentration boundary layer. The problem is thus a double-boundary-layer problem and involves a concentration and a flow boundary layer. Whether the concentration boundary layer or the flow boundary layer is smaller and thus more relevant, depends on the relative air humidity. It turns out that the evaporation in the presence of convection is diffusion limited. For humid air with a relative humidity RH > 0.59, the concentration boundary layer is evaporation-rate limiting and the time-dependent radius decrease is given by Eq. (G7). For drier air with a relative humidity RH < 0.59, the flow boundary layer is evaporation-rate limiting and the time dependent radius decrease is given by Eq. (H6) . The results for the humid and dry boundary layer scenarios thus look quite similar, but the physical mechanisms behind the evaporation process are very different. At high Reynolds numbers the friction experienced by a falling droplet is reduced due to a combination of boundary layer effects, boundary-layer separation effects and turbulence effects. In Appendix I it is shown that the Stokes expression for the friction force acting on a falling spherical droplet is accurate for radii below about 160 . ",

Equation (K17) is modified for solutes that perturb the water activity, but for most solutes non-ideal water solution effects can be neglected. To illustrate this: the saturation concentration of NaCl in water is approximately 6 M, which corresponds, for simplicity assuming equal volume of Na + cations, Clanions and water molecules, roughly to a volume fraction of \u03a6 W =12M/(55+12)M = 0.18, thus suggesting a water vapor pressure corresponding to a humidity of = 1 \u2212 \u03a6 W = 0.82, which is rather close to the experimental humidity created by a saturated NaCl solution of 0.75.
