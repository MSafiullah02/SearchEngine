IAVs are the major etiological agent causing epidemics in humans and have the potential to cause pandemics. It is well established that cell\u2010surface SA acts as the primary attachment receptor for IAV, following recognition by the viral HA. However, the process of virus entry into cells, resulting in productive replication in airway epithelial cells or uptake by airway M\u03a6 and DC, remains poorly defined. Specialized receptors expressed by M\u03a6 and DC, including those of the CLR family, have emerged as important receptors for attachment and uptake of a range of viruses. We and others [1, \u2013, 3, 4] have recently provided evidence that CLRs may also play a role in IAV infection of M\u03a6 and DC.",

Two viral glycoproteins\u2014the HA and the NA\u2014protrude from the surface of the virion [5] and are key determinants in attachment, entry, and infection of target cells. The HA exists as a trimer of three identical monomers formed by noncovalent association. Each monomer consists of a globular head and a stalk region anchored in the viral envelope by a short hydrophobic sequence. Within the globular head is the receptor\u2010binding site, a shallow pocket of highly conserved amino acids that interact with N\u2010acetylneuraminic acid (commonly referred to as SA), expressed on oligosaccharide side\u2010chains of cell\u2010surface glycoproteins and glycolipids [6, \u2013, 8]. Following attachment, virus is internalized via endocytosis, and HA undergoes conformational changes in the low pH of the endosomal compartment to expose the fusion peptide at the N\u2010terminus of the HA2 subunit [9, 10]. Fusion of viral and endosomal membranes allows delivery of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm before entry into the nucleus to initiate viral replication [11].",

The majority of antigenic sites is found on the globular head, as well the enzyme\u2010active site that contains a number of charged amino acid residues [12]. The enzymatic function of NA is to cleave SA residues from the cell surface, enabling newly synthesized virions to detach from infected cells. In addition, NA cleaves SA from the IAV glycoproteins, thereby preventing HA\u2010mediated self\u2010aggregation of virus. Hence, HA and NA have opposing functions, such that high NA activity could result in inadequate attachment of HA to cell\u2010surface SA, and conversely, excessive HA activity may limit release of newly formed virions from infected cells. A balance between the activities of the HA and NA is therefore critical in determining the efficiency of infection by different IAV [13, 14].",

HA serves as the major target for neutralizing antibodies, and glycans on the head of HA are likely to shield or modify antigenic sites [6]. Analysis of H1 sequences (1918\u2013 2010) indicate no glycans present on the top of the receptor\u2010binding domain from 1918 and 2009 pandemic IAV strains [25], whereas the majority of seasonal H1 IAV strains is characterized by the presence of three to five glycosylation sites [26, 27]. Since their appearance in the human population in 1968, H3N2 viruses also acquired additional glycans on the head of HA [23, 28, 29], and recent strains carry as many as eight to 10 potential glycosylation sites [27].

The mouse\u2010adapted PR8 (H1N1) strain is notable for its lack of glycosylation on the head of HA [39]. We recently reported that addition of glycans to the PR8 HA or removal of glycosylation sites from the HA of seasonal strain A/Brazil/11/78 (H1N1) modulated sensitivity to collectins and virulence in a mouse model [40]. Therefore, the amount of glycosylation added to HA to circumvent humoral immune responses may be limited by the increased sensitivity of glycosylated IAV to components of innate defense.",

M\u03a6 and DC from humans or mice are susceptible to IAV, yet the outcomes of infection are less clear. IAV infection of M\u03a6/DC has been associated with productive infection [42, \u2013, 44] but also with nonproductive infection, whereby genomic replication and synthesis of at least some viral proteins occur, yet the infectious cycle is blocked prior to virus release [2, 3, 45, \u2013, 47, 48, 49, 50]. These differences may reflect the heterogeneous nature of M\u03a6 and DC, particularly in the lung, as well as susceptibility of M\u03a6/DC to infection by the particular IAV strain(s) used.",

The conformation of the SA linkage on host cells is an important determinant of virus tropism, In fact, residues within or in the vicinity of the receptor\u2010binding pocket of the viral HA modulate which SA linkages are preferentially recognized [52, \u2013, 54]. In general, human IAV prefer SA linked in an \u03b1(2,6)\u2010Gal conformation, which is abundant in the human respiratory tract [52, 55, \u2013, 57, 58], whereas avian IAV strains show a preference for \u03b1(2,3)\u2010Gal, which is expressed throughout the avian gastrointestinal tract [59, \u2013, 61].

One study attempting to elucidate the nature of IAV receptors reported that a mutant CHO cell line deficient in N\u2010linked glycans (Lec1 cells) was largely resistant to IAV infection, despite retaining full capacity for virus binding [67]. This led the authors to propose that SA expressed on glycolipids alone were insufficient for infection of CHO cells and that N\u2010linked glycoprotein(s) were critical for infectious entry. Other studies have confirmed that binding of IAV to sialylated cell\u2010surface receptors does not always result in receptor\u2010mediated internalization [68, 69]. Rappoport et al. [70] examined binding of oligosaccharide probes to MDCK and Vero epithelial cell lines and obtained results consistent with the presence of cell\u2010surface galectins and/or mannose\u2010binding lectins, which they proposed could potentially recognize IAV and contribute to infection. Collectively, these findings imply that the presence of cell\u2010surface SA is not always sufficient for IAV infection. Moreover, attachment and entry of IAV into cells can occur independently of SA. As proposed by Stray et al. [66], SA may enhance binding to the cell surface to increase subsequent and/or simultaneous interaction with secondary and/or coreceptors that are required for virus entry.",

First, CRDs of the MMR have been shown to recognize N\u2010linked glycans on the HA/NA of IAV in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner [2]. In addition, IAV infection of primary mouse M\u03a6 but not epithelial cells was inhibited by mannan, a complex polymer of mannose residues [2, 3], and susceptibility of the J774 M\u03a6 cell line to IAV infection correlated with levels of MMR expression [2]. Recently, we used direct\u2010binding techniques to further characterize interactions between MMR and IAV. SA\u2010dependent binding of IAV HA to MMR was reported, as well as SA\u2010independent recognition of glycans on viral HA/NA by the lectin activity of MMR [3]. However, sialidase treatment of M\u03a6 greatly reduced susceptibility to IAV infection, demonstrating that efficient infection requires contributions from SA and the lectin activity of MMR.",

Although MGL is sialylated, binding of MGL to IAV was blocked completely in the presence of galactose, indicating that SA expressed by MGL was not recognized by HA (or at least not by the HA of IAV strains used in the study). Moreover, IAV infection of M\u03a6 was blocked by addition of asialofetuin, a multivalent ligand of MGL. These studies were not designed to discriminate between binding to MGL\u20101 or MGL\u20102; however, the M\u03a6 cell lines used expressed only MGL\u20101, pointing to a role for this receptor in IAV infection of murine M\u03a6.

For many viruses, identification of cell\u2010surface receptors has been demonstrated following transfection of gene(s) encoding putative receptor(s) into cell lines that are resistant to infection, such that cells are rendered susceptible to virus entry. When studying IAV, such approaches are complicated by the abundant cell\u2010surface SA on mammalian cells, and it has been difficult to find cell lines that are resistant to infection. Recently, we demonstrated that Lec2 cells, a mutant CHO cell line deficient in cell\u2010surface SA [129, 130], bound IAV poorly and were largely resistant to IAV infection [1]. These studies defined an experimental system, in which SA\u2010independent interactions between IAV and putative cell\u2010surface receptors could be investigated. Expression of DC\u2010SIGN (or its homologue L\u2010SIGN) by SA\u2010deficient Lec2 cells resulted in Ca2+\u2010dependent IAV attachment and enhanced susceptibility to infection [1]. As infection was blocked by mannan, but not by pretreatment with bacterial sialidases, we concluded that DC\u2010SIGN mediated recognition of mannose\u2010rich glycans on IAV to promote SA\u2010independent IAV infection. Wang et al. [4] also used a transfection\u2010based approach to report that DC\u2010SIGN can act as a receptor for H5N1 IAV. In this model, DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated H5N1 infection of transfected cells was dependent on the presence of cell\u2010surface SA (for infection in cis), and captured virus particles were also transferred to other permissive cells (for infection in trans).",

Poorly glycosylated IAV, such as PR8, did not bind CLRs efficiently and were poor in their ability to infect CLR+ cells [1, 3]. The contribution of specific glycans on the head of H1 [40] and H3 [38] IAV in determining sensitivity to soluble C\u2010type lectins has been defined recently, and similar approaches will yield important information as to which glycans on different IAV subtypes are recognized by membrane\u2010associated CLRs.",

For many viruses, it is unclear whether enhanced infection results from CLR\u2010mediated endocytosis or following subsequent interaction with other entry receptors (Table 1). WT and endocytosis\u2010defective DC\u2010SIGN permitted dengue virus infection of transfected cells, indicating that endocytosis via DC\u2010SIGN itself was not essential for infection [140]. Similar approaches will be used to determine whether CLRs can act as direct entry receptors for IAV. As well as promoting infection in cis, CLRs on M\u03a6/DC can capture and sequester virus, which may then be passed to other permissive cells. In this way, DC\u2010SIGN promotes in trans infection by H5N1 IAV [4], HIV\u20101 [142], HCV [146], CMV [149], and Ebola viruses [127].

For IAV, it seems likely that multiple low\u2010affinity interactions between the viral HA and SA concentrate virus at the cell surface, allowing it to \u201cbrowse\u201d or \u201croam\u201d the cell surface until it contacts secondary receptor(s), as posited by Burnet [152]. On M\u03a6 and DC, lectin\u2010mediated binding by CLRs may represent one pathway by which IAV entry and infection can occur. However, at present, it is not clear whether CLRs themselves act as endocytic receptors for IAV or if additional receptors and/or coreceptors are required for virus entry. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which M\u03a6 and DC recognize and internalize IAV may provide important information relevant to the tropism of different IAV for particular airway cells and therefore, pathogenesis. For example, mouse\u2010adapted IAVs, such as PR8, evade detection by CLR [2, 3], infect airway M\u03a6 poorly [1, 2, 153], and induce severe disease in mice following intranasal infection [154]. Moreover, in mice \u03b1(2,6)\u2010Gal SA is the predominant linkage of M\u03a6 compared with \u03b1(2,3)\u2010Gal SA on epithelial cells [64, 155, 156], suggesting that the particular linkage of SA may be an important factor in recruiting particular IAV to different airway cells.",
