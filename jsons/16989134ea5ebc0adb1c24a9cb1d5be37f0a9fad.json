Current research suggests that efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected individuals (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) to uninfected contacts can result from respiratory droplets, aerosols, and direct contact. Other routes, including the fecaloral and mother-to-child vertical transmission, have not been confirmed. The main clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection (known as COVID-19) are fever, fatigue, and cough leading to pneumonia that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome [2, 3] . There are currently several documented cases of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 that had digestive findings as the first sign of disease [4] . We present a case of COVID-19 that presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of hematochezia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 174, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 684, "end": 687, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 688, "end": 690, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 831, "end": 834, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "An 83-year-old man presented with chief complaint of dark-red bloody stools.
