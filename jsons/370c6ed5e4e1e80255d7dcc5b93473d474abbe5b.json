There is no proven vaccine or specific drug to date, which highlights the urgent need for rapid development of therapeutics for COVID-19. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression perturbation data by chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project with publically available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We identified 281 FDA approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. In conclusion, we have identified a list of repurposable anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs using a systems biology approach.",

Considering that an RNA virus exhibits a considerable degree of sequence variation, drugs targeting host factors may cause less mutational resistance with more effective and broad anti-virus spectrum potential.

Data mining was performed by using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) [21] , a drug perturbation database, to identify potential therapies for COVID-19 disease. A total of 281 candidates of different courses of COVID-19 independent of cell subtypes were identified, 10 of which were in clinical trials of COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir [22] , dexamethasone, niclosamide, lenalidomide, hydrocortisone, metformin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, and verapamil. Subsequently, we utilized the side effect prediction based on L1000 (SEP-L1000) project to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and constructed drug-ADR association [23, 24] .",
