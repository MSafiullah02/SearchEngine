The framework also allows for reliable projections on the impact of travel limitations and social distancing measures on global epidemic spread. We test and calibrate it on reported cases while unveiling the mechanism that governs the delay in the relative peaks of newly infected cases among different regions of the globe. We discover that social distancing measures are more effective than travel limitations across borders in delaying the epidemic peak. We further provide the link to compartmental models such as the simplistic and time-honoured SIR-like models. We also show how to generalise the framework to account for the interactions across several regions of the world, replacing or complementing large scale simulations.",

Using a powerful language and methodology borrowed from high energy physics, we study and forecast the spreading dynamics and containment across different regions of the world. This framework is the renormalisation group approach [1, 2] , which was successfully employed for epidemic dynamics in [3] . Here we will generalise the framework to take into account the dynamics in between different regions of the world. The approach is complementary to other methods summarised in [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . As for the widely adopted choice to represent the data by fitting them to simple minded logistic functions we refer to [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . We will also provide a map between our framework and compartmental models such as the time-honoured SIR model [15] .

The derivative of \u03b1 with respect to time provides a new quantity that we interpret as the betafunction of an underlying microscopic model. In statistical and high energy physics, the latter governs the time (inverse energy) dependence of the interaction strength among fundamental particles. Here it regulates infectious interactions. More specifically, as the renormalisation group equations in high energy physics are expressed in terms of derivatives with respect to the energy \u00b5, it is natural to identify the time as t/t 0 = \u2212 ln \u00b5/\u00b5 0 , where t 0 and \u00b5 0 are respectively a reference time and energy scale. We choose t 0 to be one week so that time is measured in weeks, and will drop it in the following. Thus, the dictionary between the eRG equation for the epidemic strength \u03b1 and the high-energy physics analog is It has been shown in [3] that \u03b1 captures the essential information about the infected population within a sufficiently isolated region of the world.

The latter value encodes the total number of infected cases per million expected in the region under study. The coefficient \u03b3 is the diffusion slope, while b shifts the entire epidemic curve by a given amount of time. Further details, including what parameter influences the flattening of the curve and location of the inflection point and its properties can be found in [3] . Note that here we work with number of cases per million, so that our \u03b1 corresponds to \u03b1 \u2212 ln n m of [3] with n m the number of inhabitants per million per each sufficiently isolated region of the world. In this work, we extend the eRG formalism to include the diffusion of the epidemic between multiple nearly-isolated regions. Our work is organised as follows. In Sec. II we present the formalism in the simple case of two regions, and study how the interaction term influences the delay between the epidemic peak between the first and second regions. We also investigate the effect of closing the borders at different times between the two regions. In Sec. III we map the eRG formalism onto time-honoured compartmental models of the SIR-type. In Sec. IV we test the eRG formalism by comparing the predictions to data relative to the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe and in the United States, and generalise it to include multiple regions at the same time. We then use the model to simulate a second wave of epidemic diffusion in a sample of European countries. Finally, we present a discussion of the results in Sec. V and offer our conclusions.",

(3), with its own \u03b3 i and a i . We exemplify the framework by first considering two regions, and we generalise to multiple ones later. To couple the two equations, we start from the following axiom: there is a constant number of travellers moving from one region to the other, and viceversa, given by \u2206N trav each week. Our basic simplifying assumption is that the number of travellers is symmetric, i.e. there is no net flow of people between the two regions: this is a reasonable approximation during a short time as immigration only involves a smaller fraction of inhabitants than that involved in the epidemic. We further use the approximation that the rate of infected cases within the travelling subset of people is the same as the rate of infected cases in the total population of each region. Thus, the variation in the number of infected cases per million in region-1 is given by 1",

The fact that the \u03b1's become equal in the long run indicates that the two regions have merged into one. One surprising finding is that the total number of infected cases across the two regions, for large k, may be reduced compared to the isolated case (see details in Appendix A). While mathematically intriguing, we do not consider this result physical, as having large k modifies the values of \u03b1 i and \u03b3 i in the two regions compared to the values one would have in case of isolation.

(11), except that we set b 2 = \u221e, i.e. the region-2 remains with zero infected cases if isolated. One caveat that should be kept in mind is that the values for \u03b3 in Table I are obtained by fitting the data during the whole period of the epidemic, i.e. they take into account the effect of social distancing measures in each region. However, at the early stages of the epidemic, when social distancing measures were not yet being enforced, we expect larger values of \u03b3. That is the reason why, in the following, we assume \u03b3 = 1 as the natural initial benchmark value. Nevertheless, we show how different social distancing measures impact the results for region-2 by showing also the results for smaller values of \u03b3 2 . We discover that the interaction among the two regions of the world, controlled by the parameter k, is sufficient to ignite the spread of the epidemic to region-2 and it also controls the timing of the peak. This is shown in Fig. 2 , where we plot the time of the peaks in the two regions as a function of k/n m2 . The result does not depend on n m1 . Also, the time of the peak for region-1 is unaffected by the value of k (dashed curve) while it affects the timing of the peak for region-2 (solid curves). Note that the kterm in Eq. (10) sparks the epidemic diffusion in region-2 as soon as k nm2 e \u03b11(t) becomes sizeable.

The former is due to an interaction between two different regions of the world, while the latter is a constant of integration that depends on the number of cases at the initial time t = 0 in region-2. This also means that a specific peak time for region-2 relative to region-1 can emerge as a combination of the two effects, interpolating between the two limiting cases: the peak delay is entirely due to the interaction with region-1, or it is due to the presence of cases in region-2 (which may have different origin) and the coupling to region-1 is negligible.

Thus, our eRG approach would be equivalent to the SIR model if we could drop the R(t) dependence in the differential equation for I(t). It is conceivable that this is the case: in fact, in Eq.
