However, in many cases of diagnosed CAP based in clinical and radiologic findings, the etiology cannot be defined.3,12 Human rhinovirus, Influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most commonly detected pathogens.1,3 The indirect protection of adults as a result of pediatric and adult pneumococcal vaccination may potentially contribute to a slow decrease in the incidence of pneumococcal infection, but for the time being data is missing in our country.1,3,21\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are also common and are often referred to as \u201catypical\u201d agents.12 Agents such as S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus are overrepresented among severely ill patients as well as patients with associated comorbidity, prior influenza infection or antimicrobial treatment.1,3 Among patients who require admission to an ICU, S. pneumoniae is the most commonly detected pathogen.1 Also, S. pneumoniae is the most frequently causative microorganism in smokers, particularly in invasive pneumococcal disease and septic shock.22 Patients who are severely ill with influenza pneumonia should be evaluated for secondary bacterial infection, which is most likely to be caused by S. pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus and S. aureus (including community methicillin-resistant (MRSA)). C. psittaci should be considered in the case of exposure to birds. In patients who present certain comorbidities or some risk for HCAP, MRSA and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli should be considered. MRSA is an important cause of severe, occasionally necrotizing CAP. Pneumocystis jirovecii is a possible agent in patients with immunodepression such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, autoimmune diseases, transplanted or under immunosuppressive drugs. Fungal infection is an unusual cause of CAP in the immunocompetent patient, but certain fungi (e.g. Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides spp.) can cause pneumonia in patients who live in or have visited endemic areas. Due to globalization, etiology of pneumonia nowadays is a dynamic issue, as evidenced by the emergence of avian influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).1",

The first two scores are admission scoring systems and the last one is a repetitive scoring system. The APACHE score is probably the best-known and the most widely used score. Scoring systems essentially consist of two parts: the severity score (the higher the number, the greater the severity of the condition) and the calculation of mortality risk.25",

Patients classified as high grade APACHE II and PSI scores had significantly higher mortality rates and smaller median survival times. Other scores did not show significant differences between high grade and low grade patients even though they followed the same tendency. The lack of ability to predict mortality by SAPS II and SOFA scores in contemporary ICU cohorts may reflect their need for re-calibration. Missing values for some variables, the use of the worst recorded parameters over a 24h period regardless of treatment and inclusion of the Glasgow Coma Scale when assessing sedated and mechanically ventilated patients may justify the inaccuracy of these models. Also, the SOFA score was not designed for mortality prediction but to evaluate organ dysfunction and morbidity.33 On the other hand, the fact that just the APACHE II and the PSI system scores showed statistical differences highlights the hypothesis that mortality prediction may be related to prior health conditions. Apart from these two score systems, only the SAPS II takes prior health conditions into consideration and, although its results were not statistically significant, it was the third more accurate system predicting mortality. Global mortality rate in this sample was 26.87%, approximately 1.5 times higher than the mortality risk estimated by APACHE II (41.38%) and PSI (39.39%) scores for high score patients. In reality, severity index systems are not 100% accurate. They generally consider a variety of parameters that vary among different score systems and pretend to predict the likelihood of in-hospital mortality and to be a guide to decide the initial phase of treatment.25,31 However, they do not take into account important parameters such as social factors or performance status. Also, the selection of the median score to group patients into low grade or high grade scores can have influenced these results. Besides helping to predict risk of in-hospital mortality, the ICU scores could also predict severity and the need for organ support such as cardiovascular and respiratory support. SMART-COP is another simple, practical clinical score that allows the identification of patients with severe pneumonia who require ICU care for eventual invasive ventilation and vasopressor support.30 In this study, several clinical and analytical parameters were related to greater mortality and the need for organ support, but most of them were already considered by previous scores except CRP and albumin levels. The importance of identifying sepsis early and to initiate prompt measures to minimize complications is unanimous. The SIRS criteria is too sensitive but not sufficiently specific for this purpose. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis recommended qSOFA as a quicker and more specific way to identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to be septic and at a greater risk of death or prolonged intensive care unit stay.20 Although qSOFA is less accurate than the original SOFA score, it does not require laboratory tests and it is simpler to assess.21",

It would be relevant to access comorbid conditions in a future study by quantifying the grade of disease and perform a multivariate analysis to better understand comorbidities' cumulative behavior. Another limitation of this study was the inability to determine symptoms' duration until treatment. Current more aggressive treatment options and precocity of adequate treatment may contribute to lesser mortality even in the presence of comorbidities.25,31 On the other hand, a prolonged ICU admission time in obese patients and smokers was found, as previously reported for obesity, besides an apparent paradoxical link between obesity and improved survival.28 According to previous studies, the length of patients' stay in hospital seems to be influenced by several variables such as the PSI score, associated comorbidities and the presence of clinical complications.7 Smoking is an extensive studied comorbidity, known for the worst prognosis, including higher mortality rates.16 In this cohort, smokers needed more vasopressor support and IMV than other patients and, although requiring a longer stay in hospital, they had a higher median survival time. It would make sense to do a study on the connection between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the length of the smoking habit. These two comorbidities are potentially modifiable conditions leading to the importance of patient information and promotion of healthy habits. DM was associated with a greater need for RRT, probably due to the worsening of pre-existing clinical or subclinical kidney and/or cardiovascular diseases.27 Although higher mortality seen in patients with CKD did not reach statistical significance (p=0.2161), patients with chronic kidney disease showed lower median survival time during their time at hospital and, similarly to what happens with diabetic patients, this may reflect a greater susceptibility to develop an acute kidney failure.25,27 Acute renal impairment had an important interference in patient evolution in this study as already proposed by previous studies.25 Active malignant neoplasia was also associated with lower median survival time. Although considered a risk factor for CAP,1 immunosuppression in general had no impact on prognosis. Once again, it would be relevant to develop a multivariate study to understand how co-morbid conditions influence treatment decisions.",
