This patient was admitted to the emergency ward with fever, cough, dyspnea and weight loss. Chest CT scan showed diffuse and bilateral ground glass opacities. P. jirovecii (PJP) was identified by immunofluorescence (IF), performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and other virus, bacterial and fungal infections were excluded with appropriate microscopic, cultural or molecular methods on BAL. Galactomannan test was performed on BAL and blood samples. Two days after the beginning of treatment with steroids and cotrimoxazole, the patient developed mild ARDS [4] that was initially treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Later, ARDS evolved to the severe stage [4] and a significant pneumo-mediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema occurred. For this reason, eight days after the onset of respiratory failure, the patient was referred to the regional ECMO center.",

This setting allowed a super-protective ventilatory strategy that consisted in a tidal volume of 5 ml/kg and a respiratory rate of 5 breaths/min (Table 2). This strategy offered the advantage to rest the lung minimizing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury [5]. At the third day of ECMO, the patient was successfully extubated and ventilated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) by facemask. Details of HAART, antibiotic and antifungal treatments are shown in Table 1. After 20 days, ECMO was stopped when arterial blood gases were satisfactory for at least eight hours with a blood flow of 1.5 L/min and a sweep gas of 0.5 L/min (Table 3).

For immunocompromised patients, the guidelines do not propose absolute contraindications but suggest to consider the individual risks/benefits balance. Only leukopenia with absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3 and recent or expanding central nervous system hemorrhages are considered relative contraindications. In patients with HIV infection, ECMO may erroneously be considered futile because of the patient\u2019s prognosis and of the uncertainties regarding the efficacy of HAART. Our reports show that ECMO is not futile when clinicians consider the immune-virological parameters with the full potential of HAART success.",

Moreover, the individual level of compliance has been showed to be highly variable over a long history of HAART [10]. In our case, although a complex 6-drug based HAART was started, an adequate counseling after the discharge from ICU along with rapid clinical improvement reinforced patient\u2019s adherence, with treatment efficacy at 48-week.",
