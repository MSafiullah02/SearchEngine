There are four major serotypes of HPIV, noted as serotypes 1 to 4 with human HPIV4 subdivided into two genera (HPIV4a and HPIV4b).11 HPIV1 and HPIV3 are members of the genus Respirovirus and the genus Rubulavirus includes HPIV2 and HPIV4. Parainfluenza virions are pleomorphic, ranging in diameter from 150 to 200 \u00b5m (Fig. 1).12\n13 They contain a single, negative-sense RNA strand which encodes six essential proteins in a conserved order: the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the phosphoprotien (P), the matrix protein (M), the fusion glycoprotein (F), the hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein, and the RNA polymerase (L).",

The matrix protein coats the inner surface of the envelope. The NP protein binds and coats the viral RNA, creating a template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, consisting of the P and L proteins, to facilitate transcription. The P gene also encodes additional proteins which vary among the four serotypes and are not essential for virus replication.17 HPIV1 and HPIV3 RNAs encode short C proteins and HPIV2 RNA encodes a V protein both of which suppress the host immune response by decreasing type 1 interferon activity. A third nonessential protein, D protein, is expressed by HPIV3, though the relevance and function of this protein remains unclear. Replication occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell and once produced the negative-sense RNA strands are packaged and exported as new virions.",

The impeded airflow produces the high pitched inspiratory vibrations known as stridor and increased work of breathing due to this obstruction may lead to fatigue and hypoxia and eventually respiratory failure in severe cases. Adult illness is generally mild, although airway hyper responsiveness may occur in persons with asthma due to release of cytokines and chemokines.28\n",

In contrast, the epidemiology of the HPIV4 infections has not been well studied with only few reports of small number viruses isolated from children and adults.41\n42\n43 This is due to the fact that illness related to HPIV4 infection is often mild and subclinical and the virus more difficult to detect.41\n43\n44\n45\n",

As airway obstruction progresses, chest wall retractions are generally accompanied by worsening agitation and increased inspiratory effort which paradoxically exacerbates the obstructive process. Hypoxia, cyanosis, and respiratory fatigue may develop, requiring intubation which can rarely be fatal (<0.5% of intubated patients).89 The diagnosis of croup is made clinically and severity measured by five clinical factors known as the Westley scale: mental status, the presence of absence of pallor or cyanosis, the presence of absence of inspiratory stridor at rest, the degree of chest wall retractions, and the amount of air entry (Table 1).90 Mild croup is characterized by the absence of stridor at rest and can often be managed symptomatically at home. In contrast, children with moderate to severe croup will present with inspiratory stridor at rest accompanied by variable degrees of respiratory compromise and should be evaluated in an acute care setting. Symptoms of croup typically resolve in 1 to 3 days with appropriate therapy (see section \u201cTreatment\u201d) but may persist for up to 7 days. Worsening symptoms after a period of improvement should prompt evaluation for bacterial complications.91\n",

Of those with URTI symptoms initially, 61% of leukemic patients and 39% of HSCT subjects progressed to pneumonia during their illness.112 In children, similar rates of progression to LRTI disease have been reported with one retrospective study finding that 47% of all viral infections in 274 pediatric HSCT recipients were caused by HPIV viruses and of those, 41% had pneumonia.113 Similarly, risk for severe disease is also increased in children undergoing chemotherapy, with the highest risk noted in children younger than 2 years with hematologic malignancies.114 Other factors associated with progression to lower respiratory tract disease include dose-dependent treatment with steroids, allogenic SCT (vs. autologous), time from transplantation (majority of cases in HSCT patients occur in <100 days posttransplantation), presence of lymphopenia, and pediatric age group.7\n78\n114\n",

The sample type will in part depend on the age and immune status of the patient and the severity and stage of the illness. Nasal washes which are commonly used in children are poorly tolerated by acutely ill older adults and NTSs are reasonable alternate specimens to collect.103 If swabs are to be collected, it is recommended that flocked swabs be used in preference to cotton swabs due to enhanced yield.136 The timing of sample collection during illness may also be important with upper airway samples being positive early in illness, whereas, later in illness, it may be more important to test lower airway secretions such as sputum and BAL fluid.

Traditional viral culture demands an experienced clinical laboratory, and time to diagnosis limits clinical utility (5\u201314 days).138 In an attempt to simplify the process, several commercially available mixed cell lines such as \u201cR-Mix\u201d have been used to successfully grow a variety of respiratory viruses including HPIV.139 To accelerate the time to identification, the shell vial culture system utilizes low speed centrifugation of the inoculum on monolayers with Mab staining at 24 hours and expedites the time to diagnosis.140\n",

Low viral loads can also be detected with PCR assays which may be important for early therapy and infection control in transplant populations.146 Several sample types can be used for PCR testing including NPS, NTS, nasal washes, and BAL fluid.

In children with SCIDS and HPIV infection, aerosolized ribavirin has been administered over long periods of time (3\u201310 months) without apparent toxicity.164 Consensus indicates that ribavirin is not effective for HPIV pneumonia when given late in the course of illness, especially if respiratory failure has ensued.7\n9\n174 Wendt and colleagues reported HPIV infection in 12 adults and 15 children undergoing HSCT with survival rates of 78% in those who received ribavirin as well as those who were not treated.9 However, treatment was started after 11 days of illness on average. Nichols et al reported the treatment and outcomes of 253 HSCT patients with HPIV infection who were administered ribavirin within 48 hours of diagnosis and found no effect on 30-day mortality and the highest risk of death in patients with bacterial and fungal copathogens.78\n174 Finally, the largest series to date consisting of 544 HSCT recipients with HPIV infection treated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center demonstrated that the use of inhaled ribavirin was significantly associated with reduced overall mortality but not mortality specifically from respiratory failure in multivariable analysis.159 Moreover, in the subset with proven HPIV LRTI, there was no difference in mortality with ribavirin use.",

Cross protection between different HPIV serotypes is minimal or short lived, necessitating multiple or multivalent HPIV vaccines. Currently, most vaccine efforts are focused on HPIV3 which is the primary cause of severe disease and pneumonia in infants and in older adults. In young children, maternal antibody and the immature immune system are impediments to active immunization.194 However, HPIV1- and HPIV2-associated croup infections occur at an older age and therefore the timing of vaccination could be delayed. Because of the disastrous results of the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine trials performed in the 1960s during which enhanced disease with natural infection was observed, most HPIV vaccine research has avoided subunit vaccines.195 Several approaches have included cold passaged attenuated live HPIV vaccines, bovine HPIV, and recombinant bovine/human HPIV vaccines.194\n196\n197 As RSV and HPIV3 affect the same age group, recombinant vaccines that express both RSV and HPIV proteins are being explored.196\n197\n198\n199 Several candidate vaccines are now in phaseI/II clinical trials in children.",

Interestingly, two HPIV outbreaks occurred in healthy young adults 10 and 29 weeks after complete social isolation at the South Pole and were likely due to persistent low level shedding in some individuals.202 Outbreaks of HPIV after HSCT have been reported in inpatient and outpatient settings and, despite aggressive infection control measures, have been difficult to control.203\n204 In several instances, outbreaks appeared to be centered in the outpatient facilities where waiting rooms were sometimes crowded and common infusion areas were utilized.205 Because HPIV may cause prolonged asymptomatic infection, symptom-based infection control strategies which have been successful in curtailing RSV and influenza outbreaks may be less effective to prevent nosocomial spread of HPIV.206 When HPIV outbreaks are detected in settings where immunocompromised patients are cared for, enhanced infection control measures are recommended including strict visitor and patient-to-patient contact limitation, cohorting, masking of personnel and visitors in contact with HPIV-infected patients, and frequent cleaning of environmental surfaces.205 Screening of asymptomatic patients and staff may be indicated in difficult-to-control outbreaks.206\n",

The NP protein binds the viral RNA, creating a template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, consisting of the P and L proteins. Once replication is completed, HN and F proteins are transferred to the host cell membrane which forms the envelope for new virons which is coated on the inner surface by the matrix protein. The HN protein then facilitates budding and release of new virions from the cell by cleaving the sialic acid residues. (Reproduced with permission from Moscona A.
