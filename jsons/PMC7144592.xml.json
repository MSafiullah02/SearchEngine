Not a month has passed since the first positive Covid-19 case was detected in Spain and 39,673 cases have been confirmed, although the real number of cases is undoubtedly higher. The number of total deaths is now 2,696. An editorial in this journal alerted a few weeks ago about the importance of appropriate protection of health care professionals from exposure to critically infected patients (Jansson et al., 2020). However, in Spain alone, a total of 5,400 health care professionals have been infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

In Spain, despite information from other countries such as China, South Korea and Italy, why were messages of calm issued by the authorities until just a few days ago? Why were projections and modelling of the number of cases and deaths in the coming weeks not taken into account? Instead, similarity judgements were made: this is a flu-like virus, so it can be managed like flu. Perhaps when everything is over, we may be able to respond to these questions better.",

All those irrationalities and errors that we observe and will further see in the coming days derive from the inner workings of the human mind.

Spain has been ineffective in analysing the evidence generated from the experiences of countries ahead of us in the contagion curve and has been led by biases. Any process that involves different and even discordant voices will improve the decision-making process, while we should also avoid the Dunning-Kruger effect, i.e., overestimating knowledge about a topic when a little is known about a topic, exemplified by supposed experts making blunt statements of the type \u201cwhat we absolutely must do is this or that \u2026\u201d. We need to leave aside statements of this kind and be guided as much as possible by the existing evidence as expressed in formal protocols, guidelines or recommendations, always based on the highest quality scientific evidence. High-quality evidence tends to minimise methodological biases. Minimal bias in decision making at this time can be favoured by making use of different strategies at the level of healthcare experts (Table 1\n) (Dobler et al., 2019).",

A care overload will inevitably be associated with an increase in errors linked to care (Oliveira et al., 2016, Novaretti et al., 2014, Aiken et al., 2014), while patient care by non-experts in the area will undoubtedly be associated with poorer health outcomes (Faisy et al., 2016). An increase in anxiety and psychological disorders will undoubtedly be observed among professionals, due to the stresses of their care role as well as personal repercussions deriving from biological exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the probability of being infected and the associated anguish. While all these situations represent favourable situations for biases that affect decision-making, we need to use the best evidence available regarding how to deal with and avoid biases in identifying and addressing decisions.",
