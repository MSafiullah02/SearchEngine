However, the widespread and indiscriminate use of powerful antibiotics in recent decades has led to a dramatic increase in microbial resistance, being nowadays a major threat to global public health [2]. There is a long list of identified drug-resistant bacteria, including sulfonamide-resistant, penicillin-resistant, methicillin-resistant, macrolide-resistant and vancomycin-resistant, or even multidrug-resistant. As a result, drug-resistant bacterial infections can result in the need to use a higher drug dosage, higher toxicity treatments and longer hospitalization periods, ultimately translated in increased mortality, thus negatively affecting both medicine and society [3]. Antimicrobial resistance is, nowadays, one of the major global economic and healthcare burdens and, despite the efforts in research and development of new molecular entities, the pipeline for new drugs tends to grow on empty [1].",

            "text": "Bacteriocins are peptides produced mainly by Gram-positive bacteria with the main purpose of self-preservation, while a large portion of Gram-negative bacteriocins resemble eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides such as defensins [4]. These antimicrobial peptides depict amphiphilic helices, differing among them in mode of action, biochemical properties and thus spectrum of activity. They are classified according to the host producer, intrinsic function, molecular weight, physicochemical properties and amino acid sequence. Meade et al. published a comprehensive analysis of their classification and use against multi-drug-resistant species [4]. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small peptide-based molecules, 5\u2013100 amino acids in length, with potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. AMPs are considered among the most promising drug candidates to be used against infections with the aim to overcome microbial drug resistance. However, they also display some limitations regarding bioavailability and safety, and may possess additional biological activities and functions. AMPs can indeed be used as signaling molecules, in tissue regeneration, as biomarkers and even as tumoricidal agents. AMPs are produced by nearly all living organisms and they act by binding to genetic material, by interacting with the cell wall, cell membrane and/or with intracellular organelles. They act by protecting plants against fungal and bacterial invasions, while in invertebrates and vertebrates they also have activity against parasite and viral invasions which may induce toxic events in the host eukaryotic cells. Table 1 summarizes their main mechanistic pathways. While the mechanisms of action of AMPs have not yet been fully described [5], it is known that AMPs can have receptor-mediated or non-receptor-mediated interactions with the cell membrane [6]. Most of the AMPs produced by bacteria undergo receptor-mediated interactions and are active in vitro at very low concentrations. However, in most vertebrates and invertebrates, AMPs target the membrane without specifically interacting with receptors and are active at concentrations in the micromolar range. They interact with components of the membrane, i.e., with the negative charge of lipids (e.g., lipopolysaccharides, cardiolipin) which attract the positively charged AMPs. Other AMPs may target the bacterial cell wall, inhibit cell wall synthesis or have intracellular targets. While most of the conventional antibiotics compromise the synthesis of cell wall components by binding to specific proteins involved in the reaction, AMPs often interact with precursor molecules needed for the synthesis of the cell wall. As AMPs are produced by several immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils), the peptides can also activate immune cells which may result in increased microbial killing and/or control of inflammation.",

Burrer et al. have used several strains of murine coronavirus in cell culture and in vivo in mouse models for the assessment of the antiviral properties of peptide-conjugated antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs) [8]. The authors have reported the targeting effect of P-PMOs against various target sites in the viral genome in cell culture and protected mice against virus-induced tissue damage. Ykeda et al. have used an antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin of Xenopus tropicalis (Pxt-5), and its modified peptide (Modify-Pxt-5) to produce self-assembled discoidal nanoparticles composed of amphiphilic alpha-helical scaffold proteins or peptides organised in a lipid bilayer [9]. Both the peptides Pxt-5, having hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces, behaved like general surfactants and can be used as carriers. Bacteriocins, while very active at low concentrations, usually have low in vivo stability, being susceptible to degradation by proteolytic enzymes [4]. Another major limitation on the use of these peptides is the difficulty encountered in their large-scale production, compromising altogether their clinical application. An approach to overcome their limited stability in vivo is their loading into nanoparticles.",

Nanotechnologies have also shown great potential in almost every aspect of the management of microbial infection with more than ten nanoparticles (NPs)-based products marketed for bacterial diagnosis, antibiotic delivery and medical devices in 2014. With unique physicochemical characteristics, nanomaterials are sensitive and selective in the detection of bacterial signalling and may also exbibit intrinsic antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, nanomaterials can be used for antimicrobial drug delivery, and the incorporation of antimicrobial nanomaterials in medical devices and implants can prevent microbial adhesion and infection [11,12]. All these facts are instrumental against antimicrobial resistance by compromising bacterial mechanisms of resistance [13]. Focusing on nanomaterials-based drug delivery systems, these offer an improved strategy to increase the therapeutic index, by decreasing the dosage and frequency of administration. Besides, nanomaterials promote intracellular drug delivery, mitigating the development of drug-resistant bacteria and also allowing targeted organ accumulation by functionalized surface modifications, thus limiting systemic side effects and immunosuppression [2]. Despite these promising outcomes, the main challenge of establishing clinical use is related to the evaluation of interactions of nano-antibiotics with cells, tissues and organs achieving information about their possible toxic effects, together with the production on a large scale [1,14,15].",

The main interesting property of AMPs is their ability to selectively disrupt bacterial membranes without affecting mammalian cells, thus being safe. In addition, AMPs are referred to in the literature as host-defence peptides with anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, because they are synthesized molecules that take action on the defence mechanisms against biological threats of the living organism of origin [16]. The discovery of AMPs dates back to the first half of the 20th century when in 1939, Dubos extracted an antimicrobial agent from a soil Bacillus strain, proven to be effective in mice pneumococci infection. This extract was then fractioned allowing the identification of gramicidin. Despite some systemic toxicity, gramicidin has shown to be effective in the topical treatment of wounds and ulcers. The first animal-originated AMP to be reported is defensin, isolated from rabbit leukocytes in 1956 [17]. Nowadays, more than 2000 AMPs have been described and current molecular developments can be consulted in a series of databases available on the web (Table 2), including natural identified molecules, as well as peptidomimetic molecules and analogues that are pharmacologically designed thanks to the use of bioinformatics [18]. Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved AMPs with well-established use include bacitracin, colistin and polymyxin B (although only for topical administration) [2].",

Associated with structural characteristics, these are also the main physicochemical properties that should also be taken into account in the design of new synthetic AMPs [17]. Compared to conventional antibiotics, AMPs demonstrate significant advantages such as potency and board spectrum of activity, as well as an additional activity to modulate the immune system responses and low resistance rates. They also show some limitations that impair their safe therapeutic use, such as sensitivity to proteolysis, influencing stability and undefined toxicological data for systemic use [20]. In addition, their cationic and amphiphilic nature lead to high binding to serum proteins after parenteral administration, with consequent rapid elimination from bloodstream circulation and accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, thus resulting in toxic effects and reduced activity [21]. To overcome these limitations, some strategies have been developed, maximizing the proven therapeutic potential of AMPs. There are numerous methods for obtaining AMP delivery systems. AMPs could be immobilized onto a variety of materials or onto a variety of surfaces and still retain their antibacterial activity. Also, AMPs can be targeted through loading them in nanoparticulate systems with selective delivery capacities, including polymers, liposomes, hydrogels, nanospheres, nano-capsules and carbon nanotubes [19]. As practical examples on of these of strategies, the studies of Mishra et al. were focused on the development of an AMP-coated surface, specifically immobilizing Lassioglossin-III onto silicone-based catheters and its activity against urinary tract infections [22]. At the same time, Water et al. developed the possibility of encapsulating plectasin, a cationic AMP, into polymeric NPs and evaluated their efficacy on S. aureus strains [23].",

Moreover, the development of even new mechanisms of resistance has resulted in the simultaneous development of resistance to several antibiotic classes creating very dangerous multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains [24,25]. However, when bacteria are drug-resistant it does not mean that they stop responding to an antibiotic, but that occurs only at higher concentrations [26,27]. Of greater concern are cases of acquired resistance, where initially susceptible populations of bacteria become resistant to an antibacterial agent, in particular antibiotics, and proliferate and spread under the selective pressure of use of that drug. One approach to address this challenge is to design analogues of drugs [28,29] that are already in clinical use and that have activity against resistant organisms. However, bacteria are constantly succeeding to develop a resistant mechanism to new antibiotic drugs as well as to their analogues [30,31]. ",

[32] and Shimanovich and Gedanken [33] clarifies microbial drug resistance mechanisms and how nanotechnology may be considered a tool against this issue. Development of drug resistance occurs in (at least) three steps: (i) acquisition by microbes of resistance genes; (ii) expression of those resistance genes; (iii) selection for microbes expressing those resistance genes. First, bacteria acquire resistance to single and multiple drugs through horizontal gene transfer by transformation, conjugation and transduction [34]. Bacteria can also acquire resistance genes by spontaneous mutation of existing genes [35]. MDR is acquired when a bacterial cell already containing one type of drug resistance gene acquires another type of drug resistance gene [34,36]. Second, in response to exposure to an antimicrobial drug, microbes express the resistance gene [36]. Third, resistance becomes widespread when there is selection for microbes that express resistance genes against the antimicrobial drug. This selective pressure in favour of resistance occurs whenever microbes are exposed to the drug but not eradicated (either by the microbicidal effects of the drug itself or by microbiostatic effects of the drug followed by killing by the host\u2019s immune system) [34]. A schematic representation of some specific mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance is shown in Figure 2.",

Unlike many antimicrobial agents currently being used in the clinic, antimicrobial NPs may not pose direct and acute adverse effects, although potential toxicity upon long-term exposure is questionable. Most importantly, antimicrobial NPs tackle multiple biological pathways found in broad species of microbes and many concurrent mutations would have to occur to develop resistance against NPs\u2019 antimicrobial activities. Preparation of antimicrobial NPs could be cost-effective, compared to antibiotics synthesis, furthermore they are stable enough for long-term storage with a prolonged shelf-life [37]. In addition, some NPs can withstand harsh conditions, such as high-temperature sterilization, under which conventional antibiotics are inactivated. Antibiotics delivery using nanomaterials offer multiple advantages: (i) controllable and relatively uniform distribution in the target tissue; (ii) improved solubility; (iii) sustained and controlled release; (iv) improved patient-compliance; (v) minimized side effects; and (vi) enhanced cellular internalization [16,37].",

Even if at the beginning, the research in this field was focused on the possibility to exploit gold NPs in combination to laser radiation, thus significantly reducing bacteria viability due to cell lysis and mechanical disruption [61]. Currently, two recent studies have been reported exploring the use of Au nanostructures for AMP delivery. Photoluminescent Au nanodots (AuNDs) were prepared by Chen et al. [39]. These AuNDs were functionalized with hybridized ligands, an antimicrobial peptide (surfactin; SFT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DT), on AuNPs. Ultrasmall SFT/DT\u2013Au NDs (size \u2248 2.5 nm) were achieved and exhibited highly efficient antimicrobial activity. The photoluminescence properties and stability as well as the antimicrobial activity of SFT/DT\u2013Au NDs were also studied, and it was shown that these characteristics are highly dependent on the density of SFT on Au NDs. Relative to SFT, SFT/DT\u2013AuNDs exhibited greater antimicrobial activity, not only to non-multidrug-resistant bacteria but also to the multidrug-resistant bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration values of SFT/DT\u2013AuNDs were much lower (>80-fold) than that of SFT. The authors considered that the antimicrobial activity of SFT/DT\u2013AuNDs was mainly achieved by the synergistic effect of SFT and DT\u2013AuNDs on the disruption of the bacterial membrane. In vitro cytotoxicity and hemolysis, analyses were also performed and had revealed superior biocompatibility of SFT/DT\u2013AuNDs than that of SFT. Moreover, in vivo methicillin-resistant S. aureus infected wound healing studies in rats showed faster healing, better epithelialization. This study suggested that the SFT/DT\u2013AuNDs system may be a promising antimicrobial candidate for preclinical applications in treating wounds and skin infections [39]. Rai et al. also reported a one-step methodology to generate AMP-conjugated (AuNPs) [40]. The AMP-conjugated AuNPs prepared showed controlled size (14 nm) and low polydispersity and allowed the inclusion of high concentration of AMPs. Further, these systems demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and stability in serum and in the presence of non-physiological concentrations of proteolytic enzymes than soluble AMP, as well as low cytotoxicity against human cells [40]. Interestingly, Akrami et al. showed the possibility to exploit gold NPs as a novel anticancer platform [41]. Results of this research confirm the improvement of cell internalization of gold NPs, with higher cytotoxicity and cellular uptake for smaller NPs compared to larger nanospheres and nanorods, suggesting that anticancer effects of the selected peptides were modulated by the size and shape of the gold nanoparticles [41].",

The obtained polymersomes were safe on human fibroblasts and more effective in inhibiting bacterial cells with a silver-to-ampicillin ratio of one to 0.64, respectively. Recent advances in AMP delivery by Ag nanostructures, Pazos et al. [43] reported on supramolecular assemblies of novel peptide amphiphiles (PAs) containing aldehyde functionality in order to reduce Ag ions and subsequently nucleate Ag metal NPs in water. This proposed system spontaneously generates monodisperse Ag particles at regular distances along the length of the filamentous organic assemblies. The metal\u2212organic hybrid structures exhibited antimicrobial activity and significantly less toxicity toward eukaryotic cells. Metallized organic nanofibers of the type described offer the possibility to create other structures. For instance, hydrogels, that can be potentially applied in wound dressing development [43]. Also addressing the wound infection problem, Salouti et al. investigated the synergistic antibacterial effect of plant peptide MBP-1 and AgNPs on infected wounds caused by S. aureus [44]. The MIC and MBC of MBP-1 and AgNPs both on their own and in combination form were determined against S. aureus via macrodilution and microdilution methods. The MIC and MBC of MBP-1 were found to be 0.6 and 0.7 mg/mL, respectively. MIC and MBC of AgNPs were determined to be 6.25 and 12.5 mg/L, respectively. MIC and MBC of the AgNPs and MBP-1 combination were found to be 3.125 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/L; and 6.25 mg/mL, 0.6 mg/L, respectively. The synergistic antibacterial effect of Ag NPs and MBP-1 was investigated on infected wounds caused by S. aureus in a mouse model, and the infected wound healed properly after the combined use of MBP-1 and AgNPs [44]. It is worth to note recent findings by Chaudhari et al. concerning the conjugation of silver-coated carbon nanotubes with the antimicrobial peptide TP359. Herein, authors underline the occurrence of an additive effect of silver-coated nanotubes and TP359 regarding antibacterial activity. The innovative nano-system was found to be safe to murine macrophages and Hep2 cells at the MIC concentrations [45].",

            "text": "As delivery systems for AMPs, silicon and silicon derivates nanostructures have also been investigated recently. Membrane interactions are critical for the successful use of mesoporous SiNPs. In order to elucidate these, Braun et al. have studied the effects of NP charge and porosity on AMP loading and release, as well as consequences of this for membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects [46]. Anionic mesoporous SiNPs were found to incorporate considerable amounts of the CAMP LL-37, whereas loading was found to be much lower for non-porous or positively charged SiNPs. The results also demonstrated that due to preferential pore localization, anionic mesoporous particles, but not the other particles, protects LL-37 from degradation by infection-related proteases. For anionic SiNPs, membrane disruption is mediated almost exclusively by peptide release. In contrast, non-porous SiNPs built up a resilient LL-37 surface coating due to their higher negative surface charge, and display largely particle-mediated membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects. For positively charged mesoporous SiNPs, LL-37 incorporation promoted the membrane binding and disruption displayed by the particles in the absence of peptide, but also caused toxicity against human erythrocytes. Thus, the use of mesoporous SiNPs as AMP delivery systems requires consideration of membrane interactions and selectivity of both free peptide and the peptide-loaded NPs [46]. The properties of AMPs adsorbed on inorganic or organic surfaces are of interest for their potential applications in intracellular drug delivery. In the work of Syryamina et al., continuous-wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) techniques were applied to study the adsorption of the AMPs trichogin GA IV and ampullosporin A on monodisperse colloidal silica nanospheres (SiNS) of 20 nm diameter [47]. The results obtained by CW EPR supported the view that the adsorbed peptides form close-packed clusters. PELDOR data show that both trichogin and ampullosporin adsorbed on the silica surface possess a more disordered conformation as compared to that in solution. For ampullosporin, disordering is much more pronounced than for trichogin. After desorption, the peptides restored their conformations; upon adsorption, the peptides in some cases may lose partly their biradical character [47]. These results may be of interest as the antimicrobial activity is often related to peptide conformation.",

They typically present a stacked arrangement of silicate layers with a nanometric thickness [62]. Meira et al. studied three different nano-clays (bentonite, octadecylamine-modified montmorillonite, and halloysite) as potential carriers for the AMPs nisin and pediocin, known bacteriocins, the first referred above as having application as a food preservative. Higher adsorption at room temperature of nisin and pediocin was obtained on bentonite. The antimicrobial activity of the resultant bacteriocin-nano-clay systems was analysed using skimmed milk agar as food simulant, and the largest inhibition zones were observed against Gram-positive bacteria for halloysite samples. Bacteriocins were intercalated into the interlayer space of montmorillonites as deduced from the increase of the basal spacing measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) assay. These results indicate that nano-clays, especially halloysite, are suitable nano-carriers for nisin and pediocin adsorption, and the results may be considered interesting for the food industry [48].",

The majority of polymeric NPs prepared with linear polymers are nano-capsules or solid nanospheres [69]. In polymeric nano-capsules, a polymeric membrane that controls the release rate surrounds the drugs that are solubilized in aqueous or oily solvents. In solid nanospheres, drugs are homogeneously distributed in the polymeric matrices of variable porosities [70,71]. Amphiphilic block copolymers form self-assemble micellar NPs with the drug being encapsulated in the hydrophobic core and surrounded by a hydrophilic shield. This shied allows the core to be protected from degradation [72]. Several biodegradable polymers, including poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(cyanoacrylate) (PCA), have been used as the hydrophobic core of the amphiphilic copolymers, whereas PEG has been the most commonly used hydrophilic segment [67,73,74,75,76].

The use of polymeric NPs can overcome the limited oral administration of unstable or inadequately absorbed drugs, [81] and, in addition, PEGylation of NPs, can increase drug half-life in serum, and improve mucoadhesive capabilities by reducing phagocytosis [82] Thus, among nanoparticle platforms, polymer NPs may be the most suitable system that can be used for antimicrobial drug delivery.

The development of polymeric therapeutic nanostructures for AMP delivery may offer an excellent technological strategy to improve drug bioavailability and safety. CS-based NPs (CSNPs) are particularly interesting as the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of CS is well known and documented, offering the possibility of synergistic effects with antimicrobial molecules. Moreover, due to its biocompatibility properties, CS nanostructures have been extensively studied for drug delivery, and that is no different for AMP delivery. In fact, the majority of the studies performed so far involves CS nanostructures and was already revised in previous work [84] from which we reproduce Table 4. Research has been covering, the technological development of new carrier systems and their full characterization, and the evaluation of their efficacy as drug delivery improvers. In addition to CS-based nanostructures, recent studies on other polymeric nanostructures for AMP delivery have been developed (Table 5).",

To this purpose, PLGA NPs containing a model CAMP, colistin (Col), were produced by the emulsion/solvent diffusion technique, and then spray-dried in different carriers (lactose or mannitol), thus producing NEM. The most promising NEM formulations were selected from bulk and flow properties, distribution of NPs in the carrier and aerosolization performance upon delivery through a breath-actuated dry powder inhaler. Col\u2013loaded NEM were found to kill P. aeruginosa biofilms and to display a prolonged efficacy compared to the free Col. [94]. Another CAMP, plectasin, was encapsulated into PLGA NPs using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method, in the work of Water et al. [23] The plectasin-loaded NPs displayed a high encapsulation efficiency (71\u201390%) and mediated release of the peptide over 24 h. The antimicrobial efficacy was investigated using bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cell monolayers infected with S. aureus, and encapsulated plectasin displayed improved efficacy as compared to non-encapsulated plectasin. The author also assessed the subcellular localization of the prepared NPs in different relevant cell lines: Calu-3 epithelial cells, THP-1 macrophages and A549 epithelial cells. Here the results have shown good patterns of penetration on Calu-3 epithelial cell lines, as well as in THP-1 macrophages [23].",

            "text": "Hydrogels and nanogels are an important class of biomaterials that have been widely utilized for a variety of biomedical/medical applications. The biological performance of these systems, particularly those used as wound dressing; can be complemented with antimicrobial activity capable of preventing colonization of the wound site by opportunistic bacterial pathogens [90,100,101]. These types of structures have also been studied recently for AMP delivery. Continuing their study of the antimicrobial activity of multi-domain CAMPs (MD-CAMPs) in solution, Jiang et al. investigated the same effect of self-assembled 3-D hydrogels supramolecular nanostructures and its rheological properties [95]. Among the studied MD-CAMPs solutions, the bactericidal activity of peptide hydrogels was found to be improved. The improved antimicrobial activity of the self-assembled peptide hydrogels was found to be related to the combined effect of supramolecular surface chemistry and storage modulus of the bulk materials, rather than the ability of individual peptides/peptide assemblies to penetrate bacterial cell membrane as observed in solution. Thus, the structure\u2013property\u2013activity relationship developed through this study may provide important knowledge for designing biocompatible peptide hydrogels with built-in antimicrobial activity for various biomedical applications [95]. The Water et al. group also designed novel nanogel-based novicidin delivery system. The peptide novicidin was self-assembled with a nano-ctenyl succinic anhydride-modified analogue of hyaluronic acid, and this formulation was optimized using a microfluidics-based quality-by-design approach. The encapsulation efficiency of novicidin (15\u201371%) and the zeta potential (\u221224 to \u221257 mV) of the nanogels could be tailored by changing the preparation process parameters, with a maximum peptide loading of 36 \u00b1 4%. The nanogels exhibited good colloidal stability under different ionic strength conditions and allowed complete release of the peptide over 14 days. Furthermore, self-assembly of novicidin with hyaluronic acid into nanogels significantly improved the safety profile at least five-fold and six-fold when tested in HUVECs and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively, while showing no loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus [96]. Li et al. explored the potential application of AMPs in wound healing, by developing a biodegradable poly(L-lactic acid)-Pluronic L35-poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA-L35-PLLA) in situ gel-forming system [97]. An injectable formulation composed of human AMPs 57 (AP-57) loaded NPs, and thermosensitive hydrogel was prepared. AP-57 peptides were enclosed with biocompatible NPs (AP-57-NPs) with high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency. AP-57-NPs were further encapsulated in a thermosensitive hydrogel (AP-57-NPs-H) to facilitate its application in cutaneous wound repair. As a result, AP-57-NPs-H released AP-57 in an extended period and exhibited quite low cytotoxicity and high anti-oxidant activity in vitro. The in vivo wound healing assay using a full-thickness dermal defect model of SD rats indicated that AP-57-NPs-H could significantly promote wound healing. At day 14 after an operation, the treated group showed nearly complete wound closure of 96, 78 \u00b1 3, 12% [97]. Other studies of nisin nanoencapsulation were performed, with the purpose of protection to ensure the stability of this AMP during food processing and storage period. Nisin-loaded pectin NPs (NLP-NPs) were prepared and analysed by Krivirotova et al. by a simple complexation method [98]. Three types of pectin biopolymer were tested and it was found that the methoxylation degree of pectin influenced nisin loading efficiency and particle size. For the complex formation, both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were important. NLP-NPs exhibited antimicrobial activity that was dependent on the type of biopolymer. Overall, the results indicated that NLP-NPs might be a suitable antimicrobial system to be used in the food industry [98]. Nisin nanoencapsulation in self-assembly chitosan- and poly- glutamic acid, was recently reported by Wu et al. [99]. Herein, the authors showed that the use of a coating layer of chitosan improved colloidal stability, loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency. Furthermore, chitosan layer composite nanoparticles were more effective compared to uncoated NPs and nisin in inhibiting the growth of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes.",

While SLN are composed of solid lipids only, NLC matrix is a blend of solid and liquid lipids (which also melts above the body temperature) to improve the solubility of lipophilic compounds.

Fumakia et al. have developed SLN for the simultaneous delivery of an endogenous host defence peptide (LL37) with antimicrobial activity and an elastase inhibitor serpin A1 (A1) for the treatment of wound infections [112]. The authors reported that SLN could modify the release profile of simultaneous delivery of both bioactives, accelerate wound healing in BJ fibroblast cells and keratinocytes and promote antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in comparison to LL37 or A1 alone.

Zhong et al. synthesized surface-modified carbon dots with vancomycin and successfully tested them against Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The modified carbon dots showed affinity to the tested Gram-positive bacteria owing to the ligand\u2013receptor interactions between vancomycin and the cell walls. Pramanik et al. synthesis red/blue fluorescent carbon dot-attached magnetic nanoparticles for selective separation and identification of superbugs from infected blood samples [118]. The nanoparticles were capable of isolating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Salmonella DT104 superbug from whole blood samples, followed by accurate identification via multicolor fluorescence imaging.

            "text": "AMPs are antimicrobial compounds recognized as among the most promising drug candidates against infections. They exhibit distinct mechanisms of action and may show additional biological activities, e.g., as signalling molecules and biomarkers, and even as tumoricidal agents. AMPs, however, show low stability and bioavailability. The formulation of AMPs into nanomaterials seems to offer a very appealing and effective manner to improve these limitations, and several systems have been designed and studied for this purpose (e.g., inorganic, polymeric and lipid nanoparticles, carbon dots and dendrimers). However, concerns on how to regulate the distribution of nanomaterials in the body or specific organs are also raised. Nano-drugs are foreign substances to the body and may produce inflammation. Therefore, safety data for long-term therapy or repeated dosage are needed to circumvent the potential risk. Biodegradable nanomaterials have been proposed to reduce the risk of toxicological events both in vitro and in vivo. To date, few studies have investigated the toxicological and environmental effects of direct and indirect exposure to nanomaterials, and no clear guidelines exist to quantify these effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing guidelines, which can assure the safe use of nanomaterials. Moreover, more powerful ex vivo models or animal models are needed to assess the safety issues and to comply with government regulations. How to extend the shelf life of nanodrugs is also a problem due to their agglomeration also being a problem. The production methods for nanostructures should also be improved, and scalable studies for industrial production are also of great importance in order to promote cost effectiveness of these new formulations. The cost and production of nanomaterials on a large scale is one of the hurdles in effective implementation of these products. Hence, the scientific community should also pay attention to developing affordable methodologies so that nanotechnology can reach patients. In conclusion, it seems that, although the promising research results in this area are rising, it is also urgent to start directing efforts in making these new drug formulations a reality as therapeutic agents.",
