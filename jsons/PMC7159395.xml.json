In late August 2011, these fish of approximately 11.5 cm TL were transferred to WRH, where 800 of them were immediately stocked into a 2,023\u2010m2, lined, outdoor pond, while another 1,000 Muskellunge were stocked into a 4,047\u2010m2, lined, outdoor pond. The ponds were supplied with 21\u00b0C well water that had been first degassed and oxygenated, then passed through trout\u2010rearing raceways and treated with ultraviolet (UV) light before filling the ponds. These ponds were prestocked with 726 kg (1,600 lb) of Fathead Minnows (TL < 4 cm) that had been reared intensively on pellet feed at a commercial baitfish facility and, according to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection requirements, were health certified, which included visual examination for disease signs and laboratory testing for the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (Novirhabdovirus, Rhabdoviridae). Within 3 weeks of arrival at WRH, the Muskellunge became sick, and some suffered morbidity and mortality. Initial low\u2010level mortality rates increased to 10\u201320 fish (0.5\u20131%) per day within 60 d. In early October, a sample of eight moribund Muskellunge with a mean TL of 15.5 cm (SD, 0.64) and mean weight of 14.5 g (SD, 2.0) from WRH was submitted for analysis to the Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory at Michigan State University (MSU\u2010AAHL) to identify the cause of mortality. The fish exhibited pale gills and external petechial hemorrhages and were individually subjected to clinical and laboratory health assessments according to the guidelines outlined by the American Fisheries Society's Fish Health Section (AFS\u2013FHS 2012, 2014). In late November of the same year, 60 Muskellunge with a mean TL of 19.5 cm (SD, 1.27) and mean weight of 28.9 g (SD, 6.84) from the originating stock at WLSFH were collected after being fed on commercial minnows for 7 weeks and were analyzed in pools of five fish at MSU\u2010AAHL for the presence of pathogens. These fish had not been experiencing elevated mortality and were apparently healthy. The two hatcheries obtained their minnows from different baitfish collection facilities.",

            "text": "Several RT\u2010PCR assay protocols were used in this study to determine the identity of the isolated viruses. Since isolated viruses produced giant cell formation (syncytia) in the EPC cell line, our efforts were directed to aquareoviruses and nidoviruses of nonsalmonids known to cause this kind of CPE. To test for aquareoviruses, the RT\u2010PCR assay developed by Seng et al. (2004) for the rapid and accurate detection of a variety of aquareovirus strains isolated from different host species and origin was employed in this study. For the identification of FHMNV, two primer sets were used. The first is an RT\u2010PCR assay that specifically targets a region of the spike glycoprotein gene of FHMNV developed by Batts et al. (2012). Additionally, since the helicase genes of nidoviruses contain a number of conserved domains (Lehmann et al. 2015), an RT\u2010PCR was developed and used to specifically target a region of the helicase gene of the FHMNV and allow for greater phylogenetic characterization of FHMNV isolates. The RT\u2010PCR assays for the detection of FHMNV were performed using the primers listed in Table 1. Each 25 \u00b5L of the PCR mixture consisted of 12.5 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 Green GoTaq Master Mix (Promega), 1.0 \u03bcM of each primer, and 2.5 \u00b5L of template cDNA. The RT\u2010PCR conditions for all assays were as follows: initial 94.0\u00b0C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94.0\u00b0C for 30 s, 50.0\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72.0\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension of 72.0\u00b0C for 7 min.",

These viruses were selected because WBV is the most closely related virus to FHMNV and the only other known virus within the genus Bafinivirus (Batts et al. 2012).

A total of 24 candidate models, including models with equal or unequal base frequencies, with or without a proportion of invariable sites (+I), and with or without rate variation among sites (+G) were tested. The best\u2010fit model of nucleotide substitution was using the general time reversible (GTR) model (Rodriguez et al. 1990). Tree topologies were inferred with a Bayesian approach using MRBAYES version 3.2.4 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) with the selected model of nucleotide substitution. Bayesian analysis included four Markov chain\u2013Monte Carlos (MCMC) for 4,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100th generation.

Upon experimental infection, the virus was isolated from internal organs suggesting, as was demonstrated in the case of Fathead Minnows, the infection is also systemic in Muskellunge. Since experimental infection in this study was performed by i.p. injection, it is currently unknown how the virus is transmitted under natural conditions (e.g., cohabitation with or ingestion of infected fish). Regardless of the route of infection (natural or by injection), it is clear that FHMNV can cause significant necrotic changes in hematopoietic tissues in multiple organs such as liver, kidneys, and spleen, a matter that may affect the ability of resident white blood cells to mount potent immune responses (Bromage et al. 2004; Ma et al. 2013). The studies of Iwanowicz and Goodwin (2002) described similar lesions in the liver, kidneys, and spleen of experimentally infected Fathead Minnows. There are currently no data available on cells or tissues targeted by the other bafiniviruses; the WBV was isolated from the White Bream Blicca bjoerkna (Order Cypriniformes) in 2001 during a wild fish disease survey and its pathogenicity has never been ascertained (Sch\u00fctze et al. 2006). Other animal nidoviruses target a variety of tissue types such as the respiratory tract (Gu and Korteweg 2007) and central nervous system (Gu and Korteweg 2007; Diaz and Poma 2009), as well as lymphoid tissues and various immune cells (Spann et al. 2003; Gu and Korteweg 2007).",

It is also unknown whether MUS\u2010WL or MUS\u2010WR FHMNV strains are associated with Muskellunge only; however, it is unlikely that the infection in WRH Muskellunge originated from WLSFH since both FHMNV strains have some nucleotide and amino acid differences from one another.",

In the current study, we developed an additional one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR that allows for the specific detection of FHMNV. The primers target a large portion of the helicase gene, a gene that plays a critical role in nidovirus replication, transcription, and virion morphogenesis (van Dinten et al. 2000; Seybert et al. 2005).
