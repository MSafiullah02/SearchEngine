Y. Yuen (University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong). The recombinant N protein was expressed by transformation of BL21 (DE3) Singles Competent Cells (Novagen) by the plasmid and was purified by the Ni2+ -loaded HiTrap chelating system (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, transformed cells were disrupted, and the protein sample was prepared by isolation of inclusion bodies via sonication and washing. The protein sample was loaded onto the HiTrap chelating HP column prepacked with precharged Ni+2 Sepharose High Performance. The protein then was purified and refolded by serial buffer washes of the column and by liquid chromatography in an FPLC system (Pharmacia LBK Biotechnology), with elution of protein, which was collected in fractions. The fractions were analyzed for the presence of 53-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and was adjusted to 3 \u03bcg/mL in the ELISA. Mock antigen was produced from the same plasmid DNA vector, but without the N protein gene sequence, by the same procedure",

The frequency of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections that were associated with acute respiratory illnesses was similar to that for LDI infection. We may have underestimated the number of HCoV-associated illnesses; illnesses not meeting our criteria for evaluation were not assessed, and an end-of-study serum sample was not obtained, so we were unable to estimate the frequency of HCoV infections in the 1630 patients who did not have an acute respiratory illness. HCoV-associated illnesses were identified at diverse geographic sites within the continental United States and Puerto Rico. More than 80% of the HCoV-associated infections were characterized by new or increased cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue and/or malaise. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, HCoV-associated illness was statistically less likely than LDI to be associated with myalgia. Hence, HCoV infections were difficult to distinguish from LDI in this influenza-vaccinated population, whose influenza-associated illnesses may have been less severe than those in an unvaccinated population. Illnesses not associated with either HCoV or LDI were not easily distinguishable, statistically, from HCoV. In previous analyses, influenza was more likely to be associated with fever, myalgia, and a worsening in FEV1 than were noninfluenza acute respiratory illnesses [47, 48]. Acute respiratory illness, no matter the cause, was associated with significant worsening in the CLDSI score, but, on the basis of changes in FEV1, HCoV appeared to be less severe",

For instance, 22.9% of 70 virus-associated respiratory-tract infections in patients with COPD that were reported by Greenberg et al. were due to either HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 [8]. In a community-based study of elderly patients conducted during 1998\u20131999, Graat et al. [12] reported that 17% of 108 respiratory infections were due to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 and that this frequency was second to that for rhinoviruses. As in the present study, HCoV-OC43 also predominated over HCoV-229E in a number of other studies [5, 6, 8, 15, 23, 30, 49], whereas HCoV-NL63 and HCoV\u2013HKU1 predominated in 2 recent studies [26, 50].

Falsey et al. [11] have reported that 8 of 100 hospitalized elderly patients had concomitant HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 infection. In the present study, hospitalization was associated with respiratory infection in all illness groups, both during the month immediately after the visit for the first episode of acute respiratory illness and throughout the study follow-up. There was a lower rate of hospitalization in the group without an acute respiratory illness that qualified for evaluation by the present study; during the study follow-up, the overall mean number of hospitalizations per patient in the HCoV-infected group was more than double that in the no-illness group. In all illness groups, prednisone use increased during the study",

The illnesses are listed in chronological order (regardless of whether the illness is a first episode of acute respiratory illness), by calendar month, from the beginning of October 1998 to April 1999 (the end of follow-up). Included among these 93 illnesses are 3 (2 HCoV-229E and 1 HCoV-OC43) that were not among the 665 illnesses that were assessable. For the patients infected with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the other respiratory illnesses, occurring before or after the HCoV-associated illness, are also shown. Of the patients with an illness associated with either HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43, 1 had laboratory-documented influenza (LDI) before the HCoV illness, 4 had an HCoV illness before LDI, 13 had LDI concurrent with the HCoV infection during the illness, 9 had a non-HCoV/non-LDI illness before the HCoV illness, and 12 had either an HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 illness before a non-HCoV/non-LDI illness. Each row represents 1 patient, and the reporting site is identified by the 2-letter code for US states and Puerto Rico (PR), to the left of the graph. Of 20 sites, 19 in 13 states and PR reported illnesses associated with HCoV (HCoV-229E in 11 states and HCoV-OC43 in 12 states and PR). HCoV-associated illnesses were reported by 2 sites in Florida, 2 in Southern and 1 in Northern California, 2 in Texas, and 2 in Virginia; study sites reporting the most HCoV-229E and -OC43-associated illnesses were in Virginia (15 illnesses), Alabama (13 illnesses), Minnesota (10 illnesses), Missouri (9 illnesses), and Texas (9 illnesses). The cumulative numbers of illnesses of HCoV-associated illnesses, regardless of whether it was a first episode of acute respiratory illness and including those associated with HCoV and those with both HCoV and LDI, are graphed by calendar month (the cumulative number is that which occurred up to the beginning of the corresponding month); 32 HCoV-associated illnesses (5 HCoV-229E and 27 HCoV-OC43) occurred by the end of 1998, and 61 occurred during 1999 (19 HCoV-229E, 41 HCoV-OC43, and 1 with both strains). The only period when HCoV-229E\u2013associated illnesses predominated was after February 1999 (10 HCoV-229E and 7 HCoV-OC43)",
