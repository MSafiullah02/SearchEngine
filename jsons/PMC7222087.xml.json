The dream of replacing a nonfunctioning organ, like a kidney or a liver, with a functioning organ became a reality in 1954, when Dr. Joseph Murray transplanted a kidney from one identical twin to the other [1, 2]. Over the past few years, there has been a significant improvement in survival and reduction in rejection after solid organ transplantation (SOT) as a result of more effective immunosuppression therapy. However, infections and particularly bloodstream infections (BSIs) still remain as a common complication and a major cause of death after transplant [3\u20135].",

The risk of fungal infection is also higher in patients with kidney failure and history recent hospitalization.

Infections are usually caused by Gram-negative bacteria from intestinal origin, but Gram-positive bacteria are also common, particularly in hospitalized patients [9]. Fungal infections, mainly caused by Candida species, can also occur and are associated with high mortality rates [19]. Spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) is associated with higher mortality compared with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) [20]. Candida albicans is the most frequent fungal agent followed by Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus species. Clinicians should also consider the presence of polymicrobial fungal infections. In fact, while polymicrobial bacterial infections affect 5.2\u201317.4% of cases, polymicrobial fungal infections occurred in 73.3\u2013100% of patients with systemic fungal infections in a small case series [20].",

Antifungal drugs may also be started empirically for patients who are not responding to antibiotics [11]. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone constitute the first-line treatment for community-acquired SBP and/or bacteremia, while broad-spectrum beta-lactams or carbapenems with or without vancomycin are considered the first-line treatment for nosocomial SBP and/or bacteremia [9]. Local resistance patterns should help guide empiric antibiotic therapy. Echinocandins like caspofungin should be considered empirical or preemptive therapy for patients with suspected SFP [20]. In patients with ESLD and SBP who are treated with antibiotics, intravenous administration of 20% albumin reduces the incidence of renal failure and decreased mortality rates from 29 to 10% [9]. Recommendations regarding empirical antibiotic treatment in patient with ESLD before liver transplantation have been summarized in Table 1 [9].

Community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia account for 40.7% and 59.3% of pneumonias in SOT, respectively. Hospital- or ventilator-associated pneumonia are typically diagnosed in the early post-transplant period with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, Acinetobacter species, Stenotrophomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA as the most common pathogens in the peri-operative period. Opportunistic infections are most commonly seen in 1\u20136 months after transplant, and community-acquired pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma species, Legionella species, and Chlamydia species, are more frequent after 6 months, though opportunistic infections can still be seen, especially if immunosuppression is increased for treatment of rejection.",

For hospital-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, The ID Society of America and American Society of Transplantation guidelines on pneumonia should be followed in conjunction with local antibiogram [48\u2022\u2022, 49]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with an activity against P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacilli should be started empirically. For patients with septic shock and need for new ventilatory support, two agents with activity against P. aeruginosa can be considered. In patients with a high risk of mortality, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit with > 20% MRSA prevalence, an anti-MRSA agent should also be started empirically. Empiric treatment should be modified based on previous microbiologic history and local antibiogram as well as patient\u2019s clinical response. An active agent against intracellular organisms and during the influenza season, anti-influenza agents are also recommended for empiric treatment until these infections are ruled out.",

Mucormycosis is the next most common mold infection. Cryptococcosis and endemic fungi are other etiologies for IFIs [39, 47]. Echinocandins like caspofungin are recommended for treatment of Candida sp.

Oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin are currently the first-line therapies for an initial episode of CDI. Oral metronidazole is only recommended for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI if oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin are not available [55]. Fidaxomicin has similar efficacy to vancomycin and has been associated with decreased rates of recurrent infection in immunocompetent patients; however, there is limited data on its efficacy in solid organ transplant patients [56\u2022\u2022]. For fulminant CDI, oral vancomycin (or rectal vancomycin for cases with ileus) in conjunction with intravenous metronidazole is recommended. Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is the standard of care when toxic megacolon, perforation, or an acute surgical abdomen is present. Leukocytosis > 50,000/\u03bcL, lactate \u2265 5 mmol/L, and hypoalbuminemia are associated with impending shock. Urgent colectomy should be considered in these patients [57]. Fecal microbiota transfer is recommended in immunocompetent patients with multiple recurrence of CDI. Retrospective studies have reported efficacy and safety in SOT patients with recurrent CDI. Bezlotoxumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B, can be given to SOT patients with recurrent episodes of CDI [56\u2022\u2022].",
