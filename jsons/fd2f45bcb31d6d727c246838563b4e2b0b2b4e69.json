            "text": "CD13 is a membrane-bound ectopeptidase, highly expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. CD13 is involved in diverse functions, including degradation of peptide mediators, cellular adhesion, migration, viral endocytosis, signaling, and positive modulation of phagocytosis mediated by FcgRs and other phagocytic receptors. In this work, we explored whether besides acting as an accessory receptor, CD13 by itself is a primary phagocytic receptor. We found that hCD13 mediates efficient phagocytosis of large particles (erythrocytes) modified so as to interact with the cell only through CD13 in human macrophages and THP-1 monocytic cells. The extent of this phagocytosis is comparable with the phagocytosis mediated through the canonical phagocytic receptor FcgRI. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hCD13 expression in the nonphagocytic cell line HEK293 is sufficient to enable these cells to internalize particles bound through hCD13. CD13-mediated phagocytosis is independent of other phagocytic receptors, as it occurs in the absence of FcgRs, CR3, and most phagocytic receptors. Phagocytosis through CD13 is independent of its enzymatic activity but is dependent on actin rearrangement and activation of PI3K and is partially dependent on Syk activation. Moreover, the cross-linking of CD13 with antibodies rapidly induced pSyk in human macrophages. Finally, we observed that antibody-mediated cross-linking of hCD13, expressed in the murine macrophage-like J774 cell line, induces production of ROS. These results demonstrate that CD13 is a fully competent phagocytic receptor capable of mediating internalization of large particles. J. Leukoc. Biol. 98: 85-98; 2015.

Phagocytosis is a receptor-mediated event.

Receptors able to mediate phagocytosis are structurally diverse and include a variety of receptor families [1, 2] , such as FcgRs (FcgRI, -IIa, -IIc, and -IIIa), integrins (such as CR3, CR4, a 5 b 1 , a v b 3 , and LFA-1) [3] [4] [5] [6] , scavenger receptors (such as scavenger receptor I, CD36, MARCO) [7] [8] [9] , C-type lectin receptors (such as Dectin-1, dendritic cell-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin, mannose receptor), glycoproteins (such as CD44) [10] , and adhesion molecules (such as carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3) [11] .

Interestingly, their participation in such processes is not always dependent on their peptidase activity [12] . Aminopeptidase N/CD13 is a transmembrane ectoenzyme expressed in several tissues. Among hematopoietic cells, CD13 expression is restricted to stem cells and most developmental stages of myeloid cells, to such an extent that CD13 has been considered a myelomonocytic marker [13] . CD13 cleaves N-terminal neutral amino acids of small peptides, and its substrates and functions vary according to the tissue where it is expressed. However, additional functions, independent of its enzymatic activity, have been attributed to CD13 [14] . Inhibition of CD13 enzymatic activity by pharmacological inhibitors, active-site mutations or inhibitory antibodies, is evidence that at least 3 types of functions of CD13 do not require its enzymatic activity: 1) as a viral receptor [15] [16] [17] , 2) as an adhesion molecule [18] [19] [20] , and 3) as a signaling molecule [20] [21] [22] [23] . Interestingly, all of these functions rely on CD13 crosslinking on the plasma membrane by antibodies or viral ligands, which presumably leads to signal transduction.",

            "text": "Structurally, CD13 is a heavily glycosylated type II membrane protein with a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain of 8 aa. Despite having a very short cytoplasmic region, CD13 cross-linking by antibodies or viral ligands induces intracellular signals, such as intracellular Ca 2+ increases; activation of Src, PI3K, FAK, and the Ras/MAPK pathway; cytokine secretion [20, 23, 24] ; and CD13 association to actin fibers [20, 25] . Given that the short intracellular domain of CD13 contains no classic signaling motifs, it has been proposed that CD13 might require an auxiliary protein to transduce signals. In line with this, CD13 coimmunoprecipitates with the adaptor molecules Grb2/Sos in U-937 monocytes [18] , providing a possible link between CD13 aggregation and MAPK signaling. Furthermore, a recent report showed that CD13 is constitutively associated to the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 and that upon CD13 aggregation, a-actinin is recruited into the complex, linking membrane-bound CD13 to the cytoskeleton [20] . However, that same study showed that upon aggregation, CD13 is phosphorylated on the Tyr6 of its cytoplasmic domain in a Src-dependent manner and that this phosphorylation is required for ERK and FAK activation, as well as for CD13-mediated adhesion [20] . This observation emphasizes that despite being very short, the cytoplasmic region of CD13 participates directly in cellular signaling.",

            "text": "We [18, 19] and others [20, 26] have shown that antibodyinduced CD13 aggregation mediates monocyte-monocyte and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion in vitro and in vivo in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. Phagocytosis shares biochemical mechanisms with adhesion, spreading, and migration, as all of these processes require coordinated cytoskeletal reorganization. Indeed, there are several examples of membrane molecules that work as cell adhesion molecules and phagocytic receptors, including CR3 [27, 28] , CD44 [10, 29] , CD36 [30] , and a V b 3 integrin [5] , among others [31] . The first suggestion that CD13 was possibly involved in phagocytosis dates back to 1996, when a positive correlation between CD13 expression and phagocytosis of microspheres was observed in hMDMs [32] . We have reported previously that CD13 cross-linking by antibodies during phagocytosis of zymosan particles or heat-killed Escherichia coli led to a more efficient uptake in macrophages and dendritic cells [33] . Furthermore, an increase in FcgRI-mediated phagocytosis was also observed in monocytes and macrophages when particles interacted simultaneously with CD13 and FcgRI compared with the phagocytosis of particles interacting with FcgRI alone. Likewise, the cocross-linking of CD13 with FcgRI by specifc mAb increases the pSyk level and duration compared with crosslinking FcgRI alone [34] . These results suggest that CD13 aggregation can trigger signaling pathways required for phagocytosis. Finally, some data in our previous works also suggested that besides acting as a positive modulator of phagocytosis, CD13 might function as a phagocytic receptor in U-937 [34] and dendritic cells [33] , although this was not studied thoroughly. In this paper, we examined whether CD13 can function as a primary phagocytic receptor. We found that CD13 is a competent phagocytic receptor capable of mediating phagocytosis of large particles independently of other phagocytic receptors, the signaling pathway required for phagocytosis through CD13 involves Syk and PI3K, and finally, that CD13 cross-linking induces ROS production.",

Supernatants containing the lentiviral particles were harvested at 36 hours after transfection. Lentiviral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and used immediately for cell transduction.",

Erythrocytes loaded with CFSE and labeled with biotin-streptavidin, were coated with biotin-F(ab)9 2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG (EBS-Fab). These EBS-Fabs would only interact with molecules on the cell surface with bound Fab fragments of specific murine mAb. As the specificity of the system is based on antibodies, and several cells used in this work express FcgRs, we used Fab fragments to exclude any possible contribution of FcgRs to the phagocytosis (Fig. 1A) . Cells were preincubated on ice with Fab fragments of anti-CD13 mAb452 (Fab452), Fab fragments of anti-FcgRI mAb32.2 (Fab32.2) as positive control, an isotype control antibody (murine IgG1), or no treatment (basal phagocytosis). Cells were washed, mixed with EBS-Fab, and incubated at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C for the time periods indicated. After incubation, noninternalized erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock. The percentage of cells with internalized erythrocytes (CFSE-positive cells) was determined by flow cytometry after quenching any extracellular fluorescence by use of Trypan blue. We found that the binding of EBS-Fab to the cells through CD13 induced its efficient internalization by the human monocytic cell line THP-1 (mean 28.5%) compared with isotype-matched control antibody (mean 2.5%) or no treatment (mean 3.6%; Fig. 1B and C; n = 25). As a positive control, we measured the phagocytosis through the high-affinity receptor FcgRI (mean 33.5%). As expected, no significant internalization was observed when identical samples were kept at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 1B, lower) .",

The level of CD13-mediated phagocytosis is comparable with that mediated by FcgRI (mean 38.5%; Fig. 2A and B; n = 14). No significant internalization was observed when identical samples were kept at 4\u00b0C ( Fig. 2A, lower) The percentage of cells internalizing erythrocytes through CD13 was somewhat lower than the percentage of cells internalizing erythrocytes through FcgRI, both in THP-1 cells and in hMDMs. This was not a result of a lower binding of Fab fragments to CD13 compared with fragments bound to FcgRI, as anti-CD13 Fab fragments and anti-FcgRI Fab fragments showed similar levels of binding to the cells at the concentrations used in these assays (Figs. 1D and 2C). When we compared the PI (PI = % CFSEpositive cells multiplied by mean fluorescence intensity), we obtained similar results to those from comparing the positive cell percentage, as the mean PI of internalization through FcgRI is slightly higher than the mean PI through CD13, both in THP-1 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1A ) and in macrophages (Supplemental Fig. 1B) . Hence, in this system, although phagocytosis through the canonic phagocytic receptor FcgRI is higher, phagocytosis through CD13 is fully competent, reaching levels of .80% of FcgRI-mediated phagocytosis. To ascertain further that cellassociated fluorescence truly represents CD13-mediated internalization of EBS-Fabs, we verified particle uptake by light (not shown) and confocal microscopy. Typical confocal microscopic images of the internalization of EBS-Fab through CD13 in THP-1 and MDMs are shown in Figs. 1E and 2D, respectively. The number of internalized particles/cell was similar after internalization through CD13 or FcgRI in THP-1 cells and MDMs, in line with the comparison between PIs. Importantly, particles visualized inside of the cells after internalization through CD13 or FcgRI are of similar size, both in THP-1 cells (Fig. 1E ) and in MDMs (Fig.  2D ). Phagocytosed particles are ;4 mm in size, which rules out other forms of internalization, such as caveolae-mediated endocytosis [characterized by small (50-80 nm) vesicles) or clathrinmediated endocytosis (characterized by 100 nm vesicles)]. Altogether, these data indicate that CD13 is capable of mediating phagocytosis of large ($4 mm) particles.",

Notably, phagocytosis of EBS-Fabs through FcgRI ( Fig. 3B and C) was not impaired in CD13-deficient cells (L2), demonstrating that these cells are otherwise competent phagocytes. The increase in phagocytosis through FcgRI in L2 cells compared with control cells is not statistically significant and might be explained by the fact that FcgRI expression is higher in L2 cells. These results are in line with recent work in murine CD13 null animals [35] , which showed that lack of CD13 does not affect FcgR-mediated phagocytosis. However, it is important to stress that although the absence of CD13 does not impair phagocytosis through FcgRs, cross-linking of CD13 positively regulates phagocytosis through FcgRs, as we reported previously [34] .",

            "text": "Actin dynamics for phagocytosis are regulated by signaling pathways activated downstream of ligated phagocytic receptors. The best-understood signaling pathways during phagocytosis are those triggered by the opsonic receptors FcgRs and CR3. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk becomes activated by phosphorylation upon FcgR or CR3 cross-linking by antibodies or ligand-bearing particles [1] . Several studies have demonstrated that Syk is required for FcgR-mediated phagocytosis, but the role of Syk in CR3-mediated phagocytosis has been somewhat controversial, as CR3 phagocytosis is normal in Syk-deficient macrophages [36] but is severely impaired by transfer of Syk-siRNA or dominant-negative Syk into macrophage-like, differentiated HL-60 cells [37] . In the case of the b-glucan receptor Dectin-1, it has been shown that although Dectin-1 activates Syk, phagocytosis through Dectin-1 is independent of Syk in macrophages but dependent on Syk in fibroblasts, suggesting that Dectin-1-mediated phagocytosis involves novel signaling kinases as well as Syk [38, 39] . Therefore, it seems that Syk activation is not indispensable for all types of phagocytic receptors, even though they are able to activate Syk upon ligation. To investigate whether CD13-mediated phagocytosis is dependent on Syk activation, we used the pharmacological inhibitor of Syk, piceatannol. We preincubated THP-1 cells or hMDMs in the presence of 50 mM piceatannol or DMSO as vehicle control and measured phagocytosis of EBS-Fabs. Treatment of cells with piceatannol completely abolished phagocytosis mediated through CD13 in hMDMs ( Fig. 5A ; mean DMSO 24.7% vs. piceatannol 6.0%, n = 5) and in THP-1 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2A ; mean DMSO 25.3% vs. piceatannol 6.3%, n = 8). As shown in Fig. 5A (and Supplemental Fig. 2A) , treatment of cells with Fab452 and piceatannol resulted in CFSE-positive cell percentages similar to background phagocytosis (No Fab; dotted line), both in hMDMs and THP-1 cells. Phagocytosis, through FcgRI, as anticipated, was also abolished by treatment of cells with piceatannol in hMDMs and THP-1 cells (Fig. 5A and Supplemental Fig. 2A ). To be fully certain about the role of Syk in CD13-mediated phagocytosis, we used a second, more specific Syk inhibitor, BAY, reported to have .600-fold selectivity for Syk than against other kinases, as piceatannol, although used extensively as a Syk inhibitor, has only ;10-fold selectivity for Syk over other kinases involved in phagocytosis, including PI3K and Src kinases [40, 41] . We preincubated hMDMs in medium with 1 or 10 mM BAY or DMSO as vehicle control and measured phagocytosis of EBS-Fabs. As shown in Fig. 5B , CD13-mediated phagocytosis was reduced by 35% in the cells treated with BAY (mean DMSO 30.2% vs. BAY 10 mM 19.9% or BAY 1 mM 19.4%, n = 7). The partial inhibition of phagocytosis through CD13 was not a result of incomplete Syk inhibition, as phagocytosis through FcgRI was abolished completely at both BAY concentrations used ( Fig. 5B ; mean DMSO 35.6% vs. BAY 10 mM 2.2% or BAY 1 mM 3.3%, n = 7). Thus, activation of Syk contributes to, but is not essential for, CD13-mediated phagocytosis. This result suggests that CD13-mediated phagocytosis is likely to involve different early signaling pathways, one that is Syk dependent and another Syk independent. Next, we determined whether cross-linking of CD13 induces Syk phosphorylation. hMDMs were stimulated by aggregation of CD13 or FcgRI for 45 seconds at 37\u00b0C. pSyk (pY348) was analyzed by flow cytometry, and a representative contour plot is shown in Fig. 5C . Phosphorylation of Syk, following CD13 aggregation, was statistically different from nonstimulated cells (secondary Fabs only) and also from cells stimulated by FcgRI aggregation for 45 seconds (Fig. 5D ; n = 5). Interestingly, we observed that CD13 aggregation induces stronger Syk phosphorylation than FcgRI aggregation when analyzed shortly after ligation (45 seconds), suggesting that pSyk-induced by CD13 or FcgRI cross-linking follows different kinetics. Indeed, in preliminary experiments to determine the optimal time-point to measure Syk activation after CD13 cross-linking, we found that CD13 aggregation induces a rapid phosphorylation of Syk that peaks at 40 seconds and starts to drop soon after. In contrast, FcgRI-induced phosphorylation of Syk peaks after 60 seconds of receptor aggregation, and the phosphorylation is maintained for several minutes [42] . Together, these data indicate that CD13 aggregation induces phosphorylation of Syk and that CD13-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages is partially dependent on Syk activation.",

            "text": "It has been reported that MAPK activation and intracellular Ca 2+ rise, induced by CD13 aggregation, are inhibited by PI3K inhibitors [24] , suggesting that CD13 aggregation induces PI3K activation. During FcgR-mediated phagocytosis, PI3K activation lies downstream of Syk, and its activation is essential for phagocytosis. As we observed that CD13-mediated phagocytosis is partially dependent on Syk and that CD13 cross-linking induces Syk activation, we next examined the requirement of PI3K during CD13-mediated phagocytosis. THP-1 cells or hMDMs were preincubated with the PI3K inhibitor LY, and phagocytosis was measured. Treatment of cells with LY resulted in a strong impairment of CD13-mediated phagocytosis in hMDMs ( Fig. 5E ; mean DMSO 27.4% vs. LY 7.1%, n = 5) and in THP-1 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2B ; mean DMSO 25.3% vs. LY 5.6%, n = 9). As reported extensively, phagocytosis through FcgRI was inhibited completely in the presence of LY, both in human macrophages ( Fig. 5E ; mean DMSO 31.6% vs. LY 6.6%) and in THP-1 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2B ; mean DMSO 29.3% vs. LY 2.7%). These data suggest that PI3K is involved in CD13mediated phagocytosis.",

            "text": "There are several well-characterized mAb against CD13, with varying effects on enzymatic activity and epitope specificity. Among the panel of different antibodies against CD13, mAb WM-15 binds to the active site of CD13 and has been reported to be the best inhibitor of its enzymatic activity [18, 43] . In contrast, mAb452 has a small but significant effect on enzymatic activity and has been shown to bind to a different epitope form that recognized by the mAb WM-15 [18] . A third anti-CD13 mAb (mAb C) was developed in our laboratory and binds to an epitope distinct from the one recognized by mAb452 but partially overlapping the epitope recognized by mAb WM-15 (data not shown). The effect of this antibody on CD13 enzymatic activity was previously unknown. We used these 3 different anti-CD13 antibodies and measured their ability to mediate phagocytosis. We found that the 3 different anti-CD13 antibodies were capable of inducing phagocytosis to a similar extent ( Fig. 6A ; mean Fab452 32.0%, mean Fab C 29.8%, mean WM-15 26.04%, n = 7). Although CD13-mediated phagocytosis of cells treated with WM-15 seems to be somewhat lower, we found no statistically significant difference from the phagocytosis of cells treated with Fab452. Of note, the 3 anti-CD13 antibodies showed similar levels of binding (Fig. 6B) . These results suggest that the epitope recognized by the individual anti-CD13 mAb is not important for CD13-mediated phagocytosis to occur. The same phenomenon has been described for CD13-mediated adhesion, where CD13 cross-linking by different anti-CD13 mAbs (452, WM-15, Y2-K, or WM-4.7) resulted in CD13-mediated adhesion, but none of them was able to induce adhesion when only Fabs, without secondary antibody, were used [19] . These data suggest that cross-linking of CD13 rather than the specific epitope recognized by a particular mAb, is the determinant factor during CD13-mediated adhesion and phagocytosis.",

As control for the enzymatic activity determinations, we used bestatin, a well-characterized chemical inhibitor of aminopeptidase activity, which preferentially targets CD13. As shown in Fig. 6C , bestatin inhibited CD13 enzymatic activity in a dosedependent manner. In line with previous reports, treatment of cells with Fab452 resulted in a small, yet statistically significant enzymatic activity inhibition of 20% (mean Fab452 79.3%, n = 6), and treatment of cells with WM-15 inhibited CD13 enzymatic activity by 40% (mean WM-15 59.9%, n = 6). Treatment of cells with Fab C significantly inhibited CD13 enzymatic activity by 30% (mean FabC 67.1%, n = 6). As expected, treatment with Fab32.2 or IgG1 had no effect on enzymatic activity relative to control cells (mean Fab32.2 94.6%, mean IgG1 97.0%, n = 6). This experiment shows that the different anti-CD13 antibodies inhibit enzymatic activity to different extents, and this difference might be related to their binding to different epitopes, as suggested previously [18, 43] .",

To further confirm the role of CD13 as a primary phagocytic receptor, we expressed CD13 in the epithelial cell line HEK293. These cells lack the expression of most phagocytic receptors and CD13. With the use of a lentiviral delivery system, we infected HEK293 cells with a vector to express hCD13 and RFP under separate promoters. As control, we excised hCD13 from the vector, leaving only the RFP construct. After selection and cloning, we obtained clones with high (clone A6) and medium (clone A4) hCD13 expression (Fig. 7A) . Cells infected with RFP virus (clone M6) did not express hCD13 (Fig. 7A) . As HEK293 cells grow as monolayers that attach to the plastic surface, and we noted that repeated washing disrupts the monolayers and affects cell viability, we modified the construction of phagocytic preys so that they carried the specific Fab [Fab anti-CD13 (EFab452) or Fab anti-FcgRI (EFab32.2) or no Fab (Ec; Supplemental Fig. 3) ]. With the use of this modified construction of the phagocytic prey, the cell monolayer is not subjected to repeated washing steps before incubation with the particles. We verified phagocytosis of these modified phagocytic preys in THP-1 cells by cytometry ( Fig. 7B ; n = 4) and confocal microscopy (not shown), obtaining similar results to those found with the use of the original construction of phagocytic preys. HEK293 hCD13 high (A6) and HEK293 hCD13 med (A4) clones are capable of internalizing Fab452-opsonized but not Fab32.2-opsonized phagocytic preys ( Fig. 7C ; n = 5). HEK293 hCD13 neg (M6) cells did not internalize any phagocytic prey. It is interesting to note that the extent of internalization of phagocytic preys correlated with the level of hCD13 expression, as HEK293 hCD13 high cells (A6) are more competent internalizing erythrocytes (28%) than HEK293 hCD13 med (A4;15%). Cytometry results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7D , we observed internalized erythrocytes in A6 cells only when they were opsonized with Fab anti-CD13 (lower left panels) but no internalization when erythrocytes were opsonized with anti-FcgRI (lower right panels). The upper panels in Fig. 7D show the same conditions for M6 cells. Importantly, this experiment allowed us to rule out the contribution of FcgRs and other major phagocytic receptors in phagocytosis mediated by CD13, as HEK293 cells lack expression of FcgRs, CR3 [44] [45] [46] , and most scavenger receptors [47, 48] . These results further support the role of CD13 as a receptor capable of inducing internalization, independently of other phagocytic receptors. Altogether, these data provide strong evidence that CD13 aggregation by interaction with particles mediates phagocytosis and that CD13-mediated phagocytosis is independent of FcgRs.",

ROS generation has been implicated in a variety of physiologic responses and is a critical component of the antimicrobial repertoire of macrophages. Therefore, we investigated if CD13 aggregation results in production of ROS. To do so, we generated murine macrophage-like J774 cells expressing hCD13 by use of the system described above for HEK293 cells. As J774 cells express murine CD13 [49] and murine FcgRs, we first verified that the Fabs used for the phagocytosis assay did not bind to murine cells. Neither the Fab452 nor the Fab32.2 recognized molecules on the murine cells. After lentiviral infection, we obtained a stable cell line (R3) expressing high levels of hCD13 and a control cell line (M3) with no hCD13 expression (Fig. 8A) . In these cells, we measured the internalization of phagocytic preys opsonized with Fab anti-CD13 (EFab452) and Fab anti-FcgRI (EFab32.2) or without specific Fab (Ec). Whereas a high percentage of R3 cells phagocytosed EFab452 (26.5%), they were unable to phagocytose EFab32.2 or Ec, as expected (Fig. 8B ). M3 cells were unable to phagocytose any particle tested. R3 cells internalize erythrocytes very efficiently (Fig. 8C ) compared with internalization by hCD13 high HEK293 cells (Fig. 7D) , which might be explained by the fact that whereas J774 are professional phagocytes, HEK293 cells are not so.",

We found that treatment with Fab anti-CD13 plus secondary F(ab)9 2 induces ROS in R3 but not in M3 cells ( Fig. 8D ; n = 5).

In the present work, we provide strong evidence that CD13 can act as a primary phagocytic receptor even in the absence of other major phagocytic receptors. CD13-mediated phagocytosis depends on actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and on PI3K activity and is only partially dependent on Syk activity.

            "text": "The natural ligand(s) of CD13, capable of inducing its aggregation and the phagocytosis of large particles in vivo, are currently unknown. Both exogenous and endogenous polyvalent ligands for CD13 have been identified. Human CMV [17, 57] and an important subgroup of coronaviruses [15, 58] , including the HCoV-229E [52] , are exogenous polyvalent ligands for CD13 identified to date. The binding of HCoV-229E to human fibroblasts results in CD13 clustering, and more importantly, CD13 aggregation induced by HCoV-229E mirrors the consequences of antibody-induced CD13 aggregation regarding adhesion [19] and CD13 distribution on the cell membrane [25] . As for endogenous ligands, several lines of evidence suggest that galectin-3 might constitute an endogenous ligand for CD13. Yang et al. [59] used a human cDNA phage display biopanning method to identify proteins interacting with CD13 and found that 70% of the isolated clones encoded galectin-3, which suggests that galectin-3 is a likely endogenous ligand of CD13. Furthermore, in a study that uses affinity chromatography to identify ligands of galectin-3 in seminal fluid, CD13 was found to be 1 of the 9 proteins identified [60] . Moreover, galectin-3 coimmunoprecipitates with CD13 in resting U-937 cells [61] , and CD13 and galectin-3 colocalize in HUVECs after addition of exogenous galectin-3 [59] . All of these data suggest that galectin-3 is an endogenous ligand of CD13 in vivo. Galectin-3 is a b-galactosidebinding lectin, constitutively expressed and secreted by various cell types, including macrophages [62] . Galectin-3 expression is highly up-regulated during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation [63] and during various infectious processes [64] [65] [66] , and galectin-3 is present in considerable amounts in the extracellular space at inflammatory sites [62, 65] . Extracellular galectin-3 can function in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to mediate cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions [67, 68] and monocyte and macrophage migration [69] and promotes cellular responses, such as respiratory burst [63, 70] and phagocytosis [65, 71, 72] . Importantly, galectin-3 binds to surface glycans of bacteria [73, 74] , protista [75, 76] , fungi [77, 78] , and parasites [72] . Thus, the potential role of galectin-3 as a pattern recognition receptor has become an area of intense attention. Galectin-3 can oligomerize, forming multivalent molecules capable of interacting with several ligands at a time and of cross-linking cell-surface glycoproteins [79] . Therefore, it is enticing to propose that galectin-3 might be functioning as an opsonin mediating the interaction of pathogens with CD13 and phagocytosis in vivo. In a recent paper, a role for galectin-3 as an opsonin enhancing the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages has been proposed [71] , raising the possibility that the galectin-3-CD13 pair is functional in pathogenic and stressful settings. Further studies are needed to determine whether galectin-3 can act as an opsonin to promote CD13-mediated phagocytosis in vivo.",

This finding suggests that Syk might be activated by aggregation of CD13. Indeed, we were able to show that in hMDMs, cross-linking of CD13 with antibodies results in a rapid phosphorylation of Syk that peaks at 45 seconds and decreases rapidly. This fast phosphorylation/dephosphorylation kinetics could account for differences between these results and our previous studies, where we were unable to detect pSyk from 3 to 20 minutes after CD13 cross-linking in U-937 cells, assayed by immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting. Possibly, our inability to detect pSyk in our previous studies was related to Figure 8 . hCD13 expressed on murine macrophagelike cells is able to mediate phagocytosis and for ROS production.

            "text": "How Syk is activated after CD13 aggregation is currently unclear, as the short cytoplasmic tail of CD13 does not have a classic ITAM motif. However, it was recently shown that in the U-937 monocytic cell line, CD13 cross-linking by antibodies induced phosphorylation of several proteins, including FAK, ERK, and remarkably, the phosphorylation of CD13 on its cytoplasmic tail in a Src-dependent manner. The pharmacological inhibition of Src-, ERK-, or FAK-abrogated, CD13-dependent adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD13 was found to be essential for Src, ERK, and FAK activation and for CD13mediated adhesion [20] . This study identified the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic part of CD13 as a crucial event in CD13-mediated intracellular signaling, and it is possible that this phosphorylation event is in some way related to the activation of Syk observed by us after CD13 aggregation. This same study reported that anti-CD13 antibody-induced adhesion does not depend on Syk activation, as treatment of U-937 with piceatannol (10 mM) did not impair adhesion [20] . These results are in agreement with our results that use the Syk inhibitor, BAY, where we found that CD13-mediated phagocytosis is impaired but able to proceed in the absence of Syk activation. The partial effect of Syk inhibition by BAY on CD13-mediated phagocytosis could suggest that other kinases, not inhibited by BAY but inhibited by piceatannol, participate along with Syk in CD13mediated phagocytosis. The identity of the other kinases involved in CD13-mediated phagocytosis is currently unknown. However, given that CD13 aggregation recruits and activates FAK [20] , it seems plausible that FAK might be responsible for PI3K recruitment and activation during CD13-mediated phagocytosis, as has been observed in signaling by CR3 and other integrins.",

It has been shown previously that CD13 crosslinking by antibodies induces actin rearrangements leading to adhesion [19, 20] . FcgR-and CR3-mediated phagocytosis are accompanied by the local recruitment of a-actinin [80] , a protein that can bundle actin filaments. In this way, a-actinin links the force generated by the actin network to the bound particle. In this regard, CD13 aggregation by antibodies leads to recruitment of a-actinin, linking membrane-bound CD13 to cytoskeleton [20] . Therefore, we propose that during phagocytosis through CD13, particle-induced CD13 cross-linking induces actin rearrangements and recruitment of a-actinin to link the CD13-bound particle to the cytoskeleton.",

Although much remains to be defined, we found that CD13-mediated phagocytosis involves activation of Syk as well as other initiating kinases, PI3K, and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. As the signaling pathways involved in CD13-mediated phagocytosis coincide with the signaling pathways of most phagocytic receptors, it is plausible that in vivo CD13-induced signals can synergize in vivo with those activated by other phagocytic receptors, as reported previously in in vitro systems [33, 34] .",

            "text": "Our present work provides compelling evidence that CD13 is a primary phagocytic receptor, fully capable of inducing phagocytosis independently of other receptors. We demonstrated that the expression of CD13 on nonphagocytic HEK293 cells is sufficient to enable them to phagocytose through CD13. Moreover, as these cells do not express FcgRs (nor most phagocytic receptors), these data further support the notion that CD13 is a bona fide phagocytic receptor. It has been shown that CD13 and FcgRI coredistribute on the cell membrane after the cross-linking of either one of them in monocytes and macrophages [34] . Therefore, one concerning possibility existed: that particle-induced CD13 aggregation during phagocytosis would also aggregate FcgRI, and the observed CD13-mediated internalization of particles resulted from the signaling triggered by aggregation of FcgRI, making CD13-induced phagocytosis dependent on FcgRI. As HEK293 cells do not express FcgRs, it is clear that CD13 does not depend on FcgRI to mediate phagocytosis, as HEK293 cells expressing hCD13 internalize erythrocytes through CD13 very efficiently. These data show that CD13 is a primary phagocytic receptor, capable of acting independently of other phagocytic receptors. However, it is extremely difficult to rule out completely the possibility that other unknown cosignaling molecules expressed on HEK293 can be participating in CD13-mediated phagocytosis. Under physiologic conditions, several types of receptors are activated in parallel, and multiple signaling cascades are triggered concomitantly. Hence, it is possible that in more natural settings, where CD13 is expressed on the cell membrane along with other phagocytic receptors sharing common signaling pathways with CD13, phagocytosis, through CD13, might be regulated by other receptors engaged by the phagocytic prey, just like we have shown that CD13 modulates phagocytosis by other receptors [33, 34] . CD13-deficient THP-1 cells or bone marrowderived macrophages from CD13-deficient mice [35] showed no alteration in phagocytosis through FcgRs, demonstrating that although CD13 aggregation enhances phagocytosis through FcgRs, this phagocytosis is not dependent on CD13. Likewise, phagocytosis through CD13 is not dependent on FcgRI, although it might be enhanced by the coaggregation of FcgRI.",
