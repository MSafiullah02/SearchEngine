Our model links an underlying Susceptible Infectious Removed (SIR) model of disease dynamics to observed deaths via a time-to-death distribution informed by previous studies. This allows us to actually fit a statistical model to the data, unlike many epidemiological studies in which the SIR model parameters are simply \"calibrated\" to obtain outputs that look similar to the real data. The main outputs of our model are estimates of the number of infections currently, as well as forecasts of the number of infections and deaths under various scenarios for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. All of our outputs have attached Bayesian credible intervals. An important conclusion is that the confirmed case counts greatly underestimate the total number of infected individuals.",

In the United States, there is a severe shortage of SARS-CoV-2 tests, and so even people in hospital with obvious symptoms of Covid-19 are rarely tested. Furthermore, it is by now well-understood that many, perhaps most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild or no symptoms. The combination of these factors means that only a small fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 cases are ever confirmed by a positive test. Because the widely-reported case counts are based only on the number of positive tests, official case counts cannot possibly reflect the true number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Indeed, the confirmed case counts may more accurately represent the distribution of tests than the prevalence of infections.",

Knowledge of the true number of affected individuals could also help with public adoption of containment or mitigation measures, which may seem an overreaction when the only publicly available numbers make it appear that the disease affects relatively few.

This allows us to give estimates of uncertainty in parameters such as the number of infected individuals. The sampling model for the daily number of deaths uses a model of disease progression conditional on the past time series of new infections. The parameters defining the disease progression model are fixed and based on existing clinical data. The underlying process generating the time series of new infections is the SIR model, the parameters of which are estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

This is conceptually similar to our approach in that the model ignores case counts and is fitted only to death information.

In this model, infected individuals are considered contagious. This model is nearly identical to the classic SIR model with the exception that \u03b3I t\u00b41 in the canonical model has been replaced by \u03b3 r pI t\u00b41\u00b4Dt\u00b41 q`D t\u00b41 in our specification. In our evolution model, the expected number of individuals who move from state I to state R is explicitly decomposed into the number who died (which is an integer count that comes directly from our observed data) and the expected number who recover each day, \u03b3 r pI t\u00b41D t\u00b41 q. The logic behind the latter term is that pI t\u00b41\u00b4Dt\u00b41 q is the number of people who were infected as of time t\u00b41 who did not die during that time period. Of those, we expect \u03b3 r to recover per unit time, so in our model \u03b3 r is the rate of recovery for those who will eventually recover. Thus, the mean time between infection and \"recovery\" (the end of the contagious period) for those who do recover is given by \u03b3\u00b41 r , and R 0 is approximately given by \u03b2\u03b3\u00b41 r . These equivalences are approximate in our case, since our compartmental model is discrete-time rather than continuous-time, and we explicitly split the removed population between deceased and recovered. Figure 1 shows one realization of our modified SIR model. The top panel shows one draw of the daily number of deaths. Notice that this is not a smooth curve. When fitting our model, these Ds will be our data, and will be the only thing we observe directly. The other panels are what we will infer from the Ds. The middle panel of the figure shows the \u03bds, the number of daily new infections. The series of Ds has roughly the same shape as the \u03bds, though it lags it by about 25 days. This lag is due to how we have set \u03b8, the parameter governing the time-to-death distribution which we describe below.

Although this statistic focuses on confirmed cases, this number may be reasonably close to the true infection fatality rate because South Korea has aggressively tested and traced contacts, including testing of asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, South Korea's epidemic is relatively old, giving sufficient time that many of the infected individuals who will go on to die have already done so. Keep in mind that computing an infection fatality rate in this way-by dividing total deaths at time t by total cases that have been identified up to time t-would give an underestimate of the infection fatality rate because the denominator includes some people who are currently infected who will eventually die. To give some estimate of how much of an underestimate this may be, South Korea as of 25 March reports 59 patients in serious or critical condition. If 1/4 of these patients die, then the empirical case fatality rate would rise to 1.6%. On the other hand, despite the very high level of testing in South Korea (as of 25 March, they had performed about 7 tests per 1000 population), the number of reported cases is still an underestimate of the total number of cases.",

If this is true, then the raw IFR from Germany's data could be an under-estimate if this effect is enough to offset the infections that have gone undetected despite the aggressive testing taking place. In both the comparison to Germany and South Korea, differences in underlying demographics, comorbities, and other risk factors could limit the applicability of these estimates to the United States. However, such factors are difficult to adjust for, since data on risk factors is preliminary and limited. We believe that the comparison is still useful in providing a rough ballpark estimate.",

The left panel of Figure 9 shows the posterior distribution of the number of newly infected individuals on March 18, and the right panel shows the total number of infected plus recovered individuals on 18 March. We focus on an estimate of the number of infections on March 18, because this is roughly the time at which social distancing measures began in earnest in the United States. For example, California put into place statewide social distancing measures on 19 March. Because we fit our model to only deaths through March 28, and very few individuals die within 10 days of infection, we do not expect that social distancing has had much effect yet on our estimates. However, it does affect the interpretation of our estimates. The deaths being observed today are of individuals infected several weeks ago, at a time when few social distancing measures were in place and the virus was spreading essentially unchecked in the United States. Thus, our estimates of R 0 reflect the transmissibility of the virus without social distancing in place. Once social distancing measures took effect, we expect that the R 0 would decline. We study several cases for how social distancing has changed R 0 in the next section.",

Comparing this to the number of reported cases on 18 March (9,187), we find that the reported case numbers underestimate the total number of infected by a factor of about 50. Of course, infected individuals take some amount of time to develop symptoms, and thus we would not expect everyone who had ever been infected as of March 18 to have sought or received testing. One study [4] reports the incubation period is about 5 days, and the 90th percentile is about 12.5 days, while another study Lauer et al. [3] reports the median incubation period is about 5.1 days, the 2.5th percentile about 2.2 days, and the 97.5th percentile about 11.5 days. Thus a better comparison may be between our estimate of the total number of infected on March 18,2020 and the total number of reported cases on 23 March 2020 (43,781) or on 27 March 2020 (85,435), which suggests that the case count underestimates the total number of infected who are \"visible\" to testing by a factor of between 5 and 10. The latter is in line with the recent paper on the undercount in Hubei [5] . Although the extent of under-testing could be very different in the United States and in Hubei, we find it interesting that these estimates correspond and suspect this is because the numbers are linked by the fact that in both places, asymptomatic people were rarely tested.",
