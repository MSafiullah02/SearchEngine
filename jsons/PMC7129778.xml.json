With no precedent, the scientific community was able to identify the causative agent soon after its emergence [2], [3], [4]. Since then, significant advances have been made in understanding this disease and less than 2 years later, vaccine candidates are already under trial [5]. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the severity of the respiratory distress remain(s) unexplained. Indeed, hypotheses are yet to be made to explain the acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory failure observed in the severe cases, while in the presence of a declining viral load.",

Our investigations, and the work of Wong et al., support this hypothesis as we determined the presence of several cytokines and chemokines at high concentrations in the plasma of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS patients [10], [11]. Especially, Th1-type cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and other related cytokine (IL-18) and chemokines (MIG, IP-10 and MCP-1) were found at unusually high levels.

As IFN-\u03b3 seems to play a role in SARS, we set out to compare some effects of IFN-\u03b3 on a number of human lung fibroblast and epithelial cell lines (chosen for their use in numerous publications as models of their primary counterparts) in order to extrapolate how these cell types co-existing in vivo may react to the presence of IFN-\u03b3. For that purpose, identical culture conditions were used for all cell lines. We report here that in substance both cell types were affected similarly, i.e. susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis after IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, though to different degrees; fibroblastic lines required much larger amounts to become sensitive. These observations led us to hypothesize that specific epithelial sensitivity to IFN-\u03b3 may be the basis underlying the development of lung injury in the late phase of SARS.",

Indeed, dose-dependent experiments determined that epithelial cell lines were more susceptible to the effect of IFN-\u03b3 than fibroblast cell lines (data not shown). Two hundred and fifty IU mL\u22121 of IFN- \u03b3 in A549 and BEAS-2B resulted in very significant differences in growth, while 62.5 IU mL\u22121 was sufficient to detect some effects.

The only moderate induction of apoptosis by IFN-\u03b3, in the range of 8\u201310% of the cells, as determined by annexin V/PI and active caspase-8 staining (data not shown), was ruled out as the possible explanation. Cell cycle analysis was on the other hand able to show that, not only was IFN-\u03b3 ultimately able to dose-dependently arrest the cells at the G0/G1 phase (Fig. 1E and F), it could also first delay their progression through the S phase, as shown by the accumulation of cells in that phase. This latter effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 1G). The multiple ability of IFN-\u03b3 to inhibit the cells from progressing through their cycle probably explains the early growth arrest observed in A549.",

Induction of apoptosis was only significant in A549, at 36 and 60 h after addition, and in MRC-5 at 12 h, but concerned at any time less than 30% of the viable cell population (Fig. 3B and D). When IFN-\u03b3 was added to the culture medium, 12 h before the addition of the anti-Fas antibody, a significant enhancement of apoptosis could be observed in all cell types, although at different times and different extents. In BEAS-2B, an enhanced induction of apoptosis was only observable 72 h after addition of IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, this induction was to a lesser degree than in A549, and required the addition of a larger amount of anti-Fas antibody. At the concentration 0.1 \u03bcg mL\u22121, anti-Fas antibody was unsuccessful at inducing apoptosis, even after IFN-\u03b3 pre-treatment (data not shown). In A549, IFN-\u03b3-enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis developed rapidly, as it was already significant by 24 h (Fig. 3B), and successfully, as it extended to the whole monolayer, causing all cells to be dead by 96 h (data not shown). Fibroblasts were also susceptible to the enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis by IFN-\u03b3. Like in BEAS-2B, apoptosis appeared enhanced only 72 h after addition of IFN-\u03b3 in HFL-1 (Fig. 3C). However, in MRC-5 significant enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis was readily observed by 24 h, but declined thereafter to become non-existent by 72 h (Fig. 3D). In this latter cell line, the enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis by IFN-\u03b3 followed accurately the surface Fas expression profile of MRC-5 cells stimulated by IFN-\u03b3.",

A549 cells pre-treated with IFN-\u03b3 were thus co-cultured with a lymphocytic T cell line, Jurkat, which had previously been activated in order to increase the expression of surface FasL (data not shown). Stimulation by IFN-\u03b3 increased the susceptibility of A549 cells to apoptosis induced by contact with Jurkat cells (\nFig. 4). When the ratio of available Jurkat cells to A549 cells was increased 3-fold, however, the number of unstimulated A549 cells undergoing apoptosis did not significantly increase. But it more than doubled when A549 cells had been stimulated by IFN-\u03b3, clearly indicating the role of Fas in the mediation of this induction of apoptosis by cell contact, and the important role played by IFN-\u03b3 in the enhancement of cellular damage.",

In the latter cases, the development of the lung injury has led to respiratory failure and the need for respiratory assistance at an intensive care unit. Respiratory distress has appeared to be the cause of the majority of deaths related to SARS. One of the hypotheses emerging to explain the severity of the lung inflammation and damage is the development of a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, as result of the infection, leading to an unbalanced inflammatory response. Cytokine profiling of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS patients has revealed the presence of large amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3-related cytokine and chemokines in patients\u2019 blood, and the absence of Th2-type cytokines [10]. IFN-\u03b3 is a cytokine secreted mainly, but not only, by activated and cytotoxic T cells, as part of the immune response to eliminate virus-infected cells. Infiltration of immune cells, including lymphocytes, was observed in the lungs of SARS patients [8]. We therefore hypothesized that IFN-\u03b3 may be a major contributor to the ALI, for it is known to cause cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. We used an array of cell lines to study how IFN-\u03b3 could be involved in selective epithelial damage and fibrosis.",

This is in some ways in contradiction to previously available publications. Indeed, Tanaka et al. have reported that they found that human lung fibroblasts were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, by opposition to epithelial cells that are known to be susceptible to Fas cross-linkage [17], [18], [19]. Although we do not know the actual concentration in International Units of bioactive IFN-\u03b3 used by these authors to treat fibroblasts, it seems that the dose of IFN-\u03b3, duration of pre-treatment, time-point for detection, or a combination of these is responsible for this apparent resistance to apoptosis. In our work, fibroblasts (HFL-1) required an exposure to high concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 to observe any enhancement of surface Fas expression and Fas-mediated apoptosis. MRC-5, the second fibroblast cell line used here, was also sensitive to IFN-\u03b3, although for only a limited period. This could be linked to the phenotypic differences between the two cell lines, MRC-5 possessing some characteristics of myofibroblasts [20]. The possibility that fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts protects them from IFN-\u03b3-enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",

Indeed, although these cells naturally express Fas proteins on their surface, the density seems insufficient to lead to a major induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3B). However, when IFN-\u03b3 increased Fas expression by 48 or 72 h (Fig. 2D or E), more than 50% of the cells underwent apoptosis (Fig. 3B). A similar, yet more convincing, observation could be made with MRC-5 cells. These cells could express Fas, but anti-Fas antibody alone was not able to provoke a clear increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3B). When Fas expression was enhanced by IFN-\u03b3, so was apoptosis, by 24 h (Figs. 2I and 3B). When the Fas expression returned to its basal level by 72 h (Fig. 2K), so had apoptosis (Fig. 3B). The presence of a relationship in time thus seems to support the existence of a correlation between the increased density of Fas protein on the cell surface and the sensitivity of the cell to undergo apoptosis mediated by Fas.",

In any way, this does not affect the fact that lung epithelial cells are clearly highly sensitive to IFN-\u03b3, while fibroblasts are remotely affected. IFN-\u03b3 has thus the ability to prime the destruction of the lung epithelium; indeed, in addition it stimulates epithelial cells, like neighboring fibroblasts, to release significant amounts of chemokines that are known to attract the migration of immune cells. Infiltrating lymphocytes were observed in autopsied cases of SARS [8]. It seems thus plausible that the presence of high amounts of IFN-\u03b3, T cell chemoattractants and infiltrating lymphocytes in the lungs may have led to selective alveolar epithelial damage, as part of an innate immune response, in SARS patients.",

MIG, on the other hand, was more readily produced by fibroblasts, although epithelial cells were also sensitive to the IFN-\u03b3 stimulus. This particularity could be the result of the dual effect of IFN-\u03b3 on epithelial cells: while it stimulates the expression of proteins, it also inhibits cell growth. The latter effect would undoubtedly downsize any stimulated increase in protein expression. Overall, the data point towards an increased readiness of epithelial cells to respond to IFN-\u03b3 by the release of chemokines, in comparison to fibroblasts that require larger concentration of the cytokine. Ultimately, the experiments investigating the production of chemokines were designed to determine if IFN-\u03b3 could further contribute to a lung immunopathology by favoring chemoattraction of the necessary actors (i.e. T cells) for immune-mediated cellular damage.",

Indeed, the absence of IFN-\u03b3 resulted in reduced inflammation in various models of lung injury using IFN-\u03b3-knockout mice [22], [23], [24]. Several studies have also suggested that lymphocytes may play a role in pulmonary injury in rodents. For example, T-cell depletion by anti-CD3 antibody treatment has attenuated pulmonary fibrosis and increased survival in mice treated with bleomycin [25]. A recent publication by Glass et al. indicates that, in mice, the SARS-associated coronavirus successfully replicated and induced an increase in various proinflammatory chemokines, in the lungs, including MIG and IP-10 [26]. However, it failed to stimulate the production of cytokines or the infiltration of leukocytes. In this model, no obvious changes in pulmonary function and little signs of lung injury could be observed. Moreover, the focal necrosis and bronchiolar epithelial damage characterized in SARS-associated coronavirus infected B6 mice were not observed in RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes.

            "text": "Although the immune response is thought to contribute significantly to ALI and respiratory distress in SARS patients, it is not clear how a response dominated by Th1-type biological response modifiers may lead to the development of fibrosis. Here we show lung epithelial cells to be more responsive to IFN-\u03b3-induced damage than fibroblasts. Thus, we propose that the Th1-dominant immune-mediated cell death may actually favor the damage of alveolar epithelial cells over the fibroblast layer, leaving the latter relatively intact. In vivo, this would translate into the destruction of the epithelial parenchyma, a basis for the stimulation of repair mechanisms involving fibroblasts, relatively unaffected by the immune response and available for a proliferative response (\nFig. 5). The association of epithelial destruction and fibrosis has been suggested in other situations, and we are currently investigating the possibility that immune-mediated epithelial destruction may directly stimulate proliferation and/or differentiation of fibroblasts [27], [28]. To conclude, these findings are relevant to the understanding of the roles of IFN-\u03b3 and the Fas/FasL system in ALI, in which alveolar epithelial damage occurs primarily. We suggest that IFN-\u03b3 may play an important role in the development of an immune mechanism that will lead to ALI, fibrosis and ARDS in SARS patients.",
