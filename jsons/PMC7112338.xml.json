Viral RNA copies (106) corresponding to the average load found in clinical samples30, 31, 32 were used in each round of infection. Viruses on the apical surfaces of infected tissues were quantified by using qPCR to assess residual viral loads (remaining after 3 wash steps, 4 hours after inoculation) and subsequent virion replication (collected at 24-hour intervals thereafter). There was no reproducibility in the amount of residual virus for each virus type, probably because of tissue properties, washing efficiency, or both rather than the physicochemical characteristics of the virus. In contrast, apical viral release from day 1 onward was reproducible among replicates (Fig 1\n, A), peaking at days 2 to 4 after inoculation and ranging from 107 to 1011 viral RNA copies for RV-B48 and EV-D68, respectively. Overall, replication rates were significantly greater for EV-D68 versus all other viruses, for H3N2 and RV-A49 versus RV-B48 and HCoV-OC43, and for RV-A55 versus RV-B48 (all P < .01). The amount of viral RNA released in the basal chamber was 2- to 4-log lower than virus released apically (Fig 1, B).",

Surprisingly, all respiratory viruses tested were detected constantly over the 28-day culture period. Viral persistence was reported in similar tissue culture systems for a recombinant RSV\u2013green fluorescent protein,33 as well as in calf tracheal organ cultures for bovine RV and influenza A.34 Here we extend these observations and show that 9 single-stranded RNA respiratory viruses with highly diverse biological characteristics systematically produced persistent infections in cultured human respiratory tissues. Persistence could not be explained by major viral changes because HTS of RV-C15, RV-B48, and EV-D68 collected at 16 dpi or later were not significantly different from those isolated in acute infection, either in viral population composition or in the appearance of defective interfering viral particles. On the other hand, transcriptome analysis of host tissues infected with RV-C15 and RV-B48 showed that innate immunity is strongly induced during the acute phase of infection but decreases thereafter and is insufficient to clear the infection. Although all these viruses usually cause self-limited diseases, chronic infections have been documented in immunocompromised populations,27 supporting our observation and confirming that an effective immune response is required for viral clearance.",

First, all viruses, except HCoV-OC43 and RV-B48, affected cilia beating and MCC. RV-B has already been shown to be less cytotoxic and induce less cytokine production (including interferons) in vitro than RV-A and RV-C.20 In our study it also induced less IFN-\u03bb than the other viruses. In addition, HTS of tissues infected with RV-B48 showed significantly fewer changes in gene expression profiles than tissues infected with RV-C15. In particular, processes related to cilia morphogenesis were not affected by RV-B48, supporting the observed absence of perturbation of MCC and cilia beating by this virus. Concerning HCoV-OC43, the absence of effect on tissue was associated with an even weaker induction of cytokines. Among all tested cytokines, only IP-10 and IL-6 were induced, although at significantly lower levels than by all other respiratory viruses. The ability of coronaviruses to remain undetected by innate immune sensors has been unraveled recently.40 Interestingly, for most viruses that affected cilia beating and MCC, a limited number of cells was infected, and the ciliated cell layer was preserved. This observation suggests a paracrine effect, propagated disorganization of cilia beating, or both. It has been shown that infection by HCoV-E229 does not affect tissue integrity in vitro and cilia beating in vivo.41 Cilia dyskinesia was observed, and Wang et al41 suggested that it would affect MCC; however, HCoV-E229 might have a more expanded cell tropism compared with other HCoV species and might thus be more virulent than HCoV-OC43.37\n",

These observations were confirmed with RSV-A (data not shown). Previous studies with RSV-A in air-liquid interface cultures showed no change in cilia beating frequencies at 72 hours after infection, but ciliary dyskinesia was increased.42 However, this finding does not contradict our data because in our case inhibition of cilia beating for this virus started at only 4 dpi. In addition, our RSV-B was produced in tissue directly from a clinical sample, whereas in the study by Smith et al,42 the RSV-A stock was produced in BSC-1 monkey kidney cells and was potentially cell adapted. For RVs, the low number of infected cells and a weak effect on mucosal integrity has already been demonstrated.43, 44, 45 Similarly, in vitro and in vivo RSV infections were also associated with little tissue damage,12 which is an unexpected finding for a virus that is highly pathogenic in vivo. However, it has been previously proposed that RSV pathogenicity in vivo is mainly immune mediated.12 Surprisingly, the RV-C8 strain that was associated with a disseminated human infection26 was not particularly virulent in our model. This result suggests that the in vivo dissemination and virulence is linked to host rather than viral factors.",

In vitro virulence of EV-D68 is particularly striking when compared with that of RVs belonging to the same genus. This difference might account for the frequent complicated diseases observed during EV-D68 infections.5 Different strains of influenza (H3N2, H1N1, or influenza B) are also known to affect tissue integrity, cilia beating, and MCC in mice, rats, pigs, and human subjects.47, 48, 49, 50 In addition, we observed similar induction of LDH release and blockage of MCC with an H1N1 clinical isolate (data not shown). The mechanisms used by EV-D68 and influenza to destroy ciliated cells might differ. In our study EV-D68 toxicity was associated with higher replication but intermediate cytokine induction, whereas for H3N2, it was associated with strong cytokine induction but intermediate replication levels.",

Based on cytokine (Fig 4) and transcriptome (Fig 7) profiles of infected tissues and on published data, several pathways have shown promise as targets for antiviral therapies. For example, inhibitors of the inflammatory I\u03baB kinase,51 nuclear factor \u03baB signaling pathways,52 and biological processes related to protein localization and targeting,53, 54 as well as type III interferon\u2013based therapies (reviewed by Syedbasha and Egli55), have all been reported to exhibit a direct antiviral activity or to counteract virally activated pathways. Based on our data, these molecules represent valuable targets to fight the infection, as well as its subsequent biological consequences and associated symptoms. Other recently characterized broad-spectrum antiviral molecules known to be effective against enveloped and nonenveloped viruses could also be further validated in this system, such as oxysterols, which interfere with the formation of viral replication organelles56 or direct-acting antiviral drugs active in vitro against several types of viruses, such as sialidase-derived compounds57 or polymerase inhibitors.58 Thus this clinically relevant and unique tissue-culture model could be used to test promising compounds for their tissue toxicity and broad-spectrum antiviral activity (either as prevention or treatment). Because the model is applicable to diverse respiratory viruses circulating in the population (including poorly cultivable ones, such as RV-C), these studies will provide valuable and wide-ranging information that might better guide later in vivo models.",
