Anticipating a shortage of health-care providers, in particular anesthesiologists, hospitals around the world did not hesitate to close down their electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-units. In Flanders, a region in Belgium with 6,596,000 inhabitants, 70% of the ECT-units stopped treatments from the start of the pandemic. The remaining have put treatments for older patients residing in nursing homes on hold. Reasons cited are unavailability of anesthesiologists rescheduled to work in intensive care units, shortage of muscle relaxants needed for mechanical ventilation of COVID-patients, and fear of virus transmission through bag-mask-ventilation during the ECT-procedure. Another reason for closing down the ECT-service is that ECT is considered an elective intervention, and that, moreover, \"psychiatry can wait.\" It is not unusual for patients with a psychiatric disorder to experience poor access to health care compared with people without a psychiatric disorder. 1 But, as eloquently argued by Espinoza et al., 2 in this COVID-era, ''ECT is a lifesaving gem,\" an often essential medical procedure that should not be discarded as an elective intervention.",

            "text": "In this challenging time, the need to deliver care for older adults experiencing serious mental illness is higher than ever. ECT not only yields high remission rates in older patients, 3 it is often life-saving in patients refusing food and fluid intake, or those with psychotic depression, catatonia, and suicidality. 4 In considering the implications of COVID-19 for ECT, it is important for psychiatrists to carefully review the treatment needs in consultation with patients and their families. If ECT is stopped, the 6-month relapse rate with continuation pharmacotherapy will mount up to 37%. 5 Relapse rates after discontinuing an ongoing maintenance-ECT (M-ECT) are similar. 6, 7 Moreover, it is of note that, apart from the burden caused by a depressive relapse, in this particular pandemic context, a depressive relapse might make older patients more vulnerable to infectious diseases. It is known that depression is associated with immunological impairments, especially in older adults, 8 and that in stressful situations, mortality from viral respiratory infections is higher. 9 Therefore, when M-ECT is withheld, or the intertreatment interval is lengthened, a close follow-up is of utmost importance. A protocol of using rescue ECT-sessions based on monitoring of psychiatric symptoms through televisits, 10 using validated rating scales, and providing ECT only in case of early signs of relapse, 11 should be considered standard clinical care in these exceptional times. This practice was shown to be feasible in a large trial on flexible M-ECT in older patients. 12 In an attempt to contain the epidemic, the Belgian government issued on April 3th 2020 all day hospitalizations for persons over 65 years of age to be closed temporarily. As a consequence, M-ECT for outpatients was kept to a strict minimum. More specifically, older patients residing in nursing homes could not be treated on an outpatient basis, in order to protect their fellow-patients from infection. On a weekly basis, assessments were performed via telephone consultations with patients and/or care-providers. If possible, a standardized rating scale was used. Furthermore, cases were discussed on a weekly (video) ECT-team meeting. If signs of relapse were emerging, or in case of increasing suicidality, patients were readmitted to apply rescue ECT starting with ECT twice a week. Readmission was organized in a 7-day quarantineregime, with close follow-up of clinical signs and screening for COVID through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.",
