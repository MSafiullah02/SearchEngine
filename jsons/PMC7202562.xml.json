It has been reported that although headache is not one of the Centor criteria,\nit is a commonly looked for symptom of strep throat and is associated with GABHS infection\nin both children and adults (11). Stuffy nose\nand sneezing are the most common symptoms caused by respiratory viruses. Although\nrhinovirus, the most common virus, is not thought to cause fever, Bellei et\nal. (12) reported a 50.5% incidence\nof fever in rhinovirus related cases in their study. This is in agreement with the Mistik\nScore\u2019s fever criterion. The presence of the fever variable in both bacterial and viral\nscores is possible because fever is observed in both kinds of infections. Also, the\ndifference in the temperature levels may explain how fever may be present in both scores.\nExudative tonsillitis is commonly associated with ADV, EBV, and GABHS infection, although\ninfluenza virus, parainfluenza virus or enteroviruses have been reported (13\u201315).
