In the case of endometrial cancer, for example, uterine specimens must be sent for histopathologic examination in patients with post-menopausal metrorrhagia, magnetic resonance imaging must be performed as part of the preoperative assessment, and patients must be treated according to guideline recommendations and preoperative assessment of risk factors [2]. Likewise, patients with ovarian and uterine cancer should be treated in accordance with the recommendations of the National Cancer Institute [3,4]. Alternative approaches, in line with those suggested by Akladios et al. [5,6], can only be contemplated in overstretched hospitals that have restricted access to operating rooms due to the coronavirus crisis. In this respect, it is important to remember that treatment using available resources is better than no treatment in a patient with cancer.",

According to data from China, patients with cancer are four to eight more times likely to die of COVID-19 complications in the 4 weeks following chemotherapy or surgery than those without cancer [1]. Compromised immune systems are also likely to have a role in patients with comorbidities, particularly if they are incubating the virus at the time of surgery. It should be noted, however, that the above findings are based on a small number of patients who mostly had lung cancer and possibly hematologic malignancies. Whatever the case, in the interest of caution, surgery and chemotherapy should be deferred in cancer patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 wherever possible.",

Specific recommendations for anesthesiologists, surgeons, etc. are available on the websites of learned societies (e.g., the SFCO [French Society of Oral Surgery] and the SFAR [French Society of Anesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine]). Intubation is a high-risk procedure and anesthesiologists must be equipped with proper personal protective equipment (PPE), including goggles, a gown, two pairs of gloves, and an FFP2 face mask. Strict use of PPE is also required for surgeons and assistants working in the surgical field. Surgical smoke should be extracted as close to the source as possible, and pneumoperitoneum evacuated in a closed circuit with a filtering system [7]. Some learned societies have also published recommendations on the use of negative-pressure rooms. Nevertheless, current guidance is likely to evolve as our understanding of COVID-19 improves and we therefore recommend regular consultation of the societies\u2019 websites. If a patient\u2019s COVID-19 status is unknown, as it is for the vast majority of patients requiring surgery, facilities should implement the same protective measures as they would for a patient known to be positive. Application of these measures requires time and significantly increases turnover times, reducing even further the number of patients who can be operated on. Finally, it should be recalled that uncertainty about a patient\u2019s COVID-19 status can cause anxiety among health care workers.",

Considering the risk of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic (during the incubation period) transmission, preoperative screening to determine which patients are positive and which are negative would certainly help minimize risks for both patients and health care workers. While deferral of non-essential surgery would protect COVID-19-positive patients from potentially more severe disease, the implementation of protective measures in operating rooms would protect health care workers from viral contamination. Many hospitals now systematically treat all surgical patients as positive unless proven otherwise. Others recommend PCR testing of nasal swab specimens a week before surgery. As PCR has a false-negative rate of around 30%, performance of low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) scan in the 48 h before surgery has been recommended for patients with a negative PCR test. Observation of characteristic COVID-19 lung images could also provide a faster means of detecting COVID-19-positive patients than PCR. Patients scheduled for surgery are also being called in advance to check for symptoms, with follow-up on the day of the operation. This strategy combining PCR testing, LDCT, and checking of symptoms is an interesting option, but its sensitivity remains to be validated.",
