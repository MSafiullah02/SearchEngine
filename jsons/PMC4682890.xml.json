Traditionally, they have been divided into two species (A & B) and over 100 serotypes. In 2006, a number of novel RV strains were identified with significant variation in the viral protein (VP) regions (VP2, VP4) and 5\u2032 non\u2010coding region (5\u2032 NCR); these formed a distinct new species that was designated \u201crhinovirus C\u201d (RV\u2010C) [Arden et al., 2006; Lamson et al., 2006; Arden and Mackay, 2010]. Approximately 60 RV\u2010C types are now recognized based on phylogenetic clustering, and these viruses have been associated with severe acute respiratory infection (ARI), particularly wheezing ARIs, in young children [Lau et al., 2007; Dominguez et al., 2008; Bizzintino et al., 2011] and asthmatics [Lemanske et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2009; Calvo et al., 2010].",

Pneumonia was diagnosed in children with fever, tachypnoea, and respiratory distress where focal or diffuse crackles or decreased vesicular sounds were present on auscultation. Most diagnoses of pneumonia were based on clinical criteria alone, but radiographic findings were used in some. A diagnosis of asthma/episodic viral wheeze (EVW) was made in children in whom discreet episodes of wheeze occurred, often in association with a presumed viral upper respiratory tract infection. Upper respiratory tract infections (including croup) were diagnosed based on symptoms such as coryza, earache, sore throat, and stridor.",

Our cohort was also from a predominantly low income background [Bezerra et al., 2011].

It supports other studies [Mansbach et al., 2008] suggesting that RV might be an important cause of bronchiolitis [Bezerra et al., 2011]. This is also the first study to examine RV seasonality in Brazil. Unlike previous studies in Australia and North America, RV infection appears to occur throughout the year with peaks during the rainy season, a pattern also seen in Trinidad [Matthew et al., 2009]. It may be that the high population density within our cohort results in continual RV transmission throughout the year.",
