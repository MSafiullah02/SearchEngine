However, because during that era the techniques of viral detection were limited to virus isolation, the viral cause could be proven in only about 25% of patients with respiratory infections.7 Improvements in viral detection techniques during the past two decades, including various viral antigen detection methods and particularly the advent of PCR-based assays, have substantially increased the rates of viral detection in clinical specimens.8, 9\n",

However, the clinical presentation of influenza ranges from an asymptomatic infection to severe illness and it therefore overlaps with the common cold.

However, many colds could also be caused by infectious agents yet to be identified. This explanation gained much support after the recent discovery of a new virus in young children with respiratory infections.15 The relative effect of this virus, tentatively named human metapneumovirus, by comparison with other respiratory viruses is still undetermined. Findings of serological studies15 indicate that the virus has been circulating in human beings for at least 50 years, and by the age of 5 years virtually all children in the Netherlands are infected by it.

The viruses are then transported to the posterior nasopharynx by mucociliary action. In the adenoid area, the viruses gain entrance to epithelial cells by binding to specific receptors on the cells. About 90% of rhinovirus serotypes use intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as their receptor.39, 40 Once inside the epithelial cell, the virus starts to replicate rapidly. Progeny viruses can be detected within 8\u201310 h after intranasal inoculation of rhinoviruses.41 The infectious dose of rhinovirus is small,42 and up to 95% of individuals without antibodies against the specific viral serotype are infected after intranasal challenge.43 However, for reasons still unknown, all infections do not lead to clinical illness; symptomatic colds develop in only 75% of infected persons.43 The shedding of rhinoviruses peaks on the second day after intranasal inoculation and decreases rapidly thereafter, but small amounts of viruses can be discovered in nasal secretions for up to 3 weeks after infection.37, 44\n",

Cholinergic stimulation leads to increased mucous gland secretion and sneezing. The detailed mechanisms by which viral infection causes such changes in the nasal mucosa are still incompletely understood. Distinct differences exist in the degree of epithelial destruction between various respiratory viruses. Whereas influenza viruses and adenoviruses cause extensive damage to the respiratory epithelium,45, 46 no histopathological changes are observed in nasal biopsy specimens from individuals infected with rhinoviruses.37 The absence of epithelial destruction during rhinovirus infections has led to the idea that the clinical symptoms of the common cold might not be caused by a direct cytopathic effect of the viruses, but instead are primarily caused by the inflammatory response of the host. Extensive research into the role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of the common cold has produced evidence for increased concentrations of several mediators, such as kinins, leukotrienes, histamine, interleukins 1, 6, and 8, tumour necrosis factor, and RANTES (regulated by activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in the nasal secretions of patients with colds.47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 The concentrations of interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 in nasal secretions correlate with the severity of the symptoms.53, 54 The host response mechanisms triggered by viral infection are, however, interrelated, extremely complex, and far from resolved. For example, in respiratory epithelial cells infected with RSV, interleukin 1 \u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 induce the synthesis of interleukin 8 at 24 h, but partly inhibit the synthesis of this cytokine at 48 h.55\n",

CT scans and plain radiographs of sinuses obtained during the early course of illness in adults with colds show substantial abnormalities that usually resolve spontaneously without antibiotic treatment.56, 57 These findings imply that most sinus abnormalities observed during the common cold are not evidence of a bacterial complication, but are instead part of the normal course of illness. Findings of an experimental study58 showed that blowing of the nose creates such a high intranasal pressure that it could propel fluid from the nasal cavity to the paranasal sinuses. Furthermore, rhinovirus RNA has been detected in sinus aspirates even in the absence of bacteria,59 and results of a study60 that used in-situ hybridisation provide evidence for the presence of rhinovirus in the epithelial cells of maxillary sinuses in patients with acute sinusitis.",

In a study86 of adult patients with asthma, symptoms of the common cold were reported in 80% of episodes of wheezing or dyspnoea, and rhinoviruses accounted for about 60% of those asthma exacerbations for which the viral cause could be identified. The central role of rhinoviruses in triggering acute exacerbations of asthma has also been well documented in children.87 In the elderly population, the overall morbidity due to respiratory viruses other than influenza is often under-rated, although results of surveillance studies13 indicate that two thirds of elderly patients with colds can be expected to develop lower respiratory illness. Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) form another important risk group for viral infections.88 Although the frequencies of colds are similar in patients with and without COPD, the use of medical resources, including hospital admissions and visits to emergency clinics, during viral respiratory illnesses is substantially increased in patients with COPD.89 In immunocompromised patients, RSV is usually the most common cause of severe viral respiratory illness, but rhinovirus infections have also been associated with severe and even fatal lower respiratory tract disease.90\n",

Diagnosis in infants is especially difficult in cases in which fever is the leading symptom during the early phase of the infection, and the doctor is challenged to distinguish benign viral infections from severe invasive bacterial infections. Allergic or vasomotor rhinitis can sometimes mimic the common cold, but usually these conditions can be differentiated easily. The soreness of the throat caused by streptococcal pharyngitis often resembles the initial symptoms of the common cold. However, nasal stuffiness and discharge, which are the primary symptoms of the common cold, are untypical to streptococcal pharyngitis. Although most cases of exudative tonsillitis in children are caused by viruses, the clinical findings on inspection of the pharynx cannot reliably distinguish bacterial from viral tonsillitis.91 In children, intranasal foreign bodies should be searched for in cases of persistent nasal discharge, particularly if the discharge is unilateral.",

Recently developed rapid antigen detection kits for influenza and RSV can provide results within 15\u201330 min,98, 99 but there are concerns about the real-life sensitivity and specificity of these tests.100 PCR has proved valuable in diagnosis of viral infections in general, and especially rhinovirus infections, for which other methods have been suboptimum.8, 9, 101, 102 However, PCR-based techniques are still too laborious for use in everyday clinical practice, and the extreme sensitivity of PCR can pose problems for the interpretation of results.19, 20\n",
