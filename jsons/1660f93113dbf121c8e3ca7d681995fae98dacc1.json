Charlson comorbidity index [S1] was used for the evaluation of comorbidity burden. CURB-65 score was calculated for estimation of disease severity on admission [S2] . Additionally, the SOAR pneumoniae score was also calculated to avert an overestimation of disease severity in dialysis patients or kidney transplant recipients with suboptimal kidney function [S3] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as the onset of respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary consolidation and severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio \u2264300 mmHg with positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure \u2265 5 cm H2O) in the absence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema [S4] .
