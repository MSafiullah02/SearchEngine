            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life threatening despite the advent of potent antibiotics. Up to 36% of hospitalized CAP patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). These patients present with more severe disease, more morbidities, and higher mortality rate [1]. Thus outcome evaluation is important for management of patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission. Practice guidelines based on severity-assessment tools, such as the CURB-65 score, allow high-risk patients to be identified and given specific treatment [2]. However, the prediction rule is derived from clinical data and laboratorial parameters, which are more time-consuming and difficult to obtain, thereby limiting the clinical applications of predictive outcomes. Several biomarkers have been proposed to assess illness severity and outcome. For example, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 [3] and D-dimer [4] are associated with 30-day mortality and major morbidity in patients with CAP. Procalcitonin [5-7], albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels [8,9] have also been shown to predict the severity of illness and 28-day mortality. However, most of these factors merely reflect individual coagulation and inflammation status, but have no therapeutic potential in themselves. Therefore, identification of a new biomarker, capable not only of predicting outcomes but also of providing a potential therapeutic target, would be more useful in clinical applications.",

            "text": "Kallistatin, an endogenous human serine proteinase inhibitor, was originally known as a tissue kallikrein inhibitor. It binds strongly to tissue kallikrein and is able to inhibit tissue kallikrein kininogenase and amidolytic activities in vitro [10,11]. However, kallistatin has been reported to have various effects as an antiangiogenic, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antiinflammatory agent, independent of kallikrein inhibition [12-14]. A significantly reduced kallistatin level was seen in plasma samples from patients with liver disease and with sepsis, suggesting that kallistatin is produced mostly in the liver and can be consumed during sepsis. Its consumption in sepsis may indicate a protective role to prevent blood pressure reduction [10]. In an animal study, transgenic mice overexpressing rat kallikrein-binding protein, sharing a high degree of sequence identity with human kallistatin, were more resistant to LPS-induced lethality [15]. Studies investigating adenovirus-mediated kallistatin gene therapy in rat models of collagen-induced arthritis and osteoarthritis also showed that kallistatin suppresses arthritis progression through its antiangiogenesis, antiinflammation, and antiapoptosis activities [16,17]. In addition, previous studies demonstrated that kallistatin inhibits inflammatory cell infiltration and oxidative stress in animal models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, and salt-induced renal injury [13,14,18]. In the carbon tetrachloride-induced liver-injury mouse model, transgenic expression of kallistatin was shown to attenuate liver damage through reduction of oxidative stress [19]. These findings indicate that kallistatin has protective effects against vascular and organ damage by preventing inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Given that kallistatin can be found in a wide range of human tissues and fluids, including kidney, lung, myocardium, blood vessels, plasma, and urine [10,20], its plasma levels might be relevant to infectious diseases, which commonly induce multiple organ dysfunction and lead to death. To our knowledge, clinical studies investigating the association of plasma kallistatin levels with human infectious diseases, such as CAP, are still lacking.",

Study approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives if the patients were unconscious. Adult patients with pneumonia that required ICU admission were initially screened for severe CAP. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, immunosuppressive treatment, and tuberculosis. Pneumonia was diagnosed if patients presented with acute lower respiratory tract infection, new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography, and identification of microbes in the lower respiratory tract. Severe CAP was defined according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria [21]. Exclusion criteria were refusal of informed consent, prior hospitalization within 15 days before admission, pneumonia developing during hospitalization, terminal illness receiving palliative treatment, and delayed ICU admission for more than 48 hours. All patients were initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, based on the ATS guideline, as early as possible [21]. Subsequent adjustments of the antimicrobial regimen were based on the antibiotic susceptibilities and the opinions of infectious specialists once causative pathogens were defined. Clinical response of antimicrobial therapies was evaluated daily, and treatments and cultures were reassessed and reexamined in patients who showed a deteriorated condition.",

The variables that showed significant or nearly significant differences (that is, P < 0.2) on univariate analysis were then entered in a multivariate logistic regression model to derive the independent prognostic factors. Spearman correlation-of-rank coefficient was used to analyze correlations between kallistatin and other biomarkers. Furthermore, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier curve were drawn for kallistatin to evaluate the ability to discriminate between patients who survived and those who died. The optimal kallistatin cutoff was defined as the value associated with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity (Youden index). Differences between the Kaplan-Meier curves were assessed by using the log-rank test. A two-sided P value \u2264 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",

In multivariate models, apart from CURB-65 score as an independent predictor (OR = 29.85; 95% CI = 2.36 to 378.25; P = 0.009), the kallistatin levels tended to be associated with death among the other tested factors, with P < 0.2 in univariate analysis (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.01 to 1.06; P = 0.056) (Table 4). Furthermore, we summarized the observed mortality by quartile of day 1 kallistatin levels. In comparison with the overall mortality of 24.1%, a categoric increase in death was observed from 8% in the lowest quartile to 43% in the highest quartile, with a significant test for trend across quartiles (P = 0.018) (Figure 2A). On further analysis of the association between day 1 kallistatin levels and severity of illness, we found a categoric decrease in kallistatin levels with a significant trend test across three categories of CURB-65 score (P = 0.004) (Figure 2B). In addition, to determine the optimal cutoff values of day 1 plasma kallistatin for mortality, ROC curves were also constructed with an area under the curve of 0.683 (P = 0.048) (Figure 3A). Optimum cutoff value of 6.5 \u03bcg/ml was obtained with the sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 54% (Figure 3A). In accordance with the cut-off value determined by the ROC curves for mortality, the 60-day survival rate was further evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. All patients who did not survive in 60-day follow-up were shown to die during hospitalization, and their death was related to severe CAP, based on the medical records. Survival rate in patients with high levels of plasma kallistatin was significantly higher than in groups with low levels (Figure 3B; see also Additional file 1, Figure S1 for a large illustration).",

We also found that kallistatin correlated positively with anticoagulation factors (protein C and antithrombin III) and negatively with inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6), suggesting that both anticoagulation and antiinflammation events may contribute to these physiological and outcome benefits.

A prior study of kallistatin in human sepsis showed significantly reduced plasma kallistatin levels in patients with sepsis compared with healthy individuals, suggesting a protective role of kallistatin in sepsis through regulation of inflammatory processes [10]. In a murine model of endotoxic shock, transgenic mice overexpressing the rat kallikrein-binding protein gene, a functional analogue of kallistatin, were shown to have a higher survival rate than nontransgenic control mice [15]. Our study demonstrated similar results with decreased plasma kallistatin levels at days 1 and 4 of ICU admission in severe CAP patients compared with healthy individuals. Kallikrein is a component of the kallikrein/kinin system, which is known to regulate hemostatic and inflammatory processes and can be consumed during sepsis [26]. However, we found that plasma kallikrein levels were not significantly different between CAP patients and healthy individuals. The discrepancy may be related to the differences in studied populations or reflect the relatively small sample size. Of note, no correlations were found between kallistatin and kallikrein in our study, suggesting that the effects of kallistatin were independent of the kallikrein/kinin system. In addition, lower plasma kallistatin levels were found in patients affected with septic shock and ARDS, suggesting the protective effects of kallistatin against such complications.",

Although we found only a nearly statistical significance in kallistatin to predict mortality independently, we indeed demonstrated that decreased plasma kallistatin levels have a strong trend toward increased mortality and severity. These findings were also confirmed by a Kaplan-Meier survival-curve analysis, which revealed a better survival rate in patients with high kallistatin levels than in those with low levels.",

These findings are supported by other studies that showed markedly lower circulating kallistatin levels in humans with sepsis [10] and with necrotic acute pancreatitis [30], in which the inflammatory response is enhanced, and the anticoagulant response is suppressed [29]. In animal studies, kallistatin gene delivery inhibited inflammation in a rat renal disease model [14], acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury [13], and a rat arthritis model [16], indicating that kallistatin is relevant to an antiinflammatory effect. To the best of our knowledge, no reports illustrate the relation between kallistatin and anticoagulant factors. Although it is well known that the kallikrein/kinin system is involved in regulation of hemostasis via activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, leading to the formation of a fibrin network, the role of this system in induction of pathologic coagulation disorders in severe infectious diseases is still controversial [26]. Another possible reason is that declining circulating antithrombin III and protein C levels caused by increased consumption during illness may simply be a marker for greater severity of illness, as were lower kallistatin levels.",

The major limitations of our study include its small sample size in a single medical center, which may account for some lack of statistical significance. The small patient population also prevented a subgroup analysis to examine further the differences in the effects of kallistatin on clinical outcomes according to some comorbidities. However, the distribution pattern of comorbidities between survivors and nonsurvivors was similar in our cohort. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that different therapeutic interventions may affect the results through unknown interactions with kallistatin. Future studies using more subjects are required to substantiate our findings further and to confirm the potential benefits of kallistatin in severe CAP.",
