For example, the goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2020 is only possible if people are being informed about their illness through voluntary testing and access to healthcare services. In addition, the elimination of stigma and discrimination is one of the key topics that should be addressed when planning for the prevention and control of the disease worldwide.7 Moreover, the socio-economic burdens of NCDs are particularly severe in developing countries, accounting for 75% of all NCD-related deaths. Thus, in order to achieve sustainable development goals, the WHO has established global governance to address complex issues that could not be managed alone. These interactions have raised a range of ethical challenges, including conflicts of interests and governance issues. Transparency, accountability, and management of conflicts of interests are ethical issues requiring attention to prevent NCDs and chronic diseases. Therefore, policy-makers and governments have been working closely with food and drink industry partners to address a number of determinants and processes, which today are tackled by a set of institutions globally. These new challenges call for tools and methods for overcoming ethical conflicts and maximizing benefits.8\n",

            "text": "The American Public Health Association identified 10 essential functions for the effective implementation of PH programs,9 which resulted in the development of a variety of ethical frameworks. Initially, the following two concerns led to the formation of practical frameworks for ethical evaluation of PH: (i) public involvement rather than individual autonomy; and (ii) prioritization and allocation of scarce resources, especially in developing countries, which has raised the debate on justice.10 So far, several practical frameworks have been proposed for the ethical evaluation of PH programs, but none are universally approved.11, 12, 13 Most of these frameworks were based on common underpinning assumptions, but they were formed to address ethical issues either theoretically or practically. Kass11 was the first pioneer who proposed a primary practical framework for ethical evaluation of PH, including six steps, based on two key values of social rights and social justice. Childress et al.14 conceptualized general moral considerations in PH practice and introduced six justificatory conditions to solve conflicts in the context of PH. In the stewardship model proposed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007,15 only practical recommendations for ethical decision-making were mentioned. On the other hand, given the debates raised about priority setting, especially in developing countries, ethical frameworks based on fundamental values of fairness and accountability have been proposed, which combine normative and empirical methods, and the involvement of all stakeholders and partners in policy decisions.16, 17, 18 Thus, to enable legitimate and fair decision-making when considering priority setting in PH policy, the 'accountability for reasonableness'19 framework was created, which was then developed by health system stakeholders in developing countries specifically for their requirements.20, 21, 22 Given the evolution and specialization of these frameworks, Ten Have et al.,12 proposed a practical framework to evaluate overweight and obesity interventions, after providing an inventory of relevant moral norms. At the heart of the framework is a list of eight questions on the morally relevant features of a program, which is then followed by procedural recommendations for applying the ethical framework. Marckmann et al.,13 proposed an ethical framework to guide professionals in planning, conducting, and evaluating PH interventions. Their proposed framework contains an explicit normative foundation with \ufb01ve substantive criteria, five questions on the morally relevant features of a PH program, and seven procedural conditions to guarantee a fair decision-making process. However, the authors did not assess its practical application to determine the efficiency of the framework.",

The group included three men and three women who were recommended by the Vice Chancellor of Iran's National Institute for Health Policy Research.(B)The Delphi method was used to validate the content and determine the components to be used in the framework structure. In the first round, we emailed the list of general moral norms to 20 Iranian experts with expertise in biomedical ethics or PH policy and asked them to determine the relevance and importance of each of the norms by scoring with a 5-point Likert scale (1: very low; 2: low; 3: moderate; 4: high; and 5: very high). Overall, 14 of the 20 experts responded. Based on received comments and scores, the norms that scored \u2264 3 were merged with other norms, and then the median was calculated using a frequency distribution table for each norm. In the second round, the list of revised general moral norms, with median scores resulting from the first round, were emailed to the previous 14 respondents who were then asked to re-score each norm. Analysis of scores on the revised list of moral norms showed that all respondents were in agreement in terms of which components should be used in the structure of a practical framework.(C)After determining and validating the moral norms to be applied as structural components in creating the practical framework, it was further developed in six detailed steps (see the Results section).(D)To assess the efficiency of the framework, Iran's Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control was evaluated by the final users (program experts) of the framework. After obtaining permission from the head of the Center for Communicable Diseases and Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education (who had previous involvement in the project), two group discussion sessions were held with nine experts from the Ministry of Health and its affiliated universities. These experts were specifically chosen by the Director of the HIV/AIDS Control Office. In the first session, which lasted 2 h, after expressing the goals of the meeting and obtaining the oral agreement of participants, they were asked to identify ethical considerations in the form of potential strengths and weaknesses (ethical points) associated with the Fourth Strategic Plan of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control without using the framework. Then, to determine the content validity of the framework, participants were asked to rate the relevance, simplicity, and clarity of the resulting questions using the 5-point Likert scale. After summarizing the responses, the framework was refined and finalized at a meeting with attendance of those experts (content validity index [CVI] = 96.2%). Then, an evaluation session of the program, which lasted 3 h, was conducted using the developed framework and its application guide with nine previous participants, as followings:1.Form an evaluation team, consisting of three ministry experts, three university experts, and three experts working in other relevant PH institutions;2.Specify and balance the list of moral norms in PH policy and practice, in each domain;3.Answer questions in the form of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 by mentioning the potential strengths or weaknesses (ethical points);12\n4.Make recommendations regarding ethical pitfalls based on weaknesses (negative points);5.Evaluate the program by integrating the results from the evaluation of each domain and decision-making as: (i) the program is acceptable; (ii) the program is acceptable with some revisions; or (iii) the program is not acceptable.\n(E)In order to determine the total number of weaknesses and strengths (sum of the positive and negative ethical points) that may be obtained by evaluating Iran's Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control through applying the framework, the program was previously evaluated by three members of the research team. A total number of 50 negative and positive ethical points were elicited, and this was considered the reference point. Finally, to calculate whether there is significant difference between the frequency of provided answers as strengths (the number of positive points) and weaknesses (the number of negative points) before and after applying the framework, the number of ethical points compared with the reference was analyzed using the Mac-Nemar non-parametric test due to the abnormal distribution (confidence interval [CIN] = 99%).\n",

Occasionally, PH interventions are associated with some risks (for example, the existence of a false-positive result in sequential or unnecessary screening tests); therefore, it is necessary to estimate the risks of the program. The more frequent the burdens of a program, the greater the evidence should be for the benefits. An autonomous choice is a decision that is not influenced by the interference of others or restrictions, such as inadequate understanding and awareness.25 But in order to increase the effectiveness, they may be morally accompanied by harmful impacts, such as stigma and discrimination.11 For example, the stigma associated with obesity can cause feelings of worthlessness and loss of will, in addition to lost opportunities, such as employment and access to healthcare services, and ultimately discrimination and inequality, deprivation and undesirable health outcomes.12 \u2018Stigmatization\u2019, \u2018violation of confidentiality\u2019, and \u2018disclosure of information\u2019 are more sensitive to data collection activities.

For example, \u2018contact tracking\u2019 (e.g. for follow-up purposes) poses additional privacy risks because not only the name and condition of the infected person are reported but also their contact details.\nStep 3: Is the program effective (balancing of benefits and burdens to maximize the benefits of the program)?\n",

For example, evidence suggests that the risk of developing measles-induced encephalitis is one per 1000 children, which is reduced to one per 1,000,000 children following vaccination. If there is a risk of an epidemic in a region, vaccination is effective because of the increasing risk of infection.",

Thus, an analysis must take place to investigate whether the program can be adapted to minimize burdens, while maintaining the benefits, or whether there is an alternative intervention or strategy. Therefore, alternative interventions or strategies need to be reviewed. If there are two interventions or strategies to solve a PH problem, assuming that the benefits are not significantly different, it becomes a moral obligation to opt for the strategy with fewer risks of moral issues, such as autonomy and privacy. In general, less enforcement of compulsory measures and consideration of incentives results in less infringement of individual autonomy. For example, if evidence suggests that a voluntary screening program essentially tests the same number of people as a compulsory program, it is not morally necessary to enforce a mandatory program; or, if a disease surveillance system has the same effect using unique identification codes as it does with the national identification codes, it is morally preferable to use identification codes.",

Thus, the evaluation of lifelong improvement programs for both healthy and less healthy/able people is the same.
