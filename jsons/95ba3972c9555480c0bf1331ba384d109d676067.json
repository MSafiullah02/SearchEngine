Methods: The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: All Patients were divided into severe (69) and non-severe group (135). Lymphocyte subsets count, including CD3+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell (CD19+) and NK J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cell (CD16+56+), were significantly lower in severe group (P\uff1c0.001). The dynamic levels of T lymphocytes in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15-day treatment and finally returned to the normal level. The cut-off value of the counts of CD3+ (576), CD4+ (391) and CD8+ (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID-19. Conclusion: Our results shown that the decrease of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases. The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

The mechanism of the reduction of T lymphocytes may be associated with the direct invasion of SRAS-COV-2, which have been confirmed in MERS-CoV 13 and dendritic cell (DC) cells, and SARS-CoV-2 may alter function of APC and impair DC migration, which can reduce priming of T lymphocytes 16, 17 .
