            "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine the differentially expressed genes in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) cultured on titanium (Ti) substrata with topographies presenting microgrooves and acid-etched roughness. Microgrooves were fabricated with a truncated V-shape in cross-section at 15/3.5, 30/10, and 60/10 \u00b5m (width/ depth) by photolithography. Subsequent acid etching was applied to the entire surface of the fabricated Ti substratum to generate etched microgrooves and ridges (designated as E15/3.5, E30/10, and E60/10). Both smooth and acidetched-only Ti were used as controls (designated as NE0 and E0). Large-scale gene expression analyses were performed using differential display PCR, and the results were confirmed using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Of the 21 genes with altered expression determined by differential display PCR and sequencing, we verified through RT-PCR that MTDH and TIMP1 were up-regulated and TGF-\u03b21, TPM1, and VIM were down-regulated in the HGFs cultured on E60/10 versus NE0. We also confirmed, by quantitative real-time PCR, that MTDH and TIMP1 expression in HGFs on E60/10 was significantly up-regulated compared to HGFs on the other Ti substrata. This study indicates that acid-etched ridges and microgrooves on Ti with a width and depth of 60 and 10 \u00b5m (E60/ 10) induce alterations in the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, and regulation of the cytoskeleton in HGFs.",

Specifically, Ti etched microgrooves 60 \u00b5m wide and 10 \u00b5m deep trigger growth and proliferation of MC3T3 mouse preosteoblasts. 5 Ti substrata with this topography also significantly enhance cell adhesion and alkaline phosphatase activity in both human bone marrow stromal cells and human periodontal ligament cells. 6 Large-scale gene expression screening using GeneFishing\u2122 with specific annealing control primers (ACPs) was developed to identify differentially expressed gene (DEGs) transcripts. 7 Differential display PCR is unique because it uses hundreds of arbitrary primers. 8 However, non-specific annealing of the *Tel: +82-2-440-6204; Fax: +82-2-440-7549 e-mail: lsb@khu.ac.kr (Richard Leesungbok) short and longer arbitrary primers is problematic and has resulted in the development of a technique that uses a specific ACP system, which reduces possible false-positive results. 7 Here, using the simple and precise method of differential display PCR, we attempt to identify novel genes that are differentially expressed in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) by topographical stimulation exerted by the combination of microgrooves and acid-etched roughness created on Ti surfaces. Because 60-\u00b5m-wide and 10-\u00b5m-deep etched microgrooves have been verified as a potent promoter of fibroblast adhesion and proliferation, 9 we hypothesized that over time fibroblasts cultured on this surface topography would display differential expression of genes with functions that are closely related to the corresponding cellular activity. We serially confirmed differential display PCR results using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. We established an experimental design that can be used in future research to identify alterations in the expression of genes under specific conditions, including in stem cells in osteogenic culture on Ti substrata with etched microgrooves and ridges. Specifically, this design will allow us to assess whether these substrata can be used for inducing faster and stronger osteoblastogenesis and differentiation compared to smooth Ti.",

The results of induced overexpression of AEG-1 in normal human cells indicates that AEG-1 protects the cells from serum starvation and acts as an anti-apoptotic protein. 16 Because MTDH (AEG-1) gene expression was up-regulated in this study (Table 3 and Fig 4 and 5) , research concerning the expression of this gene in healthy cells, rather than in cancer cells, needs to be performed on biomaterials with various surface topographies. TIMP1 is a secretary protein that functions as a natural inhibitor of metalloproteinase activity to promote the growth and proliferation in many types of cells. 17 Specifically, the exclusive growth promoting activity of TIMP1 compared to other ECM proteins was verified at the S-phase of proliferating HGFs. 18 Serum levels of the TIMP1 protein, in HGFs, regulates expression levels of its own gene, suggesting that a selfregulatory action of TIMP1 exists that precisely controls HGF proliferation. 19 We observed up-regulated expression of TIMP1 mRNA in HGFs cultured on E60/10 (Table 3 and Fig 4 and 6) , and we determined previously that E60/10 significantly enhances HGF proliferation. 4,9 Therefore, we suggest that the microgrooved Ti substrata trigger HGF proliferation by exclusive up-regulation of the TIMP1 gene.",

[4] [5] [6] 9 The DEGs in this study were selected according, primarily, to differential gene expression observed between the HGFs cultured on NE0 versus E60/10, the prime experimental substratum. Therefore, the gene expression results of HGFs on E0, E15/3.5, and E30/10 were not the primary determinants of selecting the DEGs for further evaluation in this study. Performing differential display PCR in the cells cultured only on NE0 and E60/10 may have been more effective than performing this analysis on all five substrata, and this will be taken into consideration for further investigations using differential display PCR with a similar experimental design. Regardless, confirmation of the identified DEGs should be performed on all test substrata using RT-PCR or quantitative PCR. In addition to the genes reviewed here, several other genes that displayed altered expression by differential display PCR should be included in future studies that investigate the function of genes altered by this novel topography. For instance, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (EIF1) mRNA, which accelerates the process of translation initiation, 25 was upregulated and ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) mRNA, which suppresses post-translational protein modification by down-regulating the sumoylation pathway, 26, 27 was down-regulated in this study (Table 3) . These genes might provide additional information about mechanisms involved in the affect of Ti surface microgrooves on the viability of cultured HGFs. The expression patterns and roles of the proteins encoded by the six genes reviewed here need to be further investigated for their roles in cell adhesion, proliferation, and regulation of cytoskeleton. However, the differential display PCR results of this study still provide insight into how etched microgrooves and ridges created on Ti, especially those 60 \u00b5m in width and 10 \u00b5m in depth, promote the cellular events that Table 4 .
