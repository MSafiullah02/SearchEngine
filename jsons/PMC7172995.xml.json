Clinical studies examining patients infected with respiratory viruses have found that RSV, rhinovirus, and adenovirus cause airway obstruction and in some cases cause decreased forced expiratory volume readings.1 Interestingly, this correlation is not present in patients infected with the influenza virus. Additionally, studies in mouse models have shown that although RSV infection causes the production of (TH2) cytokines, as measured on the basis of mRNA, this is not the case for influenza.2 One experimental mouse model examining the role between influenza and allergy has determined that influenza infection can decrease the allergic response, although the mechanism is not clear.3 These studies are supported by clinical investigations that demonstrate that a relatively low number of influenza cases, versus RSV or rhinovirus infections, actually cause exacerbation of asthma and acute bronchiolitis in adults.4, 5, 6\n",

Although none of these studies have come up with a single cytokine or chemokine that can account for the differences in physiologic and immunologic responses that occur on infection, several interesting findings have been published. Although many studies have looked at the production of CCL3 and CCL5 in vitro and in vivo, there is no difference in the level of these ligands found in the airways of patients infected with influenza or RSV.7, 8 However, one report demonstrated that in patients infected with either RSV or influenza, higher levels of CCL3 protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid correlated with hypoxic bronchiolitis, which was not the case for CCL5.8 Another study found that patients infected with RSV have higher serum levels of CCL5, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule, IL-4, IL-5, and IgE than patients infected with influenza.9 This latter study suggests the importance of examining additional compartments for cytokine and chemokine levels and not only the lung when studying respiratory viral infections.",

A comparative study examining the effects of respiratory viruses on CXCL8 production found that although levels of CXCL8 protein in the nasal lavage fluid (NLF) of influenza virus\u2013 and rhinovirus-infected patients correlated with a higher symptom score, this was not the case for RSV-infected patients. Interestingly, in this same study the RSV-infected group had the greatest incidence of wheezing,1 an indicative correlate for the development of asthma. Another group found that influenza infection was associated with higher CXCL8 levels in nasal washes than RSV.10 Additionally, the peak production of CXCL8 is different when comparing infections. In experimental RSV infection of human subjects, there is an initial spike of CXCL8 protein levels in NLF on day 1, with a more significant peak production occurring between days 6 and 14 of infection.11 However, during influenza infection, CXCL8 protein in NLF peaks between days 4 and 6 and is back to baseline by day 7.12 Rhinovirus infection mimics the CXCL8 secretion pattern seen in influenza infection, with the peak production occurring between days 2 and 3 and dropping off by day 5.13 These data clearly demonstrate that the biology between the viruses is different, which might account for some of the differences in inflammation and pathophysiology of the different pathogens.",

Although several chemokines, such as CCL3, CCL5, CCL11, and CXCL8, are consistently found to be produced in cell culture systems upon viral infection, microarray data from RSV-infected epithelial cells suggests that other chemokines might also play a role in the response to viral infection.16 Interestingly, there seems to be some disparity in the chemokines produced during a given viral infection. For example, PBMCs infected with influenza do not produce CXCL8,17, 18, 19, 20 and epithelial cells infected with adenovirus do not produce CCL37 (summarized in\nFig 1).7, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 Chemokines and their receptors might also play a more direct role in the outcome of viral infection than cell recruitment or activation. For example, in vitro CCL5 production has been shown to inhibit binding of RSV to cells.41 Additionally, the RSV G protein was shown to mimic the ligand for CX3CR142 and might inhibit T cells from migrating to the lung during RSV infection.43\n",

            "text": "Murine studies have also yielded conflicting results in regard to the ability of viral infection to enhance subsequent allergic responses. Although some research suggests that RSV infection occurring during the allergen sensitization phase prolongs airway hyperreactivity and increases inflammation and mucus production in the lungs,54 other reports suggest that RSV given before allergen sensitization reduces airway hyperreactivity, eosinophilia, and IL-13 production.55 Another study with repeated RSV infections before and during allergen challenge demonstrated a decrease in mucus-producing cells and alveolitis, although infection did not alter lymphocytic infiltration into the lungs.56 This research suggests that the timing of RSV infection is critical in determining how the immune system responds to subsequent stimuli. If applied clinically, these data could determine which RSV-infected patients receive treatment. Several studies in which mice were infected with RSV and then sensitized to allergen suggest CCL5 might be important in predisposing virally infected mice to more severe allergies. In these studies RSV infection was initiated 21 days before allergen sensitization. In control mice previous RSV infection increased airway hyperreactivity and the level of chemokines in the lungs. Blocking IL-13 during RSV infection reduced the levels of chemokines, as well as airway hyperreactivity, in the lungs of mice that were subsequently sensitized and challenged with allergen.57 When CCL5 was blocked during the course of RSV infection, subsequent allergen sensitization and challenge was reduced to the phenotype of allergen-sensitized uninfected mice. This was correlated to a reduced level of leukotriene production.58 Additionally, the absence of CCR1 in this model caused a reduction in airway hyperreactivity and mucus, which was accompanied by a reduced amount of IL-13 in the lungs, as well as reduced numbers of T cells and eosinophils.59 These studies implicate that CCL5 and other CCR1 ligands might be important in setting up the immune system in the lung to respond inappropriately to allergens after RSV infection.\nFig 3 shows some of the chemokines induced during RSV infection and the cell types on which the receptors for these chemokines are present.",

            "text": "There is a definite link between rhinovirus infection in exacerbation of asthma and increased CXCL8 levels. One report found that CXCL8 levels correlated with severity of symptoms in asthmatic subjects who had rhinovirus infection,63 which mimics what is seen in subjects infected with rhinovirus alone. Not surprisingly, there was also a correlation between CXCL8 levels and neutrophils found in the airway. This report found no differences in airway hyperreactivity of asthmatic subjects on rhinovirus infection, which is in contrast to other published studies, but did find an increased sensitivity to histamine challenge. Another investigation examining the different cell types recruited to the respiratory tract during the common cold found a difference in the number of mast cells present in allergic patients versus those seen in nonallergic patients on viral infection.64 This result could account for the increased sensitivity to histamine that was observed by van Benten et al.64 This report also found that the number of CCL5- and CCL11-producing cells increased on viral infection in both allergic and nonallergic individuals. The investigators also observed an increase in almost every type of inflammatory cell, including eosinophils, T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, regardless of allergen sensitization. Other research has demonstrated a correlation between IFN-\u03b3 levels and symptom scores in rhinovirus-infected asthmatic subjects. Those patients with a higher ratio of IFN-\u03b3/IL-5 mRNA in the airways had less severe symptom scores. Interestingly, these subjects also had no detectable virus 14 days after infection, whereas those patients with a lower IFN-\u03b3/IL-5 mRNA ratio had worse symptoms and detectable virus at 14 days after infection.65 The implications of this latter study are that the virus itself might not cause the exacerbation of asthma, but rather the individual's host response to the virus could be responsible. In this case perhaps higher levels of IL-5 or lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 are responsible for delayed viral clearance. The mechanism could be due to recruitment of inappropriate cells or unnecessary regulation of cells already recruited. Although these results suggest that there are few differences in the types of inflammatory processes that occur in allergic individuals infected with a respiratory virus when compared with nonallergic individuals, it is likely that exacerbation of allergic asthma by viral infection still exists.",

If both viral infection and allergen exposure do not occur at the same time, then the increase in inflammation caused by the virus has a limited ability to exacerbate an allergic response. Confirmation of this hypothesis stems from a report demonstrating that there was a higher risk of hospital admission for exacerbation of asthma in patients who were both infected with a respiratory virus and exposed to allergen at the same time.66 Another study in which allergic individuals were infected 1 week after allergen exposure reported that subjects infected with rhinovirus had no differences in airway hyperreactivity when compared with infected nonallergic individuals. This provides further evidence that viral infection and allergen exposure need to be concurrent for exacerbation to occur.67 However, concomitant exposure to allergen and virus is likely not the only cause of asthma exacerbation because nonallergic asthmatic subjects can also experience periods of increased wheezing.68\n",

These models sensitize mice to an allergen and then infect the mice with virus before allergen challenge. Although several models have proved that influenza69 and RSV70 can increase inflammation in the lungs of allergic mice on infection and augment the allergic response, other studies have actually proved the opposite. For example, one study shows that influenza infection actually inhibits the recruitment of TH2 cells to the BAL fluid of allergic mice.3 A report comparing the effects of several viruses on animals previously sensitized to allergen showed that although both influenza and RSV induced similar patterns of inflammation, influenza downregulated the expression of type 2 cytokines in the lung.2 It is possible that some of the changes in inflammation that take place on respiratory viral infection of allergic mice are due to differences in chemokine expression. For instance, RSV infection increased levels of CCL11,71 CCL3, and CCL5 in the lungs of allergic mice (Schaller and Lukacs, unpublished data). The increase in chemokines could cause an increase in T cells to the lungs and BAL fluid of allergen-sensitized mice. This has been shown in both an influenza69 and an RSV model of exacerbated asthma (Schaller and Lukacs, unpublished data). The research using the influenza model demonstrated that allergen-specific cells can be recruited to the lymph node on viral infection and secrete IL-4. This suggests a prominent role for T cells during the virally exacerbated response.",

These studies have shown that OVA-specific T cells of both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets can be recruited to the lung and BAL fluid nonspecifically, even in the absence of an influenza infection.72, 73 Viral infection with wild-type influenza increased recruitment of these T cells to the lung and lymph node; however, only the influenza virus expressing OVA peptide was able to induce activation and expansion of the OVA-specific T-cell population. These studies provide insight into the mechanism of asthma exacerbation. Although respiratory viral infection causes increased recruitment of T cells to the lung and lymph node, only some of these T cells are specific for viral antigen. In addition, some of the recruited T cells might be specific for inhaled allergens. If allergen exposure occurs at the time of viral infection, the increase in allergen-specific T cells to the lung would cause an increased allergic response. In addition to an ongoing viral infection, this could cause increased airway hyperreactivity and increased pathology in the respiratory tract.",

Although some of this response is determined by the biology of the virus, genetic variability of the host also plays a role. For instance, the TH1/TH2 cytokine ratio in the airways during infection with rhinovirus determines how long the viral infection endures. By this same theory, it is possible that the amount of CCL5 produced during RSV infection determines host responses to later immune stimuli in the lung and that the amount of CXCL8 produced during adenoviral infection correlates with the degree of exacerbation of a patient with COPD.

A better understanding of how the host responds to different respiratory viral infections will also contribute significantly to our understanding of immunology in general. For example, how virus biology affects cell signaling is key in understanding how the host later responds to an infection.
