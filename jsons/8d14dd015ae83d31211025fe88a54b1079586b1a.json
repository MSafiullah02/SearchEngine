In addition to the considerable workload challenges, surgeons are faced with a number of uncertainties regarding their own safety, practice, and overall patient care. This guide has been drafted at short notice to advise on specific issues related to surgical service provision and the safety of minimally invasive surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although laparoscopy can theoretically lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, there is no evidence available to confirm this is the case with COVID-19. The ultimate decision on the approach should be made after considering the proven benefits of laparoscopic techniques versus the potential theoretical risks of aerosolization. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties and all members of the OR staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status. Pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open. All emergent endoscopic procedures performed during the pandemic should be considered as high risk and PPE must be used by all endoscopy staff.",

There are different levels of urgency related to patient needs, and judgment is required to discern between them. However, as the numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring care is expected to escalate over the next few weeks, the surgical care of patients should be limited to those whose needs are imminently life threatening. These may include patients with malignancy that could progress or with active symptoms that require urgent care. All others should be delayed until after the peak of the pandemic is seen. This minimizes the risk to both patient and health care team, as well as minimizes utilization of necessary resources, such as beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE).",

All non-urgent in-person clinic/office visits should be cancelled or postponed, unless needed to triage active symptoms or manage wound care. All patient visits should be handled remotely when possible, and in person only when absolutely necessary. Access to clinics should be maintained for those special circumstances to avoid patients seeking care in the Emergency Department (ED). Only a minimum of required support personnel should be present for these visits, and PPE should again be appropriately utilized. When in critical need, consideration should be given to redeploying OR resources for intensive care needs. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings should be held virtually as possible and/or limited to core team members only, including surgeon, pathologist, Clinical Nurse Specialist, radiologist, oncologist, and coordinator.

We will therefore continue to monitor emerging evidence and support novel research to address these issues. Testing all patients before surgery is desirable 3. Consent discussion with patients to cover the risk of COVID-19 exposure and the potential consequences 4. Dedicated COVID-19 OR must be used during the pandemic with a minimum number of staff members during the procedure 5. All members of the OR/endoscopy staff should use PPE in all procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status 6. A closed smoke evacuation/filtration system with Ultra Low Particulate Air Filtration (ULPA) capability should be used during MIS 7. Minimize the use of energy sources (risk of aerosolization) during surgery and endoscopy 8. All pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated from the port attached to the filtration device before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open 9. Since patients can present with gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19, all emergent endoscopic procedures performed in the current environment should be considered as high risk 10. Advanced endoscopic procedures that require additional insufflation and or energy sources should be avoided 2. It is strongly recommended, however, that consideration be given to the possibility of viral contamination to staff during open, laparoscopic, or robotic surgery and that protective measures are strictly employed for OR staff safety and to maintain a functioning workforce. 3. Although previous research has shown that laparoscopy can lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, [1] [2] [3] there is no evidence to indicate that this effect is seen with COVID-19, nor that it would be isolated to MIS procedures. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties. For MIS procedures, use of devices to filter released CO 2 for aerosolized particles should be strongly considered.",

Practical measures for laparoscopy 1. Incisions for ports should be as small as possible to allow for the passage of ports but not allow for leakage around ports. 2. CO 2 insufflation pressure should be kept to a minimum and an ultrafiltration (smoke evacuation system or filtration) should be used, if available. 3.
