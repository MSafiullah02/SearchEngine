This approach recognises that the contingencies of communication mean these social encounters can rarely -if ever -'follow the script.' 64 The recommendations reflect this complexity, to help explain, for instance, why people discuss sensitive future matters indirectly in some circumstances and explicitly in other circumstances. The communication practices described in Box 1 range from some that are relatively more cautious and indirect, to those that are relatively more forceful and direct. It is important to consider, on a case-by-case basis, which approaches are likely to be most suitable. As always in evidence-based practice, quality evidence should inform, but not replace, clinicians' decisions about how to provide care that is appropriate for individual patients and their circumstances. 65",

These solicitations are often achieved through a 'perspective display invitation', which seeks another person's opinion. 63 Examples include: \"Do you know her preferences of the kind of quality of life she would want?\" 35 and \"What do you see as (pause) as the-happening in the future?\" 32 Patients and family members sometimes responded to these types of questions by raising matters related to illness progression or end of life. 36 Also, by first soliciting a patient or family member's perspective, the clinician can then take the patient's or family member's perspective into account when providing their own perspective. 34, 63 How clinicians, patients, and family members refer indirectly to the future There are a diverse range of practices that can be used to more or less indirectly refer to illness progression or end of life. The most indirect practices included clinicians alluding to the likelihood of illness progression, such as by stating that current treatment has been exhausted: \"I think we've gotten as much as we're going to get from this treatment.\" 40 The least indirect practices, that nevertheless avoid explicit references such as 'death' or 'dying' are euphemisms such as \"when he passes.\" 41 Towards the middle of this spectrum of indirect practices are references to time, such as \"I think he probably has a limited amount of time now.\" 42 There is some evidence that indirect discussions about illness progression and end of life is the default way of talking about such matters. This is particularly the case when the person being discussed is either involved in the conversation or is a significant for one or more parties to the conversation. 28, 32, 34, 41 How clinicians, patients, and family members refer explicitly to the future In contrast to practices that discuss future deterioration and end of life indirectly, these studies explore instances where such matters are made explicit. On some occasions, discussions about end of life were initiated by clinicians indirectly, and subsequently made explicit by patients. 32, 34 In general, clinicians' explicit references to end of life appear to be more common after the matter has been made explicit by patients themselves. 37, 38 There are, however, exceptions where clinicians initiate more explicit discussions about illness progression and end of life. Sometimes, in instances where patients or family members seem to avoid talking about illness progression or end of life, clinicians can respond by referring to these matters more explicitly, 32,34 such as with: \"Do you worry about what's coming?\" 34 Another exception is when clinicians explicitly discuss death to promote acceptance of treatment. The following is one such instance: \"If we don't do it\u2026it will come back and if it comes back it will be deadly.\" 46 Evidence suggests these explicit references to death to warrant acceptance of treatment only tend to occur after patients have displayed some resistance to treatment recommendations. 46, 47 How clinicians linked to something previously said or done (or not said or done) Studies found that clinicians can mention something said or done in the recent or distant past that is related to illness progression or end of life, then use this to promote further discussion about these matters. Examples include: \"So coming back to what you were saying before\u2026part of it is the fear of what might happen?\" 34 ; \"Do you remember when you first came on the ward here?...Things were pretty desperate\u2026And we got you on a little syringe pump with the pain medicine in?\" 49 There are documented instances where patients respond to such solicitations with matters relating to illness progression or end of life. 34 Clinicians can also link to something a patient has not said, to provide a basis for asking about it: \"You haven't mentioned AIDS as a concern today. How much of a concern is that?\" 31 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

These contexts include circumstances where a patient or family member has displayed reticence to discuss these matters, or to question a patient or family member's expressed plans or expectations for the future. 19, 49 How clinicians frame a difficult matter as universal or general In contrast to hypothetical scenarios, which involve discussions related to the individual patient, this type of practice involved framing matters abstractly, as something that could be universally faced by anyone rather than a particular patient specifically. 19 This abstract framing occurs in the following instance: \"\u2026sometimes when people are really unwell\u2026what we do is we get them some medicine at home.\" 49 There is some evidence that universal statements are more likely in relation to matters that have not been raised by a patient or family member in the past. 30 Their use softens the direct relevance of the matter being discussed to the patient. 49 How clinicians acknowledge uncertainty about the future This practice involves clinicians using expressions that qualified their level of certainty, as well as explicit statements of uncertainty. The first part of the following instance includes qualifying expressions ('looks like' and 'probably'), and the second part an explicit statement of uncertainty: \"This looks like the last days probably\u2026We have learned that we have no idea to predict how many.\" 42 This practice demonstrates that prognostic uncertainty does not need to prevent discussions about difficult matters such as illness progression and end of life. 42 How clinicians explore options related to illness progression and end of life By exploring options, clinicians can make apparent to patients and family members different possibilities for future care. Sometimes clinicians present options as equivalent, while other times they convey a preference for one option. The studies included in this review span this diversity, with one study finding that exploring options informed collaborative decision making in the context of illness progression, 58 the other finding that exploring options was used to negatively appraise particular treatment options in the context of illness progression. 57 Due to the small number of included studies, and their distinct findings, further research is warranted to understand broader implications for clinical practice.",

For instance, recommendations to elicit the patient's perspective (SPIKES), assess perception of illness (VitalTalk), and assess illness understanding (SICG) are consistent with the second recommendation listed in Box 1. This review also documents practices that extend beyond those recommended in these available resources, such as considering why specific communication practices such as communicating indirectly and using hypothetical scenarios may be useful. This highlights a key advantage of using direct empirical evidence to understand what constitutes effective communication in clinical settings. 71 The studies included in this rapid review examine data collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. Although they do not directly examine difficult conversations in the context of a pandemic, the included studies consider a diverse range of conversations collected across many different clinical specialties. The identification of common types of communicative practices used across these diverse settings increases confidence that the findings of this review are transferrable to the difficult discussions clinicians must have with patients and family members during situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. The broad focus of this review means its findings can also be transferred to other difficult conversations about illness progression and end of life that occur in clinical settings outside of pandemics.",

In particular, further research is needed to understand ways clinicians acknowledge uncertainty and explore options with patients and their families. Additional research is also needed to understand how clinicians manage conversations about difficult matters when healthcare systems are placed under considerable strain, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through detailed analysis of the difficult conversations that occur in healthcare, an increasingly clearer understanding will emerge to enhance this fundamental part of clinical practice, and to thereby improve the experience of patients and their families.",
