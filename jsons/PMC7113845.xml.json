The virus is endemic in western areas of the former Soviet Union and in southeastern and southwestern Europe; eastern and central Asia (Bente et al., 2013). Hyalomma spp. ticks are considered to be the most important vector for human transmission in the epidemiology of CCHF. Human to human transmission was documented after contact with blood and other body fluids. Human infection with CCHFV often results in severe hemorrhagic disease characterized by extensive ecchymosis, visceral bleeding, hepatic dysfunction (Erg\u00f6n\u00fcl, 2006) with high case mortality rates. The average mortality rate is often cited at 30% (Bente et al., 2013).",

However, there is still a debate on the ribavirin therapeutic beneficial treatment (Soares-Weiser et al., 2010). Other treatments such as type I interferon (Van Eeden et al., 1985); corticosteroid therapy (Dokuzoguz et al., 2013), or the efficient polyclonal anti-CCHFV human immunoglobulin treatment, (Vassilenko et al., 1990), were tested without removing the need of new antiviral molecules.",

Chlorpromazine a well known anti-psychotic drug showed antiviral activity against adenovirus (Diaconu et al., 2010), Ebola virus (Bhattacharyya et al., 2010) and coronavirus (De Wilde et al., 2014).

Reversible side effect can be observed for mucosal pigmentation after months of discontinuation of chloroquine treatment (Armor et al., 2002). Cardiomyopathy side effect can be lessened after cessation of chloroquine treatment and prescription of a combined therapy of candesartan and carvedilol treatment (Lopez-Ruiz and Uribe, 2014). Contrary to hyperpigmentation and cardiomyopathy, retinopathy is an irreversible side effect of long term chloroquine treatment and can appear even after usage of chloroquine has stopped (Kazi et al., 2013). Nevertheless, daily dose of the chloroquine seems to be relevant for the development of ocular side effect, the risk of retinopathy is lowered if this dose not exceed 4 mg/kg/day (Lerman et al., 2009) or is minimal when the daily dose not exceed 250 mg (Armor et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Previously, chloroquine was proposed to be used against several viral infections (Rolain et al., 2007). The antiviral efficacy of this molecule was shown on different cell culture with IC50 related to each pathogens. Chloroquine was shown to inhibit Chikungunya virus (IC50 10 \u03bcM) (Khan et al., 2010), Dengue virus (Farias et al., 2013), coronavirus (IC50 8.8 \u03bcM) (Keyaerts et al., 2004), MERS-CoV (IC50 3.0 \u03bcM) (De Wilde et al., 2014), influenza virus (IC50 3.6 \u03bcM) (Ooi et al., 2006), or Henipavirus (IC50 2 \u03bcM) (Porotto et al., 2009). Chloroquine was also used to inhibit HIV 1 in lineages of monocytes and lymphocytes (Sperber et al., 1993) which are known to be HIV 1 target cells. In adults a 10 mg/kg CQ oral dose is followed by a 263 ng/ml plasma peak concentration (Walker et al., 1983), which is close to the chloroquine IC50. Moreover chloroquine is known to accumulate in CCHFV target organs, such liver and spleen (IPCS Inchem). In this study, a similar chloroquine SI was assessed in two permissive cells (Vero E6) and human target cells (Huh7). The chloroquine post infection addition was inefficient for influenza viruses (Di Trani et al., 2007), while was efficient 2 h post CHIKV infection (Khan et al., 2010). In the same way, CCHFV titer was still reduced when chloroquine was added up to 6 h p.i., suggesting that chloroquine blocks a post entry step in CCHFV replication cycle. In this case, rapid elevation of endosomal pH and abrogation of virus endosome fusion might be the primary mechanism by which virus infectivity is inhibited by chloroquine (Poole and Ohkuma, 1981). The abolishment of the released of sialyltransferase and the Trans-Golgi Network acidification could account for another inhibitory mechanism (Berger et al., 2001). Plasma chloroquine concentration might be influenced by molecule dosage, but a 10 mg/kg first dose is rapidly detectable with a plasma peak concentration until 263 ng/ml (Walker et al., 1983), with a chloroquine accumulation in CCHFV organ targets, such liver or spleen.",
