In this sense, it is important to have one item at hand, such as 75% alcohol, hand sanitizer gel, disinfecting wipes, for instant hand hygiene after we have touched something possibly contaminated by the virus. This is more important for those traveling long\u2010distance using public vehicles or having touched some items frequently touched by other people. This study suggested that instant hand wiping using a wet towel containing soap or sodium hypochlorite removed most viruses from hands. Water containing 1.00% soap powder is not only helpful for wiping away the virus using its surfactant activity but also efficiently inactivates enveloped viruses including coronavirus, as proved by multiple previous studies.\n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n Moreover, water containing 1.00% soap powder is safe for skin and other items including clothes. It is worth noting that the concentration of soap powder and sodium hypochlorite is vital for their wiping and virucidal effects.",

This study showed that N95 masks blocked nearly all the mock virus, and medical masks blocked approximately 97% of the virus, and the homemade mask blocked approximately 95% of the virus. Therefore, the medical masks are not fully protective in hospitals but are useful for common social occasions. When medical masks are in shortage, the homemade masks made of four\u2010layer kitchen paper (each layer contains three thin layers) and one layer of polyester cloth should be helpful, as indicated by this study. The kitchen paper is effective in blocking the virus possibly because of its multiple layers, nonwoven structure, and virus\u2010absorbing property. As we have tested by ourselves, the tested homemade masks are more breathable than the N95 masks. One advantage of the homemade mask is that the kitchen paper can be changed frequently. It is worth noting that the homemade masks shall be of less blocking efficacy if made of fewer layers of kitchen paper. Other types of homemade masks, especially those made of cloth alone, may be unable to block the virus and thus confer no protection against the virus.\n20\n, \n21\n Additionally, although a person inhales much more than 100 times a day, the mocking data are reliable because aerosols containing the virus to be inhaled by a person on most common social occasions are fewer than in this experiment.",

In effect, the conclusions of these RCTs could be erroneous, as reflected by the following assumed scenario. Supposed the virus could have ten opportunities to infect a human during a period of 30 days, wearing medical masks could block three of the 10 opportunities and thus reduce the infection risk by 30%, although it itself could not block the other seven opportunities during the 30 days. Therefore, the fact that medical mask\u2010wearing did not reduce the infection rate could suggest that medical mask\u2010wearing is inadequate to prevent the infection, rather than useless for reducing the infection risk. Some other RCTs and many nonrandomized studies regarding the use of medical masks supported the notion that wearing medical masks could reduce infection risks of some viral respiratory diseases.\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n Moreover, medical mask\u2010wearing can enhance one's vigilance, prevent direct hand\u2010mouth or hand\u2010nose contact, and reduce air contamination of pathogens from infected people.",
