Although the overall mortality rate is low [1], diabetes mellitus (DM) has emerged as a distinctive comorbidity that is associated with severe disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients [2]. Infact, DM has emerged as an independent predictor of admission to intensive care unit or invasive ventilation or death in patient with COVID-19 even after adjustment for age [3]. Maintaining a good glycemic control would boost the innate immune system and help prevent the grave consequences [4]. However, as a result of nationwide lockdown imposed by the Government to curb the spread of the pandemic, comprehensive diabetes care and glycemic control has taken a back seat.",

The impact of social distancing, quarantine and lockdown on lifestyles would have probably led to worsening of glucose control. Firstly, lockdown and social distancing meant for community containment would have limited the physical activities of the people with DM. Secondly, restriction in food supplies during the lockdown would have compelled people with DM to alter their dietary habits that were earlier associated with good glycemic control. Thirdly, procurement of anti-diabetic medications and glucose strips would have been difficult amid the ongoing restrictions. Lastly, people with diabetes mellitus would not have been able to visit their physicians for routine clinic follow-ups; hence, fine-tuning of anti-diabetic medications would not have been possible. This would have led to sustained periods of hyperglycemia (and probably frequent episodes of hypoglycemia that were not looked into in this study) which would have been left unaddressed in the absence of in-clinic consultations.",

            "text": "Although the US National Taskforce has established national standards for diabetes self-management education and support [13], the same set of guidelines might not be applicable to the Indian patients. Hence, diabetic self-management practices should cater to the Indian population and address their routine habits. Taking cues from Indian data [[14], [15], [16], [17]], diabetes self-care practices should center on the following components for homebound people unable to comply with routine clinic visits during this period.1.\nDiet: Indian diet is already rich in carbohydrates. A study conducted among 796 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus had shown that carbohydrates constituted 64.1% of total energy from diet, higher than that recommended in India [18]. The consumption of carbohydrates is expected to increase amid the lockdown due to limited availability of fresh vegetables and fruits. Indians also happen to be one of largest consumers of sweetened food items [19]. Since sweetened food items can be stored for long (even without refrigeration), the consumption of such items would be expected to increase during times of lockdown. However, certain simple advices can help people with DM maintain a healthy diet.\u2022Any dietary advice should begin with calculation of an approximate required total daily calorie intake. Required total daily calorie intake of obese and non-obese patient on sedentary lifestyle is 20 kcal/kg and 22\u201325 kcal/kg ideal body weight, respectively. As a simple example, an average Indian man of height 165 cm should ideally weigh 62 kg and would require 1850 kcal to maintain a healthy weight assuming that the person is leading a sedentary lifestyle [14].\u2022As per the prevalent Indian norms, the total daily calorie intake has to be distributed over three major meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and an evening snack.\u2022The daily carbohydrate intake should be approximately 50\u201360% of the total calorie intake; e.g. for an average Indian man leading a sedentary lifestyle, carbohydrates should be 225\u2013270 g/day [14].\u2022Complex carbohydrates should be preferred over refined carbohydrates and its products (e.g., whole grain bread [roti] over white [maida] bread). Millets (bajra, ragi, jowar) can be consumed. The total dietary fiber in daily diet should be 25\u201340 g/day. Whole grains, cereals, pulses, vegetables, and fruits contain high dietary fiber.\u2022Intake of sugar-sweetened food items like fruit juice, aerated beverages and sugar syrups should be strictly avoided [19].\u2022Fats should provide not more than 30% of total calorie/day and saturated fat (vanaspati, dalda, ghee) intake should be minimum [14]. Emphasis should be placed on low fat milk (double toned).\u2022Ideally three teaspoons of oil per day should be used in cooking. Preferred cooking oil would be a combination of two or more vegetable oils (one being groundnut/sesame/rice bran/cottonseed/palmolein/olive oil and the other being mustard/canola/soybean/sunflower/safflower oil) [14].\u2022Protein intake should be 1 g/kg/day, considering the quality of protein in a usual Indian vegetarian diet. However, protein intake needs to be reduced in those with diabetic nephropathy and macroalbuminuria (0.8 g/kg/day) [20]. Recommended protein sources for a vegetarian would be soya, pulses and low fat dairy products while in a non-vegetarian would be egg white and, if available, fresh water fish and lean poultry. Red meat should be avoided.\u2022Salt intake should be less than 5 g of sodium chloride/day and the age-old Indian practice of adding extra salt at the dining table should be avoided.\u2022Diabetes plate method is a simple yet effective way to provide a visual guide to portion calories in a food plate keeping the total calorie intake/day and the routine Indian diet in mind. Half of the plate should consist of vegetable curry (e.g. cauliflower, brinjal etc). One quarter of plates should consist of proteins in form of dal/soya/egg white and if available fresh fish/lean poultry. Remaining quarter of plate should consist of complex carbohydrates in form of cereals (roti made from whole wheat/bajra/ragi, brown rice, etc.).\u2022The incessant desire of Indians (specially while at home) to consume tea (with added sugar) should be curbed. Tea intake should be limited and that too, without added sugar. Artificial sweeteners, if available, could be used in moderation [14]. Likewise, the habit of consuming snacks (like fritters) every time tea is taken should be strongly discouraged.\u2022Patients will additionally benefit by keeping in regular touch with a nutritionists via online consultations. Telehealth-delivered dietary interventions targeting dietary patterns has been shown to improve diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake and dietary sodium intake [21].\u2022Unhealthy habits of smoking, drinking and betel chewing should be avoided.\n2.\nPhysical activity: Physical activity is a part and parcel of routine diabetes self-care; however, lockdown would restrict the outdoor physical activities of people with DM. Hence, they should be informed about alternative physical activity programs that can be undertaken within the safe confines of home.\u2022A total of 60 min of physical activity/day would be ideal that could be divided between aerobic activity, work-related activity and muscle-strengthening activity [15].\u2022Aerobic activity of at least moderate-intensity for a minimum of 30 min/day would be the goal. This could include brisk walking (walking at an intensity wherein an individual finds speaking difficult but not impossible) in rooftop or lawn. If available, treadmills could be used. Other means of aerobic activity like stationary jogging, stationary cycling and gardening could be resorted to. The total duration of aerobic activity could be accumulated in small 10\u201315 min periods, two or three times a day.\u2022Work-related physical activity, like climbing stairs, performing household chores, would comprise about 15 min/day.\u2022Lastly, 15 min/day should be dedicated for muscle-strengthening activities that could include bodyweight exercises (like push-ups, squats, sit-ups, crunches and forward flexes) and resistance exercise in the form of lifting lightweights. In absence of home fitness accessories, readily available household stuffs like buckets half filled with water or even small bags filled with objects could be used.\u2022Joint mobility and stretching exercises like yoga could be part of the regimen.\u2022Intensity and type of physical activity should be tailored to an individual\u2019s ability and fitness level. Caution must be exercised for patients with co-existing heart diseases and history of hypoglycemia. Physicians could help patients choose the type and nature of physical activity, guide them by sharing sample exercise videos and reinforce the need to remain physically active at each online interaction.\n3.\nMedication adherence:\u2022Through teleconsultations, physicians could ensure drug compliance. Diabetes educators could help patients procure anti-diabetic medications via online stores which might otherwise be difficult to obtain amid the lockdown.\u2022In addition, physicians/diabetes educators should make patients aware of contraindications of hydroxychloroquine (diabetic retinopathy or seizure history) to prevent injudicious use of the drug as an anti-diabetic amid the COVID 19 pandemic.\n4.\nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG):\n\u2022SMBG of capillary blood is an acceptable alternative to plasma glucose estimation in present scenario.\u2022For patients on insulin with poor glycemic control or recurrent hypoglycemia, SMBG is advised at least 4 times/day, i.e., at fasting, before lunch, before dinner and at bedtime. Each value is to be recorded over a span of at least 3 days to avoid multiple pricks a day. In addition, capillary glucose should be checked at any clinical suspicion of hypoglycemia. For patients on oral hypoglycemic agents with acceptable control, measuring fasting and post-prandial capillary blood glucose once or twice a week is acceptable.\u2022Availability of glucose strips could be a challenge in the current scenario. Taking help of online pharmacy stores and placing orders well before existing stocks dwindle could be the best solution in this regard.\n5.\nCoping with hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia could become a major deterrent to comprehensive diabetes care amid the ongoing pandemic. In the absence of physician\u2019s advice, hypoglycemia could recur, perpetuating hypoglycemic unawareness and leading to a vicious cycle of hypoglycemia begetting further hypoglycemic episodes. In addition to the usual causes, stressful situations have also been shown to precipitate hypoglycemic episodes in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [22]. Apart from the life-threatening neuroglucopenic symptoms, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia result in diminished psychological wellbeing and quality of life. Hence, hypoglycemia needs to be prevented at all costs. Use of telemedicine has been shown to reduce the risk of moderate hypoglycemia in diabetic patients [23].\u2022Through teleconsultations, physicians/diabetes educators should make patients aware of the common symptoms of hypoglycemia, especially those on insulin and sulfonylureas. Skipping of meals should be discouraged.\u2022The need for monitoring capillary blood glucose at bedtime for patients on basal-bolus regimen should be repeatedly emphasized, as it might prevent them from unknowingly slipping into nocturnal hypoglycemia while being asleep.\u2022Anti-diabetic regimens should be promptly reconsidered following a hypoglycemic episode via online consultations.\u2022In addition, patients and their caregivers should be educated about the measures that could be readily instituted at home in an unfortunate situation of hypoglycemia. Patients could be advised to keep a stock of glucose (like Glucon D) at home. Often overlooked is the need to take a regular meal following termination of an episode of hypoglycemia with oral carbohydrate [22]; the same should be re-emphasized during teleconsultations.\n6.\nCoping with other complications:\n\u2022Patients, especially people with type 1 diabetes mellitus, should be made aware of the common symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and when to call for help.\u2022Measures to prevent DKA and following sick-day guidelines including non-omission of insulin should be reiterated.\u2022Patients with retinopathy on intravitreal injections or prior history of retinal photocoagulation should be educated regarding the red flags of retinopathy and when to consult an ophthalmologist urgently.\u2022Routine foot care practices should be continued.\n7.\nPsychosocial issues:\u2022Patients should feel free to discuss psychological issues with their routine physicians via telecommunication medium. In addition, physicians should also routinely enquire about the status of mental health of the diabetic patients.\u2022Physicians/diabetes educators can in turn coordinate teleconsultations with practicing psychiatrists to help patients cope with psychological problems amid the ongoing pandemic.\u2022A simple way to help patients cope with psychological stress is to voluntary give up the feeling of being locked up in home and in return spend quality time with their near and dear ones. Another mean of avoiding undue stress is to intentionally minimize watching, reading or listening to news about COVID-19 [6].\n\n",

Counseling requires individualized approach depending on patient\u2019s needs.2.Communication barrier: Good reference books, educational videos and other scientific information could be provided to patients having internet access using mHealth technology and telemedicine.3.Cultural barrier: As has already been narrated, consumption of high carbohydrate meals and \u2018ghee\u2019 (saturated fats) is a norm in India. \u2018Three major meals\u2019 diet is more popular over small frequent meals. Therefore, meal plans must be individualized to meet the total calorie goals.4.Socioeconomic barrier: Poor access to patient-centered care, internet and lack of affordability in maintaining a good balanced diet remains a concern for poor patients like laborers during country wide lockdown. Government can find a way to provide them with free high quality generic drugs and educational pamphlets.5.Social distancing: Government directives ensuring continued supply of medications and provision of essential investigations for patients are highly welcome.6.Legal barrier: Physicians always have been skeptical about using telemedicine in their practice owing to lack of definite legislation in India. Recent Government guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on teleconsultations have enabled physicians to facilitate self-management via teleconsultations after overcoming this barrier [24].\n",
