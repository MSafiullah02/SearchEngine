Over the past several months, infections have spread throughout the globe, resulting pandemic designation by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 1 . Because most reports of COVID-19 have focused on severe respiratory illness in adult populations, data on the manifestation and extent of disease in children is limited 2 . Children comprise the minority of symptomatic patients, with <1% of reported infections occurring in children < 10 years of age 3 . Several recent studies of COVID-19 in the pediatric population in China demonstrate a large portion of cases are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. In a study of 8 infected families, 9 positive children were identified, but asymptomatic infection occurred in 66.7% of pediatric cases 4 . Qiu et al noted that in 36 children with infection, 47% were asymptomatic or exhibited mild acute upper respiratory illness symptoms 5 . Dong et al found that in 731 children with confirmed SARS-2-CoV infection, 12.9% were asymptomatic and 43.1% demonstrated only mild symptoms",
