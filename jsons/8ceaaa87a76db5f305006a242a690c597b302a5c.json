In this paper, a detailed comparison is given of the behavior of continuous and discrete models for two representative time-delay models, namely a model for HIV and an extended logistic growth model. For each model, there are seven different time-delay versions because there are seven different positions to include time delays. For the seven different time-delay versions of each model, proofs are given of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov-Hopf bifurcations in the differential equations and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations in the difference equations. We show that only five of the seven time-delay versions have bifurcations and that all bifurcation versions have supercritical limit cycles with one having a repelling cycle and four having attracting cycles. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the analytical results and to show that critical times for Neimark-Sacker bifurcations are less than critical times for Andronov-Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization tends to zero.

In many of these time-delay models, bifurcations occur as values of parameters are changed. For example, Andronov-Hopf bifurcations can occur in differential equation systems and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations can occur in difference equation systems at critical values of time delays. In some cases, the changes in system parameters can also lead to chaotic-type solutions (see, e.g. [17, 18] ).",

However, as the growth rate of diseases (such as HIV) or other kinds of populations (such as fish or animal populations) can be a slow process or the collection of data may often only be carried out at regular intervals such as a month or a year, it is often only possible to construct difference equation models. One method that is often used to construct a difference equation model is to use a first-order Euler method to approximate the differential equation model [1, 2, [19] [20] [21] [22] . This method is also often used to solve It\u00f3 stochastic differential equations as, for example, in the Euler-Mayurama method [1, 23] .",

The development of antiretroviral therapy using reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI) and protease inhibitors (PI) has been shown to be an effective method of controlling the spread of HIV by depressing the level of virus in an HIV+ person below a detectable level [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] 36] and to effectively stop transmission of HIV from an HIV+ person to an uninfected person [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] .

It can be seen that the results for the HIV and ELM models are similar. For the HIV model, the Andronov-Hopf and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations occur for the bounded region 1 < R 0 < 3 for version 1, and for unbounded regions R 0 > 1 for versions 3, 5, 7, and for R 0 > 3 for version 6. Similarly, for the ELM model, the Andronov-Hopf and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations occur for the bounded region 1 < R 0 < 2 for version 1, and for unbounded regions R 0 > 1 for versions 3, 5, 7, and for R 0 > 2 for version 6. It can also be seen from these tables, that, for version 1 of both models, the C5 conditions of Theorem 3 correspond to a repelling invariant closed curve for \u03c4 > \u03c4 c , whereas for versions 3, 5, 6, 7 the C5 conditions correspond to an attracting invariant closed curve for \u03c4 > \u03c4 c .",

Therefore, the Andronov-Hopf bifurcations will occur as \u03c4 increases through \u03c4 c for all versions.

(50) Plots of critical delay vs antiviral infectiousness factor 9 Conclusions In this paper, the effects of time delays and the associated Andronov-Hopf and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation properties have been studied for two one-dimensional models. The first model has been studied by previous authors as a model for HIV. This model includes the effects of vertical HIV transmission from mother to baby, the effects of births and deaths and treatment by antivirals. The second extended logistic growth model has been studied by previous authors as a model for population growth and for the life cycle of products and services. For each model, we have studied the dynamical behavior of a differential equation model and an equivalent difference equation model obtained from a forward Euler approximation. For both HIV and ELM, we have shown that there are seven different time-delay versions of the differential equation and equivalent difference equation models and that the seven different versions have very different dynamical behavior. Five of these versions undergo bifurcations from the endemic equilibrium point and two of them have stable endemic equilibrium points for all values of time delay. We have given rigorous proofs of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of the equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov-Hopf and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations at critical values of the time delays for the five versions. For the Neimark-Sacker bifurcations, we have proved",
