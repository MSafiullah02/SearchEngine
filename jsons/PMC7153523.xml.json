These cross-sectional measurements aim to understand the general psychological reactions to this public emergency event for both community and medical staff involved in epidemic conditions (Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020, Li et al., 2020). After few weeks, some subjects are asked to finish the inventories for follow-up measurements to obtain longitudinal trajectory of mental state in the population. In addition, understanding the neuroimmune responses in COVID-19 might facilitate the clinical treatment strategies (Kim & Su 2020) for patients with confirmed infections.",
