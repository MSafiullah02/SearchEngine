In the early 20th century, vaccines were mostly produced in animal tissues, such as nervous tissues extracted from rabbits or goats, or obtained from blood serums of infected animals (Aubrit et al. 2015) . Cellbased vaccine manufacturing, which uses cultured cells of mammalian origin as the host to produce viruses, is a highly flexible approach for viral vaccine production (Montomoli et al. 2012) , and has obtained increasing acceptance from regulatory agencies and led to major advances in viral vaccine development. During cellbased vaccine manufacturing, candidate vaccine viruses are grown in mammalian tissue culture of cells with a finite lifespan followed by virus extraction from cells in the liquid culture, purification, and test or modification for specific vaccine production (Vlecken et al. 2013 ) (Figure 1 ). Among the four major types of vaccines, i.e. live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit/ recombinant/polysaccharide/conjugate vaccines, toxoid vaccines, the first three types are suitable to be manufactured using the cell-based approach. Several animal cells have been used for vaccine production for years, such as African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells that were used to produce vaccines against polio and rabies, Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that were employed to manufacture influenza vaccines, and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) that were used to produce vaccines against measles, mumps, rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (Genzel 2015) . As one successful example, IMOVAX V R Polio is a sterile suspension of types 1-3 of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine and prepared from poliovirus cultured in Vero cells, which has been widely used to prevent poliomyelitis for both primary immunization and boosters through stimulating antibody production in the body. Health intervention using polio vaccine was proved to be cost-effective in the United States (Thompson and Tebbens 2006) , Kano and Nigeria (Qadar 2014) . Besides cost-effectiveness, the use of cell lines in vaccine production is advantageous in its fast speed and stable vaccine qualities produced. Additionally, cell-based approaches allow for multiple viral vaccines being produced in the same production platforms in a more sterile environment (Audsley and Tannock 2008; Perdue et al. 2011 ). However, cell-based vaccines require adaptation of the vaccine strains to the new cells (Genzel 2015) . For instance, selection pressure was used to adapt MDCK cells to grow in suspension to produce influenza viruses, and the generated MDCK suspension cells were used by Novartis Vaccines to produce the first licenced cell-based influenza vaccine (Gregersen et al. 2011 ). This adaption sometimes proves to be a difficult task with variable outcomes, resulting in the limited established cell lines for vaccine production despite the intense efforts on novel cell line design for vaccine production (Genzel 2015) . Over the past few years, enhancing virus replication in hosts with a goal of reducing vaccine manufacturing costs has been attempted. For example, van der Sanden et al. found that knocking down multiple genes, alone or in pairwise combination, increased viral titres more than 20-fold and over 50-fold, respectively, in poliovirus (van der Sanden et al. 2016 ). On the other hand, vaccines against different viruses need to be produced using different cell lines, due to the limited tropism of the viruses. This specificity is one of the reasons why the technical cost of the development of a novel cell line for vaccine production remains high. Further, some viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) impose great challenges to human health but still lack effective vaccines available on the market (Morello et al. 2007; Sokal et al. 2007) , and viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) are difficult to culture by nature that needs a robust culture model to be established (Zeisel et al. 2015) . Thus, there is an urgent need to break the specificity between host and viruses with the potential of constructing a cell line that can be infected by a broad range of viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 109, "text": "(Perdue et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 296, "end": 316, "text": "(Aubrit et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 489, "end": 512, "text": "(Montomoli et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 905, "end": 925, "text": "(Vlecken et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1610, "text": "(Genzel 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2052, "text": "(Thompson and Tebbens 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2084, "text": "(Qadar 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2406, "text": "(Audsley and Tannock 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2425, "text": "Perdue et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2530, "text": "(Genzel 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2777, "end": 2799, "text": "(Gregersen et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3029, "end": 3042, "text": "(Genzel 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3339, "end": 3403, "text": "50-fold, respectively, in poliovirus (van der Sanden et al. 2016", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3870, "end": 3891, "text": "(Morello et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 3892, "end": 3910, "text": "Sokal et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 4044, "end": 4064, "text": "(Zeisel et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 928, "end": 937, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A few cell lines have already been used for the production of multiple viruses.

Many factors are known to affect susceptibility of the cells to viral invasion. For example, host antiviral restriction factors induce cellular resistance against a number of viral pathogens (Kluge et al. 2015) , and capsid proteins of small non-enveloped DNA viruses play an important role in intracellular membrane perturbation in the early stages of viral infection (Bilkova et al. 2014) . Therefore, identifying the key determinants influencing the susceptibility of cells to different viruses, as classified by the Baltimore system, is of the utmost importance. Baltimore classification is a virus classification system that categorizes viruses into families depending on their type of genome and method of replication. Specifically, this system groups viruses into seven classes: double-stranded DNA viruses (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA virus (ssDNA), doublestranded RNA viruses (dsRNA), positive single-stranded RNA viruses (\u00fessRNA), negative single-stranded RNA viruses (\u00c0ssRNA), positive single-stranded retro RNA viruses (ssRNA-RT) and double-stranded DNA retro viruses (dsDNA-RT) ( Figure 2 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 425, "end": 445, "text": "(Barrett et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 640, "end": 659, "text": "(Kluge et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 818, "end": 839, "text": "(Bilkova et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1542, "end": 1550, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Here we review the viral entry pathways and host receptors mediating viral invasion, with the aim of deciphering the essential factors orchestrating the differential use of cellular receptors involved in the infection of diverse types of viruses.

Virions generally enter host cells through endocytosis, fusion or direct penetration, with endocytosis being the dominant entry mechanism. As endocytosis is prevalent among various types of viruses, fusion and direct penetration are specific to enveloped (possessing an enclosing envelope) and naked (consisting only of a nucleocapsid) viruses, respectively. Viral entry pathways or mechanisms can be cell-type specific, which are primarily determined by host receptors . Or, viruses may adopt distinct modes when entering cells of the same type in the presence of environmental perturbations such as trypsin (Suzuki et al. 1985) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 824, "end": 844, "text": "(Suzuki et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus entry pathways"}, {"text": "There are two types of cellular endocytosis: phagocytosis and pinocytosis (Lakadamyali et al. 2004 ). While phagocytosis is typically employed for large particles and bacteria digestion, pinocytosis is responsible for cellular intake of fluids, macromolecules and small pathogens (Lakadamyali et al. 2004) . Viruses largely utilize pinocytosis to assist endocytosis-mediated cell entry, which could be classified into three subtypes: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and non-clathrin non-caveolin-mediated endocytosis, according to the vesicles used (Mercer et al. 2010) . Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is one of the best characterized types of endocytosis for virus entry. During this pathway, ligands enter cells via clathrincoated pits (CCPs), these pits are internalized to form clathrin-coated vesicles followed by uncoating and subsequent delivery to the early endosomes where they are exposed to an acidic environment (Johnson and Vogt 2010) . Internalized cargoes and membrane proteins are typically progressed to the late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation (Vale-Costa and Amorim 2016). In the latter case, the luminal pH is rapidly reduced from 6.5 to 5.5 (Zhu 2014) . Caveolin-mediated endocytosis occurs via caveolae, caveolin-associated membrane invaginations, which are pinched off to form endocytic vesicles followed by fusion with caveolincontaining membrane compartments (caveosomes) (Lakadamyali et al. 2004 ). This process may or may not involve the recognition of host receptors, but depends on the presence of lipid rafts and cholesterol during virus entry. Once the virus is internalized, it migrates to caveolin positive vesicles that are trafficked to the perinuclear region and fused with caveosomes (Johnson and Vogt 2010) . There is controversy over the nature of the \"caveosome\" once it was found to be an artefact of fixing/staining procedures (Parton and Howes 2010; Engel et al. 2011) . The number of non-clathrin, non-caveolin-mediated endocytosis mechanisms and molecular identities involved in this process are not completely resolved due to the lack of proper biomarkers. This process requires a receptor-mediated conformational transition for efficient cargo internalization (Damm et al. 2005; Grassart et al. 2010) . Alternatively, endocytosis independent of clathrin and caveolin was proposed to be similar to phagocytosis, which transports cargoes using vesicles such as phagosomes (Suzuki et al. 1985) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 98, "text": "(Lakadamyali et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 280, "end": 305, "text": "(Lakadamyali et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 578, "end": 598, "text": "(Mercer et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 953, "end": 976, "text": "(Johnson and Vogt 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1209, "text": "(Zhu 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1458, "text": "(Lakadamyali et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1781, "text": "(Johnson and Vogt 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1929, "text": "(Parton and Howes 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1948, "text": "Engel et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2262, "text": "(Damm et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2263, "end": 2284, "text": "Grassart et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2454, "end": 2474, "text": "(Suzuki et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus entry pathways"}, {"text": "Enveloped viruses can penetrate cells without disrupting the cellular membrane by fusing its envelope with the host cell at the plasma membrane (namely \"fusion\") (Zhang et al. 2010) or utilizing endocytosis (Husain and Moss 2005) .

HCV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which consists of three steps: virus attachment, receptormediated endocytosis and endosomal fusion. After initial attachment of HCV to the host cell surface mediated by heparan sulphate (HS) chains from heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG), more specifically syndecan-1 (SDC1) and SDC4, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), the virus interacts with: (a) co-receptors such as scavenger receptor class B type I (SRBI), CD81, claudin-1 (CLDN1), occludin (OCLN), (b) entry factors such as EGFR (Hu et al. 2018) , ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2) , transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and (c) cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which collaboratively complete endocytosis (Figure 3(A) ).

The existence of three cellular receptors, the paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor-a (PILRa), myelinassociated glycoprotein (MAG), and non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA), of viral gB has been widely accepted. While the expressions of PILRa and MAG (which share 5-12% homology) are limited to certain cell types (Suenaga et al. 2010) , NMHC-IIA is ubiquitously expressed in numerous human tissues and cell lines (Vicente-Manzanares et al. 2009 ). The gD receptors are indispensable for triggering virus entry into the cells. There are three classes of gD receptors which belong to structurally unrelated molecular families. HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator) is the first identified gD receptor, which belongs to the tumour necrosis factor receptor family, and is expressed in a variety of cell types. The second class of receptors includes nectin-1 and -2. While both nectins are broadly expressed in a wide range of human tissues and cell lines, nectin-1 is expressed on all tested cell lines sensitive to HSV-1 and HSV-2 invasion (Akhtar and Shukla 2009) , and nectin-2 is a weak receptor for HSV-2 (Lopez et al. 2000) .

Although the exact molecular mechanism of the RVs-host interaction is not completely understood, the current model proposes the interaction between VP4 and host cellular membrane, during which the trypsin-mediated cleavage releases VP8 \u00c3 from VP5 \u00c3 and exposes the hydrophobic domain of VP5 \u00c3 , leading to membrane disruption and viral penetration (Arias et al. 2015) . The trypsin-mediated cleavage ultimately helps to dissolve the double-shelled viral capsid and cellular membrane. It was shown in vivo that VP4 is stable but non-infectious in the uncleaved state that is advantageous to resist environmental degradation until it infects a susceptible host, and becomes unstable but infectious once cleaved in the lumen of the host's gastrointestinal tract by trypsin (Ludert et al. 1996) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 362, "end": 382, "text": "(Suzuki et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 665, "end": 685, "text": "(Graham et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1088, "text": "(Arias et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1511, "text": "(Ludert et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Direct penetration-an example of a naked RNA virus"}, {"text": "Initiation of infection is mediated by viral attachment and entry receptors, which are essential factors determining the entry pathway and cellular tropism of a given virus.

Extl3 attaches the first N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residue and an enzyme complex composed of Ext1 and Ext2, alternately adds GlcA and GlcNAc to the nascent chain.

Polysaccharides, such as HS, or saccharide derivatives, such as SA, are frequently displayed on cell surfaces and are required for efficient virus attachment and entry into cells (Table 1) . These protruding saccharide chains are conventionally attached to proteins forming proteoglycans, such as HSPG and SA proteoglycan. Proteoglycans are abundantly present in the ECMof virtually all mammalian cells. They have a fiber-like structures that render ECM elastic and adhesive ). In addition to the sticky extracellular environment fostered, partially and primarily by proteoglycans, the polyanionic nature of HS and SA attached to them considerably enhances their ability to interact with positively charged viral glycoproteins. Glycosylation affects protein folding, modulates protein thermostability and is critical for virus attachment and internalization. For instance, JC virus (JCV) infection of host cells depends on its interactions with cell surface asparagine (N)linked SAs and the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT 2A R) (Maginnis et al. 2010 ). However, saccharides are not feasible targets for the modulation of host cells, since glycosylation differs among species, requires additional enzymes and involves many technical problems. Glycosylation refers to the addition of a carbohydrate or glycan to a noncarbohydrate structure that can occur in almost all surface components including proteins and lipids. Glycosylation has many different forms such as N-and O-glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol glycosylation and lipid glycosylation, with the amount, distribution and type varying across species (Cagno et al. 2019 ). These characteristics substantially restrict glycosylation in being considered as targets for surface modulation. Moreover, although binding to saccharides is widely used by viruses for their attachment to the host cell, it has been shown that binding to saccharides is dispensable for infection in cell culture for numerous viruses (e.g. coronaviruses). For example, HSPG blockage results in the failure of SARS virus entry even in the presence of the internalization factor ACE2 (Lang et al. 2011 ). The SA alone enables the infection of influenza (Byrd-Leotis et al. 2017 ) and paramyxoviruses (Villar and Barroso 2006) .

Take TfR as an example, the PCV, which belongs to the Circoviridae family, shares the same Baltimore group II with the CPV that also uses TfR as the receptor (Misinzo 2005) . This generalization applies to viruses of many other families, resulting in several representative (common) internalization receptors corresponding to viruses of all Baltimore groups. In brief, integrins are frequently used by double-stranded DNA (group I: dsDNA) and RNA viruses (group III: dsRNA); TfR is frequently recruited during the entry process of the singlestranded DNA viruses (group II: ssDNA); LDLRs commonly mediate the entry process of the positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses (group IV: \u00fessRNA); CD150 and Nectin4 are likely to facilitate the internalization of negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses (group V: -ssRNA) (von Messling et al. 2005; Pratakpiriya et al. 2012 ).

There are several prevalent viruses that have no vaccine available such as CMV and EBV. Human CMV causes serious problems in immunocompromised or immunologically immature hosts; though many candidate vaccines including live attenuated CMV have been developed, none passed through the phase 3 clinical trial (Morello et al. 2007 ). Thus, the development of a vaccine to prevent human CMV infection has been assigned with the top priority by the US Institute of Medicine (Sung and Schleiss 2010) . EBV is associated with a wide spectrum of cancers such as Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, smooth muscle tumours and HIV (Cohen et al. 2011) . Thus, developing vaccines against EBV provides substantial benefits to human public health. However, no attempt for EBV vaccine development has achieved desirable outcome. For instance, vaccines against EBV glycoprotein gp350 (a common strategy for EBV vaccine development) failed to protect against EBV infection but did reduce the incidence of infectious mononucleosis (IM) by 78% (Sokal et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, establishing cells infectible by a broad range of viruses provides opportunities for producing vaccines against viruses that lack robust culture models. For example, primary cultures of human hepatocytes (PHH) are the primary in vitro model for HBV infection which, however, do not expand in culture, and have limited life span and supply (Zeisel et al. 2015) . HepaRG cells can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells following a DMSO-mediated differentiation process, which are susceptible to HBV infection and support HBV cccDNA production. However, the differentiation process is time-consuming that may affect experiment reproducibility and reduce the infection efficiency. It was demonstrated that NTCP, a specific receptor mediating HBV infection, can increase cells' susceptibility to HBV, and hepatoma cell lines overexpressing NTCP could sensitize cells to HBV infection (Somiya et al. 2016 ).

Thus, selection of the appropriate family member of integrins and LDLR for the PRP is a critical and challenging task. Genetic modulation to enable expression of multiple receptors on the cell membrane with correct folding and modification imposes further concerns. One could, of course, modify genetically the cell line by introducing the receptors of the PRP sequentially (one by one) or use one (all-in-one) expression plasmid to introduce them as a whole. However, the former approach is time-consuming and challenged by the limited number of available selection markers especially when the construction of a plethora of receptors (e.g. separate expression of multiple domains of one receptor) was necessary; the latter approach is sometimes not feasible if the sequences encoding the receptors were too large (plasmid stability issues) that imposes a big challenge to cell transfection.

PRRs play differential roles on viral identification, i.e. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3/7/8/9 recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) including RIG-I and MDA5 detect RNA structures, DNA sensors such as cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, DAI and a few DNA damage response proteins identify cytoplasmic DNA (O'Neill and Bowie 2010; Unterholzner 2013; Hornung 2014; Muller et al. 2019) . Viruses have established various strategies to evade host antiviral responses. Take HSV-1 as the example, its tegument protein kinase US3 could reduce TLR3 expression to dampen TLR3-mediated antiviral response (Peri et al. 2008 ); its tegument protein UL36 could block IFN-beta production via deubiquitinating TRAF3 (a crucial component of the RLR-mediated pathway) (Wang et al. 2013) ; and by somewhat unknown mechanism HSV-1 infection could affect the stability and functionality of STING, an important adaptor for type I IFN induction by cytosolic DNA (Kalamvoki and Roizman 2014) . Antiviral restriction factors, such as APOBEC3G, SAMHD1, Tetherin/BST-2 and TRIM5a are important components of the first line of host defense (reviewed in Kluge et al. 2015; Colomer-Lluch et al. 2018) . Generally, they are interferon-inducible proteins that block viral replication and propagation. These molecular mechanisms, developed by viruses to target the host defense system, can be utilized to artificially block the host antiviral responses through expressing, for example, the inhibitors of PRR signalling or by knocking down the expression of the antiviral restriction factors. Recently, one such attempt was made through a genome-wide screening of the host genes important for poliovirus (PV), IAV and RV replication, followed by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) knock-down of the selected identified genes (Murray et al. 2017) . Using a panel of 12 different viruses, it was shown that inhibition of the selected host genes allowed for overcoming antiviral defenses and increasing host cells' (Vero and Hep-2) permissiveness and viral replication. Thus, it might be possible to create a universal or semi-universal cell line. One strategy to achieve this goal could be a combination of two approaches-modification of the pro-and anti-viral genes together with the expression of the panel of receptors preferred by various viruses. However, artificially establishing a favourable cellular environment for viral invasion is not an easy task as it has to enable concomitant expression of multiple suppressors against various cellular defense pathways under precise time and spatial control without disrupting cell homeostasis. An alternative and, perhaps, more practical strategy, which we propose here, is to select cell lines with low and well-characterized innate immune profile as the starting material for developing a cell model that is susceptible to a broad range of viruses and genetically modify them with the PRP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 316, "text": "(Li et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 317, "end": 333, "text": "Chew et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 676, "end": 700, "text": "(O'Neill and Bowie 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 701, "end": 719, "text": "Unterholzner 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 720, "end": 733, "text": "Hornung 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 734, "end": 753, "text": "Muller et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 966, "end": 983, "text": "(Peri et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1140, "text": "(Wang et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1339, "text": "(Kalamvoki and Roizman 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1515, "text": "Kluge et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1542, "text": "Colomer-Lluch et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2179, "text": "(Murray et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technical obstacles impose challenges for constructing cells that can be infected by a broad range of viruses"}, {"text": "A growing number of evidence suggested that hostand virus-specific interactions of viral molecules with the host innate immune system are determinants of virus-host range and virulence (Rothenburg and Brennan 2019) .
