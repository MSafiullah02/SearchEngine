            "text": "Influenza virus A, subtype H5N1 infects birds and has been thought to have limited zoonotic potential and public health significance. In 1997, with the emergence and spread of the new Asian lineage H5N1 virus, this assumption has changed dramatically, as this virus is able to infect a broad spectrum of non-avian species, including humans (Capua and Alexander, 2007). Viruses of the genus influenza A in the family of Orthomyxoviridae are grouped into 16 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H1\u201316) according to their reactivity in serological tests (haemagglutination inhibition test) and into nine neuraminidase (NA) subtypes (N1\u20139). The eight single-stranded RNA segments of the influenza A virus genome encode 11 viral proteins. According to their virulence, avian influenza viruses are categorised into two groups: highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), which cause high mortality approaching 100% in chickens, and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), which cause mild respiratory diseases in poultry (Deregt et al., 2006, Alexander, 2007). Infection with HPAIV, generally caused by strains of subtypes H5 and H7, results in high economic losses in the poultry industry. Retrospective studies have shown that domestic poultry plays a substantial role in generating novel influenza A virus strains with the capacity to cross the species barrier (Capua and Alexander, 2007, Yang et al., 2008). The recent HPAIV H5N1 virus has been transmitted occasionally from fowl to human, and a few human-to-human transmissions (family clusters) have been reported. Until August 2010, 505 human cases were laboratory confirmed, 300 of which (59%) had a fatal outcome (WHO, 2010).",

            "text": "Laboratory diagnosis of influenza is essential for surveillance, treatment and vaccine development (Petric et al., 2006). The diagnosis of HPAIV H5 generally includes conventional virus culture followed by serological differentiation but also may include rapid and more cost-effective technologies that allow for the detection of subtype-specific viral antigens or nucleic acids. For the diagnosis of HPAIV H5 infections in humans, the WHO recommended RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR or other molecular methods, such as rapid antigen detection systems or so-called point-of-care testing and virus culture (WHO, 2007). Commercially available rapid antigen detection systems can, in principle, be used at the point of care, even by untrained personnel without laboratory equipment, and provide results within 15\u201330 min. However, point-of-care tests (generally lateral flow tests) vary greatly in their sensitivity and specificity, and laboratory confirmation of reactive samples is required (Beigel et al., 2005, Petric et al., 2006, Chan et al., 2007, Cui and Tong, 2008). Direct comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of the available point-of-care tests is difficult due to variable conditions for test evaluations. Preliminary results showed a poor clinical sensitivity by commercial rapid antigen detection systems for the diagnosis of avian influenza (AI) in patients. Furthermore, some of the tests detect several subtypes of influenza A viruses and are therefore not H5-specific (Chotpitayasunondh et al., 2005, Chan et al., 2007, Ghebremedhin et al., 2009). It has been suggested that these tests should be used only in situations with a high risk of avian influenza and when high viral loads are expected, and lateral flow ELISA tests are not recommended for surveillance programs (Charlton et al., 2009).",

Stocks from H1N1, H3N2, H5N2, H5N6, and all H5N1 isolates, H7N1, and influenza B viruses were produced on MDCK monolayers, whereas subtypes H2, H5, and H7-H16 were propagated in embryonated eggs. The virus was harvested either from allantoic fluid or cell supernatant. For the latter, the cells were scratched and centrifuged with the cell supernatant at 4,500 \u00d7 \ng (Multifuge 3 S-R, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany) for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant or the allantoic fluid was collected, inactivated with beta-propiolactone (Ferak Berlin, Berlin, Germany), and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Inactivation was performed with an ice-cold dilution of beta-propiolactone (1:10 in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The virus material was mixed thoroughly with beta-propiolactone. The pH of the mix was adjusted to a value between 7.4 and 8.4. The solution was stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. Inactivation was verified by infection of cells or eggs. Neither cytopathic effects in cell culture nor HA activity in the allantoic fluid or supernatant were observed after four passages. Furthermore, an H5N1-specific TaqMan-PCR was negative in such samples, proving the inactivation of virus. Only inactivated viruses were used for ELISA, western blot, and for the immunisation of mice under bio-safety level (BSL)-2 conditions. Virus quantitation of infectious materials was performed by HA assay (egg-grown virus) or by plaque tests on MDCK cells. In the case of infectious HPAIV H5, virus propagation and experiments were performed in a BSL 3 laboratory. The specific reaction of the generated mAbs was further tested with 16 different respiratory viruses, 10 enteroviruses (Table 1), and 16 bacteria causing influenza-like symptoms in humans (Table 2\n).",

Deducing from a calculation based on the protein sequence alone, using a web-based application for the calculation of molecular weights and glycosylation sites from ExPASy (http://us.expasy.org/), it was expected that a shift of the HA0 band by \u223c20 kDA for the respective H5 isolate would be seen. After PNGase F treatment, the molecular weight of HA0 protein was reduced from \u223c75 kDa to \u223c55 kDA, as hypothesised. This observation confirmed that mAbs reacted with conformational epitopes on the HA protein separated under non-reducing conditions, and that the binding reactions of the antibody and antigen were not affected by deglycosylation (Fig. 2b).",

This project was initiated because there was a growing demand for the improvement of commercially available test kits for diagnostics of H5N1 in human samples. Available rapid antigen detection systems either did not discriminate between influenza A virus subtypes or showed a low sensitivity, leading to such tests having questionable suitability for routine application in the clinical setting (Chan et al., 2007, Rouleau et al., 2009, Ghebremedhin et al., 2009). Ideally, rapid antigen detection tests would have a high sensitivity for detection of H5N1 virus and would also be able to differentiate between subtypes (Chan et al., 2007). Compared to polyclonal antibodies, mAbs offer the unique advantages of increased specificity, unlimited availability, and consistent properties that may be exploited for diagnostic applications (Yang et al., 2008, Oh et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The immunisation strategy is one of the most important steps for the generation of antibodies to detect native antigens. Different approaches for the immunisation of mice with influenza viruses were reported: immunisation with Bromelain-purified BHA (Russ et al., 1987), recombinant antigens (He et al., 2007, Yang et al., 2008), formaldehyde-treated whole virus (Huang et al., 2007), or \u03b3-irradiated immunogen (Oh et al., 2009). It is known that epitopes of virus fixed in formaldehyde can be altered and therefore can induce mAbs, which do not react with native antigenic determinants (Duque et al., 1989). Beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated virus was chosen for the immunisation used here on the basis of the following rationale: BPL preserves viruses close to their native structure and interacts preferentially with the viral genome (Wainberg et al., 1971) Surface proteins remain intact, which induces the production of mAbs against both linear and conformational epitopes. Mice that were immunised twice with this antigen preparation produced a long-lasting, stable titre. Furthermore, it was predicted that immunisation with whole virions would result in the generation of mAbs against the main surface protein haemagglutinin. After the fusion and application of a staged selection system, 10 of 11 mAbs were achieved that target the HA protein, which represents about 35% of the total viral protein of human influenza virus (Oxford et al., 1981). Only one mAb reacted against a linear epitope of the viral matrix protein (M1 protein), which is associated with the inner membrane of the virion.",

No viruses or bacteria other than influenza A were recognised by the mAbs by indirect ELISA. The majority of the antibodies were specific for H5 strains, whereas four mAbs (107/1/E4, 140/1/D9, 10/1/D6, and 20/1/E6) also reacted with other influenza virus A subtypes, suggesting that there was binding to conserved epitopes. In a previous report using ELISA, none of four mAbs generated against a distinct H5N1 isolate detected H5 viruses that were isolated before the isolate was used for immunisation (Oh et al., 2009). It is suggested that the HA proteins of H5 viruses have changed significantly since the first isolation of this virus more than 30 years ago and that, therefore, the mAbs directed against recent H5N1 viruses do not bind to earlier H5 virus isolates. However, the present study revealed that three of the antibodies with a broader reaction pattern (20/1/E6, 107/1/E4, and 140/1/D9), as well as five H5-specific mAbs (1/03/F2, 23/3/G5, 132/03/D8, 157/1/F4, and 492/3/E6), were able to detect recent as well as older H5 isolates (e.g., A/Chicken/Scotland/59). Thus, it is assumed that stable epitopes are present on the HA protein of H5 strains, confirming observations published earlier by Vare\u010dkov\u00e1 et al. (2008). With one exception, all of the antibodies detected both clade 1 and clade 2.2 H5N1 isolates, indicating that these mAbs react broadly with circulating H5 viruses. Western blot analysis suggested that 10 mAbs react with conformational HA epitopes, as they detect HA under non-reducing conditions only, whereas the one antibody that reacts with the M1 protein, 10/1/D6, detects a linear epitope, as it worked under reducing and non-reducing conditions. To verify the binding of the mAbs with the HA protein, PNGase F was used for deglycosylation of the haemagglutinin. The level of glycosylation of the HA protein can vary significantly between virus strains and can thus have a considerable impact on the molecular weight of the glycoprotein (Harvey et al., 2008). Previous reports have shown the altered migration characteristics for deglycosylated HA1/HA2 proteins after denaturation and under reducing conditions (Harvey et al., 2008, Li et al., 2010). As expected, enzyme treatment resulted in a smaller-sized, faster-migrating HA protein, and a band shift from \u223c75 kDa to \u223c55 kDa was demonstrated, confirming that the generated mAbs detected exclusively the protein backbone of the HA molecule.",

In general, there was a good correlation regarding antibody specificity between the three immunological assay systems used. Differences in epitope recognition must be expected because availability of the antigenic sites is probably dependent on the test system used. It has long been known that antigen conformation on a solid phase appears to be different from one in solution (Vaidya et al., 1985). On the one hand, a portion of injected material may have changed its conformation, which exposed immunogenic sites that are hidden on the native protein. On the other hand, there are sites which are exposed on the native protein but are masked when the antigen is adsorbed onto plastic surfaces and vice versa (Mierendorf and Dimond, 1983). While these are only conformational changes, in western blotting, the denaturation of proteins will lead to changes in antigen presentation and epitope accessibility, thereby affecting antigen\u2013antibody interaction.",

However, one mAb alone was not enough to detect all nine H5N1 isolates examined. To achieve this aim, different combinations of mAbs were evaluated using sandwich ELISA. Several mAb pairs were identified that detected all H5N1 viruses analysed, without any cross-reactions with other influenza viruses. This was of great significance for the intended application of generated mAbs in an H5N1-specific rapid antigen detection system. Moreover, established combinations of mAbs resulted in higher absorbance readings for some H5 viruses, suggesting that combined mAbs were directed to different epitopes on the virus particles. These findings are in agreement with previous studies and have confirmed that mAb combinations can be used to increase ELISA sensitivity (He et al., 2007).",

According to their instruction leaflets, available tests generally have a sensitivity of \u22651 HA (WHO, 2005). Importantly, the results of the established sandwich ELISA showed that the detection limit for H5N1 virus can be improved to 0.04\u20130.05 HA (1 ng/ml), indicating the potential for increasing the sensitivity of rapid antigen detection tests. Furthermore, when using Poly-HRP40 conjugate instead of HRP-conjugated streptavidin, the detection limit was significantly improved, to 0.004\u20130.005 HA (0.1 ng/ml). Based on these results, it is expected that the application of the newly generated mAbs in rapid antigen detection tests using Poly-HRP40 conjugate would result in a 25- to 250-fold higher sensitivity of such an assay in comparison with the ones currently available. Prospective studies should be performed to test the generated antibodies with clinical samples to verify whether the sensitivity of the test systems might be influenced by sample matrices or by poor quality of the sample. Samples that are not collected appropriately may contain smaller amounts of virus and, thus, are associated with a lower sensitivity. The type of transport media is also important, as some of its components may influence the sensitivity of the test. In addition, a dilution of swabs for additional laboratory tests may also lead to negative rapid test results. Therefore, the authors suggest using at least one nasal swab, undiluted, directly for screening and a second swab (nasal or/and throat swab) in transport medium for further investigations, such as PCR or virus culture.",

Such systems are useful in clinical settings where fast assays guide physicians to make the best possible clinical decisions, for example, when a quarantine of infected patients is needed, followed by clinical and therapeutic monitoring. Next to the clinical application, the use of rapid antigen detection tests is desirable for community surveillance, in facility outbreaks and other epidemiological situations, in order to detect epidemiological trends (Rouleau et al., 2009).The discussion of rapid antigen detection systems mainly involves sensitivity and specificity. A recent evaluation of several test methods for the detection of the novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) confirm that both criteria remain questionable (Ginocchio et al., 2009, Vasoo et al., 2009, Sambol et al., 2010). The problems of sensitivity and specificity in rapid antigen detection systems remain, whether H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 viruses are present, and therefore, the need for better assays is essential. So far, the World Health Organization does not recommend the routine use of rapid tests alone for surveillance purposes or patient management without confirmatory testing (WHO, 2005, WHO, 2007, WHO, 2009).",
