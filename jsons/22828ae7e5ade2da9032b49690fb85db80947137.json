Of course, you may be thinking, \"The computer and the Internet are replacing books.\" Perhaps this will be true some day; certainly e-mail has replaced handwritten letters as a means of personal correspondence. We should all grieve this loss of civility and of what should become of valuable historical records. Imagine what would have happened if the correspondence of Thomas Jefferson and John and Abigail Adams had been via e-mail, read by the recipients and then deleted forever.",

However, the Internet could seldom provide the context of facts presented and the linguistic richness of books.

It was a simple maneuver involving moving the body to reposition particles in the inner ear canals. No surgery and no medication were needed. The technique came to be called the Epley maneuver and eventually involved a rotating, computer-controlled chair used to standardize movement of the patient. A 2006 investigative report in the Portland newspaper, The Oregonian, tells the reaction of Epley's colleagues: \"Inexplicably, they rejected him, heaved accusations that threatened his license to practice medicine.\" Today, however, the Epley chair is gaining acceptance, has garnered several million dollars in federal grants, and may be on its way to a medical clinic near you (4).",

He and his wife lived in a trailer about 40 minutes from our medical group's office. One day, not unexpectedly, his wife awoke to find that her husband had died at home during the night. As was local practice at the time, a physician was needed to go to the home to pronounce him dead. Our group had a designated \"house call\" physician each day, and this was not my day. My office schedule was full. What should I do? I kept seeing my scheduled patients and dispatched the \"house call\" doctor to my patient's home. He pronounced the patient dead, doing the job that needed to be done.",

Consider also the Berlin Medical Historical Museum in Germany and the Western Australia Medical Museum in Perth. Consult your guidebook and use the Internet to find these places as you travel. In the U.S, there is the Dittrick Medical History Center of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.

Ralph Waldo Emerson X. Oliver Wendell Holmes-Breakfast Table Series\" I have actually read some of Osler's recommended books. I recall that in high school, a Spanish teacher and mentor excused me from class for a few days so that I could read Cervantes' Don Quixote de la Mancha. I do my best to see a Shakespearean play each year. I have read bits and pieces of several of the other authors and works recommended. Inspired by Osler, I hereby humbly offer a list of 12 recommended books. Yes, my list has two more books than Osler's, but it is, after all, a century later. I chose these books from the Bibliography that follows this chapter, and hence some are reference works. My recommended books all have to do with medical history, and some incidentally present epistemology and moral values in a medical context. A few of these read like mystery novels, some are inspirational, and all tell facts we physicians should know. Here is the list, with some annotations: \u2022 Ackerknecht EH. History and Geography ofthe Most Important Diseases. New York, NY: Hafner; 1972. This is a manageable book (210 pages, including the index) that traces the demographics of the major communicable diseases, plus deficiency diseases, diseases of unknown origin, and more. \u2022 Bordley J. Two Centuries ofAmerican Medicine, 1776-1976. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders; 1976. A reference work of 844 pages, Two Centuries traces medical history from the founding of the United States until its bicentennial in 1976, the year of the book's publication. \u2022 Cartwright FF. Disease and History: The Influence of Disease in Shaping the Great Events ofHistory. New York, NY: Crowell; 1972. This readable book does just what the subtitle promises. It traces the influence of disease-such as typhus, syphilis, and the Black Death-on events in world history. \u2022 Dirckx JH. The Language of Medicine: Its Evolution, Structure, and Dynamics. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Praeger; 1983. Perhaps I am assuming an elitist posture, but of all the medical word origin books available, I prefer this one for its scholarly approach. Dirckx discusses medical words in the context of our classical traditions, historical curiosities, modern coinages, slang, and jargon. \u2022 Durham RH. Encyclopedia ofMedical Syndromes. New York, NY: Harper and Brothers; 1960. Ifyou want to know about the \"stiff-man\" syndrome, egg-white syndrome, or bullous malignant erythema multiforme syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), this is the place to look. Virtually all the popular and lesser-known eponymous diseases are here. \u2022 Garrison FH. History of Medicine. 4th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders; 1929. Garrison's is the \"Bible\" of medical history books. In my opinion, it is still unequaled in scholarship. Would you believe that as a young physician, I read this 996-page book cover to cover? My well-worn copy bears the underlining to support this claim. \u2022 Marti-Ibanez F. A Prelude to Medical History. New York, NY: MD Pub-",
