            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in humans in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002 and subsequently spread to other continents early the following year (Chan-Yeung & Yu, 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003). Shortly after the spread of the virus beyond China the causative agent was quickly identified as being a species of coronavirus (SARS coronavirus) that was previously unknown (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003). Indeed, the proteins of SARS coronavirus had such low amino acid identity with those of known coronaviruses that it has been tentatively assigned to a new coronavirus group 4. The three existing coronavirus groups (Table 1) were initially devised on the basis of a lack of antigenic relationships between the species of different groups (Pedersen et al., 1978; S\u00e1nchez et al., 1990; Enjuanes et al., 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003). It is probable that the vast majority of the human population is susceptible to SARS coronavirus. The SARS epidemic was contained at \u2018only\u2019 8460 cases by the enormous effort, and sacrifice, of a large number of individuals associated with many public authorities. So severe were the infections, in a fully susceptible population, that 808 died; doubtless a greater proportion would have died had it not been for the medical attention focussed upon them. Sadly, a large proportion of the deaths in some countries were sustained by health care workers. In addition to the human misery, there were dire economic consequences for those countries most affected.\n",

The disease might arise again by further transmission from the suspected animal reservoir, or transmission from human, possibly asymptomatic, carriers. There is evidence from studies of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and feline coronavirus that coronaviruses establish persistent infections. Chicks that had been experimentally infected with IBV at 1 day of age re-excreted virus at around 19 weeks of age (Jones & Ambali, 1987). It is suspected that the stressor of the start of egg production caused the release of the virus. Approximately 10% of cats that had been naturally infected with feline coronavirus became asymptomatic carriers, excreting virus for over 1 year (Addie & Jarrett, 2001; Addie et al., 2003). Others excreted virus for periods of several months.",

It is the major respiratory virus of the chicken (the domestic fowl), as it is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. Its host range is considered to be limited to the chicken (Cavanagh & Naqi, 2003), although genetically very similar coronaviruses cause disease in turkeys (enteric disease; Guy, 2000; Cavanagh et al., 2001) and pheasants (respiratory and kidney disease; Lister et al., 1985; Gough et al., 1996; Cavanagh et al., 2002). IBV occurs globally, both in chickens kept on a large and a small scale (Wunderwald & Hoop, 2002). It exists as scores of serotypes/genotypes (Cavanagh, 2001; Meulemans et al., 2001; Farsang et al., 2002), which are problematic with regard to prophylaxis.",

Recently a strain of IBV has been associated with disease of the proventriculitis (the cranial glandular compartment of the stomach, adjacent to the gizzard, which is the caudal muscular compartment) (Yu et al., 2001a). Nephritis is not uncommon in a proportion of naturally IBV-infected meat-type birds, environmental factors playing a role. Some IBV strains are intrinsically nephropathogenic; that is, they reproducibly cause nephritis when inoculated experimentally into specific pathogen free chickens (Lambrechts et al., 1993; Pensaert & Lambrechts, 1994; Cook et al., 2001; Li & Yang, 2001).

It does not contain a haemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein such as is found in group 2 coronaviruses. The coronavirus S protein is a dimer or trimer (Cavanagh, 1983; Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Lewicki & Gallagher, 2002). The S glycopolypeptide of IBV, like that of group 2 coronaviruses, is cleaved into amino-terminal S1 (approximately 520 amino acid residues) and carboxy-terminal S2 (approximately 625 residues) glycopolypeptides (Lai & Cavanagh, 1997). The IBV S protein has been demonstrated to be a determinant of the host cell range in vitro. When the S protein gene of an infectious cDNA clone of the Beaudette strain (Casais et al., 2001), which replicates in mammalian Vero and BHK cells, was replaced by that of the M41 strain, which does not replicate in those cell lines, the recombinant virus was unable to replicate in them (Casais et al., 2003). The recombinant did replicate in primary chick kidney cells, as did both the Beaudette and M41 strains. Whether the S protein of IBV is a determinant of tissue tropism in vivo remains to be determined.",

An ultrastructural investigation revealed that the virus replicated in all segments of tubules and ducts, but more frequently in the epithelial cells of the collecting ducts, collecting tubules, distal convoluted tubules and Henle's loops (Chen, 1996). The extent of mortality is age related (greatest in chicks; Lambrechts et al., 1993) and varies according to the line of bird; for example, 18% and 44% of an egg layer-type bird and a meat-type bird, respectively (Pensaert & Lambrechts, 1994).",

Isolates differ in their extent of replication in the non-respiratory tissues, and some produce clinical disease in non-respiratory tissues, most notably the kidney and proventriculus. The pantropism of IBV might be the case for SARS coronavirus, as the latter has not only been associated with pneumonia, but also with diarrhoea (although it remains to be demonstrated whether the SARS virus is replicating in enteric tissues; Peiris et al., 2003). A point of difference is that whereas SARS virus is associated with severe clinical signs in both the respiratory and enteric tracts, IBV is usually limited to disease in the respiratory tract.",

It is the S1 subunit that induces virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody. This has been demonstrated in various ways: failure to induce VN by virus from which S1 had been removed (Cavanagh et al., 1986); induction of VN antibody by S1 released from virions by treatment with urea (Cavanagh et al., 1986), by non-ionic detergent, followed by affinity chromatography (Ignjatovic & Galli, 1994) and by expression from a vaccinia virus recombinant (Tomley et al., 1987); by production of monoclonal antibody-resistant mutants, the mutations being in the S1 part of the spike protein gene (Cavanagh et al., 1988; Koch et al., 1990; Kant et al., 1992).",

Protection is determined by challenge, 3 weeks after vaccination, the challenge virus being applied by the same route. Three main approaches to the assessment of protection have been: (1) observation of clinical signs (not commonly used); and removal of the trachea at 4 or 5 days after challenge followed by either (2) quantitative assessment of ciliary activity or (3) detection of live challenge virus, usually by inoculation of embryonated eggs. The second and third methods result in similar deductions being made as regards protection (Marquardt et al., 1982), although in some studies challenge virus was isolated from some individuals whose ciliary activity was unaffected or little affected. Arguably, declaring a chicken as non-protected because of the recovery of small amounts of challenge virus, when ciliary activity is normal, is being too stringent.",

Other challenge viruses, known now to differ by 20% or so in S1 from the virus used to initially infect the chickens, broke through immunity in 30 to 70% of cases (Rosenberger et al., 1976; Hofstad, 1981). Collectively these and other reports show that cross-protection can range from very poor to moderate (poor for commercial purposes), although in some cases the differences among these reports may be also be due to differences in stringency by which protection was assessed (discussed later). When Winterfield et al. (1976) used clinical criteria to assess cross-protection, a vaccinal strain of the Massachusetts serotype was concluded to protect all chickens (in groups of 10) against challenge with serotypes now known to differ by 20% or so in their S1 proteins. Protection was assessed as being less when re-isolation of challenge virus was used as the criterion for protection. There is no doubt that in the field the application of a vaccine that is homologous to the prevailing field strain has given better protection than an heterologous vaccine.",

Challenge with two variants (98% S1 identity with UK/6/82) resulted in challenge scores (a relative measure of retention of ciliary activity) virtually the same as with the homologous challenge. Challenge with two others isolates (96% and 98% S1 identity, respectively), resulted in a higher challenge score, indicative of less cross-protection, although the numbers were not statistically significantly different. Also, in three experiments one of each group of 10 birds initially inoculated with the UK/6/82 virus was clearly not protected against homologous challenge. The chickens had been individually inoculated with a high dose (5 to 6 log10 infectious virus) of the primary inoculum. Therefore, this lack of protection in 10% of birds was unlikely to have been due to a failure to initiate infection with the primary virus, but rather to heterogeneity of the immune response.",

            "text": "Clearly, the induction of protective immunity to IBV is complex. It not only depends on the antigenic relatedness of the primary infecting strain and a subsequent challenge strain, but also on the response of individual chickens; approximately 10% of chickens in some experiments failed to develop a protective immune response. Furthermore, while breeds of chicken are similar in that they are all efficiently infected by IBV, resulting in similar titres of virus, they differ in their capacity to clear the infection (Otsuki et al., 1990). Small (\u223c 5%) differences in S1 amino acids would appear to be sometimes responsible for poor cross-protection. It should be borne in mind that while the focus has been on the relatedness of the S1 protein, other viral proteins may have a role in protective immunity; for example, the nucleocapsid protein, of which more later. Recently, we (T. Hodgson, R. Casais, B. Dove, P. Britton & D. Cavanagh, manuscript in preparation) have substituted (swapped) the spike protein gene of our Beaudette infectious clone (receiver strain) with that of the M41 strain (donor strain). Both strains are of the Massachusetts serotype and have 95.0% S1 amino acid identity. The Beaudette and M41 strains are attenuated and pathogenic for chickens, respectively. When chickens were inoculated with the donor, receiver or spike-swapped recombinant IBV and challenged with M41, the receiver strain induced almost no tracheal protection (assessed by ciliary activity) while the recombinant IBV induced protection almost as good as the donor strain. This was not due to an increased virulence of the receiver strain, as the spike-swapped recombinant was as non-pathogenic as the Beaudette receiver strain, and both replicated poorly. As the receiver strain and recombinant virus had identical proteins except for the spike protein, it would appear that the poor immunity induced by the receiver strain against the donor strain was due to some of the 5.0% of amino acid differences (27 different residues) in S1. This supports the findings of earlier work that small differences in S1 can contribute to poor cross-protection (Cavanagh et al., 1997; Nix et al., 2000).",

(1989) continued with this IBV/E. coli infection, showing marked variation in mortality among several inbred lines of White Leghorn chickens. More detailed analysis of two of these lines, line 15I (highly susceptible) and line C (relatively resistant), showed that the rate of virus production and titres in the respiratory tract were similar during the first 4 days after infection (Otsuki et al., 1990). Thereafter, however, titres declined much more slowly in the susceptible line 15I, taking two-fold longer to decline to undetectable levels. In tracheal explants of the two lines there was no difference in the replication profile of the virus, showing that the difference in the birds themselves was not because of an intrinsic difference in the capacity of the trachea to support the replication of IBV.

VN antibody was delayed in comparison with ELISA-detected antibody, being first detected in the period 9 to 21 days after infection, peaking within 35 days and remaining level for the remainder of the sampling period (63 days after inoculation), although in 25% (2/8) of the birds the VN antibody was still increasing at 63 days, when sampling ended.
