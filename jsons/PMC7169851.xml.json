During mRNA synthesis, eukaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of critical modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm where they are translated into proteins. These processing events include the addition of a cap structure at the 5\u2032\u2010terminus, the splicing out of introns, the editing of specific nucleotides, and the acquisition of a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032\u2010terminus . The eukaryotic cap structure found at the 5\u2032\u2010end of mRNAs is critical for the splicing of the cap\u2010proximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation of mRNAs.1 Synthesis of the cap structure occurs co\u2010transcriptionnally on nascent mRNAs and involves three enzymatic reactions. First, an RNA 5\u2032\u2010triphosphatase hydrolyzes the gamma\u2010phosphate at the 5\u2032\u2010end of the nascent pre\u2010mRNA to generate a 5\u2032\u2010diphosphate end. Second, a RNA guanylyltransferase then transfers a GMP moiety to the diphosphate end of the RNA. Finally, using S\u2010adenosyl\u2010methionine as a co\u2010substrate, an RNA (guanine\u2010N7) methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group to the N\u20107 position of the guanine to produce the characteristic m7GpppRNA cap structure.2\n",

Human cells harbor a metal\u2010independent RNA triphosphatase (RTase) that belongs to the cysteine phosphatase family and catalyze a two\u2010step reaction involving a covalent cysteinyl\u2010phosphoenzyme intermediate.3 On the other hand, the RTases observed in protozoa, eukaryotic viruses, and fungi are completely different both structurally and mechanistically (Figure 1). Catalysis by these metal\u2010dependent enzymes involves the attack of a water molecule in close proximity to the gamma\u2010phosphate with no formation of a covalent intermediate. Therefore, the RNA triphosphatase represents an attractive target for the development of novel, potent and low off\u2010target effect antimicrobial drugs. Although no effective drugs are currently available against pathogenic RTase, their differences with the human RTase can be exploited to develop specific inhibitors. In addition to numerous viral families that encode RTases, other important human pathogens such as Candida albicans, Trypanosoma brucei, and the pathogenic malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum also encode RTases that could be targeted by antimicrobial drugs.",

Although experiments have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) does not significantly reduce metal\u2010dependent RTase activity, related compounds have demonstrated interesting inhibitory effects (Table 1). Two independent in vitro studies4,5 on Schizosaccharomyces pombe pcT1P and Chlorella virus cvRtp1 have revealed a reduction of the phosphohydrolase activity in the presence of pyrophosphate (PPi, K\ni = 400 and 2.4 \u00b5M, respectively). Further studies4, 5, 6 using tripolyphosphate (PPPi) have pointed out a greater inhibition of both the pcT1P and cvRtp1 enzymes (K\ni = 30 and 0.6 \u00b5M, respectively) as well as the RTase from West Nile Virus (NS3) which is also strongly inhibited by PPPi (K\ni = 40 nM). Biochemical studies have shown that cvRtp1 has a greater affinity for PPPi than its natural triphosphorylated RNA substrate.4 As cvRtp1 has a weak tripolyphosphatase activity, it is tempting to speculate that a non\u2010hydrolyzable PPPi analog would be even more potent. Although the inhibition of the human capping enzyme (HCE) by PPi and PPPi has not been reported, it has to be pointed out that phosphate analogs, such as the FDA\u2010approved anticytomegalovirus drug foscarnet, have already shown their efficiency in clinic.7 Although PPi and PPPi could not realistically be used as a drug, they could serve as lead compounds for the rational design of novel anti\u2010RTase drugs. Foscarnet is a succesful example of a PPi structural mimic which has demonstrated both good therapeutical safety and efficicacy. Therefore, a second generation of foscarnet\u2010based PPi or PPPi analogs can likely be envisioned to efficiently target the RTase of several pathogens.",

As the human capping enzyme is structurally and mechanistically different, namely by its inability to hydrolyze free nucleotides, it is tempting to speculate that those nucleotide analogs will not inhibit the RTase activity in the human capping enzyme. The use of such nucleotide analogs appears as an interesting strategy to inhibit microbial RTases as nucleotide analogs, often marketed as non\u2010phosphorylated prodrugs for better absorption and distribution, have already proven their efficiency against numerous diseases including cancer, autoimmunity, fungal, and viral infections.",

Although the K\ni values of those oxoanion compounds is not in the submicromolar range, the specificity that they harbor for cvRtp1 versus the two closely related Cet1 and D1 proteins is a demonstration that specific inhibition of RTase can also be achieved by using allosteric inhibitors targeting regions located outside of the RTase active site.",

For instance, recent in vitro studies have shown that foscarnet, an antiviral drug that targets the DNA polymerase of human cytomegalovirus, is a potent inhibitor of the GTase reaction.12 Its mechanism of action is purported to occur through substrate binding inhibition on account of its analogous nature to pyrophosphate (PPi), a product of both the polymerase as well as the RNA guanylyltransferase reaction. Ribavirin, a broad\u2010spectrum nucleoside analog approved by the FDA as an antiviral for severe respiratory syncytial virus, Hepatitis C, and other viral infections, is another example of a RNA polymerase inhibitor with pleiotropic activities.13 Its incorporation during strand synthesis, leading to chain termination or error catastrophe, is one of the modes of action of this antiviral.13 In its cellular triphosphorylated form, ribavirin can also be used as a substrate by viral GTases.14 However, RNAs capped with ribavirin are relatively inert to methylation by viral RNA (guanine\u2010N7) methyltransferases, thus resulting in mRNAs which are stable but not efficiently translated into viral proteins.14 The incorporation of ribavirin instead of guanine as a \u2018pseudo\u2010RNA cap\u2019 at the 5\u2032\u2010end of viral RNAs is a landmark demonstration that the viral RNA cap structure itself could act as an antimicrobial target. The use of guanine\u2010N7 methylation\u2010inert cap donor molecules could potentially prove to be an interesting line of research for the development of antimicrobial drugs. However, the ability to synthesize viral RNAs capped by nucleoside analogs in cells and, more importantly, the fate of these RNAs in the cells remain to be assessed. Inhibitors like foscarnet and ribavirin provide a strong basis for the rational design of antiviral drugs. However, on account of the possibility of off\u2010targets, the risk of major side effects remains. Several issues related to the specificity problem faced by ribavirin and other nucleoside analogs can likely be partially resolved by the development of non\u2010nucleoside inhibitors.",

For instance, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) harbors an unconventional RNA capping apparatus similar to that of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This capping apparatus differs from mammalian capping enzymes in terms of mechanistic and enzymatic properties.15 In VSV, the viral L protein first hydrolyzed GTP to GDP. Then, the 5\u2032\u2010RNA:GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase) activity of the enzyme transfers the 5\u2032\u2010phosphorylated viral mRNA\u2010start sequence (L\u2010pRNA) to GDP to generate the capped Gpp\u2010pRNA .16 Liuzzi et al., have effectively designed non\u2010nucleoside competitive inhibitors exhibiting high potency against the capping apparatus of RSV.17 In fact, these inhibitors are large polycyclic aromatic molecules which were initially designed against the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase activity of the RSV L protein which also harbors the viral RNA capping enzymatic activity. The use of these non\u2010nucleoside inhibitors leads to the formation of triphosphorylated prematurely terminated RNAs in antiviral assays, by preventing the guanylylation of nascent transcripts, thus effectively targeting the viral RNA capping mechanism rather than the polymerase reaction.17 This class of inhibitors could be a vital starting point for the development of new drugs directed against the RNA capping enzyme of RSV. Therefore, this aforementioned study by Liuzzi and colleagues underlines a major avenue for the design and implementation of drugs directed against RSV.

The most promising avenue of research with regards to the RNA capping machinery for the development of antifungal and antiprotozoan agents is potentially to target essential subunit interactions within the RNA capping complex. In most eukaryotes, the recruitment of the capping machinery to the RNA Pol II pre\u2010initiation complex is dependent on the phosphorylation status of the carboxy\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of the polymerase.19 Moreover, in several micro\u2010organisms, such as S. cerevisiae, the proper recruitment of the various enzymes involved in RNA capping is also fundamentally dependent on protein\u2013protein interactions.20 These interactions not only ensure the presence of the RNA capping machinery in close proximity to the nascent mRNAs, but are also important for the optimal activity and stability of each protein involved in the RNA capping machinery. For instance, in the budding yeast capping machinery, the GTase binds to the phosphorylated CTD, whereas the RTase enzyme lacks this property. However, the interaction of the RTase with the GTase guides the RTase to the site of RNA transcription.20 Inhibitors targeting this interaction could prove to be vital for the development of highly selective antifungal agents. Alternatively, as distinct phosphorylation events of the RNA Pol II CTD are associated with RNA capping subunits recruitment, inhibitors targeting the protein\u2013CTD interface could be an interesting line of research for antifungal development. On account of the different functional organization of the capping subunits in mammalian cells and unicellular organisms, side effects would likely be minimal. However, it should be pointed out that such a strategy might not be useful to target the capping machinery of some organisms. For instance, in C. albicans and related species, the interaction between the various subunits of the capping machinery is not a pre\u2010requisite for their recruitment to the RNA Pol II initiation complex as they independently interact with the phosphorylated CTD.20 Therefore, only inhibitors targeting the binding of RNA capping subunits to the phosphorylated CTD of the RNA Pol II complex would be of any antimicrobial significance for certain microbial species.",

Several innovative approaches spanning from in silico molecular docking to high throughput in vitro screening of library of molecules have been used to define and design molecules of potential antiflaviviral significance. Virtual screening by 2D similarity searching, pharmacophore filtering, and molecular docking for competitive inhibitors of the SAM\u2010binding site in the NS5 protein of Dengue virus, followed by subsequent in vitro bioassay studies, have led to the identification of a potent inhibitor (Compound 7, IC50 = 60 \u00b5M), bearing a novel molecular scaffold, which essentially consists of a linear connection of two simple aromatic cores with a branched cyclic hydrocarbon through amide and carboxylic linkages. The specificity of Compound 7 has not been addressed yet.32 The identification of this novel molecular scaffold bearing a strong affinity to the ligand binding site of the NS5 MTase domain could represent in itself a strong lead for the development of novel antiflaviviral therapeutics. The combination of in silico and biochemical experimentation was also used for the identification of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as another novel\u2010scaffold high potency inhibitor of the RNA methyltransferase reaction catalyzed by the West Nile Virus (IC50 = 4.2 \u00b5M) and the Dengue virus (IC50 = 2.3 \u00b5M) NS5 proteins.33 Of noteworthy interest, ATA has also been recently shown to be a potent inhibitor or the SARS\u2010coronavirus methyltransferases nsp14 (IC50 = 6.4 \u00b5M) and nsp10/16 (IC50 = 2.1 \u00b5M).34 However, the specificity of ATA still needs to be addressed.

These inhibitors targeted both the RNA\u2010binding and SAM\u2010binding sites and thus, laid the basis for a potential multi\u2010drug approach for the treatment of flaviviral infections. However, no study pertaining to the relative toxicity of these compounds has yet been made available in order to provide an indication of their relative potency as a lead for drug design.",
