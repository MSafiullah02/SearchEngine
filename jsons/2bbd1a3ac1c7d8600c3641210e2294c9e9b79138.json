Pseudoknot is one type of RNA structures that cannot be modeled with Context Free Grammars (CFG) because it exhibits crossing dependencies. Pseudoknot structures have functional importance since they appear, for example, in viral genome RNAs and ribozyme active sites. Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) is one example of a grammatical model that is more expressive than CFG and has the capability of dealing with crossing dependencies. In this paper, we describe a new inference algorithm for TAG RNA, a sub-model of TAG. We also introduce an RNA structure identification framework, TAG RNA Inf, within which the TAG RNA inference algorithm constitutes the core of the training phase. We present the results of using the proposed framework for identifying RNA sequences with pseudoknot structures. Our results outperform those reported in [14] for the same problem that employs a different grammatical formalism.",

This is partly due to the discovery of many new functional RNAs, such as miRNAs and tmRNAs [3] [16] [29] . Another factor that has led to the speeding up of RNA structural research is the rise of the RNA World Hypothesis [9] which suggests that the current DNA and protein world has evolved from an RNA based world. This Hypothesis is supported by the fact that RNA can carry genetic information like DNA and it is capable of catalyzing reactions like proteins (rRNA). Genetic information of some existent viruses is carried in RNA form [15] . Since the function of bimolecular sequences depends on its structure, analyzing RNA structures is essential to create new drugs and understand genetic diseases [6] [20] . Computational methods can provide less expensive solutions to structure analysis than other methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray crystallography.",

He suggested the use of formal grammars as a tool to model and analyze DNA, RNA, and proteins. The use of grammars has attracted the attention of many researchers [7] [26] because it can model long range interactions. In addition, grammatical models are concise and easy to understand representation of structures of sequence families. Thus, it is considered to be a natural analytical approach to fully understanding the structure and properties of these sequences. Results for secondary structure prediction and multiple sequence alignment agree with and sometimes suggest improvements over traditional methods [21] .",

Sakakibara has published [22] in which he discusses the general merits of using grammatical inference in bioinformatics. Brazma et. al. [5] have proposed an approach to discover simple grammars for families of biological sequences. The grammatical formalisms they use are subclasses of regular patterns. On the use of grammatical inference to analyze RNA structures with Pseudoknots, Laxminarayana et. al. [13] presented an inference algorithm for Terminal Distinguishable Even Linear Grammars (TDELG), and they have shown how to use this algorithm in an Infer-Test model for the detection of a pseudoknot structure in an RNA sequence. The experimental results they presented [14] show 54% sensitivity when using 50% of the RNA sample for training. The sensitivity rises to 85% only when 90% of the sample is used for training. Specificity was not reported. This is the same problem as the one we address, and our results outperform those numbers, as it will be shown. Takakura et. al. have published [24] in which they give a linear time algorithm for generating probabilistic TAG RNA from alignment data. They use the inferred grammar to find new members of nc-RNA families, which is a different problem from the one we address in this paper.",

In ESLTAG, the adjoining operation can occur only at internal nodes tagged with the symbol *, and the number of these nodes is restricted. TAG RNA is a sub-class of ESLTAG where only five types of elementary trees are allowed (Fig. 2) 1 . Each type of tree is responsible for a specific kind of branching or structural form that an RNA sequence can have. In the training phase, the inference algorithm is fed with a positive training set with structural information. The algorithm will generate a grammar for the provided sample. Then, the same sample along with a negative sample and the grammar generated by the inference algorithm will go through a TAG parser. For each input sequence the TAG parser will output a score. These scores will be the input to a threshold function inference module. The inferred threshold function will be used in the identification phase.",

If we look at the types of trees in TAG RNA , illustrated in Fig. 2 , we notice the following. First, there is only one type of initial tree which is of TYPE 1. Thus the generated grammar will always have one of those trees. TYPE 2 trees can be used to model dependent pairs of substrings ( x , x r ) that appear on opposite sides of \u03b5. TYPE 3 trees can be used to model dependent pairs of substrings ( x , x r ) that appear on the same side of \u03b5. Finally, TYPE 4 trees can be used to model independent substrings (loops in the RNA structure) that are represented by w symbols in the generated pattern. As we mentioned above, we currently support patterns that have exactly one \u03b5 symbol. TYPE 5 trees can be used to model more complex structures with branching.

If there is more than one possible structure, due to the nondeterministic nature of the grammar, the parser will output the maximum score. As mentioned in section 3.2.3, a separate grammar for each pattern resulting from the positive training will be generated. The score for a certain sequence under the union of a set of grammars will, again, be the maximum of the scores generated from all grammars in the set. The parser we used is an implementation of Rajasekaran's [17] and Vijay-Shankar and Joshi's [27] algorithms with some minor modifications. In our implementation of the TAG parser, in addition to n 4 matrix, A, maintained by the parser, we associate a list of 4-tuples with every node in the grammar. For a node \u03b1, a tuple (i,j,k,l) \u2208 List(\u03b1) iff \u03b1 \u2208 A(i,j,k,l). This idea, borrowed from [17] , does not improve the worst time complexity of the parser which is O(n 6 ); however, it improves the average run time in practice due to sparsity of the matrix A.

This is achieved through calculating a function S for all possible paths of Th from l = 0 to l = n, where S is the maximum gain in specificity -loss in sensitivity resulting from each step the function Th makes and n is the maximum sequence size. Then Th is constructed by tracing back the path resulting in maximum S. Calculating maximum S can be done in O(n 3 m 2 ) time and O(n 2 m 2 ) memory using dynamic programming, where m is maximum reported score for the input sample.",

Instead of inferring the threshold function from the maximum score calculated over all the generated grammars, we try all possible combinations out of these grammars and pick the combination that generates the maximum sensitivity + specificity for the training set. This approach has two advantages. First, it eliminates the least informative and/or nearly redundant grammars. Meanwhile it enhances the time performance for the identification phase by reducing the number of grammars, or in other words, the size of the overall grammar. This idea can further be used to restrict the number of grammars used to preset a maximum; thus choosing the best combination out of three or four grammars, for example. Even though trying out all possible combinations requires exponential time in the number of grammars, the number of grammars is usually small, resulting in the feasibility of this solution.",

The list links is simply constructed by scanning the pattern once and filling the corresponding entries for each xi and xi r in links as they are scanned in the pattern. Thus, the time required for generating links is O(n), where n is the number of stems in the pattern. A simple search on links is performed to determine the position of \u03b5 which satisfies the above condition. This also requires linear time in the length of the pattern and consequently linear in the number of stems n. Thus, the total time required for this phase of the algorithm is O(n).",
