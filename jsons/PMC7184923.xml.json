Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is major involved virus, but also other respiratory viruses are able to cause bronchiolitis (1). Some infants that require hospital admission for bronchiolitis will present recurrent wheezing episodes later in life (2). Up to now, there has not been an agreement on bronchiolitis definition concerning the upper age limit, which varies between 12 and 24 months (3, 4). Growing evidences suggest that the upper age limit should be restricted to 6 months (5). We retrospectively analyzed clinical differences between 0\u20136 months and 6\u201312 months old infants, among our cohort of 824 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis at the Pediatric Emergency Department, \u201cSapienza\u201d University of Rome, during eleven epidemic seasons.",

The definition of bronchiolitis as the first episode of acute viral wheeze occurring in infants less than two years, likely overlaps the early presentation of asthma or bronchial hyper-responsiveness (5). Moreover, bronchiolitis is a frequent and costly disease with mainly supportive treatment. Many studies have been made with the aim of finding other therapies, with controversial results (6).
