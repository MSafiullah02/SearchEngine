Our findings could provide understanding of chest morphometry of COVID-19 pneumonia and a helpful path toward improving of clinical strategies against the disease.",

The follow-up CT 5 days later showed progressive GGOs in right upper lobe, and new lesions in left upper lobe, with consolidation and fibrosis in both lungs. The diameter of the largest lesion was 6.7 cm and 46% of lung was involved. Five days later, his procalcitonin level was 0.13 ng/ml and his lactate dehydrogenase level was 1202 U/L. In another 5 days, his symptoms suddenly worsened, and his blood oxygen saturation decreased to 45%. Despite chest compression and adrenaline injection, he died.",

The diameter of the largest lesion was 6.7 cm. Approximately 4.3% of his lung volume was involved. One week later, he was admitted to the hospital for continued fatigue, fever, and hemoptysis. His blood oxygen saturation was 62%, and he received bedside endotracheal intubation. His condition quickly worsened with a procalcitonin level of 0.59 ng/ml, plasma cytokines IL6 of 340.40 pg/ml, and lactate dehydrogenase of 1196 U/L.

Extensive GGOs and pulmonary consolidation on chest CT suggested acute respiratory distress syndrome and massive lung infections with alveolar damage. In the second patient, the CT scan and laboratory studies initially showed evidence of only mild disease. However, the disease developed rapidly. Excessive immune responses led to severe pulmonary damage, potential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and eventual death. Based on these observations, if the chest CT suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome, the prognosis is guarded. In contrast, if the chest CT shows only minor pulmonary inflammation, laboratory results (eg, proinflammatory cytokines) should be carefully monitored.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and by March 21 the WHO's website announced 292,142 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 12,784 deaths world-wide (4).
