Using Google search results for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as examples, Morahan [12] argued that the overall quality of online health information is a serious concern for people because virtual access to high-quality health information is counterbalanced by high access to inaccurate and even fraudulent information. A systematic review on the quality of health information has found that 70% of studies on this subject have had concerns about the quality of crowdsourced health information. In fact, even too much information affects patients, making them even more confused because they find it harder to distinguish between true and inaccurate health information [13].",

Similar to our study, Tsai et al [14] investigated social networking websites on consumer health and found that more than half of user-generated health information was incomplete or erroneous. Looking at drug information on Wikipedia, a different type of information source, Clauson et al [15] also found that there are more omission errors and less completeness in Wikipedia articles than Medscape Drug Reference articles. Consistent with these studies, we show the existence of inaccurate online information. Unlike previous research, however, this study adds to the literature by demonstrating heterogeneous inaccuracy between geospecific online health communities and objective hospital ratings, and by further delving into the offline determinants of such heterogeneity. To the best of our knowledge, no previous empirical study has taken this approach.",

Korea is no exception in this issue. Antibiotic prescribing behavior has changed after quality assessment of prescriptions were done, including those for antibiotics for treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infections in ambulatory care in 2001 and the public reporting of its results in 2006 [21]. Since 2009, to discourage the excessive use of antibiotics, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea (HIRA) [22] has provided information on antibiotic usage rates for all hospitals across the nation to the public. The antibiotic usage rate is represented as the total number of antibiotic prescriptions over the total number of visits. We considered this usage rate as a hospital quality index, and based on these HIRA usage rates, we rank-ordered all 779 pediatric clinics in the sampled cities.",

Naver [23] is a leading Internet search portal in Korea with an average market share of 78% and Daum [24] ranks second with an average market share of 15.22% in 2013 [25], and together they maintain the largest online health communities for child-raising parents; therefore, we analyzed the contents of only the local online health communities hosted by Naver and Daum. Furthermore, these 2 sites maintain various online health communities by topic and by region across the nation, such as support groups for cancer patients and general parental care in each local region.",

To ensure that frequently mentioned hospitals were more likely to be recognized as providing high-quality care, we only considered users\u2019 responses to others\u2019 requests for hospital recommendations. A certain user response could denote positive or negative attitudes based on his/her experiences. Sometimes, however, these attitudes were neutral (ie, only hospital names were mentioned without sentimental attitudes) or ambiguous (ie, positive and negative attitudes coexisted). Based on our observation of approximately 18.45% of the sample (32,065/173,748), 92.03% (29,511/32,065) were identified as being positive or neutral in attitude. In this context, we regarded the frequency of hospital names appearing in positive and neutral mentions as a measure of crowdsourced information, representing parents\u2019 beliefs about the quality of local hospitals. In this study, we did not consider negative mentions about hospitals in measuring crowdsourced information because their occurrence rate was less than 7.97% (2554/32,065) and including them did not affect the results of hospital evaluations. To aggregate the user-generated content that might contribute to constructing geospecific crowdsourced information on this particular topic, we selected candidate online communities on the basis of the number of members and the numbers of threads and messages. The contents of online communities can be divided into 3 levels: threads, messages, and sentences. Threads often contain several messages, whereas messages are short, often composed of only a few sentences or sentence fragments.

We selected 6 variables for use in the analysis: birthrate by region, mean and standard deviation of educational attainment for married women, population density, number of pediatric clinics per geographic area, and mean number of doctors per pediatric office. On the basis of previous studies that found pregnant and first-time mothers actively search for online health information, we selected birthrate as the independent variable [16,29]. Gender and education have been found to affect online health searching, specifically women and more educated individuals were found to conduct more online searches [17,30-32]. Therefore, education of married women was selected as a variable. In addition, we chose 3 other variables for availability of pediatric clinics and possible variation of assessment of doctors. Educational attainment refers to the highest level of education that married women had completed and was categorized into no education, elementary school, middle school, high school, 2-year college, 4-year college, master\u2019s degree, and PhD. These were then converted into values of 0, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 23 years of schooling, respectively, to calculate the average and standard deviations for education. For population density, we divided the population of each region by its area. Finally, for the number of doctors per pediatric clinic, we divided the total number of pediatric doctors in the region by the total number of pediatric clinics. We also used another variable, availability, to describe the availability of medical services, which was computed by dividing the total number of pediatric clinics in the region by the total population of that region. Finally, birthrate refers to the average number of children per fertile woman.

Similarly, a 1 SD decrease in doctors per clinic yielded a 0.37 SD increase in the predicted Kendall tau. These results, presented in Table 6, can explain the variations in Kendall tau values across districts we observed in Table 5.",

Large differences in demographic characteristics between S5 and S8 in birthrate (0.897 vs 1.042) and doctors per clinic (1.185 vs 1.808) explained why S5 had a higher Kendall tau value. Similarly, we could explain the difference in congruence of crowdsourced data between the local cities. For instance, a higher Kendall tau value for Daegu in comparison to that for Daejeon was associated with Daegu\u2019s lower birth rate, standard deviation of educational attainment, and number of doctors per clinic.",

            "text": "A higher birthrate in a region implies that there is greater percentage of women with children under age 2 years who have relatively less experience with pediatric clinics. As a result, the proportion of women seeking and sharing information on pediatric hospitals in online communities may be greater for regions with higher birthrates compared with other regions. This can explain why the congruence of crowdsourced data is likely to be lower in a region with higher birthrates. Interestingly, our findings also showed that the average educational attainment of married women in a region was not significantly related to the level of congruence; however, this was not the case for the standard deviation of educational attainment, which had a significant negative relationship with the congruence of crowdsourced data. This difference may be because of the potential mingling of correct and misleading information in the exchange of hospital information in online communities, where users do not have any knowledge of the educational attainment of other users. It is also likely that more densely populated regions are more likely to have a greater number of people gathering pediatric hospital information through offline channels (ie, nearby friends or relatives) than through online communities. In other words, crowdsourced information is created from face-to-face interactions\u2014an offline channel\u2014meaning that there is no definitive build-up of online crowdsourcing in this case. Finally, the greater the number of doctors per clinic, the higher the chances of people may build up less congruent crowdsourced information on these hospitals. This can be explained by the notion that people often judge the same hospital differently according to the doctor they visit; thus, there would be a greater variations in users\u2019 evaluations of a hospital with a large number of doctors as opposed to a smaller number.",

The findings of our study hold practical implications for health policies. From our research, we suggest that government authorities should recognize the power of crowdsourcing and make efforts to reduce the potential risk of low quality health information and the accompanying safety issues. Crowdsourcing for health care services, unlike that for general products and services, is based on contributions from nonspecialists. Furthermore, the quality of crowdsourced information can be lower for pediatric clinics in particular because parents serve as agents for their children who can seldom self-diagnose the various symptoms they are suffering. Therefore, our findings also suggest the need for governmental efforts to counterbalance the misinformation by disseminating approval ratings of pediatric clinics via geospecific online health communities, and that this can be accomplished by prioritizing the regions with the lowest information quality levels.",

Although we collected data on major online communities with many active users by region, we did not fully evaluate all hospitals in each region. However, as we confined our focus to online communities on pediatrics with a relatively large number of users\u2014consisting of typical mothers of young children\u2014we can say that the hospital list by region extracted using text-mining techniques was quite reliable in practice. In addition, although the text mining showed reasonable performance in the Korean language, performance could be enhanced through anaphora resolution of hospital names. It should be noted that the context of an Internet forum is disorganized and the language used tends to follow the idiosyncratic nature of human beings rather than grammatical standards and rules. Therefore, in our future research, we plan to extend the application of the text-mining tool to sentiment analysis and the specific textual relationships between qualitative factors that influence people\u2019s choice of hospitals. In that way, we hope we can draw more practical implications for health policies.",
