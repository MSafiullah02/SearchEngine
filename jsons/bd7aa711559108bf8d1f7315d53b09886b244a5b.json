Previously, we reported a GO-based helicase assay (GOHA), which relied on the preferential binding of ssDNA over dsDNA to the GO surface and subsequent quenching of the fluorescently labeled ssDNA by energy transfer from the dyes to the GO, and we validated the assay using SARS CoV helicase. [10] Herein, we show that the GOHA can be used for measuring the activities of HCV NS3 helicase and SARS CoV helicase in a single mixed solution using two distinct DNA substrates tethered to different fluorophores, and furthermore, for multiplexed high-throughput screening to discover highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of these helicases (Figure 1 ). One round of screening the chemical library using the multiplexed GOHA (mGOHA) revealed three classes of inhibitors-specific inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase, specific inhibitors of SARS CoV helicase, and general inhibitors of both helicases. To date, GO has been used to develop various biosensors and enzyme assays, [10, 11] but concerns about the heterogeneity of the chemical structure and the physical dimensions of GO and nonspecific binding of biomolecules to GO hamper the application of GO-based",

Previously, we reported a GO-based helicase assay (GOHA), which relied on the preferential binding of ssDNA over dsDNA to the GO surface and subsequent quenching of the fluorescently labeled ssDNA by energy transfer from the dyes to the GO, and we validated the assay using SARS CoV helicase. [10] Herein, we show that the GOHA can be used for measuring the activities of HCV NS3 helicase and SARS CoV helicase in a single mixed solution using two distinct DNA substrates tethered to different fluorophores, and furthermore, for multiplexed high-throughput screening to discover highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of these helicases ( Figure 1 ). One round of screening the chemical library using the multiplexed GOHA (mGOHA) revealed three classes of inhibitors-specific inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase, specific inhibitors of SARS CoV helicase, and general inhibitors of both helicases. To date, GO has been used to develop various biosensors and enzyme assays, [10, 11] but concerns about the heterogeneity of the chemical structure and the physical dimensions of GO and nonspecific binding of biomolecules to GO hamper the application of GO-based assays in high-throughput parallel assays for drug discovery that require high robustness and reproducibility. Herein, we show that GO can be used for the discovery of potent smallmolecule drug candidates and also determine the specificity and relative effectiveness towards each helicase of each of the identified hits.",

[13] Fluorescence intensities corresponding to Cy3 (Ex/Em = 550/570 nm) and Cy5 (Ex/Em = 650/670 nm) showed little change without the addition of helicase over 60 min (Figure 2 a) . The addition of SARS CoV helicase led to a dramatic decrease in fluorescence intensity for Cy3 only, while Cy5 fluorescence intensity only showed a very small change, suggesting that the Cy3-labeled DNA duplex was mainly unwound, and subsequently, the interaction of the generated Cy3-labeled ssDNA with GO resulted in the quenching of the Cy3 fluorescence (Figure 2 b ). This data indicated that the unwinding activity of the SARS CoV helicase was specific to its corresponding DNA substrate. Conversely, the addition of HCV NS3 helicase caused a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity of Cy5, but not Cy3 ( To assess the quality of the mGOHA for screening, the Z'factor, a parameter widely used to evaluate the robustness and quality of screening assays, [14] was determined. Generally, high-performance assays have Z'-factors of 0.75 or higher. [15] To calculate the Z'-factor, we ran 30 positive and 30 negative control reactions, calculated the mean (m c+ and m c\u00c0 for the positive and negative controls, respectively) and standard deviations (s c+ and s c\u00c0 ), and used an equation shown in Figure S2b . The Z'-factor of the mGOHA platform for SARS helicase was 0.95 and HCV helicase was 0.94, suggesting that the present GOHA is better and more robust than other established assays (Figure 2 f) .",

            "text": "We next investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory effects for the discovered compounds. First, we determined whether antiSARS-HCV-Hels bind to dsDNA because the low selectivity between the two types of helicases might come from nonspecific binding to dsDNA and thus, slow down the unwinding process. However, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR spectroscopy showed no interaction between the antiSARS-HCV-Hel-1-5 and dsDNA (Figures S7-S9) . We next determined whether the 15 compounds had any inhibition of the ATPase activities of the helicases (Figure 4 b) . SARS-Hel and HCV-Hel possess an ATPase domain for the catalytic hydrolysis of ATP. We used a commercial kit to analyze the ATPase activities of both helicases in the presence of the 15 inhibitors. We found that all of the antiSARS-Hels except for antiSARS-Hel-2 showed a significantly higher inhibition of the ATPase activity of SARS CoV helicase than HCV NS3 helicase; all the antiHCV-Hels showed a much higher inhibition of ATPase activity of HCV NS3 helicase than SARS CoV helicase. AntiSARS-HCV-Hel-1 and -2 blocked the ATPase activities of both helicases to a similar degree. The antiSARS-HCV-Hel-3-5 inhibited the ATPase activity of HCV NS3 helicase more effectively than that of the SARS CoV helicase; however, the overall inhibition of antiSARS-HCV-Hels on the ATPase activities were not as impressive as that of the antiHCV-Hels against the ATPase activity of HCV NS3 helicase. Inhibitors selective for each helicase could block the ATPase activity of each helicase with high selectivity. Further studies should be performed to investigate the mode of inhibition-whether the inhibitors bind to the ATP binding sites or induce conformational change by allosteric regulation. We next measured the inhibition of HCV RNA replication by the 15 selected inhibitors in the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 carrying the HCV replicon RNA with luciferase as a reporter gene (Huh-7 replicon cell). [16] The replicon Huh-7 cells were treated with the 15 inhibitors at concentrations of 0-1000 mm and then lysed, and the luminescence intensity was measured after the addition of luciferin. Separately, the cytotoxicity of each compound was measured in the same cell line using an MTT assay. Relative luciferase signal intensities over relative MTT signal intensities (Luc/ MTT) were plotted versus the concentrations of the inhibitors ( Figure 5 ; see Figure S6 for the complete data of the luciferase and MTT assays). [17] Two compounds, antiHCV-Hel-2 and -3, showed a dose-dependent decrease in the Luc/MTT values with the respective half-maximal effective concentrations (EC 50 ) of 188.1 AE 32.6 and 56.8 AE 7.4 mm, indicating that they dose-dependently blocked HCV RNA replication in the cultured Huh-7 cells (Figure 5 b,c) . AntiHCV-Hel-2 and -3 decreased the luciferase signal by more than 90 % at 1 mm. The other antiHCV-Hel compounds, antiSARS-Hel-5 and all the antiSARS-HCV-Hels, were highly cytotoxic showing less than 40 % cell viability at 1 mm. AntiSARS-Hel-1-4 showed little reduction in the luciferase signal even at 1 mm. We excluded antiHCV-Hel-5 because of its relatively high EC 50 % 400 mm. Taken together, antiHCV-Hel-2 and -3, blocked HCV RNA replication in the cells whereas all of the antiSARS-Hels and antiSARS-HCV-Hels showed no appreciable inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication in cultured cells. These results show that helicase inhibitors should be specific to the corresponding helicase to achieve an inhibitory effect in living cells. In addition, the nonselective inhibitors that moderately reduce the activity of both helicases had a relatively high cytotoxicity, indicating that those compounds should be excluded for further drug development.",

The cells were first treated with 250 mm of antiHCV-Hel-2 and -3 at which the luc/MTT values were 0.39 and 0.24, respectively, and the cell viability based on the MTT assay was over 70 %. After cell lysis, the HCV NS3 serine protease activity was measured with a F\u00e7rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide substrate. Treatment with antiHCV-Hel-2 and -3 reduced the protease activity in the Huh-7 cells down to 30 % of that in the untreated cells. This indicates that NS3 serine protease activity was also decreased as a result of the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in living cells by antiHCV-Hel-2 and -3.",

These results illustrate that mGOHA is an important screening technique for drug discovery targeting helicases. GOHA allows for Figure 5 . Cell-based assay to test the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in Huh-7 liver cells by antiHCV-Hel-2 and -3. a) A luciferase reporter system based on the expression of the HCV subgenome in Huh-7 cells with a neomycin antibiotic resistance marker. b, c) To characterize the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in live cells, Huh-7 liver cells were treated with inhibitors and luciferase signal intensity from the reporter shown in (a) divided by cell viability was plotted versus inhibitor concentrations (to correct for luciferase signal loss from cytotoxicity of the compounds). d) To confirm that the two inhibitors block HCV RNA replication and thus, reduce the expression of HCV enzymes, the HCV NS3 serine protease activity of the Huh-7 cell lysates was measured following incubation with the two inhibitors. more-accurate, real-time, quantitative monitoring of helicase activity by simply following the changes in fluorescence intensity, without requiring any additional separation steps or trapping agents. A multiplexed screen is highly advantageous not only because multiple rounds of screening are combined into one screen to reduce the overall cost and labor, but also because just one round of multiplexed screening provides information on the relative selectivity of the hit compounds towards each target helicase. Given that various GO-based activity assays have been developed for various enzymes, including nucleases, [18a] methyltransferases, [18] and caspases, [11c] the present work shows that a GO-based assay can be used for high-throughput screening for new inhibitors of various essential enzymes.",

The addition of multiple drugs acting against independent viral targets should be more effective in controlling infection with a rapidly mutating virus. We expect that the new inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase discovered herin could be useful as antiviral drugs for the next generation of HCV treatment, with three or more active components. In addition, we expect that GOHA can be used to evaluate helicase activities in a highly parallel manner and of helicase-inhibitor-based drugs for various diseases, which has been difficult without a robust helicase assay.
