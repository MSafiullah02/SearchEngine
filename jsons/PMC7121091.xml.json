The kit contains a set of reagents due to which it is possible to perform a Multiplex PCR. Simplification of the two-step method results in an increased repeatability of analysis and efficiency of reaction. The kit for determining 15 respiratory viruses in a sample of a clinical material is based on a process of reverse transcription (RT) and amplification of the target DNA by PCR using Dual Priming Oligonucleotide (DPO) primers, which provides freedom in a primer design and PCR optimisation and maximizes PCR specificity and sensitivity by fundamentally blocking non-specific priming. The DPO-based multiplex assay that permits the simultaneous amplification of target sequences of 15 viruses, presented after the amplification reaction, uses e.g., electrophoresis in an agarose gel preceded by nucleic acid isolation (Kim et al. 2013).",

Panel C has as an internal control a human RNase P, which allows the inspection of the whole process from the extraction of nucleic acids to RT-PCR. Additionally, 8-methoxypsoralen was used, which suppresses the activity of a DNA template. The 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) reagent binds to the double-stranded structure of nucleic acids, forming covalent bonds between the strands upon activation by ultraviolet light.\n",

The preparation of the gel consisted of dissolving the agarose in TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) buffer. After partial cooling, ethidium bromide was added at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The gel was solidified using special well combs and mixtures, after amplification, were applied to the resulting holes in the agarose. The mixture also contained a loading dye. This procedure makes it possible to control the electrophoretic separation process using the kit for electrophoresis Wide Mini-SubCell GT/PowerPac Basic System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Thus, the electrophoresis was carried out by controlling the migration of PCR products in a gel by placing a loading dye \u2013 bromphenol blue. To get the maximum separation of DNA fragments, the electric field did not exceed 5 V/cm of the gel. After the electrophoresis, the gel was analyzed under UV light in the GelDoc EQ system, and the resulting image was documented using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).",

The difficulty in the treatment of infections caused by respiratory viruses is related to the lack of effective drugs. The only exception to this end is the treatment of influenza with the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir which are highly effective (Demkow 2008; Van-Tam and Sellwood 2013).",
