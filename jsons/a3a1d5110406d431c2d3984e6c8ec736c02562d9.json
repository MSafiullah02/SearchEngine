After sufficient exposure to COVID-19 infected agents, symptoms present as fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, shortness of breath, sputum production and myalgias [4] . Diagnosis requires detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection is better in nasopharynx samples compared to throat samples [2] . COVID-19 presentations are very similar to acute sarcoidosis which is rare but is very troublesome disease for pilots and may be confusing lead to delay in treatment. Sarcoidosis more common in Caucasian population and typically has a spontaneous remission within 2yr [5] .Based on medical aviation regulations, due to high probability of brain, heart and lungs involvement and treatment complications, pilots with sarcoidosis need full systematic assessment and follow up with not allowance to fly until the follow up completion and therapy cessation. However, they have very low chance for return to flying, even with restrictions [6, 7] .",
