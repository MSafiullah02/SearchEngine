Identification of cases and isolation, either in quarantine facilities or at home, is a key strategic measure in the containment phase. As the infection becomes more widespread with established community transmission, measures to reduce exposure to crowded places may be recommended in an attempt to delay further spread and reduce peaks in healthcare activity. Intensive social distance measures in Wuhan, China appear to have helped to control the outbreak, at least in the short-term\n3. Although there is evidence to support the use of hygienic measures such as hand hygiene, empirical evidence to support the use of social distancing is very limited\n4. In the context of pandemic influenza, modelling studies suggest a role for social distancing in combination with other strategies\n5 but, at least in the context of the 2009 influenza pandemic, where transmission was high but case fatality was low, social distancing measures were likely not to have been cost effective\n6. Qualitative research shows that hand and respiratory hygiene were viewed as familiar and socially responsible actions to take but that there is ambivalence about adopting isolation and personal distancing behaviours due to their perceived adverse impact and potential to attract social stigma\n7. In the context of COVID-19, which appears to transmit readily and to have an appreciably higher case fatality than H1N1pdm2009\n8, social distancing measures maybe warranted to slow the spread of the infection.",

            "text": "Respiratory infections transmit through contact and airborne routes. In contact transmission self- inoculation of mucous membranes by contaminated hands may involve direct transfer of virus from one infected person to another or indirect transfer of virus through contaminated intermediate objects (fomites). Airborne transmission can involve droplets (>5 \u03bcm) which can lead to short range transmission through direct deposition of droplets on mucous membranes and the upper respiratory tract through coughing, sneezing and breathing of the infected individual and aerosol transmission with droplet nuclei which can remain suspended in the air for long periods and be inhaled and deposited along the respiratory tract, including the lower airways\n9. Assessing the relative importance of these modalities in respiratory infection transmission is complex. The relative importance may also vary by setting and pathogen. In the context of crowded public spaces rather than direct contact with infected individuals indirect contact and aerosol transmission may become relatively more important than in the context of face to face contact with infected individuals. Understanding the extent to which exposure to potentially crowded public places increases the risk of acquiring common respiratory infections, could help to inform control of emerging respiratory infections, which likely transmit using similar modalities.We aimed to assess this through analysis of the Flu Watch study\n10, a large community cohort study that was designed to investigate incidence and risk factors for influenza.",

            "text": "Flu Watch was a community cohort study of respiratory infection occurrence and risk factors which followed up households across England and Wales through the winter seasons of 2006/7\u20132010/10\n10,\n11. Participants were randomly selected from patient lists of general practitioners and sent letters to recruit the whole household. Those with terminal illness or who were participating in other research studies were excluded. Households were recruited in the autumn and followed up through winter periods until spring. During follow up, participants were contacted weekly and asked to report whether they had a cough, cold, sore throat or fever. They were also asked to complete illness diaries recording symptoms for any acute respiratory illness. In this study we are utilising self-reported respiratory infection regardless of whether or not the infection was laboratory confirmed. During the first three years of Flu Watch (2006/7, 2007/8, 2008/9) illness diaries included a series of questions on how many days in the week before illness onset a series of activities had occurred. These activities were: use of bus, underground train, train, plane, public house/bar/nightclub, eating out at a restaurant/caf\u00e9/canteen, going to a place of worship, going to a party for adults, going to the supermarket or small shops, going to the cinema/theatre/sports event, and playing sport., The same questions were asked at baseline. We also asked whether participants had spent more than five minutes in a room with anybody with a cold other than a member of their own household.",

We used a case-crossover design\n12, in which cases act as their own controls during a non-exposure time-period (i.e. baseline in the present study), to investigate whether exposure to the public in venues such as public transport, supermarkets, cinemas etc. and contact with those with the common cold were associated with acute respiratory infection syndromes. Case-crossover designs are appropriate to investigate the effect of transient exposures (e.g. exposure to infections in public places) on an acute outcome (e.g. acute respiratory infection syndrome) within a plausible hazard period (e.g. one week, to account for the 1\u20137 day incubation period of commonly circulating respiratory pathogens\n13). As this is a paired test, comparing individuals in the week before baseline (referent period) with themselves in the week before illness onset (hazard period), non-time varying variables cannot act as confounders.",

Stata\nmi logit commands were used to impute missing data for binary exposure variables (activity conducted during week vs activity not conducted) using season, age group, gender, and illness vs baseline as predictors. We did not attempt to impute the frequency of exposure (0/7 days). In the UK context, social activities such as going to parties, meals out, or going out to public houses, bars or nightclubs increase in the period before Christmas and New Year, so, for these activities we excluded illnesses occurring in weeks 50 to week 1 (equating to exposures in week 49\u201352).

            "text": "Our study was based on large numbers of acute respiratory infection syndromes identified through active surveillance of adults. By measuring exposures in the week before illness we focussed on the likely incubation period of common respiratory infections. Exposures were recorded close to the time of occurrence, minimizing recall bias. By comparing exposures prior to periods of illness and at baseline in the same individuals we eliminated the impact of non-time-varying confounders. Our findings are robust to adjustment for time of year (season) and, for exposures that are strongly associated with the Christmas period, to removal of illnesses occurring in the run up to Christmas and New Year. We cannot exclude that our findings may be influenced by time-dependent variations in activities and levels of respiratory illness that are not accounted for by these measures, but note that our findings are consistent across a wide range of plausible public activities. The finding in relation to contact with somebody with a cold may be influenced by differential recall bias whereby those with a respiratory infection are more likely to remember such contact than those who are not ill. These findings relate to undifferentiated acute respiratory infections that are widespread during the winter. Common seasonal respiratory viruses and COVID-19 appear to be transmitted in similar ways i.e. via a combination of droplet, and direct and indirect contact with infected secretions and an uncertain amount of aerosol-based transmission\n27\u2013\n29. Exposure to public places could increase each of these forms of exposure, for example through holding onto/touching surfaces, close contact with symptomatic people and inhalation of aerosols with viral particles.",

Minimising public activities such as use of public transport, shopping, eating out, attending entertainment venues, going to parties and places of worship may be helpful in slowing the spread of infection and reducing peak intensity of transmission and associated healthcare usage. Minimising exposure to public venues may be of particular relevance for the elderly and those with chronic illness who are more likely than healthy young adults to develop complications of infection and to die. The impact of reducing contact with crowds on quality of life, personal autonomy, livelihoods and the wider economy need to be balanced with the potential reduction in attack rates and the potential to reduce surges in healthcare activity and mortality.",
