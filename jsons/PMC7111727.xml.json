            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the causative agents of major diseases in a variety of avian and mammalian species including humans. CoVs belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae of the Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. The Orthocoronavirinae subfamily is further divided into four genera including, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and the recently identified Deltacoronavirus (Chan et al., 2013, King et al., 2018). To date, six CoVs have been reported in pigs: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Pan et al., 2017, Homwong et al., 2016). PDCoV was first recorded as an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 (Chan et al., 2013, Woo et al., 2012), and thereafter was isolated from a swine farm in Ohio, USA in 2014 (Wang et al., 2014a). Since then, PDCoV has been reported in many countries and regions, including USA, Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Mexico, Japan, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Lao PDR (Lee and Lee, 2014, Suzuki et al., 2018, Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014b, Ajayi et al., 2018, Perez-Rivera et al., 2019). A previous study showed that the global PDCoVs consist of the China lineage, the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage, and the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage (Zhang et al., 2019). PDCoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 25.4 kb. The genome includes a 5\u2032UTR, ORF1a/1b, the spike (S), the envelope (E), the membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), the nucleocapsid (N), the nonstructural protein 7 (NS7), and a 3\u2032UTR (Lee and Lee, 2014).",

            "text": "The codon usage pattern is an important indicator of genome evolution. Except for methionine and tryptophan, more than one codon can encode an amino acid due to the redundancy of the genetic code. Codons encoding the same amino acid also are known as synonymous codons. Interestingly, the codon usage is not random and some codons are used more than others, a phenomenon referred to as codon usage bias (Marin et al., 1989). Codon usage bias has been reported for some RNA viruses. However, the degree of bias varies depending on the identity of the specific virus. For instance, Rubella virus and Rotavirus show strong codon usage biases, whereas Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), Ebola virus (EBOV), the N gene of Rabies virus (RABV), and Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) show weak codon usage bias (Belalov and Lukashev, 2013, Yin et al., 2013, Cristina et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2014, He et al., 2017). Natural selection, mutation pressure, the abundance of tRNA, RNA structure, and gene length all contribute to the codon usage bias (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003, Parmley and Hurst, 2007, Hershberg and Petrov, 2008, Plotkin and Kudla, 2011). The virus and host can both influence codon usage, which likely affects the survival, evolution, fitness, and immune evasion of the virus from host defenses (Li et al., 2018b, Li et al., 2019, He et al., 2019). Indeed, synonymous triplets are not used randomly, and factors such as natural selection and saltatorial bias can cause synonymous codon usage to diverge (Sharp and Li, 1986). Investigating the codon usage patterns of viruses could provide insights into their molecular evolution and viral gene expression regulation, assisting vaccine design, in which high levels of viral antigen expression are likely to be needed to produce immunity (Butt et al., 2014). Given the recent increase in PDCoV epidemics and the threat to pork production, in the present study, we reported an exhaustive genome-wide investigation of PDCoV codon usage and evaluated the possible influencing factors.",

The ENC values vary between 20 and 61, with values closer to 20 indicating a high codon usage bias and values closer to 61 indicating a low codon usage bias. The ENC value can reflect the preference of a synonymous codon in a family of codons. Highly expressed genes often show a high codon usage bias, whereas poorly expressed genes contain more rare codons and thus a lower codon usage bias. Generally, the codon usage is considered to show strong bias when the ENC value is less than or equal to 45 (Comeron and Aguade, 1998). We used the following equation to calculate the ENC (Fuglsang, 2006):ENC=2+9F\u00af2+1F\u00af3+5F\u00af4+3F\u00af6where the average value of Fi (i = 2, 3, 4, 6) for the i-fold degenerate amino acids is represented by F.

When the codon usage is limited only to the GC3 mutation, the expected ENC value falls on a theoretical curve (the functional relationship between the ENC expectation curve and the GC3 value). When the actual ENC-plot values of these sequences are lower than the standard curve, it is suggestive of natural selection playing a role in driving codon usage bias (Fuglsang, 2008). The theoretical ENC values in ENC-plot analysis were calculated as follows.ENCexpected=2+s+29s2+(1-s)2where s denotes the frequency of C or G at the synonymous codons third position (i.e. GC3).",

In the graph, the plot regression coefficient is considered as the mutation selection balance coefficient, and the evolutionary rates caused by natural selection pressure and mutation pressure are represented by the slope of the regression line. If all points are distributed along the diagonal and there is no significant difference in the three codon positions, this indicates that there is only weak or no external selection pressure. However, if the regression curve is parallel or tilted to the horizontal axis, this would indicate that the correlation between the changes of GC12 and GC3 is very low. Thus, the regression curve shows that the effect of natural selection evolution effectively balances the degree of neutrality (Kumar et al., 2016).",

The correlation coefficient in the USA-Japan-Korea group, China group, and Thailand-Early China-Vietnam group were the 0.2017 \u00b1 0.3707, 0.143 \u00b1 0.3942, and 0.1142 \u00b1 0.4873, respectively.

            "text": "Based on the S coding gene and complete coding genomes, we found a significant preference for A and U nucleotides, rather than G and C. The contents of AU and GC were not equal and were more inclined towards the usage of AU nucleotides. If the use of a synonymous codon was affected only by mutation pressure, the frequency of U and A nucleotides in the third codon position should be equal to the frequency of G and C (van Hemert et al., 2016). Thus, we can conclude that there was a low bias in the usage of nucleotides in all PDCoV strains. RSCU analysis revealed that PDCoV genomes have a tendency towards U-ending codons. In addition, the relative probability distribution of 16 dinucleotides showed that codons and dinucleotides were used unequal and followed certain rules. Dinucleotide abundance influences the codon usage bias in certain organisms, including RNA and DNA viruses (Rothberg and Wimmer, 1981). Dinucleotide sequences may be derived from odd partial of amino acid changes or codon usage bias; therefore, we analyzed dinucleotide composition distribution (Plotkin et al., 2004, Cristina et al., 2015). The translational selection pressure on a dinucleotide is the entropy cost of a given set of constraints that alter the number of dinucleotide occurrences, in this case the amino acid sequence of the given protein sequence and the cost of the codon usage bias (Cristina et al., 2015). Analyses of the frequencies of codons and dinucleotides revealed that translation selection also played a part in the codon usage of PDCoVs. These initial observations prompted further investigation to assess the extent of codon usage bias using ENC analyses. For PDCoV, the ENC value based on the S gene or complete coding genomes was 52, indicative of slight bias and that different PDCoVs are relatively conserved and stable. Previous studies indicated that ENC values correlate negatively with gene expression (van Hemert and Berkhout, 2016). Thus, a higher ENC value indicates lower gene expression and lower codon preference. A low codon bias could be explained by the need to better adapt towards efficient replication and survival in the host, and to reduce the energy required for virus biosynthesis while avoiding competition with host protein synthesis (van Hemert et al., 2016). When the ENC and GC3 values of PDCoVs were plotted, mutation pressure was revealed as a moderate factor influencing the PDCoV codon usage pattern. According to previous reports, both natural selection and mutation pressure can affect the ENC value, which indicates that the relative contribution of selection and mutation on the codon usage pattern are not robust (Chen et al., 2014, Gu et al., 2004). It is worth mentioning that the codon usage bias of species with A/U biased genomes is different from that of genomes with a G/C bias. Therefore, simple ENC-GC3 map analysis might be misleading. Generally, mutation pressure will always have a role in driving the codon usage of viruses. Here, using neutrality plots we found that natural selection was a more dominant factor compared with mutation pressure (Shi et al., 2013). Natural selection can lead to weak codon usage bias while the virus is trying to adapt to the host cells (Matsumoto et al., 2016). PR2 bias plot analysis showed that both natural selection and mutation pressure contributed to the observed codon bias consistent with the neutrality analysis.",
