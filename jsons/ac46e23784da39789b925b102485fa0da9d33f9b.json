Those facilities seemed to be appropriate during early stage of pandemic. However, learning from the worldwide outbreak and its clinical presentation 3 , huge influx of suspicious cases is expected, which might overwhelm the initial indoor setting, so we installed 10 well-ventilated single room tents at outdoor parking lots immediately outside the ED entrance. Moreover, outdoor concrete chemical decontamination area is turned into a radiograph room, personal protective equipment (PPE) removal corridor, and shower service. High-risk patients with oxygen demand or critical conditions were transported to indoor infection isolation areas for any resuscitation support. Stable patients were led to individual tents. In response to the worldwide spread and the presence of sporadic native cases in Taiwan 4 , tent numbers were flexibly increased to 15, and enough time was allowed to build a modular house with 14 isolate rooms. A parking lot before the ED entrance is another key element to offer a buffer area for urgent tents and to engage perfectly with our prefixed patient flow (Figure1A).",

Totally, 1496 cases in tents and 270 cases in indoor isolation areas were recorded from January 22 to April 19, 2020. Three COVID-19 cases were detected, free of nosocomial infection. However, massive community spread may threaten people with multiple comorbidities that require large space with sophisticated medical devises. Thus, we proposed dividing ED ventilation system into sub-compartmentalization to handle critical infected/non-infected patients ( Figure 1B) . By integrating the original facility and tent area, along with smooth screening of patients and avoiding rapid consumption of essential but shortage logistic inventory add proactive and dynamic strategies to enhance surge capacity, thereby preventing nosocomial transmission.",
