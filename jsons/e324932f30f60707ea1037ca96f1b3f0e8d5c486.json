In the 1980s, intense animal and human research on HFOV confi rmed it as a viable technique for ventilation. The work of deLemos and colleagues using the infant baboon model set the stage for human trials and found that HFOV, when compared to the conventional ventilation used at that time, resulted in less lung injury (deLemos et al. 1987 Meredith et al. 1989 ; Kinsella et al. 1991 ) . By the early 1990's, there was a wealth of information from multiple investigators, using multiple animal models, suggesting that HFOV caused less injury to the immature lung than did \"conventional ventilation\" (Hamilton et al. 1983 ; Truog et al. 1984 ; McCulloch et al. 1988 ; Jackson et al. 1994 ) . The generally accepted mechanism of this superiority was the ability to support gas exchange with small tidal volumes and high mean airway pressure, thereby minimizing injury from both overdistention and atelectasis.",

While the mean airway pressure holds the lung open and promotes oxygenation, the oscillations essentially \"shake\" the gas, promoting rapid and effi cient gas exchange. As HFOV amplitude is increased, there is increased shaking, which results in increased mixing and increased gas exchange.",

However, at 10 Hz (600 breaths/min), there is signifi cant attenuation of the amplitude signal by the airways. At 20 Hz, the attenuation is even more pronounced, causing even less of the amplitude pressure to be transmitted to the airway. Thus, changes in HFOV frequency have profound effects on the amount of pressure transmitted to the alveoli and on the effi cacy of gas mixing.",

A trial in pediatric patients (Arnold et al. 1994 ) showed a signifi cant improvement in oxygenation during HFOV compared with a conventional ventilatory strategy and a decreased need for supplemental oxygen at 30 days. Aggressive recruitment of lung volume during HFOV is often achieved using higher mean airway pressures compared to conventional ventilation. A multicenter experience from different pediatric intensive care units in the United States demonstrated signifi cant increases in mean airway pressure and concomitant increases in oxygenation index when patients were transitioned from conventional ventilation to HFOV (Arnold et al. 2000 ) . HFOV has been advocated as a rescue strategy in patients who are failing conventional ventilation, but smaller single-center studies in children (Fedora et al. 2000 ; Ben Jaballah et al. 2005 ) and adults (Mehta et al. 2001 ) also suggested some benefi t towards an early implementation of HFOV.

The application of an aggressive recruitment strategy may increase the incidence of air trapping and the risk of extrapulmonary leak. However, infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections may present with both acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to acute lung injury and impaired CO 2 elimination secondary to small airway obstruction. The successful use of HFOV in infants with RSV infection has been reported in a few cases, leading to reversal of hypoxemia and recruitment of atelectasis while achieving adequate CO 2 removal (Berner et al. 2008 ) . The use of HFOV in intubated children with status asthmaticus to facilitate CO 2 removal has also been reported (Duval and van Vught 2000 ) . However, utilizing HFOV to achieve adequate CO 2 removal in this setting often requires the combination of a high amplitude and a low device frequency, resulting in increased delivered tidal volumes during HFOV. Since delivered tidal volumes are not measured during HFOV and may be as high as 5 ml/kg during clinical use (Sturtz et al. 2008 ), a high-amplitude low-frequency strategy may result in increased lung overdistention and may compromise the lung protective effects of HFOV .",

Like conventional ventilation, HFJV depends on passive exhalation and adequate expiratory time is necessary to avoid air trapping. The optimal rate is a function of time constants. Faster rate is appropriate and safe with uniform atelectatic disease, especially in small infants. Larger infants have longer time constants and need slower rates. Infants with obstructive lung disease (MAS, BPD) also have longer time constants. Typical rate is 420-500 for very small infants with RDS and as low as 280-320 with large infants with MAS.

Consequently, PEEP values necessary for adequate mean airway pressures are higher than those used with conventional ventilation. Put another way, when changing from conventional ventilation with a typical I:E ratio of 1:2, if PIP and PEEP are kept unchanged, the mean airway pressure will drop substantially. This may be somewhat desirable when treating air leak, but when treating atelectasis-prone lungs, this will result in progressive atelectasis.

There are limited data to support recommendations for its use (Keszler et al. 1982 ) . It is primarily used during initial lung volume recruitment or after suctioning or patient disconnection from the ventilator circuit, but very low rate of IMV sighs may be continued throughout to maintain recruitment of the less compliant portions of the lung. Even when optimally recruited and made as homogeneous as possible, the lungs will have some degree of inhomogeneity due to gravitational factors. With constant distending pressure alone, an MAP high enough to maintain the less compliant portions infl ated will inevitably overexpand the more compliant portions. A slightly lower MAP may be used with HFJV and very low rate of sighs (2/minute) may be helpful in periodically re-recruiting the less compliant areas. However, while used by the author for 25 years, this practice has not been systematically evaluated in clinical research. The manufacturer recommends the following approach: The IMV rate should be initially set at 5-10 breaths/min to facilitate recruitment. Once good oxygenation is achieved, the background rate can be discontinued. If oxygenation deteriorates, PEEP is insuffi cient to maintain lung volume and needs to be increased.

The lungs are relatively uniformly involved and can be effectively recruited (made more homogeneously infl ated) with appropriate lung recruitment strategies. Optimization of lung volume is key to achieving a homogeneously aerated lung, ensuring even distribution of lung volume, preserving surfactant function, and minimizing lung injury (McCulloch et al. 1988 ). The advantage of HFV in general is that the use of small tidal volumes at high frequencies allows for the use of higher mean airway pressure without high peak pressure and thus allows for more effective and presumably safer alveolar recruitment. In contrast to HFOV where mean airway pressure is directly controlled, mean airway pressure with HFJV is controlled primarily by increasing PEEP on the tandem conventional ventilator. As previously mentioned, because the inspiratory time is extremely short, mean airway pressure is only modestly higher than PEEP. Therefore, PEEP values much higher than those with which many clinicians are comfortable are required to achieve adequate lung volume recruitment. This PEEP-o-phobia has been one of the barriers to successful implementation of HFJV in the treatment of severe, uniform atelectatic disease. With HFOV where PEEP is not a set or monitored value and therefore not a concern, there is now uniform acceptance of the use of high mean airway pressure (Clark et al. 2000 ) .",

Early users of HFJV emphasized minimal PIP and MAP, in order to facilitate resolution of the air leak, typically using PEEP of 3-5 cm H 2 O. However, it soon became apparent that while the PIE resolved, the lungs became diffusely atelectatic with worsening V/Q mismatch and lung compliance, soon leading to the need for higher PIP. The unique properties of the jet ventilator make it possible to use relatively high PEEP (5-8 cm H 2 O) that maintains adequate lung infl ation and still allow for resolution of air leak, because the extremely short inspiratory time minimizes air passage through the point of the tissue disruption. The presence of PIE should limit the use of aggressive volume recruitment maneuvers and encourage acceptance of higher FiO 2 requirement and PaCO 2 values. Background IMV sighs are usually discontinued when treating air leak, but exceptions to this rule may be warranted when extensive atelectasis co-exists.",

            "text": "Airway obstruction usually predominates in the early stages. Although HFJV may facilitate mobilization of secretions, the presence of particulate debris in the large airways may interfere with effi cient ventilation. Thorough suctioning of the upper airway prior to initiation of HFJV is recommended. In infants in whom the surfactant inhibitory effect of meconium (Moses et al. 1991 ) predominates and in the subsequent infl ammatory stages of MAS, HFJV is usually quite effective, because these infants have relatively uniform lung disease. It is critical to appreciate the need for lower respiratory rates (typically 280-320 bpm) in these infants who have prolonged time constants. One of the apparent, though not clearly documented, benefi ts unique to HFJV is the greatly increased clearance of residual meconium from the upper airways owing to the constant rotational coaxial outfl ow of gas along the periphery of the airway. Mean airway pressure needs to be relatively high, even in the presence of air trapping. This is because airway diameter is increased at higher MAP, minimizing the ball-valve effect of particulate meconium. Both HFOV and HFJV are widely used in infants with PPHN and severe nonuniform lung disease who are potential candidates for ECMO. Virtually all of regional referral centers that offer ECMO have one or more types of HFV available, and anecdotally, few infants progress to ECMO without a trial of HFJV, HFOV, or both. In infants with PPHN and severe lung disease, HFJV used with the optimal lung volume strategy may be helpful in optimizing lung infl ation and response to iNO. The combination of HFJV and iNO is occasionally required for interhospital transport of critically ill infants referred for ECMO and has been successfully practiced at Georgetown University and a handful of other ECMO centers for a decade or more. Effective use of these therapies has reduced the need for ECMO for infants with MAS and PPHN to a fraction of the rate seen in the early 1990s (Conrad et al. 2005 ) .",

Permissive hypercapnia and higher than usual FiO 2 targets are typically accepted in order to mitigate hemodynamic impairment. The clinical benefi t is usually quite obvious, and ventilation often improves dramatically, at times leading to inadvertent hyperventilation.

The anecdotal evidence for improved gas exchange at lower PIP with HFJV in such infants is strong and, coupled with a nonaggressive approach to ventilation, appears to have reduced the need for ECMO in this very high-risk group. Because overexpansion of hypoplastic lungs will worsen pulmonary hypertension, the general approach is to use the lowest possible PIP and MAP consistent with acceptable gas exchange, with the avoidance of lung injury and measures to control PPHN as the primary goals of therapy. It has been the author's practice to continue HFJV until pulmonary hypertension has improved and the patient is ready for surgical repair. Intraoperative and postoperative use of HFJV is physiologically attractive and supported by anecdotal experience, but its use may be dependent on the preference of the surgeon.",

These infants require slower ventilatory rate because of their larger size and higher airway resistance but appear to respond well to HFJV when conventional ventilation is failing or requires high pressure. Because sepsis is often involved, there is often an element of restrictive disease due to abdominal distention and edema, as well as signifi cant hemodynamic impairment. The primary pulmonary derangement may be quite variable but generally includes nonhomogeneous distribution of ventilation and variable time constants with a tendency for air trapping. The airway resistance is almost always increased, but air trapping is often made worse at lower MAP, because of airway collapse. Thus, although it may appear counterintuitive, increasing PEEP will often result in resolution of air trapping. Because these infants may be critically ill with sepsis, their outcome requires a comprehensive approach with effective respiratory support being only one of the determinants of ultimate outcome.

It is important to keep in mind the risk of hyperinfl ation in case of ETT plug and to verify the ETT lumen frequently by suctioning. \u2022 Using CTGI in routine: CTGI during days is possible but security device is mandatory. \u2022 Tracheal suctioning: With a catheter for CTGI inserted in the ETT, we have to move the catheter, suction, and place again the catheter. With the specifi c Vygon ETT, it is possible to suction whenever it is necessary. During suctioning, the CTGI fl ow supplies oxygen and facilitates breathing. Subsequently, there is less bradycardia or hypoxemia. With security device, the activation of alarm indicates the need for suctioning and sometimes is activated by suction itself. \u2022 Using a pump as CTGI fl ow provider ( Fig. 22.4b ): Two problems are diffi cult to deal with. One is the noise as the best location for the pump is inside the incubator; the other is the diffi culty to sterilize the device between two patients. Fig. 22.3 Safety system for CTGI.

When we have monitored the tracheal pressure during CTGI, we have noticed that the pressure curve is lift of 0.85 mmHg for 0.5 L/min of CTGI fl ow rate.",

Conclusion: CTGI needs to be evaluated in large multicentric studies, but at this moment, there is no ventilatory mode or option available on our ventilators able to be as effective as CTGI. If the use of CTGI is indicated, it must be managed preferentially with a security device, presented in Fig. 22 .3b , able to switch off automatically the CTGI fl ow and to open an electrovalve to acceler-ate the diminution of the pressure in the CTGI circuit.
