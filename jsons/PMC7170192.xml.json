            "text": "It is understandable that a sense of complacency about infectious disease took hold of medicine and public health in the late twentieth century. Improvements in sanitation, nutrition, housing, and occupational health dramatically decreased infectious disease rates in the United States. Immunizations were effective against viral infections: smallpox was eradicated world-wide; rubella was eliminated from North America; and rates of other childhood viral diseases markedly reduced.1,\n2 With the development of safe and effective vaccines and drugs to treat bacterial infections, bacteria appeared defeated. All these factors caused an inappropriate confidence that infectious diseases would be completely eradicated as a public health problem. In fact, in 1967, US Surgeon General William H. Stewart announced that it was \u2018time to close the book on infectious diseases, declare the war against pestilence won, and shift national resources to such chronic problems as cancer and heart disease.'3 Despite this hubris, others began to sound the alarm. The term \u2018emerging diseases\u2019 was first used by David J. Sencer in 1971.4 In 1976, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) investigated an outbreak of disease affecting attendees at the National American Legion Convention in Philadelphia, and the following year CDC isolated the causative agent, Legionella pneumophila, for what is now called Legionnaire's disease. In 1981, Richard M. Krause, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, published an early clarion call with his book The Restless Tide: The Persistent Challenge of the Microbial World.5 Shortly thereafter, the epidemic of AIDS was recognized and over the next 10 years a growing sense of unease arose as new infectious disease outbreaks were identified.",

The slave trade was responsible for the movement of HTLV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus)-I, HTLV-II, yellow fever virus and, importantly, its mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, to the Americas. In the 1970s, Aedes albopictus, a mosquito vector competent for transmission of dengue was inadvertently imported into North America from Asia as a result of the international trade in used tires.

Disease occurs when a pathogen meets a host that is vulnerable to the agent in an environment that allows the agent and host to interact. Agent, host, and environment alone are not sufficient to cause an epidemic, however. For a pathogen to be successful in causing an epidemic, an unbroken chain of transmission must be present. Given a suitable mode of spread and a chain of transmission from one susceptible host to another, an outbreak can develop. The chain of transmission may be thought of categorically as a source for the agent, the presence of the agent (pathogen), a portal of exit from the source, a mode of transmission, a portal of entry into the host, and a susceptible host.",

Certain characteristics of the pathogen are important to consider. Infectivity is the capacity to cause infection in a susceptible host. Not all infections result in symptomatic disease, however. The pathogenicity of the agent is the capacity to cause disease in a host. And finally, the virulence of the pathogen determines the severity of disease that the agent causes in the host. Pursuing influenza as an example, although humans who interact with poultry are likely frequently exposed, many avian influenza viruses are either not spread to humans (low infectivity) or, of those which are, they may infect a human but are unable to cause disease (low pathogenicity). However, with reassortment of the influenza genome, there is potential for influenza viruses to cause severe illness and death in humans (i.e. H5N1).",

Droplet spread in which there is direct projection of infectious droplets onto the mucus membranes of the host also is included in this category. Droplet transmission, such as with influenza, occurs via large particles (measuring 5 microns) expelled when a person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These particles are generally propelled no more than 3 feet from the infected person in any direction. Indirect transmission may be vehicle-borne, in other words, spread via fomites, blood products (blood-borne transmission), or fecal contamination of water and food (fecal\u2013oral transmission). Vector-borne diseases are transmitted indirectly by a live carrier, usually an arthropod, such as mosquitoes, fleas, or ticks. The transmission may be mechanical, in which the vector acts to transport the pathogen, but is not biologically necessary for replication, such as fecal coliform bacteria transported by a housefly, or biological transmission in which the vector is a site of replication of the pathogen, such as malarial parasites in mosquito species.",

Even diseases with similar R0 values can have different patterns of epidemic spread, with one turning into a pandemic and the other extinguishing locally. This highlights problems with the SIR model. Notably, it assumes a well-mixed, homogeneous population. Populations are frequently heterogeneous, however, with people interacting through networks of relationships. Disease transmission is facilitated between members of such networks more efficiently than outside these networks. Studies of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) highlight the important role of networks in disease transmission, but networks are equally important in diseases transmitted by other routes besides sexual transmission. Tuberculosis, for example, is much easier spread to family members because it requires prolonged, close contact. Additionally, the model does not take into account stochastic events which may have profound effects on the course of an epidemic. One infectious patient traveling on an intercontinental flight to an immunologically na\u00efve population may have a profound impact on spread of a respiratory disease. Finally, the model fails to recognize the importance of host factors that lend to epidemic potential. For example, in some diseases, there are outliers of transmission potential in which an infected individual, a superspreader, may be more efficient at transmitting the disease than the observed average R0 of the disease.",

Initially, antigenic drift allows an avian strain to infect a human host, but does not typically confer sufficient specificity to humans to allow for human-to-human transmission. It is postulated that this initial step has been facilitated in the past by the ongoing practice of human\u2013avian cohabitation in the rural regions of Southeast Asia. Domesticated ducks, in particular, are known to excrete high titers of influenza from their GI tracts, with influenza deposited into local ponds remaining active for weeks.18 Next, individuals infected by both avian and human strains provide the opportunity for an antigenic shift to occur, whereby the virulent avian strain can gain characteristics that allow it to propagate human to human. Of note, both the 1957 H2N2 and the 1968 H3N2 pandemic strains were thought to develop along similar two-step pathways, while the 1918 H1N1 strain has more recently been shown to be a product of antigenic drift alone.19 Of more concern to contemporary policy makers, the highly lethal H5N1 avian virus has been shown to need only minimal modification by either route to gain a foothold among humans.20\n",

Despite global eradication efforts, the re-emergence and spread of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), continues to threaten global eradication goals, and has again made the disease a public health threat. MDRTB is defined as a strain of tuberculosis that has developed resistance to both isoniazid and, most importantly, rifampin, the most powerful bactericidal antituberculosis medications presently available. MDRTB strains originate from sites of poor tuberculosis-control infrastructure, where inadequate drug supplies, inconsistent treatment regimens, multistrain infections, and compliance failures lead to a vicious cycle of resistance build-up and reinfection.25 Infectivity does not differ from nonresistant strains, with cough and aerosoli-zation being the primary mode of transmission. Because of resistance, treatment of MDRTB requires the use of less potent and less tolerable second-line agents. In order to assure cure, treatment duration must be extended, typically to 18\u201324 months. Consequently, treatment failures are more common compared with non-MDRTB cases. Mortality rates for MDRTB presently range from 12% for persons not infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to 90% for HIV-positive individuals.26\n",

In some countries with high rates of HIV, limited healthcare resources, social stigmatization, lack of safe alternative nutrition sources, and poor infrastructure hinder prevention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal HIV transmission. Although perinatal HIV infection in the US has become rare because of available interventions, it is worth noting that because of many disparities in healthcare, including lack of knowledge of the importance of prenatal care, immigrant women are much more likely to present for delivery with unknown or positive HIV status, placing the infant at greater risk. Also, some immigrants and refugees are coming from areas of the world where HIV is highly endemic. At the time of migration, existing children in the family may be infected. With the reduction in mother-to-child transmission in the US, the pediatric HIV-infected cohort is rapidly aging.

The pathogens that are the threat of the future may be ones that were previously thought contained or even eradicated. They may be diseases long ignored because they no longer afflict those living in comfort in the developed world despite continuing to exact their toll among the disenfranchised. Or they may be newly identified as they emerge from the crevices of an ever-shrinking world. The challenge to healthcare providers and public health workers is to continue to advocate for basic healthcare for all and to be ever vigilant to the smoldering outbreak poised to become the next headline emerging disease.",
