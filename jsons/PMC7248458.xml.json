In many high income countries, the proportion of patients aged over 80 years has risen to 10\u201315% and is estimated to rise even further [1]. As the age of patients increases, we not only see more patients with increasing comorbidities and frailty but also increasing numbers of elderly patients with high functional status [2]. In addition, increasing numbers of children with corrected or supported congenital disorders are growing into adulthood. More ICU beds are required to treat all these growing populations.",

During the influenza pandemic of 2009, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was reserved for young otherwise healthy patients with respiratory failure. Today, indications have broadened and many more patients are eligible. Artificial organs and mechanical circulatory assist devices now offer long-term survival options to many patients in whom ICU care was previously not considered. Outside the ICU, the increasing availability of new anticancer therapies such as monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T cells and checkpoint inhibitors whose side effects may include severe organ failure is creating a growing cohort of patients who also need ICU admission. As a consequence, the increasing availability of all these treatments will result in greater demand for ICU care.",

Lack of access to ICU puts patients at risk through increased interhospital transfers, cancellation of surgery and premature or out-of-hours discharge from the ICU [13]. Without more ICU beds, increasing pressure to admit patients will exacerbate ICU strain and leaves us little capacity to cope with sudden surges in ICU demand. ICUs in many countries have been overwhelmed by patients with coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Lack of intensive care capacity has undoubtedly cost lives during the pandemic and will do again without greater baseline ICU capacity [14].",
