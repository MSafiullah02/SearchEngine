Since the virus was identified in Europe (Lelystad virus; Wensvoort et al., 1991) and in the USA (VR2332; Benfield et al., 1992, Collins et al., 1992), PRRSV has become a serious pathogen of swine herds world-wide (Rossow et al., 1999). PRRSV, along with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh et al., 1990, Plagemann and Moennig, 1992).",

Clues to the genetic basis of pathogenicity can be gleaned from comparison of the nucleotide sequence of a virulent parent viral strain with that of the cell-passaged attenuated variant. One such pair is the prototype North American isolate, strain VR-2332, and RespPRRS, its MA-104 cell adapted attenuated descendent. In this article, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of both strains of PRRSV and have deduced and characterized their nucleotide and protein differences. Several key amino acid changes between parental and vaccine strains were identified using this approach, but many other nucleotide and amino acid changes also occurred in genomic regions of unknown function. The nucleotide sequences were also compared to strain 16244B, which is claimed to be a virulent field revertant of RespPRRS (Allende et al., 2000). A full comparison of all three PRRSV strains shows that the origin of 16244B (\u2018Michelle\u2019 strain) is unclear.",

After 1 h of adsorption, the unattached virus was washed off of the cells and 5 ml of fresh cell medium (EMEM/10% FBS or DMEM/2% Swine Serum) was added. The culture was placed at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 0.5-ml aliquots of virus were removed and replaced with 0.5 ml fresh medium at 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h.

In order to determine the unresolved bases, we derived several clones of PCR products generated from different passages of VR-2332 and RespPRRS (Fig. 1\n). Initially, several standard 5\u2032-RACE were performed on passage 2 from the original VR-2332 field isolate brain homogenate, passage 31 of strain VR-2332 and passage 4 of RespPRRS vaccine strain (Frohman, 1994). Three different 5\u2032-terminal base patterns were elucidated, with added ambiguity due to the poly T tract added during the 5\u2032-RACE procedure, immediately preceding an apparent 18 base PRRSV sequence GACGUAUAGGUGUUGGC. Interestingly, heterogeneity at the 5\u2032-end was detected early during passaging of the original PRRSV field isolate, yet no heterogeneity was seen after viral plaque purification to produce strain VR-2332 (Fig. 1). Further analysis of PCR clones derived from 5\u2032-RACE experiments using poly (G) addition discriminated the remaining 5\u2032 terminal bases of strains VR2332 and RespPRRS. Only one additional base, corresponding to an adenine residue, was identified for strain VR-2332 (Fig. 1). Two additional bases, TA, were detected for the 5\u2032 terminal bases of four PCR clones derived from vaccine strain RespPRRS. The number of subsequent passages shown in Fig. 1 (2, 4, 12, 24, 31) indicates the relative stability of the cloned virus strains. These results are discordant with a recent report with respect to the first nucleotide of VR2332 and RespPRRS. Oleksiewicz and investigators reported a 5\u2032-terminal U in strain VR-2332 and lack of such in strain RespPRRS (Oleksiewicz et al. 1999), whereas we observed a 5\u2032-terminal U only in the RespPRRS vaccine strain. The complete leader sequence of RespPRRS vaccine strain shares 95.2% identity with another PRRSV vaccine strain, PrimePac PRRS (Shen et al., 2000) (data not shown).",

From the sequence data, we cannot determine exactly when the 5\u2032-terminal thymidine residue of strain RespPRRS was acquired during passaging. However, the possibility exists that strain RespPRRS has developed individual genomes of variable nucleotide sequence due to strain evolution over the course of more than 70 passages. The RespPRRS sequence which we derived from 3- to 7-fold coverage of the genome (AF066183) is somewhat different from the sequence of RespPRRS recently reported (Allende et al., 2000).",

The changes appeared throughout the genome (Table 1\n, Fig. 2\nA), except for ORF7 and the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), and no single ORF exhibited less than the 99% identity between parental and vaccine strains (Fig. 2B). Of the 44 altered nucleotides, 13 resulted in silent mutations such that the encoded protein was not changed. One of these 13 silent mutations resided in the 5\u2032-leader, 11 resided in ORF 1, and one silent change was detected in ORF3. The rest of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid changes in each of the remaining identified ORFs. Detailed analysis of the nucleotide changes, corresponding amino acid changes and potential coding domains are listed in Table 1. For ease of understanding, nucleotide numbering in Table 1 is based on the sequence of VR-2332 (1\u201315411). The 5\u2032-terminal uracil residue of strain RespPRRS is numbered as zero, and all site designations are one less than the value of the sequence deposited in GenBank.",

However, no conclusive evidence has been generated to demonstrate the presence of this potential leader protein. The leader sequence of RespPRRS suggested some virus heterogeneity. In one case (Table 1, mutation 2a), U36\u2192A36 (VR-2332\u2192RespPRRS) coded for a conservative change at amino acid 12 (F12Y). In the other case (Table 1, mutation 2b), the C63\u2192U63 nucleotide change, located in the third base of the 21st codon in this polypeptide sequence, is silent.

From the analysis of both VR-2332 and RespPRRS genomes, it was deduced that only four of the 15 ORF 1 specific nucleotide changes occurred in these identified domains. One mutation, a C1181\u2192U1181 transition, which would alter amino acid 331 of ORF 1 from a serine residue in strain VR-2332 to a phenylalanine in the attenuated strain RespPRRS (S331F), resulted in a non-conservative change located in the putative ORF1 cleavage product, nsp2 (den Boon et al., 1995, Allende et al., 1999, Allende et al., 2000, Nelsen et al., 1999). The second discernible mutation, a G5614\u2192A5614 transition, resulted in the semiconservative change of glutamic acid to lysine at ORF1 amino acid 1809. This mutation is compelling, because the alteration could render the predicted cleavage site E/G, located at the junction of nsp3 and nsp4, uncleavable by the putative serine protease located in nsp4. A third recognizable mutation, a U10533\u2192C10533 transition, resulted in a change from tyrosine to histidine within the helicase domain. The final ORF1 recognizable mutation was located in the coronavirus-like domain. In this instance, the transversion from G11329\u2192C11329 resulted in amino acid 3714 undergoing a non-conservative change from glycine to alanine. A glycine residue at this position, except for strain RespPRRS, has been shown to be conserved in all nidoviruses analyzed to date (Nelsen et al., 1999).",

Sequence analysis of strains VR-2332 and RespPRRS indicated that there were 15 nucleotide changes in this region, and all but one of which resulted in amino acid alterations. There were four amino acid mutations within GP2. One amino acid change (aa10, L\u2192F) was located within the predicted signal sequence of GP2, but the nucleotide mutation (G12102\u2192U12102) also altered amino acid 9 from an aspartic acid to a tyrosine of a putative ORF2a protein (Wu, Christopher-Hennings, and Nelson, unpublished data). The remaining three GP2 changes (aa 122, A\u2192S; aa 128, K\u2192R; aa 130, V\u2192M) were clustered in an eight amino acid region in the middle of the protein sequence, predicted to be located on the exterior of the virion. The three amino acid modifications that occurred in GP3 (aa 83, G\u2192E; aa 116, G\u2192S; aa 251, A\u2192T) and the two in GP4 (aa 69, C\u2192Y; aa 135, V\u2192A) also are predicted to lie on the exterior of the virion. All of these mutations but one are semi- or non-conservative changes. In the putative viral attachment protein GP5, two amino acids were altered during virus attenuation. One GP5 change occurred within the proposed signal sequence (aa 13, R\u2192Q) and the other change (aa 151, R\u2192G) is predicted to be located in the virion interior (Faaberg and Plagemann, 1995). GP5 has been shown to be disulfide linked to the M protein (Faaberg et al., 1995, Mardassi et al., 1996) and studies with a similar virus have revealed that this disulfide bond is critical to infectivity (Faaberg et al., 1995). While no mutations occurred in the extravirion region of GP5, one mutation did occur within the M protein (aa 16, Q\u2192E) predicted to be located on the outer surface of the virus. Although this M protein mutation was conservative, mutations in this critical region of the PRRSV viral attachment heterodimer could be important. However, analysis of the sixth in vivo backpassage of RespPRRS revealed that this mutation had reverted back to a VR-2332-like sequence while maintaining all other ORF 5 and 6 mutations and the avirulent viral phenotype (data not shown). The other M protein mutation was shown to be the result of two nucleotide changes within the codon for amino acid 121, altering the sequence from an arginine to a glycine (R\u2192G). Curiously, both carboxyl terminal GP5 and M mutations resulted in a R\u2192G change.",

Importantly, no instances were observed in which the three strains were all different from one another. If strain 16244B were in fact derived from a field reversion of RespPRRS, the data would imply that for 237 nucleotide mutations 16244B reverted back to the exact VR-2332 nucleotide sequence and in no instance would it have mutated to either of the two possible remaining bases. The likelihood of such a probability is exceedingly low. We also considered the possibility that strain 16244B resulted from a viral recombination event between strain RespPRRS and an unidentified but closely related field isolate. However, no region of considerable length was clearly identified as being derived from strain RespPRRS, which one would expect if viral recombination had taken place. Therefore, the origin of 16244B remains unclear.",

This represents a 0.28% variation during 70 passages in MA-104 cells. This rate of variation is comparable to other RNA viruses (Steinhauer and Holland, 1987) and suggests that PRRSV is not susceptible to inherently high spontaneous mutation rates in the absence of immunological and environmental pressures. This may explain the relative stability of strain VR-2332 when passaged alone in cell culture, as this report delineates. However, PRRSV has been shown to undergo high frequency recombination in the presence of two or more virus strains (Yuan et al., 1999) and appears to evolve rapidly in the presence of biological pressure.",

We have determined that our sequence of the RespPRRS strain is somewhat different from what has been previously reported (Allende et al., 2000), which brings additional complexity to the derivation of potential PRRSV attenuation sites. In addition, the 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides for both VR-2332 and RespPRRS are markedly different from those reported for strain 16244B. In our view, PRRSV attenuation sites may be genotype specific and variable, possibly resulting from a complicated interplay of genomic regions and viral and host specific factors. Postulation of attenuation sites can lead to interesting hypothesis-based experiments. However, a reverse genetics system for PRRSV must be produced and genetically altered at specific nucleotides in order to discern sites of attenuation.",
