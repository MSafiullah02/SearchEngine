Many patients spent over 2 hours at the clinic for a 15-minute appointment. A poor patient tracking system exacerbated this challenge, making it difficult to measure appointment length or to estimate workflow delays accurately. If a patient was not checked out in the system, it appeared as if they were in the clinic for several hours. This issue resulted in inaccurate data regarding appointment lengths. Furthermore, pediatric patients were often bored due to long waits.",

Longer wait time is negatively correlated not only with patient satisfaction but also with confidence in the provider and the perceived quality of care.14 Reduced wait times correspond to greater willingness to return and follow up with specialty care and improves pediatric patient health.2 Wait time also affects patient loyalty and the likelihood to recommend the clinic to others.3 Furthermore, related studies demonstrate that distractors in the waiting area improve the waiting experience for children.5 For example, art therapy programs are effective with other patient populations.6 For patients, their families, and providers, it is of utmost importance to increase efficiency and better the healthcare experience by reducing waits and providing engaging activities.",

Data analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.). We also counted the number of patients with recorded appointment lengths greater than 3 hours (due to tracking errors) to determine patient tracking efficacy. This metric indicated how many errors in the recording of time intervals occurred. Total appointment lengths over 3 hours were considered outliers and counted to quantify tracking errors.
