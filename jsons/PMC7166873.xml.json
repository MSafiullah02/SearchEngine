Monkeys housed in colonies experience multiple episodes of diarrhea that can affect the maintenance and use of these animals in biomedical research. Bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica species, and parasites, including Cryptosporidium, are common and are recognized causes of enteric infection in monkeys [19, 22], but the role of viral agents has been less clearly defined. No pathogens are identified in up to 69% of fecal specimens from episodes of diarrhea, and the rate of detection is especially low in neonates [19].",

Consequently, little is known about the epidemiology, prevalence and causal role of viral agents in diarrheal disease among monkeys. A surveillance study conducted 28 years ago found that 12% of the samples from captive Kenyan baboons in a primate colony contained enteroviruses and adenoviruses [17]. Despite their widespread prevalence, enteroviruses that grow well in the intestine are rarely associated with disease in monkeys [10], although adenoviruses are recognized as a cause of diarrhea in monkeys [22, 25]. Coronaviruses were common in normal and diarrhea stools of monkeys in two US colonies but no causal relationship with disease has been established [18, 23]. Monkeys have high prevalences of antibodies to rotaviruses, a major cause of infantile dehydrating diarrhea and to noroviruses, which cause major outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in humans [1, 9, 12, 15]. However, rotaviruses are rarely detected and are not considered a major cause of diarrhea in monkeys although two simian strains, SA11 and RRV, are the most widely used reference strains in laboratories worldwide [11, 13, 19, 22, 25]. Noroviruses have not yet been detected in monkeys.",

Because acute and chronic diarrhea is common in monkeys and poses a major problem for the management of primate facilities, we surveyed viral agents in fecal specimens of monkeys with diarrhea in the two major breeding and research colonies in China and the United States. We found a relatively high prevalence of enteroviruses and enteric adenoviruses in both colonies. These results are similar to those of an earlier study in which infections with enteroviruses and enteric adenoviruses were found to be common in captive normal and sick baboons in a Texas primate facility [17]. We did not detect rotaviruses in fecal specimens of monkeys with diarrhea in Georgia (Yerkes colony). This finding, together with results of our recent 2\u2010year survey [9], indicates that rotavirus is not a major cause of diarrhea among older moneys in the colony. A previous study also failed to identify rotavirus as a major cause of gastroenteritis in infant, juvenile and adult monkeys in a primate colony in California [25]. In contrast, rotaviruses were relatively common among monkeys with diarrhea in the Chinese colony and were exclusively associated with the presence of enteric adenoviruses in fecal specimens. Furthermore, by EM, rotaviruses appeared as empty and severely damaged particles, an observation that is supported by our failure to detect viral RNA by PAGE. It is an interesting and novel observation that group A rotaviruses appeared unstable and atypical in stools of monkeys with diarrhea. Whether this lack of particle stability explains the discrepancy in the detection of rotavirus and antibody in monkeys needs further investigation.",

We tried to confirm noroviruses by RT\u2010PCR using primers specific for human noroviruses [3, 8] but were not successful. Because of the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays (e.g. EIA and PCR) for simian noroviruses, the prevalence of noroviruses in monkeys remains unknown. Given the sensitivity of 105 to 106 particles/ml by EM [5], the concentration of this simian virus in original stools should be at least 106 viral particles. The detection of noroviruses is highly significant because we now can perform biochemical and molecular characterization of the virus and attempt to isolate it in cell culture. Furthermore, the availability of this simian virus may allow us to develop a challenge model to study the pathogenesis and immunity of norovirus diarrhea and to test potential human norovirus vaccines, similar to our recent rotavirus studies [28, 29].",

Future studies will examine the genetic and antigenic relatedness of this simian virus with other picobirnaviruses and to see if this virus might be pathogenic in monkeys. We also observed by EM coronaviruses in fecal specimens of monkeys with diarrhea from China. However, because we did not test all of the specimens by EM we were not able to reliably assess the prevalence of this virus in the primate colony. Of note, people with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that were first reported in China had diarrhea as a common clinical symptom [2, 24]. SARS coronavirus has been detected in the sewage from hospitals where SARS patients were treated [27]. Whether these simian coronaviruses are genetically related to human SARS coronaviruses needs to be investigated.

We determined the prevalence of rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses and enteroviruses utilizing the two relatively sensitive and specific commercial EIA kits and molecular diagnostic tools adapted from a previous study (21). While EIA Rotaclone detects both human and animal rotaviruses, Adenoclone\u2010Type 40/41 is intended for the detection of enteric adenovirus serotypes 40 and 41 in human fecal specimens. This means we might have missed other or previously unidentified simian adenoviruses. Because of the relatively high rate of mixed virus infection and the lack of fecal specimens from clinically healthy monkeys, we were not able to establish a causal relationship between a specific viral agent and diarrhea in these juvenile and adult monkeys. Additional studies should address the prevalence of these enteric viruses and their role in diarrheal disease among infant and young monkeys. We could not examine the seasonality of virus infection because fecal specimens were not collected every month. Whether our observation of a less diverse group of viral agents in the Yerkes colony reflects the shorter period of sample collection remains to be determined. Despite these limitations, this pilot study indicates that multiple enteric viruses circulate in monkeys with diarrhea in two major research primate colonies. The high prevalence of these viruses poses a serious problem for the management of breeding colonies and may have a negative and unforeseen influence on the nature and quality of data resulting from the use of these monkeys in biomedical research. Studies are under way to further characterize these diverse enteric viruses, including determination of species, serotypes, or genotypes for enteroviruses, enteric adenoviruses and noroviruses. There is also a need for sensitive and specific diagnostics that will further increase our understanding of the biology and evolution of simian enteric viruses and may lead to better management and prevention of acute and chronic diarrhea among monkeys in primate facilities.",
