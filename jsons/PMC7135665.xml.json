A study involving Finish patients aged 60 years or older found attack rates of 20 cases per 1000 persons annually [9].",

The atypical pathogens (M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, Legionnella spp) were found in 7% of patients younger than 80 years but in only 1% of patients older than 80 years [81]. In the elderly with comorbid conditions (cardiopulmonary, renal, hepatic, or central nervous system disease; diabetes; malignancy), infection with a gram-negative rod, such as an enterobacteriaceae or P aeruginosa, was more likely to occur and was more severe [83].",

It is the second most common cause of infection in this setting, has the highest mortality rate for any nursing-home\u2013acquired infection, and frequently results in the transfer of cases to the hospital for management. The overall incidence of nursing-home\u2013acquired pneumonia varies from 0.3 to 2.5 episodes per 1000 days of resident care [84], [85]. In a study by Muder [84], the most common etiologic agent in cases of nursing-home\u2013acquired pneumonia were S pneumoniae, followed by H influenzae (nontypeable) and M catarrhalis. The risk for invasive pneumococcal disease was fourfold higher for patients with nursing-home\u2013acquired pneumonia compared with patients with CAP [86]. With increasing age, the rate of oropharyngeal colonization by gram-negative rods increases. The incidence of aspiration also is higher in the nursing-home setting than in the community. It seems reasonable to assume that gram-negative rods would be important pathogens in nursing-home\u2013acquired pneumonia; however, a significant drawback to the study of such pneumonias is the fact that there is too much reliance on sputum cultures to establish the diagnosis. More carefully done studies are needed to define the cause and epidemiology of pneumonia in the elderly and in the nursing-home setting.",
