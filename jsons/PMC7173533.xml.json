Wheeze is the most frequent symptom of the variable airway obstruction that occurs in asthma. Clinical definitions are described in all pediatric asthma guidelines. For example, the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network2 and Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines3 emphasize the exclusion of other conditions causing wheeze, cough, or breathlessness, especially in the very young child. More recently, there has been a focus on clarifying the definition of wheezing in preschool children with two categories proposed: episodic viral wheeze and multiple trigger wheeze.4\n",

The latter may report a higher rate of symptoms than reported by the parent for the same adolescents.5, 6, 7 This may be caused by a greater awareness of milder symptoms in the adolescent, or symptoms occurring when the parent is not present and not reported to the parent. An asthma symptoms video questionnaire was developed in 1992 in response to possible translation problems with written questionnaires used between populations who speak different languages, some of whom have no word for wheeze. The video shows scenes of young people with asthma, thereby avoiding the need to describe symptoms verbally. The validity of the video has been investigated by comparison with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR),8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and most studies show a close relationship. Its relationship to the written questionnaire is close between populations,14 but within populations the prevalence estimates are lower with the video questionnaire,15 and its relationship within individuals is not clearcut.10,\n16, 17, 18, 19\n",

Most such studies have been within populations, but in 1985 the first study between centers in different countries was completed.30 This was followed by several other comparisons between populations, and then in 1992 the International Study of Asthma and Allergies (ISAAC) was established, a multiphase cross-sectional study that became the largest epidemiologic study of asthma in children ever undertaken.31 ISAAC used a simple standardized methodology with written and video questionnaires about asthma symptoms in Phases One and Three14,\n32,\n33 with a conventional cross-sectional study design. Phase Two, which used more intensive standardized modules to make comparisons between populations (centers), followed the cross-sectional design with case control analyses.34,\n35 Case control studies identify children with asthma and a control group of children without asthma, and then follow with a comparison of exposure of cases and controls to factors of interest (e.g., environmental tobacco smoke).",

In adolescents, self-reported prevalence of wheeze in the past 12 months (current wheeze) varied from 32.6% in Wellington (New Zealand) to 0.8% in Tibet (China). Thirty-five centers (15%) had a prevalence of current wheeze \u226520%, and these were mostly from the English language countries and Latin America. Twenty-two centers (9.4%) had a prevalence of <5%, and they were mostly in the Indian subcontinent, Asia Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, and Northern and Eastern Europe (Fig. 44-1\n). In children, parent-reported current wheeze ranged from 37.6% in Costa Rica to 2.4% in Jodhpur (India). Twenty-one centers (14.6%) had a prevalence of current wheeze \u226520%, and all but two were English language countries or Latin America. Seventeen centers (11.8%) had a prevalence of <5%, and these were mostly from the Indian subcontinent, Asia-Pacific, and Northern and Eastern Europe (Fig. 44-2\n).

In the United States, two studies have found differing results. In Arkansas, asthma prevalence was similar between representative rural and urban groups, but asthma morbidity was higher in the rural group.61 However, in Wisconsin, asthma was less commonly reported among farm-reared rural children than among non\u2013farm-reared rural children.62 Thus different aspects of the rural environment need exploration. Other studies of the effect of the farming environment on the occurrence of asthma, especially in European settings, suggest that microbial exposure may be a potentially protective effect resulting in low asthma prevalence in rural environments (see Infection, Immunization, and Microbial Exposure later in the chapter).63\n",

            "text": "Studies of migration have provided further evidence of powerful environmental influences on the occurrence of asthma, generally demonstrating an increase in prevalence when children migrate from low to high prevalence areas. In 1975 to 1976 in the first of these studies, Tokelauan children were observed in two environments. Asthma was more than twice more common among Tokelauan children in New Zealand than in Tokelau. Among children examined in New Zealand, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of asthma between those born in New Zealand and those born in Tokelau.64 Among Asian immigrants from Pakistan, India, and East Africa in Blackburn, U.K, there was an increasing rate of asthma symptoms with increasing duration of stay in the U.K.65 In Melbourne, Australia, the prevalence of wheeze was higher in Australian-born Asians and non-Asians than in Asian immigrants, and it was also strongly associated with length of stay in Australia.43 In the ISAAC Australia study, asthma prevalence was higher among Australian-born children than among those born elsewhere.66 In teenagers in Melbourne, Australia, there was an effect of length of residence on the prevalence of symptoms in subjects born outside Australia and now living in Melbourne.67 Children born in the United States were more likely than children born outside of the United States to have current asthma.68 A study in Israel showed that the prevalence of asthma symptoms was higher in native-born Israelis compared with Ethiopian immigrants, lower compared with immigrants from Western countries, and similar to immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The younger the age at which immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia arrived in Israel, the higher their prevalence of asthma at 17 years of age.69 Among Mexican Americans in the United States, children who were born in the United States had higher rates of asthma than their Mexican-born peers, and most were influenced by where they were born, age at immigration, and duration of U.S. residence.70, 71, 72 Most recently, in ISAAC Phase Three (a global study), adolescents who were immigrants had fewer symptoms of asthma than those born in their new country. The effect diminished with increasing duration of residence in the adopted country.73\n",

As these were the majority of centers who undertook ISAAC Phase One, this reflected the large worldwide interest in time trends of prevalence. Following reports from English language countries in the 1990s of increases in asthma prevalence from the 1980s, continuing increases in prevalence had been expected. However, in most high-prevalence countries, particularly the English language countries, the prevalence of asthma symptoms changed little between Phase One and Phase Three, and even declined in some cases.33 In contrast, a number of countries that had high or intermediate levels of symptom prevalence in Phase One showed significant increases in prevalence in Phase Three. Examples include Latin American countries (e.g., Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile) and Eastern European countries (e.g., the Ukraine and Romania). Other countries with significant increases in symptom prevalence included Barbados, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria. With the exception of India, all of the countries with very low symptom prevalence rates in Phase One reported increases in prevalence in Phase Three, though only the increases for Indonesia and China were statistically significant. The percentage of children and adolescents reported to have ever had asthma increased significantly, possibly reflecting greater awareness of this condition and/or changes in diagnostic practice.",

The prevalence of asthma increased in children 2- to 3-fold, but it may have flattened or even fallen recently while current trends in adult prevalence were flat. The prevalence of a lifetime diagnosis of asthma increased in all age groups. The incidence of new asthma episodes presenting to general practitioners increased in all ages to a plateau in the mid-1990s and declined since then. During the 1990s, the annual prevalence of new cases of asthma and of treated asthma in general practice showed no major change.93\n",

In preschool children in Sweden, the age-specific asthma prevalence from 1 to 6 years of age showed somewhat higher levels for boys than for girls.96 There are consistent reports of higher asthma symptom prevalence in school boys than girls. In adolescents, there is a mixed picture with considerable variation between countries, but, on average, prevalence in teenage girls is slightly higher than in teenage boys. These reports come from the United States,97 the United Kingdom,98 and from ISAAC Phase One in 156 centers in 56 countries in children 6 to 7 years of age and 13 to 14 years of age.14 In a cross-sectional study in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, asthma prevalence was more frequent and severe among girls than boys.99 A recent review of the literature confirmed these observations; they found that boys were consistently reported to have more prevalent wheeze and asthma than girls. In adolescence, the pattern changes and onset of wheeze is more prevalent in females than in males. A further recent study found that asthma, after childhood, is more severe in females than in males and is relatively underdiagnosed and undertreated in female adolescents.100 However, in contrast a very large study of Californian adolescent males and females exhibited nearly the same patterns of prevalence.101 The factors that influence the differences in gender-related expression of disease are not known, but suggestions include parental atopy,102 and hormonal changes with maturation.",

Paternal history was a stronger risk factor for wheeze in females than in males.102 In Aberdeen, Scotland, in four repeated cross-sectional studies over a 15-year period, the male-to-female ratio significantly narrowed for wheeze, partly caused by disappearance of the bias to diagnose asthma in symptomatic males but not in females, suggesting that other environmental factors enhancing the expression of asthma and atopy in females could be explored in future research.95\n",

It is not straightforward to separate socioeconomic influences from ethnicity, as commonly indigenous people and non-white ethnic groups are usually relatively socioeconomically disadvantaged compared with white groups. To illustrate this in a nationally representative U.S. sample of children 3 years of age, asthma prevalence declined with increasing income for non\u2013African-American but not African-American children.108 In New York children 4 to 13 years of age, asthma prevalence within different ethnic and income groups was consistently lower in neighborhoods of greater socioeconomic status, except among Puerto Rican children, who had high asthma prevalence, regardless of school attended or income.109 Differences in symptomatology may reflect differences in disease management,104 inequalities in access to care,94 or other factors. In the U.K. millennium cohort at 3 years of age, more Black Caribbean children and fewer Bangladeshi children reported ever asthma and recent wheeze compared with white children. After adjustments, the disadvantage in asthma and recent wheeze for Black Caribbeans was mostly explained by socioeconomic factors. However, for Bangladeshi children, asthma and wheezing illnesses appeared to be underreported, accounted for by the recentness of migration and low English language use, suggesting that potential explanations for observed differences may be different between ethnic groups.110 In a very large study of Californian adolescents, an increased risk was observed for asthma and BMI, and there were no substantial differences in this basic pattern found between the six examined racial/ethnic groups.101 Different types of risks may contribute to variations in asthma morbidity for urban children from specific ethnic groups with asthma whose health outcomes lag far behind their non-Latino white counterparts.111 These findings are reinforced by a conceptual model related to four main domains that has been developed to explain asthma health disparities in Latino children in the United States: the individual and family, the environment or context in which the child lives, the health care system, and provider characteristics (with potential mechanisms).112\n",

In those who wheezed at any time, over 12% had at least weekly wheeze-induced sleep disturbance. The rates were even higher in another multinational study.114 Rabe and colleagues114 surveyed over 3000 children and nearly 8000 adults with asthma across 29 countries including North America, Europe, and Asia. They reported at least weekly sleep disturbance in 20% to 50% of respondents (adults and children combined). Three other recent pediatric studies (United States and Australia) found rates of 20% to 50% over a 4-week period.116, 117, 118 Desager and coworkers sought to better characterize the ISAAC findings by combining a common pediatric sleep questionnaire with the ISAAC survey in Antwerp.119 They that found children with wheeze were much more likely to experience restless sleep (OR 5.0, p <0.001), daytime sleepiness (OR 3.8, p <0.001), and daytime tiredness (OR 5.1, p <0.01) compared with non-wheezers. Stores and colleagues studied sleep in children with asthma compared with matched controls utilizing questionnaires, neurocognitive testing, and polysomnography.120 They found that children with asthma had significantly more disturbed sleep with lower sleep efficiency and greater daytime sleepiness. In addition, they performed poorer at memory recall tasks and scored higher on depression and psychosomatic symptom scores. Many of these measures improved following adjustments in asthma therapy.",

Many studies have suggested a bidirectional relationship between mental and physical health in asthma operating at internal (psychoneuroimmunologic) and external (behavior and therapy adherence) levels.125 Children with asthma are more likely to experience anger, fear, frustration, anxiety, loneliness, and guilt than controls.126 It frequently restricts participation in sporting and social activities and may even limit choices such as family pets.126 Gender differences have been observed in both quality of life scores and how children adapt to the burden of asthma. Consistent with many reports, a recent Swedish study of children attending a specialist clinic found that quality of life scores were significantly poorer in girls than in boys, despite severe asthma being twice as common among the boys.126 Girls appear more likely to incorporate asthma and asthma therapy into their personal identities, while boys attempt to exclude or deny it.126\n",

Effectiveness depends on many factors such as access, education, understanding, adherence, affordability, and treatment efficacy. The introduction of medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) together with management strategies (e.g., asthma action plans) has been shown to affect the risk of admission and re-admission. Variability in hospital admissions between populations, regions, and over time is likely to be strongly influenced by the uptake and quality of prehospital care. Quality of ambulatory care, implementation of guidelines, written action plans, and inhaled corticosteroid usage all affect hospitalization rate.149, 150, 151, 152, 153\n",

For example, significant differences in bronchodilator responsiveness, probability of wheeze, and exacerbation rates have been seen comparing those homozygous for Arg16 with those homozygous for Gly16.\n212,\n213 Another gene, RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) causes chemotaxis and activation of several cell types involved in the asthmatic airway inflammatory response including eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, and T cells. A polymorphism for this gene has been described that is present at increased frequency in Taiwanese children with near-fatal asthma compared to those with mild to moderate asthma and compared with Taiwanese nonasthmatic children.214 Gene by environment interaction is likely to be important and is poorly accounted for in current research. For example, tobacco smoke exposure appears to influence the impact of the Arg16 and Gly16 alleles.212 While allele frequency does vary between ethnicities (e.g., the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor polymorphism Glu27 is much less common in African-American individuals), it remains unclear how much influence this has on ethnic differences in asthma severity, hospitalization, and mortality.212,\n215\n",

While individual studies varied, overall the risk associated with maternal, paternal, or sibling history of asthma was similar. The risk increased if more than one parent was affected. Similarly, a family history of atopy elevated asthma risk. An extension of family history studies, segregation analysis can yield more detailed relationships. Unsurprisingly, given current understandings of asthma genetics, segregation studies have come to varying conclusions regarding inheritance: mixed, co-dominant, single locus, and polygenic.235 Among the phenotypic characteristics examined, total IgE appears most likely to be majorly influenced by a single gene, although the inheritance remains unclear.235 As noted, substantial differences in prevalence exist by region, by ethnicity, and over time. While it is unlikely that genetics explains the rapid changes observed in the last half century, it may contribute to some of the ethnic disparity given different frequencies of gene polymorphisms. Numerous twin studies in asthma have been published utilizing self-report diagnosis, IgE and allergy testing, and lung function tests.235 They attribute 36% to 75% of the variance in asthma risk to genetics.",

Candidate gene association, genome-wide linkage, and, most recently, genome-wide association (GWA) studies, largely utilizing case-control cohorts, have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with asthma and/or aspects of asthma control. Well over 100 genes have been associated with asthma or atopy-related phenotypes, with at least 40 replicated in two or more independent samples.237, 238, 239, 240, 241 For example, ADAM33 is thought to alter the hypertrophic response of bronchial smooth muscle to inflammation. While the associations may be strong, the individual effects sizes (\u223codds ratio) are generally small (OR 0.5 to 1.5), and future research will need to determine not only the functions of identified polymorphisms but also how they interact with each other and the environment.237 It remains to be seen how many of these prove to be true susceptibility genes. In contrast to the linkage studies, GWA permits research that is not hypothesis-driven and therefore the potential discovery of totally novel genes and/or pathophysiology. In these studies, the genomes of large numbers of individuals within a case-control cohort can be examined seeking associations between asthma phenotypes and individual genes. The first GWA study in childhood asthma, published in 2007 lead to the discovery of three polymorphisms (including ORMDL3) on Chromosome 17p21. These findings have been confirmed in other studies across diverse ethnic populations.242 While the mechanisms are still to be elucidated, they are strongly associated with an early-onset asthma that remits in early adulthood.243 As asthma phenotypes are age-related, achieving understanding of its genetic etiology may prove difficult with cross-sectional studies, and long-term longitudinal genetic studies will likely be required.244\n",

The proposed process is that allergen exposure produces allergic sensitization and that continual exposure leads to clinical asthma through the development of airways inflammation, BHR, and reversible airflow obstruction. Various measures of atopy (e.g., positive skin-prick tests, elevated serum IgE levels, parental history of asthma) are associated with an increased risk of developing asthma.246 For example, in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (Arizona, U.S.), when compared with children who had not wheezed, a larger proportion of children with persistent wheezing were more likely to have mothers with a history of asthma, elevated serum IgE levels at 9 months of age, or positive skin skin-prick tests for aeroallergens. Positive skin-prick tests for aeroallergens were also associated with an increased risk of late-onset wheezing.246 In Avon, U.K., in the ALSPAC study, at 7 years wheezing onset after 18 months was most strongly associated with atopy and airway responsiveness.247 Atopy causes an increased risk for persistence and severity of asthma, and this is discussed in the Natural History section later in the chapter.",

However, an increased rate of symptomatic cold and asthma episodes in atopic children was associated with considerable cumulative prolongation of BHR, which might help explain the role of atopy as a risk factor for asthma persistence.248 Sly has proposed a two-hit model for asthma in which airway inflammation triggered by viral infection or allergy during postnatal lung growth disrupts underlying tissue differentiation programs, leading to anomalies in respiratory function, which last for long periods later in life. Although both allergy and respiratory infections during early life are independently associated with risk for subsequent development of asthma, the highest odds ratios for persistent asthma are seen in children who have both.249\n",

A recent systematic review found that although there is an increased risk of developing asthma after eczema in early childhood, only one in three children with eczema develops asthma during later childhood.250 This is lower than previously assumed. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the risk of subsequent childhood asthma is not increased in children with early atopic dermatitis who are not also early wheezers, suggesting that a co-manifestation of phenotypes rather than a progressive atopic march may be the explanation.251\n",

These results suggest that selective avoidance and removal of pets leads to distortion of cross-sectional associations of pet ownership and respiratory allergy and disease among children.268 In a prospective study in Oslo, Norway, in children 10 years of age, no risk modification was seen for dog allergens.269 In adolescents in Norway, sensitization to pet allergens (i.e., cat, dog, and horse) was associated with increased BHR in children with asthma, but it did not increase the risk of being sensitized to pet allergens.270 In Sweden, early exposure to cats and dogs appeared to have a protective effect on the development of IgE sensitization.271 However, in a study in New Delhi, India, dogs and cats at home were significant risk factors associated with the symptoms of asthma in schoolchildren.272 Nonallergic effects of exposure to animals are discussed in the Housing, Animals, and Climate section later in the chapter.",

In the setting of occupational asthma in adults, continuing exposure to the relevant occupational allergen is generally associated with a higher risk of persisting asthma, although the relationship may be more complex than this.278 Exposure-response relationships may be influenced by properties of the allergen or route of exposure, the genotype of the exposed individual, and environmental agents (e.g., endotoxin). Recommendations have been made to reduce exposure for young children already sensitized to HDM, pets, or cockroaches to prevent the onset of allergic disease, and to eliminate or reduce the exposure of asthma patients who are allergic to indoor allergens (e.g., HDM, cockroaches, and animal danders) to improve symptoms and to control and prevent exacerbations.254 This might be achieved by chemical, physical, and combined methods of reducing mite allergen levels. However, a recent Cochrane Systematic Review that assessed the effects of reducing exposure to house dust mite antigens in the homes of people with mite-sensitive asthma found no effect of the interventions on number of patients whose asthma improved, asthma symptom scores, or medication usage. If any further trials are done, they need to be larger and more methodologically rigorous and must use other methods than those used so far, with careful monitoring of mite exposure and relevant clinical outcomes.279 These findings suggest that reducing allergen exposure is unlikely to make an important impact on the burden of asthma in populations.",

In a study from Israel 17-year-old adolescents had a higher risk of asthma if they had birth weights less than 2500 grams, but the mechanisms were not clear.282 In a U.S. nationally representative sample, the prevalence of childhood asthma decreased as birthweight increased.283 The relationship between low birth weight and asthma needs to be explored further, especially with studies from developing countries.",

The method of defining obesity needs consideration. Body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, and skinfold thickness produce relatively comparable results when analyzing the interaction between obesity and asthma.290 Prospective studies consistently support a link between obesity and reported wheezing or asthma diagnosis in children. However, there are still no clear explanations for such a link, and many different mechanisms may underlie the association. Obesity can be associated with symptoms commonly attributed to asthma, such as wheezing, dyspnea, and sleep apnea. Obese subjects are less fit and may have more frequent bouts of breathlessness on exertion accompanied by an exaggerated symptom perception. Some authors suggest that physicians should be cautious about diagnosing asthma in obese children on the basis of self-reported symptoms alone and should confirm the diagnosis by using objective measurements and evaluations of markers such as lung function parameters, bronchial hyper-reactivity, atopic sensitization, and indices of lung inflammation that can better identify asthma phenotype and exclude overdiagnosis.291 It is unclear, however, whether obesity merely exacerbates the asthmatic symptoms, creates susceptibility to onset of asthma, or develops concurrently with the respiratory disease. Obesity could have potential biological effects on lung function and systematic inflammation while also sharing certain comorbidities and etiologies with asthma.292 Atopic sensitization and bronchial hyperreactivity do not explain the observed associations. After puberty, the association between asthma and obesity tends to be stronger in girls than in boys. It is conceivable that severe obesity in adolescent females may aggravate asthma through mechanisms different from those linking prepubertal obesity to unremitting asthma in males.293\n",

More remains to be learned about the role of sociodemographic factors underlying this relationship.311\n",

A wide range of cross-sectional studies has been done on the relationship of antioxidants with asthma. Vitamin C, \u03b2 carotene, magnesium, and selenium were associated with a reduction in asthma prevalence325, 326, 327, 328, 329 and may prevent or limit an inflammatory response in the airways by reducing reactive oxygen species and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Flavonoids also may be potential antiallergic substances,330 and a recent study on enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems in childhood asthma suggested that antioxidant defenses (e.g., glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) were lowered in asthmatic children.331 However, not all studies on the role of antioxidants have been positive. A meta-analysis determined that dietary intake of antioxidants vitamins C and E and \u03b2 carotene does not significantly influence the risk of asthma.332 The potential role of antioxidants as supplements has been explored333 but a number of studies have been inconclusive.334 Overall, supplementation studies have suggested a minor role for individual antioxidants in asthma prevention.335 Several cross-sectional studies have indicated an inverse association between consumption of fruits and vegetables and symptoms of asthma, though the particular foods and symptoms varied.336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341 However, a smaller study of Dutch children found no clear association between fruit and vegetable intake and asthma symptoms.342 Ecological analysis of ISAAC Phase One data involving 53 countries found an inverse association between asthma symptoms and food of plant origin.343 In ISAAC Phase Two, fruit intake was associated with a low prevalence of current wheeze, and in nonaffluent countries with cooked green vegetables.314\n",

In 1997, Black and Sharpe cited evidence that contradicted the antioxidant hypothesis, instead proposing that the increase in asthma prevalence may have stemmed from an increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a decreased consumption of saturated fat.350 The Omega-6 PUFAs may particularly have a role in regulating immune response and inflammation. These PUFAs are found largely as linoleic acid in foods such as margarine and vegetable oils, which have risen in consumption with Westernization.351 Linoleic acid is a precursor of arachidonic acid that is converted into prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which inhibits interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and promotes an inflammatory environment that favors asthma development. Meanwhile, Omega-3 PUFAs may have an anti-inflammatory role. Thus, the increase in Omega-6 PUFA consumption and the decrease in Omega-3 PUFA consumption may immunologically increase the susceptibility of the population, although PUFAs may have other immunosuppressive mechanisms that require further study.352 Investigation of the lipid hypothesis found mixed results. A number of cross-sectional studies showed beneficial associations between foods containing Omega-3 PUFAs and asthma,353 but studies on cord blood PUFA composition and development of atopic disease have been inconclusive.354 There have been conflicting reports on the relationship between levels of PUFAs and wheeze. PUFA derived from vegetables in the ISAAC ecological analysis was associated with decreased symptom prevalence,343 supporting the hypothesis that it is industrially-derived PUFA that is responsible, rather than naturally derived PUFA from vegetables.322,\n355 Disappointingly, intervention studies have not found consistent results nor provided sufficient support for dietary supplementation with PUFAs.322,\n352,\n356, 357, 358\n",

The higher prevalence of asthma in Westernized countries might be linked to the fact that people spend much more time indoors and away from sunlight. Observational studies in the United States and the United Kingdom have reported that maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy was associated with lung function, suggesting that increased vitamin D in maternal diet may reduce risk of wheeze and other symptoms of asthma.362,\n363 As with other hypotheses, further investigation would be appropriate, especially in pregnancy.",

In 2002, no advantages were found in a randomized controlled trial eliminating cow's milk and eggs in the last trimester.401,\n402 Devereux and colleagues found that increased maternal intake of vitamin E was associated with decreased proliferation of cord blood mononuclear cells in response to allergens, suggesting a potential beneficial effect of maternal nutrition against atopy.403 Two maternal antioxidant studies showed an inverse relationship of antioxidants vitamin E, vitamin C, and zinc with wheeze.404,\n405 The selenium status of a cohort of 2000 pregnant mothers was also inversely associated with wheezing in the child,406 but this disappeared after the 5 years of age. One study of maternal PUFA intake found that maternal oily fish consumption during pregnancy was protective for childhood asthma, particularly in children who have asthmatic mothers.407 In keeping with many other diet studies, however, a longitudinal study of maternal consumption of various food types found no association between fish intake and asthma outcomes in children,408 despite another study suggesting an association.409 There was also no association between asthma and maternal consumption of foods such as vegetables, egg, and dairy. In contrast to the more specific antioxidant and vitamin D studies, the effect of broader food groups on asthma outcomes seems less significant.410 However a protective effect of a high level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet during pregnancy was found against asthma-like symptoms at 6 years of age.411 There is an obvious need for more randomized controlled trials of interventions on maternal diet using nutrients and factors that have the potential to impact the intrauterine environment and fetal immune and lung development.412\n",

It contains many agents that have pathologic effects on human tissues.413 Children can be exposed to tobacco smoke before or after birth. It has been difficult to isolate the effects on asthma of intrauterine exposure per se, as postnatal exposure continues in many instances. Does prenatal ETS cause allergic sensitization? No correlation was found between cord blood IgE of newborns and an active smoking history of either mothers or fathers.414,\n415 However, cord blood eosinophil counts were found to correlate with the urinary cotinine levels of mothers.416 In the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (Arizona), maternal prenatal but not postnatal smoking was associated with current wheeze at 3 years of age only.417 A recent Taiwanese study found that prenatal and household ETS exposure had significant adverse effects on respiratory health in Taiwanese children.418 Passive exposure of pregnant women to ETS during the third trimester in a Greek study was positively associated with asthma- and allergy-related symptoms in their preschool-age children.419\n",

Maternal smoking was associated with an increased incidence of wheezing illness up to 6 years of age (pooled odds ratio 1.31), but less strongly thereafter (1.13). The pooled odds ratio for asthma prevalence from 14 case-control studies was 1.37 if either parent smoked. Four studies suggested that parental smoking is more strongly associated with wheezing among \u201cnon-atopic\u201d children. Indicators of disease severity, including symptom scores, attack frequency, medication use, hospital attendance, and life-threatening bronchospasm were, in general, positively related to household smoke exposure. The excess incidence of wheezing in smoking households appears to be largely in early wheezers with a relatively benign prognosis, but among children with established asthma, parental smoking is associated with more severe disease. These studies suggest that ETS is a cofactor provoking wheezing attacks, rather than causing the underlying asthmatic tendency.421\n",

Community opinion may need to shift further in favor of protecting children and others from ETS before minimal interventions can be successful. This will require continued efforts by the medical and public health establishments, combined with legislation mandating tobacco-free public places and ETS-related media campaigns.427\n",

Many children with asthma experience deterioration of their symptoms associated with increases in outdoor air pollution.432 However, there is no evidence for increased air pollution contributing to increased prevalence of asthma.433 In ISAAC Phase One, a weak inverse relationship was demonstrated between city-level air pollution with particulate matter \u226410 microns (PM10) and symptoms of asthma, even after controlling for GNP, which has a strong inverse association with air pollution.434 Meta-analyses of data from countries with multiple centers found by contrast a consistent pattern of weak positive associations. These generally weak associations were in line with existing ecological evidence on the association between particulate air pollution and asthma. This finding is not incompatible with the extensive evidence from individual-level studies that air pollution may aggravate existing asthma, since this may not have an important effect on prevalence. The effects of air pollution may be modulated by stress. In a prospective cohort study in southern California, children from stressful households were more susceptible to the effects of traffic-related pollution and in utero tobacco smoke on the development of asthma.435 Short-term fluctuations in pollutant levels may have different effects from chronically high concentrations. Neither does it exclude a causal role for roadside exposure for which there is limited evidence. Thus there is little evidence that outdoor air pollution increases the risk for development of asthma and allergy.",

However, IgE-sensitization, symptoms of IgE-mediated diseases, and BHR were not associated with these pollutants.436 In a study in Swiss schoolchildren, there was no association between long-term exposure to air pollution and asthmatic and allergic symptoms.437 On the other hand, a cohort study of children in Japan identified increasing prevalence of bronchitis, wheeze, and asthma with increasing indoor NO2 exposure among girls, but not boys. Increased incidence of asthma was also identified among children living in areas with high outdoor NO2 concentrations.438 In Latin America, a high prevalence of asthma was found in heavily polluted S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with symptom rates comparable to less polluted cities in Australia and New Zealand.439 Accurately modeled urban air pollution in France was associated with some measures of childhood asthma.440 Although the current U.S. standard for ozone is based on short-term exposure, a recent cross-sectional study suggests that chronic (12-month) exposure to ozone and particles is related to asthma outcomes among children in metropolitan areas throughout the United States.441 In South Durban, South Africa, increased lower respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing, chest tightness or heaviness, and shortness of breath) were strongly and consistently associated with prior-day fluctuations in ambient levels of both SO2 and PM10.442 In western Morocco, air pollution was a determinant factor but is not the only factor increasing the risk of asthma in children; other factors (e.g., respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, genetics, and passive smoking) present a high-risk threat.443 In a study in Puerto Rico, proximity to some air pollution sources was associated with increased risks of asthma attacks.444 In Argentina, a relationship was found between higher exposure to photochemical pollutants and high prevalence or risk of asthma symptoms.445 In southern California communities, respiratory health in children was adversely affected by local exposures to outdoor NO2 or other freeway- related pollutants.446\n",

Traffic-related pollutants were associated with the highest risks. These data support the hypothesis that early childhood exposure to air pollutants plays a role in development of asthma.463 In children from participants in the Southern California prospective cohort, markers of traffic-related air pollution were associated with the onset of asthma. The risks observed suggest that air pollution exposure contributes to new-onset asthma.464\n",

Strachan proposed that allergic diseases could be \u201cprevented by infection in early childhood transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children. Later infection or reinfection by younger siblings might confer additional protection against hay fever.\u201d468 The hypothesis that was proposed about hay fever has been widely applied to asthma, with little evidence. The first decade of the hygiene hypothesis was twice reviewed by Strachan.469,\n470 Let Strachan have the last word on the hygiene hypothesis:\u201cThe hygiene hypothesis remains a credible but nonspecific explanation for observed variations over time, place and persons at risk for developing atopic allergic disorders. More prospective studies are needed to unravel which infectious agents exert a protective effect and the time period of importance for sensitization. The clinical implications of these advances in our understanding of the etiology of atopic allergic disorders are currently limited.\u201d470\n",

A study of children enrolled in the longitudinal cohort study, the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (Arizona) showed that RSV lower respiratory tract infections before 3 years of age were associated with an increased risk of infrequent wheeze and frequent wheeze at 6 years of age. Risk decreased with age and was not observable at 13 years of age.479 RSV-positive children younger than 5 years of age with asthma had a longer duration of illness prior to hospital presentation than RSV-negative children but were not more likely to be admitted or to have a longer duration of ongoing symptoms.180 The relationship between RSV lower respiratory tract infections in early childhood and asthma has been the subject of much debate. Some cohort studies have failed to identify a link between early RSV infection and atopic asthma. Cohort studies focusing on wheezing in early childhood have indicated that this is associated with an increased incidence of atopic asthma, but that this risk is not increased by RSV infection. Indeed, wheeze associated with rhinovirus infection may be a better marker for possible asthma. In contrast, there is no increased risk of atopic disease in infants with RSV acute bronchiolitis. These studies confirm earlier suggestions that the phenotype of respiratory illness and hence the host response rather than the infecting organism is the best predictor of the future pattern of respiratory illness.480\n",

A large cross-sectional study in the United States found that DTP or measles vaccine appeared to increase the risk of asthma ever, but not wheezing in the last 12 months.496 Other studies have found that immunization has no effect or even a protective effect on IgE-mediated disease. In a large prospective cohort study in the United Kingdom, there was no increased risk for wheezing illnesses in pertussis-vaccinated children.497 In a randomized double-blind controlled trial of the pertussis vaccine in Sweden, the cumulative incidence of IgE-mediated disease was similar in the three vaccination and placebo groups.486 In a large Canadian study, a negative association between delay in administration of the first dose of whole-cell DPT immunization in childhood and the development of asthma was found; the association was greater with delays in all of the first three doses. The mechanism for this phenomenon requires further research.498 A U.K. study provided no evidence of an association between vaccination against pertussis in infancy and an increased risk of later wheeze or asthma, and it does not support claims that vaccination against pertussis might significantly increase the risk of childhood asthma.499 American ecological data do not show associations between changes in childhood vaccine exposures and asthma prevalence.500 A meta-analysis of observational studies did not support an association, provocative or protective, between receipt of the BCG or whole-cell pertussis vaccine and risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence.501 However in a historical cohort in England, a potentially protective effect of neonatal BCG vaccination and asthma symptom prevalence was found.502 Moreover a meta-analysis of BCG vaccine in early life supported the hypothesis that exposure to the BCG prevents asthma, possibly through a modulation of the immune maturation process.503\n",

One study from Africa found a significantly decreased development of IgE-sensitization in children in whose homes pigs were kept.518 Bacterial endotoxin is known to induce production of Th1-associated cytokines, interferon \u03b3, and interleukin 12 and therefore has the potential to decrease allergen sensitization. Reductions in allergen sensitization and IgE-mediated disease have been found in children of farmers; children with pigs, dogs, or cats in their homes; children raised in daycare from an early age; and children of large families. An intriguing notion for further exploration is whether endotoxin could reduce the clinical expression of atopy. To date there is no evidence to support this, but observational studies and randomized trials to test this hypothesis would be of interest.519 In the Boston Home Allergens and Asthma Study,520 a longitudinal analysis of wheezing in young children and the independent effects of early-life exposures to house dust endotoxin, allergens, and pets suggests that the timing, dose, and other environmental factors may be important. In this study, the investigators found that higher levels of endotoxin were associated with increased risk of wheezing initially, but this risk rapidly decreased with time. The protective effects of cat and dog ownership were independent of the endotoxin level.",

Cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies that have been conducted in children show a small increased risk of having asthma symptoms if the home has damp or mold. However the potential benefits of reducing mold in the home have not been investigated. In a study in the Netherlands, sensitization to HDM and possibly mold allergen is related to living in a damp home and childhood respiratory symptoms.529 In a study of U.S. children, dampness in the home was common and a predictor of wheeze and asthma.530 In a population study in Israel, viable molds were common but IgE-sensitization to molds was a poor predictor of development of allergic symptoms. However, allergy to molds in atopic subjects increases the risk of symptomatic allergic disease.531 In a study in children in London, there was no significant difference in the degree of bronchospasm measured from children in homes with or without mold, but wheeze in the last year was associated with reported dampness and mold.532 In a small study of children in southern California, the degree of atopy and reactivity to mold and pollens played a significant role in asthma severity in asthmatic children.533 In a cohort study in Taiwan with assessment of exposure before the onset of asthma, exposure to molds had independent influence on the development of asthma.534 In another Taiwanese study, visible mold on the walls was associated with seasonality of childhood asthma in Taiwan.535 In a small study in Turkey, indoor molds had no effect on the symptoms of patients with asthma and/or rhinitis monosensitized to molds.536 However, simultaneous estimation of relative humidity in bedrooms and recordings of ambient temperature and humidity showed no association with respiratory symptoms.537 Nevertheless, it seems prudent to reduce or avoid damp housing conditions.254\n",

This hypothesis was explored in an ecological analysis of ISAAC Phase One data from 52 countries using Gross National Product (GNP) as a marker of economic development of countries. A weak positive association was found between GNP and symptoms of asthma; an increase of $10,000 per capita was associated with a 3% increase in the prevalence of wheeze.571 However within Latin America, ISAAC suggested a reverse trend, with prevalence of symptoms of asthma tending to be higher in poorer areas.439 Further supportive evidence of this association was found recently in ISAAC Phase Three, where data from 98 countries showed that the prevalence of asthma symptoms showed a positive relationship with Gross National Income (GNI), although the prevalence of severe symptoms correlated inversely with GNI.32 However caution should be used in interpreting the findings because of the great inequalities in income distribution within almost all countries in developing regions of the world. GNP represents the total economic activity of the country, reflecting mean wealth rather than median wealth. Thus countries with a highly skewed income distribution caused by concentration of wealth in the hands of a small fraction of the population may have a relatively high per capita GNP, while the majority of citizens have a relatively low level of income.572 A further consideration is that GNP does not measure factors that affect quality of life, such as the quality of the environment.",

            "text": "Within countries, some studies have shown that severe asthma symptoms in developed countries are more frequent in poorer sections of society.573 However in a prospective British cohort, high socioeconomic status was related to persistence of wheeze at 16 years of age.281 In a national birth cohort study from England, Wales, and Scotland, the prevalence of asthma showed no social class gradient.574 In Cardiff, Wales, social deprivation was not related to asthma prevalence, but was related to admission to hospital.575 A South African study had a similar finding with severity measured by high symptom occurrence.576 In a cross-sectional study in Italy, socioeconomic conditions were associated with hospitalization for asthma and were severity and weakly associated with prevalence, with the association being strongest for individual indicators (parental education) rather than area-based indicators.577 Poorer disease management is the postulated mechanism. In Auckland, New Zealand, there were higher lifetime and current prevalence rates of wheeze in children in lower socioeconomic status groups.578 In Brazil, the prevalence of asthma increased with poorer sanitation and with higher infant mortality at birth and at survey year, Gini coefficient (as a measure of income inequality within the country) and external mortality, and in contrast, asthma prevalence decreased with higher illiteracy rates.579 However, another study in Brazil found that the prevalence of asthma and related symptoms is quite variable and independent of socioeconomic status.580 In Santiago, Chile, a higher maternal education level was associated with lower prevalence of wheeze in the last 12 months.581 In Canada, disparities in asthma control between children from families of different socioeconomic status persist, even with adjustment for utilization of primary care services and use of controller medications.582 In a nationally representative U.S. sample of children 3 years of age, asthma prevalence declined with increasing income for non\u2013African-American but not African-American children.108 Among New York children 4 to 13 years of age, children living in predominantly low socioeconomic status communities had a 70% greater risk of current asthma, independent of their own ethnicity and income level. Asthma prevalence within different ethnic and income groups was consistently lower in neighborhoods of greater socioeconomic status, except among Puerto Rican children, who had high asthma prevalence regardless of school attended or income.109 In another study, U.S. non-Hispanic African-American children were at substantially higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children only among the very poor. The influence of neighborhood environment on childhood asthma in a non\u2013inner-city setting (Rochester, Minnesota) was small to modest.583\n",

They found that wheeze was a very common experience such that one third of children had at least one episode before 3 years of age. Wheeze prevalence was 32% in the first year, 17% in the second year, and 12% in the third. Of those who wheezed before 3 years of age, 60% were wheeze-free at 6 years of age. The authors grouped children as \u201cnever wheezed\u201d (52%), \u201ctransient early wheezing\u201d (20%), \u201cpersistent wheezing\u201d (14%), and \u201clate-onset wheezing\u201d (15%). Transient wheezers were more likely to have mothers who smoked, had evidence of early airway narrowing, and generally wheezed in association with viral infection. Persistent wheezers were more likely to have a family history of asthma, elevated IgE, and normal early airway caliber. In contrast, others subsequently found early airflow limitation at 4 weeks of age was associated with an increased risk of childhood airway responsiveness and wheeze.588 The Tucson study reinforced the concept of different childhood asthma phenotypes, that many children \u201cgrow out of\u201d asthma, and that the different phenotypes may be predictable based on risk factors. Other cohort studies have had similar findings.589 Children in the Tucson study with persistent wheezing have significantly reduced lung function at 6 years of age. The authors believed that the poorer lung function was not congenital, but rather the result of persistent airway inflammation.",

At subsequent reviews up until 42 years of age, there was no evidence of any further divergence in lung function between those with ongoing symptoms, frequent or severe symptoms, and those without. Authors speculated as to whether the initial fall followed by stability was the result of the introduction of regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy.

Follow-up of children in the Tucson study had similar results. Those characterized as persistent wheezers at 6 years of age had poorer lung function at both 6 and 16 years of age than the those who had never wheezed. However, again there was no evidence of progressive divergence between the groups during childhood.

RBM thickening, absent at 12 months, is present by a median of 29 months in those with recurrent wheeze.592,\n595,\n596 It is a consistent finding in children with severe or difficult asthma. It is not clear whether remodeling is reversible. These findings are of concern and lead to a different model for asthma with persistent and potentially progressive airway changes rather than simply reversible bronchospasm. Adding to this concern, the latest review of the Melbourne cohort reported that at 50 years of age, individuals who had been classified with severe asthma at 6 years of age had 37 times the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with controls.597 The risk was also elevated for those with original diagnoses of persistent asthma (OR 9) and intermittent asthma (OR 3) but was not elevated for those with mild viral-induced wheeze. Again, they reported no acceleration in lung function decline.",
