(Interval number) An interval number A is represented by closed interval [a l , a u ] and defined byA = [a l , a u ] = {x|a l \u2264 x \u2264 a u , x \u2208 R}, where R isthe set of real numbers and a l , a u are the lower and upper limits of the interval numbers, respectively. The interval number [a, a] represents a real number a. The arithmetic operations for any two interval numbers A = [a l , a u ] and B = [b l , b u ] are as follows: Addition: A + B = [a l , a u ] + [b l , b u ] = [a l + b l , a u + b u ]. Subtraction:A \u2212 B = [a l , a u ] \u2212 [b l , b u ] = [a l \u2212 b l , a u \u2212 b u ]. Scalar multiplication: \u03b1A = \u03b1[a l , a u ] = [\u03b1a l , \u03b1a u ], where \u03b1 is a positive real number. Multiplication: AB = [a l , a u ][b l , b u ] = [min{a l b l , a u b l , a l b u , a u b u }, max{a l b l , a u b l , a l b u , a u b u }]. Division: A/B = [a l , a u ]/[b l , b u ] = [a l , a u ][ 1 b l , 1 b u ]. Definition 2.2. (Interval-valued function) Let a > 0, b > 0. If the interval is of the from [a, b]",
