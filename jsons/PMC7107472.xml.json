The symposium also served as an opening event to announce the establishment of the Caroline Breese Hall, MD Endowment for Infectious Diseases at the University of Rochester Medical Center, which will provide salary support for a promising fellow or junior faculty member at the University working in Infectious Diseases. The endowment was established as a gift from the Hall family.",

She completed a residency in Pediatrics and a fellowship in Infectious Diseases at Yale University. Along with her husband Dr. William Hall, Dr. Caroline Breese Hall joined the faculty at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) in 1971, with appointments in both Pediatrics and Internal Medicine. She was appointed Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine in 1986.\n",

Early in her career, she carried out studies that defined the diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, and therapy of RSV bronchiolitis in children [\n8\u201320\n]. Later, when HHV6 was identified as the cause of roseola, she initiated studies that defined the clinical spectrum of HHV6 infection, and she attempted to understand the relationship between chromosomal integration and vertical transmission of the virus [\n21\u201326\n]. At the same time, few pediatric pathogens escaped her focus and interest, and Dr. Hall contributed and collaborated on many works concerning group A streptococci, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, rotaviruses, and noroviruses [\n27\u201338\n].\n",

She was a founding member of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS), its fifth president and Society Historian, and she also served for many years on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Infectious Diseases (Red Book Committee) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Caren was often sought out to serve on the most important national committees, including those of the Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Science, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), AAP, PIDS, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), and other professional societies.

Plotkin, Emeritus Professor, University of Pennsylvania, Executive Advisor, Sanofi Pasteur, and Principal of VaxConsult, LLC; Dr. Plotkin was accompanied by his wife and partner in VaxConsult, vaccine historian Susan Plotkin. Dr. Plotkin's review updated some of his past sage comments, touching upon those infections eradicated from the globe (smallpox and rinderpest), those with ongoing struggles for elimination or control (eg, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella), and those still to be successfully prevented by vaccination (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], dengue, malaria) [\n39\u201346\n]. He characterized the key problems in vaccinology as being those \u201ctransvaccinology\u201d or \u201cpathogen-specific\u201d in nature. Problems in transvaccinology are those applicable to the development of many vaccines\u2014these include (with examples of each) the ability of pathogens to be variable and escape immune responses (influenza virus, HIV); the host's short-lived effector memory to a vaccine or vaccine candidate (pertussis); the difficulty in both finding and inducing the correct functional response (antibody vs cell-mediated immunity) in the host (HIV, RSV); and population-specific challenges in vaccine epidemiology (variable epidemiology of rotavirus and meningococcal serotypes across the globe). Challenges that are classified as pathogen-specific include (1) the lack of identification of either useful correlates of protection (dengue, tuberculosis) or (2) the antigens required for generation of mechanistic or nonmechanistic correlates of protection (cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis, malaria). Dr. Plotkin also fondly recalled his decades-long personal and professional friendship with Dr. Hall.\n",

Dr. Thomas Evans (Aeras; formerly URMC Infectious Diseases Unit) described the pitfalls and promises of small molecule antiviral drug discovery. Dr. John McBride (Northeastern Ohio Medical University-Akron, formerly URMC Pediatric Pulmonology) summarized the physiology of RSV bronchiolitis and its relationship to asthma, and he provided some of his favorite recollections of working with Dr. Hall on the initial clinical ribavirin RSV treatment trials [\n67\u201372\n].
