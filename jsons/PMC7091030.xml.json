Zika, an arbovirus of the flaviviridae family, is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti [3]. Zika infections are almost asymptomatic in nature with most common symptoms of infection being rash, fever, and joint pain. The recent Zika outbreaks have caused alarm because of significant increase in Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome and microcephaly in newborns, which led WHO to declare it as global health emergency [3, 4, 6\u20138]. The current Zika epidemics are reported to be part of the Asian lineage of the virus, which have undergone an optimization in codon usage of NS1 gene for expression in humans [9\u201311].",

            "text": "Vaccination is considered as an effective and essential strategy for management of viral infections in the absence of a precise antiviral drug. The conventional vaccinology approach to develop new vaccines by cloning and expressing the dominant surface antigen are only effective when given with strong adjuvants [14, 15]. However, this approach is unlikely to work for pathogens that have highly mutable genome such as RNA viruses as in the case of Zika [16]. To resolve such a scenario, integration of computational tools for epitope discovery (immunoinformatics-driven approach) has achieved significant strides through genome-based subunit vaccine design [17, 18]. T-cell epitope can induce pathogen-specific immunogenic memory for a faster and stronger adaptive immune response upon infection, which is hallmark of an efficacious vaccine [16, 19]. As T-cells recognize epitopes that are derived from a broader range of proteins, whole genome can be explored for the selection of T-cell epitopes unlike surface proteins as in case of B-cell epitopes. T-cell subunit vaccines are safer, as they elicit immune responses based on the minimal pathogen-specific antigenic elements, conserved across multiple pathogenic strains and exclude self (host) antigens [16]. Indeed, T-cell epitopes have been shown as potential vaccine candidates in flaviviruses such as Dengue and Yellow fever [20\u201327]. Therefore, an immunoinformatics approach was implemented in the present study to detect minimal T-cell epitopes from the translated ssRNA (+) genome of Zika virus, capable of inducing cell-mediated immunity in humans.",

Thirty-eight immunogens were subsequently validated as MHC-I binding epitopes in NetCTL with 0.89 sensitivity and 0.94 specificity with at least one of the A2, A24, B7 and B58 MHC-I supertypes [42, 45, 46]. Fourteen of the 38 epitopes were predicted as CTL epitopes with specificity 0.993 (Table 3; Suppl. Table 7). These epitopes also revealed low percentile rank in IEDB analysis (Table 3; Suppl. Table 8). In fact, 13 of the 14 proposed CTL epitopes had average percentile rank below 5 (Table 3), which justifies high binding affinity of proposed CTL epitopes towards MHC-I alleles. Therefore, the 14 epitopes were proposed as potential CTL epitopes (Table 3).\n",

The seven T-cell epitope sharing MHC-I and MHC-II binding motif are anticipated to constitute minimal antigens to elicit both helper T-cell and CTL-mediated immunity against Zika virus. Three of the seven T-cell epitopes, C:44-66, NS3:421-453 and NS3:540-554 were 100% conserved in 100 Zika virus strains. These three epitopes may be tested as subunit vaccine either independently or together with other proposed T-cell epitopes to achieve optimum adaptive immunity in host for all strains of Zika virus. Further, the epitope, NS3:357-366 was found to be conserved in Zika, West Nile and Spondweni virus, hence, may be used for designing common subunit vaccine.",

Possibly for this reason, none of the T-cell antigens from E and NS1 protein made it to final list of proposed T helper and CTL epitopes. In case of E protein, nine peptides were predicted as immunogens through EMBOSS and VaxiJen (Suppl. Table 1); while, only two peptides showed MHC-II binding propensities (Suppl. Data 1) and four peptides showed MHC-I binding propensities (Suppl. Data 2). But none of these epitopes could pass through the threshold set at PREDIVAC and NetCTL, respectively. In the case of NS1 protein, although three peptides were predicted as immunogens through EMBOSS and VaxiJen (Suppl. Table 1), none of them showed potential as T-cell antigens in subsequent analysis. Therefore, the antigenic peptides of E and NS1 proteins may be involved in inducing B-cell-mediated humoral response as have been reported for Dengue virus [9, 54\u201356]. Our reasoning also complemented well with Khan et al.

C:44-66 is the best T-cell epitope among the 21 potential subunit vaccines.
