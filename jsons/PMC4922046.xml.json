The \u201ctransnationalization\u201d of infectious diseases across geopolitical boundaries during cholera epidemics in 1830 and 1847 in Europe, catalysed the evolution of earliest multilateral governance of communicable diseases. In 1851, France convened the first International Sanitary Conference, which laid down the basic tenet of maximum protection against international spread of infectious diseases with minimum restriction [2]. A full century lapsed before the international sanitary rules were adopted in 1951 and these were amended in 1969 to become the International Health Regulations (IHR), revised in 1973 and 1981. Three communicable diseases cholera, plague, yellow fever currently must be reported under the IHR. New diseases have been emerging at the unprecedented rate. The international response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emphasized the need to promptly report cases with the potential of international spread.",

According to IHR (2005) a public health emergency of international concern refers to an extraordinary public health event which is determined: to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.
