Morphologically, physiologically and serologically, it is different from the well-known temperate phage P22 and related phages as well as a virulent phage 9NA (Murthy, 1987). MB78 cannot multiply in minimal medium containing citrate. The chelating agent EDTA is an effective inhibitor of its DNA synthesis, whereas EGTA and orthophenanthroline have practically no effect on the development of the phage (Verma and Chakravorty, 1987). MB78 is a dominant phage in that it does not allow phages like P22 and 9NA to grow in its presence. MB78 contains a 42 kb linear, double-stranded DNA (molecular weight 28\u00d7106\n Da), which replicates through concatemer formation, subsequently converted to full-length phage DNA through \u2018headful\u2019 packaging mechanism. Like P22, MB78 DNA is circularly permuted and terminally redundant (Khan et al., 1991a, Pandey, 1992, Srinivasula, 1992).",

            "text": "It is now known that two proteins can be expressed from a single open reading frame through \u2018ribosomal frameshifting\u2019. If the ribosome shifts during translation, one base in either direction, i.e. towards 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 ends, the reading frame will be changed. During the process of \u2018ribosomal frameshifting\u2019, two or more proteins can result, starting from a single initiation codon (Farabaugh and Vimaladithan, 1998). A shift in the 3\u2032 direction (+1 frame shift) has been described in the yeast retrotransposon TY (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990), copia-like elements of Drosophila (Saigo et al., 1984) and E. coli release factor 2 (Weiss et al., 1988). Similarly, a shift in the 5\u2032 direction (\u22121 frame shift) has been demonstrated for retroviruses (Jacks et al., 1988, Vickers and Ecker, 1992), luteoviruses (Brault and Miller, 1992, Prufer et al., 1992), the bacterial transposon IS 1 (Sekine et al., 1992) and in potato leafroll virus (Kujawa et al., 1993). A \u22121 frameshifting event often controls the levels of expression of viral reverse transcriptase relative to viral core proteins in retroviruses. Frameshifting is also known to effect gene expression in coronaviruses and even in a bacterial system (Chamorro et al., 1992). In all these cases, frameshifting occurs as the ribosome passes a seven nucleotide sequence 5\u2032 XXXYYYZ 3\u2032 (X is A, U or G, Y is A or U, and Z is any nucleotide), known as the \u2018slippery site\u2019. Two of the three base pairs between the anticodons of each of the two tRNAs and mRNAs can be maintained after the slip into the \u22121 reading frame. The slippery sequence is not the only determinant of frameshifting; secondary signals are also required (Atkinson et al., 1997, Larsen et al., 1995). Secondary signals programmed in the mRNA augment shifting at the slippery sequence to give high levels of frameshifting. These signals, called \u2018stimulators\u2019, are very diverse. For example, the +1 shift for decoding RF2 (release factor) of E. coli requires two stimulators: one is a UGA terminator at codon 26 flanking the shift site on its 3\u2032 site (Weiss et al., 1988); the other is a Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence located three nucleotides upstream of the shift site (Weiss et al., 1988). These two stimulators act independently with substantial activity, but their effects are synergistic.",

            "text": "Pseudoknots, a tertiary interaction involving base pairing between two regions of unpaired bases, are also involved in frameshifting. The model for the pseudoknot structure was based on biochemical analysis of the 3\u2032 end of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RNA (Dumas et al., 1987, Pleij et al., 1985). In E. coli, ribosomal protein S4 represses its own synthesis in addition to the synthesis of other ribosomal proteins viz. S11, S13 and L17 by binding to a pseudoknot structure. The structure resembles a \u2018double pseudoknot\u2019 linking a hairpin upstream of ribosome binding site with sequences 2\u201310 codons downstream of the initiation codon (Tang and Draper, 1989). Pseudoknots also play a role in the structural mimicry of tRNA at the 3\u2032 termini of plant viral RNAs (Pleij et al., 1985). One of the most intriguing functions of the pseudoknot structure in frameshifting occurs during the translation of certain retroviral mRNAs (Atkinson et al., 1997, Jacks et al., 1988, Kujawa et al., 1993). Mutational analyses in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (Chamorro et al., 1992) and in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Brierley et al., 1992) provide strong evidence for the stimulator structural element being a pseudoknot. The autoregulation of gp32 in phage T4 also involves a pseudoknot (Shamoo et al., 1993). In this investigation, we provide evidence for the first time that one of the two late genes from bacteriophage MB78 is expressed by ribosomal frameshifting.",

The EcoRI \u2018F\u2019 fragment of MB78 codes for four proteins of mass 28, 26, 21 and 11 kDa (Fig. 1\n, lane 1).

In lane 1, four major proteins of molecular weights 28, 26, 21 and 11 kDa expressed from the cloned EcoRI \u2018F\u2019 fragment could be seen. Lanes 2\u20135 show the proteins expressed by different sequentially deleted DNAs.

The expression of 28 and 26 kDa proteins was unaffected even after the deletion of 1518 bp from the original construct (lane 3). The present study focuses on the characterization of the 28 and 26 kDa proteins.

After deletion of 1595 bp, the expression of both proteins was reduced simultaneously (lane 4), and no expression was detected after the deletion of 1723 bp (lane 5).

Computer analysis of the nucleotide sequence indicated the possibility of encoding four proteins that could be expressed from three ORFs (data not presented). The ORF for the 28 and 26 kDa proteins starts from 1641 and does not have a stop codon in the \u2018F\u2019 fragment; it appears that the vector stop codon, located adjacent to EcoRI site, might be used. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of EcoRI \u2018F\u2019 fragment revealed that expression of 28 and 26 kDa proteins may have occurred through ribosomal frameshifting. We analyzed the sequence for the formation of possible secondary structures, necessary for the process of classical ribosomal frameshifting (Fig. 3A\n). Computation also revealed the presence of a slippery sequence with a possible downstream pseudoknot structure (Fig. 3B). The slippery sequence present in bacteriophage MB78 resembles that of the turnip yellow mosaic virus (Kujawa et al., 1993).",

If they are expressed from overlapping open reading frames with the same initiation codon, truncation of the gene from the 3\u2032 end should yield only a single protein. This part of the gene has an internal HindIII restriction site, located 138 bp away from the EcoRI site, at the 3\u2032 end of the fragment. When this portion is deleted, the coding region will be reduced to 555 bp, encoding a protein of approximately 22 kDa. To test this, plasmid \u25b41518 was truncated (\u25b41518/138 H) and used to transform the minicell producing strain DS410 to observe the expression of proteins. The expression pattern of the deleted plasmid is presented in Fig. 4\n. Deletion of 138 bp from the 3\u2032 end of the EcoRI \u2018F\u2019 fragment resulted in complete abolition of 26 and 28 kDa proteins, but a major protein, smaller in size (22 kDa, marked with triangle), was expressed (lane 4). The deletion of 3\u2032 end of the gene, resulting in the synthesis of a single protein instead of two proteins, supports the frameshift notion. The presence of a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot structure downstream to the putative shift site strengthens the argument.",

Vector pET21a carries an N-terminal T7.tag sequence plus an optional C-terminal His.tag sequence, whereas pET28a has an N-terminal His.tag, T7.tag and an optional C-terminal His.tag. These vectors facilitate the purification of expressed proteins in an efficient manner by affinity purification on Ni+2-affinity resin (Clontech). Recombinant proteins with C-terminal His.tag (pET21a) and C and N-terminal His.tags (pET28a) were expressed in E. coli BL-21 DE3. Purified proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blotting was performed with T7 specific antibody. A single 28 kDa protein was present in cells expressing C-terminal His.tag in pET21a vector (Fig. 6A\n), whereas 26 and 28 kDa proteins were present in cells expressing N and C-terminal His.tags in pET28a vector (Fig. 6B). This suggests that frameshift occurs at the C-terminal region, resulting in the appearance of a truncated 26 kDa protein without a C-terminal His.tag in addition to the expression of a full-length 28 kDa protein with a C-terminal His.tag. Mutations were created (deletion of three nucleotides) near the putative slippery sequence by overlapping PCR and were cloned into pET28a. Recombinant proteins were expressed and separated as described above. We predicted that this mutation should result in the loss of frameshift. As expected the mutated recombinant constructs did not yield the 26 kDa protein, but only the 28 kDa protein (Fig. 6C, lane 1). These results further support ribosomal frameshifting.",

It has been postulated in \u22121 frameshift that an anti-Shine\u2013Dalgarno-like sequence, present at 5\u2032 to the shift site (Larsen et al., 1994), pairs with the 16S rRNA of the elongating ribosome to make the ribosome pause, resulting in a frameshift. This feature is observed mostly in prokaryotes.4.An aspect of the current study of bacteriophage MB78 is that more than 35% of the ribosomes appear to be involved in frameshifting. Reports in the literature indicate that the proteins synthesized as a result of frameshifting are much less numerous, to a maximum of 10\u201320%.5.Amino acid sequence analysis (e.g. LC/MS, MALDI-TOF) of the 28 and 26 kDa two proteins, encoded by the EcoRI \u2018F\u2019 fragment is required to confirm the ribosome frameshift hypothesis from the present study.\n",
