Classification of asthma severity was performed according to the Global Initiative for Asthma.23 Atopy was evaluated by using skin prick tests (SPTs) to a panel of 18 locally relevant allergens performed outside the pollen season. Exclusion criteria were a history of seasonal or allergen-driven symptoms, current or previous use of specific immunotherapy, use of inhaled steroids within the previous 2 months, recent (<2 months) URI, and chronic conditions potentially affecting airway responsiveness.24 All parents provided written consent, and the study was approved by the hospital's ethics committee.",

In our study, when the duration of AHR was assessed after a single infection, either in the subgroup of subjects who did not have additional infection for up to 11 weeks, or by means of a simple regression model, it was 7 weeks on average, ranging from 5 to 11 weeks. This time span is still longer than previously reported in human subjects (10 days to 6 weeks)4, 34 and comparable with time spans reported studies prospectively evaluating postviral AHR in experimental animals (2-22 weeks).8, 10, 35, 36 Nevertheless, when AHR was assessed in the long term after multiple colds, a considerable proportion of atopic subjects remained hyperresponsive for considerably longer, in some cases more than 6 months. This is consistent with the notion that additional, naturally occurring colds might further prolong AHR, as recently shown in an experimental animal setting,37 and might prove important in considering the natural history of the disease, as well as management of such patients. Therefore although our hypothesis that atopy might lead to postviral AHR prolongation was shown not to be directly true because there was no difference in AHR duration after a single infection, the total duration of AHR was in fact significantly longer in atopic than nonatopic children and that was associated with an increased number of colds, as well as asthma episodes.",

This was not completely unexpected because all our subjects were selected for a postinfectious asthma phenotype during the 2 previous years, apparently reporting symptoms only after colds and not after allergen exposure. Certainly, the possibility that unidentified allergens might have contributed to some exacerbations cannot be completely excluded. However, the fact that the identified allergens did not seem to influence the outcome, although the number of colds and subsequent asthma exacerbations during the study was higher in atopic children, suggests that an increased susceptibility to viral infection might be a more plausible mechanism for prolongation of AHR in that group. Previous evidence suggests that the immune response to rhinovirus is defective in atopic asthmatic individuals, with reduced IFN-\u03b3 production,20, 46 which might be associated with increased susceptibility to symptomatic virus infections. In fact, rhinovirus-induced IFN-\u03b3 production is strongly associated with AHR in patients with asthma.21\n",
