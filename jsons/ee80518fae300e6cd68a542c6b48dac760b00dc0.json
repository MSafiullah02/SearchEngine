            "text": "The nonstructural (NS) protein NS3/4A protease is a critical factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) maturation that requires activation by NS4A. Synthetic peptide mutants of NS4A were found to inhibit NS3 function. The bridging from peptide inhibitors to heterocyclic peptidomimetics of NS4A has not been considered in the literature and, therefore, we decided to explore this strategy for developing a new class of NS3 inhibitors. In this report, a structure-based design approach was used to convert the bound form of NS4A into 1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide derivatives as first generation peptidomimetics. This scaffold mimics the buried amino acid sequence Ile-25' to Arg-28' at the core of NS4A 21'-33' needed to activate the NS3 protease. Some of the synthesized compounds (Coded MOC) were able to compete with and displace NS4A 21'-33' for binding to NS3. For instance, N 5 -(4-guanidinobutyl)-N 2 -(n-hexyl)-1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide (MOC-24) inhibited the binding of NS4A 21'-33' with a competition half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 1.9 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b5M in a fluorescence anisotropy assay and stabilized the denaturation of NS3 by increasing the aggregation temperature (40% compared to NS4A 21'-33' ). MOC-24 also inhibited NS3 protease activity in a fluorometric assay. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to rationalize the differences in structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the active MOC-24 and the inactive MOC-26. Our data show that MOC compounds are possibly the first examples of NS4A peptidomimetics that have demonstrated promising activities against NS3 proteins.",

The pocket accommodating the Ile-25` hydrophobic side chain has been sought as an opportunity to increase the binding potency of our compounds. In the context of probing this hydrophobic pocket, we decided to synthesize compounds of different hydrophobic substituents at the C2 amide group. The imidazole's C5 carboxamide occupied the same position of the amide bond between Gly-27` and Arg-28`, conserving a hydrogen bond with Gln-8 (located within the A0 sheet). Its agmantyl substituents occupied the same position of the Arg-28` side chain. In addition, the bifurcate hydrogen bonding between the backbone carbonyl of Val-26` and NH groups of Thr-10 and Arg-11 were compensated by hydrogen bonding accepted by the N3 of the 1H-imidazole core ( Interestingly, this glycine turn is conserved in all crystal structures of HCV NS3 protease in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) deposited to date, regardless of their genotype [33] [34] [35] or of the sequence constructs used (NS4A fused with NS3 or non-fused) [14, 23, 35] (see Supplementary Material, Figure  S1A ).

The pocket accommodating the Ile-25' hydrophobic side chain has been sought as an opportunity to increase the binding potency of our compounds. In the context of probing this hydrophobic pocket, we decided to synthesize compounds of different hydrophobic substituents at the C2 amide group. The imidazole's C5 carboxamide occupied the same position of the amide bond between Gly-27' and Arg-28', conserving a hydrogen bond with Gln-8 (located within the A0 sheet). Its agmantyl substituents occupied the same position of the Arg-28' side chain. In addition, the bifurcate hydrogen bonding between the backbone carbonyl of Val-26' and NH groups of Thr-10 and Arg-11 were compensated by hydrogen bonding accepted by the N3 of the 1H-imidazole core ( Figure 2 ).

Monitoring the PL-RMSD of the NS3/MOC-24 simulation indicated that the conformational fluctuations of the NS3 protein (backbone atoms) equilibrated after ~10.0 ns and this status was maintained towards the end of the simulation period ( Figure 6 ).

(3) Water (0.6 mL/mmol) was added dropwise over a period of 2 h to a stirred mixture of ethyl cyanoformate 1 (1.0 equiv., 3 g, 30.3 mmol), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.5 equiv., 3.16 g, 45.4 mmol), and sodium carbonate (0.77 equiv., 2.470 g, 23.3 mmol) in ethanol (24.0 mL) at room temperature (rt). Upon completion, the reaction was quenched, and the solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting residue was extracted with dichloromethane, and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over MgSO 4 , filtered, and concentrated to afford a white solid of the intermediate (Z)-2-amino-2-(hydroxyimino) acetate (2) . The intermediate 2 was recrystallized from chloroform and n-heptane to afford white crystals (1.881 g, 47%), mp 59-61 \u2022 C, which were used without further purification for the next step. This intermediate (1.0 equiv., 1.320 g, 10 mmol) and tert-butyl propiolate (1.0 equiv., 1.262 g, 10 mmol) and Et 3 N (1.0 equiv., 1.40 mL, 1 mmol) were added to toluene (5.50 mL). The resulting solution was microwave-irradiated at 120 \u2022 C for 10 min at 300 W, after a heating ramp, for 3 min. The solvent was evaporated, and the final product was purified by crystallization from ethyl acetate (EtOAc)/hexane to obtain 128 mg (53. Under an inert atmosphere, carboxylic acid (1.0 equiv., 5.21 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (26 mL) then EDCI (1.0 equiv., 0.998 g, 5.21 mmol), HOBt (1.0 equiv., 0.704 mg, 5.21 mmol), diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (1.5 equiv., 1.35 mL, 7.80 mmol), and the amine R 2 NH 2 (1.2 equiv., 6.25 mmol) were added in the indicated order. The mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h then heated to 60 \u2022 C. After 3 h, EDCI (0.5 equiv., 0.500 g, 2.60 mmol), HOBt (0.5 equiv., 0.352 g, 2.60 mmol), and DIPEA (0.75 equiv., 0.677 mL, 3.90 mmol) were added to the mixture. After completion, the mixture was purified by column chromatography using gradient elution (50-100% EtOAc in cyclohexane).",

Monitoring the PL-RMSD of the NS3/MOC-24 simulation indicated that the conformational fluctuations of the NS3 protein (backbone atoms) equilibrated after~10.0 ns and this status was maintained towards the end of the simulation period (Figure 6). Meanwhile, the ligand (MOC-24) equilibrated at~13.4 ns. Both the protein and the ligand clearly showed the least fluctuations after 17.5 ns and until the simulation ended at 20 ns, indicating that the complex reached stability at this binding mode.",
