While some people are forced, usually through poverty, to live in dirty conditions, some anthropologists believe we have natural tendencies to live in a clean, orderly environment (Curtis, 2001), and there is evidence to suggest consumers avoid unclean food environments (Food Standards Agency, 2004). Clean surroundings are increasingly believed to be important in the prevention of disease transmission, and a dirty environment in the home, hospitals, workplace, etc., can aid the spread of pathogens. Recent outbreak experience with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), Ebola, strains of influenza viruses, and norovirus has refocused attention on the role of the environment in the spread of disease. For the food industry, the adequacy of cleaning may be critical in preventing cross-contamination, for a range of pathogens especially in the preparation of RTE foods (Redmond et al., 2004, Ismail et al., 2013). However, it is not just microbial pathogens or their toxins in food that can affect consumers\u2019 health, but increasingly the presence of traces of human food allergens, as a result of cross-contamination, can be a cause for concern.",

Cleaning costs money (time, labor, equipment, and consumables) and failure to clean properly can literally mean throwing money down the drain! Adequate cleaning is usually a legislative requirement and is mandated as such in the EU for all food products. The EU Regulation (EC No. 852/2004) on the hygiene of foodstuffs in Annex 11 Chapter 1 requires that \u201cfood premises should be kept clean and maintained in a good state of repair and condition\u201d and be such as to protect against the accumulation of dirt. Similar legislation requiring the cleaning of premises can also be found in most other countries. There is therefore a clear obligation in law to keep food premises clean, wherever there is a risk to food. It is usually only necessary to prove that dirt exists for an offense to be committed (Dillon and Griffith, 1999).",

This requires the effectiveness of cleaning to be assessed, the definition of acceptable and unacceptable levels of cleanliness, coupled with recording of results and the identification of trends (BRC, 2015). Although not a legal requirement, failure to achieve the standard could be of economic importance and mean considerable loss of business/revenue to a food manufacturer by excluding them from important markets.\n",

When supplied with nutrients and the correct conditions these microorganisms can multiply and/or survive in food premises and on food-contact surfaces. Organisms in a food plant can be considered as \u201ctransient\u201d (relatively easily removed by cleaning) and resident (more difficult to remove by cleaning) with the latter persisting in food plants for many years even after cleaning (Tompkin, 2002). Following attachment to a surface some bacteria can exhibit a variety of physiological and genetic responses to a range of environmental stresses, enabling them to survive in less than ideal conditions (Humphrey et al., 1995, Keer and Birch, 2003, Ismail et al., 2013). Contributory factors allowing organisms to establish in a food plant include their ability to mount a stress response and the ability to form biofilms. Biofilms (microorganisms plus associated organic matrix), can be difficult to remove with the organisms inside the biofilm having increased resistance to antimicrobial agents including biocides (Gilbert et al., 1990). Monitoring cleaning programs can therefore involve looking for the presence of microorganisms, organic residues, or both.",

Increasingly, the process is being supported by various software tools.

The main argument in favor of rinsing is the removal of cleaning chemicals and possibly reducing the chances of developing biocide resistance, but this needs to be weighed against the microbiological quality of available water (at point of use, not entry into the premises), the potential for recontamination of cleaned surfaces and the need to preserve a dry processing environment. In the United States, a number of sanitizers have approved limits for nonrinse application. If there are concerns about surface counts after cleaning, the use of these sanitizers first at higher levels, followed by rinsing, followed by their application at a no-rinse level has been suggested (Tompkin et al., 1999).",

Any correlations achieved could be described as \u201ccoincidental\u201d and for a strong correlation, the ratio between microbial ATP and food debris ATP would need to be constant. This is unlikely to occur in many food premises and sites, with the possible exception of some hand-contact surfaces (Griffith et al., 2000). It is possible to have foods with a high ATP count and low microbial count (eg, UHT milk), thus a small increase in product residue can increase the surface ATP count but not microbial numbers. Similarly, depending on the food product, for example, raw foods, and their level of microbial contamination, it is possible to have a relatively low ATP increase with higher increases in microbial numbers. More recently ATP technology has been linked to the assessment of acid phosphatase, an enzyme found in RAW meat and poultry. After swabbing a surface and reacting for 2 or 5 min (depending on sensitivity required) light is emitted\u2014the more light emitted the more acid phosphatase is present and therefore the less clean the surface. The enzyme is inactivated during cooking and surfaces used for cooked products should give low readings.",

However, most auditors will take a torch (flashlight) with them to inspect the visual cleanliness of dark/hidden, out-of-the-way places in food premises. More recently dye tests have been developed (invisible to the naked eye but visible under UV light) and are finding particular use in health care (Boyce et al., 2011). These are essentially a test of cleaning method rather than routine or random testing for surface cleanliness. Their use in the food industry could be hampered by the possibility of dye residues getting into food, causing safety or organoleptic problems, although possibly they could find use in nonfood-contact areas. The dye has to be covertly applied to surfaces prior to cleaning and cleaning can be deemed acceptable if it has been removed. Simple visual assessment can be combined with magnification/microscopy, as well as touch, dust, or powder to detect grease or other residues.\n",

High counts can be found in some fresh foods, for example, tomatoes, while other foods, especially highly processed foods such as fats, oils, or sugar, contain very low amounts. Detergents/sanitizers used in cleaning can have a similar effect to the extractants used in the tests and different studies have demonstrated that commonly used cleaning chemicals can cause either quenching or enhancement of the ATP signal. It is therefore desirable, for consistency of results, to ensure that cleaning agents are removed by rinsing before testing is performed. The repeatability and reliability of the instruments and their tests can vary considerably among manufacturers, but is generally superior to microbiological swabbing. The sensitivity of the instruments and their tests is variable and higher-sensitivity instrument/tests combinations can detect down to 0.1 fmol of ATP. There have been discussions over exactly how sensitive ATP tests need to be and although there is a demand for a certain minimum sensitivity, if a test could be too sensitive is more debatable. The key requirement is that they should be able to discriminate \u201cwell cleaned\u201d from \u201cinadequately cleaned\u201d surfaces, which are important or relevant to a business.

In some of the assays, other food nonprotein, reducing components may also bring about a color change. Some methods make use of an enhanced Buiret reaction. Under alkaline conditions the peptide bonds of proteins form a complex with the copper II (Cu2+) of the Buiret reagent, reducing it to Copper I (Cu+) ions. These react with bicinchoninic acid, producing an intense purple color. Other protein tests make use of different so-called \u201cprotein error indicator\u201d dyes (eg, tetrabromophenol blue), which change color in the presence of protein at a particular pH. These tests may be swab-based, although some versions use test strips or pads.

            "text": "Most swabbing protocols are based upon the swab-rinse technique originally developed by Manheimer and Yheunez in 1917 (Favero et al., 1968). A sterile swab, consisting of a more or less flexible shaft with a fibrous bud or tip, is premoistened in an appropriate wetting agent and inoculated by rubbing over the surface to be tested. The microorganisms transferred to the swab can then be cultivated and counted, either by inoculating the swab directly onto an appropriate solid culture medium or by releasing captured microorganisms into a known quantity of sterile recovery diluent, which is then used to prepare pour plates. This description of swabbing also indicates some of the variability in the technique (Moore and Griffith, 2007, Ismail et al., 2013, Downey et al., 2012), which can considerably affect the apparent number of organisms recovered (Moore and Griffith, 2002a, Moore and Griffith, 2007). If the number of microorganisms on a surface is known (as in laboratory conditions), and compared with the number obtained from swabbing, there is low recovery particularly at low surface population densities below 104 cells per cm2 (Holah et al., 1988). Additionally the swabbing technique lacks reliability, that is, repeatability and reproducibility are poor (Moore and Griffith, 2002a, Moore and Griffith, 2002b, Moore and Griffith, 2007, Moore et al., 2001). Various \u201cstandard\u201d methods are available, including ISO 18593:2004, although currently there is no universally accepted method of swabbing.

Overall recovery can be seen as a function of the removal of microorganisms from the test surface, their release from the swab and their subsequent ability to grow. Recovery rates can vary from 0.1% to 25% (Moore and Griffith, 2007) and will depend on the technique used but an optimum recovery rate of 10% for Dacron swabs is not uncommon. The type and number of microorganisms sampled can have a major effect on recovery (Rose et al., 2011, Downey et al., 2012) and they can become increasingly difficult to remove once they have adhered to a surface (Cunliffe et al., 1999), particularly in biofilms.

An alternative approach has led to the development of a wet or dry vacuum bacterial collection system. This may be of particular use in pathogen testing as it allows a much larger surface to be assessed without the need/use of a swab to lift/remove the organism from the surface being tested.",

A swab, after testing a surface, is returned to its accompanying culture tube containing a liquid or semisolid agar incorporating an indicator system. Microorganisms removed from the surface and retained by the swab grow and, as they multiply their growth can be detected, for example, by a color change. The results are semiquantitative in that the number of bacteria is not recorded but the time taken for the indicator to change color is a measure of the original microbial load. Unclean surfaces, depending upon the extent of microbial contamination, can test positive within 12 hours. When nonspecific media are used a general aerobic colony count is obtained, alternatively a selective or enrichment medium is used to test for the indicator organism or pathogens. Indicator systems can be based on chromogenic, fluorogenic, or bioluminogenic detection principles. In chromogenic assays the medium changes color as a consequence of microbial metabolism, and depending on the test indicates either the presence or absence of pathogen/group of organisms or the approximate degree of microbial surface contamination. Traditionally this could detect relevant organisms within as short a time as 18 hours (depending on the organism being tested for). More recently this time has been reduced by combining cultivation with a bioluminogenic test using a luminometer which can considerably reduce the detection time (Easter et al., 2012). This offers, depending on shift patterns, an opportunity for corrective action to be taken before further food production takes place. Using this approach, which correlates well with traditional counts, the time taken for detection extends from 1 hour, if the surface is heavily contaminated, to 8 hours for lightly contaminated surfaces. Such bioluminogenic tests are available for coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, and Listeria. Being able to perform a combined microbial cultivation and ATP assay extends the usefulness of luminometers beyond the conventional approach for estimating ATP in surface residues.\n",

            "text": "Sponges work on a similar principle to swabbing, in that microorganisms are removed, released, and cultivated. Recovery is by wiping a compressed sterile sponge (eg, cellulose acetate) of varying sizes over the test surface. Some have no swab shaft, and in order to avoid contamination, the sponge needs to be held using a sterile glove, usually provided with the sponge. Sponges may be premoistened or require the addition of a wetting agent. After inoculation the sponge is returned to a sterile envelope/packet and transported to a laboratory. After the addition of a suitable diluent to the envelope, usually followed by agitation/stomaching, the released organisms can be counted. Similar errors to those encountered in swabbing may occur, and there is some evidence to suggest that the sponge matrix retains even more of the recovered organisms than swabbing, resulting in lower overall recovery (Moore and Griffith, 2002b). However sponges if returned to an enrichment medium for pathogen detection offer superior sensitivity and are not affected by the microorganisms being attached to the sponge matrix. Any organisms in the sponge go on to grow and multiply and contribute to a positive result. Some sponges also offer the advantage of greater surface area: being much bigger than conventional swabs they allow larger surface areas to be tested, and may therefore be more useful in testing surfaces for pathogens. Greater pressure can also be applied than with swabs. Other variations include sponges on sticks, and in France, the use of gauze to swab surfaces. Recently research has indicated that electrostatic wipes offered a better overall performance than swabs (Lutz et al., 2013), however validation data on the effectiveness of some of these alternatives under a wide range of conditions and organisms are not widely available.",

Ideally risk assessment also requires knowledge of the number of organisms and some molecular techniques can be made quantitative, for example, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). One laboratory study (Buttner et al., 2007) compared conventional cultivation with qPCR on a range of surfaces, although only one organism was tested.

This is quick and cheap\u2014if a surface is visually dirty then there is likely to be little point in any further testing, additional notes should be made of visual moisture and surface condition/wear. However, in isolation, visual assessment is not a good indicator of surface cleanliness and, therefore, any decision about further testing needs to be considered in relation to product risk as well as the availability of other tests and the types of food soil. One or more types of rapid testing, for example, ATP, can be combined with microbiological methods to determine the effectiveness of surface cleaning and disinfection. Additionally, both microbiological and nonmicrobiological tests have value in validating the original cleaning program and investigating the reasons for any failure to clean effectively (Table 44.10\n). Rapid tests can be used after cleaning, prior to disinfection, to determine whether the surfaces are sufficiently free of soiling to enable successful disinfection. They can also help to identify areas difficult to clean or routinely poorly cleaned, thus indicating where microbiological testing is most useful. This type of integrated approach provides a better indication of cleaning efficacy, helps to provide transparency, and demonstrates a company\u2019s concern for effective cleaning. Additionally, it has the potential to save on cleaning costs by identifying what is, or is not, effective or necessary.",
