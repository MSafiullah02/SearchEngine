Here we review studies on specific age-related changes in B cell generation, activation, and maintenance as well as characteristics of B cell responses and antibody levels during ageing in relation to other cells and factors that are interwoven with B cell biological processes. In the elderly, fewer new B cells are generated, B cell responsiveness to antigens is impaired, and smaller and fewer germinal centers are formed within an immune response with participation of less potent T cells and follicular dendritic cells, leading to the production of reduced, often insufficient plasma cell numbers. Recall responses in the elderly appear to be limited by the cells' proliferative capacity. Hence, vaccine responsiveness is often insufficient and autoantibody production emerges in the elderly. In total, B cells appear to be less affected by age as compared with T cells. Recently, new concepts have been developed to counteract immunosenescence beyond active vaccination, comprising the generation of specific monoclonal antibodies for passive vaccination, immune rejuvenation by immunoablation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, and modulation of lifestyle.",

            "text": "Briefly, B cells are generated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow (BM), where they mature and become na\u00efve B cells which are released into the periphery. During their maturation in the BM, B cells rearrange their immunoglobulin genes encoding the B cell receptor and antibody molecules, thus determining the antigen specificity of an individual B cell. Gene rearrangement activity alternates with cell proliferation, so a highly diverse repertoire of B cells is generated, each carrying an individual specificity and unique B cell receptor (BCR). Na\u00efve B cells can be activated by binding an antigen through the BCR. This is followed by proliferation and differentiation into either plasmablasts, which secrete large amounts of antibody of the same specificity as the BCR, or into memory B cells, which remain in the periphery after the acute immune response has ceased. Such memory B cells can be activated by the same antigen to differentiate again into plasmablasts or memory B cells, both being of enhanced potency and responsiveness to recurrent antigen challenge. Somatic hypermutation (SHM), class switch recombination (CSR), and selection for antigen affinity are characteristics of germinal center reactions and memory B cell responses engaging T cell help, which may occur in spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Terminally differentiated antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells can persist for years or decades in one's body, with yet not fully defined contributions of self-renewal and longevity of these cells. Whereas memory B cells reside in secondary lymphoid organs and the blood, plasma cells reside in the BM [1, 2] . For almost all of these B cell differentiation stages, properties, and functions, age-related changes are detectable, being mainly associated with reduced immune function and protection. As, e.g., T cells are apparently more greatly affected by age than B cells [3] , some works have directly or indirectly questioned the inherent senescence of B cells [4] [5] [6] [7] , and the contributions of inherent and extrinsic factors to senescent B cell responses remain to be elucidated [8, 9] . It is generally discussed whether age-related immune phenomena reflect or cause the reaching of great age or whether immunosenescence is a process of remodeling the immune system or an indication of immunodeficiency [9, 10] . In this regard, healthy centenarians often show a different pattern of changes as compared with the 70-85-year-old population with a considerable impact of frailty.",

Tenfold to 20-fold higher frequencies of clonable progenitor B-cells (pro-B cells) and precursor B cells (pre-B cells) were detected in mice shortly after birth as compared with mice aged 6 A crucial step in initial B cell development is the expression of recombinases that allow V(D)J recombination in pro-B cells, allowing them to become pre-B cells: recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 proteins [1] . RAG-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in total BM reflecting active early B cell differentiation increase from birth until 2 months of age, remains detectable at 5months and and is severly reduced at the latest by 10 months [46] . Indeed, the BM of old mice contained comparable numbers of pro-B cells, but fewer than the half the number of pre-B cells as compared with young mice after cyclophosphamide-induced lymphopenia. In the same model, in old mice splenic B cells representative of peripheral B cells were present at one third of the numbers of those in young mice and comparatively had a restricted repertoire [31] .",

Both D to J and V to DJ recombination were diminished in old mice at the stages of early and late pro-B cells, so defective pre-BCR expression was suggested to contribute to pre-B cells apoptosis [54] . Indeed, surrogate light chain expression was decreased in pre-B cells of senescent mice [55] and was associated with decreased E2A expression [56]. When B cells expressing IgH and IgL transgenes were introduced, which do not need to undergo rearrangement, the numbers of transgenic B cells were normal, whereas endogenous B cell numbers with natural rearrangement of IgL and IgH genes were reduced in aged mice [51] .",

Consistently, functional B cells could be recovered more than 10 months after their transfer to scid mice, and can be utilized in antibody responses [82] . The half-life of peripheral mature B cells from old mice is increased (decreased turnover) and reduced levels of newly generated B cells are detected in the periphery as demonstrated using in vivo 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling experiments. In old mice, the numbers of immature splenic B cells were found to be reduced fourfold, with a concurrent reduction of the numbers of BM surface IgD \u00c0 /surface IgM int/high B cells, but not least mature surface IgD \u00c0 /surface IgM very low B cells [83] . After 4 weeks of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling, 15% of mature and transitional B cells were newly made in old mice compared with 30% in young mice. Immature B cell production rates did not differ between old and young mice in this study, so defective replenishment of peripheral compartments rather than impaired B lymphopoiesis was reasoned to be responsible for reduced peripheral counts of immature B cells in aged mice [84] . In summary, the mature peripheral B cell compartment semms to stably persist in ageing mice, and this has been shown to be independent of age [85, 86] .",

            "text": "Memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells constitute the immunological B cell memory. For both, long-tem persistence in the absence of antigens has been demonstrated [89] [90] [91] and directly challenged for memory B cells [92] or questioned as a means to provide humoral memory for plasma cells [93, 94] . There is accumulating evidence for a distinct regulation of the memory B cell compartment and humoral memory provided by plasma cells [36, 37, [95] [96] [97] [98] , as reflected by persistent antibody production in the absence of memory B cells. They are maintained in the body at different sites and by distinct mechanisms. Memory B cells reside in lymphoid tissues such as spleen [96] , tonsils [99] , lymph nodes, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, and the blood [1] and depend on the presence of the spleen [100] , reflected by their gradual disappearance from peripheral blood after splenectomy in humans [95] and concurrent increased susceptibility to microbial infections. Low frequencies of circulating memory B cells proliferate, allowing the maintenance of the whole population [88] and single specificities. By contrast, most mature plasma cells reside mainly in the BM [101, 102] , where they can survive and secrete antibody potentially for decades in old mice and humans [91, 97, 103] , reflected by persistent antigen-specific antibody titers in human blood serum of adults aged 20-65 years [104] . Long-lived plasma cells are maintained by a yet incompletely explored, hence hypothetical, survival niche which comprises, e. g., stromal cells and their products, such as IL-6 and CXCL12, as well as extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin or hyaluronans [105] [106] [107] [108] . The BM microenvironment becomes less potent to support B cell development with age [31] and senescent stromal cells exhibit limited survival and functionality [61] , which might implicate a role of the senescent BM microenvironment in reduced plasmablast recruitment and plasma cell survival [109] , similarly as shown in 1week-old mice not yet having adult immune capabilities [110, 111] . At very young age, BM stromal cells largely fail to support plasma cell survival and persistent antibody memory [110, 111] . Thereafter, from 6 to 14 weeks of age, approximately 20% of plasma cells may become long-lived, as demonstrated in lupus-prone New Zealand Black/New Zealand White mice (Hoyer, BF, Voigt, C, Mumtaz, IM, Panne, D. Moser KV, Eilat D, Manz RA, RadbruchA , Hiepe F, manuscript submitted), allowing for filling of survival niches and development of a respective antibody repertoire and increase of blood serum immunoglobulin concentrations to adult plateau values. Plasma cells settling in such niches early in life apparently provide very persistent antibody levels, as illustrated by autoantibodies which arise in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) approximately 10 years before manifestation/diagnosis of the disease (e.g., anti-Ro, anti-La) [112] are especially hard to eradicate by therapy [37] . In adulthood, serum immunoglobulin levels remain overall constant and plasma cell niches are saturated. Consistently, only approximately splenic 3% of plasma cells formed within 2 months may become long-lived in old mice as compared with 20% in young mice within the same time period (Hoyer, Voigt, Radbruch, Hiepe et al., unpublished results). Hence, newly generated plasma cells induced within new, systemic immune responses compete with resident plasma cells for habitat. Newly acquired, long-lasting humoral immunity thus reflects successful competition and is accompanied by the stoichiometric loss of resident, polyclonal plasma cells [97, 113, 114] . In this regard, competition and subsequent mobilization of resident plasma cells might contribute to the slow decrease of antigen-specific titers for some antigens [104] (see later). Other, mutually nonexclusive mechanisms to maintain antigen-specific antibody titers may exist, i.e., homeostatic proliferation of mature plasma cells and continuous de novo generation of plasma cells from memory B cells activated in a bystander mode [94] or by a persistent antigen [93, 115] . More than 95% of BM plasma cells in adult humans do not perform cell division in terms of Ki-67 expression [114] . Therefore, homeostatic proliferation as a means to maintain the plasma cell population over the long term until old age cannot be excluded. Given that homeostatic plasma cell proliferation exists, again changes of the BM microenvironment might impact on antibody titers as a function of age. For the continuous generation of plasma cells from memory B cells, ageing could impact on the B cells' ability to be activated and to proliferate, as discussed in other sections of this chapter.",

For example, analyses performed with total white blood cells do not allow consideration of the contributions of memory versus na\u00efve versus transitional B cells to total blood B cells that have been analyzed, thus introducing considerable bias. Hence, inconsistent observations have been made, including increase, reduction, and stability of the repertoire. An age-related decreased repertoire diversity of Ig V H complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 of circulating B cells was described, characterized by clonal B cell expansions in vivo in individuals over 86 years of age [126] and splenic B cells of aged mice [127, 128] , reflecting a restricted BCR repertoire showing that a smaller, restricted number of sequences give rise to B cell clones in aged individuals [129] . The loss of diversity correlated with a poorer health status and prospective mortality [126] . Peripheral blood CD19 + B cell V H family utilization was biased towards expression of V H 4-34, V H 3-23, V H 1-69, V H 4-59, and V H 1-2 in elderly individuals, whereas V H 3-9 was found solely in young individuals and V H 3-7 was only expressed in the elderly [130] . Tonsillar B cells of the V H 4 family did not show age-dependent changes in repertoire diversity [125] , as did the circulating B cell repertoire of adult individuals who were analyzed twice, 9 years apart. In four out of five donors, no apparent changes in the V H family distribution were detected [131] . Human splenic germinal center accumulate antigen-selected B cells during ageing, as reflected by a higher mutational frequency and R/S ratio detected within CDR. The opposite effects were observed when analyzing germinal center B cells from young versus old Peyer's patches [132] .",

When the same analyses were performed in 2-year-old mice, only little further impairment was observed [137] . The age-related impairment of secretory antibody responses was demonstrated further in senescent rats that showed reduced IgA + plasma cell numbers in the intestinal lamina propria. Concurrently, IgA + B cells in Peyer's patches accumulated to double the numbers of those in young animals, and fewer a 4 b 7 integrin + IgA + plasmablasts were detected in blood circulation. Old rats additionally showed diminished density of blood-vessel-expressing mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (the ligand of a 4 b 7 integrin) in the lamina propria, so impaired IgA + plasmablast migration was concluded as an effect of immunosenescence [138] .",

In old mice as compared with young mice, fewer NP-specific IgG + plasma cells were generated in the spleen after immunization with NP-chicken g-globulin, and their numbers dropped to lower levels during the maintenance phase [170] . During the primary response in old mice, plasma cells failed to establish as efficiently in the BM as they did in young mice. Upon booster immunization, old mice also generated fewer plasma cells in the spleen and BM than young mice, but with significant increase in antibody-secreting cell numbers as compared with the primary response. Specific serum titers were also generated at tenfold lower levels in aged mice, and remained impaired also in a secondary vaccination with tenfold or greater reduction in old mice as compared with young mice. When V H 186-2 + B cells indicative of antigen-specific B cells were analyzed, reduced accumulation of somatic mutations in aged mice was observed and old mice failed to select plasma cells with higher mutations into the BM [170] . Consistently, the spleen of aged mice harbors more antigen-specific low-affinity IgM + plasma cells and fewer class-switched plasma cells. The BM contained decreased numbers of high-and low-affinity plasma cells in old mice as compared with young mice. Reconstituting old mice with splenocytes from young mice led to restoration of a young plasma cell response pattern in the spleen, but not the BM, reflecting the reduced capacity of the BM to recruit and maintain plasma cells [144] . Aged mice produced less frequently splenic foci containing specific B cells, and within these, fewer specific B cells (less than 50%) were observed after immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-phosphorylcholine (PC), reflecting operational but diminished antigen-specific B cell responses in old animals [171] . Old mice utilize atypical Ig genes in their plasma cells generated in immune responses to PC, Streptococcus pneumoniae R36a vaccine, and trinitrophenol [172] [173] [174] . Such antibodies appear to be less protective, as demonstrated by loss of immune protection to pneumococcal infection of mice into which a PC-specific antibody generated in old mice was injected [173] . In contrast to results from vaccinations with haptens, the B cell response to influenza virus vaccination does not show an age-related decline in terms of specific B cell generation and repertoire diversity [175] .",

Whereas for replicating antigens, i.e., viral specificities, antibody titer half-lives were virtually unchanged with age, those for protein antigens (tetanus and diphtheria toxoid) declined slowly with a half-life of more than 10 years, despite regular booster immunizations [104] . In line with these findings, anti-RSV IgG titers were undiminished in individuals at 70-80 years of age as compared with young controls at approximately 35 years of age, independent of frailty, whereas among US citizens older than 70 years, fewer than 30% had protective tetanus-specific IgG titers [190] . These specificity-related differences might arise from the different nature of the antigen and respective heterogeneity of immune activation in terms of timing, duration, antigen affinity, localization of the immune response, and replicating, sometimes persistent antigen acquired by natural infection versus nonreplicating, degradable antigen often applied by artificial challenge, i.e., vaccination.",

A similar phenomenon has been described in mice [198] [199] [200] . Among centenarians, no further increase but a strong reduction of the prevalence of autoantibody-positive individuals was observed, e.g., for antithyroglobulin and antigastric parietal cell antibodies (PCA) antibodies, but not for RF [118, 201] . Differences have been noted between organ-specific and nonspecific autoantibodies with regard to their relation to the frailty of tested individuals. A screening of 148 European individuals at the age of 100 years revealed almost 80% of them expressed at least one autoantibody of 15 organ-specific and nonspecific autoantibodies tested, with the highest prevalence of IgM RF (26.6%). Autoantibodies did not reflect autoimmune disease, but organ-specific in contrast to nonspecific autoantibodies were rarely detected in individuals without comorbidities or disabilities. At least one organ-specific antibody was detected in 32% of the same cohort [118, 202] , confirming the findings of earlier studies [181, 203] . Old individuals also display an increased usage of V H 4 gene family members, which are enriched for rearrangements potentially leading to autoreactive antibodies [204] , especially V H 4-34, which has been found associated with cold agglutinin disease [130] .",

Nevertheless autoantibodies can be detected 7-9 years before the onset of SLE, leaving it open to question whether the autoantibody-positive elderly are in the stage of \"benign autoimmunity\" preceding overt disease [112] . Autoantibodies may arise as by-products of vaccine responses in mice [207] and humans [208, 209] . Transiently increased RF production was observed after tetanus and influenza booster vaccinations of normal healthy individuals [208, 209] . The relative increase in the underlying IgG reactive IgM + B cell population correlated with the amounts of tetanus toxoid specific IgG measured in blood serum [208] and was more profound than the vaccination induced IgM-RF production measured in the blood serum. A role for CD5 + B cells within autoantibody production appears to be implicated as peritoneal cavity CD5 + B1 cells have been shown to be a source of IgM RF [210] . The development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which occurs at rather old age, often shows a CD5 + phenotype [204] . However, the numbers of CD5 + B cells become reduced with age in peripheral blood [118, 124] .",

In addition, combined parenteral and mucosal (nasal) vaccination [214] provides additional protection in the elderly [215] . Apart from vaccinations, increasing efforts are being made to generate recombinant monoclonal antibodies from antigen-specific B cells isolated ex vivo from immune donors to neutralize pathogens without previous vaccination, thus circumventing age-related and other limitations in vaccine development and responsiveness. Clearance of antibody-bound pathogens further depends critically on the complement system and macrophages, which are also affected by age. Various techniques have been used to generate such neutralizing antibodies specific for influenza [216, 217] HIV [218] , SARS coronavirus [219] , and RSV [220] .",

Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is currently used to treat severe autoimmunity [221, 222] and lymphoma and indeed leads to strong clinical improvement in SLE and multiple sclerosis [221, 223] . Besides reactivation of thymic activity [221, 223] , treatment leads to eradication of peripheral blood B cells and subsequent establishment of a circulating B cell population that mostly (approximately 90%) consists of na\u00efve B cells at 1-5 years after ASCT. Beside proteasome inhibition, e.g. using Bortezomib, immunoablation with rabbit antithymocyte globulin plus ASCT is also the only known treatment to eradicate plasma cells and consequently specific antibody and autoantibody production. Immunoablation/ASCT treatment targets both the pathogenic and protective immune cells and thus patients carry a high risk of suffering from sometimes fatal infections.",

Salivary secretory IgA levels are significantly increased after 1 h of choir singing [227] and are further influenced by emotional state [228] and mental exercise [229] . The impact of nutrition and drug consumption has been described [230] , but not always confirmed [231] . Caloric restriction is associated with longer life span in mouse models [232] . Hence, lifestyle factors, such as nutrition (e.g., vitamins [233, 234] ), diet, and physical and mental activity, could represent ways to counteract immunosenescence apart from medical interventions [235] .

Whether these agerelated changes are due to an intrinsic defect of HSC [40] or originate from an aged microenvironment of B lymphopoiesis [41] or result from thymic involution is a matter of discussion. Aged long-term reconstituting HSC display a reduced B cell generative capacity as compared with new, young HSC. This limitation is reflected by alterations of specificities in the B cell repertoire [42] that might be caused by age-related changes in HSC properties [43]. Potential B cell intrinsic defects comprise the reduced ability to process survival signals [44] and reduced mitotic activity in old versus young animals [45].",
