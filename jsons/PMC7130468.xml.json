PDVAC's remit is to consider how to accelerate vaccine candidates at the Phase 2 stage of clinical evaluation or earlier, for disease areas where there is substantial disease burden in low and middle income countries (LMICs), but where no vaccines currently exist, and where there is some ongoing product development activity which may benefit from guidance from WHO [2]. One of the potential key outputs from PDVAC review is the recommendation to generate a WHO guidance document describing the preferred product characteristics (PPCs) for a vaccine against a particular pathogen. These PPC documents describe WHO preferences for vaccines to be used in LMICs; in particular its indications, target groups and features of desirable clinical data related to safety and efficacy. They are intended to provide early guidance to developers at least 5\u201310 years from vaccine approval, and to ensure that, once licensed, data are available to enable decision-making on use of the vaccine in the populations that need it most.",

For this reason, the 2015 agenda included an overview of the unprecedented process and timeline to interim efficacy data for Ebola vaccines, reports from the ongoing Phase III study, as well as a Target Product Profile that is now finalised and publically available [3]. In addition, the committee was informed of efforts to establish a WHO Blueprint for Emergency R&D Preparedness and Research Response. Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was reviewed as an ongoing case study of an emerging pathogen, under the auspices of this recently formed initiative.",

In addition, recent preliminary data in the elderly demonstrated efficacy, and a phase III trial has been initiated in that target population (NCT02608502). GSK and J&J also have RSV F vaccines in clinical development that target pregnant women, and MedImmune is developing an RSV F vaccine for use in the elderly. A number of groups have RSV F vaccines in preclinical development, including NIAID. An RSV subunit vaccine containing the SH protein (Immunovax) is also currently being evaluated in adults. A number of live vaccines are in clinical development for active immunisation of infants and young children, including native RSV candidates from which nonessential genes have been deleted, and an adenovirus vector containing the RSV F gene. Passive prophylaxis with a long-half life monoclonal antibody developed by Medimmune is currently being evaluated in a dose-escalation/pharmacokinetics trial in healthy preterm infants (NCT02290340).",

High levels of maternal anti-capsular polysaccharide (CPS) IgG correlate with reduced neonatal disease risk, and a vaccine against 5 of the 10 circulating serotypes may protect against up to 90% of disease. Two large pharmaceutical companies are currently engaged in GBS vaccine development, with Glaxo SmithKline considering Phase III study designs for their candidate. The proposed approach is to identify specific anti-CPS IgG thresholds as clinical correlates of protection, based on estimation of disease risk reduction, rather than conventional clinical disease end-points. With this in mind, PDVAC recommended that WHO develop guidance on the testing and development pathway for GBS vaccines, including consensus on strategic goals, clinical trial design considerations and development of PPCs. Key development considerations include ethical issues in conducting a vaccine efficacy study in a population with high GBS incidence, such as parts of Africa, where IAP is not the standard of care.",

Molecular reanalysis of randomly selected samples collected in the study, using qPCR rather than culture, confirmed that ETEC and Shigella are two of the most significant pathogens that cause moderate-to-severe diarrhoea among children <5 years old in Africa and South Asia, accounting for around 40% of diarrhoea episodes in 12\u201323 month olds.

Several Shigella vaccine candidates, based on live attenuated or sub-unit approaches, are also in clinical studies. Trials of these vaccines are facing similar challenges to those for ETEC with respect to requiring multi-valent approaches, assay standardisation and identifying correlates of protection, as well as in defining appropriate clinical trial end-points and clinical trial design for field trials in endemic areas. In addition, it is uncertain whether a stand-alone ETEC or Shigella vaccine would be implemented, or whether developers should prioritise development of a combination ETEC/Shigella vaccine.

This vaccine is entering Phase IIb clinical studies in adults and paediatrics imminently. This bivalent candidate vaccine is based on a combination of GI.1 and GII.4 VLPs and is designed to offer cross-protection against the 25 human genotypes. However, ongoing and expanded surveillance is needed to monitor circulating strain replacement and to ensure that the candidate is able to protect against any emerging genotypes, as well as to better document the disease burden.

It is acknowledged that these reduction targets are not achievable without the development of novel tools for TB control. With the failure of the MVA-85A TB vaccine to show efficacy, the TB vaccine community has re-focused on early stage, translational research and experimental medicine studies to evaluate a more diverse candidate portfolio with respect to both antigens and delivery platforms. To accelerate evaluation and to reduce costs, novel clinical study designs are being used to collect clinical proof of concept data in targeted, high incidence populations. Recent modelling data indicates that targeting vaccines to adolescents and adults may have the highest and earliest public health impact and cost-effectiveness, and consensus is emerging that development of vaccines to prevent pulmonary tuberculosis in this age population should be a significant focus. PDVAC noted the complexities from the policy perspective with \u201cimproved BCG vaccines\u201d, including issues related to non-specific beneficial effects ascribed to BCG vaccination.
