For instance, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is now known to be related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the majority of cases. In addition, circumstantial evidence suggests that even vasculitides still classified as primary might be caused or triggered, at least in some cases, by environmental agents.",

Direct endothelial invasion and damage is probably the main mechanism operating in rickettsial infection.2 However, in the majority of cases, vasculitis is mainly the result of the immune response triggered by the offending agent. A humoral immune response with immune complex formation and deposition in and around vessel walls is thought to be primary mechanism in leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Molecular mimicry might lead to autoantibody production but also to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes.3 A cell-mediated immune response with or without granulomata formation is a recognized feature of some large-vessel vasculitides, although a link with infectious agents remains debated. Less common mechanisms postulated to underpin vasculitis are infection-triggered immune dysregulation and anti-idiotypic response.4\n",

In humans, CP infection has been linked to GCA (giant cell arteritis), which in a minority of cases is characterized histologically by adventitial periarteritis7 in the absence of the more typical transmural infiltrate.

Clinical manifestations resolved within 4 weeks, whereas the animals treated with high-dose CMV were killed 10 days after the infection for ethical reasons.

Presti et al13 infected wild-type mice and mice lacking the interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212) intraperitoneally with murine CMV. Both strains developed aortic adventitial and, to a lesser extent, intima inflammation characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration. Arteritis was associated with CMV antigen in the aortic media. However, whereas in wild-type animals lesions resolved by day 84 postinfection, IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice had significant arteritis as late as 154 days postinfection. The main points of this study are: first, that CMV can cause aortitis; and, second, that IFN-\u03b3 is crucial in curbing vascular inflammation. The importance of IFN-\u03b3 in regulating the response against CMV is further borne out by an in-vitro explant reactivation model by the same authors, which demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 could reversibly inhibit CMV reactivation from latency. As a further case in point, IFN-\u03b3 has also been shown to control vascular inflammation in a model of gamma herpesvirus-68-induced large-vessel vasculitis.14 Another cytokine that has been shown to downregulate the development of gamma herpesvirus-68-induced vasculitis is interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.15\n",

Four weeks later, a second inoculation was performed. The mice inoculated with HSV manifested changes as early as 3 days after the first inoculation. Common signs were facial hair loss, erythema, and skin ulcerations on the scratched earlobe, and eye disease including uveitis. Some mice with relatively severe manifestations but also mice without overt clinical signs showed poor general condition and died.

To dissect the mechanisms underlying HIV-associated vasculopathy, Tinkle et al developed a model of transgenic mice carrying a replication-defective HIV-1 provirus with selective deletion of the gag, pol, and env genes.18 The majority of transgenic mice developed an extensive vasculopathy in vessels of different size. Vessel histology revealed intima hyperplasia, most likely due to the migration of smooth muscle cells from the media, hypocellularity in the medial layer, and a predominantly adventitial infiltrate consisting primarily of T cells and occasionally of plasma cells and monocytes; endothelial cells were apparently unaffected. The intimal thickening generated significant luminal narrowing in some vessels, with the restricted blood flow leading to ischemia in the involved tissues. The expression of HIV nonstructural genes appeared to be confined to smooth muscle cells, in keeping with the abnormal proliferation of this cell type. Of interest, proliferation of smooth muscle cells occurred in some animals in the absence of detectable inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting that the smooth muscle cell was the primary target of HIV, whereas the adventitial immune-mediated response probably represented a secondary event. These findings are intriguing. However, this model does not reliably reproduce the characteristics of human HIV-associated vasculopathy. In fact, endothelial cells have been demonstrated to be often affected in HIV-infected individuals19, whereas the broad spectrum of HIV vasculitis seems to involve a multiplicity of mechanisms, the mutual interactions of which are still to be fully unraveled.20\n",

            "text": "With the advent of the AIDS epidemic, various types of vasculopathies have increasingly been described in HIV-infected patients. Opportunistic infections, mainly due to CMV or M. tuberculosis, have been reported, mainly in immunodeficient patients.38 As the route of transmission of HIV is also shared by HBV and HCV, it is not surprising that such viruses have been implicated as causative agents in some cases, even in immunocompetent hosts.*20, 38 Drug-induced vasculitis is also not infrequent.20 In many cases, however, HIV seems to directly induce vasculopathies of different types. A retrospective review of 148 symptomatic HIV-infected patients referred for muscle, nerve, or skin biopsy documented the presence of vasculitis in 34 (23%) patients.20 Various vasculitic types were recognized, including necrotizing arteritis (3 patients), non-necrotizing arteritis (1 patient), neutrophilic vasculitis (7 patients), mononuclear vasculitis (17 patients), and other small-vessel inflammatory changes (6 patients). According to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, 11 patients could be classified as having a distinct category of vasculitis, including PAN (4 patients), Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (1 patient), and drug-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis (6 patients), whereas 23 were classified as having unspecified vasculitis. These vasculitides were seen at different stages of HIV infection. One patient had HBV surface antigenemia, two had cryoglobulinemia, and two were co-infected by human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). CMV inclusions and antigens were detected in endothelial cells in one patient. HIV antigens and genome were detected in perivascular cells of two of the three patients with necrotizing arteritis. Immune deposits were found in small-vessel walls in five skin biopsy samples showing small vessel vasculitis and in the muscle of the three patients with necrotizing arteritis. These data indicate that a wide range of inflammatory vascular diseases can occur in HIV-infected individuals. The high (23%) frequency of vasculitis in this cohort of HIV patients is probably an overestimation related to a referral bias, as it is likely that only patients with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of vasculitis underwent a biopsy. A more realistic estimate of the true prevalence of vasculitis in HIV-infected individuals is in the range of 1% or less.23, 39\n",

Along the same lines, HIV-PAN has been reported to respond well to moderate (approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day) doses of prednisone.40\n",

Arteries affected included the common carotid, abdominal aorta, common iliac, femoral, and popliteal. No patient had any obvious infective vascular lesion, although one patient had a positive TPHA (Treponema Pallidum Hemagglutination Test) test for syphilis, whereas culture of blood and thrombus contents in another patient was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Histology showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the vasa vasora and periadventitial vessels, proliferation of slit-like vascular channels, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis. There was associated medial fibrosis with loss and fragmentation of muscle and elastic tissue. Intimal changes consisted of duplication and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina with calcification. Based on these findings, the authors argued for an infective or immune-complex origin, resulting in leukocytoclastic vasculitis of vasa vasora and periadventitial vessels. An intriguing finding reported in this study is the presence of slit-like vascular channels. Such lesions have not been observed in HIV-negative individuals and their appearance have in fact coincided with the HIV epidemic. Whether these lesions represent an early stage of Kaposi's sarcoma is not known. Angiogenic factors have been postulated to play a role, although its precise pathogenesis remains unclear.",

Theoretically, persistent vasculitis could be due to the host's inability to eradicate the infection or to switch off the immune response triggered by the infective agent after this has been cleared. Reports of resolution of virus-related vasculitis after virus eradication has been achieved would appear to support the first hypothesis.36 However, limited data mainly from animal and in-vitro studies suggest that micro-organisms might also induce vasculitis via a \u2018hit and run\u2019 mechanism.90 Furthermore, after a viral infection the immune response has been shown to interact with91, and prevent the infectious agent from becoming reactivated92 without fully eradicating it or provoking vasculitis or other organ damage. IFN-\u03b3 appears to be crucially involved in blocking viral reactivation.92\n",
