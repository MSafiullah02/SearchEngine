The wide variations observed in this 25 pandemic are a reflection of different societies with 26 different cultural backgrounds and political leaders, which 27 makes it difficult to act in a coordinated way during a 28 pandemic [4]. 29 It is interesting to document how individual countries 30 deal with a pandemic: to learn from each other and 31 eventually improve our national health care systems or 32 strive to establish a common structure. Many specialties 33 (intensive care, pneumology, virology, infectious diseases, 34 geriatrics) are focusing on saving as many infected patients 35 as possible or keeping patients as comfortable as possible.",

            "text": "Urology is a specialty that deals with both urgent and 43 non-urgent cases. It did not take long before urologists44 published guidance on which types of surgery for adult 45 patients need to be prioritised [5]. However, compared to 46 adult urology, paediatric urology has wide variations in 47 practice and involves paediatric urologists and paediatric 48 surgeons, with large disparities worldwide. Moreover, 49 prioritisation may be more difficult: while there is no 50 doubt that a child with sepsis due to an obstructing stone 51 requires urinary drainage or a testicular torsion needs 52 exploration, oncology is an infrequent problem compared to 53 adult urology. Most paediatric urology surgeries involve 54 congenital anomalies, with indications focused as much on 55 preventing morbidity (urinary tract infections [UTIs]) as on 56 a long-term perspective of preventing renal function loss 57 and assuring normal genital cosmesis and function. One 58 might wonder how urgent surgery is for a congenital 59 malformation. Life-threatening malformations, such as in 60 the heart or lung, are considered urgent without any doubt, 61 but how urgent is repair of hypospadias or bladder 62 exstrophy? As we have to expect major limitations in 63 access to surgical capacity over the coming months, the 64 variety of surgical indications that need to be considered for 65 prioritisation includes obstructive uropathy and recurrent 66 febrile UTIs putting children at intermediate-term risk of 67 loss of renal function. However, it is nearly impossible to 68 translate these issues to a definitive recommendation of 69 how long such interventions could be postponed, as the 70 dynamics of renal function loss depend on many variables 71 that are mostly impossible to predict [6]. It is likely that a 72 timeframe of 6-12 wk might be relevant for severe 73 obstruction, but for UTI-associated renal function loss such 74 a timeframe is harder to quantify. 75 Paediatric urology guidelines are based on expert 76 opinions and these have shifted over time. this article in press as: A.-F.
