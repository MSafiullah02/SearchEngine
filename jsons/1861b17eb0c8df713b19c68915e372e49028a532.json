This medical process is applied to both inpatients and outpatients. When young patients come to hospitals for mental health services, they and their parents are required to provide information on signs of infection. The most basic and important step is taking body temperature. If temperature surpasses 37.3 \u00b0C, children and their parents are tested for COVID-19 infection. All newly admitted inpatients receive regular hospital treatments in the isolation ward for at least 14 days. They are then transferred to normal wards to continue their treatments. They are not allowed to be visited by their parents during the entire inpatient treatment; online contacts are recommended. Medical employees working in the isolation ward wear masks, gowns, goggles and gloves, while they only wear masks in the normal wards. Some of these ",

With the popularization of internet services and smartphones, as well as the emergence of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, mental health professionals and health authorities have been in a position to provide online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. To date, several types of online mental health services have been implemented widely for those in need during the outbreak in China [7] . Take Beijing Children's Hospital, for example, which has initiated online medical services including the mental health services by an app in smartphones. Importantly, the staff of a hospital in Wuhan has provided online mental health counseling services for 2144 affected children in Wuhan from February 20 to March 5. Forty-five percent of these patients reported anxiety, 22% insomnia, 13% symptoms of depression, and 13% somatic complaints. 8% reported other problems. Online services might be the most suitable method to provide mental health care for children affected by COVID-19 [7] . It should be noted that online services for child and adolescent mental disorders had existed to a minimum extent only prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, based on our survey, over 15% of the 33 hospitals newly opened the online services for children and adolescents with mental disorders.",

It is the official policy in China to hospitalize all children/adolescents infected with COVID-19; the same applies to infected adults. When children are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, they are transferred to designated pediatric hospitals, and if their parents, as is usually the case, are also infected with COVID-19, these, too, will be transferred to designated hospitals for adults. Moreover, close contacts (including non-infected parents) will also be transferred to quarantine centers and stay there for at least 14 days. Therefore, the infected children necessarily face separation from their parents to stay in an isolation ward; they do not have contact with other infected children in the same ward. The hospitalization is mandatory to enable medical supervision and to prevent the spread of the virus. Wuhan Children's Hospital is the largest hospital to admit children infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. One of the team experts from this hospital reported that, based on his clinical observations, the most common mental problems of infected children were separation anxiety and insomnia.",

First, child psychiatrists might be the perfect candidates to provide mental health care to these children. Due to the lack of child and adolescent psychiatrists in China, the online work model is suggested. But for the infected children who showed signs signaling mental problems ( Table 2 ) [10] , child psychiatrists can work directly with the young patients and their families using adequate protection. Second, the provision of mental health care should last until the child recovers from COVID-19. Importantly, it has been reported that more than 10% of children who have experienced trauma due to the infection and its consequences might be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [11] . Thus, screening for PTSD may be necessary for some child patients who showed nightmares or unwanted memories of the trauma, avoidance of situations that bring back memories of the trauma, heightened reactions and so on. The content of the mental health regimen should include assessment, building of a therapeutic alliance, ranking infected children by the severity of mental and COVID-19 symptoms, formulating and enacting individual psychological plans, and providing crisis invention and any appropriate medication.",

From a mental health perspective, there are three possible reasons for this phenomenon. First, the public health crisis can raise anxiety levels in both parents and children. Second, many Chinese parents tend to overlook or are unaware of their children's mental health status. For example, due to the lack of knowledge about children's mental health, many parents have problems differentiating normal and abnormal behavioral and emotional problems in their children. Third, parenting style plays a critical role in children's mental health [16] , and a large proportion of Chinese parents use the authoritative style, which does not focus on cultivating skills to cope with this type of crisis for children. Overall, the parent-child relationship has shown a close association with the mental health of children. With the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, this relationship is facing further challenges.",

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) [19] and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [20] were used to assess the anxiety and depression symptoms. A total of 892 medical workers completed the online questionnaire between March 20 and April 1, most being under the age of 40 (75%), with a bachelor's degree (61%) and married (73%). Among them, 39% had anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score > 4), and 33% had depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score > 4) during the COVID-19 outbreak. These results indicate that we need to pay more attention to psychological assistance for medical staff. Protecting the mental health of these medical workers is also very important not only for the control of the epidemic but also for their long-term health.",

However, the COVID-19 outbreak has brought new challenges that must be addressed. Importantly, there were no national guidelines covering interventions for major public health crises affecting children. Building a national service network system might be a suitable goal for the future. This network should include governmental agencies, public health institutions, hospitals, schools, community centers, and individual families. The government would formulate the policy, public health professionals would design the details of the programs, hospitals would provide services for some serious cases, and community centers and families would take charge of less seriously affected cases and the long-term follow-up mental health care. Through such a service network, crisis invention services could be provided rapidly and thoroughly during public health crises. The scarcity of child psychiatrists in China is an urgent problem that must be addressed [22] . Government policies that would encourage more medical students to step into this rapidly developing field and to build high-quality training systems for child psychiatrists are both suitable strategies.",
