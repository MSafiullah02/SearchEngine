Regions must fulfill what the White House has defined as \u201cgating criteria\u201d to allow progress to phase 1 of re-opening.2 These criteria include:A downward trajectory of cases with influenza-like illness or COVID-like symptoms within 14 daysA downward trajectory of documented COVID-19 cases or positive tests (as a percentage of total tests) within 14 daysHospitals are treating patients without crisis careRobust testing programs are in place for at-risk health care workers.Phase 1 of re-opening would allow resumption of elective surgeries as clinically appropriate on an outpatient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines. If a region shows no rebound in the number of cases and satisfies the 14-day gating criteria a second time, it can move to phase 2, in which \u201celective surgery can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an out- or inpatient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines.\u201d2 If a region then shows no rebound in the number of cases and satisfies the 14-day gating criteria a third time, it can move to phase 3, in which surgery can fully resume, and other social restrictions can be relaxed (e.g., unrestricted staffing of worksites, limited physical distancing in large venues).",

The early recovery phase is characterized by fewer COVID-19 cases each day and greater availability of limited resources such as PPE, health care workers, ventilators, ICU beds, and testing. In the late recovery phase, the facility is more than 14 days beyond its peak, and resources are at near normal levels. The ACS document4 gives specific suggestions for prioritizing cancer cases in the acute and late recovery phases for patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, thoracic malignancies, pancreatic and periampullary cancers, soft tissue sarcoma, and melanoma.",

Some confusion may result from the fact that phase 1 of recovery mentions only performance of outpatient procedures, and that individual states may have different criteria mandated by their governors. Therefore, surgeons must work closely with their hospital leadership and local authorities to determine whether they fall within the pandemic or recovery phases, and whether they meet gating criteria as well as CMS and state guidelines. If these standards are met, then it would be reasonable for hospitals to resume elective surgeries for cancer patients, which could include both in- or outpatient procedures because few cancer cases would be considered as truly elective.7",

Afterward, other cancer cases can follow based on prioritization as to which patients are most likely to have compromised outcomes with further delays. It is important for health care workers to be aware that there could be a resurgence of COVID-19 cases related to seasonal changes (in the fall or winter), as social distancing practices are relaxed, or as a result of other currently unforeseen factors. Should this happen, these events could again lead to severe restrictions in cancer care delivery and a return to these triage guidelines for cancer patients. All guidelines will also need to be updated periodically as both COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing become more universally available, effective drugs are identified, and/or a successful vaccine is developed.",
