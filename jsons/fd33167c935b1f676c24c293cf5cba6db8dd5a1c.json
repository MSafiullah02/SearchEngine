Like other coronaviruses, PEDV N protein is a nucleocapsid protein and abundantly presents at all stages of infection. Previously, we reported that the N protein of trypsin-independent PEDV 8aa is cleaved during virus replication. In this study, we further investigated the nature of N protein cleavage using various methods including protease cleavage assays with or without various inhibitors and mutagenesis study. We found that PEDV 8aa infection in Vero cells leads to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f apoptotic cell death, and caspase 6 or 7 can cleave PEDV 8aa N protein at the late stage of the replication. The caspase-mediated cleavage occurs between D 424 and G 425 near the C-terminal of N protein. We also report that both cleaved and uncleaved N proteins are exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells.",

PEDV can cause an enteric disease (PED) with high mortality of up to 100% in neonatal piglets. There are at least two genogroups with PEDV with classical genogroup 1 and newly emerging genogroup 2 Jung and Saif, 2015) . Genogroup 1 PEDV has circulated among countries in Europe and Asia since the early 1980s . In 2010, new highly pathogenic Chinese PEDV strains emerged and classified into Genogroup 2 (Li et al., 2012) . The first US outbreak with genogroup 2a PEDV occurred in 2013 (Stevenson et al., 2013) and subsequently in Canada and Mexico (Anastasia et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Pasma et al., 2016) , resulting in the death of 7 million pigs during one year epidemic period (Cima, 2014) . Moreover, there are several reports that the US PEDV strains (genogroup 2) caused outbreaks in European (Grasland et al., 2015; Hanke et al., 2015; Theuns et al., 2015) and Asian countries Lin et al., 2014; Van Diep et al., 2015) , which raised significant economic and public health concerns worldwide (Schulz and Tonsor, 2015) .",

Among them, N protein is an abundant structural protein present at all stages of infection. The coronavirus N protein is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f composed of multiple domains including N1 (or N-terminal domain), N2 (or C-terminal domain) and N3 with spacers between them (Hurst et al., 2013) . Both N1 and N2 are very basic and interact with viral RNA genome and/or N protein (Hurst et al., 2013) . N3 is the carboxy-terminal part (~45 aa) with an excess of acidic residues and known to interact with M protein (Hurst et al., 2005; Verma et al., 2006) . The primary role of N protein is to act as an essential architecture component in coronavirus assembly through the interactions with N, M and viral RNA (Cavanagh and Cavanaugh, 1997) . In addition to its primary role, N protein appears to perform multiple functions in the viral replication cycle and pathogenesis (McBride et al., 2014) . Some previous research suggests that the N protein correlates with optimal coronavirus RNA transcription and/or replication, by acting as RNA chaperones to assist the template-switching steps (Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2007; Zuniga et al., 2010) , and participating in the replicase components for efficient RNA synthesis (Hurst et al., 2013; Hurst et al., 2010) . In several studies, N protein was also shown to be involved in host cell signaling and immune responses to facilitate viral replication (Cao et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2013) .",

The N protein cleavage was implied for playing roles in efficient viral replication and pathogenicity (Diemer et al., 2008; El\u00e9ou\u00ebt et al., 2000) . For PEDV N protein, Jaru-Ampornpan et al. demonstrated that virally-encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) cleaves N protein during virus replication and the cleavage is associated with viral adaptation in cell culture (Jaru-Ampornpan et al., 2017) . Previously, we reported two forms of N protein from the protease independent PEDV 8aa strain, while only one form from the protease dependent PEDV KD strains (Kim et al., 2017) . We hypothesized that the two forms of N protein are generated by a post-translational modification by host or cellular protease(s) during the replication of PEDV 8aa strain. Here, we demonstrated that the N protein of PEDV 8aa strain is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis of Vero cells. The PEDV N protein was cleaved by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f caspase 6 or 7 between D 424 and G 425 near the C-terminal of N protein. Furthermore, N protein was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells regardless of N protein cleavage. Our results demonstrated characteristics during the replication of PEDV 8aa, which provides valuable information to understanding the PEDV biology.",

PEDV 8aa strain shows some distinct characteristics including protease independence, no cell fusion formation, efficient virus replication (viral titers reach over 10 8 TCID 50 /ml), and putative N protein cleavage (Kim et al., 2017) . In this current study, we confirmed that these bands are both N proteins by analyzing the two protein bands at approximately 49 and 47 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). Next, we examined the kinetics of N protein cleavage in the cells (cell lysates). The cleaved N protein appeared at 36 and 48 hpi, but not at 24 hpi ( Figure 1A , left lanes). The ratios of the intact(N) and cleaved(N') N protein were approximately 1:1 for both 36 and 48 hpi ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, scarcely detectable cleaved N protein from PEDV KD strain grown in the presence of trypsin (1 \u03bcg/ml) was observed only at 48 hpi ( Figure   1A , right lanes). Of note, PEDV KD infection produced extensive cell-fusion and cell lysis after 24 hpi, which resulted in reduced levels of N protein in 36 and 48 hpi ( Figure 1A , right lanes).",

The biological significance of the virus-induced apoptosis and N protein cleavages is still unclear, but it is suggested to be involved in the pathogenicity (Diemer et al., 2008; El\u00e9ou\u00ebt et al., 2000) . In this study, we demonstrated similar findings to TEGV and SARS mediated apoptosis in protease independent PEDV 8aa strain. The cleaved N band (N') appeared at the late stage (after 36 hpi) of 8aa infection ( Figure 1A ) and required caspase activities because the N' product was abolished by the addition of pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk) ( Figure 1B ). This cleavage was closely associated with the virus-induced apoptosis evident with TUNEL staining and the DNA fragmentation at 48 hpi ( Figure 2 ). However, the N protein of PEDV KD was barely cleaved during virus replication ( Figure 1A ). Because PEDV KD, a trypsin-dependent strain, causes extensive cell fusion formation with lysis at 24hpi without cellular apoptosis (Figure 2) , there were significant differences in the virus-induced cell death by these two different PEDV strains.",

In a host defense point of view, apoptosis curtails the use of cellular machinery necessary for viral protein synthesis and facilitates the elimination of viral proteins through caspase-mediated proteolysis, resulting in the reduction of viral replication and spread (Danthi, 2011; Yan et al., 2010) . Thus, viruses in diverse families encode anti-apoptotic proteins (Clem et al., 1991) to limit apoptosis. On the other hand, viruses can take advantage of the apoptosis of host cells to facilitate virus replication. Various viruses have utilized caspases to cleave their viral proteins for successful replication, which is aborted when the caspase cleavage sites on the viral proteins are eliminated (Best et al., 2003; Moody and Laimins, 2009) .",

The underlined bold italic nucleotide in each primer is for the change in the mutagenesis analysis. The mutated sequence in each plasmid was confirmed by sequencing analysis. Each mutated N protein was expressed in 293T cells by transfecting the cells with each mutated plasmid and they were subjected to conduct cell-free cleavage assay with the recombinant caspases 6. Antiviral effects of GC376 on PEDV in cell culture. Because the previous report suggested that PEDV 3CLpro can cleave N protein (Jaru-Ampornpan et al., 2017), we used a 3CLproinhibitor(GC376) to determine its effect on N protein cleavage. First, we examined the effectiveness of GC376 against PEDV replication and determined the effective concentrations inhibiting 50% and 90% of viral replication (EC 50 and EC 90 , respectively). Serial concentrations of GC376 were added to confluent Vero cells in 24-well plates and the cells were promptly infected with PEDV 8aa at an MOI of 0.01. The cells were then further incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of GC376 until an extensive cytopathic effect was observed in the mock-treated well (up to 48 h). After three times freezing and thawing of the plates, viral titers were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR as described previously(Kim et al., 2017). The TCID 50 equivalents/ml was calculated by a standard curve generated from the CT values plotted against the corresponding TCID 50 titers/ml. The EC 50 and EC 90 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis (four-parameter variable slope) using GraphPad Prism software version 6.07 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). To determine whether 3CLpro or caspases cleave N protein, GC376 (20 \u03bcM), Z-VAD-fmk (100 \u03bcM) or DMSO (Mock) was added to PEDV 8aa-infected Vere cells at 24 h after virus inoculation. Cells lysates were prepared at 0, 12 and 24 h (24, 36 and 48 post virus inoculation (hpi), respectively) after the addition of the inhibitors for Western blot analysis as described above.",

A confocal microscopystudy was performed to determine whether N protein cleavage affects the localization of the N protein.Semi-confluent Vero cells on Lab-Tek II CC2 chamber slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA) were inoculated with PEDV 8aa strain at an MOI of 1 in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (100 \u03bcM) or DMSO. Following 1h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed three times with PBS, replenished with fresh media containing the same concentration of Z-VAD-fmk and further incubated for 36 h at 37\u00b0C. In another experiment, PEDV KD strain was used to infect the cells on Lab-Tek II CC2 chamber slide, and the cells were incubated for 12 h in the presence of trypsin (1 \u03bcM) at 37\u00b0C. Also, Vero cells were transfected with pIRES-N-nHA and incubated for 24 h. The cells in these experiments were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10min at RT, washed three times with PBS and further incubated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with Mab against PEDV N protein for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS and further incubated with FITC-labeled secondary antibody against mouse IgA, IgG or IgM (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) for 1h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were also stained with SYTOX orange (Invitrogen, CA) for 15 minutes.

KD infected cells started to show cell-to-cell fusion from 12hpi and showed extensive cell-to-cell fusions and syncytium formations at 24hpi, but no TUNEL positive cell was observed at 12 and 24hpi. To confirm the progress of apoptosis in 8aa infected cells, the DNA fragmentation assay was conducted. As expected, the low molecular weight DNA from the 8aa infected Vero cells showed a typical feature of apoptosis, fragmentation of DNA (Figure 2C), whereas the mockinfected cells did not show any sign of DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of caspase by the addition of Z-VAD-fmk led to significantly increased PEDV 8aa replication compared to mocktreated(DMSO) cells (Figure 3). Caspase 6 or 7 cleave N protein at D 424 G 425 . To determine which caspase cleaves N protein, a cell-free cleavage assay was performed with mock treatment(PBS) or the recombinant caspase 3, 6 or 7. The Western blot analysis demonstrated that caspase 6 or 7 cleaved PEDV N protein, whereas caspase 3 did not cleave the N protein (Figure 4). The mutation study on the four mutated N proteins carrying a single mutation of D 345 G, D 372 G, D 424 G or D 427 G at the putative caspase cleavage site showed that D 424 G mutation abolished the N protein cleavage by caspase 6 (Figure 5), which revealed N protein cleavage occurs between D 424 G 425 (Figure 5). PEDV 3CLpro did not affect N protein cleavage. First, the inhibitory effects of GC376 against PEDV 8aa were determined with the EC 50 and EC 90 at 2.75 and 3.84 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6A). To examine the effect of 3CLpro on N protein cleavage, GC376 at 20 \u00b5M was added at 24 hpi, and the N cleavage was monitored at 36 or 48 hpi. The addition of GC376 or Mock (DMSO)",
