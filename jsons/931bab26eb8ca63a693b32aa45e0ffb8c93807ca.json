Without N95 respirator (N95) mask protection, health care providers are at risk for contracting COVID-19. Full-face snorkel masks seal tightly against the skin and could serve as surrogates for medical N95 masks. Several studies have documented the effectiveness of airway filters to prevent contamination of anesthesia equipment with bacteria and viruses. [1] [2] [3] Although snorkel masks and airway filters have been used for this purpose, no evidence regarding their effectiveness has been forthcoming. Accordingly, we investigated whether a full-face snorkel mask with an airway filter satisfied the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) N95 standards for protection against airborne pathogens and whether the combination was tolerated.",

Full-face snorkel masks channel inspiration and expiration through separate passageways within the facemask, with the exhaled breath directed from the breathing compartment into 2 lateral channels. With minimal or no exertion as in surface snorkeling, there is no perceived resistance to expiration while wearing these masks. However, during moderate exertion, some swimmers reported dyspnea, tingling in their legs, or an inability to exhale easily. Rarely, unexplained cardiac arrest has occurred. Our results confirmed that even with an airway filter tightly applied to the fitting in a full-face snorkel mask, there was no perceptible increase in inspiratory or expiratory effort at rest. This is unsurprising because these conditions are analogous to a patient breathing through a filter and anesthesia breathing circuit. However, patients are not exercising while breathing through an anesthesia breathing circuit. Despite modifying the snorkel mask, we encountered no signs or symptoms of dyspnea or increased resistance to breathing while performing moderate exercise for 10 minutes. We did not identify substantive changes in cardiorespiratory indices that would point to a limitation in using the modified mask for periods of up to 20 minutes at rest or 10 minutes of moderate exertion ( Figure 5) .",
