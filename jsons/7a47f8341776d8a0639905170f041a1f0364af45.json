            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak is posing unprecedented risks and challenges for all communities and healthcare systems, worldwide. There are unique considerations for many adult patients with gliomas who are vulnerable to the novel coronavirus due to older age and immunosuppression. As patients with terminal illnesses, they present ethical challenges for centers that may need to ration access to ventilator care due to insufficient critical care capacity. It is urgent for the neuro-oncology community to develop a pro-active and coordinated approach to the care of adults with gliomas in order to provide them with the best possible oncologic care while also reducing their risk of viral infection during times of potential healthcare system failure. In this article, we present an approach developed by an international multi-disciplinary group to optimize the care of adults with gliomas during this pandemic. We recommend measures to promote strict social distancing and minimize exposures for patients, address risk and benefit of all therapeutic interventions, pro-actively develop end of life plans, educate patients and caregivers and ensure the health of the multidisciplinary neuro-oncology workforce. This pandemic is already changing neuro-oncologic care delivery around the globe. It is important to highlight opportunities to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of glioma management during this pandemic and potentially, in the future.",

While much remains to be discovered about the novel coronavirus, observations in China indicate that 2.3% of patients required ventilator support and 1.4% of patients died. 1 Reports from Italy suggest a higher death rate, near 7%, and we may expect geographic variation based on populations, testing availability and health systems. 2 Higher severity of illness and death appear to be associated with older age, diabetes, cardiopulmonary disease and immune depression. 3 There is also concern that cancer patients and cancer survivors are more likely to get infected with the novel coronavirus and are more likely to die from complications of COVID-19. 4 In addition, during times of quarantine and social distancing, cancer patients may have difficulty accessing life-extending care and supports. Asymptomatic spread, high infectivity rate and rapid expansion of disease amongst individuals in a community contribute to exponential growth. With only weeks of lead time to recognition that the novel coronavirus is present in a new region, our local health care systems are anticipated to have insufficient ventilator capacity to manage all patients. 5 Stark choices will need to be made, as in Italy, prioritizing interventions for some patients over others. 6 The burden on the health care system is likely to require difficult considerations for determining medical resource utilization. 7 The unbearable truth in neuro-oncology is that many adults with gliomas, who may be both older and with terminal diagnoses, may be denied ventilator care in favor of younger patients with better chances of long-term survival. Avoiding exposure and preventing infection especially during periods of viral surge is, therefore, our absolute priority.",

Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines to assist surgeons and hospitals in their decision to delay surgical intervention suggest that surgical interventions for low risk cancers be postponed. 13 In patients with presumed low grade gliomas and therefore, presumed slow growth rate, an observational approach with a repeat MR scan in months (3-6 depending on clinical variables) rather than active treatment or shorter intervals between imaging may be optimal. Diagnostic surgery and adjuvant therapy can be safely delayed, especially if the patient presents with only limited and stable neurological symptoms and further tumor growth will not preclude complete resection. In patients with imaging features suggestive of high grade gliomas, standard of care maximal safe resection should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis and create a tailored treatment plan, especially in younger adults and those with high performance status. In patients undergoing resections, the use of implanted BCNU wafers can still be considered in individual cases as this does not involve an additional exposure. In older patients with frailty and comorbid conditions, surgical biopsy or resection might need to be abnegated and further treatment strategies may have to be based on the radiological findings alone. For all patients, integration of molecular features, age, extent of resection and performance status are critical to predict prognosis and the potential benefit of added therapies. Tools such as the EORTC GBM calculator (https://www.eortc.be/tools/gbmcalculator/) or the Geriatric 8 (G8) scale can help in objective decision making and ensuring that decisions are not based on chronologic age alone. 14 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 11 Procedures to maintain safety of patients and healthcare workers during radiation therapy have been developed and should be followed. 15 Patients with MGMT-unmethylated gliomas may not derive as much benefit from incorporation of temozolomide and based on age and performance status, a multi-disciplinary team must work with patients and their families to determine the optimal course of treatment.",

Finally, as we are faced with decisions on what tests, therapies and images we can delay, we should welcome the opportunity to have a dialogue about and redefine what is truly necessary for the healthcare of our patients with gliomas. As a profession, we are used to complexity, uncertainty and tragedy-and the resilience we have developed from the care of our patients will serve us well. Captions: ",

            "text": "wildtype (IDHwt) gliomas constitute the majority of high-grade tumors in adult neuro-oncology patients. These tumors can grow rapidly in short periods of time and deferral of therapy beyond the anticipated length of the pandemic carries a high risk of tumor growth, increased neurological morbidity, and in some cases, earlier death. Patients with O-6methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylated tumors are likely to gain the most from temozolomide concurrent with radiation and potentially in the adjuvant setting. In these cases, depending on patient clinical characteristics, the benefit of standard of care therapy consisting of a full course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, likely exceeds the risk of death from COVID-19. Patients receiving tumor-treatment field therapy need to take precautions to minimize exposures when getting assistance from technicians or family members with array placement and this need for frequent contact should be considered in discussions with patients about this treatment modality. Even during \"maximal aggressive\" treatment for adults with malignant glioma, we should be limiting in-person visits in favor of telehealth, performing toxicity checks remotely and only at the absolutely required intervals in order to limit patient exposure. Conservative dosing in patients who may show signs of bone marrow toxicity may help to avoid immunosuppression, consequent inpatient admission or visits for platelet transfusions. If a patient develops viral symptoms while undergoing chemotherapy, they should be tested immediately and chemotherapy should be stopped. If the patient tests positive for COVID-19, chemotherapy should be held until the patient recovers fully from the infection and risks and benefits of therapy should be re-evaluated at that time. The most common laboratory finding at presentation of COVID-19 in China was lymphopenia, occurring in more than 80% of patients 1 and for patients receiving temozolomide and with suspected infection, this laboratory finding will need to be interpreted in the context of treatment-induced lymphopenia 1 .",

Extra precautions may include screening patients for viral symptoms, restricting caregivers from accompanying patients and the use of protective equipment for patients and medical staff are warranted. Institutional policies are required to protect the safety of both patients and healthcare workers. In the event that a patient develops viral symptoms during radiation therapy, a low threshold for testing is warranted. Radiation therapy can continue in patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection as long as their disease is mild and the radiation facility has measures in place to prevent spread to other patients and staff. These measures include concurrent use of appropriate personal protective equipment for both staff and patients as well as thorough disinfection of all surfaces between patients. In cases where patients have significant viral symptoms, treatment should be halted and resumed only after the patient recovers.",
