The area is challenged by overcrowding, inadequate WASH, shelter and insufficient healthcare services. Internationally promoted measures (social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown) are not impossible. We model outcomes, according to three scenarios, should there be a COVD-19 outbreak. We aim to: 1. Predict the numbers of cases, including severe and critical ones, and deaths. 2. Identify critical time points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed due to COVID-19.",

All-population Scenario One and Two apply to the total population of 4.17 million and for 8 weeks from the first case. They differ in that Scenario One assumes a medium doubling rate (every 4 days), and is thus more optimistic, while Scenario Two assumes a fast doubling rate (every 3.2 days) which is less optimistic. Camppopulation Scenario only to the 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and tented settlements along the Turkey-Syria border. This scenario predicts a bad-case scenario in a very crowded population with limited access to social distancing, appropriate shelter and adequate WASH.

The study models use three scenarios. Scenarios One and Two apply to the total population of 4.17 million and for 8 weeks from the first case while the Camp-population Scenario applies only to the 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and tented settlements. For each scenario, we identify critical time-points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed assuming a highly conservative estimate that 50% of regular hospital (ward) and ICU beds can be occupied by COVID-19 patients.",

Scenario Two is more realistic but is still not the worst-case scenario in NW Syria given the nature of overcrowding, inadequate shelter and poor access to WASH services. In this scenario, the health system is unable to cope beyond the fifth week. The Camp-population Scenario describes a situation whereby unmitigated spread in crowded displacement camps will lead to total health system collapse within the first four weeks of an outbreak. Considering that such a scenario can occur concurrently with Scenario Two (or a worse All-population Scenario Three not presented here whereby doubling rates and clinical attack rates would be higher), the epidemic outcomes can be catastrophic.",

In reality, this would be extremely difficult considering high rates of occupancy of regular and ICU hospital beds (88%, 98%, respectively) and ongoing high levels of violence and injuries in NW Syria, meaning health system capacity is likely to be overwhelmed much sooner than the projected critical time-points. As COVID-19 patients require prolonged ventilator support, 22 ventilators could become rapidly saturated with patients who are unable to be rapidly weaned. Our study did not account for this factor. It will be simply impossible to manage the predicted critical cases expected during the first eight weeks, in all scenarios, resulting in significant excess mortality.",

However, the baseline capacity of the health system in NW Syria is already significantly constrained. Therefore, there is very little extra capacity that can be gained by postponing non-urgent cases. 22 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30566-3/fulltext All rights reserved.

There are also other risks of spread in crowded urban spaces especially during the holy month of Ramadan and Eid celebrations, lack of safety/protection should hostilities resume, lack of awareness and or interest in taking preventative measures by local population (i.e. given urgent situation outside of the pandemic). This could result in far greater and more rapid spread of COVID-19 among the population whose conditions are already poor. With insufficient numbers of community-based isolation, inpatient ward and ICU beds and ventilators, a COVID-19 epidemic in NW Syria could result in thousands of excess avoidable deaths.

This forecasting report uses globally reported estimates for key parameters such as doubling rate, attack rates and case-fatality rates. It is possible for the situation in NW Syria to be different, either negatively or positively, thus substantially altering projections. This necessitates repeating these projections based on actual figures during an outbreak as has been done in other settings. Our study did not use age-specific projection (such as CFR). The COVID-ESFT does not incorporate populationspecific factors, such as population age structure, prevalence of comorbidities particularly chronic conditions, and population density, and health system factors, such as bed availability and health workforce readiness, both of which can affect epidemic outcomes. As such, our findings should be considered basic and further modeling is needed to take such factors into account. Unfortunately, there is limited prior research on COVID-19 in similar conflict-affected settings 23 to guide such modeling and epidemic projections. The COVID-ESFT considers an exponential growth model, which does not reflect a real epidemic curve that is seen in epidemics and pandemics. Furthermore, the COVID-ESFT only projects an estimate for the first six to eight weeks of an outbreak from the first case. Should an outbreak occur, real-time epidemiological data would be incorporated into the model to provide better forecasting. The study does not take into account the impact of important factors that can affect epidemic spread and outcomes: current preparedness and expected future interventions by the local authorities to control the spread of COVID-19 during the expected epidemic and the impact of community-based mitigation measures such as social distancing, self-isolation or shielding. More broadly, our knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving; more understanding of its epidemiologic characteristics may alter this (and other) forecasting models. 23 Johns Hopkins, COVID-19: Projecting the impact in Rohingya refugee camps and beyond Summary All rights reserved.

NW Syria presents many challenges to such measures included an already overwhelmed and underfunded health system, insufficient testing, challenges of implementing internationally used approaches e.g. self-isolation, social distancing, strict lockdowns and a population affected by a protracted conflict of whom 67% are IDPs and around one quarter live in camps or tented settlements.
