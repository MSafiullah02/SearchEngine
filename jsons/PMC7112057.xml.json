            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs; family Coronaviridae) are the etiological agent(s) of respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in animals and humans. The first coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus) was isolated in chicken embryos in 1937 (Beaudette and Hudson, 1937), with subsequent viral isolations in rodents, domestic animals, and humans. However, until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002/3 (Drosten et al., 2003, Woo et al., 2009), coronaviruses had been of greater concern to agriculture than public health. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV intense scientific efforts have been directed toward characterizing additional coronaviruses in humans and other animals (Drexler et al., 2010, Guan et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Quan et al., 2010, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2012). As a consequence, the number of coronaviruses identified has increased rapidly (Woo et al., 2009, Woo et al., 2012). Of particular importance was the recent discovery of a new severe respiratory illness with renal failure (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Bermingham et al., 2012, van Boheemen et al., 2012), and which is also a zoonosis (Annan et al., 2013, Azhar et al., 2014, Reusken et al., 2013). It is highly likely that there are additional unrecognized coronaviruses circulating in animals.",

Rodents are a major zoonotic source of human infectious diseases (Meerburg et al., 2009, Luis et al., 2013), particularly as they often live at high densities and hence may harbor high levels of microbial diversity (Moya et al., 2004). In addition, some rodent species live in close proximity to humans, such that they represent an important zoonotic risk. To date, however, only one species of coronavirus \u2013 Murine coronavirus \u2013 has been associated with rodents (de Groot et al., 2011). The prototype virus, which was named mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), was first isolated in mice in 1949 (Cheever et al., 1949), with a variant then identified in rats in 1970 (where it was termed rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus) (Parker et al., 1970). No other rodent-associated CoVs have been discovered since this time.",

Recombination appears to be commonplace in coronaviruses (Graham and Baric, 2010, Jackwood et al., 2012, Keck et al., 1987, Woo et al., 2006), and which may facilitate their emergence. For example, two types of feline CoVs (FCoV) \u2013 FCoV type I and II \u2013 have arisen by double recombination events between FCoV types I and canine Coronavirus (CCoV) (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Similarly, recombination generated the three genotypes (A, B and, C) of human coronavirus HKU1 (Woo et al., 2006), and homologous recombination has occurred in the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV (Graham and Baric, 2010).",

Hence, these data suggest that LRNV is sufficiently divergent that it represents a novel species of coronaviruses according to the criteria for species demarcation in the subfamily Coronavirinae defined by the International Committee on Taxomony of Viruses (ICTV) (de Groot et al., 2011). With respect to the other two viruses, LRLV Longquan-189 was <90% similar to known members of the genus Betacoronavirus in the ADRP and NendoU regions, suggesting that it represents a new variant of murine coronavirus (see phylogenetic analysis). Although LAMV Longquan-343 was nearly 90% similar in the conserved replicase domains to betacoronavirus 1 (i.e. Human coronavirus OC43, Bovine coronavirus, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and Rabbit coronavirus HKU14) and <90% to other members of the genus Betacoronavirus (Table S2), it does not exhibit sufficient sequence divergence to represent a new virus species.

A previous description of the genome organization of CoVs (de Groot et al., 2011) was used as a reference. LRNV (Lucheng-19) had a genome of 28,763 nucleotides, with a G+C content of 40.2%. Its genome organization was similar to those of members of the genus Alphacoronavirus, with the characteristic 5\u2032-replicase ORF1ab-S-envelope(E)- membrane(M)-N-3\u2032 gene order (Fig. 2,\nTable 2, Appendix A). The replicase ORF1ab (20,249 nucleotides in length) includes 16 predicted nonstructural proteins (nsp) (Table S3). In a manner similar to Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 and human coronavirus NL63, LRNV possessed the core part of the putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) 5\u2032-AACUAA-3\u2032 upstream of the 5\u2032 end of each ORF with the exception NS4, with variable nucleotides matching the leader core sequences (Table 2). Additionally, LRNV contained NS7a and NS7b genes between the M and N genes (Fig. 2), and which are observed in no other members of the genus Alphacoronavirus. Perhaps the most striking feature of the LRNV genome was that NS2 encodes a putative nonstructural protein of 275 amino acids located between the replicase ORF1ab and the S gene (Fig. 2, Table 2). A BLAST search revealed that this NS2 had no amino acid sequence similarity with alpha-CoVs, but possessed approximately 42% amino acid identity with the NS2a of lineage A of beta-CoVs. Hence, this is suggestive of a homologous recombination event between alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs (and which was confirmed in the phylogenetic analysis below).",

Similarity plots suggested the presence of three recombination breakpoints at nucleotide positions 19,294, 19,979, and 22,112, which separated the genome into four regions (Fig. 5A). In turn, these could be grouped into two putative \u2018parental regions\u2019; region A (nt 1 to 19,915 and 20,600 to 22,784) and region B (19,915 to 20,600 and 22,784 to the end of the sequence). In parental region A, Longquan-708 was most closely related to Longquan Rl Rat coronaviruses, while in parental region B it was more closely related to MHV. This recombination event was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses, in which the alternative grouping of Longquan-708 was supported with high bootstrap values (Fig. 5B and C).",

All analyses were performed with a Bonferroni corrected P-value cutoff of 0.01. When putative recombination events were observed by two or more methods and with significant phylogenetic (topological) incongruence, the viral sequences were considered as potentially recombinant. To further characterize these recombination events, particularly the location of breakpoints, we inferred similarity plots using Simplot version 3.5.1 (Lole et al., 1999). For each of the putative recombinant regions, phylogenies were estimated using the ML method performed with PhyML v3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010) under the best-fit substitution model determined by jModelTest (Posada, 2008).",
