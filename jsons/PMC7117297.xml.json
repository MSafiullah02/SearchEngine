            "text": "The pathogenesis of AEEC has been studied mainly on human EPEC strain E2348/69 (Nataro et al., 1985). It is a three-step model (Knutton, 1994). First, the bacteria adhere to the epithelial cell via the production of fimbriae. Second, the bacteria secrete proteins (i.e. EspB encoded by the eaeB gene) which are responsible for the transmission of a signal to the epithelial cell (Kenny and Finlay, 1995). These cells respond by an increase in phosphorylations and in intracellular Ca2+ level. The Ca2+ ions activate villin which severs actin filaments leading to the destruction of microvilli. Third, the bacteria adhere intimately to epithelial cells. This intimate attachment is correlated both with the expression by the bacteria of a 94 kDa outer membrane protein called intimin and with the accumulation of cytoskeletal compounds such as actin in the cell beneath the bound bacteria. The intimin is encoded by the eaeA gene. This gene is present in human and in bovine AEEC as demonstrated by colony hybridization studies using the EaeA probe (Jerse et al., 1990; Mainil et al., 1993). Moreover, the intimin has been demonstrated to be a virulence factor in vivo (Donnenberg et al., 1993a).",

Verotoxins are E. coli cytotoxins which are lethal for cultured Vero cells (Konowalchuck et al., 1977). These toxins share a number of properties with Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae and are therefore also called Shiga-like toxins (O'Brien and La Veck, 1983). Verotoxins consist of two groups, with VT1 (SLT-I) constituting one group and VT2 (SLT-II) and antigenically related toxins constituting a second group (Newland et al., 1988). The VT1 and VT2 encoding operons were sequenced (Jackson et al., 1987a, Jackson et al., 1987b). EPEC and EHEC strains have been described in several animal species including cattle (Chanter et al., 1984). A previous study indicated that most bovine AEEC were actually EHEC-like strains (Mainil et al., 1993).",

Among the possible infectious agents, the `attaching and effacing' strains of E. coli (AEEC; Moon et al., 1983) have been associated with diarrhea and dysentery in calves up to 2 months of age (Butler and Clarke, 1994; Mainil et al., 1993). However no large scale epidemiological study has been carried out to verify this association mainly because of the difficulty in the diagnosis of the AEEC. We performed such a study in calves dead from diarrhea, in diarrheic calves, and in healthy calves, based on the detection, either by colony hybridization or by PCR, of the eaeA gene coding for the intimin protein, an adhesin which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AEEC, which is essential for the production of AE lesions by bovine AEEC (China et al., 1997; Goffaux et al., 1997), and which is produced in vivo during infection in man (Donnenberg et al., 1993a).",

Determination of the serotype may help in confirming this hypothesis but was not performed on the AEEC isolated from live calves in this study. Otherwise AEEC isolates from dead calves in Belgium belong to O5, O18, O26, O111, and O118 serogroups (Mainil et al., 1993; data not shown), and the rate of isolation of O157 isolates is very low in Belgium at slaughterhouses (Mainil et al., unpublished data; G.
