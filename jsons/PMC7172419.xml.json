Episodes of diarrhea lasting more than 14 days are referred to as persistent diarrhea.",

Both the incidence and risk of mortality from diarrheal diseases are greatest among children younger than 1 year of age, and thereafter rates decline incrementally.4\n",

EPEC strains are associated with chronic diarrhea in children but rarely cause disease in adults. EIEC strains cause bloody mucoid diarrhea and share many biochemical and pathogenic properties with Shigella organisms. Watery diarrhea also is seen, and fever is a common finding. EHEC strains also cause bloody diarrhea, and severe hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome are seen in as many as 6 to 8 percent of infections.

Infants and the elderly appear to be at greatest risk, but all age groups are susceptible to salmonellosis. Animals are the major reservoir for Salmonellae, and different serotypes predominate among reptiles, fowl, and mammals. The acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that may be watery or, less frequently, dysenteric characterize most cases of Salmonella gastroenteritis. Fever occurs in approximately 70 percent of affected children. Bacteremia occurs in 1 to 5 percent of patients, most frequently in infants. Enteric fever, which classically is associated with Salmonella serotype Typhi (typhoid fever) or serotype Paratyphi A, B, or C, also is seen rarely with non-Typhi serotypes. Typhoid fever is identified most frequently among school-age children but also presents in a milder form in children 2 years of age and younger. In children, the disease not uncommonly presents with diarrhea, with or without blood, but it is characterized by fever lasting 3 or more weeks. Complications of typhoid fever include intestinal hemorrhage and perforation, myocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, and shock.39\n",

Neonatal infections are common occurrence but often are asymptomatic.21 The incidence of clinical illness peaks in children between 4 and 23 months of age. Rotavirus is associated with gastroenteritis of above-average severity. Thus, the proportion of episodes of diarrhea attributable to rotavirus increases with increasing severity of illness, from 6 to 8 percent of all diarrhea episodes in the community to 15 to 20 percent of episodes requiring outpatient therapy to 25 to 40 percent of episodes requiring hospitalization. Children often are infected with rotavirus multiple times, and each infection confers progressively greater immunity.41 Therefore, severe disease occurs most commonly in young children with first or second infections.",

Cloning and sequencing of the genome of Norwalk and several other HuCvs have allowed for the development of polymerase chain reaction-based assays for detection of virus in stool and enzyme immunoassays for detection of serologic responses.44 These assays show that noroviruses are the most common cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis and that they affect all age groups, whereas sapoviruses affect primarily children.45, 46 The etiologic role of noroviruses in moderate-to-severe childhood gastroenteritis in developing countries is being studied, but preliminary data from industrialized countries indicate that they may be the second most common viral agent after rotavirus, accounting for 4 to 19 percent of episodes of severe gastroenteritis in young children.23\n",

The prevalence of G. lamblia is low (approximately 2 to 5%) among children in developed countries but can be as high as 20 to 30 percent in developing regions.28 Although often asymptomatic, infection with Giardia organisms can lead to significant anorexia and growth impairment in a small proportion of cases. Infections with both Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora organisms are common occurrences among children in developing countries, but they frequently are asymptomatic. For example, a recent study from Peru showed that children younger than 12 years of age had an average of 0.20 episodes of cyclosporiasis annually and 0.22 episodes of cryptosporidiosis annually but more than two-thirds of infections caused by both agents were asymptomatic; the proportion of cases that resulted in clinical illness declined with increasing age.49 In the developed world, diarrheal infections of parasitic origin are uncommon occurrences and usually restricted to persons who recently traveled to regions where such pathogens are endemic. However, vigilant surveillance for waterborne diseases50, 51 and the advent of several recent outbreaks of cryptosporiodosis and cyclosporiasis in the United States52, 53, 54 and other developed regions55, 56 brings attention to the increasing importance of parasites as human enteropathogens worldwide.",

Features of hypernatremic dehydration, such as irritability and doughy feel to the skin, should be sought specifically because this condition requires specific rehydration methods. Stool cultures usually are indicated only in cases of dysentery or to determine the etiology of an outbreak or to monitor antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens.",

Treatment with antimicrobials is recommended for Campylobacter infections in immunocompromised persons and in those with extraintestinal infections. Erythromycin and azithromycin dihydrate are the agents most commonly used for treatment of Campylobacter infections, but increasing resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolone agents has been noted in many countries.76 Antimicrobial treatment also decreases the duration of illness of cholera, fluid requirements, and duration of excretion of V. cholerae and may be used in severe cases as an adjunct to rehydration therapy. Trimthoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used to treat younger children, whereas doxycycline or tetracycline are used more often for older children and adults. Treatment with antimicrobial agents limits the duration and severity of shigellosis and is recommended when the illness is characterized by bloody stools or high fevers.77 However, Shigella organisms rapidly acquire resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents and strains of Sd1 resistant to all commonly used antimicrobial agents, including fluoroquinolones, recently have been reported from Bangladesh and India, raising the specter of potentially untreatable infections.78 Appropriate treatments for Shigella spp. include, but are not limited to, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and pivmecillinam; more extensive lists have been published elsewhere.79 The specific antimicrobial for empiric treatment should be based on the regional endemicity, resistance patterns, and availability of Shigella spp. Antimicrobial treatment of non-Typhi salmonellosis should be reserved for extraintestinal infections, but specific antimicrobial therapy with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is indicated to shorten the duration of symptoms and lower the risk of the development of complications for children with illness caused by S. typhi.76 Oral nitazoxanide is recommended for the treatment of diarrheal illness associated with G. lamblia or C. parvum, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective for treating cyclosporiasis.76\n",

Infectious human or animal wastes and contaminated water should not be used to fertilize or irrigate fruits and vegetables, especially those grown close to the soil and eaten raw (eg, lettuce).

They also have constructed a S. flexneri 2a vaccine mutated at virG and the iron-scavenging locus iuc. In clinical trials, ingestion of 106 or 108 CFU of this strain (SC602) caused symptoms of mild shigellosis in most volunteers, whereas a dose of 104 caused only mild symptoms in a few volunteers.117 In subsequent challenge studies, volunteers who ingested a single dose of 104 CFU were protected against challenge with wild type S. flexneri 2a. Noriega and coworkers (Kotloff K, personal communication 2004)have had similar success with a S. flexneri 2a strain harboring mutations in the metabolic locus guaBA and the putative enterotoxin loci set and sen. This strain, designated CVD 1208, is well tolerated at doses up to 109 CFU and provides strong serum and intestinal antibody responses.",

The initial development of rotavirus vaccines was based on the Jennerian approach, which involved the use of a live-attenuated, antigenically related virus derived from a nonhuman host such as a bovine or rhesus strain. Later, after observations in vaccine challenge cross-protection studies in animals suggested that serotype-specific immunity may be important in protection, vaccines were developed by using a modified Jennerian approach, in which animal-human reassortants expressing VP7 proteins of different serotypes were used as the immunogens. More recently, live-attenutated vaccines based on rotavirus strains derived from young children and neonates have been developed.",

This vaccine, a tetravalent rhesus-human reassortment rotavirus tetravalent vaccine (RRV-TV), was developed to target the four most common G serotypes of rotavirus, G1-G4. However, RRV-TV was withdrawn in 1999 when it was linked causally with intussusception at an estimated rate of 1 case per 11,000 vaccinated infants, and the manufacturer stopped its production. Other rotavirus vaccines are being developed. Two vaccine candidates, a pentavalent bovine rotavirus-human rotavirus reassortant vaccine (Merck & Co. Research Laboratories, West Point, PA) and a monovalent human rotavirus vaccine (Glaxo SmithKline, Philadelphia, PA), are currently in large-scale clinical efficacy trials. Preliminary trial results have shown that these vaccines are efficacious, and evaluation of the safety of their use in children is ongoing.148 A key question that remains unanswered to date is whether Merck\u2019s multivalent rotavirus vaccine, which theoretically should provide better protection against multiple rotavirus strains, offers significant clinical benefits compared with Glaxo SmithKline\u2019s monovalent vaccine. Trial data that address this question are awaited keenly, as theoretically a monovalent vaccine could be produced through a simpler technology and at a lower price and, therefore, be less expensive and more widely available for use in global immunization programs.",

However, the challenge of preventing the estimated 1.4 to 2.5 million deaths caused by diarrhea annually persists. Further reduction of the rate of mortality from diarrhea will require adoption of the best practice guidelines for management of children with diarrhea and appropriate use of prevention strategies. The efficacy of ORT in reducing severe diarrhea has been established unequivocally, but global ORS coverage rates remain less than 50 percent, and efforts must be made to improve coverage.19 Although encouraging progress has been made in reducing the rates of mortality from diarrhea and the potential for future reductions clearly is evident, efforts to protect children from acquiring diarrheal diseases have been less successful. A wide range of preventive measures related to environmental and host factors have been developed and are being refined and implemented, yet significant impact on the global incidence of diarrheal diseases has been elusive. This matter calls for those working in the field, whether on development of vaccines, promotion of micronutrient supplementation and breastfeeding, or novel approaches to water, sanitation, and hygiene, to redouble their efforts, and for the governments and financial interests who support these endeavors to redouble their commitment.",
