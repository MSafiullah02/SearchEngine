Hence stricter guidelines have been enacted for such high-risk populations. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended social distancing and limiting visitors to nursing homes. Nationally, many nursing homes have essentially gone into lockdown. Arkansas has followed the same quarantine protocol as most of the early cases of COVID-19 in the state occurred in nursing homes. Caregivers are prohibited to bring food or person items or visit their loved ones due to concern about the contagion. This necessary and well-meaning quarantine has resulted in an unintentional consequence of increased stress in an already vulnerable population.",

Approved telehealth equipment is sometimes cumbersome and difficult to master/operate by older adults with cognitive impairment and with or without hearing loss. It is important to overcome these barriers as the use of social technology is linked to higher subjective well-being and lower depressive symptoms among older adults (Chopik, 2016) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, government agencies have issued an emergency waiver to suspend the requirement of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and have allowed permission to use popular applications for video chats, such as Apple FaceTime and Facebook Messenger video chat, which are not HIPAA compliant (Wright and Caudill, 2020) . This change is welcomed by geriatric healthcare providers. We present a case wherein interaction with family members using FaceTime improved the quarantine-induced behavioral problems in a nursing home patient with Alzheimer's disease.",

He was generally stable both physically and cognitively before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other medications, he was on memantine, and there were no recent changes. His daughters were very engaged in his care and would often visit him and bring home-cooked food. He was noted to have a worsening of behavioral problems after the visitations were stopped due to the pandemic. The daughter reported that her father had increased confusion and anxiety, poor appetite and was \"hard to handle\". The daughter reported that she had difficulty communicating with him over the phone. Patient could not understand why his daughters stopped visiting him, which they had been doing daily before the pandemic.",

She took home-cooked food with hope that the nursing home staff could pick it up and was disappointed when they turned her back. A phone assessment was performed by the geriatric psychiatrist for the increasing behavioral problems. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Cummings et al., 1994 ), a global screen for behavioral problems seen in dementia, showed that the patient was experiencing increased depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and general restlessness. Several nonpharmacological interventions including increased contact (even if only virtual) with family members was recommended. The staff and his daughter came up with an innovative solution to FaceTime. The nursing home administration was receptive to the idea because of recent loosening of restrictions (Wright and Caudill, 2020) . His daughter was able to make video calls using FaceTime. The patient was reported to communicate well as he could \"lip read\" during the video session. The daughter reported that her father enjoyed the sessions and seemed to be less anxious and agitated by the end of the video calls. Staff reported that after a series of such video calls, the patient was pacing less and had an improved appetite. The daughter reported that FaceTime had provided a sense of connectedness and had positive impact on his symptoms.",
