(2015) a large outbreak of chikungunya emerged in 2004 in coastal Kenya; in 2005 it spread to the Indian Ocean islands and subsequently to India and many countries in Southeast Asia, causing several million cases. In 2007 cases of chikungunya were first reported from Europe: infected air travelers imported the disease into France and Italy, which led to local autochthonous transmission. It turned out that the virus had adapted to a new vector, Aedes albopictus, facilitating viral spread to an even wider geographic region. Further factors contributing to the magnitude of the outbreak were an increase in air travel to and from affected areas, previous lack of exposure to the virus of the newly involved populations, and spread of Ae. albopictus from its native Asia to islands of the Indian Ocean basin and to Southern Europe. In 2013 a further large outbreak originated on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. It rapidly spread through the Caribbean, to the United States, to Latin America, and to French Polynesia, causing several million cases. This was the first time a chikungunya outbreak had officially been recorded in the Western hemisphere.",

Even though it usually causes a mild illness, the development of subsequent Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been reported in a number of cases. Zika was known to be endemic in Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2007, an outbreak of Zika virus infection occured on Yap island (Micronesia). These were the first recognized cases outside Africa and Asia. The emergence of ZIKV on the isolated island community showed the potential of the virus to spread through commerce and travel across long distances. An even larger outbreak occurred in 2013-2014 in French Polynesia, causing an estimated 32,000 cases and spreading within the region. In the context of this outbreak, cases related to international travel were reported by Zammarchi et al. (2015) in two Japanese, one Norwegian, and two Italian travelers. A number of further travel-related cases of Zika virus were reported. Interestingly, one scientist returning to the United States from Cameroon with ZIKV later infected his wife, probably by sexual transmission, as discussed by Foy et al. (2011). In 2015, Zika was first detected in Brazil, leading to autochthonous transmission of the virus.",

Dengue is also on the rise in formerly non-endemic areas such as Europe and East Asia as a consequence of increasing migration, the tourist industry, international trade, and demographic changes. Quam et al. (2015) show an increasing trend of imported dengue into Italy and project a further fourfold increase by 2020. Recent dengue fever virus outbreaks as reported by Knope et al. (2013) in Australia, China, Japan, France, and Italy were linked to importation of the virus in infected travelers and the presence of Aedes mosquitoes in the local environment, which promoted subsequent human-to-human spread in the local populations.",

Nevertheless, the number of malaria cases recorded in international travelers is decreasing. Emerging, however, is the number of cases of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria seen in travelers. P. knowlesi was first described in the 1920s as a simian malaria parasite, and it was not known to infect humans until the 1960s when it was found in malaria patients in Malaysia. This led to its recognition as the fifth human malaria parasite. In 2006 it first appeared in the context of travel medicine when a Swedish traveler returning from Malaysia was diagnosed with P. knowlesi infection. Muller et al. (2014) in their review highlight several reports of imported P. knowlesi cases in travelers from all over the world. P. knowlesi is not geographically restricted to Malaysia but was also found in Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines and may well occur in jungle or forest areas in other countries of the region. On microscopy P. knowlesi closely resembles Plasmodium malariae. It is therefore not completely clear if the parasite is truly emerging or has rather been misclassified in the past. Travel in or near forested areas is considered a risk factor. Cases are mostly mild, but severe and fatal cases have been reported (Chapter 20).",
