The index patient travelled to Nanjing on Jan 21, 2020, from Xiaogan (about 70 km from Wuhan), and switched trains in Wuhan. After arriving in Nanjing, she stayed with two of her sisters (patients 1 and 2) and her mother (patient 3) at their family home. She had a family dinner with her mother, two sisters, and her brother (patient 4) on Jan 21. The index patient had another family dinner with eight relatives on Jan 23. She had been well without any symptoms of infection but started to have a fever and cough on Jan 28. She went to Zhejiang on Jan 24, where she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on Jan 29. No one in the family cluster had travelled to Wuhan in the previous 2 weeks except for the index patient. Three patients (patients 1\u20133) who lived together with the index patient and three relatives (patients 4, 6, and 7) who attended the dinner with the index patient on Jan 23 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection thereafter. Furthermore, patient 5 who lived with patient 4 and had no direct contact with the index patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection on Jan 30. On Jan 24, two patients (patients 6 and 7) who had been well without any symptoms attended another family dinner with 13 relatives. Three of the relatives (patients 8\u201310) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection within 2 weeks.",
