Even where precautions and screening are taking place, asymptomatic carriers can infect pregnant women or their infants with coronavirus [5]. Further, research staff and healthcare providers are at increased risk if they do not heed infection prevention precautions including the use of personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. Nurses who draw blood or test for HIV, will be at highest risk because of the proximity to patients and potential for patients who cough or sneeze on them during blood draws and HIV testing.",

            "text": "HIV incidence is high during pregnancy and breastfeeding [2] with HIV acquisition risk more than doubling during pregnancy and the postpartum period compared to when women are not pregnant [14]. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the mean HIV incidence rate among pregnant and breastfeeding women was 3.6 per 100 person-years (95% prediction interval: 1.2\u201311.1) [1]. In Cape Town, a study demonstrated that HIV incidence was 1.86/100 person-years in postpartum period (95% confidence interval 0.88\u20133.89) with a very high vertical transmission to 28% infants [15]. HIV acquisition during pregnancy and postpartum translates to a substantial cumulative period of risk over the course of women\u2019s lives in sub-Saharan African regions where both fertility and HIV prevalence are high [2]. Additionally, acute maternal HIV infection during pregnancy and breastfeeding threatens maternal health and increases the risk of vertical transmission accounting for an estimated 30% of new HIV infections in some settings [10, 16, 17]. In South Africa, an estimated 76,000 (95% CI 64,000\u201390,000) new cases of vertical transmission are expected over the 2020\u20132030 period [18]. By providing PrEP in pregnancy, we estimate a significant reduction of over 41% with PrEP uptake in 80% of pregnant women, or 13% if one-third of high-risk women take PrEP [18]. Coronavirus could cause appreciable morbidity in pregnant women and infants, requiring hospitalization which could have lifelong implications for chronic lung disease, bronchiectasis\u2014though there is limited evidence of this risk in pregnant women [19, 20].",

Consequently, the risks of intimate partner violence, rape and HIV acquisition will also rise [12, 13]. The South African government reported over 87,000 cases of gender based violence reported across the country in the first week of the coronavirus lockdown [20]. We have never lived through an epidemic like this in which people are forced to stay home, oftentimes in very tight conditions. In a South African township, living conditions are extremely crowded. Socializing is unavoidable. Many don\u2019t have water and need to stand in queues to get water or food. The major components recommended-social distancing and hygiene\u2014are extremely difficult to implement in much of Africa. In this new world of societal lockdown, pregnant and breastfeeding women who were once at low risk of HIV acquisition could now be at high risk. In a migratory society, male partners are now home and are no longer migrating, increasing sexual exposure in a population where condomless sex is high and many women have limited power to effectively negotiate condom use [22, 23]. Finally, HIV is a lifelong virus that affects the most vulnerable in our society, regardless of age. Though there is effective treatment of HIV, there is no vaccine or cure for HIV.",
