The genome encodes a 370-kDa polyprotein precursor, which is processed by viral and cellular proteases into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) involved in virus replication (Fields et al., 2001). Among other proteins, the multi-functional protein NS5 is particularly important for viral replication. The C-terminal domain of NS5 is endowed with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, while its N-terminal domain contains S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) activity. The MTase domain is involved in the last two steps of the capping process that starts with the conversion of the 5\u2032-triphosphate end of the nascent RNA into a 5\u2032-diphosphate (RNA triphosphatase activity), followed by the addition of a GMP unit via a 5\u2032\u20135\u2032 phosphodiester bond (guanylyltransferase activity). MTase, then, transfers a methyl group from AdoMet to the N7-atom of the cap guanine and, successively, to the ribose 2\u2032O-atom of the first RNA nucleotide forming the \u2018cap 0\u2019 and \u2018cap 1\u2019 structures, respectively.",

Since flaviviral MTase displays both N7 and 2\u2032O activities (Ray et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2007), in order for capped RNA to be methylated at the two different sites the nucleic acid substrate must adopt two distinct binding modes relative to the enzyme active site. In particular, many structural results (Assenberg et al., 2007, Bollati et al., 2009, Egloff et al., 2002, Egloff et al., 2007) show that small capped RNA analogues bind to a MTase high affinity binding site (HBS), where they are supposed to be held during 2\u2032O methylation. On the contrary, structural details on a distinct binding site occupied by capped RNA during N7 methylation are missing. Structural considerations, however, suggest the existence of a secondary, putative low affinity binding site (LBS) (Dong et al., 2008a, Mastrangelo et al., 2007) located in a positively charged region close to the AdoMet binding site. Here, we first present a model of a short capped RNA (GpppAGUp) bound to the LBS of Wesselsbron virus MTase (WvMTase), that is used to explore the details of protein/RNA interaction during N7 methyl transfer. Based on this analysis, we then discussed an in silico search that allowed to select three synthetic compounds, predicted to display low free energy of binding to WvMTase. The compounds selected were tested in vitro on WvMTase and DvMTase in 2\u2032O and N7 methyltransferase activity assays. The results of the combined computational and experimental screening allowed us to identify aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as the most potent flaviviral MTase inhibitor known to date. The inhibitory effect of ATA is discussed here on the basis of existing models of the flaviviral MTase mechanism for N7 and 2\u2032O cap methylation. Since flavivirus MTase has been shown by mutagenesis to be crucial for viral replication (Zhou et al., 2007), shedding light on MTase inhibition may prove a productive path towards the development of therapeutics against life threatening flaviviral diseases (Dong et al., 2008a, Dong et al., 2008b).",

Hydrogen atoms and computed Gasteiger charges (Gasteiger and Marsili, 1978) were added after removing the HBS-bound RNA analog, maintaining the AdoMet cofactor bound to the protein. A squared grid (30 \u00c5 side) centered roughly in the LBS region between Ser56 and Arg84 (Autogrid4; step size 0.375 \u00c5, 80 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 80 = 512,000 points) (Goodford, 1985) was subsequently built and used as the volume explored in the capped RNA docking searches. The short capped RNA GpppAGUp molecule was then built using the program Ghemical (http://www.bioinformatics.org/ghemical). Seventy genetic algorithm searches were performed using Autodock4, moving GpppAGUp within the described grid and using 32 active torsions in the ligand molecule (with 150 individuals in population and 27,000 generations; Morris et al., 1998). The search produced a list of 70 capped RNA positions within the explored LBS volume, ranked by means of the Estimated Free Energy of Binding (\u0394G) that varied between \u22123.32 and \u221212.43 kcal/mol. Among the four best \u0394G values (in the \u221211.74, \u221212.43 kcal/mol range) the model with the cap Guanine N7 atom closer to the AdoMet methyl group was chosen (\u221211.86 kcal/mol; AdoMet-CH3\u2013N7-RNA distance 7.3 \u00c5). Such model (WvMTase/GpppAGUp) was then used as starting structure for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, performed using the program GROMACS (van der Spoel et al., 2005). Briefly, the protein with AdoMet and the docked capped RNA (GpppAGUp) were enclosed in a box of 61 \u00c5 \u00d7 68 \u00c5 \u00d7 91 \u00c5 filled with 11,688 water molecules and 6 Cl\u2212 ions for charge equilibration. Using the GROMACS force field (GROMOS-87 with corrections as in Mark et al., 1994), the energy was minimized with a steepest descent algorithm, and the system was then equilibrated at 10 K for 1 ps and at 100 K for 5 ps. The MD simulation was carried out with time step of 1 fs using a leap-frog algorithm and periodic boundary conditions; electrostatic interactions were treated with Fast Particle-Mesh Ewald algorithm, while van der Waals interactions were cut-off at 12 \u00c5; the simulation was performed at fixed T (300 K) and P (1 atm) using Berendsen coupling (Berendsen et al., 1984). The structure produced after 9 ns was used as final model for the analysis of protein/RNA interaction.",

As docking model the atomic coordinates of WvMTase in complex with AdoMet and N7MeGpppG were chosen (pdb 3ELW) (Bollati et al., 2009), keeping both the protein and the AdoMet molecule and removing water and the cap-analogue. Hydrogen atoms and computed Gasteiger charges were added using the program Autodock4 (Gasteiger and Marsili, 1978). The protein model was then used to build a discrete grid within a box with dimensions 23 \u00c5 \u00d7 15 \u00c5 \u00d7 26 \u00c5 (Autogrid4; step size 0.375 \u00c5, 60 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 70 = 168,000 points) (Goodford, 1985) for the compound docking search. The search (i.e. the grid center position) was centered in a wide crevice located between the AdoMet binding site and the RNA HBS, more precisely between residues Lys182 and Arg213. In this way the protein active site, where the methyl transfer from AdoMet occurs, is completely included in the search grid chosen. Twenty genetic algorithm searches were run using Autodock4 for each compound in the LOPAC library (with 150 individuals in the population and 27,000 generations) (Morris et al., 1998).",

For the determination of IC50 values of the ATA compound a concentration range from 0.12 to 125 \u03bcM was tested. Reactions were incubated at 30 \u00b0C.

Liquid scintillation fluid was added and methylation of RNA substrates was measured in counts per minute (cpm) using a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux Liquid Scintillation Counter.

In performing such analyses, we chose to discard few N- and C-terminal residues of the protein, focusing on amino acids 8\u2013260, thus ignoring the motility of the protein terminals. We used a cut-off of 0.7 \u00c5 in C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. to cluster the different structures observed during MD time evolution. With such limitation we found that the structures generated during the simulation could be grouped into nine different clusters, and that the last cluster contained all the states produced after the first 70 ps, suggesting an early stabilization of the protein scaffold during the simulation. The same cluster analysis was carried out to investigate the structural evolution of capped RNA during the simulation. With a 0.8 \u00c5 cut-off, 32 capped RNA clusters were produced, the last one starting at 3.85 ns and lasting through the end of the simulation (9 ns). The 0\u20133.85 ns interval can be interpreted as the time needed for RNA to reach a stable conformation following interaction with the protein, starting from the docked model. R.m.s.d. values calculated for the simulated structures vs. the crystal structure, during MD, reached the mean value of 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5 r.m.s.d. after about 3 ns of equilibration.

In this model (Fig. 1A and B), the cap guanine was located close to AdoMet and to residues Glu149 and Arg213; other residues found to interact with capped RNA were: Arg37, Arg41, Leu44, Ser56, Arg57, Arg84, Glu149, Lys112, Ser150, Arg160, Ser215. It has been recently shown that point mutations of few amino acids dramatically inhibit N7 methyl transfer activity in WNvMTase (Dong et al., 2008a). In particular, seven amino acids (Arg37, Arg57, Arg84, Trp87, Glu149, Arg213, and Tyr220), whose mutation to Ala reduced the mentioned activity below 30%, have been identified. In this context, analyzing the role of interface residues indicated by our WvMTase/RNA simulated model, we propose to neglect Trp87 and Tyr220. In fact, these two residues are spatially close to each other, and partly buried in the protein core; it can be expected that their mutation to Ala might critically alter the correct MTase fold. Moreover, Tyr220 is located at the \u201cfloor\u201d of the MTase catalytic tetrad region (K-D-K-E: Lys61-Asp146-Lys182-Glu218 in WvMTase), being hydrogen bonded to Lys61 (3.2 \u00c5) and to Asp146 (2.9 \u00c5); thus it may play a crucial role in the stabilization of the catalytic residues. As a result, our WvMTase/RNA interaction model focuses on the five remaining residues (Arg37, Arg57, Arg84, Glu149, and Arg213; Fig. 1B).",

In particular, the search for compounds competing with AdoMet binding has been considered as one of the promising approaches (Luzhkov et al., 2007, Ray et al., 2006). AdoMet is the principal biological methyl donor in cells; under normal conditions in humans 6\u20138 g of AdoMet are generated per day, and most of these are used in transmethylation reactions whereby methyl groups are added to different compounds and AdoMet is converted to AdoHcy (Lu, 2000). We thus speculated that MTase inhibition based on AdoMet competition might be particularly difficult to achieve. Moreover, since many distinct enzymes require AdoMet as cofactor, an AdoMet mimetic compound (like sinefungin; IC50 of 14 \u03bcM on WNvMtase) (Dong et al., 2008b) may turn out to be generally toxic. Therefore, a different inhibitor search strategy could, in principle, be directed towards blockage of the MTase HBS; however, such class of inhibitory molecules would likely provide inhibition only for the 2\u2032O MTase reaction, but not for the N7 MTase activity. Therefore, for the design of new inhibitors, we decided to target the active site of the enzyme with its bound AdoMet cofactor.",

This consideration suggests that a small ligand, binding to a protein location close to (but not inside) the cofactor-binding site, would potentially impair both N7 and 2\u2032O methylation reactions. Moreover, such a ligand could interact directly with AdoMet or AdoHcy, potentially slowing the release of the latter from the protein during enzyme turnover. As target for ligand docking, we thus selected the active site region, located between the AdoMet binding site, the HBS, and the LBS (Fig 2A), that had been explored by our simulated model described above. The selected region was explored using a library of small molecules (LOPAC library) as described in Section 2. The search produced a list of compounds with predicted free energy of binding (\u0394G) ranging between +9.0 and \u221216.2 kcal/mol. The top three ranked compounds produced by the docking search (nilutamide, PPNDS and ATA, Fig. 2A), displaying the lowest binding energies (\u0394G\n = \u221216.2, \u221213.4, and \u221212.4 kcal/mol, respectively), were used for in vitro testing of MTase inhibitory activity (Fig. 2B).",

Fig. 3B shows dose\u2013response curves that yield IC50 values of 4.2 \u03bcM (\u00b10.2 \u03bcM) for WvMTase and of 2.3 \u03bcM (\u00b10.3 \u03bcM) for DvMTase.

In order to determine whether ATA inhibited the flaviviral N7 MTase activity we synthesized an RNA corresponding to the first 351 nucleotides of the Dv genome (Dv1\u2013351 RNA) using T7 polymerase, and capped the RNA by addition of [\u03b1-32P]-GTP using vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase (see Section 2). We expected that Dv1\u2013351 RNA would be an appropriate substrate for WvMTase because the first three nucleotides of the capped RNA genomes of both viruses are GpppAGU and it had been shown that, besides the presence of the stem loop structure, the conservation of second and third nucleotide were especially important for specific N7 MTase activity (Dong et al., 2007). The capped Dv1\u2013351 RNA was incubated with WvMTase in the presence of increasing ATA concentrations and the reaction products were analyzed after nuclease P1 digestion by TLC and autoradiography. Fig. 4A shows that in the absence of WvMTase (CTL-), radiolabeled GpppA released from the substrate RNA by nuclease P1 is detected at the expected position. In the presence of WvMTase (CTL+), almost 55% of GpppA was converted into a new product co-migrating with the N7MeGpppA cap analog, as standardly visualized by UV shadowing. At longer incubation times part of N7MeGpppA was further methylated into N7MeGpppA2\u2032OMe (not shown). We conclude that, under these optimized reaction conditions, the RNA corresponding to the first 351 nucleotides of the Dv genome, is a good substrate to specifically follow the N7 MTase activity of WvMTase. We next determined the IC50 values of ATA inhibition on both MTases, by quantifying the GpppA conversion into N7MeGpppA in the presence of increasing ATA concentrations after 20 min, during the linear phase of the N7 MTase reaction. ATA inhibits the N7 WvMTase activity at higher concentrations than those observed in the 2\u2032O MTase assay, the IC50 value being 38 \u03bcM (\u00b12 \u03bcM) compared to 4.2 \u03bcM, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4B, ATA moderately inhibits the N7 DvMTase activity, with an IC50 value of 127 \u03bcM (\u00b16 \u03bcM), compared to IC50 of 2.3 \u03bcM, for the inhibition of the 2\u2032O DvMTase activity. Thus, our results indicate that ATA inhibits the N7 MTase activity of Dv and Wv to a minor extent compared to the 2\u2032O MTase activity.",

In particular, ATA interacts with many positively charged amino acids conserved in flavivirus MTases (Arg37, Arg41 (mostly conserved), Arg57, Lys61, Arg84, and Arg213) and establishes a hydrogen bond with the 3\u2032O atom of the AdoMet ribose, contributing to cofactor stabilization in its binding pocket. Interestingly, the docked model indicates a hydrogen bond between an ATA hydroxyl group and the side chain of Lys61, part of the conserved catalytic tetrad (K-D-K-E) that supports the 2\u2032O MTase activity. Thus ATA, bound at the site predicted by docking and MD, may impair the correct location of RNA in the catalytic site through steric hindrance and through interaction with residues involved in RNA recognition.",

Starting from our WvMTase crystal structure (Bollati et al., 2009), we proposed a model of the protein/RNA interaction during N7 methylation activity (no crystal structure available so far). We then used the proposed (LBS) RNA binding site to select three compounds out of 1280 that were screened by means of a docking analysis in silico. Among the three best ligands identified we showed by in vitro inhibitory assays that ATA is a potent inhibitor of flaviviral 2\u2032O MTase activity for both Wv and Dv. ATA also inhibited the Wv and Dv N7 MTase activity on longer RNAs, but to a minor extent. The efficient inhibitory action of ATA against 2\u2032O MTase activity is consistent with its specific interaction with residue Lys61, as indicated by docking. Indeed, this residue was previously shown to be important for 2\u2032O MTase activity but not for N7 MTase activity (Zhou et al., 2007). Moreover, since N7 MTase and 2\u2032O MTase assays were performed on RNA of different lengths, it is possible that the different IC50 values found reflect a difference in the affinity for the RNA substrates in the inhibition assays. Taken together, our results demonstrating the inhibitory capability of ATA (in the micromolar range) support the hypothesis that the LBS (adjacent to the MTase-bound AdoMet) which is targeted here as a new inhibitory site may be suitable for drug lead development.",

Moreover a recent patent (WO/2005/123965) indicates a possible inhibitory role of ATA against SARS corona virus. In the same patent, results indicating generic activity of ATA against flaviviruses are also reported. The authors of the patent, however, do not propose a model explaining the reported antiviral efficacy. The results here presented suggest a specific molecular target and a possible mechanism for the inhibitory activity of ATA against flaviviruses. As a cautionary note, it should be recalled that ATA has been generally reported in the literature as a non-specific inhibitor of several different enzymes (Bina-Stein and Tritton, 1976). In fact, ATA appears to be able to impair different kinds of protein/nucleotide interactions; therefore, it may also play yet unknown roles in the inhibition of other viral replication processes beyond RNA capping. Moreover, considering ATA's capability of inhibiting protein/nucleotide interactions, we cannot exclude different/further effects, even on MTase, such as the blockage of the HBS site (key RNA binding site for 2\u2032O methylation), or effects resulting in a decreased protein affinity for AdoMet.",
