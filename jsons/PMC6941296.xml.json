Intensive care units (ICUs) are often described as the epicenter of AMR and intensive care physicians in Europe are increasingly facing patients infected by bacteria for which limited or no adequate therapeutic options are available [1]. The use of last-line antibiotics has been increasing, including in particular the use of colistin in Southern and Eastern European countries as described by the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-Net) [2]. Only a few new antibiotics have been marketed in recent years and they are not always available for use in ICUs in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EAA) countries [3].",

ARISE follows a first survey conducted in 2009 [4] among the members of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). Since 2009, the AMR situation in Europe has worsened considerably with, for example, increased proportions of third-generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone and carbapenem resistance in invasive Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, even if there has been a stabilization of resistance proportions in recent years [5, 6]. Multiple factors may contribute to the spread of AMR in European countries including cross-border transfer of patients carrying MDR bacteria, transmission of high-risk bacterial clones in and between hospitals and other healthcare settings, overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents and varying infection control practices and staffing [7\u201310]. A second survey was therefore conducted in 2017 among physicians working in European ICUs with the aim to determine their current perception of infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the use of last-line antibiotics.",

The substantial proportion (12.4%) of ICU physicians who reported that they had, during the preceding six months, at least one patient with an infection caused by a bacterium resistant to all or almost all antibiotics available in their ICU is of concern.

In 2016, EARS-Net reported a wide variation in AMR depending on the bacterial species and the geographical region with higher percentages of AMR being reported by countries in Southern and Eastern Europe. Our multivariate analysis of factors influencing the perception of AMR confirmed the role of the European sub-region, with ICU physicians in Eastern and Southern sub-regions more frequently ranking MDR bacteria in their ICU as a major problem. The other factors significantly associated, in the multivariate analysis, with a higher ranking of perception of AMR as a problem were related to (a) the number of admissions and the type of ICU, which are likely proxies for patient populations with different risks for infection with MDR bacteria, and (b) the lack of protocols for empiric treatment, which might be a sign of the absence of antibiotic stewardship activities that could improve antibiotic prescribing and control of MDR bacteria.",

Secondly, our study showed that the recently approved cephalosporin-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations targeting infections with resistant Gram-negative bacteria: ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, that received marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union in 2015 and 2016, respectively [17, 18], were not always available in ICUs in EU/EEA countries. However, we were not able to differentiate between non-availability of these antibiotics at national level or at hospital level (e.g. because of cost or organizational reasons). We also did not assess whether availability meant rapid availability from the pharmacy or whether last-line antibiotics had to be ordered from other providers or countries with a delay that may impact appropriate management of severely ill ICU patients. Many respondents mentioned carbapenems in the category \u2018other\u2019 last-line antibiotics (data not shown), although they were not included in our list of proposed last-line antibiotics.

However, there were differences in the scale used to measure the perception of AMR, which prevents more detailed comparisons. In 2009, 50 (53%) respondents declared having treated at least one patient with a bacterium totally or almost totally resistant to available antibiotics during the preceding six months, which is a higher percentage than the result of the 2017 survey (12.4%). This might be explained by the much lower number of respondents and possible selection bias of these respondents in 2009 as well as possibly by a changing perception, among ICU physicians, of what constitutes \u201ctotally or almost totally resistant\u201d and should therefore be interpreted with caution.",

The preferred option was \u201cfaster/better microbiological diagnostic tools\u201d. This is not surprising in the ICU context where the timely replacement of an empiric antibiotic regimen with targeted treatment is of utmost importance. New diagnostic tests are under development, but there might be barriers to their use, often related to costs [28]. Furthermore, the correct use of these new tests is important and, as stated by Messacar et al. [29], diagnostic stewardship is required to direct the appropriate tests to the right patient. \u201cOpportunities for training/education of clinicians for better use of existing antibiotics\u201d was the option ranked second by the respondents, while \u201cnew antibiotics\u201d was only ranked fifth suggesting that ICU physicians have more trust in antibiotic stewardship and better targeted use of existing antibiotics than in new antibiotics that might possibly become available in the future [30, 31]. The fact that \u201cmore resources for infection control\u201d was ranked third is encouraging, as this indicates that ICU physicians are aware of the close relationship between cross-transmission, ICU acquired-infections and antimicrobial use and that AMR cannot be controlled without the implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures and the involvement of ICU physicians in such activities. An interesting example of such involvement is the control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Israel by a national intervention [32]. \u201cMore opportunity for specialist consultation\u201d was ranked as the least preferred option, indicating that ICU physicians (or at least the respondents to our survey) have sufficient access to infectious disease specialists or consider that their level of competence allows them to manage antimicrobial treatment in severely ill patients.",
