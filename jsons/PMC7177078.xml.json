This 3-step monitoring process is referred to as \u201ccontact tracing\u201d (WHO 29): 1) Contact identification \u2013 after a person has a confirmed infection, identification of contacts involves interviews to identify the person's activities, and roles of people around them since the onset of illness. Contacts include anyone who has been in contact with the infected person \u2013 family members, work colleagues, friends, and health care providers. 2) Contact listing \u2013 Any persons known to have contact with the infected person are listed as \u201ccontacts\u201d, and efforts are made to identify each contact, inform them of their at risk status, actions to follow, information about accessing early care, and disease prevention and mitigation strategies \u2013 quarantine or isolation is required for high risk contacts. 3) Contact follow-up \u2013 is a painstaking, resource intensive, and expensive process, though technologic advances can diminish the intensity of such tasks. Regular follow-up of close contacts generally consists of daily telephone calls, text messaging, and/or in-person inquiries about fever and other symptoms for 14 days after the last known exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19. If and when close contacts develop new or worsening symptoms, they are referred for diagnostic testing and appropriate treatment.",

The rapid spread of COVID-19 has the potential to overwhelm primary and acute services as experienced in China11 and Italy.21 The challenge to deliver oncology services is further compounded by COVID-19 infection spread to nursing and medical personnel, school closures, all of which impact staffing levels. Moreover, to create new local COVID-19 services means that there is an on-going re-shuffling and re-allocating of resource (human and budget) which puts additional strain on existing services that were already at full capacity. Figures from China's National Health Commission demonstrated that more than 3300 healthcare workers were infected, and 22 had died related to COVID-19.40 As the pandemic accelerates providing PPE to deliver safe oncology services is a key concern worldwide.12 If acute care services are at maximum capacity, institutions may provide alternative provisions for the care of people affected by cancer. Therefore, oncology nurses will need to be flexible to facilitate the safe delivery of alternative models of care. Alternative and adaptive models of care could increase the use of community care or private facilities.",

Second, should surgery suites and personnel be seconded elsewhere or are unavailable, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be considered for timely delivery of oncologic manoeuvres for some malignancies. Hypofractionated radiotherapy protocols should be prescribed whenever possible,41 including single fraction treatments for uncomplicated bone metastases.42 Third, protective approaches such as PPE and personal space modifications should be considered, see Table 3\n. During chemotherapy administration, treatment beds or chairs should be placed with adequate space (1.5 meters) to prevent close contact as much as possible. Limiting or eliminating family attendance, while stressful, may be necessary in limited chemotherapy suite spaces. In such cases, portable technology such as smart phones or iPads could be loaned during the treatment session for patient and family support and subsequently disinfected between patient usage. Finally, more intensive surveillance during and in the recovery period should be considered when patients with cancer are infected with COVID-19, especially older patients and those with multiple co-morbidities.12\n",

The planning branch focuses on resources (human and material), situational, documentation and demobilization. Planning is essential as traditional units may become COVID units and staffing models may need to be adjusted due to patient surge. The logistics branch focuses on supplies and support of the HCWs and oncology patients. Logistics plays a critical role with oncology HCWs related to PPE and what is required to care for a COVID patient versus routine administration of chemotherapy when shortages of many products (goggles, masks, gloves, gowns) exists. This branch may also support processes related to N95 mask collection for reuse and sterilization.
