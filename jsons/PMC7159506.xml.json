TGEV dramatically affects the porcine industry production. According to reports, the mortality rate in neonatal piglets infected with TGEV is approximately 100%. In spite of vaccine therapy, TGEV infections continue to be a concern in the porcine industry. TGEV enters the host by first attaching its glycoprotein (S protein) to the host cellular surface receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN)(Delmas et al., 1992). Traditional animal breeding is time\u2010consuming, money\u2010consuming and progress is extermely slow. On the other hand, gene knock\u2010out and knock\u2010in strategies are powerful for investigating gene function in livestock and have potential biotechnology applications in farm animal breeding(Lillico et al., 2013; Richt et al., 2007; Whitworth et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2011). Knock\u2010out of the pathogenic host cellular receptor may represent an effective strategy to investigate the molecular mechanism of the host cellular response and accelerate the livestock resistant breeding progress (Richt et al., 2007; Whitworth et al., 2016).",

We speculated that the pathology of TGEV is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in TGEV infections could be beneficial for preventing infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). Similarly, pAPN is a host cellular receptor for porcine deltacoronavirus and K88(Li et al., 2018; Melkebeek et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2018). The production of pAPN site\u2010specific edited pigs could be beneficial for understanding the pathogenesis of porcine deltacoronavirus and K88 for breeding porcine deltacoronavirus and K88\u2010resistant pigs as well. In addition, APN plays a critical role in tumor formation and is a receptor for tumor\u2010homing peptides(Mina\u2010Osorio, 2008; Zhang, Fang, Zhang, Yuan, & Xu, 2011). Investigating the interactions between APN and tumor\u2010homing peptides will lead to a better understanding of cancer biology and more effective APN\u2010based cancer treatments.",

The gene\u2010editing with the homologous recombination is clearly superior to random mutation gene\u2010edting.The production of gene\u2010edited livestock through somatic cell nuclear transfer is also superior to pronuclear injection, because it is easier to determine the sex of the animal and the least genetic variation can be yielded, which will accelerate the livestock breeding progress. In addition, the high off\u2010target rates were often found in gene\u2010editing cells and animals generated by CRISPR\u2010Cas9 technology (Kosicki, Tomberg, & Bradley, 2018; Pattanayak et al., 2013), which could impair animal welfare and cause some unpredictable side effects. In order to protect animal welfare and some unpredictable side\u2010effects in off\u2010target. If the off\u2010target sites on the same chromosome, eliminating the off\u2010target effect is very difficult. If the off\u2010target sites on the different chromosome, eliminating the off\u2010target effect need six generation of breeding in general, which is time\u2010consuming, money\u2010consuming and progress is extermely slow. Here, we strongly recommend TALEN in combination with somatic cell nuclear transfer but not CRISPR\u2010Cas9 in combination with pronuclear injection in livestock gene\u2010editing breeding, especially in single gene\u2010edting in uniparous or twin livestock. In conclusion, pAPN site\u2010specific edited pigs will assist in the development of TGEV\u2010resistant piglets, serve as an important model for studying tumor formation and development, and aid in the development of treatments for infections caused by coronaviruses.",
