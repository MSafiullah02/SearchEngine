            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped plus-stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and animals and cause a variety of diseases, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurotropic diseases (1). Phylogenetically, CoVs are classified into four genera, alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses, and deltacoronaviruses (2). Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a lineage A betacoronavirus and is commonly used as a model to study CoV entry, replication, and pathogenesis. MHV utilizes murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (mCEACAM1) as a receptor (3, 4). CEACAM1 is an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) member and is involved in various functions, including development, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and innate and adaptive immune responses, etc. (5). There are two alleles of the CEACMA1 gene in mouse populations: mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b. Although they share 75% identity in the N-terminal Ig-like domain where the MHV spike (S) protein binds, only mCEACAM1a is an effective receptor for MHV (4, 6, 7). Several critical contact residues for MHV S protein binding are missing in mCEACAM1b, including the critical isoleucine 41 (I41) and arginine 47 (R47) residues (7).",

            "text": "The entry of CoV is mediated by the interaction between the receptor and the viral S protein. The S protein is a member of the class I viral fusion proteins. Each monomer of the trimeric S protein is about 180 to 200 kDa and composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. Like most other class I viral fusion proteins, S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), while S2 possesses the fusion machinery, including the fusion peptide, two heptad repeats (HRs), the juxtamembrane domain, and the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A) (8\u201312). Cleavage between S1 and S2 is critical for S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion (also called syncytium formation) (13), and an additional cleavage(s) prior to the fusion peptide is required for virus entry (12, 14, 15). S1 can be further divided into two subdomains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Depending on the specific coronavirus, the RBD can be located in either the NTD or CTD (Fig. 1A). While RBDs of all known alphacoronaviruses and most of the known betacoronaviruses are located in the CTD (16\u201322), MHV uses its NTD to bind mCEACAM1a (23). Our previous structural studies on the NTD/mCEACAM1a complex revealed that the MHV NTD folds like human galectins and that 14 residues on the NTD make direct contacts with mCEACAM1a (Fig. 1B). However, the contribution of each individual contacting residue in the NTD to receptor binding and virus entry has not been fully analyzed. In this study, we systematically investigated the role of most contacting residues of NTDs in receptor binding and infection and found that R20, I22, N26, and N172 are critical for receptor binding and virus entry. Surprisingly, we found that G29 was critical for conformational changes of the S protein, although it had no influence on receptor binding.",

To evaluate their individual contributions to the binding of mCEACAM1a, we mutated each of these contact residues in the S protein to alanine or the corresponding residues (R20K and G29D) in the S protein of bovine CoV based on the alignment, except for phenylalanine 19 (F19). We first determined if any of the mutations had any effect on S protein expression and processing. The plasmids carrying individual mutant S genes were transfected into HEK293T cells, and their expression was analyzed by Western blotting. In agreement with our previous reports (12), there are two major species of S proteins detected by Western blotting using polyclonal goat anti-MHV S antibody AO4, the full-length S protein of around 180 kDa and a cleaved S protein of around 90 kDa (Fig. 1C). All of the mutant S proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells at levels similar to those of the wild type (WT), indicating that none of the mutations affected S protein expression and processing. We then investigated if any of the mutations had any effect on the transport of the S protein to the cell surface. HEK293T cells transiently expressing either WT or mutant MHV S protein were incubated with AO4 antibodies on ice and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1D, all mutant S proteins were present on the cell surface at a level similar to the WT.",

As shown in Fig. 2, replacement of I22 with alanine had no effect on S protein incorporation into pseudovirions but reduced S protein-mediated virus entry by more than 99%, indicating that I22 is essential for virus entry, in agreement with our previous report (24). The R20A, N26A, and Q159A mutants also had WT levels of S proteins in pseudovirions but markedly reduced virus entry, suggesting that R20, N26, and Q159 are also important for virus entry. The G29D substitution reduced S protein incorporation into pseudovirions, likely contributing to its reduction in virus entry. All of other mutants, including Y15A, L89A, and L160A, gave virus entry and S protein incorporation into pseudovirions at levels similar to those of the WT (Fig. 2B).",

            "text": "I41 in mCEACAM1a is located in the middle of the essential CC\u2032 loop and has been proposed to be an essential residue for receptor activity (25). In the NTD/mCEACAM1a complex structure, I41 of the receptor makes contact with Y15, L89, and L160 of the S protein, as part of the first hydrophobic patch interactions. However, as shown in Fig. 2B and Fig. 3A, none of the Y15A, L89A, and L160A mutants showed any significant reductions of binding to the receptor and virus entry, raising questions about their role in receptor binding and virus entry. Since a hydrophobic interaction tends to have redundancy, we then investigated whether double or triple mutations in these positions of the S protein influenced receptor binding and virus entry. All of the double or triple mutants as well as the wild type were expressed and incorporated into pseudotype virions efficiently (Fig. 3B). While Y15A/L89A and L89/L160A bound to the receptor at levels similar to those of the WT S protein, Y15A/L160A greatly reduced receptor binding by over 65% (Fig. 3A), compared to the WT, indicating that interactions between I41 of the receptor and Y15 and L160 of the S protein are important for virus binding. Surprisingly, the Y15A/L160A double mutant entered 293/mCEACAM1a cells as efficiently as the WT (Fig. 3A). As a recent study on virus entry mediated by the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) S protein revealed that the abundance of the receptor on the cell surface might influence the outcomes of virus entry and receptor binding (26), we reasoned that the presence of high levels of receptors on the 293/mCEACAM1a surface might cause the discrepancy between receptor binding and virus entry. Mouse 17Cl.1 cells are commonly used to grow MHVs and have a relatively lower level of mCEACAM1a on the cell surface than our 293/mCEACAM1a cells (data not shown). We then evaluated virus entry of the Y15A/L160A double mutant in 17Cl.1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, the Y15A/L160A mutant S protein mediated virus entry at only about 10% of the WT level.",

As shown in Fig. 4A, while treatment of HEK293T cells transiently expressing the WT S protein at pH 6.5 induced levels only slightly above the background level of RIS, large RIS were formed when WT S-expressing cells were incubated at pH 8.0, in agreement with our previous report (27).

A significant amount of the S1 subunit was also detected in the supernatant of cells expressing the G29D mutant (Fig. 4B), indicating that the replacement of G29 with aspartic acid triggered spontaneous conformational changes of S proteins and caused the displacement of S1 subunits from S proteins.",

None of these mutations had a significant effect on MHV S protein expression, processing, and transportation to the cell surface of HEK293T cells (Fig. 5A and B). Next, we determined if any mutations affected soluble receptor binding to the S protein. HEK293T cells transiently expressing mutant S proteins were incubated with the soluble receptor and analyzed by flow cytometry. Although all G29 mutants showed WT levels of receptor binding regarding the percentage of positive cells (Fig. 5C), the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of positive cells for all G29 mutants, except for G29P, was lower than that of the WT (Fig. 5D), especially for G29D and G29T. The lower MFI likely resulted from different amounts of S1 shedding from HEK293T cells among different G29 mutants (Fig. 5A, bottom). Since S1 shedding tends to correlate with RIS formation, we then determined if any mutation affected high-pH-triggered RIS. All mutant S proteins except for the G29P mutant had a significant enhancement of high-pH-triggered RIS (Fig. 6), showing a strong correlation with the S1 shedding results. Among all G29 mutants, G29D and G29T shed the largest amount of S1 into the medium and gave pH-independent RIS. In contrast, G29P shed a minimal amount of S1 and gave only a background level of RIS, even at pH 8.0, indicating that the G29P substitution might introduce structural restraints and prevent the conformational changes of the S protein triggered by high pH.",

All G29 mutants showed a significant reduction in virus entry to different extents (Fig. 7A). However, G29D, G29F, G29K, G29M, and G29T had significantly smaller amounts of S proteins in pseudovirions (Fig. 7B) than the WT, which might partially contribute to the reduction in virus entry. G29A also showed slightly less S protein incorporation into pseudovirions. Interestingly, although G29P had almost WT levels of S protein incorporation in pseudovirions (Fig. 7B), their transduction efficiencies were significantly decreased. The G29P mutation reduced transduction by more than 85%, supporting the notion that the G29P mutation might hinder the conformational changes of S proteins triggered by receptor binding. To further evaluate whether G29P had any defect in conformational changes triggered by receptor binding, we performed limited trypsin digestion analysis on S proteins. Purified pseudovirions with MHV S proteins were incubated with the soluble receptor at 37\u00b0C and treated with limited trypsin digestion on ice. Consistent with our previous report (27), upon limited trypsin digestion, several new bands were generated in WT S proteins triggered by receptor binding at 37\u00b0C, including a new \u223c60-kDa band without boiling and dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment (Fig. 7C, left, lane 3) and several bands (25 kDa, 65 kDa, and 120 kDa, etc.) in the boiled and DTT-treated sample (Fig. 7C, right, lane 3), when detected with polyclonal goat anti-MHV S AO4 antibody. In contrast, there was no significant change in the overall pattern of G29P mutant S proteins (Fig. 7C, left, lane 6, and right, lane 6) upon receptor binding and limited trypsin digestion, compared to the controls, indicating that there was a lack of major conformational changes in G29P mutant S proteins when triggered by receptor binding.",

Interestingly, G29 is conserved among only some MHV strains, including MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, MHV-1, and MHV-4 but not in MHV-2 and MHV-3 (Fig. 8B). In MHV-2 and -3, residues at positions 28 and 30 of the S protein also differ from those in other MHV strains but are conserved between them (Fig. 8B). In the NTD structure, the side chains of N28 and A30 are very close, about 3.4 \u00c5 apart (Fig. 8A). We hypothesized that D28 and S30 of the MHV-2 and MHV-3 S proteins might form hydrogen bonds between them to stabilize the structural turn required for the S proteins of MHV-2 and MHV-3. We then constructed two mutants in the background of the S protein of MHV-A59 with the corresponding residues 28 to 30 of the S protein of MHV-2, the N28D/G29T double mutant and the N28D/G29T/A30S triple mutant. We reasoned that the N28D/G29T/A30S triple mutant might be more stable than the N28D/G29T double mutant because of potential extra hydrogen bonding between N28D and A30S. As shown in Fig. 8, theN28D/G29T/A30S triple mutant was expressed at a level similar to that of the WT S protein (Fig. 8C), shed amounts of S1 into the supernatant similar to those shed by the WT (Fig. 8D), and induced slightly more RIS at pH 6.5 and 8.0 (Fig. 8E). In contrast, the N28D/G29T double mutant shed significantly more S1 into the supernatant and induced markedly higher levels of RIS at both pH 6.5 and 8.0 (Fig. 8D and E), consistent with the idea that the absence of hydrogen bonding between D28 and A30 in the N28D/G29T double mutant might destabilize the S protein. The N28D/G29T/A30S triple mutant S proteins were incorporated into pseudovirions slightly less than the WT (Fig. 8F) and mediated virus entry at a level similar to that of the WT (Fig. 8G).",

Recently, series of structures of S proteins of various coronaviruses from multiple genera in different conformational states, such as those without receptor binding (30\u201335), those with a receptor complex (18, 24, 36\u201339), and those in a postfusion conformation (40, 41), have been reported. Surprisingly, structural alignment between the native trimeric MHV S protein and the MHV NTD/mCEACAM1a complex reveals that there is an absence of major conformational changes in the MHV NTD upon receptor binding (Fig. 8A). It is worth noting that receptor binding-induced conformational changes in the MHV NTD might be too transient to be captured by structure studies, or the MHV NTD/mCEACAM1a complex could not go through any conformational changes, simply because complex crystallization was performed at 4\u00b0C and not at 37\u00b0C.",

            "text": "Does binding to mCEACAM1a trigger any conformational change in the MHV NTD? If so, how? There are 14 residues in the MHV NTD interacting with mCEACAM1a, and most of them are located on the N terminus of the MHV S protein and form a loop and a \u03b21-sheet (24). Among them, I22 is essential for receptor binding and virus entry, in agreement with our previous report (24). Unexpectedly, we found that G29 might play important roles in conformational changes of the S protein triggered by either receptor binding or high pH. G29 is located on the top of the trimeric S protein, close to the end of the \u03b21-sheet, and at the center of a turn (Fig. 8A). Replacement of G29 with either aspartic acid or threonine might alter the local conformation in the NTD by extending the \u03b21-sheet and disrupting the turn and may lead to conformational changes of the NTD, resulting in the spontaneous dissociation of S1 subunits from the S protein and the formation of pH- and receptor-independent syncytia. G29A, G29F, G29K, and G29M mutations might also change the local conformation to lower degrees and showed a significant enhancement of high-pH-triggered RIS (Fig. 6). In contrast, the G29P substitution had no effect on S protein processing, receptor binding, and S protein incorporation into pseudovirions (Fig. 5 and 7), suggesting that its overall conformation prior to receptor binding is very similar to that of the WT S protein. Glycine and proline are two residues that are often found in \u03b2-turns. However, while glycine has no side chain and is the most sterically flexible residue, proline has the cyclic side chain and is the most conformationally restricted amino acid residue. We reason that the inherent rigid property of proline to maintain the turn in the G29P mutant might hinder the conformational change of the S protein from receptor binding, resulting in a >85% reduction in the transduction efficiency. This notion was further supported by our limited trypsin digestion results, where binding of the G29P S protein to the soluble receptor induced only minimal conformational changes of the S protein (Fig. 7C). Since G29 is also at the NTD/mCEACAM1a interaction interface, we propose that G29 might be one of the residues critical for the early initiation of receptor binding-induced conformational changes of the S protein in the MHV-A59 strain. The G29P mutant also showed a significant defect in high-pH-triggered receptor-independent syncytium formation, indicating that the proline substitution likely stabilizes the overall conformation of the S protein.",

D28 and S30 in MHV-2 and MHV-3 likely form hydrogen bonds to facilitate structural turn formation around residue 29 to stabilize the prefusion conformation of the MHV S protein. Disrupting this interaction results in the spontaneous dissociation of the S1 subunit from the S protein and pH-independent RIS.

            "text": "In the cocrystal structure of the MHV S NTD/mCEACAM1a complex, there are two hydrophobic patches essential for the interaction of the NTD and mCEACAM1a (24). The first hydrophobic patch includes interactions of I41 of mCEACAM1a with Y15, L89, and L160 of MHV S, while the second hydrophobic patch is composed of interactions of V49, M54, and F56 of mCEACAM1a with I22 and Y162 of the MHV NTD. I41 of mCEACAM1a is essential for virus entry (25). Surprisingly, mutating all three I41-interacting residues, Y15, L89, and L160, to alanine reduced the binding of the S protein to mCEACAM1a by only 43% and had almost no effect on S-mediated virus entry, consistent with the idea that hydrophobic interactions tend to have redundancy. The difference observed between binding affinity and virus entry likely results from the inherent difference between the two assays. The virus binding assay was performed at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, at which membrane fusion could not occur, whereas the virus entry assay was done at 37\u00b0C overnight, at which membrane fusion could occur. Since membrane fusion is irreversible, it might drive weak binding for successful virus entry when large amounts of receptors are present and when it is given enough time. Similar phenomena have been observed for other coronaviruses (17, 26, 42) and other enveloped viruses (43, 44). In the second hydrophobic patch, I22 of the NTD seems to be essential. The replacement of I22 with alanine dramatically decreased virus binding (Fig. 1) and almost abolished virus entry (Fig. 2). There are two residues in mCEACAM1a interacting with I22 of the S protein, M54 and F56, where replacement of M54 with lysine or F56 with threonine in mCEACAM1a significantly decreased virus entry (7), indicating that interactions between I22 of the S protein and M54 and F56 of mCEACAM1a are critical for virus entry. I22 of the NTD and I41 of mCEACAM1a are like two hydrophobic anchors. They do not interact with each other, but they anchor the interaction between the S protein and mCEACAM1a. Removal of either \u201canchor\u201d is detrimental to receptor binding and virus entry, but modification of the \u201canchoring place\u201d is less influential on viral infection.",

Some CoVs, such as MERS-CoV, use their CTDs to bind protein receptors and NTDs to bind sugar moieties (45, 46). One intriguing question is whether there is any cross-domain communication between the NTD and CTD during conformational changes of the S protein leading to virus entry. The G29P mutation stabilizes the MHV-A59 S protein (Fig. 5A) and hinders the conformational changes of the S protein initiated from the NTD (Fig. 7) but has almost no effect on pH- and receptor-independent syncytium formation initiated by a CTD mutation, Y320A, indicating that there might be minimal cross-domain communication between the NTD and CTD during conformational changes of the S protein, at least in MHV-A59.",
