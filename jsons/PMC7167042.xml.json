            "text": "Concerns about the environmental effects of anthropogenic climate change are motivating considerable effort to model and predict the impact of global warming on regional ecosystems. This is particularly true for the high\u2010mountain regions of tropical Africa, where climate change is expected to result in complete loss of ice caps and glaciers. On Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), the ice cap covering its western (Kibo) top has shrunk by 80% in the last century; at this rate, all \u2018eternal\u2019 snow will disappear within two decades (Thompson et al., 2002). Glaciers on Mount Kenya (Kenya) have shrunk by 40% since 1963 (Hastenrath, 1995). Likewise, in the Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo) the ice field of Elena Glacier is thinning, and its front has retreated several hundreds of metres in the last 50 years (Kaser & Osmaston, 2002; M\u00f6lg et al., 2003). This rapid retreat is consistent with warming of the tropical middle troposphere in recent decades (Hastenrath & Kruss, 1992; Gaffen et al., 2000), though a longer\u2010time decrease of precipitation and air humidity may be the principal cause of the near\u2010continuous retreat of the African glaciers since 1850 (Hastenrath, 2001; Kaser et al., 2004). Clearly, loss of permanent ice from the tops of Africa's highest mountains will have profound effects on the hydrology and temperature regime of alpine lakes located downstream from those glaciers. This by itself may have a severe impact on the integrity and function of these scarce Afroalpine aquatic ecosystems, and add to the direct effects of a regional rise in air temperature. Consequently, there is an urgent need to characterize the aquatic fauna and flora of these (still relatively) undamaged Afroalpine lakes, to determine their uniqueness in relation to both African lowland lakes and alpine lakes in temperate regions, and to find adequate means to monitor future changes in their biological diversity.",

            "text": "Chironomid larvae (Insecta: Diptera, non\u2010biting midges) are a dominant component of bottom\u2010dwelling invertebrate communities in lakes and streams around the world (Armitage et al., 1995). Previous surveys of the chironomid fauna of African highland regions have mainly focused on flowing waters in the montane forest zone, e.g. mountain streams and rivers in Ethiopia (Harrison & Hynes, 1988; Harrison, 1991, 1992, 1996), Democratic Republic of the Congo (Lehmann, 1979, 1981), South Africa (Scott, 1958; Harrison & Agnew, 1962; Harrison, 2000a, 2000b) and north\u2010eastern Tanzania (S\u00e6ther & Wang, 1992; Andersen & S\u00e6ther, 1993, 1994a, 1994b; S\u00e6ther & Andersen, 1993, 1995, 1996; S\u00e6ther, 1996; Stur & Ekrem, 2000). With the exception of a few streams at 2850\u20133500 m a.s.l. (above sea level) in Ethiopia (Harrison, 1991, 1992, 1996), most chironomid habitats studied so far are actually cool forest streams at modest elevations of c. 1400\u20132400 m. Standing waters within this altitude range in tropical Africa are still quite warm (surface temperatures of 18\u201326\u00b0C), and their chironomid fauna is similar to that of low\u2010elevation lakes (Eggermont & Verschuren, 2004a, 2004b). Little information is available on the chironomid fauna in Africa's true high\u2010mountain lakes, which occur above the tree line within the Afroalpine zone of the few sizeable mountain massifs higher than 3000 m. Their unique, perennially cold tropical standing\u2010water habitat (L\u00f6ffler, 1964) may well be reflected in a distinct and vulnerable aquatic fauna.",

This paper presents diagnoses, illustrations and biogeographical notes for all encountered taxa, followed by an evaluation of species diversity compared to other groups of aquatic biota in these lakes, and of the uniqueness of this Afroalpine chironomid fauna compared with that of African lakes at low and middle elevations. Instead of studying collections of the living larval communities, we examined their remains preserved in recently deposited lake sediments. In the small lakes considered here, recent death assemblages yield a spatially and seasonally integrated picture of present\u2010day species diversity (Frey 1988), which would otherwise require intensive live collecting that in these remote locations is challenging to realize.",

The original mountain cone was possibly over 6000 m high, but glacial erosion during the Quaternary has worn away the top part and left in its place a jagged topography with U\u2010shaped glacial valleys and cirque basins. Between 3500 and 4700 m a.s.l. these contain about 20 small glacier\u2010fed lakes and isolated tarns. Lower down on the mountain several volcanic crater lakes occur; the highest of these is Rutundu at 3080 m a.s.l. Above the present\u2010day snowline at 4500 m there are 12 remnant glaciers on Mount Kenya, which are all receding and thinning rapidly. The mountain climate is characterized by large diurnal temperature oscillations and small seasonal variation, heavy long rains in March\u2013June, and short rains in October\u2013November.",

These six lakes vary in surface\u2010water conductivity from 8.8 to 61 \u03bcS cm\u22121, pH from 6.1 to 8.9 and water depth from 0.6 to 10.1 m (Table 1). For comparison we also analysed sediment samples from two lakes on the lower slopes of Mount Kenya, i.e. in the Cultivation and Basal plateau belt (c. 1600\u20132000 m, dominated by grasses and agricultural crops: Rurie Swamp and Lake Nkunga). Their surface\u2010water conductivities are 82.9 and 316 \u03bcS cm\u22121, respectively, their pH is 7.3 and 6.7, and they are 1.0 and 1.6 m deep.",

            "text": "The Rwenzori Mountains are a group of six glaciated massifs stretching from Lake Edward to Lake Albert on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Fig. 1). The high massifs (reaching between 4626 and 5109 m a.s.l.) are all topped with glaciers, and dissected by deep glacier\u2010eroded valleys. Vegetation distribution is largely similar to that on Mount Kenya with some difference in altitudinal extent of the vegetation belts, and in the plant species present (Hedberg, 1951). The Rwenzori mountains are wetter than Mount Kenya because of heavier and more regular rainfall, with main rainy periods from mid\u2010March to May, and from September to mid\u2010December. An estimated 30 glacier\u2010fed lakes and tarns occur on the Ugandan side, and another 10 or so on the Democratic Republic of the Congo side of the range. We studied samples (authors\u2019 own collection, July 2002) from five highly dilute lakes (surface\u2010water conductivity between 6 and 26 \u03bcS cm\u22121) situated in the Alpine zone (Bujuku, Lower Kitandara, Upper Kitandara and Josephat's Pool; with mosses, giant heather, lobelias and groundsels around the lakes) and the Nival zone (Green Pool; an isolated permanent pool surrounded by rocks with lichens, no real vegetation), spanning elevations between 3909 and 4341 m. Due to logistic constraints at the time of sampling, data on lake depth and temperature are currently not available for these Rwenzori lakes; their pH ranges between 6.1 and 7.8 (Table 1). In contrast to the study sites on Mount Kenya, where bottom\u2010sediment samples were collected from a boat, larval chironomid communities in the Rwenzori lakes were studied using bottom sediments collected nearshore. We cannot assume that these present a fully integrated picture of faunal diversity in these lakes (Frey, 1988). However, cold polymixis (frequent mixing) and lack of submerged littoral vegetation (L\u00f6ffler, 1964) creates similar well\u2010oxygenated bottom habitat in both deepwater and nearshore environments. Consequently, recently deposited chironomid death assemblages are probably fairly homogeneous lake\u2010wide.",

Differences in diagnostic characters between these taxa resemble differences at the species level in live material from the Holarctic region, so we regard most of our fossil morphotypes to be equivalent to morphospecies. Morphological terminology follows S\u00e6ther (1980), supplemented by Kowalyk (1985), Rieradevall & Brooks (2001) and Webb & Scholl (1985) for the relevant taxa. Species attribution of the subfossil morphotypes follows criteria set out by Eggermont & Verschuren (2003a), using both morphological and biogeographical considerations. Specimens were attributed to a known morphotype when the minimum set of required diagnostic characters were recorded at least once per site. Morphotypes bearing no explicit resemblance with known African or Holarctic species and larval types are designated by their genus or tribe name followed by the name of the lake in which the most complete specimen was found, e.g. \u2018Larsia type Kitandara\u2019.

All four African Limnophyes species belong to the L. minimus group as defined by Epler (2001), but their larvae cannot reliably be separated without associated adults (S\u00e6ther, 1990; Epler, 2001). This morphotype matches larval L. minimus described from the Kerguelen Islands (S\u00e6ther, 1990), but also L. natalensis (S\u00e6ther, 1990; Eggermont & Verschuren, 2004a). Given the possible occurrence of all four African Limnophyes species in the study area, we attribute this morphotype to the species group.

It differs from larvae of the related Dicrotendipes septemmaculatus (Becker) mainly in having ventromental plates with more striae (c. 40\u201346 rather than c. 26\u201332), and a frontal apotome with smooth anterior margin, not displaying the irregular tubercles present in D. septemmaculatus (Contreras\u2010Lichtenberg, 1988; Epler, 1988; Harrison, 1993). Records of D. pilosimanus are restricted to South Africa and cool montane streams and ponds in East Africa (Harrison, 1993, 2000a), whereas D. septemmaculatus seems to occur in warm low\u2010 and mid\u2010elevation lakes throughout East and North Africa (Freeman, 1957; Epler, 1988). Also Dicrotendipes collarti (Goetghebuer) has been reported from the East African mountains (Nyandarua Range in Kenya; Freeman, 1957), but its larva is unknown. We found D. pilosimanus only on Mount Kenya, at all elevations (seven lakes between 1320 and 4575 m a.s.l.) but most abundantly in lakes below tree line. As its frontal apotome is not always preserved and the ventromental striae often difficult to count, we are aware that our material may include some D. septemmaculatus, especially in the mid\u2010elevation lakes Nkunga and Rurie Swamp. Lake Nkunga Dicrotendipes include at least three true D. pilosimanus specimens, but some others are more likely to belong to D. septemmaculatus. Also some incomplete Dicrotendipes from mid\u2010elevation Kenya lakes such as Ol Bolossat (c. 2358 m a.s.l.) and Narasha (c. 2764 m a.s.l.) which Eggermont & Verschuren (2004b) assigned to D. septemmaculatus may actually be D. pilosimanus, yet none of the several 100 Dicrotendipes specimens recovered from these and other lakes could be unambiguously assigned to it.",

The eight group (1) taxa were absent both in lakes below 3900 m (1320\u20133500 m) surveyed here and from any of 68 East African lakes at low and intermediate altitude (750\u20132760 m) surveyed earlier (Eggermont & Verschuren, 2004a, 2004b); consequently they must be cold\u2010stenothermal species which are adapted to, and require, the harsh climatic conditions prevailing at the top of Africa's highest mountains. Night\u2010time freezing can occur from c. 3000 m a.s.l. (i.e. the present\u2010day tree line between Bamboo forest and the Ericaceous zone), but at 4000 m (transition between Ericaceous zone and Alpine zone) nocturnal frosts occur on 80\u201390% of the nights and almost throughout the year (Rundel, 1994). The equatorial position of these mountain ranges creates daily oscillations in air temperature between \u22125 and 20\u00b0C in the Alpine and Nival zones, an order of magnitude greater than the seasonal change in maximum daytime temperature. In the deeper lakes, night\u2010time water\u2010surface cooling and convection creates bottom temperatures approaching 4\u00b0C, as in seasonally stratified lakes in cold\u2010temperate regions. Shallow lakes often freeze over at night, and with the exception of the shallowest tarns, daytime warming heats up surface waters to, at most, 8\u201310\u00b0C (Table 1). As almost all life processes in holometabolous insects (egg survival and hatching rate, larval growth and feeding, pupation, emergence, flight and fecundity) are under temperature control (Pinder, 1995), African Chironomidae whose larvae are restricted to these alpine lakes and tarns must evidently be cold\u2010stenothermal.",

The Diamesinae in particular are a characteristic component of alpine chironomid faunas in the Holarctic region (North America and Eurasia).

Among the eight cold\u2010stenothermous taxa encountered only Chaetocladius melaleucus, Paratrichocladius type Hausburg Tarn and Paratrichocladius type Simba Tarn were found both on Mount Kenya and in the Rwenzori, but with only c. 15% of potential habitat on the two mountains sampled, this small proportion of shared species is not likely to be a true reflection of the shared fauna. Afrotropical Diamesa do show species differentiation between mountains (D. kenyae and D. freemani on Mount Kenya, D. rwenzoriensis in the Rwenzori; Diamesa has not yet been recorded on Mount Kilimanjaro: Freeman, 1955; Willassen & Cranston, 1986), but with the caveat that distribution records for the adult midges are as fragmentary as they are for larvae.",

Willassen & Cranston (1986) suggested a more or less continuous dispersal route for alpine aquatic biota between the East African mountains and Eurasia during the mid\u2010Tertiary period. This route would have stretched from the Caucasus through the Near East to the Ethiopian highlands, and allowed colonization of East Africa by strictly cold\u2010stenothermal taxa. Prominent among these are Diamesa and African montane Orthocladiinae such as Chaetocladius melaleucus (Meigen) that are considered to have a Palaearctic or Nearctic origin (Willassen & Cranston, 1986). Limnophyes minimus (Meigen) and L. natalensis (Kieffer), here combined into Epler's (2001)\nLimnophyes minimus group, are both widely distributed throughout Europe and North America, and even occur on some sub\u2010Antarctic islands (S\u00e6ther, 1990). African Chironominae with montane distribution patterns are proposed to have used the same route but in either direction (Harrison & Hynes, 1988).

First, the Oligocene period of world\u2010wide cooling [34\u201326 million years ago (Ma)], which is supposed to have created a stepping\u2010stone corridor of cold mountain environments from Eurasia to East Africa, was most probably still as warm or warmer than today (Zachos et al., 2001), and was followed by 12 Myr of late Oligocene and Miocene warming (26\u201314 Ma), at which time no glaciers can have existed at tropical latitudes. Second, although Eocene volcanic activity in the incipient East African Rift System (c. 45\u201333 Ma) extruded sequences of flood basalt up to 2.5 km thick in present\u2010day Ethiopia, northern Kenya and southern Arabia (Ebinger et al., 2000; Tiercelin & Lezzar, 2002), there is no evidence for temporal continuity of high\u2010mountain environments in East Africa between this period of early rifting in the north, and the main uplift of the Aberdares in the late Miocene, the Rwenzori in the Pliocene or the formation of Mount Kenya c. 3 Ma (Barker et al., 1988; Pickford et al., 1993; Ebinger et al., 2000).",

During this period, global cooling relative to the Present has been the rule rather than the exception: interglacial climate conditions similar to those of the current Holocene epoch prevailed during c. 20% of the time (EPICA, 2004). Therefore, faunal exchange between Africa's high\u2010mountain environments and Eurasia has almost certainly been most prominent not during the mid Tertiary but during late Quaternary glacial episodes, and as recently as 15,000\u201320,000 years ago. It is commonly assumed that Afroalpine ecosystems persisted continuously since the late Pliocene (Axelrod & Raven, 1978; Harmsen et al., 1991), but probably not much longer. The oldest concrete evidence for mountain glaciation in equatorial East Africa is in fact decidedly younger: c. 480,000 years on Mount Kilimanjaro (Downie, 1964), c. 400,000 years on Mount Kenya (Shanahan & Zreda, 2000) and >300,000 years in the Rwenzori (Osmaston & Kaser, 2001).",

At that time, mean annual temperature in mountainous regions was reduced by 5\u20136\u00b0C (Porter, 2001), and snowlines were depressed by 570\u20131000 m (Kaser & Osmaston, 2002). Vegetation belts shifted downslope and contracted, extending the Afroalpine zone to c. 3200 m a.s.l. (Mahaney, 1989). The seven current Afroalpine enclaves in equatorial East Africa must have increased somewhat in size (Harmsen et al., 1991) but not substantially so, and only very few new enclaves with probable Afroalpine abiotic conditions were formed in the Cherangani Hills of northern Kenya, the Ngorongoro area west of Mount Meru, and the Mitumba Range of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Only when including the entire faunal transition zone (Fig. 6), of which the lower boundary may have extended to c. 2200 m, can it be proposed that cold\u2010stenothermal African Chironomidae potentially enjoyed significantly more widespread distributions and increased dispersal between individual mountain systems during Quaternary glaciation periods. Broad swaths of highlands at that elevation lie both among the eastern (Mount Elgon, Mount Kenya, Nyandarua, Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Meru) and western (Rwenzori, Virunga) equatorial mountains, and among the three Ethiopian massifs, and substantial new stepping stones between these three mountain regions may have occurred in the Uganda\u2013Sudan border region.

Initial demonstration, from surface\u2010sediment larval death assemblages, of strong altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in chironomid species distribution (Walker & Mathewes, 1989; Walker & MacDonald, 1995) resulted in the development of chironomid\u2010based quantitative inference models for reconstruction of past variations of air and water temperature in both North America and Europe (Lotter et al., 1997; Walker et al., 1997; Larocque et al., 2001). Reconstruction of Africa's climate history from natural climate archives such as lake sediments will be essential to amend the current scarcity of information on natural tropical climate variability and help forecast the fate of Afrotropical ecosystems over the next centuries. Given the difficulty of separating the effects of changes in temperature and moisture balance on geochemical records of African climate change (Gasse, 2002), an independent and reliable proxy indicator for past temperature change in Africa would be most welcome (Verschuren, 2003). Documentation in this study of the distinct character of chironomid communities inhabiting Africa's true cold\u2010water lakes is a first step towards chironomid\u2010based reconstruction of past temperature change in Africa, and improved understanding of past and future tropical climate dynamics.",
