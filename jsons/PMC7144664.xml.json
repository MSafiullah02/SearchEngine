It is rather obvious that, waiting for efficient vaccines, antiviral drugs and, eventually, herd immunity, any attempt to fight against the deadly virus needs to be performed. Available tools of structural and computational Biology are particularly suited to obtain predictions for new therapeutic strategies through fast and safe procedures if we have a reliable structural basis. The fact that the quaternary structure of COVID-19 spike (S) glycoprotein has been resolved [1] and is now freely downloadable from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) opens to Structural Biology new perspectives to stop the viral infection. The S glycoprotein, indeed, is central for COVID-19 infection as it mediates attachment of virions to the host cell receptor, it is involved in cell-to-cell fusion and induces neutralizing antibodies, bearing also virulence determinants [2].",

On March 28 of the current year, NCBI GenBank [12] reported 99 S glycoprotein sequences for COVID-19. One of these sequences, YP_009724390.1, and one representative of TGEV, AAY22404.1, were aligned by using Clustal Omega [13]. In the latter alignment the S glycoprotein S2 domain, the most critical region to stabilize the trimeric form of the S glycoprotein, showed 81% sequence similarity, ensuring the reliability of our initial assumption.",

Before analyzing the complex pattern of S glycoprotein trimerization, we have depleted the PDB structure from all heteroatoms to simplify our atom depth calculations. Thus, from a molecular visualization accounting for individual atom depth [5], in each of the three S glycoprotein protomers, we could easily identify many surface pockets, see Fig. 1\n. It is apparent that the surface of S glycoprotein protomer A, in the PDB nomenclature, has plenty of deep concave regions. Afterward, we have carried out a quantitative analysis on each of the three surfaces of S glycoprotein protomers by using EPOSBP software [8] finding 143 pockets with volumes ranging from 190 to 850 \u00c53. Then, we have characterized the amino acid content of the three protomer-protomer interfaces by using the EBI PISA tool [7]. Overlapping of EPOSBP surface pockets with PISA defined interfaces yielded initial clues of COVID-19 S glycoprotein moieties that could be the target of our study. All the pockets located at protomer-protomer interfaces were screened for druggability according to PockDrug-Server [14].",

All residues belonging to COVID-19 S glycoprotein S2 domain, encompassing 660\u20131273 sequence fragment, exhibited full identity, indicating the fundamental role of this glycoprotein moiety for quaternary structure stability, see Supplementary Material. This finding also suggests that COVID-19 evolution should not influence possible ligand binding to the pockets that we have delineated. We extended our sequence conservation analysis on S glycoprotein not only for COVID-19, but also for similar coronaviruses by using BLAST software [15] and multiple alignment Cobalt tool [16]. As reported in Supplementary Material, alignment of 160 S glycoprotein sequences from NCBI GenBank for a large variety of bat and SARS coronaviruses shows full conservation, apart from Pro792 and Ile882, for all the residues that form pockets reported in Table 1. The latter result adds additional value to the therapeutic use of ligands whose binding to COVID-19 S glycoprotein may interfere with its quaternary structure assembly.",

This task was achieved by downloading the content of DrugBank 5.1,5 [10] to obtain two distinct data sets of possible COVID-19 ligands, i.e. one set containing 108 nutraceutical drugs and the other set containing 1223 FDA-approved small molecule drugs. Afterward, we carried out a docking simulation between all the small molecules of the two data sets and pockets #1 and #6, among all the ones that are listed in Table 1, for the sake of computing time. By using Autodock VinaXB [9] we have analyzed all the steric and energetic features characterizing the interactions of small molecules in our two data sets. By restricting the docking simulation only to the protomer surface regions where pocket #1 and #6 are located, we obtained a large array of possible ligands. Based on their calculated free energy of interaction, we have selected, and listed in Table 3\n, eight of the best candidates for further experimental investigations.",
