            "text": "The SCCM formed the Discovery, the Critical Care Research Network, in 2016 to provide a central resource to link critical care clinical investigators to scale up research in critical illness and injury, providing both centralized networking and tangible resources including data storage and management, statistical support, grant writing assistance, and other project management needs. Remarkably, the social media platform Twitter (4) played a role in bringing together the VIRUS Discovery Consortium\u2014quickly linking a group of critical care clinician-investigators (A.J.W., O.G., R.K.), statisticians (M.O.H.), pharmacists (S.B.), researchers (V.B.), and SCCM staff (V.K.K.) with a strong interest in quickly establishing the multicenter, international SCCM COVID-19 VIRUS registry. Dissemination of information regarding the registry occurred via the SCCM website (5); daily Twitter posts advertising the importance, availability, and purpose of the registry; and word of mouth. Within 14 days of the initial Twitter post bringing together the VIRUS Leadership Team, the Consortium ~250 sites across North America, South America, East, South, and Western Asia, Africa, and Europe had submitted institutional review board (IRB) applications for participation in the registry (Fig. 1); Table 1 shows the number of sites reaching different landmarks to study participation during the first 2 weeks after a call for sites was announced. By week 2 after announcing the formation of the registry, data from more than 100 cases had been uploaded. The rapid enrollment of sites in the absence of external funding or support for the project is indicative of nearly universal enthusiasm across the international critical care community to collaborate across borders and silos in order to quickly learn from accumulating experience with COVID-19.",

The de-identified, HIPAA compliant database was developed to capture both core data collection fields containing clinical information collected for all patients, and an enhanced data set of daily physiologic, laboratory, and treatment information collected by sites with available research support and/or infrastructure to allow for more intensive data collection (see data overview in Fig. 2, and detailed Case Report Forms in Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCX/A163). The case report forms were adapted from the World Health Organization templates data collection forms (6), with edits to focus on an ICU-specific context. Case report forms went through rapid iterative editing to balance feasibility, efficiency, and comprehensiveness, with input from multiple clinical specialties.",

The SCCM VIRUS Discovery Network will have a four pillar open science approach to data reporting and sharing. First, all centers have open access to their data for internal quality assurance and pilot studies. Second, summary count data will be displayed on the SCCM VIRUS website (https://www.sccm.org/Research/Research/Discovery-Research-Network/VIRUS-COVID-19-Registry) as an interactive dashboard that will provide public reporting of real-time updates with regards to case counts, ICU resource use, and outcomes. Third, with appropriate data use agreements, investigators will be able apply to use the pooled multicenter data for independent research questions. Fourth, the SCCM COVID-19 research team will identify urgent questions of clinical effectiveness, submit study protocols for independent methodological peer review, and design rigorous observational causal inference approaches (e.g., appropriate missing data methods, target trial emulation, use of directed acyclic graphs for covariate selection, quantitative sensitivity analyses [7]) paired with data visualizations that produce real-time results displayed on the Dashboard for immediate dissemination. We seek to facilitate a timely, democratized, and crowd-sourced discovery process, similar to ICU databases such as Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) (8). The SCCM VIRUS Discovery Network will encourage that all research projects using Consortium data post pre-prints in noncommercial archives, further facilitating rapid-reporting of research findings necessary for nimble response to a pandemic.",

Strategies that worked to facilitate rapid progress included a strong social media presence, open communications and data harmonization with other research networks (e.g., National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network), responsive IRBs that identified the critical need for rapid approval of de-identified data collection in the setting of a pandemic, use of the established database infrastructure Research Electronic Data Capture (9) for construction of harmonized case report forms, as well as an academic-professional society partnership that facilitated rapid processing of data use agreements, and early set up of a central website for communication of study materials, frequently asked questions, and standard operating procedures. Early review of literature and comparative research (10) of previous outbreaks was helpful in preparing the research resources; early reports from sentinel countries guided targeting of relevant data fields. In addition, assembly of a multidisciplinary leadership team enabled multiple stakeholder engagement and shared responsibility and mentorship across training levels. Finally, a daily reminder to focus on the goals of the database\u2014ICU practices, physiology, and outcomes for patients with COVID-19\u2014helped to mitigate scope creep and allow for timely completion of the data infrastructure. Strategies that may have improved the process included the use of a central IRB, funding to support local data entry, and a preexisting team able to \u201cflip the switch\u201d on an existing infrastructure to immediately respond to a crisis.",

It is our profound hope that a similar registry will not be required in the future. However, it is likely that we will be applying lessons learned from COVID-19 to future pandemics. Our experience of quickly initiating the SCCM Discovery VIRUS Registry and moving from conception to data accrual within less than a month has taught us several valuable lessons\u2014most important being that clinicians across the world want to donate their time for the greater good. As we continue to accrue data into the SCCM Discovery VIRUS COVID-19 Registry, we anticipate that newly established infrastructure and networks will enable more nimble responses to data collection and discovery that allow us to learn from the past, and be better prepared for future pandemics.",
