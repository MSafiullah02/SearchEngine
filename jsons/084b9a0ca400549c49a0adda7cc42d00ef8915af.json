We describe the concept behind the devices and report a characterization of them. Finally, we make a description of the solved and unsolved challenges and propose a series of measures in order to better cope with future contingencies.",

During the following days, an interdisciplinary group was formed including people with backgrounds in Physics, Engineering, Informatics, Medicine, etc. to shape up ideas. Quickly two approaches were chosen, prototypes started to be built, tested and optimized for performance and reliability. In this contribution we present two ventilator prototypes of the most basic approach which are based on the use of a Bag-Valve manual ventilator.",

            "text": "While the use of mechanical ventilation is a clinical practice that is normally only used on patients that require it as a life-sustaining measure, inappropriate ventilation of a patient could result in damage to the lungs that would also be lifethreatening. [10] [11] [12] The breathing process might seem a relatively simple one at first glance. To first approximation it is not very different to inflating and deflating a balloon, however, that simplistic view is what physicists would call a spherical-cowapproximation. There are a number of subtleties that make respiration more complex. In the following, we provide a brief description of the breathing process based on 13 . Under normal circumstances, inhalation is driven by the unconscious motion of a series of muscles, mainly the diaphragm as the key muscle together with different other muscle groups of the chest wall, that increase the volume of the thoracic cavity. This leads to a decrease of the pressure in the lungs which, at its time, results in the flow of fresh air into the lungs through the airway. The subsequent relaxation of said muscles increases the pressure in the lungs that produces the exhalation. Therefore inhalation is usually produced by \"negative\" thoracic pressure, while exhalation is produced by \"positive\" thoracic pressure. When mechanical ventilation is applied, usually through an endotracheal tube, the inhalation is no longer driven by negative pressure produced by the patient, but by positive pressure provided by the ventilator that \"forces\" air into lungs, this is a complete game-changer in many senses. For instance, natural \"negative\" pressure inspiration can not over inflate the lungs and its internal ramified structures, the alveoli, which can potentially be damaged by overpressure when \"positive\" pressure is applied. This could lead to damage of the lung, which is usually already compromised by the underlying condition, such as pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Therefore, the volume per inspiration (tidal volume) and the appropriate pressures across the breathing cycle must be limited.",

            "text": "Unlike healthy subjects, who maintain a small volume of air in the lungs once the exhalation is over, critical patients in some cases produce a full exhalation, this causes the fluids that are in the lung to completely fill all the cavities, which means that it is more difficult to inflate the lung again in the following breath cycle, and making it more prone to injury by the mechanical ventilation, therefore, a minimal positive pressure (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure; PEEP) should be maintained in the lung at the end of the expiration in order to prevent the collapse of the lungs. It is worth mentioning that bag-valve resuscitators are single-use-products, thus, for each new patient, a new resuscitator is needed. Yet, hygienic standards are easy to follow, as the two mechanism prototypes themselves are not part of the pneumatic system itself. In addition, a connecting hose between the bag-valve system and the mask or endotracheal tube will be needed, which is normally not used in manual resuscitation. The total volume of that hose has to be significantly smaller than the tidal volume pumped in order to ensure appropriate exhaustion of the exhaled CO 2 to the atmosphere.",

            "text": "In addition to the purely pneumatic considerations, there are other aspects to be taken into account. For instance, forcing air into the lungs of a patient at a rate determined by the ventilator instead of the natural rhythm determined by the patient is extremely uncomfortable and requires deep sedation, which might complicate other aspects of the progress evaluation and treatment of the patient. Hence, a feedback mechanism, usually by pressure or flow, is desirable in order to trigger the breath cycle of the ventilator and thus improve the patient-ventilator synchrony. Furthermore the gas used for ventilation should be enriched in oxygen content (FiO 2 ) since the lung capacity of the patient is diminished, and ideally the gas mixture should be humidified and warmed-up since the endotracheal tube bypasses the upper part of the airway (nose & pharynx), which usually performs these two functions.",

The system consists of a motor that drives a small gear, which at its time drives two larger gears coupled to each other in order for them to move synchronously but in opposite directions. The two gears have an additional eccentric axis that is used to move a coupling rod each, which moves an oscillatory arm which is fixed at one end to the baseplate of the mechanical system. A convex piece is attached to the other end of the arm which is used to press the bag-valve at regular intervals. The position of the fixed point of the arm can be varied and this provides the user with control over the tidal volume. The positions are well depicted in Fig. 6 in the methods section. The frequency can be varied as well by changing the voltage supplied to the motor. The ensemble is shown in Fig. 1 . However, the inclusion of a microcontroller opens the possibility of controlling not only the breathing frequency and the volume pumped, but the inspiration/expiration time ratio, pressure limits, and pressure/flow triggers. Measurements of pressure and flow were performed on the CLAPER device in order to quantify its performance and decide if it is within the expected parameters for a mechanical ventilator as described in the Methods section. The measurement results are shown in Fig. 2 . The tests were performed using the different positions of the pivot in order to have some control over the tidal volume pumped which is a parameter that needs to be controlled for its use. Fig. 2(a) shows the time evolution of the pressure along 4 breathing cycles for various positions of the pivot. The points in Fig. 2(b) show the peak pressure achieved for the different pivot positions, showing that peak pressures between 8.9 and 25.9 cm H 2 O were achieved. Fig. 2(c) shows the evolution of the flow for the breathing cycle and the peak inspiratory and expiratory flows are shown in panel (d). From those measurements it is possible to obtain the evolution of the volume pumped, which is shown in Fig. 2(e) . The peak values of 3/12 .

The motion of the arms is driven by a string that is attached to a string role driven by a motor. Once the resuscitator is squeezed, the direction in which the motor is rotating has to be reversed. In the simplest case, this can be achieved using a microswitch, which marks the end position and relays, which switch the polarity of the voltage applied to a DC motor. A more advanced approach, which we present here, includes using a microcontroller and an H-bridge to invert the motion of a DC motor. Placing two microswitches at the two ends of the arms' travel, in the initial (open) and final positions (closed), enables positional feedback to a microcontroller. By changing the position of the microswitch, which indicates the final (closed) state, the pressure and tidal volume can be tuned. The use of a microcontroller enables the control and monitoring of the breathing rate, inspiration to expiration ratio, and opens the possibility to implement complex feedback-based controls (e.g. PEEP control, triggered inspiration).

However, a number of questions remain open and this implies the need of reliability tests, clinical trials, as well as fulfilling regulatory and legal formalities. Furthermore, significant commitment from companies that can manufacture them, or even military industry, will be needed if these concepts are to be converted into real solutions within a reasonable timescale. An important aspect is that, perhaps for the first time a global collection of efforts appeared spontaneously in a very short period, and not only to address the mechanical ventilator availability problem, but many other aspects, yet most of these efforts were disorganized and the convergence of the emergencydevelopment, emergency-manufacture and emergency-legal/regulatory-clearance do not seem to be converging at appropriate speeds to deal with the problem. These aspects will need to be addressed in order to better respond to future crises.",

By increasing the r2, the speed of the motor could be kept unchanged, however, this would cancel out the leverage gained by increasing l.
