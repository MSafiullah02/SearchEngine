[2] [3] [4] [5] The disease seems to spread with human-to-human transmission, 6 implying professionals can be contaminated during the care of some patients. 7, 8 As of February 11, 2020, 3019 Chinese health care workers were infected with COVID-19, and 6 died from it. 9 In recent decades, we have had examples of epidemic coronaviruses. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, infected patients had to undergo emergency surgery. [10] [11] [12] [13] Cases of transmission to health professionals while in operating theaters also have been described in previous epidemics and should be prevented. 10, 14 The situation is rapidly evolving, and we have observed an alarming increase in cases around the world. The European situation is worrying: at the beginning of March 2020, 15 million people were placed in quarantine in Italy and thereafter the whole country, and a significant increase in the number of cases has been observed in other countries, especially in France, which is now in quarantine ( Figure 1 ). The situation subsequently spread worryingly to North America. Surgical emergencies may be multiple, and some infected patients will need surgical care. Facing this increase of cases, in the same way as China, 8,15,16 we will be confronted with patients needing emergency surgery. It is necessary to anticipate and prepare to take care of patients with COVID-19 in the operating room (OR).",

We recommend seeking the advice of the hospital's infectious disease department to consider surgery in a patient with COVID-19. In our centers, scheduled patients are hospitalized 48 hours before surgery. If the patient is asymptomatic, we perform a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening test on the patient's arrival. If the patient is symptomatic, we perform 2 screening tests 24 hours apart, combined with a computed tomography scan of the chest. The same procedure is applied for patients arriving in emergency adjusted to the required delay of surgery. Antibodies are not routine tests at this time. As soon as they will be available and reliable, they probably should be added to the screening strategy and coupled with the PCR technique to optimize preoperative screening.",

In addition to regular temperature monitoring for patients, the surgical staff in contact also must monitor their temperature twice a day. 15 Postoperative temperature monitoring is necessary for patients not at risk who are being treated for another pathology. Indeed, we can cite the situation in a Wuhan hospital with the postoperative appearance of several cases of COVID-19 coronavirus, either in asymptomatic patients Q6 . 16 We recommend the daily washing of hands for staff, patients, and families of patients. Family visits should be limited to the strict minimum. However, in the current situation in our centers, family visits are prohibited. In the case of visits, the patient's family also should wear a surgical mask when visiting the patient, and staff should pay attention to contact with families. Indeed, they can also carry COVID-19, so it is necessary to apply the protection procedures for suspicious cases. ",
