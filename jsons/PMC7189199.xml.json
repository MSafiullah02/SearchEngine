What is more significant is the absent mortality rate among these persons and, to our knowledge, the absence of patients with serious consequences. In a transversal observation made in Alghero, Sardinia, one of the \u201cred counties\u201d of Italy and one with the greatest concentrations of type 1 diabetics in the world, there is just 1 case reported, easily healed. This has been recently confirmed by the ISPAD[1] But what could be the explanation for this strange phenomenon? Traditionally [2], the human immunity to foreign antigens depends critically on the balance of the Th1 and Th2 immunity.",
