Their genome \u2013 a large, single-stranded molecule (size 27000\u201331500 nucleotides) \u2013 has the properties of a mRNA, namely a 5\u2032 cap structure and a polyadenylated 3\u2032 end. The replicase or polymerase gene \u2018Pol\u2019 is located at the 5\u2032 end and contains two large open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b, about 20000 nucleotides) which are expressed as a fusion protein involving ribosomal frame shifting. The polymerase products generate RNA templates for replication of genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. These mRNAs contain a common 5\u2032 leader sequence (65\u2013100 nucleotides) that is derived from the 3\u2032 end of the negative-sense template and is essential for a discontinuous transcription mechanism. The viral proteins are translated from a nested set of 5\u20137 overlapping subgenomic mRNAs with common 3\u2032 ends. In general, only the 5\u2032 end of each mRNA is translated into a single viral polypeptide. Certain mRNAs for nonstructural viral proteins can employ up to three ORFs via internal initiation.",

Bovine coronavirus (BCV), human coronavirus (HCV)-OC43, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), turkey coronavirus (TCV) and some mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains express a hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein termed HE (65 kDa). A small membrane protein sM (9.1\u201312.4 kDa) was demonstrated for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and MHV. The typical gene order for coronaviruses is Pol-S-M-N. The position and expression of genes for HE, sM and nonstructural proteins varies between strains in a complex pattern. The helical nucleocapsid contains the genome and is surrounded by a lipid envelope (Figure 1). The M glycoprotein (20\u201330 kDa) spans this envelope three times. Peplomers (large bulbous projections) are formed by the glycoprotein S, which is cleaved in many coronaviruses to subunits of about 90 kDa (S1 and S2). The S protein induces cell fusion and binds to the host-cell receptor. A smaller fringe of spikes is formed by the HE protein, which promotes binding by interaction with 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid.",

Enteric coronaviruses are only of limited pathogenicity for older animals; respiratory viruses affect adults as well. Some strains are neurotropic, others can involve many different organs. Several coronaviruses readily establish chronic infections, which can remain inapparent or modulate immune responses. In this context, MHV infections of small rodents are interesting models for investigating pathogenetic mechanisms such as demyelination or immunosuppression.

Important antigenic sites of major coronavirus families are in general well defined. The bulbous S1 subunit of IBV displays high antigenic variability and induces serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies which bind to discontinuous epitopes. More conserved sites forming linear epitopes are present on the S2 subunit (stalk) and an immunodominant region was identified which is recognized by antisera against different strains. The most immunogenic sites of BCV and MHV are concentrated on the S1 subunit of the molecule. The S2 subunit of MHV also induces neutralizing and fusion-inhibiting antibodies. The neutralization of TGEV involves four major antigenic sites in the S protein, which help to differentiate members of this cluster.",
