Infection is enzootic in many tropical and temperate regions, coincident with the distribution of biting midges (Culicoides spp) 1, 2, 3. BT is listed as a \u2018notifiable\u2019 disease by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) 4. The virus responsible for BT is classified within the prototype species bluetongue virus (BTV) of Orbivirus, the largest genus within the family Reoviridae. The genome of BTV consists of ten segments of double\u2010stranded RNA encoding seven structural (VP1 to VP7) and four nonstructural (NS1 to NS4) proteins 5, 6, 7. Twenty\u2010seven distinct BTV serotypes (BTV1 to BTV27) induce serotype non\u2010cross protective immunity and have an impact on vaccination strategies 3, 8. BTV usually causes severe haemorrhage and ulceration of the mucous membranes in ruminants, along with fever, lameness, coronitis, pulmonary oedema, swelling of the head (particularly lips and tongue) and death. In this regard, the pathogenesis of bluetongue is similar to that of hemorrhagic viral fevers of humans, such as Ebola virus 2, 9, 10.",

Although BTV, a prototype of the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae, has been extensively studied, the interactions between virus and host cells are not fully understood at present. In this study, we investigated proteomic alterations in BTV\u2010infected ST cells using iTRAQ labeling combined with LC\u2212MS/MS for the first time. The identification of significantly altered proteins in BTV\u2010infected ST cells provides a global overview of the BTV\u2013host cell interaction network. Many of the immune response\u2010related proteins differentially expressed upon BTV infection are novel and have not been reported to date. Elucidation of the functions of these proteins in virus\u2013host cell interactions may be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting BTV.\n",

Compared to mock\u2010infected cells, CPE was minimal at 24 hpi and significant at 48 and 72 hpi, characterized by rounding, swelling, granular degeneration and detachment of cells. At 72 hpi, almost all the cells had detached (Fig. 1A). The one\u2010step growth curve revealed that viral titer reached 5.1 \u00d7 107 PFU/mL at 48 hpi, followed by a gradual decline (Fig. 1B). Generally, the time\u2010point at which viral replication remains high with no significant host cell cytoskeleton or membrane rearrangement is taken as the optimal window for proteomic analysis. To ensure a higher percentage of infected cells and avoid excessive CPE, BTV\u2010 and mock\u2010infected cells were harvested at 24 and 48 hpi for further proteomic analysis. Virus infection at different time\u2010points was additionally confirmed via RT\u2010PCR using a total of 23 cycles. Abundance of viral S7 RNAs increased gradually over time until 48 hpi (Fig. 1C).

Using this approach, a total of 17 471 peptides and 4455 proteins were detected and quantified, among which 101 and 479 proteins displayed significant differences in expression between BTV\u2010 and mock\u2010infected cells at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively, identified by at least two high confidence score (95%) peptides with p\u2010values <0.05, calculated using ProQUANT.

Proteins showing lower than 50% variation accounted for 94% of the total proteins, indicating significant correlation. Since the current sheep genome database is poorly annotated compared to the human genome database, 55 proteins remained unassigned or uncharacterized, resulting in a large number of predicted proteins in our analysis. Further research focusing on the functions of these proteins is therefore warranted.",

The cellular component annotation (GO\u2010CC) revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were well distributed within different cell components, with intrinsic to membrane and organelle lumen being two highly distributed components (12 and 11 proteins, respectively) (Fig. 4A). The molecular function (GO\u2010MF) annotation demonstrated that proteins related to cation binding, nucleotide binding and enzyme binding were most commonly affected by viral infection (Fig. 4B). The biological process (GO\u2010BP) annotation revealed that differentially regulated proteins are involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, immune response, signal transduction, transcription, apoptosis, stress response, and antigen processing and presentation (Fig. 4C). To further investigate the pathway involvement of these proteins, KEGG pathway analysis based on the DAVID program was performed.

Prior to proteomic analysis, we determined which time\u2010points to investigate following infection by observing morphological changes and analyzing viral growth dynamics in BTV\u2010infected cells. The results indicate that BTV induces CPE from 24 to 72 hpi in infected cells, compared to mock\u2010infected cells. Production of mature particles was exponential at 8 and 24 h post\u2010infection 38. Furthermore, virus titer was continuously increased in infected cells until 48 h, at which time we observed the highest viral load. At 72 hpi, all infected cells showed rounding and granular degeneration. BTV infection can terminate host protein expression in the late stage. Thus, to avoid detecting changes in host protein expression caused by interference with translation, proteomic analyses were performed on cells at early infection time\u2010points (24 and 48 hpi). Some viruses, if passaged at MOI>1, accumulate spontaneously deleted defective particles that are maintained during passage by the presence of complementing wild\u2010type helper virus 39. For proteome profiling, although most cells could be infected under high MOI (such as MOI of 1), the levels of most host proteins would be nonspecifically reduced by translational repression or strongly affected by BTV\u2010induced apoptosis. To avoid the changes in protein expression profiles masked by BTV\u2010induced translational shutoff and apoptotic effects, ST cells were infected with BTV at a MOI of 0.1, rather than higher MOI.

It also shapes the adaptive immune response generated by both T and B cells. Production of IFN in response to virus infection is triggered by the recognition of pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns by the infected cell. Activation of innate cellular responses during viral infection requires recognition of pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors 36, 40, 41. The genome of BTV, composed of dsRNA molecules, has been described as a potent inducer of type I IFN, both in vivo and in vitro. Recent studies have shown that BTV triggers type I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells via a MYD88\u2010dependent/TLR7/8\u2010independent sensing and signaling pathway whereas cytoplasmic helicases (RIG\u20101, MDA5) mediate sensing and signaling in BTV\u2010infected epithelial cells 42, 43. However, pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways and the mechanisms responsible for production of IFN in response to BTV are still not completely understood. Type I IFN binds to a common IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), initiating a signaling cascade that results in expression of hundreds of interferon\u2010stimulated genes (ISG). ISGs are key components of the host innate immune response and serve as the first line of defense against viral infection. In our study, 18 upregulated ISG proteins were identified. Among these, interferon\u2010inducible ISG15, ISG20, Mx1, Mx2, RSAD2, OAS1 and OAS2, have been documented as critical antiviral proteins in cells and animals 44, 45. IFIT proteins have also been shown to inhibit virus replication by binding and regulating the functions of cellular and viral proteins and RNAs 46. DDX58 (RIG\u20101) plays an important role in the recognition of RNA viruses in various cells, and has been identified as a candidate cytoplasmic viral dsRNA receptor 47. In the current study, we demonstrated that BTV infection induces overexpression of a number of antiviral proteins, several of which were identified for the first time, including ISG15, ISG20, Mx1, Mx2, RSAD2, OAS1, OAS2, IFI44 and IFIT 36, 48.",

Enhanced expression of STAT1, a key regulator of interferon\u2010responsive genes 49, during BTV infection suggests that the virus activates canonical interferon signaling through the JAK\u2010STAT1 pathway. HSP, also known as stress proteins, are often involved in antigen presentation and intracellular trafficking and apoptosis, and act as molecular chaperones by helping nascent polypeptides assume their proper conformations. HSP27 is linked to different signaling pathways that regulate cellular functions, such as inflammation, apoptosis, development, differentiation and cell growth. In addition, many other viruses, including avian influenza H9N2 50, infectious bursal disease virus 21, and African swine fever virus 51, induce upregulation of HSP27. eIF4A1 was initially characterized based on its requirement in translation and later identified as a component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex responsible for RNA helicase activity 52. Among the virus\u2013host interactions, those that recruit cellular translational machinery to viral mRNAs play a decisive role in viral replication. Viral RNAs have evolved structures to maximize their translation and efficiently compete with cellular mRNAs 53, 54.

In addition to activation, signaling molecules in these pathways may be ubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation, consequently downregulating the IFN response. Viruses have evolved different strategies to utilize the UPS to their advantage. For example, activation of the UPS pathway is necessary for hepatitis E virus replication 57, and also required by other viruses, such as influenza virus 58, vaccinia virus 59, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 60 and rotavirus 61.

In our analysis, four apoptosis\u2010related genes (Casp8, K1967, PML and CIKS) were identified following BTV infection. Caspase\u20108 is an initiator caspase activated by interactions between external apoptotic elements and cell surface molecules. BTV infection led to significant upregulation of caspase\u20108 in virus\u2010infected ST cells, as verified with qRT\u2010PCR. Regulation of cell death is known to be important for replication and pathogenesis in various Orbiviruses 64, 65, 66, and therefore, we propose that further investigation of these proteins should facilitate clarification of the mechanisms underlying cell death regulation during BTV infection.",

The identification of significantly altered proteins in BTV\u2010infected ST cells reflects a comprehensive BTV\u2010host cell interaction network. To our knowledge, many of the immune response\u2010related proteins differentially expressed upon BTV infection are novel and have not been detected in previous studies 36, 48, thus providing new protein targets for evaluation in the future. Elucidation of the functions of these proteins in virus\u2013host cell interactions may additionally uncover new therapeutic strategies targeting BTV.",
