These, it asserts, should be used only when the science is sound, if no proven beneficial intervention exists, if harm is unlikely and the people involved are consenting volunteers. The issue of patient's rights was also taken up by P\u0113teris Zilgalvis 3 of the Council of Europe who noted that this was an active discussion in the Council and that a new Draft Directive Convention on Biomedical Research was to be released in 2004.",

Szawarski. 5 Indeed, the concept of the placebo itself proved quite elusive. Were a new material introduced into a trial, then this may of itself produce an effect. One might regard the introduced material 'inert' with regard to any known mechanism that might ameliorate the disease state, but the introduction of a bitter, unpleasant or bad egg type of taste might radically affect the person so assailed. Again, this author introduced the notion that at very low levels of 'active ingredient' as, for example, part of a 'dose -response' experiment, one might have the equivalent of a placebo that was defined only by the absence of an 'effective' amount of the material under examination. This kind of placebo was challenged as some participants thought that it was possible that however small an amount of test material was available, all the effect observed could have been due to that small amount of material. This is an argument 'in extremis'.",

Clearly, if a beneficial effect was observed that was independent of dose level then that effect may be thought of as a non-specific effect akin to a placebo effect. It could be that the effect varied both positively or negatively with dose level, in which case conclusions may be drawn as to the putative medicament's use level or complete non-use. It is often the case that an effect of concentration is not observed until a particular threshold level of application has been crossed. Any ameliorative effect before the concentration dependent effect is observed may again be considered to be a placebo effect. It should also be noted that this way of testing is independent of other drugs of 'proven' efficacy. It also does not require the introduction of any new material whose effects may be difficult to control: the lowest concentration of the substance under investigation could be present at vanishingly low concentrations -or not be present at all as noted by E.A. Singer. 6",

Here we should distinguish between the examination of a drug or vaccine that is novel, unique and has not any equivalent and the same kind of material that is equivalent to other materials that have already been shown to have effects in the specific area in question. Where the material under test is completely novel the testing of such a material may involve the use of the placebo or zero concentration control except in cases where the patients in the control group are likely to be permanently damaged. Clearly, if it is not known whether or not any efficacy of the new material is likely, then the experimental group is just as likely as the control group to suffer irreversible harm. In this latter case there is a justification of the placebo control even though damage is thought to be likely. Nevertheless, it is hardly likely that a manufacturer would venture forward with a substance that was thought to be as likely to produce harm as benefit. Previous tests in animals would have had to have demonstrated some beneficial properties before a test in humans could be justified to an ethical review board. Under such conditions it would behove the manufacturer to be more concerned about the maximising of the efficacious effects by a determination of the most beneficial methods of delivery of the new material. Here, the way the drug or vaccine is delivered, the organs that receive the material, the number and timing of doses applied and their quantity of material delivered are key variables that need to be determined for every new application. Having discovered the most advantageous routes, times and methods of delivery, it would remain to discover the amount of material that needs to be delivered to achieve the maximised beneficial effects. The determination of a dose-response relationship is the way this can be achieved.",

The superiority may be in the increased degree of efficacy obtained, the achievement of the same ameliorative effect at a lower cost in either monetary terms or in terms of a decrease in unpleasant or unwanted side-effects. Here it is clear that the new challenger material should be tested in a face-to-face manner in the same test against the existing medicament. The use of a placebo control is not necessary as it has (presumably) been shown that the original material under challenge was efficacious in relation to a placebo or zero concentration control in previous trials.",

It may also be that the level of natural challenge in a developing country is many times more powerful than that which obtains in a developed country. Additionally, we have to consider whether the drug or vaccine under examination is relevant to the disease state of the particular developing country in which the trial is sited. If it is not relevant then the ethics of exploitation of a group of people less fortunate that those in the developed country has to be considered. They will have accepted the risk of side reactions and toxic effects in exchange for money. Ethically, there is nothing inherently unacceptable in this situation. A casuistic approach will tell us that in normal employment in the developing world in the nuclear, construction, fishing and agricultural industries there is an ever present danger of injury or death which is accepted in exchange for the going wage rate. The only additional question that is raised with regard to the developing world is the actual magnitude of the reward for the risk undertaken. As there are relatively few cash jobs in the developing world and much unemployment, the temptation to exploit this situation would be considerable. However, to drop below wage levels for jobs of comparable risk in the same circumstances would be unacceptable.",

In a country in which HIV/AIDS infects some 30% of the 20-40 year old age group (Zambia), people are prepared to take higher risks in tests of a putative drug or vaccine than in the USA (circa 0.4% infection rate) as any beneficial effects have disproportionately large consequences. This could mean that placebo controlled tests of a putative drug/vaccine that could cure/prevent AIDS would be more readily acceptable in a developing country. There are many complicating issues that relate to testing AIDS reagents in any country. Issues of informed consent, the education of the people who enter the trial in the advantages of safe sex and the deliberate deprivation of those who do not get into the trial of the same information come into play. A further complication is that those on the trial may believe that they are the 'protected ones' and engage in more unsafe sex. Were some such individuals to be in the placebo group then there would be a higher infection rate, and therefore death rate, amongst them as compared to others who had not been party to the trial. Although AIDS may seem an extreme case, similar life and death situations exist for the diseases of Malaria, Tuberculosis and intestinal and respiratory infections.",

The term placebo may be omitted as this would be sure to bias the results. Nonetheless it is clear that patients entering trial conditions should be 'fully informed' of what is to happen to them. This in itself exerts an effect on the way the trial proceeds. As other speakers pointed out, it is not only the materials that are given directly to the test subject that have effects it is the ambience of their delivery. 8, 9 While the system has to respect the 'autonomy', 'self-determination', 'motivation by rational choices' (Kant) and rights of the individual, the patient also has obligations to be honest, to meet commitments for appointments, permit treatments and to observe the duties and obligations of a contractee to a relationship.

In a placebo controlled trial of such a material what and how the doctor tells the patient about the course of treatment that is to be undertaken is therefore crucial to the outcome of the trial. So how is the 'autonomy' of the patient to be respected? If the patient is told what the doctor really thinks -that both the placebo and the test material do not contain ingredients that the medical profession believes to have any physiological or biochemical activity -then the value of the exercise to the patient is impugned. If the doctor lies and says that he or she is testing both a putatively active material in contrast to a putatively inactive control then the doctor is in default of his or her ethical code. The crux of this issue lies in the probability that the doctor's lie could well be therapeutic and relieve suffering. It may be accepted that the overriding consideration is that it is the principle duty of the doctor to enhance the patient's well-being. In which case the ethical deficit of a lie may prove to be justified: and after all, if there is relief from troublesome symptoms the doctor may indeed not have lied for one of the unknowns in the test is whether or not there is activity associated with the materials on trial. However, the alternative hypothesis cannot be denied in that it is the visit to the doctor and the aura of the doctor-patient interaction which was the curative stimulus merely aided and abetted by the additional, yet evocative, actions of the ingestion or injection of what could easily be coloured sterile water.",

Broken bones, burns, ruptured organs or blood vessels, cuts, bombshell, mine and firearm wounds, are generally unique to the individual and event and efforts to cure and treat them are not generally tested via placebo controls. Another suite of diseases are caused by infection. The two major approaches to dealing with these diseases are via prevention (vaccines) or cure (antibiotics). Vaccines that seek to protect against non-life-threatening diseases (colds due to Rhinoviruses; Coronaviruses and Adenoviruses, German Measles, Chickenpox, etc\u2026) may well be tested using placebo controls or dummy vaccines. Other vaccines directed towards preventable diseases that would otherwise be life-threatening, such as Measles, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A, Smallpox, Polio may or may not, as the conditions dictate, be tested using placebo controls. This often depends on the chosen end-point for the trial. Were the end-point the level of specific antibody then a placebo control could be indicated; however where the end-point was the presence or absence of disease after a defined exposure period then it could be judged unwise to expose placebo treated individuals to a life-threatening situation without protection. Generally speaking, for diseases caused by viruses recourse to medicaments is futile (except perhaps for the Acyclovir treatment of Herpes infection).",

Dopamine, endorphins, seratonin, glutamate, opiates and other small molecules are implicated in such effects as noted by R. del la Fuente-Fernandez. 16 As more experiments are effected that seek to relate the secretion of these chemicals with changes in the brain as evidenced by functional-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or various tomographic techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), d it is becoming increasingly obvious that the above chemicals are implicated in such reactions as reward systems, expectation requitements, love, processes leading to reproduction, pleasure, depression and the fight or flight reactions. What happens between the doctor and the patient affects the excretion of these chemical messengers in the brain with consequent effects on the hormonal or immunological competence of the affected individual. The use of placebo materials to achieve similar effects therefore is precedented. When a patient believes that he or she is being treated by a respected doctor then it is likely that the small molecule balance will shift with effects that may or may not reduce the patients disease symptoms. What needs to be done is to better define the stimulus and the stimulusresponse relationship between what the patient actually experiences and the way such experiences affect the small molecule balance and distribution in the brain. ____________________________________________________ d. http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/bae/courses/bae590f/1995/mullen/index.html",

It should also be noted that there is a suite of syndromes that are particularly prone to be evoked by materials that have no known pharmacological action: headache, stomach pains, skin conditions, breathing disorders/asthma, dyspnoea, tachycardia, depression, Parkinson's syndrome, hypertension, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, jaw pain, rheumatoid conditions and sweating. Insofar as this mental influence can obtrude into the way the body works, so also might placebo/nocebo type situations have some degree of effect. What becomes increasingly clear is that the power that the mind has over bodily functions is only just beginning to be explored. What we believe, and what the quality of those beliefs state is a parameter we cannot continue to ignore if we are to think in terms of preventive health care or the remediation of disease states. The next step in this progression is to learn more about the way we acquire beliefs and the factors that influence the quality of the belief as it exerts its effects in controlling via such organs as the hypothalamus the workings of the hormonal and immune systems. At this symposium F. Porzsolt noted that the effect of such interventions as surgery was dependent on the way the doctor presents the case for such treatment to the patient; he called this 'knowledge framing (Zelendesign)'. 8 However we look at it, there is the potential of a revolution in the way health care is delivered to those in need of release from disease. How far these techniques will extend into the controlling of human minds in the more general interests of society remains to be seen. But these glimmerings of the possible uses to which the control of belief systems can be directed has to be a warning to ethicists who must now consider the creation of the kind of regulatory environment in which such abilities are more likely to adduce benefit than result in harm.",

While the simple instrument of the placebo may show those interested in the efficacy of physiologically active chemicals the extent to which the chemical of interest is actually active, the surprising outcome of such studies is that the placebo per se is worthy of more general study. This, when taken further, points to the ways in which mind can influence the matter of the body. Of course, mind itself is an activity of matter, so we may retain the experimental approach that has told us about the world outside ourselves to examine the world that is inside our brains. New techniques and approaches to these once intractable problems are now in train. Where they will lead us we cannot predict, but as with the emergence of all new tools, we have to adopt those ethics that will carry us forward with the expectation that we will maximise benefits and minimise harms.",
