            "text": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which destroys the body\u2019s immune system by infecting human immune cells and causing patients to eventually die from complications such as severe infections or secondary tumors [1,2]. In 2018, there were approximately 37.9 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS, including 1.7 million children [3]. Moreover, 1.7 million individuals became newly infected in 2018. As there is no AIDS vaccine available, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is still the main clinical treatment of HIV/AIDS. Many HAART comprises two or three antiretroviral drugs acting on different targets, such as reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), and integrase (IN) [[4], [5], [6]]. However, long-term widespread use of HAART can lead to drug-resistant viruses and treatment failure [7]. At least 50% of patients have drug-resistant viruses. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV) have been used for more than 10 years in clinical practice, and stable drug-resistant strains have emerged [8]. Clinical studies have found that after 48 weeks of etravirine and rilpivirine administration, the body produces a virus resistant to both the drugs. Several new forms of NNRTIs have been reported in recent years [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. In consideration of drug resistance continues to increase, the development of new NNRTIs is still worth the challenge.",

Previous studies demonstrated that indirubin, one of the bioactive indole alkaloids of the herbal drug, had the most significant cytotoxicity on IL-60 cells and inhibitory effect on pesudorabies virus (PrV) replication, while extracts from roots and leaves of I. indigotica also showed cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction either before or after infection of PrV on porcine kidney (PK-15) cells [18]. Moreover, from the ethanol extract of \u201cda qing ye\u201d (I. indigotica leaves) an isatisine A-derived artificial acetonide was reported to have a moderate anti-HIV-1 activity (EC50 = 37.8 \u03bcM) [19]. However as far as we know, was neither extract or purified compound from \u201cban lan gen\u201d reported to inhibit HIV virus replication. Because the \u201cban lan gen\u201d decoction is practically used in clinic, whereas the ethanolic extracts were mainly focused in the previous studies, we systematically studied the chemical constituents and biological activities of an aqueous extract of the I. indigotica root, resulted in characterization of more than 100 chemical constituents including around 50 alkaloids and some with antiviral (influenza virus A/Hanfang/359/95, herpes simplex virus 1, and/or Coxsackie virus B3) and cell-damage protective activities [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. A continuation of the work led to characterization of a novel anti-HIV compound methyl (1-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)acetamidobenzoate (CI - 39) (Fig. 1\nA) with an EC50 value of 3.40 \u03bcM from a remaining subfraction. CI - 39 represents the first anti-HIV-1 indolylacetamidobenzoate derivative from I. indigotica, though from other plants a variety of natural products and extracts with inhibition of HIV-1 replication were reported [[35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]].",

Because of limitation of the sample amount from the plant extract, CI - 39 was firstly synthesized with confirmation of the anti-HIV-1 replication. For the structural optimization, the effect of the following structural changes on the anti-HIV-1 activity were investigated in this study: (i) the shift of methoxyformyl on the phenylamine moiety with replacement or introduction of other functional groups; (ii) the replacement of the phenyl ring with an aromatic heterocyclic ring; (iii) the substitution of the N-methoxy group on the indole nucleus by other N-alkoxy groups; (iv) the extension or shortening of the acetamide linker between the indole and phenyl ring units. The synthetic lead compound CI - 39 and most potent derivatives were further tested for their activity against the HIV-1 strains carrying some of the most clinically relevant mutations that confer resistance to NNRTIs. Herein, reported are isolation, structural determination, and synthesis of the lead compound CI - 39, along with synthesis, anti-HIV-1 activity, and structure-activity relationship of 57 new derivatives as well as activity of three optimized compounds 6d, 10f, and 10i as novel NNRTIs against seven NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 strains carrying different RT-mutations. Molecular docking of the lead compound CI - 39 and the most potent compound 10i is also discussed.",

Its IR spectrum showed the presence of amino (3247 cm\u22121), ester and amide carbonyl (1701 and 1677 cm\u22121), and aromatic ring (1585 and 1511 cm\u22121) functionalities in the molecule. Combinatory analysis of HRMS(ESI+) and NMR spectroscopic data led to determination of the molecular formula as C19H18N2O4. In the molecular, the occurrence of a 3-substituted indole nucleus, an ortho-substituted benzene ring, two methoxy groups, an isolated methylene, and two ester and amide carbonyl carbons was deduced from analysis of the NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1\n). The connection of these structural units was further established by the 2D NMR experimental data as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Briefly a linkage between the indole nucleus and one carbonyl carbon via the methylene unit to form a 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetyl moiety was unambiguously established by cross-peaks H-4/H-5/H-6/H-7 in the 1H\u20131H COSY spectrum as well as the two- and three-bond heteronuclear correlations from H-2 to C-3, C-3a, C-7a, and C-8 and from H2-8 to C-2, C-3, C-3a, and C-9 in the HMBC spectrum, along with the chemical shifts of these proton and carbon signals (Fig. 1B). Location of an methoxyformyl at the ortho-substituted benzene ring to construct an methyl ortho-substituted benzoate moiety was deduced from the 1H\u20131H COSY coupling correlations of H-3\u2032/H-4\u2032/H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032 and the long-range HMBC correlations from H-3\u2032 to C-1\u2032 and C-5\u2032 and from H-6\u2032 to C-2\u2032, C-4, and C-7\u2032 as well as from OCH\n3 to C-7\u2032. To satisfy the requirement of the molecular composition, the remaining methoxy unit must be located at the N atom of the 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetyl moiety, in turn which must link via an amide bond to the only opened position of the methyl ortho-substituted benzoate moiety. The deduction was finally proved by X-ray diffraction analysis of a suitable single crystal crystallized in the acetone solution of CI - 39, an ORTEP drawn of the crystal structure shown in Fig. 1C. Thus, the structure of CI - 39 was determined as methyl (1-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)acetamidobenzoate.",

When the number of alkyl linear carbon atoms exceeded to six, the HIV-1 virus replication inhibitions were gradually decreased (6g: EC50 = 1.02 \u03bcM; 6h: EC50 = 1.95 \u03bcM; 6i: EC50 = 4.40 \u03bcM), and completely lost when the carbon atom number reached to 9 (6j). In addition, introduction of the bulky units at the N-atom of the indole moiety also weakened activity, e.g. benzyloxy (6l: EC50 = 8.55 \u03bcM), phenethyloxy (6m: EC50 = 5.50 \u03bcM), and p-methoxybenzyloxy (6n). Complete loss of activity was observed also when electron-withdrawing acetyloxy or benzyloxy substituted at the N-atom of the indole moiety (6o and 6p). Interestingly, as compared with 6d (EC50 = 0.29 \u03bcM), the potency was decreased by ortho-substitution of the electron-withdrawing group CF3 on the phenylamine moiety (6q: EC50 = 4.28 \u03bcM), which differed from 5j, 5m, and 5n. The aforementioned results indicate that the N-alkoxy in the CI - 39 derivatives is required for activity against the HIV-1 virus replication, and the best activity is gained when the number of the linear alkyl carbon atoms is three (6d: EC50 = 0.29 \u03bcM).",

Simultaneous introduction of Cl or Br at the ortho-position of the amino group in the pyridine-4-amine moiety led to a remarkable gain of activity by almost an order of magnitude (10d: EC50 = 0.53 \u03bcM and 10e: EC50 = 0.66 \u03bcM). Further substitution of N-methoxy by N-propoxy (10f: EC50 = 0.06 \u03bcM) or N-butoxy (10i: EC50 = 0.06 \u03bcM) increased activity by one more order of magnitude, while relatively less increase of activity was observed by substitution of N-methoxy with N-pentyloxy (10j: EC50 = 0.13 \u03bcM). In addition, as compared with 10f, activity was reduced by an ortho-fluorine substituent on the pyridine-4-amine moiety (10g: EC50 = 0.33 \u03bcM) or by hydroxylation of the acetyl linker (15: EC50 = 2.01 \u03bcM). Moreover, comparison of 6d (EC50 = 0.29 \u03bcM) and 10h (EC50 = 3.30 \u03bcM) indicated that replacement of 2-chloroaniline by pyrimidin-4-amine reduced activity by an order of magnitude. Further modification of the acetyl linker through oxidation (14) and replacement with a methylene unit (20) resulted in the disappearance of activity. Therefore, in the synthesized derivatives the 3-chloropyridin-4-amine moiety is optimal to replace the methyl 2-aminobenzoate moiety in the natural product CI - 39. The three potent compounds 6d, 10f, and 10i were selected for following investigations. Notably, we discovered that the intermediate 4o (ZT55, inactive to HIV-1) was a highly-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of JAK2V617F against myeloproliferative neoplasms [63] while other derivatives were inactive at 10 \u03bcM. As shown in Table 2, all compounds cytotoxicity was tested, and the cell viabilities were influenced somehow by treating with the compounds at the maximum concentration of 30 \u03bcM; nevertheless, the CC50 of all 59 compounds was higher than 10 \u03bcM, which was the highest concentration on anti-HIV replication assay.",

Due to the low fidelity of HIV-1 replication and over two decades of NNRTIs use in clinic, the NNRTI-resistant mutants have developed. Among these, K103N, Y181C or Y188L, carried by RT, are the most prevalent mutants [67]. Lys103 locates on the outer rim of the NNRTI-binding pocket and in the vicinity of the entrance to the pocket; Tyr181 and Tyr188 locates at NNRTI-binding pocket. When Lys103 changes to asparagine, the RT catalytic pocket is preferred in its closed form, resulting in less electrostatic forces within the NNRTIs [68]. Both Tyr181 and Tyr188 exist at the catalytic pocket, which the NNRTIs act on through the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction of their aromatic rings. As the mutations of Y181C or Y188L occur, the forces between NNRTIs and RT by \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction disappear [69].

Overall, 10f and 10i exhibited better activities and drug resistance folds compared to NVP against six of the seven resistant strains (Table 4\n). Particularly, 10i (EC50 = 0.43 \u03bcM) was more notably more active against the double mutant L100I/K103N comparing to both NVP (EC50 = 0.76 \u03bcM) and EFV (EC50 = 1.08 \u03bcM). It is worth noting that the natural product CI - 39 is the only one fully active on all the viral mutants though it did not exhibit the best activity among the four tested compounds.",

The docking results of 10i into WT RT (Fig. 3\n) showed: (i) \u03c0-alkyl interactions between the indole ring with Lys103, Leu100, Val179, and Val106; (ii) alkyl interactions between the end of the butoxy chain with Val106, Leu234, Phe227, and Pro225, respectively, in addition to an H-bond between the oxygen-germinal hydrogen on the N-alkoxy chain and the Lys101 carbonyl oxygen; (iii) \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the pyridine ring with Tyr181, Tyr188, and Trp229, respectively; and (iv) interactions between chlorine with the Tyr181, Pro95, and Leu100 residues. The docking into the Y181C mutated RT (1JLB) (Fig. 4\na) indicated that the interaction between chlorine and Tyr181 in WT RT was replaced by a \u03c0-alkyl interaction between the pyridine ring and Cys181, while Tyr188 retained the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with the pyridine ring. In addition, the pyridine ring lost its acting force with Leu100, in turn which had a \u03c0-sigma interaction with the indole ring. Differently the docking result of CI - 39 into 1JLB showed that the terminal methyl group of methoxyformyl on the phenylamine moiety shared the \u03c0-alkyl interactions with Trp229, Phe227, and Tyr188 and the alkyl interaction with the Leu234 (Fig. S187b in Supporting Information).",

Meanwhile, the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the pyridine ring and Tyr181 was substituted by a \u03c0-sulfur interaction between the indole nucleus and \u2013SH group. Additionally, the pyridine N atom hydrogen-bonded to the phenolic hydroxy proton of Tyr188 and the terminal \u2013NH2 of Lys223, while the pyridine ring maintained the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with Tyr188. However, the carbonyl oxygen of methoxyformyl on the phenylamine moiety of CI - 39 hydrogen-bonded to the terminal \u2013NH2 of Lys223 and the phenolic hydroxy proton of Tyr188, while Cys181 maintained the same mode of action as 10i (Fig. S187c in Supporting Information). For the positive control NVP, which is resisted by K103N/Y181C double-mutated RT, the docking simulation (Fig. S185c in Supporting Information) showed no interaction of NVP with Asn103. This suggests that the H-bond between the N-alkoxy oxygen atom and the Asn103 amide NH2 group may play an important role in the effect of 10i, which is supported by the experimental data (Table 4).",

The indole ring began to have a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with Tyr188, and the pyridine ring maintained the \u03c0-\u03c0 effect on Tyr181 as well as the acting force with Ile100, in turn which the alkyl-\u03c0 interaction with the indole nucleus was replaced by an alkyl interaction with the N-butoxy chain. Similarly the docking of CI - 39 displayed the terminal carbamide oxygen of Asn103 hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxy group from isomerization of the acetamide unit (Fig. S187d in Supporting Information). However, the mutated Ile100 exhibited the alkyl interactions with both the methyl group of methoxyformyl and the indole nucleus of CI - 39. As the L100I/K103N double-mutated RT resisted EFV, the docking (Fig. S186d in Supporting Information) showed the absence of interaction between the mutated Ile100 and EFV. This suggests that the interactions between 10i/CI - 39 and the mutated Ile100 are effective on their activities compared to EFV (Table 4).",

Based on the unique structure with potent activity against HIV-1 replication, 57 new derivatives were designed and synthesized, of which 24 were active with EC50 values of 0.06\u20138.55 \u03bcM. Structure-activity relationship of these derivatives was clarified. The biological assays demonstrated that CI - 39 and its derivatives displayed their activities by inhibiting RT DNA polymerase, but no acting on RNase H. The synthetic representatives 10f and 10i exhibited much better inhibitory effects on the six of seven tested resistant strains compared to NVP. Moreover, the two candidates strongly suppressed NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 carrying the RT-K103N/Y181C mutation. Especially 10i was superior to both NVP and EFV against the HIV-1RT-L100I/K103N, which suggested that it has the potential for use in developing a new NNRTI. Additionally, the computational docking results also hinted at possible binding mechanisms of the potent 10i. In summary, this class of derivatives has a good antiviral prospect and deserves further investigation.",
