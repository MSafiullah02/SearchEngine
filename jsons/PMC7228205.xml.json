A call for action.\u201d\n1\n In their letter, the authors wonder whether this is the most appropriate time to start immunosuppressive therapy with conventional or biological antipsoriatic treatments, such as cyclosporine (CsA), methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010alpha blockers. Indeed, they fear that the immunosuppressive effect of these drugs might increase the risk of infectious complications and promote the spreading of COVID\u201019 infection in patients with psoriasis.",

To cite one, the calcineurin inhibitor CsA, affecting the function of many members of the cyclophilin family, is able to block the replication of coronaviruses (CoV) of all genera.2, 3 However, its potential clinical application as anti\u2010CoV therapeutic remains limited by its immunosuppressive effects.\n4\n Methotrexate, if used in low, noncytotoxic concentrations, is not able to inactivate antigen presentation by dendritic cells.\n5\n\n",

In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010CoV\u20101, an infection caused by SARS\u2010associated CoV, IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010alpha are upregulated and induced by SARS\u2010CoV spike protein via nuclear factor kappa\u2010light\u2010chain\u2010enhancer of activated B cells pathway.\n7\n Receptors for the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine TNF\u2010alpha have been hypothesized as promoters of pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV.\n8\n IL\u20106 in serum is expected to predict the severity of COVID\u201019, thus there are perspectives on the use of an immunosuppressant, the monoclonal antibody against the receptor for IL\u20106, as potential therapeutic intervention for COVID\u201019. There is current evidence for possible clinical benefits of corticosteroids in critical patients, although there is no clinical guideline for their use.\n9\n\n",

Because of the absence of cases analyzed, more studies need to evaluate the risk of immunosuppression in patients exposed to COVID\u201019. Immunosuppressive monotherapy, target therapy, and absence of significant comorbidities could be associated to a lower risk. Presently, a case\u2010by\u2010case assessment seems more appropriate than stopping the ongoing treatments or undertreating the patients with severe psoriasis.",
