The incidence of mortality and morbidity observed with this pandemic, along with the widespread of disease has created an immediate and urgent need for focused steps to develop a vaccine as an earliest measure that can be utilized for masses (2) . Many candidates are being developed for testing as a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and research data along with prior knowledge of technology behind each candidate becomes key resource to understand the mechanism of demonstrating immunogenicity and efficacy. Amongst different technologies that are being adapted for developing the vaccine candidate, VLPs are known to be a potent technology for increased immunogenicity and there are number of examples of commercial vaccines and candidates under trial as VLPs (3, 4) . Most of the VLP vaccines utilize a major surface protein to form the VLP (5) . A strong B cell response is shown by VLPs even in the absence of adjuvants due to efficient crosslinking with specific receptors on B cells (6, 7) . In developing VLPs as vaccine candidates, one of the significant challenges has been to incorporate multiple surface antigens, express them in a single host and allow self-assembly into a VLP (5) .",

His tag was used to enable detection of the expressed proteins as there are no commercially available antibodies against the proteins S, E and M. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the expression of the three proteins using anti-His antibody with specific band at ~26 kDa and ~9.5kDa for M and E protein respectively ( Figure 1 ) which was also confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. However, a band at ~80kDa was observed for S protein (Figure 1 ) which is due to detection of the S2 domain of S protein. The S protein is known to be cleaved by a host cell protease into polypeptides S1 and S2 in yeast (10) . While the band for the cleaved S2 protein fragment is expected at ~66kDa, we obtained a higher molecular weight band, which may be possibly due to the fact that the protein is known to be glycosylated. The expected molecular weight of the S protein is \u223c140 kDa. Interestingly, peptide mapping data showed presence of the complete S protein sequence, matching to full length 140 kDa protein, suggesting cleavage of S protein by the cellular protease into its two fragments, S1 and the S2, which were found to be coexisting together on the microsomal membrane, and would would get incorporated into the a VLP as it assembles at the ER-Golgi interface.",

Selected clones were taken forward for expression analysis. Expression of the three proteins, S, E, and M were detected using anti-His antibody under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Results in Figure 3 show the expression of S, E and M proteins. We do observe differential expression of the three proteins. Further, a band was observed at ~33kDa which may be due to oligomerization of E and M protein. Interestingly, the band at ~71kDa disappears under non reducing conditions suggestive of formation of high molecular wt. complexes or VLPs. It has been previously demonstrated that co-expression of S, E and M has been shown to form VLPs (10, 11) for SARS-CoV. Importantly, the yeast expression platform along with its GRAS status provides the high scalability, robustness and cost-effective production for billions of dosages which would be the required to fight the pandemic globally.",

Interestingly, TEM analysis showed that VLPs were spherical in shape ( Figure 5A Cloning of \"S\", \"E\" and \"M\" proteins: In order to express the S, E and M proteins from SARs CoV-2 proteins were cloned into our proprietary expression vectors, pYRE100 and pYRI100 (14) . The M protein was cloned in pYRI100 integration vector (pYRI_CMP_His) and integrated into PYPD genome while S and E (pYRE100_CSP_CEP_His) protein were cloned into pYRE100 episomal single expression vector as two separate expression cassettes. The synthetic genes sequence biased and optimised for expression in S. cerevisiae were obtained from GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany). Further, all the genes were synthesized so as to have a His-tag at the C-terminus of the protein for the ease of detection as no antibodies were available.",

Cell lysates of various hours' time point post induction from S. cerevisiae yeast host, overexpressing the three antigenic proteins were fractionated on SEC-HPLC. The high molecular weight peak was absent in the vector transformed cells (negative controls) (Figure 4A). The high molecular weight fraction was collected and subjected to analysis by DLS and TEM. The high molecular weight peak fractions were re analyzed for their purity using SEC-HPLC (Figure 4B). The samples at 72 h post induction, showed maximal concentration of the VLPs in the lysate. The samples, obtained at 72 h post induction from the lysate, were taken forward for DLS and TEM analysis. DLS analysis data showed a range of Particle size of 90 -124 nm, with a mean of 103 \u00b1 17 nm was observed for the VLPs which is evident from the correlation function graph (",

The outer surface was highly dense as compared to the core as observed on negative staining of the VLPs. Mass spectrometric analysis of the VLPs confirmed the presence of S. The E and M protein peptide could not be detected possibly due to their small size. However, the existence of the M protein is understood by the fact for its essentiality for formation of viral envelope(13). This is the first time that the VLP of the SARS CoV-2 virus has been imaged under TEM and allied analytical data concurrently provide the biophysical characterization evidence of a VLP. This would enable to develop a potent vaccine candidate against SARS CoV-2 which being in yeast would be scalable, cost effective and provide a simplified production process.Acknowledgements: The authors thank Dr Vineeta Batra, G.P.
