Moreover, serum Ang II, TG and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were decreased by hepatic ACE2 overexpression (Fig. 3B\u2013D), with little change in serum cholesterol and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (Fig. 3C,D). The amelioration of plasma lipid profiles after ACE2 overexpression suggested that ACE2 might affect whole-body insulin sensitivity. To test whether ACE2 improved glucose metabolism, a glucose tolerance tests (GTT) was performed.

Importantly, ACE2-induced Akt phosphorylation was completely abolished by the ATP receptor P2 antagonist (PPADS) in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, ACE2-induced Akt activation was also partially dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that ACE2-induced Akt activation is partly dependent on ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signaling pathway.",

The present study is the first to clarify the possible mechanisms of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas regulate hepatic steatosis. We show that deletion of ACE2 aggravated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in ACE2\u2212/y mice.

In vitro study, Ang-(1\u20137)/ACE2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. Notably, Akt inhibitors reduced ACE2-mediated lipid metabolism, and what\u2019s more, ACE2-mediated Akt activation can be attenuated by blockade of ATP/P2 receptor/CaM pathway. Taken together, Ang-(1\u20137)/ACE2/Mas axis may reduce liver lipid accumulation partly by regulating lipid-metabolizing genes through ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signaling pathway.

Key transcriptional regulators such as LXR\u03b1 and SREBP-1c coordinately control lipogenesis22. LXR\u03b1 and SREBP-1c increase the expression of key lipogenic genes, including those for FAS, SCD1 and ACC23. ACC1 converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, and inhibits fatty acid entry into the mitochondria reducing \u03b2-oxidation. FAS utilizes both acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to form palmitic acid (C16:0). Besides, adiponectin appears to have a pivotal role in improving fatty acid oxidation and decreasing fatty acid synthesis24. The liver has adiponectin receptors, and their stimulations lead to increased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and thereby decreased hepatic TG content. Aberrant induction of these factors may contribute to hepatic steatosis. In the present study, the changes of these genes in ACE2\u2212/y mice and ACE2-overexpressing HepG2 cells support the idea that ACE2 ameliorates hepatic steatosis.",

ATP has been demonstrated to be a signaling molecule to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway353637. The ATP receptors (P2X and P2Y receptors) mediate such action. P2X receptors are permeable to calcium, which are ligand-gated ion channels37. P2Y receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors which stimulate PLC to increase IP3 production, resulting in calcium release from internal stores37. Increased cytosolic free calcium activates CaM, leading to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway3839. In the present study, we found that the P2 receptor antagonists (PPADS) completely abolished ACE2 induced Akt activation, which reveals a critical role of ATP receptors in this process. Furthermore, Akt activation was also significantly blocked by IP3R antagonist (2-APB), CaM antagonist (CPZ) and depletion of extracellular calcium in HepG2 cells. These data reveal the possible roles of ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signal pathway in ACE2\u2013mediated hepatic insulin resistance and liver lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. What is more, these findings offer another plausible explanation for the molecular basis of the relationship between the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis and liver glucose/lipid metabolism.",

            "text": "Insulin resistance and steatosis is closely associated in the development of NAFLD40. Elevated hepatic FFAs worsen insulin resistance. The accompanying increase in oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production following liver lipid accumulation causes a further increase in insulin resistance, thereby establishing a vicious cycle3. Fatty acid synthesis cross-talks with insulin signaling, and Akt plays a pivotal role in glucose and lipid metabolism signaling pathway41. Akt has been found to not only regulate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, but also play a critical role in the regulation of liver lipid metabolism. Activation of Akt represses lipogenesis and prevents excessive lipid deposition in the liver424344. In addition, the increased phosphorylation level of Akt in the liver is associated with the amelioration of steatosis in diabetic mice45. In our more recently research on the effect of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas axis on hepatic insulin resistance, the phosphorylation levels of Akt increased markedly in ACE2-overexpressing cells, while significantly inhibited in the liver of ACE2\u2212/y mice. As expected, Akt inhibitors can reduce ACE2-mediated lipid metabolism. Furthermore, hepatic overexpression of ACE2 improved hyperglycemia and fatty liver in db/db Mice. Together with these two studies, the mechanism underlying glucose and lipid metabolism could involve the ability of ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137) to activate Akt.",
