            "text": "1. Introduction. Most emerging infectious disease pathogens in humans cross from their natural zoonotic reservoir to human populations where early mutated, reassorted or recombined forms begin to spread from person-toperson [Antia et al. (2003) ]. Examples include human immunodeficiency virus, monkey pox, severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza. Currently, a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain (H5N1) has been spreading from poultry to humans, mostly in Southeast Asia, with possible limited human-to-human spread through close contact in Indonesia [Butler (2006) ]. A concern is that this virus could cause a large scale pandemic as it becomes more adapted to human-to-human transmission. Realtime surveillance provides limited information on small clusters of human cases in terms of symptom onset times and physical location. It is critical to answer two questions in real time: 1. Is the infectious agent spreading from person to person? and 2. If it is, how transmissible is it? The first question is novel and, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in the statistical literature. The second question is an estimation problem, and various statistical methods using household data are applicable, such as the models based on observed final infection status [Longini and Koopman (1982) , Becker and Hasofer (1997) , O'Neill and Roberts (1999) ] and those based on a discretetime sequence of symptom onset [Rampey et al. (1992) , Yang, Longini and Halloran (2006) ]. Our major goal in this paper is to answer the first question, but an estimation method is needed for this goal. We base our approach on that in Yang, Longini and Halloran (2006) .",

            "text": "The statistical questions hinge on inference about the transmissibility of the infectious agent. The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is the fundamental measure of the transmissibility of an emerging infectious agent. Given that the emerging infectious agent is transmissible, estimates of R 0 will generally be small and are not very informative. In addition, estimation of some epidemic characteristics such as secondary attack rates (SAR) and R 0 heavily relies on the specification of a correct transmission model. When there is no person-to-person transmission, estimates of these characteristics may be nonzero, but are not meaningful. Therefore, a test of the existence of personto-person transmission can provide a solid ground for parameter estimation. Specifically, one would like to test whether the person-to-person transmission probability, no matter how it is defined, is 0. As a probability always takes values from 0 to 1, the boundary value 0, which is a nonstandard condition, imposes an immediate challenge, because the null distribution of standard statistics, based on which tests are performed, are generally difficult to track. Although statisticians have discussed asymptotic tests for a limited set of scenarios [Moran (1971) , Self and Liang (1987) , Feng and McCulloch (1992) ], more often such an asymptotic null distribution is not available for a specific case. Furthermore, the validity of asymptotic tests depends on relatively large sample sizes, which may compromise the power of such tests to detect person-to-person transmission if applied to a small sample size, such as those generated by avian influenza. These challenges motivate our investigation in exact rather than asymptotic testing methods.",

The data structure we usually observe is a sequence of symptom onsets and associated cluster information, for example, at what time a symptom onset occurred in which household. To construct a probability model with a reasonable level of complexity from the observed data, it is necessary to make basic assumptions about the natural history of the disease and the transmission mechanism. We assume that the incubation period is the same as the latent period, but other assumptions could be made about the relation of the two periods. We make the following additional assumptions about the disease. Any newly infected person remains asymptomatic over a period of \u03b4 days (the incubation period) before symptom onset, where \u03b4 is a random quantity with a distribution of g(l) = Pr(\u03b4 = 1), l = \u03b4 min , \u03b4 min + 1, . . . , \u03b4 max . We denote by \u03b4 min and \u03b4 max the minimum and maximum durations (in days) of the latent period. Upon symptom onset, the person becomes and remains infectious over a period of \u03b7 days (infectious period), where \u03b7 is also a random quantity with a distribution f (l) = Pr(\u03b7 = l), l = \u03b7 min , \u03b7 min + 1, . . . , \u03b7 max . Similarly, \u03b7 min and \u03b7 max are the minimum and maximum durations of the infectious period. In this paper our method requires pre-specifying g(l) and f (l).",

We assume that the whole community is exposed to some external source with a constant level of infectivity for S days. Such an external common source takes into account all possible channels, such as exposure to infected animals, through which the disease can be introduced into the community. Let b be the probability that a susceptible person in the community is infected by the common source during one day of exposure. The probability of infection by the common source throughout the S-day exposure period is called the community probability of infection (CPI) and is given by [Longini and Koopman (1982) ]. Once the disease is introduced into the community, transmission between people may occur through contacts. There are various types of contacts one can define. We define a contact as all possible interactions during one day that can potentially transmit the disease from an infective person to a susceptible person. We consider two levels of contacts: close contacts between two persons who live in the same household and casual contacts between two persons who live in different households but may make contact in the community. We denote by p 1 the daily probability of transmission with a close contact, and by p 2 with a casual contact.",

Two quantities related to transmission probabilities that we would also like to estimate are the SAR and R 0 . The SAR is defined as the probability of infection if a susceptible is exposed to an infective during his or her infectious period. Corresponding to the levels of contact, there are two types of SAR defined as SAR k = l f (l)(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p k ) l ), k = 1, 2. SAR 1 is the SAR within households and is of more epidemiological interest than SAR 2 . The basic reproductive number refers to the expected number of people a typical infective person can infect among a large susceptible population. Here we are interested in the expected number of people that an infective person can infect given that he or she is the first infected person in this community. We refer to this as the local reproductive number R. Estimates of the local R cannot be generalized to a broader context because of the potential selection bias. The clusters are often selected based on a number of cases and may represent higher R 0 than in the general population. For a community of N households with a uniform household size",

Explicit expression of the likelihoods are given in the Appendix. The likelihood ratio statistic asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom when H 0 is true, if all regularity conditions hold for this probability structure [Lehmann (1999) ]. However, two nonstandard conditions are present in our case. One is that the hypothesized parameter values under testing are boundary. As mentioned before, the asymptotic null distribution is generally difficult to track when boundary values are to be tested. Self and Liang (1987) discussed asymptotic distributions of the likelihood ratio statistic for some settings of boundary parameters, but our case is not one of them. The other nonstandard condition is that the parameters to be tested affect the domain of observable data. When p 1 = p 2 = 0, infections are confined to the S days with exposure to the common infective source. Therefore, no symptom onset can happen after day S + \u03b4 max . When p 1 = 0 or p 2 = 0, the domain of the observable data is much larger. No valid asymptotic test exists when this nonstandard condition is present, unless we only use the data up to day S for testing at the price of losing some information.",

While employing less stringent model assumptions, these methods can attain the same level of statistical power as standard tests [Hoeffding (1952) , Box and Andersen (1955) ]. Permutation tests (or randomization tests) have been well developed in the setting of two-sample comparison and ANOVA [Fisher (1935) , Pitman (1937) , Welch (1990) ]. For the boundary problem with parameter values specified by H 0 , the bootstrap was used in combination with the likelihood ratio statistic to test the number of components in mixture models [McLachlan (1987) , Feng and McCulloch (1996) ]. We propose two approaches, a simple permutation test and a more refined one, for the problem of testing the person-to-person transmission probability. These resampling-based methods do not suffer from the two nonstandard conditions mentioned above, as shown by a simulation study. When the observed data are truly generated from H 0 , we can reassign all of the observed symptom onset days (and associated infection status) to a different collection of individuals, and every such rearrangement is equally likely with the same likelihood L 0 . The empirical distribution of the test statistic calculated from permuting symptom onset days across the population can then be used to approximate the null distribution under H 0 . This simple permutation test can be refined by varying symptom onset days of infected individuals in any given permuted data while keeping the likelihood L 0 under the null hypothesis unchanged. The refined permutation test resamples data points from a much larger sampling space as compared to the simple permutation test. Technical details concerning development of the two resampling methods can be found in the Appendix.",

For a realized epidemic, one of the two models may not be admissible (or possible). For example, when the minimum interval between any pair of consecutive cases is larger than the maximum duration of the latent period, no infection can be possibly attributed to person-to-person infection; thus, only the null model is admissible. On the other hand, when there is any case on or after the day S + \u03b4 max , where \u03b4 max is the maximum duration of the latent period, only the full model is admissible because the common source is infective up to day S.

            "text": "3. Results. For simplicity, we simulate epidemics over a community composed of 100 households, each of size 5. We let the exposure to external common source last S = 30 days, and let the epidemic exhaust itself. We do not introduce initial cases to start the epidemic, but let the common source initiate infection. Simulation runs with zero infections were discarded. We simulate epidemics based on g(l) = 1 3 , l = 1, 2, 3, and f (l) = 1 3 , l = 3, 4, 5, and these distribution are correctly specified by the methods that we evaluate. All p-values presented in this section are obtained by the refined permutation test, but simulations show that the simple permutation method gives similar results under the same population and parameter settings as discussed here, except that it tends to be too conservative about preserving type I error for extremely small b. As p 2 is of limited interest, we fix it at 0.00005 (SAR 2 = 0.0002), and vary b from 0.0002 to 0.002 (CPI from 0.006 to 0.058) with a step of 0.0002. We vary p 1 from 0.004 to 0.046 (SAR 1 from 0.016 to 0.17) with steps chosen specific to b so as to yield power values in the range of (0.6, 1.0). All tests are performed at the level of 0.05, that is, we intend to have type I errors of no more than 5% when p 1 = p 2 = 0. An epidemic curve of a sample run for b = 0.001 (CPI = 0.03) and p 1 = 0.014 (SAR 1 = 0.055) is displayed in Figure 1 , with each block representing a symptomatic case. Cases from the same household are filled with the same color. A pattern is evident that cases in the same household tend to cluster together in time. The CPI, R and SAR given in the figure are based on the true parameters, but they could be estimated from the data as well. Results based on 2000 simulations and 2000 permutations for each test are presented in Table 1 . The first row where p 1 = p 2 = 0 gives type I errors for various values of b, from which it is observed that type I errors are all preserved at the specified level. As expected, larger p 1 yields higher power for fixed b; similarly, larger b also yields higher power for any given p 1 . Surprisingly, when there are as few as a total of only seven cases, it is still possible to have 80% power with a moderate p 1 (SAR 1 = 0.14), which means that person-to-person transmission can still be detected even when there is a very limited number of cases. This finding could be very useful as most avian influenza epidemics in humans in recent years have a scale of eight total cases or fewer. Of interest as well is that all of the R values are below 1, as seen from the last column of Table 1 . Figure 2 illustrates the information in Table 1 , where power levels are shown in different colors and symbols with b and p 1 as the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The 80% power contour curve obtained by Loess smoothing lies between green circles and red downward triangles. This figure clearly displays the trend of such a contour curve, descending sharply at b = 0.0002 (CPI = 0.006) and becoming flat around p 1 = 0.008 (SAR 1 = 0.032) as b increases to 0.0014 (CPI = 0.041). Let N idx denote the mean number of index cases and N tot the mean total number of cases, averaging over all simulated epidemics. As only the number of cases are observable in real epidemics, we replace b and p 1 with N idx and N tot as the axes in Figure 3 . Not surprisingly, the underlying 80% power contour curve looks more linear, since roughly N tot \u2248 (1 + R)N idx . While R depends on p 1 , the range of 1 + R is relatively narrow, about [1.2, 1.3] at b \u2265 0.0006, and becomes narrower as b increases. The figure also indicates that the power to detect person-to-person transmission is jointly determined by N idx and N tot , instead of either alone. We fitted a linear regression between the complementary log-log transformed power values and selected transformations of N idx and N tot , and found the following empirical formula:",

Figure 4 plots the simulated vs. fitted power values, where most points fall close to the diagonal line, indicating that the empirical formula gives decent prediction, except for one point at b = 0.0002 and p 1 = 0.03, where the predicted power, 0.71, is somewhat lower than the simulated power, 0.75. Such an empirical formula could be used to predict power levels at various values of N tot and N idx for which simulations are not performed. The coefficients in the empirical formula will likely change for different parameter settings, and the linearity may not always hold. To investigate how sensitive the statistical power of the permutation test is to the distribution of the latent period, we vary the true mean duration from 1.5 to 14 days, while keeping g(l) a uniform distribution over three days. These distributions of the latent period are correctly specified in the models. We expect to see an increase in power, because increasing the latent period is essentially increasing the generation time between successive cases [Fine (2003) ]. To look at the trend of changes in power when b is small, medium and large, simulations were done under three parameter settings: . The values of p 1 are chosen to ensure that the initial power is below 0.8 and has the potential of reaching or exceeding 0.8. Results are displayed in Figure 5 . Overall, power increases, and the rate of increment decreases, as the mean duration of the latent period (and thus the generation time) becomes longer. However, the rate of increment is higher at larger values of b, which means that the power of the refined permutation test is more sensitive to the distribution of the latent period when b is large. Such sensitivity does not compromise the usefulness of the permutation test, since our simulation study is performed under the setting with the minimum level of power. For avian influenza, the mean latent period may be as long as 14 days, and the power will very likely be higher than in our simulation setting.",

More importantly, the resampling methods remain valid in many settings where the asymptotic method is not applicable or not available yet. We have shown that, for an infectious disease with relatively rare incidence, person-to-person transmission could still be detected with decent power even if the total number of cases is as few as seven or eight, given that the transmission probability is high and the population is relatively large. We have studied the statistical power of the resampling methods under the model with two levels of contacts: within households and between households.

Estimating g(l) and f (l) solely from a sequence of symptom onsets is an ongoing research topic and is only practical for a relatively large number of cases [Wallinga (2004) , Cauchemez (2006) ]. To use our method in real epidemics, one could choose a range of plausible settings of g(l) and f (l), and any setting yielding a significant p-value is a warning sign of transmission between human beings. Appropriate adjustment for multiple testing could be used, but one should be aware that these tests are highly correlated as they are essentially based on the same data set, and a Bonferroni-type adjustment is likely to be over-conservative.",

If the null hypothesis is true, each sample point in the class occurs with equal probability. That is, if such a class is identifiable, we can obtain the null distribution of the test statistic by resampling sample points from the class with equal probability. Clearly, sample points obtained by permuting the observed infection status and associated symptom onset dates across the population belong to the likelihood equivalence class. Generally, the whole likelihood equivalence class is difficult to identify, and the use of permuted samples is straightforward and fruitful.

Therefore, one can randomly re-arrange the infection status and infection times while keeping the likelihood value unchanged, as long as the sum of infection times ( i\u2208Dt i ) and the number of infections (\u00d1 ) remain the same. Each re-arrangement is a sample point in the likelihood equivalence class. To keep\u00d1 unchanged, a permutation of the infection and associated symptom status across the population would suffice, and we refer to it as the initial stage of the resampling procedure. The next stage, which we call the refinement stage, is to draw a sample point with equal probability from all possible distinct re-arrangements of infection times, given the infected cases are fixed. If the refinement stage is not carefully planned, the principle of equal probability can be easily violated, and the consequence is incorrect type I error and/or insufficient statistical power. The problem can be re-stated as sampling with equal probability from all distinct arrangements of n balls (sum of infection times) into m boxes (infected cases), each box with a fixed volume of v (S). Let W (n, m, v) be the number of all possible distinct arrangements for such condition. This is a recursive system that can be solved by",

The main deviation from the above ideal situation is that, because some cases may have special exposure history, re-arrangement of their symptom onset times will likely change the whole likelihood, and thus, they should be excluded from the refinement stage. One example is seen in simulations, where we let the exposure to a common source of infection last from day 1 to day S, and let the latent period vary from \u03b4 min to \u03b4 max days. For any case i with symptom onset timet i > \u03b4 max , there are \u03b4 max \u2212 \u03b4 min + 1 days in which infection could happen, that is, any day betweent i \u2212 \u03b4 max andt i \u2212 \u03b4 min . Symptom onset time of case i could be re-arranged from day \u03b4 max + 1 to day S + \u03b4 min without changing the likelihood of the null model, as long as the sum of symptom onset times are not changed. However, there may be cases with symptom onset between day \u03b4 min + 1 and day \u03b4 max , for whom the number of days in which infection could happen is less than \u03b4 max \u2212 \u03b4 min + 1. Re-arrangement of symptom onset times of these cases will very likely change the likelihood because the number of potential infection days will also change. Similarly, cases with symptom onset after day S + \u03b4 min should be excluded from the refinement stage as well.",

Only data observed up to day S, the last day of exposure to the common infective source, are used for testing to make the comparison fair, because the asymptotic test cannot handle data beyond day S + \u03b4 max . The resampling method has two variations, one involving only the initial permutation stage, and the other having both stages. The former is referred to as the simple permutation test, which is widely applied to many problems; and the latter is called the refined permutation test in this paper to make a distinction between these two variations. We shall show through simulations that the refined permutation test has some advantages over both the simple permutation test and the asymptotic test for small sample sizes, and that the three tests tend to be equivalent for large sample sizes. By large sample size, we mean both a relatively large population and a large number of cases of the disease. We first present simulation results in Table 2 for a small population composed of 4 households, each of size 5. Values of b and p 1 are chosen to cover a full range of statistical power levels. When p 1 = 0, the reported values are type I errors. Clearly, the refined permutation test preserves type I error at the specified level of 0.05 for all settings of b. The asymptotic test is the most conservative in rejecting the true null hypothesis by having the smallest type I errors when there are 10 or fewer cases. Surprisingly, the simple permutation test is also conservative when there are only few cases, but less so than the asymptotic test. When b is as large as 0.03 (CPI = 0.6), all methods preserve type I error equally well. In terms of statistical power, the refined permutation test is superior to both of the other two methods. The simple permutation test, however, has the lowest power when there is a fair number of secondary (nonindex) cases, especially when both b and p 1 are large.",
