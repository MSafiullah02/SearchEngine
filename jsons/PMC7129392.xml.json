Clinical signs include high fever, depression, anorexia and laboured abdominal breathing (Shope, 1931, Olsen et al., 2006), and the virus replicates in epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa, tonsils, trachea and the lungs, the major target organ. Infected susceptible pigs exhibit extensive gross lung lesions with microscopic evidence of necrosis, desquamation of bronchiolar epithelium and neutrophil infiltration (Olsen et al., 2006). Infection is generally limited to the respiratory tract and attempts to demonstrate viraemia or virus replication outside the tract have been largely unsuccessful.",

Haptoglobin binds free haemoglobin thus removing it from the circulation, LBP binds and neutralises LPS and CRP has roles in macrophage activation and opsonisation. The cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 appear to be the main inducers of APPs (Petersen et al., 2004). Following experimental influenza virus infection of human volunteers, CRP in sera peaked 3 days PI (Whicher et al., 1985), and in natural infection CRP is significantly higher in acute relative to convalescent sera (Falsey et al., 2001, Melbye et al., 2004). Haptoglobin concentrations peaked 7\u201310 days PI in horses following experimental infection with influenza virus (Kent and Goodall, 1991) and in horses naturally infected with equine influenza virus, serum amyloid A was elevated during the acute stage of the disease (Hulten et al., 1999).

Furthermore, the profiles of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 in BALF in our infection model are similar to those in BALB/c mice and to nasal lavage fluid from infected human volunteers (Monteiro et al., 1998, Fritz et al., 1999).",

High concentrations of IL-18 were found in rat lung homogenates by ELISA (Jordan et al., 2001) and both pro and mature IL-18 have been detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Puren et al., 1999).

These PRCV-infected animals also had unchanged serum and elevated BALF LBP concentrations, whilst serum HG levels peaked later than in SIV-infected pigs. The finding that LBP increased in BALF and not in serum suggests local pulmonary production of LBP, a hypothesis supported by the finding that A549 human epithelial cells produce LBP in response to IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Dentener et al., 2000).
