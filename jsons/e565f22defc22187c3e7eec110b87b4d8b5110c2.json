The consequent acute respiratory syndrome has placed a considerable strain on healthcare systems, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality [1] . Even in countries which have been able to limit the number of individuals infected with COVID-19 there has been a seismic shift in traditional platforms for health care delivery in an effort to reduce community transmission [2] . Although the major attention of coronavirus infection from a clinical perspective has focussed on the respiratory complications, there are likely to be considerable cardiovascular implications for those with CVD, and sequelae from the pandemic [2] . Early-stage case fatality rates for those with underlying health conditions in China were highest for CVD (10.5%) and more than ten times that of those without CVD [3] . It is also recognised that up to 20% of patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness with coronavirus develop either myocarditis, myocardial injury, arrhythmia or venous thromboembolism [2] .",

Efforts to reduce social contact and community concerns regarding potential transmission have led to reduction in emergency department presentations for acute coronary syndromes by more than 50% [4] . These patients miss the opportunity to receive evidence-based interventions with demonstrated protective effects on future cardiovascular events and death. Furthermore, in the patient with established atherosclerotic CVD, changes in access to the health care system has potential implications for high risk patients to receive secondary prevention strategies. This is important given that patients with coronary heart disease have between 20-35% absolute risk over 5 years of experiencing a new heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death [5, 6] , with the greatest risk occurring during the first year following hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome [7] .",

The inclusion of psychosocial interventions as part of routine heart health checks, cardiac rehabilitation, and the promotion of established mental health services is warranted. Early evidence from China suggests that establishment of external emergency mental health expert teams and provision of online public education, psychological counselling and hotline services may have helped to buffer some of the negative mental health outcomes associated with COVID-19 [28] .
