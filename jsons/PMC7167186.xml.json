Although Deeb and DiGiacomo (2000) identified cardiomyopathy as a relatively common post\u2010mortem examination finding in older rabbits, they did not describe the underlying primary heart disease. Heart failure and atherosclerosis reportedly increase with age in the older pet rabbit (Deeb and DiGiacomo 2000). Specific infectious causes of myocardial disease, either in laboratory or pet rabbits include salmonella, coronavirus (DiGiacomo and Mare 1994) and Encephalitozoon cuniculi (Koller 1969, Csokai 2009a) while chronic stress induced by overcrowding has been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (Weber and Van der Walt 1973). Congenital heart defects and pericarditis secondary to chronic respiratory infection have also been described (Li and others 1995, Deeb and DiGiacomo 2000).",

That case had some similarities to the two rabbits reported herein, including acute onset dyspnoea, atrial fibrillation and VPCs. Pathological similarities included bilateral atrial enlargement, pericardial effusion and myocardial degeneration. However, there were some differences. In the previously reported rabbit severe cardiomegaly was present but pleural effusion and renal lesions were absent. In this current report, the aetiology of the heart disease remained undetermined in both rabbits. In case 1, the gross and microscopic features and lack of significant vascular disease correlated best with a primary cardiomyopathy, most likely hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This was supported by the increased ventricular wall thickness bilaterally, the bi\u2010atrial dilation, myocardial fibrosis and absence of ventricular dilation. In case 2, the gross cardiac findings were more suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy. The echocardiographic findings in both cases indicated both asymmetric concentric hypertrophy, atrial dilation and, in case 1, poor systolic function, suggesting an unclassified cardiomyopathy.",
