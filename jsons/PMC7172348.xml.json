These include children with cancer because they may experience longer lasting influenza and more frequent severe and fatal complications, and this can cause delays in administering chemotherapy [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Finally, children with cancer shed influenza viruses for a longer period of time than immunocompetent subjects, and therefore represent a possible infection reservoir for other children with similar diseases hospitalised in the same ward [9].",

The symptoms of a respiratory illness included at least one of the following: runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, earache, wheezing and shortness of breath [17], [18], [19]. The respiratory symptoms had to last at least 3 days to be considered in the analysis, and only one new-onset illness could be included in any 2-week period. The upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) included: (a) pharyngitis, defined as the presence of a sore throat and evidence of inflammation of the uvula and pharynx or tonsils with fever; (b) acute rhinosinusitis, defined as persistent rhinorrhea for more than 10 days and up to 3 weeks; and (c) croup, defined as inspiratory stridor, cough and hoarseness due to an obstruction in the laryngeal region [20]. The lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) included: (a) acute bronchitis, defined as cough and/or rhonchi in the chest radiographic absence of infiltrates beyond the perihilar area or consolidation or empyema; (b) wheezing, defined as cough and/or dyspnea with expiratory rales and/or wheezes unrelated to any known specific sensitisation; and (c) pneumonia, defined as fever, cough, tachypnea and decreased breath sounds or localised rales in the chest radiographic presence of infiltrates beyond the perihilar area or consolidation or empyema [20].",

Chemotherapy for cancer is immunosuppressive, and B and T lymphocyte functions usually recover 6 months after its completion, although recovery and the normalisation of immunoglobulin levels may take up to 1 year [23], [24], [25]; furthermore, studies have shown that children vaccinated within a few months of completing cancer therapy show a lower (but in most cases equally protective) antibody response to a number of vaccines [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35].

On the contrary, the medical and socioeconomic consequences of influenza-like illnesses in our children who had been off therapy for more than 6 months were similar to those observed in the healthy children. These findings suggest that children who have been off cancer therapy for less than 6 months should be considered at risk for influenza-related complications, but not those who have been off therapy for longer.",

Another limitation is the fact that no virological data are available because of the high cost of the virological assays and the absence of an adequate grant for influenza tests. However, the fact that no difference in the frequency of infections other than influenza-like illness was observed in the vaccinated and unvaccinated children regardless of the length of the off therapy period supports the benefits of vaccination on influenza-like illnesses. Furthermore, given the high mean age of our study population, other respiratory viruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and human coronaviruses) play a minor role in causing influenza-like illnesses in comparison with influenza viruses, especially if strict enrolment criteria are used as in our study. Despite these limitations, our study represents a major contribution to our knowledge of the role of influenza and the benefits of influenza vaccination in oncohematological patients and may allow the better evaluation of the real risk of influenza-related complications in such subjects. On the other hand, a recently published Cochrane review focused on influenza vaccination in children being treated with chemotherapy for their cancer highlighted the need for getting more knowledge on the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccination in oncohematologic children [40].",
