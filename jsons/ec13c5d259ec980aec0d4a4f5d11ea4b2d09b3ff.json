The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was traced to the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, where a cluster of viral pneumonia cases was first detected, many in connection with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. China reported this outbreak to the WHO on December 31 st , 2019 and soon after identified the causative pathogen as a betacoronavirus with high sequence homology to bat coronaviruses using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as the dominant mechanism of cell entry Wan et al., 2020b) . Following a likely zoonotic spillover, human-to-human transmission events were confirmed with clinical presentations ranging from no symptoms; to mild fever, cough, and dyspnea; to cytokine storm, respiratory failure, and death. SARS-CoV-2 is also closely related to SARS (retrospectively named SARS-CoV-1) and MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) coronaviruses, causing local outbreaks and zoonotic epidemics in 2003 , respectively (de Wit et al., 2016 . While SARS-CoV-2 is not as lethal as SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV (Fauci et al., 2020) , the considerable spread of the current pandemic has brought tremendous pressure and disastrous consequences for public health and medical systems worldwide.",

In response, trainees and faculty members of the Precision Immunology Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (PrIISM) have initiated an institutional effort to critically review the preprint literature (Vabret et al., 2020) , together with peer-reviewed articles published in traditional journals, and summarize the current state of science on the fast evolving field of COVID-19 immunology. We thematically focus on the innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses, clinical studies and prognostic laboratory correlates, current therapeutic strategies, prospective clinical trials, and vaccine approaches. (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2009; Ivanov et al., 2004) , thereby resembling host mRNA to promote translation, prevent degradation, and evade RLR sensing. Finally, CoVs also encode an endoribonuclease, NSP15, that cleaves 5' polyuridines formed during viral replication, which would otherwise be detected by MDA5 (Deng et al., 2017; Hackbart et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses have evolved additional strategies to impede activation of PRRs. SARS-CoV-1 N-protein prevents TRIM25 activation of RIG-I . Likewise, MERS-CoV NS4a, which itself binds dsRNA, impedes PKR activation (Comar et al., 2019; Rabouw et al., 2016) and inhibits PACT, an activator of RLRs (Niemeyer et al., 2013; Siu et al., 2014) . Additionally, MERS-CoV NS4b antagonizes RNAseL, another activator of RLRs (Thornbrough et al., 2016) . The role of other PRRs remains unclear. For example, SARS-CoV-1 papain-like-protease (PLP) antagonizes STING, suggesting that self-DNA may also represent an important trigger (Sun et al., 2012) . The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 homologs overlap in these functions is currently unknown.",

Although no experimental studies have delineated the precise functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, proteomic studies have demonstrated interactions between viral proteins and PRR signaling cascades. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b indirectly interacts with the signaling adaptor MAVS via its association with Tom70 (Gordon et al., 2020) , consistent with prior reports that SARS-CoV-1 ORF9b suppresses MAVS signaling (Shi et al., 2014) . Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 interacts with signaling intermediate TBK1, and NSP15 is associated with RNF41/Nrdp1, an activator of TBK1 and IRF3 (Gordon et al., 2020) . Similarly, SARS-CoV-1 M protein is known to inhibit the TBK1 signaling complex (Siu et al., 2009) , as does MERS-CoV ORF4b (Yang et al., 2015) . Other proteins, including SARS-CoV-1 PLP, N, ORF3b and ORF6, block IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Devaraj et al., 2007; . NF-kB is also inhibited by CoVs proteins. These include SARS-CoV-1 PLP (Frieman et al., 2009 ) and MERS-CoV ORF4b and ORF5 (Canton et al., 2018; Menachery et al., 2017) . Finally, SARS-CoV-1 NSP1 (Huang et al., 2011a; Kamitani et al., 2009 ) and MERS-CoV NSP1 (Lokugamage et al., 2015) initiate general inhibition of host transcription and translation, thus limiting antiviral defenses nonspecifically.",

However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 shares only 69% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-1, suggesting this function may not be conserved.

Importantly, these immune signatures track with progression of clinical disease. scRNAseq studies performed on pulmonary tissues of patients with severe COVID-19 disease have revealed an expansion of IMs and Ficolin-1 + monocyte-derived macrophages, at the expense of tissue-resident reparative alveolar macrophages (AM) . The aforementioned study also observed signatures of IFN-signaling and monocyte recruitment that likely contribute to the rapid decline in alveolar patency and promote ARDS. Although most of the clinical focus has been on pulmonary damage and mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) dysfunction therein, it is increasingly clear that COVID-19 likely presents systemic challenges in other organ sites such as the ileum and kidneys. Understanding the role of non-pulmonary myeloid cells in tissue-specific pathology associated with COVID-19 will be important.",

SARS-CoV-1 infection in mouse models results in an aberrant AM phenotype that limits DC trafficking and T cell activation (Zhao et al., 2009) . Additionally, YM1 + FIZZ1 + alternative macrophages can increase airway hypersensitivity, thus exacerbating SARS-associated fibrosis (Page et al., 2012) . Further, as described above, murine SARS-CoV-1 studies have demonstrated that delayed IFN-I signaling and inflammatory monocytes-macrophages promote lung cytokine and chemokine levels, vascular leakage, and impaired antigenspecific T cell responses, culminating in lethal disease (Channappanavar et al., 2016) . The role played by prominent IFN-producing pDCs in SARS-CoV-2 control or pathogenesis warrants investigation, as they have been shown to be critical in murine coronavirus (MHV) control (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007) . Longitudinal studies in SARS-CoV-2 models are awaited, but initial phenotypic studies in humanized hACE2 mice have shown the characteristic alveolar interstitial pneumonia, with infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes and accumulation of macrophages in the alveolar lumen (Bao et al., 2020a) , which recapitulates patient findings . Lastly, Nonhuman primate (NHP) studies and patient data on SARS-CoV-1 have also shown that virus spike-specific IgG responses can exacerbate acute lung injury due to repolarization of alveolar macrophages into pro-inflammatory phenotypes and enhanced recruitment of inflammatory monocyte via CCL2 and IL-8 (Clay et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019) . However, the extent to which the antibody response contributes to disease pathophysiology remains to be confirmed.",

While macrophages are somewhat susceptible to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 infection (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Zhou et al., 2014) , data do not suggest that they are infected by SARS-CoV-2, although one study reported ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is expressed in lymph nodes and spleenassociated CD169 + macrophages of COVID-19 patients producing IL-6 . Significantly elevated systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 have been reported in several COVID-19 patient cohorts and shown to correlate with disease severity (Mehta et al., 2020) . Increased IL-6 can also be associated with higher levels of IL-2, IL-7, IFN-\u0263 and GM-CSF as seen in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In response to viral infections, MNPs drive interleukin, and IFN-I and IFN-III production, resulting in inflammasome activation, induction of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cell responses, recruitment of effector immune cells and CRS pathology (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2020; Tanaka et al., 2016) . Independently, in vitro studies have demonstrated SARS-CoV-1 infection can induce intracellular stress pathways resulting in NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation and macrophage pyroptosis Shi et al., 2019) . Functional studies are required to implicate these myeloid inflammasome pathways in COVID-19 lung pathology and to assess other immunogenic pathways such as RIPK1/3-dependent necroptosis (Nailwal and Chan, 2019) . In conclusion, the strength and duration of myeloid interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signaling potentially dictate COVID-19 disease severity, but rigorous studies are warranted to confirm this.",

They are therefore able to induce the lysis of virus-infected cells that upregulate virus-derived proteins, as well as stress-inducible ligands, which are then recognized by NK cellactivating receptors, such as NKp46 (Cerwenka and Lanier, 2001; Draghi et al., 2007; Duev-Cohen et al., 2016; Glasner et al., 2012) . Future studies should investigate the expression of NK receptor ligands on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying NK cell activation in COVID-19 disease. Further, secretion of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Amanat et al., 2020) may induce CD56 dim CD16 + NK cell activation through Fc receptor recognition of antibodies, either bound to surface antigens expressed on infected cells or to extracellular virions as immune complexes ( Figure 2 ). This interaction might trigger both cytokine production by NK cells and lysis of infected cells through antibodymediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), as shown in influenza infection (Von Holle and Moody, 2019) . Emerging data highlight the capacity for NK-mediated ADCC in response to naturally isolated SARS-CoV-1 anti-S IgG that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein when transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Pinto et al., 2020) . These findings suggest that triggering NK cell activation may not only contribute to the resolution of infection, but also contribute to the cytokine storm in ARDS.",

Several pathways may contribute to the dysregulation of NK cells. While influenza virus infects NK cells and induces apoptosis (Mao et al., 2009) , lung NK cells do not express the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and are therefore unlikely to be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Travaglini et al., 2020) . The majority of NK cells found in human lung display a mature CD16 + KIR + CD56 dim phenotype and are able to induce cell cytotoxicity in response to loss of HLA class I or through Fc receptor signaling, although to a lower extent than their peripheral blood counterpart (Marquardt et al., 2017) . Killer-Immunoglobulin Receptors (KIRs) are acquired during NK cell development alongside CD16 (FcR\u03b3IIIA) and are essential for NK cell licensing and subsequent capacity for cytolytic function (Sivori et al., 2019) . Frequencies of NK cells expressing CD16 and/or KIR are decreased in the blood following SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 infection, respectively (Xia et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2020d) . Collectively, the data suggest either an impaired maturation of the NK compartment or migration of the mature, circulating NK cells into the lungs or other peripheral tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",

NKG2A inhibits cell cytotoxicity by binding the nonclassical HLA-E molecule (Braud et al., 1998; Brooks et al., 1997) , and this interaction is strongly correlated with poor control of HIV-1 infection (Ramsuran et al., 2018) . Genes encoding the inhibitory receptors LAG3 and TIM3 are also upregulated in NK cells from COVID-19 patients (Wilk et al., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020) . Thus, increased immune checkpoints on NK cells might contribute to viral escape. Additionally, COVID-19 patients have higher plasma concentrations of IL-6 , which significantly correlate with lower NK cell numbers . In vitro stimulation by IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor has previously revealed impaired cytolytic functions (perforin and granzyme B production) by healthy donor NK cells, which can be restored following addition of tocilizumab (IL-6R-blockade) (Cifaldi et al., 2015) . TNF-\u03b1 is also upregulated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients , and ligand-receptor interaction analysis of peripheral blood scRNAseq data suggests that monocyte-secreted TNF-\u03b1 might bind to its receptors on NK cells . TNF-\u03b1 is known to contribute to NK cell differentiation (Lee et al., 2009) , which includes downregulation of NKp46 (Ivagnes et al., 2018) , though no effect of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-6 on NK cell-mediated ADCC has been reported so far. Collectively, these data suggest that cross-talk with monocytes might impair NK cell recognition and killing of SARS-CoV-2infected cells, and antibodies targeting IL-6 and TNF-signaling may benefit enhanced NK cell functions in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 2 ).",

ILC2s are essential for the improvement of lung function following influenza infection in mice, through amphiregulin-mediated restoration of the airway epithelium and oxygen saturation (Monticelli et al., 2011) . However, ILC2s also produce IL-13, contributing to the recruitment of macrophages to the lung and influenza-induced airway hyperreactivity (Chang et al., 2011) . Indeed, ILCs are involved in the polarization of alveolar macrophages, either towards a M1-like phenotype (ILC1 and ILC3) or a M2like phenotype (ILC2) (Kim et al., 2018) .

The extent of lymphopenia -most striking for CD8 T cells in patients admitted to ICU -seemingly correlates with COVID-19-associated disease severity and mortality Diao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b Liu et al., , 2020c Tan et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020d Zeng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020c) . Patients with mild symptoms, however, typically present with normal or slightly higher T cell counts Thevarajan et al., 2020) . The cause of peripheral T cell loss in moderate to severe COVID-19, though a phenomenon also observed in other viral infections, remains elusive, and direct viral infection of T cells, in contrast to MERS-CoV (Chu et al., 2016) , has not been reported. Several mechanisms likely contribute to the reduced number of T cells in the blood, including effects from the inflammatory cytokine milieu. Indeed, lymphopenia seems to correlate with serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 (Diao et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020a) , while convalescent patients were found to have restored bulk T cell frequencies paired with overall lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels Diao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a Liu et al., , 2020b Zheng et al., 2020b) . Cytokines such as IFN-I and TNF-\u03b1 may inhibit T cell recirculation in blood by promoting retention in lymphoid organs and attachment to endothelium (Kamphuis et al., 2006; Shiow et al., 2006) . However, in an autopsy study examining the spleens and hilar lymph nodes of six patients who succumbed to COVID-19, Chen et al. observed extensive cell death of lymphocytes and suggested potential roles for IL-6 as well as Fas-FasL interactions . In support of this hypothesis, the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab was found to increase the number of circulating lymphocytes (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) . T cell recruitment to sites of infection may also reduce their presence in the peripheral blood compartment. scRNAseq analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of COVID-19 patients revealed an increase in CD8 T cell infiltrate with clonal expansion . Likewise, post-mortem examination of a patient who succumbed to ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection showed extensive lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs . However, another study that examined post-mortem biopsies from four COVID-19 patients only found neutrophilic infiltration (Tian et al., 2020a) . Further studies are therefore needed to better determine the cause and impact of the commonly observed lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Available information about SARS-CoV-1-specific T cell immunity may serve as an orientation for further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunogenic T cell epitopes are distributed across several SARS-CoV-1 proteins (S, N, M as well as ORF3), although CD4 T cell responses were more restricted to the S protein (Li et al., 2008) . In SARS-CoV-1 survivors, the magnitude and frequency of specific CD8 memory T cells exceeded that of CD4 memory T cells and virus-specific T cells persisted for at least 6-11 years suggesting that T cells may confer long-term immunity (Ng et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2011) . Limited data from viremic SARS patients further indicated that virusspecific CD4 T cell populations might be associated with a more severe disease course, since lethal outcomes correlated with elevated Th2 cell (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) serum cytokines (Li et al., 2008) . However, the quality of CD4 T cell responses needs to be further characterized to understand associations with disease severity. Few studies have thus far characterized specific T cell immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 12 patients recovering from mild COVID-19, robust T cell responses specific for viral N, M and S proteins were detected by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT, weakly correlated with neutralizing antibody concentrations (similar to convalescent SARS-CoV-1 patients (Li et al., 2008) , and subsequently contracted with only N-specific T cells detectable in about one third of the cases post recovery . In a second study, PBMCs from COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS were analyzed by flow cytometry, approximately 2 weeks after ICU admission (Weiskopf et al., 2020) . Both virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in all patients at average frequencies of 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, and very limited phenotyping according to CD45RA and CCR7 expression status characterized these cells predominantly as either CD4 Tcm (central memory) or CD8 Tem (effector memory) and Temra (effector memory RA) cells. This study is notable for the use of large complementary peptide pools comprising 1,095 SARS-Cov-2 epitopes (overlapping 15-mers for S protein as well as computationally predicted HLA-I-and -II-restricted epitopes for all other viral proteins) as antigenspecific stimuli that revealed a preferential specificity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells for S protein epitopes, with the former population modestly increasing over ~10-30 days after initial onset of symptoms. A caveat, however, pertains to the identification of specific T cells by induced CD69 and CD137 co-expression, since upregulation of CD137 by CD4 T cells, in contrast to CD154, may preferentially capture regulatory T cells (Treg) (Bacher et al., 2016) . Further analyses of S protein-specific T cells by ELISA demonstrated robust induction of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 concomitant with lower levels of IL-5, IL-13, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-22. A third report focused on S-specific CD4 T cell responses in 18 patients with mild, severe or critical COVID-19 using overlapping peptide pools and induced CD154 and CD137 co-expression as a readout for antiviral CD4 T cells. Such cells were present in 83% of cases and presented with enhanced CD38, HLA-DR and Ki-67 expression indicative of recent in vivo activation (Braun et al., 2020) . Of note, the authors also detected low frequencies of S-reactive CD4 T cells in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy control donors. However, these CD4 T cells lacked phenotypic markers of activation and were specific for C-terminal S protein epitopes that are highly similar to endemic human coronaviruses, suggesting that crossreactive CD4 memory T cells in some populations (e.g., children and younger patients that experience a higher incidence of hCoV infections) may be recruited into an amplified primary SARS-CoV-2-specific response (Braun et al., 2020) . Similarly, endemic CoV-specific CD4 T cells were previously shown to recognize SARS-CoV1 determinants (Gioia et al., 2005) . How previous infections with endemic coronavirus may affect immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 will need to be further investigated.",

This is suggested in a study by Zhou et al. which reported a significantly increased PBMC frequency of polyclonal GM-CSF + CD4 T cells capable of prodigious ex vivo IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 production only in critically ill COVID-19 patients . Of note, GM-CSF + CD4 T cells have been previously implicated in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and high levels of circulating GM-CSF + CD4 T cells were found to be associated with poor outcomes in sepsis . Additionally, two studies observed reduced frequencies of Treg cells in severe COVID-19 cases Qin et al., 2020) . Since Treg cells have been shown to help resolve ARDS inflammation in mouse models (Walter et al., 2018) , a loss of Tregs might facilitate the development of COVID-19 lung immunopathology. Similarly, a reduction of \u03b3\u03b4-T cells, a subset of T cells with apparent protective antiviral function in influenza pneumonia (Dong et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2013) , has been reported in severely sick COVID-19 patients Lei et al., 2020b) .",

            "text": "Currently, little is known about specific phenotypical and/or functional T cell changes associated with COVID-19. In the majority of preprints and peer-reviewed studies, there are reports of increased presence of activated T cells ( Figure 3 ) characterized by expression of HLA-DR, CD38, CD69, CD25, CD44 and Ki-67 (Braun et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020; Thevarajan et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020a; Zheng et al., 2020a) . Generally, independent of COVID-19 disease severity, CD8 T cells seem to be more activated than CD4 T cells Thevarajan et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020a) , a finding that echoes stronger CD8, than CD4, T cell responses during SARS-CoV-1 (Li et al., 2008) . Furthermore, in a case study of 10 COVID-19 patients, Diao et al. showed that levels of PD-1 increased from prodromal to symptomatic stages of the disease (Diao et al., 2020) . PD-1 expression is commonly associated with T cell exhaustion, but it is important to emphasize that PD-1 is primarily induced by TCR signaling; it is thus also expressed by activated effector T cells (Ahn et al., 2018) . In addition, several studies reported higher expression of various co-stimulatory and inhibitory molecules such as OX-40 and CD137 , CTLA-4 and TIGIT (Zheng et al., 2020a) , and NKG2a . Reduced numbers of CD28 + CD8 T cells as well as larger frequencies of PD-1 + /TIM3 + CD8 T cells in ICU patients were also reported . Expression of most of these markers was found to be higher in CD8 than in CD4 T cells, and levels tended to increase in severe vs. non-severe cases, which may be due to differences in viral load. Cellular functionality was shown to be impaired in CD4 and CD8 T cells of critically ill patients, with reduced frequencies of polyfunctional T cells (producing more than one cytokine) as well as generally lower IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production following re-stimulation with PMA and Ionomycin Zheng et al., 2020a Zheng et al., , 2020b . Similarly, Zheng et al. reported that CD8 T cells in severe COVID-19 appear less cytotoxic and effector-like with reduced CD107a degranulation and granzyme B (GzmB) production . In contrast, a different study found that both GzmB and perforin were increased in CD8 T cells of severely sick patients (Zheng et al., 2020a) . In accordance with the latter observation, when compared to a moderate disease group, convalescent patients with resolved severe SARS-CoV-1 infection had significantly higher frequencies of polyfunctional T cells, with CD4 T cells producing more IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2, and CD8 T cells producing more IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and CD107a, respectively (Li et al., 2008) . However, given the vigorous dynamics of acute T cell responses and potential differences in sample timing throughout disease course, these observations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Accordingly, RNAseq data by Liao et al. showed that CD8 T cells in the BAL fluid of severe COVID-19 patients express cytotoxic genes such as GZMA, GZMB, and GZMK at higher levels, while KLRC1 and XCL1 are enriched in mild cases . In summary, T cells in severe COVID-19 seem to be more activated and may exhibit a trend towards exhaustion, based on continuous expression of inhibitory markers such as PD-1 and TIM-3 as well as overall reduced polyfunctionality and cytotoxicity. Conversely, recovering patients were shown to have an increase in follicular helper CD4 T cells (T FH ) as well as decreasing levels of inhibitory markers along with enhanced levels of effector molecules such as Gzm A, GzmB and perforin (Thevarajan et al., Yang et al., 2020a; Zheng et al., 2020b) . Collectively, these studies provide a first glimpse into T cell dynamics in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, but any conclusions have to be tempered at this stage on account of significant limitations in many of the current investigations.",

Indeed, a case study of a single patient described induction of CD38 Hi CD27 Hi antibody secreting cells (ASCs), concomitant with an increase in circulating follicular T helper cells (Tfh) cells (Thevarajan et al., 2020) , and a scRNAseq study of PBMC from critically ill and recently recovered individuals revealed a plasma cell population .

A long-term study following 34 SARS-CoV-1 infected healthcare workers over a 13 years period also found that virus-specific IgG declined after several years, but the authors observed detectable virus-specific IgG 12 years after infection .

Despite these indications of a successful neutralizing response in the majority of individuals, higher titers are also associated with more severe clinical cases Okba et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020a) , suggesting that a robust antibody response alone is insufficient to avoid severe disease ( Figure 4 ). This was also observed in the previous SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, where neutralizing titers were found to be significantly higher in deceased patients compared to patients who had recovered . This has led to concerns that antibody responses to these viruses may contribute to pulmonary pathology, via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (Figure 4 ). This phenomenon is observed, when non-neutralizing virus-specific IgG facilitate entry of virus particles into Fc-receptor (FcR) expressing cells, particularly macrophages and monocytes, leading to inflammatory activation of these cells (Taylor et al., 2015) . A study in SARS-CoV-1-infected rhesus macaques found that anti-S-IgG contributed to severe acute lung injury (ALI) and massive accumulation of monocytes/macrophages in the lung . Furthermore, serum containing anti-S Ig from SARS-CoV-1 patients enhanced the infection of SARS-CoV-1 in human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro (Yip et al., 2014) . ADE was also reported with a monoclonal antibody isolated from a patient with MERS-CoV . Somewhat reassuringly, there was no evidence of ADE mediated by sera from rats vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro (Quinlan et al., 2020) , nor in macaque immunized with an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (Gao et al. 2020) .",

High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which may blunt ADE, has been trialed in COVID-19 patients Shao et al., 2020) , but further studies are needed to determine the extent to which IVIg is safe or beneficial in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine trials will need to consider the possibility of antibody-driven pathology upon antigen re-challenge; strategies using F(ab) fragments or engineered Fc monoclonal antibodies may prove particularly beneficial in this setting (Amanat and Krammer, 2020) .",

These studies are supported by previous observations on SARS-CoV-1 that followed the 2003 outbreak, which have identified significant associations between genetic variants and immune phenotypes (Chan et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011) . Although identifying such polymorphisms and their associated genes and pathways for SARS-CoV-2 will require large cohorts, several studies have already highlighted genetic polymorphisms that may potentially impact susceptibility, which remain to be tested in clinical trials. These studies have focused on genetic variants that may impact the expression or function of genes important in viral entry, namely ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (spike protein activator) (Asselta et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020c; Renieri et al., 2020; Stawiski et al., 2020) . Cao et al. identified variants that are potentially expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of ACE2 (i.e. they may potentially alter ACE2 gene expression) and analyzed their frequencies in different populations (Cao et al., 2020c) . Stawiski et al. listed variants that may be critical in ACE2 binding and thereby its function, and compared the frequencies of these variants within different populations (Stawiski et al., 2020) .",

This includes different acute phase proteins, such as SAA (serum amyloid protein) and C-reactive protein (CRP) . Interestingly, elevations in CRP appear to be unique to COVID-19 patients, when compared to other viral infections. Other consistently reported markers in non-survivors are increased procalcitonin (PCT) and IL-6 levels , as well as increased serum urea, creatinine, cystatin C, direct bilirubin, and cholinesterase . Overall, inflammatory markers are common in severe cases of COVID-19 and appear to correlate with the severity of the symptoms and clinical outcome.

Several cytokines and other immunologic parameters have been correlated with COVID-19 severity (Table 1) . Most notably, elevated IL-6 levels were detected in hospitalized patients, especially critically ill patients, in several studies, and are associated with ICU admission, respiratory failure, and poor prognosis (Chen et al., 2020f; Huang et al., 2020b; Liu et al., 2020f) . Increased IL-2R, IL-8, IL-10, and GM-CSF have been associated with disease severity as well, but studies are limited and further studies with larger cohorts of patients are needed to indicate predictive power Zhou et al., 2020b) . Conflicting results regarding IL-1\u03b2 and IL-4 have been reported Gong et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2020) . Although elevated cytokine concentrations have been widely described in COVID-19 patients, the vast majority (including IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, CTACK, IFN-\u03b3) do not seem to have prognostic value, because they do not always differentiate moderate cases from severe cases (Yang et al., 2020b) . This stratification was possible with IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra. While there are reports that levels of IL-6 at first assessment might predict respiratory failure (Herold et al., 2020) , other publications with longitudinal analyses demonstrated that IL-6 increases fairly late during the disease's course, consequently compromising its prognostic value at earlier stages .",

After SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 overexpressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal tracts and kidneys, increases in non-specific inflammation markers are observed. In more severe cases, a marked systemic release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines occurs, with corresponding worsening of lymphopenia and potential atrophy of lymphoid organs, impairing lymphocyte turnover (Terpos et al., 2020).",

Chen et al. conducted a multicenter, randomized priority trial on 240 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection to test favipiravir or arbidol . Favipiravir was suggested to significantly improve symptom relief. However, the interpretation of this study is limited by a short clinical recovery window of 7 days, only 100 of 236 patients with confirmed COVID-19, and the lack of a control group. LPV/r has previously shown efficacy in treating SARS-Cov-1 (Chu et al., 2004) , prompting an early SARS-Cov-2 clinical trial . 44 patients were enrolled in a trial investigating the efficacy and safety of LPV/r (n=21 patients), arbidol (n=16), or control (n=7) as treatment for mild-to-moderate COVID-19. At day 14 of treatment, 76.2%, 62.4% and 71.4% of patients had a positive to negative conversion in the LPV/r, arbidol, and control groups, respectively, with no statistical significance between groups. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 severe COVID-19 patients did not observe a significant benefit of LPV/r either (Cao et al., 2020a) . However, a study that looked at the impact of earlier administration of (LPV/r) treatment showed that when treatment of LPV/r was started within 10 days of symptom onset, a shorter duration of virus shedding was observed. Thus, timing of LPV/r administration may be critical to its efficacy .",

Both drugs are used as antimalarial agents and as immunomodulatory therapies for rheumatologic diseases. However, the application of CQ and HCQ to COVID-19 stems for their past use as antivirals (Savarino et al., 2003) , including for SARS-CoV-1 (Keyaerts et al., 2004; Vincent et al., 2005) . CQ and HCQ interfere with lysosomal activity and have been reported to have immuno-modulatory effects. CQ augments antigen processing for MHC class I and II presentation, directly inhibits endosomal TLR7 and TLR9, and enhances the activity of regulatory T cells (Garulli et al., 2008; Lo et al., 2015; Schrezenmeier and D\u00f6rner, 2020; Thom\u00e9 et al., 2013a Thom\u00e9 et al., , 2013b . Early studies involving in vitro infection of host cells with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that both CQ and HCQ significantly impact endosomal maturation, resulting in increased sequestration of virion particles within endolysosomes. However, there has been conflicting evidence whether CQ is more potent than HCQ in reducing viral load Yao et al., 2020a) . Notably, one group reported that treatment of infected cells with HCQ before and during infection significantly reduced viral load, suggesting that combined prophylactic and therapeutic HCQ use yields maximum efficacy (Clementi et al., 2020) . To better understand host immune responses to treatment, one group compared bulk transcriptomic changes in primary PBMCs treated with HCQ for 24 hours to PBMCs from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and controls, followed by a comparison of HCQ treated primary macrophages to BAL and postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 patients (Corley et al., 2020) . Across all comparisons, there was minimal overlap between host differential gene expression and genes altered by in vitro HCQ treatment. Thus, the potential mechanistic action of HCQ in the context of SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly defined.",

            "text": "Despite the apparent widespread use of HCQ and CQ to treat COVID-19 ( Figure 6B ), few controlled clinical trials have been performed so far and thus the potential benefits of these drugs for COVID-19 remains controversial. One of the earliest trials (2020-000890-25 ) was a single-arm, open label trial of 600mg daily HCQ in 20 COVID-19 patients. They reported that HCQ alone, or in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin (AZ), reduced viral load by day 6 (Gautret et al., 2020a) . A follow up trial in 80 patients treated with HCQ + AZ reported that 93% of patients had a negative PCR result on day 8 of treatment, and 81.3% were discharged within 10 days of treatment. However, it is important to note that both trials had no control arms (Gautret et al., 2020b) . Rigorous statistical analyses by others that accounted for the patients excluded from the original analysis found limited evidence for HCQ monotherapy (Hulme et al., 2020; Lover, 2020) . A double blind rRCT assessed HCQ monotherapy in the treatment of mild COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000029559) . A total of 62 patients were enrolled; the treatment arm received 400 mg HCQ daily over 5 days. By day 6, patients who received HCQ had clinical resolution on average one day earlier than controls; no patients progressed to severe disease compared to 4 patients in the control arm. In a smaller RCT treated 30 patients with mild COVID-19 (NCT04261517) with 400 mg HCQ for 7 days, there were no significant differences in the number of patients with negative PCR results on day 7 (all but one positive), median duration of hospitalization, time to fever resolution, or progression of disease on chest CT . The largest RCT to date enrolled 150 patients with mild COVID-19 across 16 centers in an open label trial of HCQ + standard of care (ChiCTR2000029868). There were no significant differences between groups in conversion to negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result on day 28 or rate of symptom resolution; there were significantly more adverse events in the HCQ arm, though largely non-serious; they reported some evidence for faster normalization of C-reactive protein in the patients who received HCQ plus standard of care, but this finding was not significant (Tang et al., 2020b) . A metaanalysis including most of the studies described here found no clinical benefits to patients receiving standard of care plus an HCQ regimen (Shamshirian et al., 2020) .",

An ongoing double blind RCT of patients with severe COVID-19 (NCT04323527) randomized 81 patients into high dose HCQ (600 mg 2x/d for 10 days) or low dose (450 mg/day for 5 days) treatment groups (Borba et al., 2020) .

Taken together, the clinical trials performed thus far to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ \u00b1 AZ for COVID-19 have not demonstrated clear evidence of clinical benefit in patients with severe disease. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov on April 27, 2020 found 140 clinical trials investigating HCQ.

In contrast, another retrospective analysis found that patients who received CS were more likely to have either been admitted to the ICU or perished, although the CS treated group also had significantly more comorbidities . A smaller observational study of 31 patients found no association between corticosteroid treatment and time to viral clearance, length of hospital stay, or symptom duration (Zha et al., 2020) . A larger study of adjuvant CS in 244 patients with critical COVID-19 found no association with 28-day mortality; subgroup analysis of patients with ARDS found no association between treatment with CS and clinical outcomes . They also found that increased dosage was significantly associated with increased mortality risk. A retrospective review of 46 patients, of whom 26 received IV methylprednisolone, found that early, low-dose administration significantly improved SpO2 and chest CT, time to fever resolution, and time on supplemental oxygen therapy (Wang et al., 2020h) . Others have published perspectives in support of early and short-term, low dose administration based on anecdotal evidence, but not clinical trials.

In contrast, type III IFN (also known as IFN\u03bb) signals mainly in epithelial cells, as well as in a restricted pool of immune cells.

One study of 40 patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection described unresolved elevated type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in those with poor outcomes (Cameron et al., 2007) . Others report that exogenous type I IFN does not improve outcomes when given with ribavirin in patients with MERS-CoV infection (Arabi et al., 2020) , suggesting that the role of IFN as a therapeutic or prophylactic option may be strain-or species-specific (Sheahan et al., 2020) . Interestingly, a recent study by Mount Sinai virology groups revealed that type I IFN signaling is impaired in the early response to SARS-CoV-2; in vitro, SARS-CoV-2 may be more susceptible to type I IFN than SARS-CoV-1 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) . Based on additional evidence that IFN responses to betacoronaviruses are altered as compared to other respiratory viruses (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Channappanavar et al., 2016; Okabayashi et al., 2006) , trials of IFN-I/III administration have been initiated (NCT04343976, NCT04331899).",

One group reported that in the context of generalized lymphopenia, certain subsets of CD4 T cells that express GM-CSF and IL-6 are more abundant in severe COVID-19 patients than in COVID-19 patients who do not require intensive care . Reports that other major proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u0263, IL-2) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4) are elevated underscore a potentially pathogenic T H 1/2 program in COVID-19 (Diao et al., 2020; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) . Histological and single-cell analyses identified monocytes/macrophages as other potent sources of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 cytokine storm Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Law et al., 2005; Moore and June, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b) .

The commercial anti-IL-6R antibodies tocilizumab (Actemra) and sarilumab (Kevzara), and the anti-IL-6 antibody siltuximab (Sylvant), are now being tested for efficacy in managing COVID-19 CRS and pneumonia in 13 ongoing clinical trials (Table  2 ). To date, only one group has reported preliminary results from a cohort of 20 COVID-19 patients treated with a single administration of tocilizumab (400 mg, IV), along with Lopinavir, methylprednisolone, and oxygen therapy (ChiCTR2000029765) . The single observation study found recuperated lymphocyte counts in 10/19 patients and resolution of lung opacities in 19/20 patients on chest CT; 19/20 patients were discharged. All patients experienced an improvement in symptoms, and no subsequent pulmonary infections were reported. A second report described an association between use of tocilizumab and reduced likelihood of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Still, in 30 declining patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, this retrospective study did not report significant improvement in mortality on weighted analysis (Roumier et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, these studies are encouraging but like other treatment approaches, larger RCTs are needed.",

In an effort to obtain these nAbs, scientists sorted RBD specific memory B cells and cloned their heavy and light variable region to express recombinant forms of the corresponding antibodies (Ju et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020) . Four of the antibodies produced in these studies (31B5, 32D4, P2C-2F6 P2C-1F11) showed high neutralizing potential in vitro, and all inhibited ACE2/RBD binding. Successful antibody-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be dependent on the inhibition of ACE2/RBD binding. However, Ye et al. 2020 showed that nearly all antibodies derived from serum of 26 recovered patients bound to S1 and RBD, with only 3 actually inhibiting ACE2/RBD binding . Of note, a SARS-CoV-1 derived neutralizing antibody (47D11) and a single chain antibody against SARS-CoV-2 (n3130) have also been shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 without inhibiting ACE2/RBD binding. Thus, blocking this interaction may not be a prerequisite for an effective SARS-CoV-2 nAb. The generation of a hybridoma producing a monoclonal nAb against SARS-CoV-2 provides the potential for a therapeutic Ab that can be directly administered to patients to block ongoing infection and potentially even as a prophylactic ( Figure 6D ).",

Thus, a wide range of SARS-CoV-1 nAbs have been tested for crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2, as they could help speed up the development of potential COVID-19 treatments. In a recent study, antibodies were isolated from the memory B cells of an individual who recovered from SARS-CoV-1 infection. While 8 out of 25 isolated antibodies could bind SARS-CoV-2 S protein, one of them (s309, see Table 3 ) also neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (Pinto et al., 2020) . The combination of s309 with a weakly neutralizing antibody that could bind another RBD epitope led to enhanced neutralization potency. In addition, CR3022 (Table 3 ) was found to bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD , but this antibody did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 . Computational simulations identified 3 amino-acids that could be modified on CR3022 to enhance its binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Corr\u00eaa Giron et al., 2020) , potentially augmenting its neutralization potential.",

In one study, the authors developed a protocol to synthetize human nanobodies, smaller antibodies that only contain a heavy variable (VH) chain as first described in camelids (Figure 6D ). Another antibody isolated from camelids immunized with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV S proteins then fused to a human Fc fragment showed neutralization potential against SARS-CoV-2 (VHH-72-Fc) (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Genetically modified mice with humanized antibody genes can also be used to generate therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, as successfully experimented against Ebola Virus (Levine, 2019) . Similar studies are now focused on the use of SARS-CoV-2 or derivatives to generate highly effective nAb in animal models, which can be directly given to infected patients, and efforts are already underway with estimates of clinical trials of pooled antibody cocktails beginning in early summer by Regeneron. Finally, another approach to nAb development is to fuse ACE2 protein and the Fc part of antibodies as they would bind RBD and potentially be cross reactive among other coronaviruses ( Figure 6D ). Indeed, an ACE2-Fc as well as an RBD-Fc have been shown to neutralize both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.",

These studies were neither controlled nor randomized, but they suggest that CP therapy is safe and can have a beneficial effect on the clinical course of disease. Further controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal timing and indication for CP therapy. CP therapy has also been proposed for prophylactic use in at-risk individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions or health care workers exposed to COVID-19 patients. The FDA has approved the use of CP to treat critically ill patients (Tanne, 2020) . Determining when to administer the CP is also of great importance, as a study in SARS-CoV-1 patients showed that CP was much more efficient when given to patients before day 14 day of illness (Cheng et al., 2005b) , as previously shown in influenza (Luke et al., 2006) .

The S protein has been found to induce robust and protective humoral and cellular immunity, including the development of nAbs and T cell-mediated immunity (Du et al., 2009) . In animal models, correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-1 infection appear to be induction of nAbs against the S protein, although antibodies to other proteins have been detected such as those against nucleoprotein (N) and ORF3a (Qiu et al., 2005; Sui et al., 2005) . nAbs are also believed to protect against infection by blocking receptor binding and viral entry, which has been shown with pseudovirus-based neutralization assays Nie et al., 2020a) . Studies of SARS-CoV-1 indicate that T cell responses, which were targeted to the S protein after natural infection, included CD8+ T cell responses against the membrane (M) and N proteins, may also be a correlate of protection and that memory T cell responses can persist even 11 years after infection (Li et al., 2008; Ng et al., 2016) . RBD-specific antiviral T cell responses have also been detected in people who have recovered from COVID-19, further validating its promise as a vaccine target (Braun et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020) .",

These findings are being translated into SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts, hastening the progress drastically. The WHO provided a report earlier in April that reported sixty-three vaccine candidates in preclinical testing and three in clinical testing (World Health Organization, 2020b) . A recent search on May 1, 2020, on ClinicalTrials.gov revealed ten registered vaccine candidates (Table 5 ). The University of Pittsburgh is also looking to move their microneedle array vaccine candidate containing a codon-optimized S1 subunit protein into clinical trials . Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) have recently reported their intent to collaborate and bring together Sanofi's baculovirus expression system, which is used to produce the influenza virus vaccine, Flublok, to create an S protein vaccine adjuvanted with GSK's AS03. The purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc) of Sinovac Biotech Ltd. will also be starting a clinical trial in China after finding that their candidate protected rhesus macaques from viral challenge without signs of detectable immunopathology . Although some of these vaccine candidates are based on platforms that have been used or tested for other purposes, there remain questions regarding their safety and immunogenicity, including the longevity of any induced responses, that will require continual evaluation.",

            "text": "Although the development of a vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection has progressed at an unprecedented rate and produced an impressive volume of candidates for testing, many challenges lie ahead. The prior knowledge gained after SARS-CoV-1 was first discovered in 2003 and the subsequent emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012 provided a significant jumpstart, but the progress of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development has already far outstripped the point of the blueprint created before COVID-19 became a pandemic. While a variety of platforms are simultaneously being innovated or adapted, they each have strengths and limitations, many of which relate to the delicate balance between safety and immunogenicity. Many shortcuts have been taken and will continue to be taken due to the urgency of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but significant concerns need to be addressed. One such concern involves the accumulating data supporting the initial assessment that COVID-19 is disproportionately severe in older adults. In conjunction with the large body of work related to immune-senescence, these findings indicate that vaccine design should take into consideration the impact of aging on vaccine efficacy (Nikolich-\u017dugich, 2018). Furthermore, questions remain regarding the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of COVID-19, with in vitro experiments, animal studies, and two studies of COVID-19 patients supporting this possibility (Cao, 2020; Tetro, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020a) . Assuming vaccine candidates are identified that can safely induce protective immune responses, additional major hurdles will be the production and dissemination of a vaccine. For some types of vaccines, large-scale production will not be as much of an issue and infrastructure already in place to produce current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)-quality biologics can be repurposed, but this will only be applicable to a subset of the candidates (Thanh Le et al., 2020) . In order to address the urgent need and stem the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory agencies need to continue to support rapid testing and progression of vaccine candidates, companies need to disseminate important findings directly and openly, and researchers need to investigate correlates of protection using in-depth immune monitoring of patients with a broad range of clinical presentations and clinical trial participants. The newly announced Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) is designed to bring together numerous governmental and industry entities to help address this need.",

Within months, there has been a significant generation of scientific knowledge that has shed some light on the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Studies of past coronavirus outbreaks, involving SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, have provided a foundation for our understanding. The pathology of severe cases of COVID-19 do indeed resemble certain immunopathologies seen in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections, like CRS. However, in many other ways, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are distinct from those seen with other coronavirus infections. The emerging epidemiological observation that significant proportions of individuals are asymptomatic despite infection, not only reflects our current understanding that SARS-CoV-2 has a longer incubation period and higher rate of transmission than other coronaviruses, but also speaks to significant differences in the host immune response. Therefore, it is imperative that immune responses against SARS-Cov-2 and mechanisms of hyperinflammation-driven pathology are further elucidated to better define therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.",

Preliminary data suggest that the antiviral function of these NK cells might be regulated through cross-talk with SARS-infected cells and inflammatory monocytes. A decrease in peripheral blood T cells associated with disease severity and inflammation is now well documented in COVID-19. Several studies report increased numbers of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells which display a trend towards an exhausted phenotype in persistent COVID-19, based on continuous and upregulated expression of inhibitory markers as well as potential reduced polyfunctionality and cytotoxicity. In severe disease, production of specific inflammatory cytokines by CD4 T cells has also been reported. This working model needs to be confirmed and expanded on in future studies to assess virus-specific T cell responses both in peripheral blood and in tissues.
