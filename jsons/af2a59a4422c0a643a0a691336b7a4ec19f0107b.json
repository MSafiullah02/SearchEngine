COVID-19 has spread by human-to-human transmission around the world quickly and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. 3 As of March 27, the populations of 199 countries worldwide have contracted the disease, with approximately 600,000 affected cases and 27,000 deaths (4.5% mortality rate). 4 The disease crisis has placed millions of people under quarantine as countries battle to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It also caused enormous economic, social, cultural, and even psychological damage to different sectors of society. 5 There are no antiviral treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 infections as of March 2020, and the production of safe and stable vaccines and effective drugs is a long process. 6 So, according to WHO, the best way to deal with COVID-19 infection is control and prevention. 7 However, given that the probable origin of COVID-19 has been animal consumption, it seems further efforts are needed. A logical next step must include implementation of stricter rules on food hygiene and food consumption in the world, which may prevent future crises.",
