The mean (95%CI) rehospitalisation rates increased from 9.3% (8.3-10.3%) by 7 days to 39.0% (22.0-59.4%) by 365 days. Infection was the most common rehospitalisation diagnosis. Risk factors that increased the rehospitalisation risk in sepsis survivors were generic characteristics such as older age, male, comorbidities, non-elective admissions, hospitalisation prior to index sepsis admission, and sepsis characteristics such as infection and illness severity, with hospital characteristics showing inconsistent associations.

In cohort studies, mainly from critically ill adults from high-income countries, sepsis diagnosis is increasing, and shortterm mortality is improving [3] [4] [5] . This epidemiology pattern results in increasing numbers of sepsis survivors, defined as patients who survive a sepsis-related hospitalisation. Among the numerous long-term ill health consequences observed in sepsis survivors, increased risk of rehospitalisation and long-term mortality [6] , when compared with non-sepsis hospitalisations and age-sex matched general population, are major challenges [7, 8] . Importantly, a proportion of this increased risk of rehospitalisation in sepsis survivors may be modifiable [9] .",

The second aim was to assess the independent risk factors for rehospitalisation using studies that report design features or analytic approach to control confounding [14, 15] , such as use of comparator populations, matching, restriction, stratification, and regression. The third aim was to assess how studies handled the competing risk of mortality in sepsis survivors, when rehospitalisation events are studied as the outcome of interest [10, 16, 17] .

Prior to finalising the literature strategy in October 2016, infection-related rehospitalisation was revised to a secondary outcome; the primary outcome was considered as all-cause rehospitalisation. However, this point was only updated in the PROS-PERO record prior to submission for peer review. At the screening stage, we considered any study design and included review articles and editorials accompanying original relevant studies. We also screened reference lists of included studies, related review articles, and editorials.",

The most relevant article was defined as the most recent full manuscript, if the data from the same patient cohort were reported as abstract or as an earlier full manuscript. Three authors (JW, RS, MSH) extracted data from the included studies and issues of uncertainty were resolved by consensus. We included full manuscripts and conference abstracts for estimating the timing and rate of rehospitalisation and only the full manuscripts for assessing rehospitalisation diagnoses, independent risk factors, and the competing risk problem. From each of the included studies, we extracted data on study design, number of patients, duration of follow-up, handling of loss during follow-up, description of index sepsis admission, rehospitalisation . The outcome of interest was all-cause rehospitalisation, which will be affected by a survivorship bias in the observed associations, as sepsis survivors are likely to be healthier than patients who die during the sepsis-related hospitalisation and b bias from competing risk as sepsis survivors also have a long-term risk of mortality. Shorter follow-up times in rehospitalisation studies preclude observation of outcome of interest (i.e., censored outcomes). A = Sepsis cohort starting from their index admission which may have greater risk of survivorship bias; B = Ideal cohort to address the research question; and C = Re-hospitalised survivor cohort all patients have the outcome of interest and there is limited understanding of the competing risk issue. Studies with non-sepsis controls provide an estimate the excess risk of rehospitalisation that is unique to sepsis [10, 87] events, rehospitalisation diagnoses, independent risk factors for rehospitalisation, and approach to competing risk of long-term mortality [8] . We classified risk factors as generic, sepsis-related, or hospital-related according to a previously used framework [6, 8] .",

The primary outcome of interest was all-cause rehospitalisation events in sepsis survivors following an index episode of sepsis, at follow-up time points as reported in studies. We recategorized the rehospitalisation-associated risk factors into generic, sepsis-specific, and hospitallevel factors. We included age, sex, ethnicity, rural or urban residence, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and comorbidity as generic risk factors. We included infection, septic shock status, acute illness severity including physiological disturbance, organ support, and organ dysfunction as sepsis-specific risk factors. We included hospital location (urban versus rural), university status (university-affiliated vs not), and other reported descriptions as hospital-level risk factors. We provide a descriptive comparison of risk factors included in analysis between studies and those risk factors identified as increasing the risk of rehospitalisation in sepsis survivors between studies. We performed random effect metanalysis of proportions (using metaprop package) [25] of cumulative rehospitalizations at 7, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days; between-study heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 , which is the percentage of between-study variation due to heterogeneity rather than chance, with values of 25%, 50%, and 75% indicating low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively [26] . We assessed small-study effects using Egger's test for 7-, 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365day proportions, when there were at least ten studies at a given time point. All analyses were done using Stata/MP 14.2 StataCorp College Station, Texas 77845, USA.",

Confounders for rehospitalisation risk factors were addressed with regression models in seventeen [12, 29, 33, 35, 36, 38-41, 45, 47, 50-52, 55, 56, 59] including competing risk models in two [38, 41] , matching in two [9, 49] , stratification in one [50] , and restriction in one [33] . Twenty-one studies were of low risk of bias and 15 studies were at moderate risk of bias for the primary outcome of rehospitalisation risk, as per modified Newcastle-Ottawa criteria (Table 1) .",

The mean rehospitalisation proportion (95% CI) at 30 days was 21.4% (17.6%, 25.4%; N = 36 studies reporting 6,729,617 patients; Fig. 3 ), at 7 days was 9.3% (8.3%, 10.3%; N = 5 studies reporting 475,312 patients), at 90 days was 38.1% (34.3%, 42.0%; N = 14 studies, 388,044 patients), at 180 days was 36.2% (30.7%, 41.8%; N = 7 studies, 107,293 patients), and at 365 days was 39.0% (22.0%; 57.4%; N = 5 studies, 10,286 patients). All estimates had high heterogeneity. We did not observe any small-study effects (eTable-1). Two studies that use competing risk models [38, 41] also had similar 30-day rehospitalisation rates (eFigure-1; test for heterogeneity between groups p = 0.08). There were no differences in 30-day rehospitalisation rates by risk of bias (eFigure-2; test for heterogeneity between groups p = 0.33). In studies with non-sepsis comparator populations, the 30-day rehospitalisation proportions in sepsis survivors were reported as either comparable to congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction [9, 29, 54] , or much higher than these and other similar acute medical conditions [33, 34, 39, 42, 55, 57] . The median (IQR) acute mortality among sepsis survivors who were re-hospitalised was 6.6% (4.6%, 8.7%; N = 8 studies) [12, 13, 29, 34, 36, 38, 39, 57] .",

This literature search resulted in a total of 12,544 records for our systematic review. 1 At screening stage, we included original articles, review articles, and editorials. The risk of bias was assessed on patient selection, ascertainment of exposure, and ascertainment of outcome domains using a modified Newcastle Ottawa Score (NOS) quality assessment checklist [23] . These domains account for bias with ascertainment, generalisability, measurement of exposure, measurement of risk factors, and selection. Comparability domain of NOS assessed whether excess risk of rehospitalisation in sepsis survivors was quantified and how confounders were considered during study design or analysis with techniques such as matching, restriction or regression models. Outcome domain of NOS assessed bias due to incomplete assessment of outcome or of competing risk outcomes such as mortality and due to censoring. Study-level risk of bias is then reported. Using this information, overall certainty of evidence was assessed as per GRADE system of assessment of evidence about prognosis (see main results) [24] EHR electronic health record, MC multi-centre, SC single-centre Table 2 ). The relationship between infection at index sepsis admission and the infection diagnosis at rehospitalisation was reported in one study as recurrent or unresolved in nearly 50% of cases [52] , often secondary to opportunistic pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida species in another study [55] , and same site as index sepsis admission in 68% of rehospitalisation events in another study [32] . Infection-related rehospitalisation was the most common rehospitalisation event in sepsis survivors. The median (IQR) 30-day event rate was 49.3% (38.0%, 61.2%) of the all rehospitalisation events in ten studies [12, 29, 34-36, 38, 47, 51, 52, 56] , with similar proportions reported at 90 days [37, 40] and 365 days [41] . Between one-third and two-thirds of rehospitalisation episodes in sepsis survivors were coded as sepsis [29, 32, 52] (Table 2) .",

Generic characteristics consistently highlighted as predictors for increased risk of rehospitalisation were increasing age, male sex, presence of one or comorbidities determined using either Charlson or Elixhauser comorbidity indices, non-white race, non-elective admissions, pre-index admission hospitalisation, and increased length of hospitalisation during index sepsis admission. Risk of rehospitalisation in sepsis survivors was increased when the discharge location was not to home following the index sepsis admission [13, 30, 34-36, 38, 51] . Among the sepsis-specific characteristics at index admission, infection features, organ dysfunction, and illness severity were identified as risk factors for rehospitalisation, especially when assessed with competing risk regression models [38, 41] . The type of infecting pathogen at index admission did not significantly alter the risk of rehospitalisation, with the exception of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria [59] . When risk factors for the same pathogen as index sepsis admission for rehospitalisation were evaluated, same pathogen was identified only in 25% of rehospitalisation and the major risk factors for same pathogen rehospitalisation were Gram-negative bacteria, urosepsis, and same site of infection [40] . Similar to all-cause rehospitalisation, the risk factors for infection-related rehospitalisation were older age, prolonged hospitalisation, and nursing home residence [55] . In three studies, infectionrelated rehospitalisation episodes were associated with greater risk of death [32, 52, 55] when compared to noninfection-related hospitalisations.",

Studies generally had broad inclusion criteria representative of the exposure of interest, sepsis, and, therefore, provided direct evidence. There was no evidence of publication bias. For rehospitalisation risk factors, the certainty of evidence is low due to inconsistency in risk factor definitions, imprecision in strengths of association, and risk of bias in many studies due to lack of competing risk models.",

The cumulative proportion of sepsis survivors re-hospitalised plateaus at 40% between 90 and 365 days, which may be related to competing risk of long-term deaths in sepsis survivors. Only two studies considered competing risk of long-term mortality when studying risk factors for rehospitalisation in sepsis survivors. The most common rehospitalisation diagnosis in sepsis survivors was infection. Uncertainties remain as to whether this represents a new infection or recurring infection from the index sepsis admission. Independent risk factors of rehospitalisation were most often time-invariant predictors like older age, male sex, higher comorbidity burden, and hospitalisation immediately preceding the index sepsis admission, and discharge to non-home location. Among the sepsis-specific risk factors, gastrointestinal site of infection, infection with ESBL bacteria, increasing illness severity, and longer hospital length of stay during index admission increased the risk of rehospitalisation. Other characteristics that increased rehospitalisation risk were lower socioeconomic strata, lower discharge haemoglobin, use of total parenteral nutrition, and tracheostomy at index sepsis admission. Hospital-level characteristics such as for profit and university status and sepsis volumes also influenced the risk of rehospitalisation in sepsis survivors, albeit inconsistently.",

We report the rehospitalisation rates at different timepoints over the first year following sepsis survival.

Although we excluded non-English language studies, this is unlikely to bias our results [80, 81] . We did not extract length of hospital stay data. The lack of any RCTs included in our systematic review may be related to the search strategy and screening criteria that focused on rehospitalisation events in sepsis survivors; we did not systematically examine all trials of septic patients to determine whether they reported rehospitalisation data. As the diagnostic codes are linked to hospital activity and remuneration, potential risk of bias from different coding practices cannot be ruled out. As our goal was to assess sepsis survivors' risk of rehospitalisation, we excluded related conditions such as pneumonia [82] which could potentially have provided additional information on rehospitalisation risk factors. In a systematic review of that specifically addressed rehospitalisation after pneumonia, the 30-day all-cause rehospitalisation rates in 12 studies were 11.6%, which is lower than sepsis survivor rates which we observed [83] . Interestingly, the 1-year rehospitalisation rates following pneumonia was 46%, which is compared to the sepsis survivor rates which we observed [83] . Higher rehospitalisation rates following pneumonia were noted in US-based cohorts and the common reasons for rehospitalisation following pneumonia in the study were pneumonia (5.6%) and worsening of cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities [83] . We planned our study before guidelines for systematic reviews assessing prognostic factors were published [84] . Most studies have assessed rehospitalisation risk using previous definitions of sepsis or using ICD codes to identify sepsis. Thus, our study highlights that rehospitalisation epidemiology with a more recent sepsis survivor cohort, based on the updated sepsis definitions, would be a valuable addition to the literature [1, 85] .",

These predictors have also been identified as risk factors for long-term mortality [6, 10] and are commonly available when sepsis survivors leave hospital. Therefore, a parsimonious prognostic risk score could be derived to stratify sepsis survivors based on their rehospitalisation risk, using their index sepsis admission variables. Our review also highlights the value of explicitly considering competing risk models in the analysis when assessing risk factors, as the cumulative rehospitalisation proportion plateaus after 90 days, potentially due to long-term mortality acting as competing event for rehospitalisation, especially in health care settings where community-level end-of-life or hospice care are more prevalent [18, 19] .",

Hospital sepsis case volume and critical care usage of sepsis patients influences subsequent rehospitalisation risk [36] . Furthermore, characteristics such as hospital size, university status, and serving a minority population appear to influence the risk of rehospitalisation. Thus, there is a need to assess the relative contributions of hospital-and patient-level predictors for this rehospitalisation risk, as reported for cardiovascular diseases [11] . These may provide opportunities for addressing this rehospitalisation problem with hospital-level quality-of-care interventions. For example, understanding how best to manage medical comorbidities in sepsis survivors [9] could alter the longterm risk of rehospitalisation and death.",
