Furthermore, compared to people living with HIV (PLH) in the US general population, incarcerated PLH are often less likely to have met HIV care continuum milestones [2, 3] \u2014engaged in care, received and adhered to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieved virologic suppression\u2014at the time of incarceration [4\u20137]. This disproportionate burden as well as the profound challenges in achieving the care continuum reflect how the incarcerated population represents one of the most socially and economically marginalized groups in the US [8\u201310]. Understanding the lived experience of navigating social and structural barriers to care in community settings may help us to improve the HIV care continuum among incarcerated PLH and those returning from custody.",

Their tool, the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS), has since been adapted to adults to measure various aspects of stability and predictability in daily life, ranging from a person\u2019s perceived ability to organize a routine and keep a schedule, to their sense of certainty regarding their future housing or source of income [12]. While life chaos remains an underexplored concept in the health literature, a limited number of studies have demonstrated that it predicts important health outcomes. Life chaos predicted missed appointments and poor medication adherence among PLH [12, 13] and patients with chronic illness, [14, 15] as well as risky sexual behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM) [16]. In addition, life chaos was associated with structural barriers to HIV care\u2014poverty, homelessness, and having unmet needs for financial, employment, and food support services\u2014supporting its validity [12, 13].",

They frequently experience poverty, comorbid substance use disorder [17, 18] housing instability [19], and social isolation from HIV-related stigma, all of which may contribute to life chaos [13, 16, 20]. Many come from communities where households and relationships are disrupted from high rates of incarceration [21]. Finally, social and economic marginalization due to overlapping stigmatized identities likely compound the life chaos. For example, incarcerated young black MSM often lose access to resources in their community due to homonegativity [22] and have higher rates of homelessness and lower rates of health insurance prior to incarceration compared to other incarcerated men [6]; transgender women experience discrimination in employment, healthcare and family settings and victimization while incarcerated [23, 24].",

Supportive social relationships have been shown to be positively associated with protective HIV-related behaviors, fewer HIV infections, and better HIV care continuum outcomes in general [26\u201330], including for incarcerated PLH [18, 31, 32]. Social support provides material resources or emotional support to buffer the effects of stressors [33, 34], and can potentially counter the effects of life chaos [16]. On the other hand, social relationships may also be a source of HIV-related stigma, the devaluation and discrimination of PLH, which can be a potent barrier to continuum of care outcomes [35, 36]. For PLH with criminal-justice involvement, HIV-related stigma is associated with hiding one\u2019s HIV serostatus, refusing to take ART, and relapsing into substance use [18, 31, 32, 37].",

To measure engagement in care, we asked whether participants who had been diagnosed more than 12 months prior to this incarceration had received at least one HIV primary care visit in the community 12 months prior to entering jail. We assessed ART adherence over the 30 days prior to incarceration using a scale of 0\u2013100% rating scale, generally called a Visual Analog Scale [40\u201342]. Finally, we defined virologic suppression as viral load < 400 copies/ml on first viral load after jail entry.

Routine HIV screening is critical not only for timely linkage to care and treatment for PLH, but also for reducing unrecognized transmission of HIV to others in the community [39]. HIV screening for those who are seronegative can also provide opportunities for risk assessment, counseling and further interventions such as pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent acquisition of HIV [59].",

While we do not know why this occurred in our study, one possible explanation may be that virologic suppression, especially when measured using a single measurement [60], is a downstream outcome that is not sensitive to the effects of upstream processes of engagement in care and adherence. Hence, life chaos may correlate with poor engagement in care and adherence to ART, but these processes may not be ultimately reflected in the viral load. First, virologic suppression is seen among patients with significant care gaps. In our study, among those who were diagnosed with HIV prior to this incarceration, 14% were engaged in care, while 68% were virologically suppressed. A recent study demonstrated a similar apparent discrepancy: a care gap of less than nine months had no association on viral load, and a gap of 12 months or more resulted in a quarter of previously suppressed patients becoming unsuppressed [61]. One explanation for this observation is that patients continue to take ART despite not engaging in care: a recent study based on a billings claim database showed that 40% of people with care gaps over six months continued to fill their ART prescriptions [62]. Furthermore, studies have shown that moderate levels of adherence as low as 75% can lead to virologic suppression [63\u201365]. Finally, reincarceration is common [66]. It is possible that participants received care and took ART during a previous jail stay within the 12 months prior to the current incarceration, and this may not have been reflected in the survey results.",

The perception that the future is uncertain is a central component of life chaos; similarly, time preference theory proposes that those who perceive that the future is uncertain are less likely to engage in healthy behaviors, because they do not value the potential health benefit in the future [67]. If chaos in effect measures future uncertainty, the association we found between chaos and HIV testing, engagement in care, and ART adherence may reflect our participants\u2019 lack of perceived benefit of these health-promoting activities. Another conceptually similar measure, stressful life circumstances (such as employment difficulties and major financial problems) predicted poor ART adherence [68]. Finally, life chaos has been closely linked to underlying poverty [13] as well as with unmet needs in housing, finances, employment, and food security [12, 58]. Prior studies showed that incarcerated PLH who are homeless [2, 69] or otherwise have difficulty meeting basic needs [57, 70] are less likely to receive routine HIV care. Homelessness [66, 69] and food insecurity have been associated with poor ART adherence [3], while employment has been associated with increased adherence [2] for incarcerated PLH.",

The data on HIV testing, engagement in care, and ART adherence are self-reported, and therefore subject to the challenges inherent to all studies using self-reported data. We did not collect data on prior incarceration.

At the individual level, our findings demonstrate the potential benefit of novel approaches to understand and address life chaos for PLH who experience incarceration in order to achieve HIV care continuum goals. Health care providers may identify patients who show signs of life chaos, such as having difficulty keeping their appointments or reluctance to schedule their next appointment, and offer supportive services, especially if they have experienced incarceration. Providers could partner with peer navigators or community health workers who may assist PLH in managing their life chaos, such as by scheduling or reminding them of their appointments or organizing transportation [38], thereby making health care a source of stability in their lives. It will be critical to identify and address life chaos among PLH prior to their arriving in jail. It will be important to examine whether interventions that target the underlying factors associated with life chaos, such as housing, food, and income will change the perceptions of insecurity and uncertainty among vulnerable people, and also lead to better continuum of care outcomes in well-designed prospective studies. At the community level, this may include addressing incarceration stigma\u2014shame and discrimination of people who experience incarceration [57, 73, 74]\u2014as this has been found be to a barrier for formerly incarcerated PLH to accessing care and other resources, such as housing, employment, and educational opportunities.",
