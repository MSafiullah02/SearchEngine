Although stochastic models of viral evolution may potentially be informed by such data, a major challenge lies in deciding which mobility processes are critical and to what extent they contribute to shaping contemporaneous distributions of pathogen diversity. Here, we develop a framework to integrate predictors of viral diffusion with phylogeographic inference and estimate human influenza H3N2 migration history while simultaneously testing and quantifying the factors that underly it. We provide evidence for air travel governing the global dynamics of human influenza whereas other processes act at a more local scale.",

Indeed, air travel represents an obvious driving force for the global circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and may explain the absence of locally persistent strains in between epidemic seasons [3] . Retrospective modeling of the 1968 'Hong Kong flu' pandemic spread demonstrated that the H3N2 virus diffused through a network of global cities interconnected by air travel [4] . Numerous modeling studies have subsequently examined the influence of air travel on influenza spread (e.g. [5, 6, 7, 8] ), but far less work has attempted to verify such models against underlying patterns of host movement [9] .",

Using weekly time series of excess mortalities between 1972 and 2002, [9] demonstrated that the patterns of timing and incidence across the continental United States are significantly associated with euclidean distance and various measures of domestic transportation (including airline travel), but most strongly with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces. In the same year, Brownstein et al. (2006) [10] demonstrated that the rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the United States, as measured using weekly influenza and pneumonia mortality statistics from 1996 to 2005, is predicted by domestic airline travel volume in November. Because both studies implicated a different key driver of seasonal influenza spread across the United States, the findings were subject of debate [11] , in particular in the light of a mounting threat of an influenza pandemic [12, 13] and the need for decisions on implementing travel restrictions. Insights at the global scale are also revealed by simulation studies (e.g, [14] ), and empirical analysis using global mortality data may prove even more challenging.",

The power of fitting statistical models of evolution to observed sequence data has clearly been demonstrated by a number of seminal studies, e.g. by revealing the genetic dynamics of influenza A H3N2 seasonality [15] and spatial patterns of global H3N2 circulation [3, 16] . More generally, viral phylogenetic and epidemiological insights have culminated into a phylodynamic framework that unifies evolutionary and ecological dynamics to explain patterns of viral diversity [17] . Although model-based inference is increasingly used to reconstruct viral diffusion through time and space, these attempts typically fit parameter-rich models to sparse spatial data, and post-hoc interpretation of phylogeographic patterns are then difficult to relate directly to underlying ecological and evolutionary processes [18] .",

By parameterizing the discrete diffusion process in terms of the inclusion and contribution of predictors, our approach generally requires considerably fewer parameters compared to standard phylogeographic inference. We demonstrate how this model allows for the integration of viral genetic data and human mobility measures to draw inference about key drivers of global influenza dynamics.",

We explored different spatial and air travel-assisted subdivisions with subsampling to examine the impact of discrete sampling allocation and sample numbers per locations on our phylogeographic estimates. In an attempt to include all sequence data while keeping the number of samples per location as balanced as possible, we first divided all the sequences into 26 geographic regions (Table 1 ).

Modularity provides a measure of how well the connectivity of a network is described by partitioning its nodes into non-overlapping groups. For any given partition, modularity will be high if connectivity within groups is high and connectivity among groups is low. In large networks, it is generally computationally impossible to find the optimal subdivision. To approximate the optimum a variety of approximative methods have been introduced. The method we employ here generates an ensemble of high modularity subdivisions and computes the consensus in this ensemble by superposition, for details see [20, 22] . For an ensemble of 1000 modularity subdivisions we quantify the uncertainty by an affinity matrix that, for each pair of locations, summarizes the fraction of partitions in which these locations are in the same community. Based on a partition encompassing a reasonably large number of air communities (n = 14), we subsequently obtain the average affinity for each airport to the communities in this partition. We assign each airport to the community for which it shows the highest average affinity, but we take into account its uncertainty by also considering assignments that yield affinities that are > 2/3 of the highest affinity score. This cut-off resulted in 771 ambiguous airport assignments. Finally, we partitioned the sequence data according to the air community assignment and accommodate 368 (24%) ambiguous sequence locations, i.e. those sequences related to airports with ambiguous community assignments, using ambiguity coding in our phylogeographic approach.",

Taiwanese surveillance data was obtained from [40] . We focused on the influenza A(H3) incidence counts between 2002 -2007 or as close as possible to this time period when insufficient data was available. Average incidence counts were used when data from multiple countries per region/community was available.

The origin incidence versus destination growth rate sums the product of origin incidence and destination growth rate for each week of the year. Peak time difference quantifies the difference in peak incidence for each origin-destination pair. For the latter, we summarized the donor incidences at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks prior to peak incidence in the destination location as potential predictors. \u2022 Antigenic evolution. Because antigenic evolution can provide insights into the seeding dynamics of seasonal H3N2 [3] , we sought to include the average antigenic divergence for each region as phylogeographic diffusion predictors. Based on the available antigenic cartography data for the strains in our phylogeographic analyses, we performed a local regression (LOESS) of the principle antigenic component, obtained from a multidimensional scaling analysis of hemagglutination inhibition assay measurements [3] , against time. The resulting scatter plot with strains colored according to air community is presented in Figure 2 . Distances from the spline (residuals) were calculated for each antigenic measurement and average residuals were obtained for each region/community, which reflects whether a location is on average antigenically leading or trailing [3] . These average residuals are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3. We considered the exponentiated residual and exponentiated negative residual as a measure of efflux and influx respectively for each location and included these as separate origin and destination predictors.",

The main limiting factor in Bayesian MCMC analysis of evolutionary history is typically the efficiency with which topology proposals sample phylogenetic tree space [41] . To side-step these limitations and reduce time to convergence, we seek to approximate phylogenetic uncertainty in our phylogeographic estimates in cases where sampling tree space needs to be performed repeatedly (e.g. when comparing different diffusion models). To this purpose, we follow [42] and implement proposal mechanisms to randomly draw from an empirical posterior distribution of trees, which, in our case, were solely inferred from sequence data. Because the likelihood of a tree topology will largely be dominated by an informative sequence alignment compared to a single discrete (location) site, we expect such an empirical distribution to closely approximate the phylogenetic uncertainty in the joint inference approach.",

We discretized the global sampling locations into 26 and 15 geographically defined regions (Table 1 and 2 respectively) as well as into 14 distinct air travel communities (Table 3) . To identify this community structure in global air travel, we determined partitions with high intra-module connectivity and low inter-module connectivity in a passenger flux network of 1227 airports. Although this approach is blind to the geographic locations of the airports, the global air communities are spatially compact with few exceptions (Figure 3) .",

When applied to 26 geographic regions, which further partitions geographically and administratively coherent regions like US, China, Japan and Australia (Table 1) , our model also takes an important negative contribution from geographic distance and, correlated with this but with lower coefficients, population densities. Here, distance most likely represents the role of other human mobility processes such as commuting, which has been shown to play a key role in the spread of influenza in the US [9] .

The predictors of influenza diffusion will undoubtedly be scale-dependent as indicated by the role of geographic distance within more confined geographic areas (Figure 4) , and this may represent other forms of human mobility such as commuting [9] , which can be tested in future applications.
