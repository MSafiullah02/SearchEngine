            "text": "Feline uveitis, which is a common ocular condition, is usually divided into exogenous and endogenous causes.1 Exogenous causes are commonly identified by a thorough ocular examination and include trauma, corneal ulcers, and lens luxations. Endogenous causes, which are the most common cause of uveitis in cats, tend to be divided into large categories, including infectious, neoplastic, and immune\u2010mediated or idiopathic.2 The most commonly reported infectious agents associated with feline endogenous uveitis are feline leukemia virus (FeLV),3, 4 feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV),5, 6 feline coronavirus (FCoV) causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP),4, 7 bartonellosis,8, 9 toxoplasmosis,10, 11 and systemic fungal infections, including cryptococcosis,12, 13 histoplasmosis,14 blastomycosis,15 and coccidioidomycosis.16, 17 The most common primary neoplastic cause of uveitis is iris melanoma, followed by trauma associated sarcoma, while the most common metastatic neoplasia is lymphoma.2, 18\n",

While neoplasia may be diagnosed based on appearance and confirmed with cytology of aqueous humor or biopsies, aqueous humor cytology is generally not as beneficial in definitively diagnosing infectious agents.19 Therefore, a thorough physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, and select serological titers are recommended in many cases of endogenous uveitis to narrow down the differential list.20 In addition, despite their inability to definitively diagnose the cause of endogenous uveitis, aqueous humor serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still methods used to investigate possible causes, including Bartonella spp, T. gondii, FCoV, and feline herpesvirus\u20101 (FHV\u20101). Aqueous humor serology and PCR results, as well as serum serology, must be interpreted carefully, as serology usually indicates exposure, not active infection, and the high sensitivity of PCR can make it difficult to determine whether an infection is active.21\n",

A more recent study investigating the diagnostic quality of aqueous humor serology, found similar results, in that 40% of cats with uveitis had serum that was serologically negative for FeLV, FIV, Toxoplasma, and Bartonella spp.21 One study published in 1991, that focused specifically on cats presenting to ophthalmologists in North Carolina, found infectious agents caused 15% of uveitis cases, neoplasia caused 13%, and systemic hypertension caused 2%. The remaining 70% of cases were deemed idiopathic.22 With the advance of new diagnostic tests and a greater awareness of possible etiologic agents, the purpose of this study was to investigate the causes of feline endogenous uveitis in North Carolina by reviewing the medical records of cats diagnosed with endogenous uveitis at referral ophthalmology clinics in North Carolina.",

Finally, in most instances, serology was the only diagnostic performed to test for T. gondii and Bartonella spp., while histopathology, bacterial cultures, and PCR were more rarely completed. Interpreting the clinical significance of seropositivity for T. gondii and Bartonella spp. is difficult.

This was demonstrated by one study which found that only 2% of cats infected with FeLV had clinical signs of ocular disease.3 None of the cats in this present study that were diagnosed with FeLV had evidence of lymphoma, and likewise, none of the cats diagnosed with lymphoma were seropositive for FeLV, although one of the three cases diagnosed with lymphoma was not tested for the retrovirus. This makes interpreting the results of the FeLV seropositivity difficult, but it is likely that the positive results are incidental findings.",

In addition, a full necropsy was performed on 7 (5.0%) additional cats that had lesions consistent with FIP and were diagnosed as confirmed FIP, for a total of 19.4% of feline uveitis cases being either suspected or confirmed FIP.4 While that study had a biased toward severely damaged eyes requiring enucleation or cats with serious or fatal systemic diseases, our findings of 15.8% of cases being diagnosed with FIP is similar, and much higher than 2.2% of cases reported in the same region in 1991.22 The average age of patients diagnosed with FIP in this study was 1.82 years, compared to the overall average of 7.62 years. Given the high percentage of cases diagnosed with FIP in this study, it is recommended that the minimal diagnostics for young cats presented with uveitis include FCoV serology and bloodwork to evaluate for hyperglobulinemia, which is reported in 50\u201070% of felines with FIP.49\n",

Given that almost 50% of cats with newly diagnosed lymphoma have ocular abnormalities,50 and a similar study from the same region performed in 199122 reported that 5.7% of cats presenting with uveitis were diagnosed with lymphoma, the number of cats diagnosed with lymphoma in this study was lower than expected. Considering that multiple types of neoplasia can present as focal growths and are possible to tentatively diagnose with a basic ophthalmic exam, it is possible that fewer patients with ocular neoplasia were referred. 51 Therefore, neoplasia, especially in older patients, as the average age of patients diagnosed with neoplasia in this study was 11.1 years, should still remain high on the differential list as a cause of uveitis.",

Cryptococcus neoformans,\n12, 13\nHistoplasma capsulatum,\n14\nBlastomyces dermatiditis\n15 and Coccidiodes immitis\n16, 17 have all been known to cause uveitis in feline patients. In this study, nine patients were tested for fungal disease, and one was diagnosed with cryptococcosis. The fact that only nine patients were screened for fungal disease is likely due to a combination of factors, one being that fungal agents tend to cause characteristic ocular lesions including granulomatous keratic precipitates, hypopyon, and granulomas within the retina and choroid, and often retinal detachment. In addition, most cats with uveitis from fungal agents are systemically ill, and therefore, a diagnosis is often made by identifying the fungal organisms at an extraocular site.2, 18 Therefore, despite the low number of tests, it is unlikely that this study underestimated the number of fungal uveitis cases. However, in areas where fungal disease is more common, including the southwestern United States or the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi river valleys, screening for fungal disease could be of further benefit in diagnosing the cause of endogenous uveitis.",

Additionally, case reports have documented other, rarely diagnosed, causes of uveitis, including aberrant larval migration of Cuterebra spp.,53, 54 leishmaniasis,55 and mycobacteriosis.56 Given that there are multiple causes of endogenous uveitis and the retrospective nature of this study, it is likely that some of the cases ruled idiopathic in this study actually had an infectious cause.",

In total, a definitive diagnosis was achieved in 30.8% of cases (37 cats), associated with neoplasia, FIP, FIV, FeLV, and cryptococcosis, and 40.8% of cases were ruled idiopathic. Finally, 29.2% (35 cases) of patients were seropositive for Bartonella spp, or T. gondii, or both and did not fit into either the definitively diagnosed cases or the truly idiopathic cases. This information should help guide client education on the benefits of pursuing initial diagnostics to find a definitive cause, which will likely be achieved one\u2010third of the time. In addition, if toxoplasmosis or bartonellosis are not highly suspected, serology is a valuable test to rule out these diseases, as in this study only 23.7% of cats tested for T. gondii, and 43.2% of cats tested for Bartonella spp. were seropositive. This strategy would help avoid the expense and risks of unnecessary antibiotics and further diagnostic tests. If bartonellosis and toxoplasmosis are highly suspected, more definitive diagnostic tests, such as biopsies and histopathology for T. gondii and bacterial isolation for Bartonella spp., should be pursued. In addition, the most commonly diagnosed infectious disease was FIP (15.8% of cases). Therefore, especially in younger cats, FCoV serology and bloodwork should be performed to investigate FIP as the cause of uveitis. The occurrence of neoplasia in this study was lower than expected at 5.0%, but should remain as a differential, especially in older patients.",
