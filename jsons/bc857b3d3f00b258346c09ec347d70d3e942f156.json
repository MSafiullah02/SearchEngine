[1] Particulate vaccines have been engineered with virus-mimicking features-including nanoscale morphology, [2] multivalent antigen display, [3] and antigen/adjuvant colocalization [4] -to promote immune cell engagement and antigen processing. However, reliable coupling of antigen and danger signals in a virus-like fashion remains challenging at the nanoscale as the task demands stable adjuvant compartmentalization in functionalizable nanocarriers for antigen association. We herein demonstrate a viral capsid-like hollow polymeric nanoparticle encapsulating an emerging class of STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist adjuvant as a viromimetic vaccine platform. Consisting of a thin shell of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with a large aqueous core, the hollow nanoparticles stably entrap the soluble adjuvant for antigen conjugation and storage. Owing to the acid-sensitive PLGA hydrolysis, the nanoparticles readily release the adjuvant upon cellular uptake, facilitating immune activation and antigen recognition. To our knowledge, the present work is the first report of a PLGA-based hollow nanocarrier capable of adjustable encapsulation and controlled release of STING agonists for vaccine development.",

            "text": "Localized at the endoplasmic reticulum, STING is a potent inducer of type I interferons (IFNs) typically activated upon intracellular infection. [5] Following stimulation by cytosolic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), STING activates IRF3 and NF\u03baB, which in turn upregulate the expression of type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines to shape the adaptive immunity. [5b,6] The well-defined immune activation mechanism of CDNs has made them a desirable adjuvant candidate for improving vaccine potency. However, free CDNs are not readily membrane-permeable, and their systemic distribution may trigger undesirable reactogenic effects. [7] In addition, given that type I IFNs are pleiotropic and can undermine immune responses upon out-of-sequence antigen presentation, [8] CDN delivery is preferably synchronized with target antigens for optimal immune potentiation. While multiple formulations have been prepared for CDN delivery, [9] their shortcomings ranging from poor encapsulation efficiency, size limitation, and carrier instability leave much room for carrier improvement. In light of these considerations, we demonstrated that the hollow polymeric nanoparticles can encapsulate tunable levels of cdGMP at a high efficiency and improve the compound's potency and safety. Surface functionalization of the nanoparticles was mediated by incorporation of DSPE-PEG-maleimide in the polymeric shell, which allowed for further antigen conjugation for vaccine preparations ( Figure 1A ). In the present study, a vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was prepared based on the viromimetic design.",

[10] Since its first isolation from a fatal Saudi patient in 2012, there has been continuous outbreaks with more than 2000 reported cases across 27 countries and a mortality rate of 35%. The \u03b2-coronavirus is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), with dromedary camels as the primary reservoir host for human infection. [11] Currently, no effective therapeutic or prophylactic measure is available against the disease, and MERS-CoV vaccine development remains a global health priority identified by the World Health Organization (WHO). While several virus-based vaccines have been explored, [12] major efforts on MERS-CoV vaccine research are devoted to subunit candidates such as MERS-CoV spike protein and its derivatives, S1 protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) for safety and logistical considerations. [13] Ongoing challenges remain, however, as observation of vaccination-induced pulmonary immunopathology in immunized and challenged hosts raises concerns over the use of traditional, Th2-dominant adjuvants. [14] In addition, with cellular immunity being an increasingly recognized component alongside neutralizing antibodies for durable protection against the mutation-prone virus, [15] MERS-CoV vaccines may benefit from technologies that can effectively promote both humoral and cellular immune responses.",

In comparison to formulations that contain soluble antigens and adjuvants, inoculation with the nanoparticle (NP)-based vaccine induced greatly enhanced antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses in immunized mice. We further demonstrated that immunization with this NP-based MERS-CoV vaccine confers the protection against lethal MERS-CoV challenges in highly MERS-CoV-permissive transgenic mice globally expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a functional MERS-CoV receptor. As the viromimetic nanoparticles are comprised entirely of biocompatible materials, this synthetic approach not only affords a safe and viable strategy in bridging the effectiveness between subunit and virus-based vaccines, but also provides a robust and versatile platform toward addressing the public health demand for vaccine development.",

            "text": "The capsid-like hollow nanoparticles were prepared using a double emulsion process with 10 000 Da PLGA. Characterizations by cryo-EM and the dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed that the hollow nanoparticles had a shell thickness of \u224810 nm and a unimodal particle distribution with an average diameter of 114.0 nm ( Figure 1B-D) . A large aqueous interior could be observed, and successful encapsulation of cdGMP was verified by HPLC ( Figure 1E ). On the other hand, no peak of nanoparticleassociated cdGMP was detected after directly mixing hollow nanoparticles with cdGMP, indicating there is no interaction between the nanoparticle and the adjuvant ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information). With different cdGMP input, loading efficiency was consistent at approximately 48% ( Figure 1F ). This result indicates consistent partitioning of cdGMP solutions inside the hollow nanoparticles regardless of cdGMP concentration, thereby enabling controllable adjuvant loading for vaccine development. The cdGMP-loaded nanoparticles (NP(cdGMP)) are highly robust as little adjuvant release was observed over an extended period of time upon storage in enclosed Eppendorf tubes at 4 \u00b0C and room temperature ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information). In a dialysis experiment at 37 \u00b0C, (NP(cdGMP)) slowly released the adjuvant in a sustained manner at pH 7.4 but had a burst release profile at pH 5. This pH-sensitive release kinetics could be attributed to the acid-labile ester hydrolysis of PLGA under acidic conditions ( Figure 1G ). The release profile is favorable for vaccine delivery as the nanoparticles can retain their content upon administration and unload their cargoes once entering the acidic endolysosomal compartment following cellular uptake.",

Unlike these previously reported formulations, a double-emulsion process is adopted in the present work to facilitate the incorporation of water-soluble, nonionizable compounds. Upon adjusting the double emulsion parameters, we observed that the molecular weight of the polymer is critical to the hollow nanostructure formation. Preparations with 40 000 Da PLGA yielded solid particles or particles with miniscule aqueous interior as observed under cryoEM ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information), which are consistent with prior reports on double-emulsion-based PLGA nanoparticles. [18] These particles had poor cdGMP loading, which is also in agreement with previous, unsuccessful efforts on emulsion-based STING agonist encapsulation [9b] and reflect the long-standing challenge in nanoencapsulation of nonlipophilic compounds. [19] Successful preparation of the capsid-like hollow nanoparticles was made possible with the 10 000 Da polymer, which exhibits significantly lower viscosity in organic solvent as compared to the high-molecular-weight polymer ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information). Given the correlation between solution viscosity and surface tension, [20] it can be reasoned that double emulsions with the low-molecular-weight polymer solution had reduced interfacial surface tensions, thereby contributing to more stable core-shell structures and highly efficient incorporation of the cdGMP solution.",

To assess the immune potentiating functionality of the nanoparticulate STING agonists, we first compared cdGMP and NP(cdGMP) in in vitro studies with murine dendritic cell (DC)-like JAWS II cells. JAWS II cells have been widely used in immunological studies due to their ease of preparation compared to primary dendritic cells. [21] Though slightly less responsive, JAWS II cells exhibit similar phenotypic markers and functions to bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). [22] Using a fluorescently labeled cdGMP, we noted that the cellular uptake of water soluble STING agonist was greatly increased when it was encapsulated in the hollow nanoparticles (Figure 2A) , concomitant with an increase in the induction of cytokines, including IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 ( Figure 2B ). The capability of cdGMP and NP(cdGMP) in inducing DC maturation was further confirmed by examining the upregulation of costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, on BMDCs. At an equivalent adjuvant dosage (1 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ), NP(cdGMP) significantly enhanced CD80 expression on BMDCs compared to free cdGMP ( Figure 2C ). These data indicate that the NP(cdGMP) is superior to free cdGMP in triggering host immune responses, in part, due to its more efficient uptake by professional antigenpresenting cells.",

The mice treated with NP(cdGMP) had prominent levels of IFN-\u03b2 within the draining lymph nodes ( Figure 2D ), yet TNF-\u03b1 in the circulation was significantly subdued as compared to mice receiving free cdGMP ( Figure 2E ). The later observation likely indicated that the free cdGMP rapidly diffused into the blood stream upon administration, subsequently causing unfavorable systemic inflammatory responses. These data suggest that NP(cdGMP) can preferentially target the lymphatic system (i.e., draining lymph nodes), prompting localized immune activation while reducing systemic reactogenicity.",

After purification by FPLC, the identity of RBD protein was initially verified by its size at approximately 37 kDa with SDS-PAGE followed by the Western blot analysis with MERS-CoV-specific polyclonal antibody ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information). To facilitate RBD coupling with NP(cdGMP), the nanoparticles were prepared with DSPE-PEG-maleimide in the outer aqueous phase. Incorporation efficiency of the surface linkers was approximately 70%, yielding NP(cdGMP) with \u22483000 maleimide linkers per particle with negligible influence on cdGMP encapsulation efficiency ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information). A sulfhydryl-reactive cross-linker chemistry was adopted to conjugate the endogenous cysteine residues in RBD proteins to nanoparticle surfaces. Following the protein conjugation, the size of nanoparticles increased from 114.0 to 148.8 nm, and the zeta-potential shifted from \u221262.6 to \u221218.2 mV (Figure 3C ). The polydispersity index (PDI) remained constant before and after protein conjugation, with a mean at 0.153 and 0.152, respectively ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information). Quantification by BCA assay showed that RBD-conjugated nanoparticles (RBD-NP(cdGMP)) contained \u224870% of the antigen input, or \u224811.2 \u00b5g of RBD per mg of PLGA. With approximately 1 \u00d7 10 12 particles per mg of PLGA, this corresponds to \u2248250 protein antigens per particle ( Figure 3D and Figure S3 , Supporting Information). Cryo-EM images further revealed that the hollow particulate structure remained intact following protein conjugation ( Figure 3E ). It should be noted that the nanoparticles appeared solid in structure upon negative staining under TEM, in which uranyl acetate was precluded from entering the inner core, indicating the structural integrity of the polymeric shell ( Figure 3F ). Through immunogold staining, the presence of RBD antigens on the viromimetic nanoparticles was further confirmed ( Figure 3G ). We also observed that the protein conjugation process had little influence on the encapsulated adjuvant content ( Figure 3H ), which highlighted the particle's stability for surface functionalization.",

Following 24 h of incubation with JAWS II cells, prominent antigen and adjuvant fluorescence signals were observed intracellularly (Figure 4A ). At a high magnification, colocalization of the antigen and adjuvant signals was evident, indicating the viromimetic nanostructure remained stable in the medium condition for cellular uptake. We further examined the distribution of RBD-NP(cdGMP) following subcutaneous administration in mice. One hour after the nanoparticle injection, colocalized antigen and adjuvant signals were observed in the draining lymph node. Further examination of CD169 + cells, which are subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages responsible for capture and recognition of viruses and particulate antigens, [23] showed that a large number of the nanoparticles were colocalized with these \"gatekeeping\" cells ( Figure 4B ). This distribution of the nanoparticle is reminiscent of previous studies showing colocalization of virus virions and CD169 + SCS macrophages in the draining lymph node following footpad injection.

Following a prime-boost vaccination on day 0 and day 21, sera were collected over a span of 300 d for ELISA analysis. Compared to other groups, RBD-NP(cdGMP) induced significantly higher titers of antigen-specific antibodies that reached a peak two weeks postboosting and sustained for 300 d ( Figure 5A) . Notably, IgG subtype analysis on the sera collected on day 35 at the peak of the antibody response showed high levels of RBD-specific IgG2a antibodies in mice immunized with the nanoparticle vaccine, exhibiting a balanced Th1 and Th2 response ( Figure 5B ). In contrast, free MF59 and cdGMP-adjuvanted RBD antigens induced weak IgG1 responses and very limited levels of IgG2a. As Th1-associated responses and durable antibody titers are likely attributed to the help of CD4 + T cell, we next investigated RBD-specific CD4 + T cell responses elicited by different vaccine formulations. T cell responses at the acute phase were first determined seven days after the booster vaccination by restimulating harvested splenocytes with purified RBD antigens. [25] Following intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis, RBD-NP(cdGMP)-inoculated group showed the highest frequency of IFN\u03b3 + subset that corresponds to functional, antigen-specific CD4 + T cells ( Figure 5C ). Moreover, on week 6 postboosting after the transition of effector cells into stable memory populations, [25] CD4 + T cells with the central memory phenotype (CD44 + CD62L + ) were also significantly elevated in the draining lymph nodes of RBD-NP(cdGMP)-immunized mice ( Figure 5E ). The antigen-specific CD4 + T cell as well as the expanded central memory population elicited by the viromimetic nanoparticles can be thus associated with the augmented induction of anti-MERS-CoV RBD antibodies, particularly the Th1-associated IgG2a.",

We further dissected the nanoparticle vaccine-induced CD8 + T cell response using individual synthetic peptides, and we found that the majority of the RBD-specific CD8 + T cell response elicited by the nanoparticle vaccine targeted S395, followed by S483, and S434 ( Figure 6C ).

            "text": "We further evaluated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and safety of this nanoparticle vaccine against MERS-CoV infection in a proof-of-principle study by using highly permissive hDPP4 transgenic mice. Briefly, aliquots of RBD-NP(cdGMP) were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C and transported overseas for assessment in human DPP4-transgenic mice. Upon validating that the nanoparticles retained their expected size, surface antigens, and adjuvant encapsulants following a 2-month storage period ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information), both RBD-NP(cdGMP) and NP(cdGMP), which is without conjugated RBD, were administered subcutaneously to the transgenic mice on day 0 and day 28 ( Figure 7A ). Four weeks after the second immunization, sera were collected for determining the neutralizing antibody titers against live MERS-CoV using a Vero E6 cell-based microneutralization assay. Compared to the undetectable antibody response of the control NP-immunized animals, an average 100% neutralization titer (NT 100 ) of 128, ranging from 40 to 320 could be readily detected in each mouse immunized with RBD-NP(cdGMP) ( Figure 7B and Table S1 , Supporting Information). Following intranasal challenge with 100 LD 50 (\u224810 3 TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain, two mice from each group were euthanized at 2 d postinfection (dpi) for assessing the viral loads and the histopathology of the lungs, whereas the remaining mice were monitored daily for the mortality until 24 dpi. As safety concerns of vaccinationinduced immunopathology have been raised in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection models with whole inactivated virus (WIV), recombinant DNA-based, and even modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccines, [28] we thoroughly examined the pathological changes of lung specimens of challenged mice. Although no any eosinophilic infiltration could be readily observed in either group ( Figure 7C and Figure S5 , Supporting Information), mice immunized with RBD-NP(cdGMP) exhibited a mild infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes as compared to the control nanoparticles ( Figure 7C and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, blue arrows). While the exact nature of eosinophil-free inflammatory responses warrants further investigations, we speculate that the enhanced Th1 responses afforded by the nanoparticle vaccine might be accountable. [29] Given the potent antigen-specific T-cell responses induced by the RBD-NP(cdGMP) and the high viral titer used for the animal challenge, it is likely that the lymphocytic infiltration corresponded to local recruitment of vaccineinduced lymphocytes. The presence of such local lymphocytes has been reported to contribute to protective immunity against the respiratory virus. [30] The viral titers in the animals sacrificed at 2 dpi were subsequently assessed. No infectious progeny virus was recovered from mice immunized with RBD-NP(cdGMP), compared to moderate, but readily detectable yields of infectious virus in control NP-immunized mice ( Figure 7D ). Quantification of the viral loads by quantitative RT-PCR analyses also showed a significant reduction in the amount of MERS-CoV RNA in RBD-NP(cdGMP)-immunized mice ( Figure 7E ), demonstrating effective containment of viral spread and replication. Furthermore, mice immunized with RBD-NP(cdGMP) uniformly survived at 24 dpi upon termination of the study. In contrast, all of the control NP-immunized mice succumbed to infection within 16 dpi (p = 0.0246) ( Figure 7F ). These results of the pilot study validate the efficacy and safety of the NP-based MERS-CoV RBD/cdGMP vaccine against MERS-CoV infection and disease. Additional studies are warranted to comprehensively develop this vaccine candidate against the emerging infectious threat.",

Sporadic outbreaks of the disease continue to be reported with a high mortality rate at \u224835%, and there are no clinically approved vaccines against the pathogen to this date. While candidates include a DNA-based candidate, [31] an adenovirus-based candidate, [12a] and an MVA-based vaccines [32] have entered clinical trials, much ongoing research efforts on MERS-CoV vaccination are focused on recombinant protein subunit vaccines owing to their safety and production consistency. In the present study, MERS-CoV antigens are formulated with synthetic nanoparticles in a virus-like fashion to improve vaccine potency. Among the commonly used MERS-CoV antigens, namely full-length S protein, S1 fragment, and RBD, RBD is herein selected as antibodies against this domain have shown greater virus neutralizing potential compared to the other candidates. [33] Prior studies have adopted S protein-based nanoparticles and RBD-human Fc conjugates to enhance the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV antigens. [34] As MERS-CoV RBD protein by itself is poorly immunogenic 50 , the present nanoparticle vaccine integrates the antigen with cdGMP to promote antibody and T cell responses, thereby obviating the need for human Fc conjugation.",

            "text": "Lessons learnt from SARS-CoV vaccine development as well as prior MERS-CoV vaccine studies indicated that immunologic adjuvants, particularly Th1-biased adjuvants, are critical for improving antigen immunogenicity and reducing eosinophilic immunopathology. However, administration of these adjuvanted formulations needs to be handled with caution as the elevated levels of immunogenicity usually come at the cost of increased systemic inflammatory responses and reactogenicity. The safety concern regarding adjuvant reactogenicity has motivated ongoing development of particulate adjuvant formulations, [35] which have been designed to target the lymphatic system to better promote localized immune responses. For the CDN-based, STING agonist adjuvant adopted in the present study, several vehicles, including liposomes, [9a,36] calcium phosphate nanoparticles, [37] polymeric microparticles, [38] and cationic polymers, [39] have been applied to improve the molecule's potency and safety in prior reports. Compared to the aforementioned STING agonist formulations, the hollow polymeric nanoparticle developed herein possesses the combined advantages of biocompatibility, size consistency, colloidal stability, tunable adjuvant loading, pH-responsive release, and antigen functionalizability. These favorable attributes make the hollow nanoparticles a desirable delivery platform for STING-mediated immune modulation. Examination of the NP(cdGMP) showed many of the reported advantages of nanoparticulate adjuvants, including efficient uptake by antigen presenting cells, enhanced immunostimulating capability, and reduced systemic inflammatory responses. These attributes are expected to improve the immunogenicity, efficacy, safety, and applicability of STING agonists for MERS-CoV and other vaccination purposes. In addition, recombinant viral antigens can be attached to these adjuvant-loaded nanoparticles, enabling mimicry of natural virions for effective immune potentiation and induction of protective immune responses. [40] The co-presence of danger signals during antigen processing by dendritic cells has been identified as an important factor in self/nonself discrimination, [4] and codelivery of antigen and adjuvants by a single carrier has been shown to enhance immune cell activation and antigen presentation. The timing between type I IFN signaling and antigen presentation has also been observed to critically influence immune responses; whereas IFN signaling following antigen presentation (in-sequence signaling) potently stimulates T cell expansion, pre-exposure of T cells to IFNs prior to antigen presentation (out-of-sequence signaling) induces an inhibitory effect. [8] These findings highlight the significance of coordinated antigen and adjuvant delivery and support the viromimetic vaccine design on a mechanistic basis. Further to this point, literature has shown that excessive production of type I IFNs during infection can have detrimental effects on immune responses, [41] and adaptive immunity can be strongly influenced by the timing and magnitude of type I IFN administration [42] and STING activation. [43] While there are lingering concerns with the use of STING agonists as vaccine adjuvants given the pleiotropic role of type I IFNs, it is generally accepted that a short, strong type I IFN response in coordination with antigen presentation is conducive to adaptive immunity. [44] In light of this, the hollow nanoparticle offers an ideal controllable system that can precisely gauge the dosing and timing of type I IFN signaling for robust immune responses. Further study is warranted to systemically evaluate the concentrations of antigen and adjuvant for their influences on immune activation.",

The data indicate that this viromimetic nanoparticulate vaccine was superior in its ability to mount humoral responses when compared to MF59, the state-of-theart adjuvant for influenza vaccine. The antibody generated by the vaccine is capable of neutralizing to MERS-CoV and directly contributes to the protective immunity against viral challenges. Moreover, the nanoparticle vaccine induced a balanced Th1/ Th2 immune response, which is consistent with prior reports of STING-agonist-mediated immune stimulation. [5a,6a,45] The potent Th1 response as indicated by the high levels of IgG2a antibodies likely accounted for the absence of eosinophilic immunopathology. Notably, our nanoparticle vaccines are highly capable of priming both antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses. While there is a yet-to-be-consensus thought that the recovery of MERS-CoV infection may not solely correlate with antibody responses, recent literature is showing increasing emphasis on the role of T cell responses, especially CD8 + T cells, in protective immunity against MERS-CoV. [15] Future studies further dissecting humoral and cellular immune responses in MERS-CoV protection are warranted.",

[46] While most of these vaccine candidates are immunogenic and effective in immunized animals against subsequent live virus challenges, concerns over their safety with regard to the induction of immunization-induced immunopathology and/or antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in immunized and challenged animals exist. These undesirable host responses are characterized by enhanced pulmonary eosinophilic and monocytic infiltration, accompanied by an increased recruitment of complement protein C3a without any sign of uncontrollable viral infection. [46] It was noted that passive transfer of sera that contain MERS-CoV-specific but nonneutralizing antibodies derived from infected or a full-length S protein-immunized rabbits to na\u00efve rabbits resulted in exacerbated pulmonary inflammation, further accentuating the safety concern over suboptimal host responses to infection and/or immunization. [47] It has also been observed that live MERS-CoV challenge of highly permissive human DPP4 transgenic mice immunized with either alum-or MF59-formulated WIV uniformly caused significant increases in Th2-skewed eosinophilic infiltration within the lungs. [14] Recently, we noted human DPP4 transgenic mice immunized with recombinant adenovirus Ad5encoding S1 (rASd5-S1) exhibited varying extents of perivascular hemorrhage within the lungs upon challenge despite its impressive immunogenicity and efficacy against the lethality of MERS-CoV. [48] In this study, the prototype nanoparticle-based MERS vaccine is not only immunogenic and effective in inhibiting viral infection, but also obviates the induction of undesirable lung pathology in immunized and challenged human DPP4 transgenic mice. These encouraging results warrant further development of the nanoparticle-based vaccine platform.",

While live microbes have long provided design inspirations for vaccine engineering, [49] the present work further advances the pathogen-mimicking concept with the STING agonist-loaded, capsid-like hollow nanoparticles. Unlike most prior reports of PLGA-based nanoformulations that have inadequate encapsulation capacity for water-soluble compounds, the hollow PLGA nanoparticles presently herein permit tunable encapsulation and controlled release of water-soluble STING agonists. The cargo of the nanoparticles may be further adjusted to modulate immune stimulation, and the particles' functionalizability allows for attachment of different recombinant viral antigens to tailor to specific vaccination needs. Consisting entirely of biocompatible materials, the nanoparticles are safe to administer, and they can be stored and transported upon freezing. Although the need for cold chain transportation would incur additional cost, we anticipate the public health benefit to outweigh the technological and logistical investment. Toward future translation, scalable manufacturing is expected to benefit from existing infrastructures for recombinant protein production and polymeric nanoformulations. [50] By effectively coupling viral antigens with immunologic adjuvants, nanoparticle vaccines with minimal safety concerns and potency rivaling viral vector-based formulations can be envisioned.",

After incubation, cells were further washed three times and resuspended in 0.2 mL of PBS before flow cytometric analysis using FACS LSR II (BD Biosciences). Analysis was done by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). For in vivo immune potentiation analysis, free cdGMP or nanoparticle-encapsulated cdGMP were inoculated to C57BL/6 mice via footpad injection. At various time points, mice sera were collected, and popliteal lymph nodes were homogenized in DMEM. Cytokines were measured by TNF-\u03b1 mouse uncoated ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher scientific) and mouse IFN-\u03b2 ELISA kit (R&D systems) from the serum and homogenate.",

For the proof-of-principle study, two groups of five age-and sex-matched human DPP4-transgenic mice were immunized subcutaneously twice, four weeks apart, with either the MERS-CoV RBD nanoparticle vaccine or control nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were thawed in a 37 \u00b0C water bath from samples that were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for 2 months.

Virally challenged mice were monitored daily for clinical manifestations (i.e., weight loss) and mortality for at least 24 d after infection. Two of the five mice were sacrificed on day 2 postchallenge to assess the lung viral loads by Vero E6-based infection assay and quantitative PCR as previously described.
