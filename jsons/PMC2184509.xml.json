            "text": "Viruses have evolved a panoply of different mechanisms to subvert cellular processes to their own advantage. In particular, viruses must overcome the potent antiviral and inflammatory effects of innate immune cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN\u03b1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). The induction and activity of these antiviral cytokines is controlled by, among other factors, Ub and Ub-like (UBL) molecules (Kirkin and Dikic, 2007). The activation of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) by TNF\u03b1 was one of the first immune regulatory pathways found to be dependent on protein ubiquitination (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000). NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells through binding to I\u03baB. TNF\u03b1 binding to its receptor induces I\u03baB phosphorylation followed by K48-linked poly-ubiquitination targeting I\u03baB for proteasomal degradation. This releases NF-\u03baB dimers for translocation to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription. NF-\u03baB-induced genes include type I IFN and other cytokines, hence this Ub-controlled pathway plays a vital role in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as in inflammation (Tergaonkar, 2006). In addition to ubiquitination of I\u03baB, K63- and K48-linked ubiquitination regulates other molecules involved in this signaling pathway (Chen, 2005).",

            "text": "Ub and ISG15 are synthesized as inactive precursors with C-terminal extensions that undergo cleavage to reveal the motif required for conjugation. Coordinated activities of an enzymatic cascade comprising an activating enzyme (E1), a conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ligase (E3) result in the conjugation of Ub or ISG15 to the \u025b-amino group of a lysine residue present in the target protein. Both Ub and ISG15 conjugation can be reversed by the activity of deconjugating enzymes. Deubiquitinating (DUB) proteolytic enzymes are also involved in processing of Ub precursors. Five classes of DUBs have been described (Nijman et al., 2005); one of the most recently identified is the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family. This family comprises a group of putative cysteine proteases, homologous to the OTU protein in Drosophila, and includes more than a hundred proteins from eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses (Makarova et al., 2000). Several OTU domain-containing mammalian proteins, such as Cezanne (Evans et al., 2003), Otubain 1 and 2 (Balakirev et al., 2003), and A20 (Evans et al., 2004) have been identified as proteases that participate in substrate-specific deubiquitinating processes. For example, A20 is an important downregulator of TNF\u03b1 signaling via its deubiquitination of TRAF6 (Boone et al., 2004) and its dual function of poly-Ub63 deconjugation followed by poly-Ub48 modification of RIP (Wertz et al., 2004). These activities are mediated by its N-terminal OTU domain and its C-terminal zinc finger domain, respectively. However, the substrate specificity and physiologic role of most OTU domain-containing proteins remains unknown.",

            "text": "As protein ubiquitination and ISGylation are both important for innate immunity, rely on terminal LRLRGG sequences, and share a common mechanism of conjugation, we tested the hypothesis that viral OTU domain-containing proteases regulate Ub- and ISG15-dependent innate immunity via deconjugating protease activity. We found that two unrelated families of RNA viruses express OTU domain-containing proteases with the capacity to decrease Ub and ISG15 conjugation. Nairoviruses are negative-sense, segmented, RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family. Their large (L) protein contains an OTU domain and an RNA polymerase domain, placing this protein in the growing category of multifunctional viral proteins. Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a human nairovirus that causes hemorrhagic fever with up to 30% mortality (Whitehouse, 2004). Arteriviruses, including equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), are the causative agents of important diseases in horses and pigs. They are positive-sense, nonsegmented RNA viruses that contain an OTU domain within their nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2), which is also involved in viral replicase polyprotein processing (Snijder et al., 1995). We found that these viral OTU domains, in contrast to known mammalian OTU proteases, display a broad deconjugating activity toward ubiquitinated and ISGylated products and consequently inhibit innate immunity pathways that are dependent on Ub and ISG15. Thus, the deconjugating activity of viral OTU domains represents a unique strategy used by nairoviruses and arteriviruses to evade the host antiviral response, probably by targeting a common biochemical structure in Ub and the UBL protein ISG15.",

This domain was also present in the L proteins of the nairoviruses Dugbe virus (DUGV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus (Honig et al., 2004) but has not been found in the L proteins of any other genus in the Bunyaviridae family. An alignment of the OTU domains present in nairoviruses, arteriviruses, and mammalian proteins A20, Cezanne, VCIP135, Otubain 1, and Otubain 2 revealed limited identity; however, a strong conservation of D37, G38, N39, C40, W71, H151, and an aromatic amino acid at position 152 (numbering based on the CCHFV-L sequence) was observed (Figure 1, black boxes). Among these amino acids, C40 and H151 (Figure 1, black arrows) were predicted to be the catalytic residues present in the putative protease active site (Balakirev et al., 2003, Makarova et al., 2000, Nanao et al., 2004, Snijder et al., 1995).",

Transfection of cells with plasmids expressing CCHFV-L slightly decreased the overall expression of Ub-conjugated proteins (Figure 2B, lanes 1 and 2, panel A; Figure 2C, lanes 1, 4, and 5, panel A). To test the effect of CCHFV-L expression on protein ISGylation, ISG15 conjugates were generated by transfecting plasmids expressing ISG15 and its specific E1 (UBE1L) (Yuan and Krug, 2001) and E2 (UbcM8) (Kim et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2004) enzymes, since endogenous levels of ISGylated proteins are low in the absence of IFN stimulation. Cotransfection of CCHFV-L resulted in a clear decrease in the level of ISGylated proteins (Figure 2B, lanes 1 and 2, panel B; Figure 2C, lanes 1, 4, and 5, panel B). This decrease was also observed when CCHFV-L was untagged (data not shown). The decrease in total ISGylation was comparable to the effect of UBP43, a known ISG15 deconjugating enzyme (Figure 2B, lane 9, panel B). Expression of CCHFV-L did not affect levels of expression of UBE1L or UbcM8 (Figure 2B, lane 2, panels C and D; Figure 2C, lanes 4 and 5, panel C), consistent with CCHFV-L acting via inhibition of ubiquitination and ISGylation reactions or by directly deubiquitinating or deISGylating proteins.",

Recombinant L(1\u2013169) cleaved both K48- and K63-linked poly-Ub chains into monomers (Figure 3B, lanes 2 to 5), similarly to isopeptidase T, a known DUB enzyme (Figure 3B, lane 10). This activity was markedly decreased by mutating the amino acid C40 (Figure 3B, lanes 6 to 9), indicating that this residue is required for optimal protease activity. The small amount of deconjugation observed with L(1\u2013169)1A is not unexpected, as mutation of Cezanne's catalytic cysteine yielded similar data where most, but not all, catalytic activity was impaired (Evans et al., 2003).

For this, we generated cell lysates from IFN\u03b2-treated Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are rich in ISG15 conjugates (Malakhov et al., 2003). Incubation of these lysates with recombinant L(1\u2013169) protein, but not L(1\u2013169)1A, appreciably decreased ISGylated proteins (Figure 3C, top panel) in a L(1\u2013169) concentration-dependent manner. This result suggests that the CCHFV OTU domain has C40-dependent ISG15 deconjugating activity but does not exclude the possibility that the protease activity of the viral OTU domain was activating another deISGylating enzyme present in cell lysates. To address this possibility, we enriched 6xHisISG15 conjugates using affinity chromatography. Incubation of ISG15 conjugates with increasing amounts of L(1\u2013169) resulted in ISG15 deconjugation (Figure 3C, lanes 2 to 5, bottom panel). No deconjugation was detected with the mutant L(1\u2013169)1A protein (Figure 3C, lanes 6 to 9, bottom panel). In addition, L(1\u2013169) processed a pro-ISG15 protein into its mature form (Figure 3E, lane 2, panel A). These data suggest that the CCHFV-L OTU domain directly deconjugates ISGylated proteins through its predicted cysteine protease activity.",

While the catalytic domain of SENP2 (SENP2CD), a SUMO-specific protease, could hydrolyze SUMO chains to monomers (Figure 3D, lane 10) and process pro-SUMO-1 (Figure 3E, lane 5, panel C), neither L(1\u2013169) nor L(1\u2013169)1A was able to cleave SUMO chains or a pro-SUMO-1 precursor. However, similar to its ability to process pro-ISG15 (Figure 3E, lane 2, panel A), L(1\u2013169) hydrolyzed pro-Nedd8 into a mature form (Figure 3E, lane 2, panel B). In summary, the OTU domain of CCHFV-L hydrolyzes Ub and ISG15, but not SUMO-2 or SUMO-3, from conjugates in vitro, suggesting that viral OTU domains have the unique ability to recognize Ub and specific UBL molecules.",

The arterivirus nsp2 cysteine protease cleaves the nsp2/nsp3 site within the large viral polyprotein during replicase maturation. In the case of EAV, this process is known to be mediated by the 166 N-terminal residues of nsp2, which contains the OTU domain (Snijder et al., 1995). In our study, a slightly larger N-terminal EAV-nsp2 domain (175 amino acids; nsp2N) was used in addition to the full-length protein. The OTU domain of the L protein of DUGV, a nairovirus related to CCHFV, as well as EAV-nsp2, EAV-nsp2N, and PRRSV-nsp2, decreased Ub and ISG15 conjugates when expressed in 293T cells (\nFigure 4A, lanes 3\u20136), indicating that deconjugation may be an immune evasion strategy shared by diverse viral families.",

In contrast, only overexpression of Otubain 1 and Cezanne moderately decreased cellular global Ub conjugate levels, while expression of A20 or Otubain 2 had no effect on total levels of ubiquitinated proteins (Balakirev et al., 2003, Evans et al., 2003, Evans et al., 2004). To date, there have been no published studies investigating the effects of these proteins on ISG15 conjugates. We therefore tested Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne, VCIP135, and A20 for their ability to decrease overall protein ubiquitination and ISGylation in transfected cells (Figure 4B). Expression of Otubain 1 resulted in a significant decrease in Ub conjugate levels, while Otubain 2 and Cezanne had a lesser effect (Figure 4B, lanes 2\u20134, panel 1). Consistent with their specificity for particular ubiquitinated substrates, expression of VCIP135 and A20 did not result in a decrease in overall ubiquitination. None of the OTU-containing mammalian proteins tested decreased global levels of ISG15 conjugates (Figure 4B, lanes 2\u20136, panel 2). Similar results were obtained when truncation mutants expressing the OTU domains of Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne, and A20 were tested (data not shown). In addition, the OTU-containing catalytic domain of A20 (A20CD) was unable to process either ISG15 or Nedd8 (Figure 3E, lane 4, panels A and B), even though it cleaved K48-linked Ub chains (Figure 3F, lane 4). By contrast, overexpression of the mammalian deISGylating enzyme UBP43 decreased overall levels of ISG15 conjugates but not Ub conjugates (Figure 4B, lane 7). Thus, viral OTU proteases appear to be unique in their ability to target both ISG15 and Ub conjugates.",

We obtained germline transgene transmission in three lines designated 1836, 1854, and 2929, and we evaluated L(1\u20131325) expression in both MEFs and brain lysates from these transgenic lines. MEF cells and brain tissue from 1836 transgenic mice contained detectable L(1\u20131325) protein, while protein expression from the 1854 and 2929 lines was either undetectable or very low (\nFigures 5A and 5B). We next evaluated the sensitivity of L(1\u20131325) transgenic mice to infection with the virulent Sindbis virus strain AR86, an alphavirus that causes lethal encephalitis in young mice and is sensitive to ISG15-mediated antiviral effects (Lenschow et al., 2005). Susceptibility to Sindbis virus infection tracked with expression of the L(1\u20131325) protein (Figure 5C). Thirty-five percent of mice from the 1836 transgenic line survived infection compared to \u226580% survival in C57/BL6 littermate controls or transgenic mice expressing low or undetectable levels of transgene-encoded protein. The decreased survival of line 1836 transgenic mice following AR86 infection suggests that CCHFV-L OTU enhances susceptibility to viral disease in vivo.",

Following transfection with ISG15 and its E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, ISGylated proteins can be detected in BHK-21 cells (Figure 6B, lane 1, middle panel). Infection with 169GG or 169 greatly reduced ISG15 conjugates, confirming that OTU expression results in deconjugation of ISGylated proteins.

In order to exclude effects due to IFN\u03b1\u03b2-stimulated genes other than ISG15, we infected IFN\u03b1\u03b2R\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 6C). Seventy percent of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and the mutant OTU domain (MTGG) survived, consistent with previous observations that expression of ISG15 protects mice from lethality following Sindbis virus infection (Lenschow et al., 2005). In contrast, only 20% of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and a functional OTU domain (169GG) survived infection (p = 0.0015). These data also correlate with our in vitro data demonstrating that L(1\u2013169), but not L(1\u2013169)2A, can deISGylate proteins following infection (Figure 6B). Mice infected with 169 or MT died with similar kinetics, demonstrating that the expression of L(1\u2013169) did not increase the virulence of dsTE12Q in the absence of the IFN-mediated antiviral response. The slight increase in survival between 169GG and 169 (p < 0.0001) or MT (p = 0.0032) suggests that expression of the CCHFV OTU domain cannot completely antagonize the effects of ISG15 in this system. Nevertheless, these data show that expression of a catalytically active viral OTU domain can antagonize the antiviral effects of ISG15 in vivo.",

To address this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of the CCHFV-L and EAV-nsp2 OTU domains on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Expression of the OTU domains of CCHFV-L and of EAV-nsp2 decreased in a dose-dependent manner the activation of an NF-\u03baB-responsive promoter (Fujita et al., 1992) after TNF\u03b1 treatment. This inhibition was similar to that mediated by A20, an OTU domain-containing inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway (\nFigure 7A). Inhibition was about 10-fold greater in the presence of the L(1\u2013169) domain than the L(1\u2013169)2A mutant, indicating a role for the OTU domain protease activity. These results were further confirmed by the ability of CCHFV-L(1\u2013169) to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation as measured by the inhibition of endogenous p65 nuclear translocation upon TNF\u03b1 treatment (Figures 7B and 7C). The slight inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation by the L(1\u2013169)2A protein could be caused by some residual binding of this mutant to ubiquitinated substrates or by the presence of some other regulatory motifs within this protein. Nevertheless, the p65 nuclear translocation inhibition by the L(1\u2013169) protein was significantly higher when compared to its mutant counterpart (p = 0.0044). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of viral OTU domains to affect immune pathways that are regulated by ubiquitination.",

Inhibition of protein ubiquitination might also affect other cellular processes that can be subverted by viruses for their own advantage, such as the proteasome-mediated protein degradation system, multiple signal transduction events, or cell cycle progression. Given the effects that we observed on NF-\u03baB signaling, it seems likely that viral OTU domain-containing proteases may be able to target these and other Ub-dependent pathways.",

Thus, it is not surprising that viruses may use multiple strategies to counter the antiviral effects of ISG15. The work presented here provides a viral strategy for decreasing expression of bona fide ISG15 conjugates in cells. The first such strategy reported is the direct association of the NS1 protein of influenza B virus with ISG15. This association inhibits protein ISGylation by blocking the ISG15-UBE1L interaction (Yuan et al., 2002, Yuan and Krug, 2001), while the viral OTU domain proteases analyzed here accomplish a similar effect via deconjugation.",

This raises the interesting possibility that sequences similar to the LRLRGG motif may play an important role in substrate recognition and specific cleavage by CCHFV-L OTU and perhaps other viral proteases. Interestingly, the nsp2 of arteriviruses cleaves the nsp2/3 junction at FRLIGG (EAV) or GRLLGG (PRSSV) (Allende et al., 1999, Snijder et al., 1996, Ziebuhr et al., 2000), sequences similar to the LRLRGG motif. Thus, arterivirus OTU proteases have dual functions: performing essential viral polyprotein processing and targeting host substrates to modulate the antiviral response. This is analogous to the hepatitis C virus NS3-4A protease, which is involved both in viral polyprotein processing and in cleaving the cellular antiviral proteins TRIF and IPS-1 (Li et al., 2005, Lin et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Our demonstration that viral OTU domain-containing proteases can decrease both Ub and ISG15 conjugates in cells does not alone constitute proof that protease activity directed toward these substrates plays a role in viral infection. We were limited in performing the obvious experiment of assessing the role of viral OTU domain protease activity during infection by two things. First, CCHFV is a biosafety level 4 pathogen lacking a good animal model and whose molecular biology is not well enough developed to allow generation of mutant viruses. Second, the viral OTU domain proteases evaluated here either have, or are likely to have, important effects on processing of viral polyproteins (see above). Given this, we felt that it would be difficult to prove that these proteases have effects during infection that are solely attributable to their DUB and deISGylating activities. However, in transgenic mice, recombinant chimeric Sindbis viruses, and transfected cells, we found that viral OTU domain-containing proteases have significant effects on Ub- and ISG15-dependent host processes of known importance for innate immunity. We therefore conclude that these proteins have bona fide immune evasion properties. It will be interesting to further investigate the activities of these and other viral proteases that target Ub- and ISG15-dependent processes during viral infection.",
