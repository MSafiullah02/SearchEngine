Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major pathogen identified. The roles played by other viral agents are controversial and depend partly on the population being studied and the laboratory methods used for detection. Correlation with disease is particularly problematic because viruses that commonly infect this young age group can cause high rates of asymptomatic infection or prolonged shedding, including adenoviruses and human bocavirus (hBoV). In addition, some agents, such as rhinoviruses, may trigger asthmatic airway inflammation and bronchospasm without causing the small airway pathology characteristic of infection of the lower respiratory tract with bronchiolitis.",

Native American and Native Alaskan children have hospitalization rates two to three times higher than those of the general population of U.S. children of the same age.35 Nevertheless, the major independent risk factor for bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization is young age, within the first 6 months of life.11, 33\n",

Because resistance to airflow is related inversely to the cube of the radius of the airway, the inflammation and edema make the lumina of small airways in infants particularly vulnerable to obstruction (see Fig. 68-1). Plugs of necrotic material and fibrin may completely or partially obstruct the small airways. Smooth muscle constriction does not seem to be a major factor in the obstruction. In areas peripheral to sites of partial obstruction, air becomes trapped by a process similar to a \u201cball-valve\u201d mechanism. Negative intrapleural pressure exerted during inspiration allows air to flow beyond the point of partial obstruction. On expiration, however, the size of the lumen decreases, resulting in obstruction and gas trapping. In areas peripheral to obstruction, trapped air is eventually absorbed, which results in multiple areas of atelectasis. This absorptive atelectasis is accelerated when a child breathes high concentrations of oxygen, which is absorbed into the blood much faster than nitrogen. The degree of atelectasis or hyperinflation that develops is greater in infants than it would be in older children or adults because collateral channels that maintain alveolar expansion in the presence of airway obstruction are not well developed early in life.",
