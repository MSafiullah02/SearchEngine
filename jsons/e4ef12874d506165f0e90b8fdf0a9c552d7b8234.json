The outcome was poor for these elderly, with 52 (72%) eventually dying. Compared with the overall mortality in all age groups (17%), the mortality was much higher in the nursing home residents.

The nursing home was divided into seven cubicles of 12 m 2 each by wooden partitions of 1.2 m high. Each cubicle was crowded with four beds with a living space of less than 3 m 2 /resident. Toilet commodes were placed next to the bed in each cubicle, for frailer residents. No single room was available for isolation purposes. The staff to resident ratio was approximately 1 : 14, and the majority of resident staff had no formal training in health care and infection control. Table 1 illustrates a cluster of epidemiological-linked cases of SARS that happened in the nursing home during the crisis in Hong Kong in April 2003. Case 1, who was likely to be the index patient, was discharged back to the nursing home while infected with SARS during a hospital stay, and spread the disease to the other residents and working staff in the nursing home, and subsequently to the community via visitors.

Following discharge back to the nursing homes, most of the residents continued to cohort in the side rooms. However, most of the nursing homes had no isolation rooms or any related facilities. For the nursing home described, patients were isolated in one of the cubicles sited at the corner with the use of an electric fan and opened windows to facilitate 'better ventilation'.

Moreover, sharing of medical equipment like sphygmomanometers and oximeters among patients may be a source of viral spread. Elderly, who are cognitive impaired and lack safety awareness, are often reluctant to wear surgical face masks which endanger him/herself and others' lives. Some of them may behave poorly, for example, spitting, touching with hands after contact with their own nasal and oral secretions, urination at the bedside etc. Thus, this would pose a higher chance of disease spreading quickly in nursing homes.

Rehabilitation services offered by physiotherapists and occupational therapists, was nearly abandoned. In contrast, relatives were not allowed to visit nursing home residents during the SARS crisis. They were not encouraged to attend regular government out-patient clinic visits. Community nursing visits were limited and social activities were markedly reduced in the nursing home also. Moreover, SARS may pose a psychological stress to the elderly. Through fear of cross-infection, they would be afraid to attend social activities. They would feel anxious and worried of hospital admissions and also clinic attendance. As relatives were not allowed to visit them during hospitalization, they would feel lonely, as though being abandoned. In some cases it may exacerbate major depression.",

For elderly homes, close collaboration and communication with the community geriatric assessment team, hospitals and the primary health care system, are essential to the surveillance of the disease in the older population. The community geriatric assessment team, composed of geriatricians, on-site visiting medical officers, and nurses, will act as an excellent role to provide support to nursing homes. 6, 7 The team will improve surveillance by performing close monitoring of nursing home residents discharged from hospital. They also work closely with the Department of Health to provide up-to-date information to nursing homes afflicted with SARS on infection control and proper techniques in routine care and high risk procedures, for example suction, feeding, bathing and handling of excrements. They provide consultation and management on sub-acute medical problems, in particular, febrile patients in institutions in order to prevent unnecessary and inappropri-ate hospitalizations. Fever of any cause should be closely observed and investigated. Although, people can start to think that the public health system will not be able to cope with outbreaks as it is unlikely to be possible to isolate everybody who has febrile illness and upper respiratory tract symptoms that mimic SARS. The challenge will be to maintain a sufficient level of surveillance while ensuring that the common cold does not override common sense. A rapid diagnostic test with high sensitivity remains the important key to lessening the burden of fear and economic impact. As symptoms of influenza might mimic SARS in the early stage, influenza vaccine should be offered to all nursing homes residents, including the working staff, during epidemic seasons in order to decrease the need for hospitalization and to eliminate misdiagnosis and over-diagnosis of SARS. 8, 9 Moreover, during a SARS crisis, it is equally important to closely monitor the health condition of the working staff and advise them to refrain from duty if fever and other symptoms suspected of SARS appear. Nursing homes should also keep an information record of visiting relatives for contact tracing and surveillance.",

The spread of infectious disease within hospitals and nursing homes is a public health concern. Therefore, the most effective way of preventing the disease spread is to avoid hospitalization.
