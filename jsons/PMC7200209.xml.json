Two months prior, on January 23, 2020, there were only 581 reported cases. COVID-19 can rapidly spread from human-to-human and is more contagious than other notable members of the coronavirus family, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) [1, 2]. The World Health Organization recently declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and the USA has declared a national emergency. Even though the incidence of COVID-19 infection in children is less than it is in adults, the total number of pediatric cases is expected to increase rapidly in the coming weeks.",

Although mortality in children has been reported [8], studies have demonstrated that COVID-19 is generally less severe compared to adults in terms of both symptoms and computerized tomography (CT) manifestations [9\u201318]. The common chest CT patterns are ground-glass opacities (GGO) followed by local bilateral shadowing (LPS), in contrast to a large percentage of bilateral patchy shadowing (BPS) pattern in adults [19, 20]. However, there are no studies that quantitatively examine the location of lung lesions in COVID-19-positive pediatric patients [21]. Most of the pediatric patients are at the early stages of the disease when admitted to hospitals. Thus, a detailed localization study is meaningful both clinically and scientifically, as it could help pinpoint lung regions that are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection.",

The discrepancy in laboratory interpretations could be attributed to the studies each referring to a different set of reference values. Of note, the range of normal lab values changes depending upon the age of the child, i.e., a 1-year-old has a different set of reference values than a 9-year-old. Confounding these results is the fact that the reference values used among the studies lack consistency and appear to be hospital-self-defined values [15, 22\u201324]. This inconsistency of reference values makes any systemic review of the published data less meaningful [23].",

However, there is no publication to study its usefulness in evaluating clinical recovery for children with COVID-19 infection. To determine whether CT is necessary, we investigated the data of 23 patients who had been discharged after effective treatment and had at least two CT scans. All patients had normal body temperatures for more than 3 days at the time of discharge, clinical symptoms disappeared, and PCR tests all returned negative twice at 24-h intervals. Of the 23 children, eight patients did not receive CT scans within the 2 days before their discharge. However, in their most recent CT scan performed in the hospital, most children either still had lesions (50%), or more developed lesions since the previous scan (37%). The remaining 15 discharged children had a CT obtained within 2 days of discharge. Again, ten patients had lesions that were not completely absorbed (67%), two were the same (13%), and lesions in another two became worse (13%). These results indicate that CT may not be better than symptoms in evaluating recovery. Our Cox regression analysis further showed that there was no association between changes in CT lesions and clinical outcomes. The results are consistent with the knowledge that clinical improvement predates radiographic improvement by weeks for children with community-acquired pneumonia.",

Hong et al., in a study of 12,068,821 children aged 0 to 19 years, found a statistically significant increase in cancer in children exposed at least once to diagnostic low-dose ionizing radiation after adjusting for age and sex [29, 30]. Based on our data, we do not recommend using CT for determining clinical recovery unless it is necessary to evaluate the status of pneumonia. For comparison, the current criteria for discharging adult patients infected with COVID-19 in China are (1) normal body temperature for 3 days, (2) two negative PCR tests at 24-h intervals, (3) resolution of clinical symptoms (these three are the current criteria for discharging pediatric patients in this hospital), plus (4) a chest imaging requirement: pulmonary imaging must show significant absorption of lesions. To date, there are no child-specific discharge criteria for COVID-19 in China.",
