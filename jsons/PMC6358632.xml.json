In contrast to classical chemotherapy, CPIs do not target tumor cells; rather they enhance activation of immune cells, particularly T cells (Fig. 1) [1]. They have been associated with better outcomes in a number of solid and hematological malignancies [2]. Moreover, compared with chemotherapy, their tolerance seems to be higher with fewer side effects.",

Ipilimumab was associated with a higher risk of grade III\u2013IV colitis than PD-1/PDL-1i [7]. In a recent meta-analysis, PD-1 and PDL-1i seem to be associated with grade III\u2013IV IrAE with similar frequencies [10]. However, the incidence of these IrAE was far lower than the rate of complications from chemotherapy, particularly infections. Grade III\u2013V toxicities were more common with CTLA-4i than with PD-1i (31% vs. 10%) [11]. IrAE leading to death were exceedingly rare for PD-1i (PDL-1i 0.1%, PD-1i 0.3%) and most often secondary to pneumonitis, whereas fatal gastrointestinal (GI) IrAE (diarrhea, colitis, colonic perforation) mostly occurred with CTLA-4i (severe events 31%) [11]. Furthermore, the safety profile of CPI varies among tumor types: melanoma has a higher risk of GI and skin IrAE and lower frequencies of pneumonitis [12, 13]. Moreover, combining two CPIs leads to more frequent severe complications in up to 55% of patients [14\u201316]. Also, the incidence of rAE and severe IrAE will probably increase in the future, with the increasing number of patients currently treated and the use of combination regimens already tested in several trials [17\u201319].",

The most frequent CT findings were ground-glass opacities in all patients, reticular opacities (19/20 patients) and airspace consolidation (12/20 patients), with a common organizing pneumonia pattern in 13 (65%) patients (Fig. 5). Abnormal findings occurred in the lower lobes with a peripheral distribution [33, 39, 41]. Another CT pattern encountered was non-specific interstitial pneumonia. Unfortunately, none of the studies described the findings of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Other causes of acute respiratory failure (infection including, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, relapsing cancer etc.) must be excluded. BAL should be performed in those cases. In one study, lung biopsy was performed in 11 patients. The histological findings were cellular interstitial pneumonitis, common organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage.

Furthermore, they are usually prescribed for a long duration which could lead to delayed toxicity. Some cases reports describe permanent disability after neurological toxicity. Central neurotoxicity can take several forms, from headache after ipilimumab induction to chronic encephalopathy or aseptic meningitis [53, 54]. Stroke and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after ipilimumab may occur and could lead to ICU admission [52]. Seizures remain rare [54\u201356], peripheral neurotoxicity occurs with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome or neuromyopathy, after CTLA-4i or anti-PDL-1i treatment [52, 53]. Myasthenic syndromes may occur mostly with PD1i treatment [57, 58], early after treatment initiation [59] (Table 2).
