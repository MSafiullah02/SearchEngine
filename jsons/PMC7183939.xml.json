Between March 1st and March 17th 2020, we reported the data about 114 patients infected with COVID-19. For each patient, the diagnosis was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR on respiratory samples [1]. Out of the 114 patients, 55 (48%) had diarrhea. In our study, the main symptoms (> 50% of cases) were fatigue (107 [94%]), cough (92 [81%]), fever (> 38 \u00b0C) for 90 patients [79%] and pain syndrome (78 [68%]). Diarrhea was the fifth most common symptom followed by anosmia. In the group of patients with diarrhea, the median age was 56 years (\u00b1 18) and 32 (58%) were female. Only 2 patients (3.6%) had a past history of inflammatory bowel disease. Fifty-six percent of patients (n\n = 30/54) were hospitalised. Diarrhea appeared 4.5 days (\u00b1 1.8) after the onset of the first other symptoms in COVID-19. Of the 55 patients with diarrhea, 29 (52.7%) had at least one simultaneous gastrointestinal (GI) symptom other than diarrhea. Twenty-five patients (45.5%) had nausea, 19 patients (34.5%) had abdominal pain and 9 (16.3%) had vomiting. The symptoms, which were statistically more frequent in the group with diarrhea than in the group without diarrhea, were: myalgia (44 vs. 36, P\n = 0.05), sore throat (21 vs. 11, P\n = 0.027), sneezing (22 vs. 10, P\n = 0.006) and the other GI symptoms: nausea (25 vs. 12, P\n = 0.008), abdominal pain (19 vs. 7, P\n = 0.004) and vomiting (9 vs. 2, P\n = 0.028). It is important to note that patients with diarrhea were less admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (4 vs. 8, P\n = 0.027).",

            "text": "In other parts, we found different results than Li et al. have about the occurrence of diarrhea. Diarrhea was present in half of our patients; compared to the review of Li et al., diarrhea was clearly more often noticed in our study. A study with a prospective methodology confirmed our data. Lechien et al. described an occurrence of diarrhea in 51% of cases in 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients [6]. We can argue that their population was only ambulatory cases with mild or moderate COVID-19 and possibly the occurrence of diarrhea in hospitalised patients is different. However, more than half of our patients were hospitalised, and we have the same result. Our main point is that diarrhea is probably more prevalent than 5.8% in cases of COVID-19. We have few assumptions to explain the differences between Asia studies in comparison to these results. Firstly, the theoretical possibility of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome can be associated with a clinical impact, but not described until now. On the other hand, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for the ACE2 can be specific to an ethnic group and explain a variability of clinical expression between different ethnic groups. Finally, most of the studies in the review of Li et al. had a retrospective methodology. Our study was also retrospective, and data was collected from the medical files of patients; however, we have a strong and accurate description of functional symptoms due to our national guidelines, which recommended a home follow-up for patients who were not hospitalised [7]. Practically, patients, who were not hospitalised or patients who were discharged, were called 7 days (\u00b1 7 days) after the first symptoms and every week until their recoveries to follow their clinical evolution.",
