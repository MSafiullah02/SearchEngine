Gender, age, and working positions had the most relation with anxiety, respectively. It seems that HCWs experienced a high level of anxiety in the COVID-19 outbreak.

The scores of BAI for the participants had positive skew distribution, which means the majority of health care workers had minimal to mild anxiety (N = 627, 60.4%). The other 411 workers had moderate to severe anxiety (39.6%). Our population's overall BAI score ranged from 0 to 63 and had a mean value of 15.30\u00b111.43 with a median of 12. The score of anxiety was higher among employees less than 40 years old. The age groups under 40 years had a similar mean anxiety score (age 20-25: mean anxiety score of 16.46; age 26-30: mean anxiety score of 16.33; age 31-40; mean anxiety score of 16.16). However, anxiety score was lower in \u226541 years old workers, and the mean score was similar among age groups above 40 years (age 41-50: mean anxiety score of 12.73; age \u226551: mean anxiety score of 12.82). Male workers had lower anxiety than females (mean anxiety score: 10.26 vs. 16.03). Male employees between 31-40 years old had the lowest anxiety (mean score of 9.05). However, the highest anxiety was seen in female employees between 31-40 years of age (mean score of 17.19). Analysis of different working positions shows the lowest anxiety score in physicians (mean score of 13.03) followed by midwives, nurses, and others (mean score of 15.80 vs. 15.88 vs. 16.01, respectively). The highest anxiety was seen in female workers of other working positions group (mean score of 16.82). Table 2 presents the BAI score (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) in male and female workers according to their age and working positions.

The level of anxiety was significantly different in male and female workers (F (1, 1035) = 29.45, P= 0.0001), and according to table 2, the level of anxiety was higher in female workers. There was a statistically significant difference in the level of anxiety in different age groups (F (4, 999) = 4.71, P= 0.001). Pearson correlation coefficient test showed a negative relation between the age and the level of anxiety (R = 0.13, P = 0.0001). Higher ages were associated with lower anxiety in our population. There was not a relation between first-line/second-line workers and anxiety (F (1, 1035) = 0.05, P=0.82). However, different working positions (physicians, nurses, midwives, others) had a different level of anxiety, which was statistically significant (F (3, 1033) = 3.59, P = 0.01). According to partial eta squared, it can be concluded that sex, age, and four groups of working positions had the most relation with anxiety, respectively. The results of the analysis of variance were followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to examine the difference between different ages and working positions. As shown in table 4, the age group of 41-50 years had lower anxiety than 26-30 and 31-40 year groups. Other age groups were similar in terms of the level of anxiety. Furthermore, the analysis showed that nurses had higher anxiety than physicians. However, there was not a statistically significant difference between other working positions groups (according to table 4).
