Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of COVID-19 (Interim Version 5) released by China's National Health Commission [6] , and comply with World Health Organization interim guidance [7] . Mild cases were defined when patients only presented with mild symptoms and did not have a radiographic appearance of pneumonia. Moderate cases were defined when patients presented with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and have a radiographic appearance of pneumonia. Severe cases were defined when patients presented with one of the followings, 1) respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/minute; 2) finger oxygen saturation \u2264 93% at resting state; 3) partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) \u2264 300mmHg. Critical cases were defined when patients presented with one of the following, 1) respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation; 2) shock occurs; 3) other organ failure occurs and should be admitted to the intensive care unit [6] . Progression would be determined once the severity got worse, the date was recorded to calculate the interval between admission date and progression date. Severe/critical disease condition on admission and unchanged severity at the endpoint assessment was not classified as progression. Clinical features, laboratory findings, treatments, as well as clinical outcomes (ie. Discharge, the severity of the disease, mortality, length of stay) of patients were recorded and monitored up to March 1 st , 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of both hospitals (The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou 42016803-T, Xiangyang Central Hospital 2020-001). Written informed consent was waived due to the emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

As for mild/moderate patients, 214 (84.6%) were treated only with medical treatment as initial therapy (antiviral therapy combined with as needed antibiotics, expectorant, Chinese patent medicines, etc.), while 39 (15.4%) received both medical treatment and low-flow oxygen inhalation. All of the 48 severe/critical patients received both medical treatment and oxygen therapy, including 22 (45.8%) low-flow oxygen inhalation, 15 (31.3%) high-flow inhalation, 8 (16.7%) non-invasive ventilation, 3 (6.2%) invasive ventilation.",
