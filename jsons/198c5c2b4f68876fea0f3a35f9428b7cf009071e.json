Methods and Results: Virus was applied to the hands of volunteers and sampled by the glove juice method with 1\u00c15% beef extract (BE), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0\u00c101 and 0\u00c11% Tween 80, tryptic soy broth (TSB) and 9% NaCl. Each volunteer underwent multiple rounds application and hand sampling. Mean log 10 virus loss across trials was 2\u00c16 for BE, 2\u00c18 for PBS, 2\u00c14 for TSB, 3\u00c18 for NaCl, 3\u00c10 for 0\u00c11% Tween 80, and 2\u00c19 for 0\u00c101% Tween 80. Within each volunteer, there was a decline in viral loss from the first to last trial. Conclusions: These eluents can recover \u03a66 from hands with approx. 2-3 log 10 loss, comparable to recoveries previously reported for influenza. Protein and detergent-based eluents may have similar recoveries, but recovery may still vary across repeated sampling. Significance and Impact of the Study: Based on current work, protein-based eluents such as beef extract can maximize recovery of enveloped viruses during hand sampling, providing methods for evaluating survival and transmission of enveloped viruses on hands.

We conducted experiments to determine if virus remained on hands after hand hygiene with nonantibacterial soap followed by decontamination with 70% ethanol, and no virus was detected during sampling following hand decontamination (data not shown). Also, if trial-to-trial carryover was an important contributor to the amount of virus recovered, we would expect to see a continual decrease in virus loss across multiple trials as the amount of virus accumulated with each trial. Our results do not suggest that this is the case; the differences seen appear to be chiefly between trial 1 and the subsequent ones; trials 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were not found to be significantly different from each other regardless of which eluent was used. It is possible that changes to the skin as a result of hand hygiene and sampling take place during the first trial. This may change the skin surface in some way that is either more conducive to viral survival or less conducive to viral attachment, leading to decreases in virus loss after the first trial. It has been suggested that natural skin oils on hands may affect influenza survival (Grayson et al. 2008) ; one possibility is that the reduction in oils on the surface of the skin from sampling and hand hygiene may create a more favourable environment for the survival of viruses on hands or a less favourable environment for viral attachment to the skin, leading to decreased virus loss after trial 1. However, it is difficult to say for certain what this effect is without measurements of what is happening on the surface of the hand, such as measurements of skin oils or skin drying. One possible study design to determine why trial effects are seen would be to have each volunteer participate twice. During their first participation, all six trials would be run with virus, as in the work described here. In their second participation, trial #1 would be run as usual, but with virus-free liquid applied to the hands. Trials 2-6 would then be conducted as usual, with virus. This would give some insight into whether the application of eluent solution alone during trial 1 is causing some changes in the skin that would lead to decreased virus loss in subsequent trials. Measurements of skin change (such as changes in skin oils or skin drying using conductance and capacitance measures) would also help determine whether skin changes are playing a role.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1249, "end": 1270, "text": "(Grayson et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "For viruses, the stability of the lipid envelope and any surface proteins is likely to be the major factor determining inactivation by sampling methods, so results from \u03a66 are likely to be generalizable to other enveloped viruses with surface proteins. For effective sampling of enveloped viruses thought needs to be given to the effects of multiple sampling on the same individual; further exploration is needed of the effect of replicate sampling, eluent and changes to the skin surface on recovery from whole-hand sampling. The results of this work suggest that protein and polysorbate-based eluent solutions can recover an enveloped surrogate virus from hands during whole hand sampling; future work should evaluate protein-detergent combinations to determine if synergistic effects between the two can boost recovery. Based on current work, protein-based eluents such as beef extract can maximize recovery of enveloped viruses during hand sampling using the glove juice method.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [],
