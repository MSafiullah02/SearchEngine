Hospital-based outbreaks of RSV infection in HSCT recipients occur through introduction of circulating community strains as well as nosocomial transmission of identical viral strains [10]. The molecular epidemiology of RSV is characterized by sequencing a hypervariable region of the attachment (G) glycoprotein gene 11, 12. Evidence of acquisition of the same viral strain in inpatient cancer care settings has demonstrated the importance of specific infection control policies to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission, although data describing this in the outpatient setting are not available [13]. Studies have shown outpatient transmission of parainfluenza, a respiratory virus also associated with high mortality in immunocompromised cancer patients [14].",

Previous studies in inpatient settings have shown that the number of RSV-positive cases decreased after implementation of these infection control interventions [17]. However, most cancer care is now delivered in the outpatient setting. The routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factors has reduced many risks associated with prolonged neutropenia and prolonged hospital stays [18]. It has been assumed that outpatients generally acquire their respiratory infections in the community through routine daily activities, such as work and exposure to children, and not through contact within the health care setting. Few data are currently available on transmission of RSV infection in the outpatient cancer care setting. In this study molecular virologic methods were used to demonstrate nosocomial transmission of RSV during 2 RSV outbreaks at a large outpatient cancer care center.",

This plan designated 3 levels of infection control measures (Figure 2\n), with the immediate enforcement of Level 3 precautions starting January 1, 2008 (Figure 1A). As part of this plan, all patients, staff, and visitors to the clinic were screened for the presence of respiratory symptoms in the prior week using the 12-symptom respiratory screening questionnaire. Symptomatic persons were placed in respiratory isolation and a nasal wash for respiratory virus testing was collected. Of 51 cases of RSV identified in patients, 42 (82%) patients were HSCT recipients and 9 (18%) had hematologic or solid organ malignancies (Table 1\n). In the week before RSV detection, 33 patients (65%) were seen only in the outpatient clinic, whereas 7 (14%) were hospitalized and 11 (22%) had no associated health care visits. One of 11 subjects with no associated health care visits attended childcare; the others did not indicate recent sick contacts.",

In an inpatient study by Lavergne et al. [17], measures that included restriction of visitors with respiratory symptoms, droplet isolation precautions, and use of gowns, gloves, and masks by all patients, staff, and visitors were associated with a .09 relative risk of RSV as compared with a more traditional infection control policy. The interventions we implemented in an outpatient setting including heightened symptom surveillance of employees, visitors, and patients at every entry point to the clinic and the strict restriction from access to the clinic based on a positive symptom screen, use of gowns and gloves, and droplet isolation precautions of all clinic patients with respiratory symptoms. We observed that the number of new cases decreased after the intervention in 2008 despite continued high levels of community RSV activity as well as steady numbers of patient visits at the SCCA, suggesting that implementation of our strategy was effective in reducing the magnitude of the outbreak. In 2012, the magnitude of the outbreak was limited due to strict reinforcement of Level 2 precautions rather than escalation to Level 3 precautions. It is possible that Level 3 precautions would not have been necessary in 2008 if heightened enforcement of Level 2 precautions had been strictly enforced at that time as well.",

            "text": "A study limitation is that we were unable to sequence most samples from the 2 outbreaks. Many samples were inadvertently discarded at the end of the RSV season and were not available for sequencing, including all employee samples. Possibilities for the inability to sequence the remainder of the samples include low viral loads and sample degradation. In the 2007-2008 outbreak in particular, only samples early in the outbreak were sequenced. It is therefore not possible to know whether the cases later in the season were due to continued transmission of the outbreak strain or to sporadic community cases. Additionally, no samples were collected from visitors or family members. These data may have provided additional information regarding the degree of clonal transmission by health care providers and family members in the outbreaks. We also acknowledge no clear epidemiologic data linking outbreak cases. However, in our center, there are multiple sites of potential interaction between patients and care providers, including radiology, phlebotomy, and waiting areas for clinics. Although not documented, we believe these interactions may provide potential exposures of patients to sick employees, and vice versa. It is also possible that the clustering of the RSV strains during the 2 outbreaks was a reflection of the dominant strain circulating during the season in the region. The molecular epidemiology of RSV usually involves 1 dominant strain that circulates over the course of a season 34, 35. However, we found clustering of samples from both outbreaks distinct from co-circulating community strains collected during the same period, making this less likely. Increased sampling and detection during periods of the RSV outbreak may have been partially due to heightened awareness among providers, leading to potential sampling bias. Further, although we observed decreases in numbers of new cases after implementation of our infection control plan, we were unable to document efficacy of the intervention due to the retrospective observational nature of the study.",
