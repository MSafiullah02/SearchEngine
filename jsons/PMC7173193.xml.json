These T cells produce cytokines, which promote stimulation of B cells to produce IgE specific for that antigen (allergen). When two IgE antibodies are cross-linked by binding to specific epitopes of the allergen, degranulation of the attached (at the Fc receptor) mast cell occurs with resultant mediator release. The allergic reaction exhibits a biphasic response characterized by release of prostaglandin (PG) D2, tosyl-L-arginine methyl esterase (TAME-esterase), kinins, and histamine immediately from mast cells and the same mediators (except PGD2) from basophils 3 to 6 hours later.75 Cytokines IL-3, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-10 promote IgE and mast cell production.3 Additionally, IL-4 and IL-13 promote production of IgE, whereas {gamma} interferon and IL-12 oppose IgE production.7 The mast cell also enhances IgE production by producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6.11\n",

Other components of nasal secretions include antibodies (especially IgA), macroglobulin, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and mucus cell glycoproteins. Histamine also activates glandular hypersecretion via nocioceptive-parasympathetic reflexes to produce mucus.3 Nonallergic stimulation of the afferent pathway from nasal sensory receptors results in cholinergic stimulation via the efferent pathway to the nasal goblet cells resulting in further rhinorrhea.

Typically, spring allergens are caused by tree pollen, late-spring and summer symptoms by grass pollen, and fall symptoms by weed pollenosis.

Staining the nasal secretion for eosinophils with Hansel's stain can suggest a cause, but it is not specific for allergic rhinitis.73 Irritant rhinitis as well as infectious rhinitis produce neutrophils predominantly. Total IgE levels and complete blood cell counts are insufficient in predicting whether a patient is allergic or not and should not be used as screening tools. Skin testing or radioallergosorbent (RAST) testing should be used to confirm suspicions but should not be relied on to make a diagnosis. Because of the lability of allergens used in skin testing as well as variability in skin test responses and their interpretation, testing should be performed by board-certified allergists who are experienced in recognizing conditions that produce false-positive reactions. Intradermal testing should be limited because of over-interpretation of test results with concentrations that elicit irritant responses.8 Likewise, over-reliance on mildly positive RAST results for diagnosis and therapy may erroneously perpetuate the notion of an allergy to a patient. Such false impressions are long-lasting in most patients who desire a diagnosis for their complaints. Finally, provocation-neutralization testing, set end-point titration, and RAST for IgG specific for food antigens or Candida are all controversial and have not been shown to provide reliable evidence of allergy.100\n",

Within a few days, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and a sore (\u201cscratchy\u201d) throat predominate.103 A clue to viral origin is the serial transmission from person-to-person (as seen in spouses),28 as well as greater incidence of affected patients in the community than expected for allergies (typically one in five patients for the latter). The predominant cells on nasal smears after rhinovirus infection include polymorphonuclear leukocytes and, rarely, desquamated ciliated epithelial cells.110 Although kinins IL-6 and IL-8 are increased in symptomatic patients with rhinovirus infection, there are no significant increases in either histamine or prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in nasal secretions.48 It is for this reason that first-generation antihistamines have been shown to have relatively little efficacy in symptom control (except for their anticholinergic side-effects in drying the mucosa). Rhinoviruses bind to cells via a receptor known as the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1),41 which plays a prominent role in the inflammatory response. Symptoms of viral infections usually improve within 7 to 10 days, and if not (or if symptoms worsen after initial clearing), then secondary bacterial sinusitis should be considered.",

Other factors include rapid changes in temperature, humidity, or bright lights that elicit nasal symptoms (vasomotor instability). Gustatory rhinitis occurs when patients report clear rhinorrhea after eating any food (but more likely either hot or spicy foods).79 Irritant rhinitis results from stimulation of nasal receptors by odors, dust particles, or smoke, inducing clear rhinorrhea with resultant sneezing and nasal congestion.

Allergic rhinitis typically affects 20% of the population and is associated with a history consistent with immediate hypersensitivity and a familial history. Because of the various release of mediators other than histamine, the medications required for treatment of allergic rhinitis should focus on control of the inflammatory response. Intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective, although the newer less- or nonsedating antihistamines have some anti-inflammatory properties. Side effects of these medications are infrequent but need to be considered when prescribing. Avoidance techniques for allergen exposure also need to be followed.
