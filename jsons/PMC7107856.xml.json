We also accounted for within-household clustering while assessing vaccine effect by using generalized-linear-mixed models (GLMMs) for binary outcomes, adjusting for the same covariates [6]. Because surveillance data suggested that children experienced higher pH1N1 attack rates and that older adults were at lower risk [7, 8], we explored vaccine effects stratified for participants aged <20 years and <50 years.

Inclusion of communities denced by other contributing viruses identified through passive where there was little or no circulation of pH1N1 would lead surveillance during the study period. We attempted to validate to outcome misclassification as evidenced by the low positive the ILI case definition on the basis of pH1N1-seropositive predictive value (38%) for the ILI case definition. We thus restricted analyses to households of the affected elementary school and on a reserve where pH1N1 circulation was more certain. This improved the positive predictive value of the ILI case definition in representing pH1N1-related illness (>60%), although some misclassification may have still occurred. The effect of any persisting misclassification due to a nonspecific outcome would be to underestimate the association between TIV and pH1N1 illness (ie, to drive the OR toward a null effect) [14].",

Repeated vaccination has been hypothesized to block potentially cross-protective immunity otherwise afforded by heterotypic infection [15\u201317]. Higher ORs among on-reserve Aboriginals could also reflect greater susceptibility to the effects of TIV on pH1N1 risk, although an analysis for interaction did not yield statistically significant results. Some studies have reported genetic polymorphisms that favor Th2 skew among Canadian Aboriginals with higher expression of interleukin-6 and lower production of tumor necrosis factor-a, interferon-g, and interleukin-10 that may be relevant to enhanced immune-mediated effects in this population [18]. Other studies have suggested that Aboriginal status is an independent risk factor for more severe pH1N1 outcomes, but we did not specifically assess that hypothesis [19]. However, higher ORs may also reflect the methodological influences of bias or confounding. Aboriginal populations are known to have higher rates of both chronic conditions and influenza vaccination [11\u201313]. To address this, we adjusted for comorbidity and conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to on-reserve participants without chronic conditions, resulting in similar or higher ORs. Despite these reassurances, neither residual confounding nor bias can be fully ruled out. As a final limitation, the sample sizes were small and confidence intervals were wide for stratified and serologically-confirmed analyses so that these in particular should be interpreted cautiously.",

In combination, these showed 1.4\u20132.5fold increased risk of medically attended, laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 illness among prior 2008\u20132009 TIV recipients [17]. An additional Canadian study using the linked Manitoba immunization registry and administrative databases has also shown similar findings of increased risk [4] (Dr Carole Beaudoin, Public Health Agency of Canada, personal communication). Thus, in Canada, 6 observational studies based on different methods and settings, including the current outbreak investigation, consistently showed increased risk of pH1N1 illness during the spring and summer of 2009 associated with prior receipt of the 2008\u20132009 TIV [4, 17]. Conversely, studies conducted outside of Canada have provided inconsistent results: 3 studies (from the United States and Australia) reported null effects [20\u201322], 4 (from the United States and Mexico) reported protective effects [23\u201326], and 1 other outbreak investigation (from the Untied States) reported increased risk [27].",

High rates of immunization and the use of a single domestic manufacturer to supply >75% of the TIV in Canada may have enhanced the power within Canada to detect a vaccine-specific effect. Given the changed immunologic landscape following the first springsummer pandemic wave and the mass pH1N1 vaccination campaign during the fall 2009, it may not be possible to further resolve this issue epidemiologically. Studies using animal models, banked serum samples, or other in vitro experiments are needed to further assess this association.",
