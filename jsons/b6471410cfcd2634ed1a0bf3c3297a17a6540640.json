As of April 5, there has been 1,267,174 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, of which 68,931 patients have died, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44% [3] . Coagulation dysfunction is one of the major causes for death in patients with severe COVID-19 [4] . Previous studies have shown that 71% of the patients who died have met the criteria set by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [5] . Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis gathered experts from the epidemic frontline of Wuhan to establish a committee to reach a consensus.

ACE2, the main target of the novel coronavirus, is mainly distributed in the heart, lungs, kidneys, testes, and digestive tract [8] . Therefore, the pathological results showed that SARS-CoV were detected in alveolar type II epithelial cells, monocytes, digestive tract epithelial cells, distal renal tubulesepithelial cells, skin sweat gland cells, parathyroid and pituitary eosinophils, adrenal cortex cells, gastric parietal cells, pancreatic acinar cells and tracheal serous gland cells. Different from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 were mainly detected in alveolar type II epithelial cells and pulmonary macrophages, and partly in hilar lymph nodes, spleens and testes [9] . Coronavirus has an extensive tissue distribution, causing a high number of proinflammatory cytokines to be released, promoting a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), accelerating cell death in the lungs, livers, heart, kidneys and the adrenal parenchymal organs, which can ultimately lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [10] . As inflammatory reactions occur in the all organs of the body, the microvascular system is damaged, leading to abnormal activation of the coagulation system, which pathologically manifests as generalised small vessel vasculitis and extensive microthrombosis [9, 11] .

Moreover, excessive depletion of coagulation substrates causes coagulation dysfunction leading to the development of DIC and even MOF. In order to reduce the coagulation substrate depletion, some experts suggested general COVID-19 patients should be given 1 to 2 doses of low molecular heparin daily, until the patient's DD level returns to normal. Once FDP \u2265 10 g/mL and/or DD \u2265 5 \u03bcg/mL, unfractionated heparin (3-15 IU/kg per hour) should be used.

Some researchers have conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 and discovered that using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulation for patients with a DD value greater than 6 timescan significantly reduce mortality, compared with those who have not received low-molecular-weight heparin treatment (not published).

Unfractionated heparin has the advantages of a short half-life, a convenient monitoring process and the fact that it can be neutralized with protamine. Therefore, it is recommended that unfractionated heparin should be the first choice. It is also recommended that unfractionated heparin should be administered intravenously. The dosage should be determined according to the coagulation function and organ function. Those with severe coagulation dysfunction can start with a low dose [1 U/(kg\u2022h)] and use laboratory indicators to guide titration. LMWH is not easy to adjust or monitor due to its long half-life, therefore it is recommended only to be used in mild to moderate coagulation dysfunction. The initial dose is generally recommended to be given as 1 mg/kg q12h intravenously or subcutaneously, and the dosage should be monitored according to anti-Xa activity with the target range of 0.6~1.0 IU/mL. LMWH is metabolized by the kidneys, and therefore, patients with kidney dysfunction need to be monitored. The ATIII activity of severe COVID-19 patients should be maintained at > 80%, otherwise it may affect the effect of the anticoagulant. If ATIII activity is reduced, it can be increased by supplementing fresh frozen plasma. In continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), anticoagulation methods can be divided into systemic anticoagulation, local anticoagulation and no anticoagulation. Systemic anticoagulation is a method that reduces the blood coagulation by using anticoagulant drugs intravenously. Local anticoagulation is a method that only reduces the blood coagulation in the extracorporeal circuit without affecting the blood coagulation in the body. If circuit anticoagulation is the goal, local anticoagulation or systemic anticoagulation can be used. If patient anticoagulation is the goal, systemic anticoagulation is recommended to alter the coagulation status for treatment of the primary disease. To avoid an increased risk of bleeding, the dose of anticoagulant drugs needs to be adjusted according to the patient's coagulation status. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is shown in Table 3 . The blood status of the patient needs to be monitored within 6 h of anticoagulant administration, and then monitored regularly depending on the severity of their condition. A TEG heparinase comparison test is recommended to titrate unfractionated heparin dosage with the R/Rh ratio as 2 [27] . It is a good method to titrate the dose of unfractionated heparin according to the change of APTT, TEG R-time or Sonoclot/Centuryclot ACT from the previous base value. Protamine can be considered in the case of a severe heparin overdose. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin can be repeated with a bolus or by continuous pumping. It is recommended that a repeated bolus should initially be an intravenous dose of 60~80 IU/kg, taken 20~30 min before treatment, with an additional intravenous dose of 30~40 IU/kg taken every 4~6 hours. The additional doses should be gradually reduced as the treatment period goes on. The activity of plasma anti-Xa should be monitored and maintained at 0.3 IU/ml, and the LMWH dose should be adjusted based on the results. The LMWH rate of continuous pumping also needs to be adjusted based on the measurements of the plasma anti-Xa activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 133, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2560, "end": 2564, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2263, "end": 2270, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Recommendation 6: Anticoagulant therapy can be utilized without anticoagulant contraindications in severe COVID-19 patients with thrombosis"}, {"text": "Recommendation 10: Topical citrate anticoagulation is recommended for severe COVID-19 patients with active bleeding who require CRRT Severe COVID-19 patients with active bleeding who require CRRT should be treated with local citrate anticoagulation to avoid aggravating coagulation disorders. 4% trisodium citrate solution should be continuously administered before the filter at a dose of 1.2 to 1.5 times the blood flow rate (ml/min). The citric acid concentration before the filter should reach 3 to 4 mmol/L, the free calcium after the filter should be maintained at 0.25 0.35 mmol/L and the venous free calcium should be at 1.1~1.35 mmol/L. The citric acid dose should be adjusted depending on the concentration of the ionized calcium concentration after the filter, and the calcium chloride or calcium gluconate solution dose should be adjusted depending on the serum ionized calcium concentration in the body [28] . critically ill COVID-19 patients. Heparin is the most commonly used anticoagulant in ECMO adjuvants, but it also increases the risk of bleeding [29] . Bleeding in severe COVID-19 patients with coagulation dysfunction is more common at surgical incision or ECMO intubation sites, in the nose and in airways. Gastrointestinal bleeding can also occur, the most serious of which is intracranial bleeding. Therefore, in severe COVID-19 patients with coagulation dysfunction, there needs to be increased monitoring of the coagulation function during ECMO adjuvants. Monitoring methods commonly involve activated clotting time (ACT) and APTT. ACT should be maintained at 180~220 s and/or ACT and APTT should be maintained at 1.5 times the normal upper limit. The TEG heparinase comparison test is also applicable to ECMO anticoagulation monitoring [30] . For detailed methods refer to 'Recommendation 8'.

It mainly manifests as thrombocytopenia, as well as venous and arterial thrombosis, and even death. Literature review shows that the incidence of HIT is approximately 0.1% to 5.0%, and the incidence is higher with unfractionated heparin use than with LMWH use [31] . HIT is mainly caused by platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin complex, which stimulates immune cells to produce PF4-heparin complex antibodies (i.e., HIT antibodies), which in turn leads to persistent platelet activation, activation of the coagulation pathway, platelet thrombosis, and fibrin thrombus. If a severe case of COVID-19 leads to a decrease in the platelet count at > 50% of the basal value and/or shows signs of arteriovenous thrombosis after an administration of heparin, the 4 T's score or HIT antibody can be used to diagnose HIT. The 4T's score is a validated clinical prediction tool for HIT, and it is composed of elements related to the degree of thrombocytopenia, the time to thrombocytopenia from heparin product exposure, the associated thrombotic complications and the concurrent presence of other potential etiologies of thrombocytopenia. A score \u2264 3 is classified as low likelihood of HIT, 4~5 is moderate, and 6~8 is highly possible.
