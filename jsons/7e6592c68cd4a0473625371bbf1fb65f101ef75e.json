The increasing need of high-throughput virus sensing is emerging due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) outbreak. This letter focuses on increasing the awareness academic institutions about the possibility of incorporating vibrational spectroscopy techniques (Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy) for healthcare, especially motivating researchers to address COVID-19 related topics. We believe that those techniques are sensitive to the virus and can assist in the early and fast diagnosis to contain the new pandemic.",

Since the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by direct routes including cough, sneeze, and droplet inhalation and contact routes such as contact with nasal, oral, and eye mucous membranes, the virus has been proven to be pr esent on human biofluids [3] . Biofluids include saliva, blood, and possibly sputum, tears, and wound secretion, which contain specific disease biomarkers such as pro teins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, hormones, phosphate, carotenoids. Biomarkers are present in coronaviruses, as their constitution comprises a single strand of positive-sense RNA involved by structural proteins/glycoprotein and lipids of their nucleocapsid, matrix and envelope. In addition, the S protei n from coronavirus can bind to the host cellmembrane receptors to facilitate viral entry into cells including the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [2] . These biomarkers can be targeted by molecular specific diagnostic tests such as vibrational spectroscopy.",

Raman spectroscopy is highly specific and can be used to analyze biofluids samples directly or to analyze the virus binding on ACE2 receptors of the host cells. In this case, exfoliative cytology or c ell cultures may allow another potential diagnostic option for cell analysis.

Due to the portability and low-noise measurements provided by FT-IR ATR spectroscopy, it can be widely used for cost-effective mass screening at hospitals, clinics, airports, among other places. The strong molecular specificity and water-free signals of Raman spectroscopy allows the technique to be used for biochemical profiling of cells in biofluids and cell cultures. The analysis of cell biochemistry can be relatively fast in order to provide the intracellular changes correlated to the disease, especially molecular-specific associations between the host cell and the virus. These changes can be further related to the pathophysiology of the patients in the clinic and investigation of new treatment/containment modalities.",
