COVID-19 is caused by novel SARS-CoV-2, which, to a certain degree, possesses genomic similarities to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (2, 3).",

Google\u2122 has created a platform that collects and aggregates anonymous data on trends of individuals' mobility within the community across different countries using data from Google maps, aiming to support health officials and policy makers during this pandemic (23). As of the 11th of April 2020, Google mobility charts showed that individuals' mobility in Jordan has been effectively reduced during the curfew. Interestingly, the mobility around highly crowded spots was reduced: retail and recreation centers have seen a reduction by 93% compared to the baseline, grocery stores have seen a reduction by 89% compared to the baseline, and workplaces have seen a reduction by 81% compared to the baseline (23). The data from these mobility charts show that the governmental restrictions on individual's movements were effective and successful despite the few hundreds of violations that happened at the beginning of the curfew (24).",

Despite the limited number of violations that happened during the curfew, the Jordanian public showed high levels of commitment and awareness, as reflected by the slow pace of COVID-19 spread inside the country, and this implies that majority of the public have adopted the recommended preventive and control measures successfully. Different societal responsibilities, including social distancing, frequent hand washing and sanitization, as well as complying with the recommendations from health authorities, will all result in a more effective national response to limit the spread of the disease, especially upon the release of the current lockdown and curfew in Jordan.",

However, the process of returning to normal life after releasing the lockdown and curfew is also challenging to both decision makers and the society. Early reduction and easing up of governmental interventions and restrictions might lead to adverse impacts in causing a subsequent strike of COVID-19 (27). Looking at the fact that effective antiviral medications and vaccines are still lacking, the Jordanian decision makers should not ignore the possible scenario of a serious subsequent strike with COVID-19 cases after ending the current lockdown and curfew considering the slow pace of COVID-19 spread and the undeveloped population-scale immunity. Thus, plans for managing a possible \u201csecond wave\u201d of infections must be incorporated into the lockdown and curfew exit strategy (26), and this should be supported by simulations of the effects of different public health measures to predict future scenarios (27). Bearing that in mind, the Jordanian public have a tremendous responsibility in terms of adapting to the COVID-19 preventive measures and implementing them as a new normal lifestyle, especially in the period following the lockdown and curfew.",

At this early stage and the uncertain future scenarios, it is difficult to critically compare the effectiveness of various COVID-19 response strategies at different contexts despite the fact that the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Jordan are much lower than in most of the neighboring countries. However, during and after the battle of COVID-19, countries, including Jordan, must take more serious steps to strengthen and improve their healthcare system capacity in order to be well-prepared for such crises in the future (28, 29).
