It is estimated that 10 million new cases of TB occurred in 2017 and about one-quarter of the world population has latent TB [59]. In Korea, both TB and PNTM burden have increased, which leads to the speculation that previous history of TB cause structural lung damage and increase the vulnerability to PNTM [60] (Table 2).(b)Cystic fibrosis",

For example, in the case of structural lung defects, specific gene defects [mentioned in \u201cCystic fibrosis\u201d and \u201cImpaired mucociliary clearance\u201d subsections] have been described [74]. Specific gene defects associated with immunodeficiencies will be described in the next subsection. Defects on CHP2 gene have been associated to PNTM due to MAC [78]. Genetic defects in genes related with immune response, CFTR, cilia, and connective tissue have been found with increased frequency in PNTM patients compared with their unaffected family members and control subjects. Many of the patients had simultaneous defects in various genes, comprising of different categories [79]. Evidence of genetic linkage on chromosome 6q12-q16 with PNTM and the identification of TTK as a candidate gene for PNTM have been found in PNTM patients [80]. Also, haplotypic association with PNTM has been reported [81]. Some studies showed association of different HLA antigens and susceptibility to PNTM. In this regard, HLA-A33, HLA-DR6 and the haplotype A33-B44-DR6 were found with higher frequency in PNTM, and the presence of HLA-A26 has been associated with a bad clinical evolution [82, 83]. The studies related with the genetic defects associated with PNTM support the notion that PNTM is a complex, multifactorial disease with the simultaneous presence of several concomitant genetic alterations [79] (Table 2).",

Pectus excavatum, a skeletal feature of rickets, is related to hypovitaminosis D, as this vitamin is essential for maintenance of healthy bones [166]. The development of lungs is also affected by the vitamin D level and deficiency of this vitamin may lead to deficits in lung function and volume [167]. In bronchiectasis patients, 50% have vitamin D deficiency and are frequently colonized with bacteria [168]. Generally, the level of vitamin D decreases with increasing age and decreased exposure to sunlight [169]. All the factors previously mentioned have been linked with PNTM; however, studies related with the link between vitamin D and PNTM are relatively scarce. Association of severe vitamin D deficiency and PNTM has been reported [162]. However, in another study, Fujita et al. (2018) showed association of vitamin D with bone mineral density and antimicrobial peptide levels (hCAP18/LL-37), without a direct link between the serum vitamin D level and PNTM [170].",

Although transmission of NTM from human-to-human is not common, in 2010, a first case of M. kansasii isolated from a couple in East London, an area with high TB burden, was reported [231]. The isolates were genetically identical, and the authors were unable to prove a shared domestic exposure [231]. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed the possibilities of human-to-human transmission, but most probably in an indirect manner via fomite contamination or inhalation of NTM in airborne water droplets [232]. Contamination of the environment after natural disasters and human mobility might be associated with PNTM transmission [233\u2013236] (Table 2).Water",

In centralized water supply systems, water travels long distances, which eventually leads to degradation of the disinfectants, i.e. decrease in chlorine concentrations due to heat inactivation [239]. Also, a study showed that despite addition of ozonation and filtration treatments, NTM can still persist in water systems [240]. NTM can be recovered in water with free and total chlorine levels of 2.5 and 2.8 mg/l, respectively, suggesting that chlorination is unable to efficiently kill mycobacteria [241]. One of the main reasons that mycobacteria can survive in this harsh environment is their ability to form a protective shield, biofilm [229]. In potable water, slow growing MAC form a highly culturable biofilm compared to RGM, suggesting that the former has better adaptation to growth in low-nutrient environments [229]. Also, M. avium is able to survive and grow in free-living amoeba, particularly Acanthamoeba lenticulata as parasites or endosymbionts, and the encystment protect M. avium from the disinfection processes [336]. Water treatment has always been focused on eliminating water-borne gastrointestinal bacteria such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella and Escherichia coli but not in the elimination of mycobacteria [337]. Considering the ability of mycobacteria to survive in these harsh environments even after treatment, a more appropriate water treatment plan is needed as the consequences of NTM infection should not be overlooked. A study by Inkinen et al. (2016) suggested that cooper pipelines might be effective in preventing NTM colonization compared to polyethylene pipelines [338].",

Such criteria are needed because NTM exists naturally in the environment, and isolation of NTM from non-sterile respiratory specimens does not confirm that the organism is the causative agent for lung disease [344]. High-TB burden countries are normally those of the low to middle income countries (LMIC), where resources for microbiological culture using the traditional diagnostic TB gold standard either on solid L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Jensen medium or liquid culture [Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT)], are limited. Thus, sputum smear microscopy is the most important test used for TB diagnosis [345]. With the current rise of PNTM infections, the non-specific microscopic testing, which detects all acid-fast bacilli, cannot differentiate between PNTM or TB infection. The application of chest X-ray screening to predict the presence of TB or PNTM remains subjective. As recommended by ATS/IDSA, PNTM can be diagnosed based on nodular or cavitary opacities on chest radiography [332]. Gommans et al. (2015) studied 83 PNTM patients showing that cavities were observed most frequently, while consolidations were a predictor for risk of mortality [346]. A radiographic study on 108 TB and 25 PNTM patients showed that the presence of honeycomb appearance (characteristic appearance of variably sized cysts in a background of densely scarred lung tissue) is significant in PNTM patients; consolidation, miliary nodules, cavities, atelectasis, fibrothorax and mediastinal widening are more common in TB patients; and pleural effusion, pleural lesions, and reticulonodular infiltration are observed in both TB and PNTM patients [347]. Therefore, the confirmation of PNTM in LMIC remains a diagnostic challenge for microbiologists and clinicians.",

According to ATS/IDSA, besides Runyon classification, genotypic identification of NTM can be done using acridium ester-labelled DNA probes targeting 16S rRNA, DNA sequencing of 16S rDNA, and PCR restriction endonuclease activity targeting hsp65 [332]. Also, WHO has recommended one nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), NTM + MDR-TB Detection Kit 2 (Nipro Co., Japan) using LPA [280]. Other NAATs commercially available to detect NTM and drug resistance are included in Table 2 [281\u2013290]. Detecting drug resistance in the early phase of diagnosis can help determine better treatment options for patients with the possibility to eradicate the infection in shorter time (Table 3).",

The application of WGS helps to detect these variants for proper management of the patients [350] and it is also able to detect the potential mode of transmission either from individuals or environment [232].(b)Treatment",

A study of 12 SGM and 12 RGM with 15 antimicrobial drugs showed that 24, 16 and 8 strains were resistant to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF) and streptomycin (STR), respectively [351]. The authors concluded that STR, amikacin (AMK), the fluoroquinolones (FQs), and the tetracyclines (TET) are the most effective antimicrobial agents against the 24 strains [351]. A study of 95 NTM strains with ten drugs showed that ethambutol (EMB) is the most useful agent against NTM, but its resistance rate among the tested strains was around 42% [352]. The emergence of multidrug resistant NTM (which can be resistant to five or more antimicrobial drugs) has also complicated the treatment [353]. Thus, according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, different drugs or combination of drugs should be used to treat different species [236]. For example, treatment of MAC lung disease with RIF, EMB and macrolides [clarithromycin (CLR) or azithromycin (AZM)]; treatment of M. kansasii lung disease with RIF, EMB and macrolides; treatment of M. xenopi lung disease with RIF, EMB, macrolides and FQs/INH; and treatment M. abscessus lung disease with AMK, tigecycline (TGC), imipenem (IPM) and macrolide is recommended [236].",
