Given the corresponding high burden of infection, it is unsurprising that the consumption of antimicrobial agents (antibacterials, antifungals and antivirals) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is ten times higher than in other wards [1] . It is essential to optimise the use of antimicrobial agents not only to maximise therapeutic success but also to prolong the clinical lifespan of these currently available drugs by limiting the emergence of resistance [2] . However, the process of optimising antimicrobial therapy (including both spectrum and therapeutic exposure) is a massive challenge in ICU patients, who often manifest extreme inter-and intraindividual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability [3] . It follows that conventional antimicrobial dosing may risk clinical failure in this patient population as most dose-finding studies only included non-ICU populations. Indeed, perhaps more than in any other patient population, nonoptimised antimicrobial dosing may more commonly lead to low drug exposure and therapeutic failure and/or antimicrobial resistance [4] , or high drug exposure, leading to an increased risk of toxicity.",

Traditionally, TDM was only employed to minimise the likelihood of toxicity in drugs with narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. aminoglycosides and vancomycin) and in drugs with complex pharmacokinetics (e.g. voriconazole) and has been hitherto underused for other antimicrobials. However, the recent surge in multidrug-resistant pathogens causing infections, combined with a declining antimicrobial pipeline, is causing a need to revise this approach. TDM of antimicrobials, even for those with a wide therapeutic index, is becoming more common [5, 6] , whilst TDM for the \"traditional\" drugs, such as aminoglycosides and glycopeptides, is continually being studied for further improvement.",

Such patients require intensive monitoring and treatment due to failure of vital organ functions (due to acute and/or chronic disease) or due to the sequelae of surgical or other intensive treatment associated with lifethreatening conditions. Critical illness is characterised by marked homoeostatic changes, driven by both the underlying disease process and the interventions required. These features profoundly affect organ function, resulting in a pathophysiological state that is not encountered in an ambulatory setting. Moreover, the presence of chronic comorbidity can further exacerbate the pathophysiological changes commonly encountered during critical illness. All of these factors will significantly influence antimicrobial PK in the critically ill and can be broadly considered in terms of altered volume of distribution (V d ) and drug clearance (CL).",

This is closely linked to the severity of the underlying disease process and the degree of systemic inflammation. Sepsis and major burn injury are classic examples. This is then further exacerbated by intravenous (IV) fluid loading, a near-ubiquitous intervention in the ICU. For hydrophilic antimicrobials (e.g. acyclovir, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, daptomycin, fluconazole and glycopeptides), this can result in a significantly expanded V d [7] . Changes in protein binding associated with hypoalbuminaemia will also potentially influence antimicrobial PK [8] . Indeed, hypoalbuminaemia is commonly encountered (as a negative acute phase reactant), resulting in an increase in the V d for highly protein-bound antimicrobials, such as ceftriaxone, daptomycin, ertapenem, flucloxacillin and teicoplanin [8] . In these scenarios, the free (or unbound) fraction is increased, resulting in both greater distribution and potentially CL. Finally, extremes of body size and composition (typically obesity) will also influence V d , although the magnitude of any such change will depend on the physicochemical properties of the antimicrobial (e.g. molecular weight, lipid solubility and degree of ionisation) [9] .",

In this context, critical illness can have a profound impact on renal function and therefore drug CL. Augmented renal clearance (ARC) is being increasingly noted in critically ill sub-populations (incidence of 14-80%) [10] . ARC is defined as an increased creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min/1.73 m 2 measured by 8-24-h urine collection and refers to the enhanced renal elimination of circulating solute (such as metabolic waste and drugs) [11] . The underlying mechanisms are uncertain, although increased solute delivery related to a hyperdynamic high cardiac output state, in combination with tubular and/or neuroendocrine changes, is likely implicated [10] . Identifying patients with ARC is challenging as these patients may have elevated renal function despite normal serum creatinine concentrations [12] , and importantly, commonly used glomerular filtration rate mathematical estimates, such as the Cockcroft-Gault and Modified Diet in Renal Disease equations, are unlikely to be reliable as compared to urinary creatinine clearance data [13] . Younger patients with multiple trauma are at the highest risk [12] , but ARC has also been described in other patient categories. Moreover, the presence of ARC has been associated with sub-optimal plasma antimicrobial concentrations [11] , although the implications in terms of clinical outcomes remain unclear [14] .",

This relationship can be described by relating the PK exposure of an antimicrobial to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the offending pathogen. Antimicrobials classically have different PK/PD indices [19] , and these can be categorised as: (a) the ratio of maximum drug concentration (C max ) to MIC (C max /MIC); (b) the duration of time (T) that the free drug concentration remains above the MIC during a dosing interval (fT >MIC ); and (c) the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve during a 24-hour period to MIC (AUC 0-24 /MIC) [20] . However, it is also important to note that individual MICs were rarely measured in most of the earlier studies and parameters such as MIC 50 and MIC 90 were used instead to describe the PK/PD relationships. For antivirals, in particular, measures other than the MIC have been used as the denominator of the PK/PD index such as the in vitro concentration required to obtain 50% of the maximum effect (EC 50 ). The denominator in these indices is an important consideration because when it increases, the corresponding PK exposure should also be increased to ensure that the optimal PK/PD index is still achieved. This is mostly relevant in the ICU as at least bacterial pathogens may demonstrate higher MICs, as much as 2-4 times higher, when compared to the general wards [21] .",

Therefore, an individual MIC measurement should only be regarded as an estimate and not a \"true\" value of a pathogen's susceptibility. MIC may vary according to determination methods (e.g. broth microdilution vs. E-test \u00ae ), and it is therefore important to aim for an appropriate MIC method-specific target, with broth microdilution (BMD) MIC being the preferred method, if they are available. Any potential dosing adjustments with the aid of TDM must consider MIC variation and should be interpreted in the context of assay variation, species identification and wild-type distributions. Measures of MIC distributions such as epidemiologic cut-off (ECOFF) values, which separate bacterial populations into those of a wild-type population and those with either a low-or high-level phenotypically detectable resistance, can be more useful to guide antibacterial dosing. Mouton et al. proposed several practical solutions in their review to optimise antibacterial dosing for patients, and one of the important recommendations included the use of ECOFF values as the PD target for dosing purposes when the measured MIC for the bacterial strain is within the wild-type distribution [22] . If the MIC is slightly above the ECOFF, a two-fold dilution of the MIC can be assumed for dosing purposes, whilst MIC-guided therapy should not be an option if the measured MIC is clearly far above the ECOFF and clinical resistance breakpoint.",

Whilst C min provides some information on drug CL, determination of V d requires an additional sample earlier in the dosing interval. For the estimation of derived PK parameters, such as the AUC, and PK/PD targets, such as the fT >MIC , an optimised PK sampling schedule is suggested for unbiased and precise parameter estimation. A limited sampling strategy (LSS), which uses the most \"informative\" concentration-time points (commonly 1-3 sampling time points) to describe a drug's PK, is relatively easy to be performed and may provide accurate estimates of full drug exposure [23, 24] . The optimal sampling time points for a drug can be identified during \"limited sampling\" studies where these time points will be estimated or calculated using PK models and Monte Carlo simulations. The time points can then be used to predict AUC 0-24 , and as such, this approach is beneficial for those antimicrobials in which AUC 0-24 /MIC ratios are the major determinants for efficacy. For example, although 10-15 time points are conventionally needed to calculate 80% of the total AUC, Alsultan et al. demonstrated that these can be reduced to only 2 time points (sampling at 4 and 6 h post-dose) with LSS to estimate levofloxacin AUC [25] .

Bayesian estimation is most accurate when an optimal sampling time is chosen to provide the most information about the drug's PK behaviour in the patient and a suitable population PK model matching the target population to serve as the Bayesian prior model [32] . After initial TDM, it is recommended to repeat TDM (within 1-2 days for most drugs) to confirm therapeutic exposures have been achieved and again thereafter if there are concerns of significant changes to PK (e.g. enteral absorption, renal function).",

Furthermore, there is currently conflicting data regarding the relationship between ribavirin exposures with therapeutic or toxic effects. However, it is important to note that as opposed to weight-based dosing, TDMguided ribavirin dosing has been shown to significantly improve sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 [227] . Although anaemia was more severe in the TDM group, it was well managed with erythropoietin beta. More recently, TDM has been suggested as a useful tool to guide ribavirin treatment in lung transplant recipients with paramyxovirus infection [232] .",

Empirical antimicrobial therapy should attempt to provide coverage against all likely pathogens (bacterial, fungal and/or viral) and effective exposures are needed in the interstitial fluid of tissues presumed to be the source of infection. As extreme pathophysiological changes are likely to affect antimicrobial exposures, factors associated with PK/PD alterations need to be determined and considered in critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock. Optimal antimicrobial exposures and PK/PD targets for patient benefits need to be further elucidated before appropriate dosing regimens and strategies can be improved in this population. The role of biomarkers as a surrogate for an antimicrobial response should be investigated as an earlier therapeutic intervention can be made rather than relying on clinical signs and symptoms [234, 235] .

Furthermore, in most ICUs, TDM is probably not available for all important antimicrobials and certainly, not for 24 h and 7 days a week [5, 6] . An easy-to-use chromatography-based method that enables rapid and reliable simultaneous determination of antimicrobial concentrations in plasma and tissues can be developed, and some are now being used routinely in clinical settings. Although concentration measurements are usually performed in blood matrices (e.g. plasma or serum), several alternative sampling strategies (e.g. dried blood spots and volumetric absorptive microsamples), which are minimally or non-invasive approaches, need to be further investigated and validated for routine TDM in critically ill patients. Importantly, these \"patient-friendly\" strategies may play an important role in the establishment of TDM centres in remote and resource-limited settings.",

TDM-guided dosing is the only safe and effective way to ensure that all critically ill patients achieve therapeutic antimicrobial exposures. TDM-guided dosing has been shown to be clinically beneficial for aminoglycosides, voriconazole and ribavirin. For most common antibiotics and antifungals in the ICU, a clear therapeutic range has been established and for these agents, routine TDM in critically ill patients may be useful. Specifically, we recommend routine TDM when one of these antibiotics or antifungals is used in critically ill patients: aminoglycosides, beta-lactam antibiotics, linezolid, teicoplanin, vancomycin and voriconazole. For the antivirals, urgent research is needed to identify therapeutic targets for patient benefits and to also ascertain whether antiviral TDM is indeed meritorious in this patient population. Although we believe that TDM should be the standard of care for most antimicrobials in every ICU, important barriers, such as the availability of bioanalytical experts and TDM equipments in an institution, need to be addressed before routine TDM can be widely employed worldwide.",
