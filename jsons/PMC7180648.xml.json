Both are likely to be used for much longer periods than the 5-7 days familiar to dental practitioners.1 These are NSAID drugs which are safely used by dentists in healthy individuals, but in certain medical conditions it is important that dentists are aware of the serious adverse effects that they can cause. Patients with asthma, renal disease, liver disease, allergy/angioedema, peptic ulcer disease, acute cardiac and stroke risk and cardiac failure are all groups where special caution is required when using NSAID analgesics. They are also not recommended for use into the third trimester of pregnancy. NICE has issued guidance to medical practitioners starting these medicines for longer term or high dose use and dentists would be well advised to look at this guidance until more specific dental focussed information is available.2 In many of these risk groups paracetamol is a safer alternative.",

Warfarinised patients should not routinely be given an NSAID. New oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban and dabigatran, are more tolerant of NSAID use although some platelet effects may cause mildly prolonged bleeding. High dose ibuprofen should not be used in patients taking aspirin 75 mg/day as it reduces the cardioprotective effect.3",

A stronger version of co-codamol (15/500) is available through a GP's prescription as are other opioid medicines. Where the dentist is unsure about providing high dose or long course analgesia, or when prescribing in the risk groups above, it is sensible to contact the patient's GP for advice before issuing the prescription.",
