Herds with a minimum of 100 milking cows or rearing a minimum of 15 calves per batch were included in the study. An outbreak of diarrhoea was defined as a minimum of 5% morbidity with calves exhibiting signs of systemic disease (e.g. poor appetite, dehydration, decreased mentation and reduced suckle reflex) and had pasty\u2013watery faeces. Herds were selected on the basis of the client calling a veterinary practice seeking assistance with an outbreak combined with practices actively advising clients to contact them if an outbreak of diarrhoea occurred. Twelve veterinary practices from the six states of Australia (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia), with a large number of dairy herds serviced by the practice were instructed on sample selection, sampling technique, storage and transport protocols.",

Protocols were designed to increase the likelihood of detecting the primary pathogens contributing to disease. For example, veterinarians were asked to select samples from calves that were showing signs of systemic illness with a duration of not more than 4 days. Isolation of causative agents is increased when animals are sampled early in the disease course and prior to the use of antibiotics that may lead to false negatives for bacterial pathogens. Histopathological evidence demonstrating pathology consistent with the enteropathogen isolated is desirable to establish a causal association and requests for postmortem samples from outbreaks were included in the instructions sent to practitioners. However, the number of postmortem samples collected was very small, possibly because of the extra time required to perform the procedures, the cost and time involved in revisiting a property to necropsy calves that died subsequent to the initial visit, the lack of suitable samples and the reluctance of farm managers to euthanase sick calves. Identification of an enteropathogen from the faeces of a calf does not constitute a definitive aetiological diagnosis. Sampling a group of affected calves provides more robust evidence when similar pathogens are identified in multiple animals.",

An argument against the use of qRT\u2010PCR for detection of enteropathogens is that the low viral numbers that can be detected may not be significant. However, this statement is not valid because in most field situations the time of onset of diarrhoea is not known or detected, so the peak of viral shedding may have already passed by the time of sampling. When using qRT\u2010PCR the pathogen loads can be quantified and high loads identified. In addition, the significance of identifying low viral numbers in an individual sample can be increased by sampling multiple animals.

The higher pathogen detection achieved in this study likely reflects the use of the qRT\u2010PCR assay, which has a lower limit of detection than antigen detection assays. The emphasis placed on collecting samples from calves early in the disease course may have also facilitated pathogen detection. In a recent review of diarrhoeic calf submissions to diagnostic laboratories in Australia, no pathogen was isolated from 25\u201352% of samples, and the higher failure to detect any pathogen was mainly because of incomplete diagnostic testing, with only 17.2% of samples (37/215) tested for all the major calf scour pathogens.\n52\n Such results highlight the misunderstandings and errors in diagnosis that often occur in the identification of enteropathogens in the field in the absence of laboratory investigation. Underutilisation of diagnostic laboratories likely reflects their policy of full cost recovery.",

Dairy beef operations grow and finish dairy/dairy\u2010cross steers and heifers for the domestic and export beef market. The dairy beef property is very different from a dairy farm, with calves coming from multiple sources, thus providing opportunities for a diversity of pathogens to be introduced. This situation was reflected by the significantly greater proportion of dairy beef samples from which multiple pathogens were isolated. The logistic regression performed to investigate the pathogen profile of dairy and dairy beef operations was limited to the age group that accounted for nearly 90% of the dairy beef sample submissions (i.e. 5\u201314 days), because the data for the other age groups was sparse and unbalanced. It would have been ideal to have more animals in the different age groups so that age and system could be evaluated in the same model. The age distribution of calves in dairy beef operations is inherently slightly different to dairy operations because of the restrictions in Australia on the transport of calves aged less than 4 days.",

Dairy bull calves are an unwanted byproduct of current dairy production systems, so are less likely to receive colostrum and thus passive transfer of immunity than the heifer calves that are retained as herd replacements. Co\u2010mingling of dairy beef calves during farm collection and transport also provides more opportunity for mixed pathogen exposure and stress may contribute to immunosuppression. Although rotavirus and Salmonella are prevalent on a significant number of farms, there are likely to be strain variations between farms. Thus, antibodies derived from maternal colostrum may only be specific for strains on a particular property. In order to maximise the number of animals that pass through dairy beef enterprises, there is a need for all available housing to be maximally stocked, which can lead to failure of appropriate disinfection between the removal of older calves and the introduction of young ones, resulting in enteric pathogens being passed between different groups of calves.",

Salmonella spp. and rotavirus were more likely to be isolated from diarrhoeic calves from dairy beef rather than dairy operations.
