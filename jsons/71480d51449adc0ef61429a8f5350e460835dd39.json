These patients were categorized as fibrinolysis shutdown based on the presence of elevated D-Dimer and low fibrinolytic activity; fibrinolysis shutdown has previously been described as LY30 of less than 0.8% but the more complete shutdown seen in these patients results in an LY30 of 0% as a diagnostic cutoff based on the Youden Index for maximizing sensitivity and specificity.

Defining the optimum predictive test for micro-or macro-thromboses requires further study, however the TEG in conjunction with the D-dimer appear to be a sensitive marker for severity of disease which will need to be studied in a prospective fashion. A TEG LY30 of 0% and a D-dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml together suggest complete fibrinolysis shutdown and markedly elevated risk of renal failure, VTE, and thrombotic events. The optimum medical therapy to address this hypercoagulable and fibrinolytic state is still unknown, however these results suggest the need to consider therapeutic anticoagulation and potentially tPA therapy to directly addresses the failure in the coagulation cascade of this high-risk group of patients.

Due to the higher performance with D-Dimer, this coagulation measurement was used to find the inflection point for need for dialysis. The Youden index was found to be 2600 ng/ml. An elevated D-Dimer above this threshold was appreciated in 34% of the study population. Variables contrasting patients with high D-Dimers versus lower are listed in table 4. An elevated D-Dimer was associated with a 73% new onset need for dialysis versus 17% for lower D-Dimer levels (p=0.001Figure 3). Need for dialysis occurred at a median of day 7 of hospitalization (IQR 4.5-9), with AKI occurring on day 3 (IQR 1-5), while VTE and thrombotic events did not occur until 12 (IQR 7-14.5) or 11.5 (IQR 9.5-21) days from hospital admission, respectively; all VTE or thrombotic events were noted after AKI or dialysis need had been established.

Elevated D-Dimer and low LY30 have previously been defined as fibrinolysis shutdown in trauma23 . This fibrinolytic phenotype has been associated with poor outcomes in trauma[24][25][26][27][28] . The cause of elevated D-Dimer levels in COVID-19 patients remains unclear but could be reflective of an excessive amount of intravascular polymerized fibrin. Fibrin acts as co-factor for its own destruction30 , therefore a high burden of fibrin will result in elevated D-Dimer levels with minimal systemic fibrinolytic activity. This occurs as there is more reagent that is more readily broken down due to an increase in binding opportunities for plasminogen activators and plasminogen to co-localize. Alternatively, it is possible that a high D-Dimer level could be representative of a viral activator of the fibrinolytic system with subsequent shutdown. Patients meeting this fibrinolysis shutdown laboratory definitions of low systemic fibrinolysis and elevated D-Dimers demonstrated marked drops in D-Dimer over 24-hour periods compared to the other patient cohorts that had mild increased in D-dimer during this time frame. This rise and fall of fibrinolytic activity has been demonstrated in animal models of endotoxin, in which plasminogen activation occurs within 2 hours of intravenous infusion but is followed by an abrupt inhibition of fibrinolysis29 . In a study evaluating the addition of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) to viscoelastic blood analysis of septic patients without evidence of DIC, even low doses of rTPA did not correct the hypofibrinolytic state31 .",

COVID-19 autopsies have clearly demonstrated diffuse micro thrombi including the kidney and lungs and are believed to be the cause of organ failure in this patient population10,13 . Microthrombi have been demonstrated in animal models of shock34 and these can be reversed with pre-treatment using heparin 35 or post-treatment with a fibrinolytic agent36 .Despite evidence of a DIC-type picture in lungs and kidneys supported by COVID-19 autopsy studies, platelet counts remain relatively normal and fibrinogen levels are elevated in these patients, suggesting that the conventional ISTH DIC score fails to capture the prothrombotic coagulopathy seen in this patient population. Surprisingly in our patient population of COVID-19 infected patients, marked D-dimer elevation and TEG LY30 levels of 0% were seen in patient samples drawn more than 2 weeks into their ICU course and the ISTH score for DIC remained low. These findings suggest the possibility of a prolonged imbalance between native tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1), a strong inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system. The use of fibrinolytic agents in phase I clinical trials to treat ARDS in critically ill patients have also demonstrated promising results in improving oxygenation37,38 . The use of fibrinolytics to treat ARDS in COVID-19 have been proposed39 , utilized as salvage therapy in New York City 40 , and projected to have a large impact on patient outcomes 41 , if efficacy is as promising as early use of fibrinolytic therapy to treat ARDS in prior Phase I trials.",

Specially designed \"Surge\" COVID-19 ICU teams in physically isolated cohort units had been established and staffed by a multidisciplinary pool of pulmonary critical care, anesthesia critical care, and surgical critical care attendings. Any patient admitted to one of these Surge ICU teams who had TEG testing was included in this analysis; the first TEG drawn was used for analysis in an attempt to identify hypercoagulability early in the patients' course, thereby providing a potential window for therapeutic intervention.IRB exemption was granted to this study by our institution (COMIRB Protocol 20-0947). Study data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Citrated Kaolin/Kaolin-heparinase TEG (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA) in vitro point of care testing was ordered at the discretion of the intensivist to guide clinical care and was more heavily used by the anesthesia and surgical critical care group who routinely use this tool intraoperatively and for critical care management of trauma and transplant patient populations. TEG indices recorded included r-time, angle, maximum amplitude (MA), and lysis at 30 minutes (LY30). Additional coagulation measurementsincluded a complete blood count for measurements of platelets, fibrinogen level, and D-Dimer. All coagulation assays were conducted by the clinical laboratory.

This patient cohort had a high rate of renal failure which preceded VTE diagnosis. An elevated D-Dimer was associated with the need for dialysis, while a low LY30 was associated with VTE. Nearly a quarter of these critically ill patients had an LY30 of 0% and D-Dimer >2600 ng/mL and 80% of these patients required dialysis, 50% had a VTE, and 30% had a thrombotic stroke. These results demonstrate that fibrinolysis shutdown correlates with thrombotic complications. Of note, this cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients was clearly hypercoagulable, despite high normal or frankly elevated PT and PTT levels, demonstrating the importance of using whole blood coagulation assays (which more closely approximate in vivo conditions including the presence of cells and platelets) such as the TEG for improved risk stratification. As a rapid test to demonstrate complete fibrinolysis shutdown, an LY30 of 0% in conjunction with D-Dimer levels over 2600 ng/ml may serve as a sensitive marker for the patients most at risk for VTE and other thrombotic complications.Critically ill patients in ICU settings experience VTE rates of 13-30% without chemoprophylaxis and 5-15% with routine chemoprophylaxis11 . An early series of 184 COVID-19 ICU status patients demonstrated a VTE rate of 27% and arterial thrombosis rate of 3.7% supporting a particular predisposition to hypercoagulation in this new patient population 12 .
