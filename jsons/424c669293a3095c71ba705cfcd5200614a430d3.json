[3] [4] [5] Given the immune diversity within the human population, a perfect model relevant to all humans may be neither an achievable nor a reasonable expectation. However, it is possible to strive for relevant and reproducible translational models and to expect experimental designs to address specific research questions. Criticisms of mouse models (mouse blaming) are not always justified. Many factors contribute to study outcomes and reproducibility. These include genetic diversity; microbial, husbandry, and other environmental factors; experimental interventions; etc. 2 Increasing the awareness of the immunobiological variations among inbred mice and their substrains as well as other factors that may impact immune responses in mice will help improve both the validity and reproducibility of mousebased research. Attention to these aspects is warranted in experimental design, data interpretations, and reporting of research on immunity, disease, and therapeutic interventions. 6, 7 This review aims to provide a useful compendium of resources and references for those investigators who seek to familiarize themselves with key concepts of mouse immunology and translate those notions into the experimental setting.

[8] [9] [10] Nomenclature \"rules\" for mice genes, strains, and substrains were recommended by scientists to the scientific community in the 1940s and 1950s. The first committees on standardized genetics nomenclature 11 and on standardized strain nomenclature for mice 12 included Nobel laureate George Snell. Early publications provided guidelines for gene and strain nomenclature, a list (database) of strains and substrains, and a list (database) of abbreviations for the researchers or institutions maintaining the mice. 12 The list of abbreviations became the \"laboratory codes\" (lab codes) that are currently curated by ILAR (http://dels.nas.edu/global/ilar/lab-codes) and are available to producers and researchers at no charge. The lab code identifies the mouse source and becomes part of its name. The 1963 revision includes a listing of named genes, including histocompatibility alleles for many of the common strains. Subsequent committees updated the guidelines and included lists of inbred strains, substrains, and known genetic variants. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] These publications are enlightening regarding the history and research use of contemporary mouse strains. They indicate recognition by the scientific community of the research implications of genetic and phenotypic variations, and reflect scientists' concerns for accurate communication in published research. In 1972, a recommendation was published for standardized nomenclature for outbred stocks of laboratory animals of various species. 20 These recommendations gained traction for mice and rats, but far less for other species. Current gene nomenclature \"rules\" for mice (International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice: http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/ strains.shtml), rats (Rat Gene Nomenclature Committee: https:// rgd.mcw.edu/nomen/nomen.shtml), and human genes (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee: http://www.genenames.org/) are available online. Guidance for mouse strains, genes, alleles/ mutations as well as tutorials and assistance can be accessed from Mouse Genome Informatics Nomenclature sites (http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml). Recommendations for reporting animal research include correct nomenclature because it communicates key research-relevant elements of the strain or substrain history and genetics, genetic modifications, backcrossing or intercrossing, and other information.

As illustrated in Table 2 , some immune relevant genetic variations among C57BL/6 substrains include a Nlrp12 mutation in C57BL/6J mice and a Dock2 mutation in C57BL/6NHsd mice from certain colonies. 55, 77 The Nlrp12 gene primarily controls neutrophil chemotaxis in response to bacterial invasion. C57BL/6J mice carry a missense, loss of function mutation (Nlrp12 C57BL/6J ) and are more susceptible to certain bacterial infections compared with other C57BL/6 substrains harboring the wild-type Nlrp12 allele. 55,73 More concerning may be when mutations arise within a substrain (of the same name) with colonies maintained at different sites. The Dock2 Hsd mutation was revealed when reduced splenic marginal zone B cells and increased numbers of CD8+ T cells were identified in C57BL/6NHsd (and derived mutant mice) relative to other C57BL/6N mice. 77 -79 Subsequently, Envigo tested their mice and reported that this mutation (Dock2 Hsd ) was present in 6 of their 19 C57BL/6NHsd colonies (http://www.envigo.com/ assets/docs/c57-customer-communication-2-final-9jun16.pdf).

The proclivity to develop experimentally induced autoimmune conditions, such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), is also greatly influenced by the mouse's genetic background. 31, [96] [97] [98] [99] The NOD mouse model for Type 1 diabetes (T1D) (e.g., NOD/ShiLtJ and NOD/ MrkTac mice) is characterized by the development of a T cellmediated immune response to pancreatic islet proteins (including insulin and chromogranin) similar to humans with T1D. [100] [101] [102] Their diabetic phenotype is polygenic with a significant contribution, as in humans, by their MHC polymorphisms. 44,103-105 NOD mice have a unique MHC class II lacking expression of I-E\u03b1 and I-E surface protein, and expressing I-A g7 MHC class II allele that is structurally and functionally similar to the human T1D susceptibility allele, DQ8. 106, 107 Other contributors to the autoimmune phenotype include a hypoactive variant of their IL-2 gene (Il2 m1 ), Sirpa and Cd93 polymorphisms, lack of C5 (conferred by homozygosity for Hc 0 ), and absence of complement factor H-related protein C (CFHR-C). 43, 44, 105, [108] [109] [110] Genetic and phenotypic variations among the NOD substrains have been identified. 111 Spontaneous lupus-like conditions in mice are associated with mutations such as Fas lpr and Yaa and are influenced by genetic background. 28-36 Inbred strains that spontaneously develop lupus-like conditions include MRL/MpJ, BXSB/MpJ, NZB, NZW, NZBWF1 (aka NZB/W), NZM2410, and Palmerston North (PN/nBSwUmabJ). 112, 63, 113, 114 MRL/MpJ inbred mice are autoimmune prone and spontaneously develop an autoimmune phenotype as they age. A spontaneous mutation in the Fas lpr gene in this strain resulted in the substrain MRL/MpJ-Fas lpr , which develops signs of autoimmunity much earlier in life than the parent MRL/MpJ strain. [115] [116] [117] [118] MRL/ MpJ-Fas lpr mice have a short lifespan (>50% mortality by 6 months old). They develop lymphoproliferative disease, immune complex glomerulonephritis, lupus-like skin disease, arthritis, and vasculitis. 115, [120] [121] [122] [123] It has been demonstrated that onset and severity of symptoms associated with the Fas lpr mutation is strain dependent. For example, the Fas lpr mutation results in a lymphoproliferative disease that on MRL/MpJ background is more severe than on the C57BL/6J background, but less severe than on the C3H/HeJ background. 28, 29, 31, 124 In contrast, immune complex pathologies including glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and arthritis are more severe and initiate earlier with the Fas lpr Adapted/updated from https://www.envigo.com/resources/data-sheets/envigo-68-c57bl6-enhanced-technical-data-sheet_screen.pdf Dock2 = the protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.

[28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] Interestingly, when compared with C57BL/6J and/ or C3H/HeJ mice, the MRL/MpJ strain harbors diverse polymorphic alleles, unique QTL, or specific haplotypes that render this background more susceptible to autoimmune manifestations. 28-32 As an example, low to no expression of CFHR-C in MRL/MpJ may contribute to the immune hyperresponsiveness typical of this strain. 109 BXSB/Mp mice are a recombinant inbred (RI) strain originating from a cross between a C57BL/6J female and a SB/Le male, also developed by Murphy 125, 126 in his work on autoimmune conditions (lab code Mp). They develop a lupus-like disorder that is accelerated in males and is attributed primarily to the Y-associated autoimmune accelerator locus (Yaa) of the SB/ Le male founder. Yaa is a 4-mb translocated region from the X chromosome that includes multiple genes, among which Tlr7 seems to be the major contributor to the phenotype. [127] [128] [129] NZB mice develop a variety of autoimmune phenotypes characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia with elevated circulating autoantibodies (including anti-DNA antibodies and anti-thymocyte antibodies), Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, and immune complex glomerulonephritis. NZB mice also manifest a lymphoproliferative disorder involving the B1 subset of B cells. This condition progresses to lymphoma/leukemia, with similarities to human familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia. [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] NZW mice develop autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis, with a female predisposition. 135 F1 hybrid offspring of NZB females and NZW males (also referred to as NZB/W) develop a life-limiting autoimmune condition characterized by high levels of antinuclear antibodies, hemolytic anemia, proteinuria, and progressive immune complex glomerulonephritis that is more severe in females. [136] [137] [138] NZB/W autoimmune phenotypes map to multiple susceptibility loci, including Sle, Lbw, and Wbw loci and polymorphisms in Tnf, Nkt2, and Cd93, and are linked to a low to no expression of CFHR-C. 110, 111, 139 NZM2410 mice (New Zealand Mixed strain 2410, e.g., NZM2410/J https://www.jax.org/strain/002676) derive from NZB/ W backcrossed to NZW mice then selected for lupus-like nephritis deaths and inbred. They bear the NZW histocompatibility haplotype H2 z (K u , A u , S z , D z ). Males as well as females develop autoimmune glomerulonephritis at an early age, and this strain has been especially useful in mapping lupus susceptibility loci. 138, [140] [141] [142] ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 402, "end": 406, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 407, "end": 411, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 412, "end": 416, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 417, "end": 421, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 422, "end": 426, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 427, "end": 431, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 432, "end": 436, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 442, "end": 446, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 814, "end": 817, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 955, "end": 966, "text": "Murphy 125,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 967, "end": 970, "text": "126", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1358, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1364, "text": "[128]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1370, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1849, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1855, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1861, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1862, "end": 1867, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1873, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2260, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2266, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2272, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2469, "text": "110,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2474, "text": "111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2475, "end": 2478, "text": "139", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2915, "end": 2919, "text": "138,", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2920, "end": 2925, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2926, "end": 2931, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2932, "end": 2937, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influence of Genetic Background"}, {"text": "Supplementary Table 2 gives a comprehensive overview for most of the well-known murine immune relevant mutations that exhibit Mendelian inheritance. Historically, identification of the genetic basis for spontaneous Mendelian (monogenic) phenotypes was attained via forward genetics approaches to confirm that the heritable trait (phenotype) maps to a specific locus. Additional molecular investigations, including sequencing, are applied to define the mutation further. 88, 143 An advantage of forward genetics is the relatively unbiased approach that requires no assumptions or hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of the trait or phenotype. An historical and illustrative example in immunology is the characterization of TLR4, first recognized as the main sensor for lipopolysaccharides (LPS) thanks to studies conducted on the spontaneously TLR4 deficient C3H/HeJ mice, and closely related TLR4 sufficient substrains. 95 A null mutation Tlr4 lps-del mapping to the same site was identified later in the C57BL/10ScCr substrain of the C57BL/10 mouse and is now available as C57BL/ 10ScNJ. 144, 68 Similarly, the role of Foxp3 as an essential transcription factor for the development of regulatory T cell (Tregs) was first revealed via the analysis of mice with the spontaneous scurfy mutation (Foxp3 sf ). 145 Hereditary immune deficiencies related to spontaneous recessive scid, Lyst bg (bg or beige), and Btk xid (xid) mutations have been valuable in the study of orthologous conditions in humans and other animals. 146 The scid and nu (nude) mutations have been especially important for their utility in studying engrafted human tissues in the context of xenotrasplantation experiments. 147 Hereditary hyperimmune or autommune conditions related to spontaneous recessive Fas lpr (lpr, lymphoproliferation) and Fasl gld (gld, generalized lymphoproliferative disease) mutations in an important cell death pathway have also been informative. Mice homozygous for either mutation develop lymphoproliferative and autoimmune phenotypes. The (recessive) lpr mutation at the Fas locus compromises the FAS-mediated apoptosis pathway. 115, 123, 148, 149 The (recessive) gld point mutation is in the Fas ligand (Fasl) locus, and homozygosity for this mutation also compromises FAS-mediated apoptosis. The gld mutation arose spontaneously in C3H/HeJ mice, resulting in the C3H/HeJ-Fasl gld substrain. 150, 151 Interactions Among Mutations Table 3 summarizes genetic and phenotypic characteristics of some of the widely used mice that carry multiple spontaneous immune relevant mutations. Before the advent of modern genetic engineering capabilities, interbreeding to combine multiple hereditary disorders was used to study phenotypic manifestations of gene interactions and to overcome limitations of the single mutation models, particularly in mice used for xenotransplantation experiments. 89 As an example, scid-beige mice homozygous for both the Prkdc scid and Lyst bg alleles were generated to combine the impaired B and T cell development of the Prkdc scid mouse with the defective NK cell function associated with the Lyst bg mutation. These mice are not only severely immunodeficient, but they also lack the \"leaky\" phenotype of the Prkdc scid animals. The cooperation between the 2 mutations remarkably improves xenotransplantation compared with the single mutation in the Prkdc scid mouse. 152, 153 Combinations of multiple mutations have proved useful in understanding the epistatic interactions among immune relevant genes. Double-mutant mice homozygous for both Fas lpr and the Foxn1 nu are an example. The congenital T cell deficiency that characterizes the Foxn1 nu mutation is sufficient to abolish the autoimmune and lymphoproliferative phenotype associated with the Fas lpr allele. This finding was consistent with the significant abrogation of the phenotype achieved by neonatal thymectomy in MRL/MpJ-Fas lpr /J mice, and provided early support for the hypotheses regarding the T cell dependence of the Fas lpr -associated autoimmune and lymphoproliferative condition. 89, [154] [155] [156] [157] Other important immunodeficient models featuring combinations of spontaneous and induced mutations along with specific strain-related immune variations are further discussed in a companion article by Simons and colleagues in the present issue of the ILAR Journal and include the well-known NSG and NOG mice.

In addition to considering strain sensitivity when determining radiation dosage, calibration of the irradiator is also important, as there is considerable decay over time and actual dosage may differ between studies or between irradiators. Immune-suppressive effects of high-dose \u03b3-irradiation are well known. 182 High-dose \u03b3-irradiation differentially affects the diverse populations of mouse lymphocytes with B cells recognized as more radiosensitive than T cells. 183 Repeated low-dose gamma irradiation also has profound immunomodulatory effects and is linked to a robust Th2 skewing that may mitigate autoimmune conditions that are dependent on a Th1 response. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, reduced CD8+ CTLs, and up-regulation of Tregs also have been demonstrated in certain experimental conditions, including CIA and EAE. 184 Overwhelming infections remain an important cause of mortality of irradiated experimental animals and clinical patients. Mice with defective adaptive immunity including nude, scid and NOD scid mice can effectively control common opportunistic agents such as Pseudomonads, until myeloablative effects of irradiation or other interventions eliminate their innate immunity as well. 185 Effects of ionizing radiation on other tissues, and on developing or proliferating cells, influence morbidity and mortality of research mice. Radiation impact on developing brain, bone, eyes and teeth as well as on heart, lung, kidney, may complicate interpretation of disease or death related to rejection, GVHD, or other research endpoints. [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] Ultraviolet (UV) radiation effects on local skin immunity are especially relevant to research on photocarcinogenesis or inflammatory skin conditions. [196] [197] [198] Effects vary with dose, duration of exposure and wavelength composition. [196] [197] [198] UV radiation primarily affects adaptive immunity, and has been used to induce and promote skin photocarcinogenesis, and to modulate the immune response in diverse experimental immunoinflammatory conditions of the skin. [196] [197] [198] Chemicals Experimental use of chemicals also has been and remains an important method to suppress or ablate immunity. Examples including metals, aromatic hydrocarbons and other environmental contaminants, and antimicrobial agents are summarized in Table 4 . Alkylating agents that affect chromosomal DNA through formation of phosphodiesters and DNA-DNA crosslinks, are widely used. Cyclophosphamide (CYP), a cytotoxic alkylating agent used in the treatment of neoplastic and autoimmune diseases, is also exploited to induce neutropenia in the context of infectious disease studies. 199 Mice with impaired granulocyte production and/or leukocyte function secondary to CYP are more prone to develop systemic disease upon experimental infection with environmental opportunists such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Cryptococcus neoformans. 200, 201 CYP has both immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects. 202 Immunosuppression in mice appears to result from the induction of apoptosis in activated B and T cells as well as NK cells. 203 At low doses, CYP may enhance immune responses to tumor antigens attributed, at least in part, to suppression of Tregs. 204 Similarly, the alkylating agent busulfan is used as conditioning regimen to enhance engraftment of xenotrasplanted hematopoietic stem cells. 205, 206 Other important agents include 5-fluorouracil (5FU), which selectively depletes tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promoting the activation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. 207, 208 Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine A, directly inhibit Tregs function, by inhibiting pheripheral Tregs generation, and less directly by limiting IL2 production, in preventing transplant rejection and to treat a variety of autoimmune conditions. [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] Glucocorticoids are important clinically and experimentally for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. 216 A variety of experimental interventions including hormones, antimicrobials, nanoparticles, etc., have immunomodulatory effects that may not be intended or expected, especially by investigators who are new to using them in mice. For example, estrogens (and synthetic estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol) and androgens have immunosuppressive effects that affect both adaptive and innate immunity. [217] [218] [219] [220] Nanoparticles, usually studied as a drug delivery method or biomedical imaging tool (e.g., metallic nanoparticles), are typically taken up by macrophage/monocyte cells and may act either as immunostimulants or as immunosuppressants and may have additional immune effects related to imaging methods such as MRI or \u03bcCT. 221 The unique physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles influence their interactions with host's immune system and determine the overall immunotoxicologic profile. 222, 223 Biologics Biologics with immune modulating properties have been

immunosuppressive agent that specifically depletes T cells from peripheral blood and lymphoid organs in NOD mice; it is also used in the modulation of graft rejection and autoimmune disorders in mice. 227, 228 Glucans, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) and bacterial enterotoxins have been used as prophylactic or therapeutic interventions to modify immune responses to infections or vaccination, or to counteract effects of immunotoxic agents (see Table 4 ). 229, 230 Surgical Thymectomy or splenectomy are the traditional surgical methods to alter immunity. Thymectomy in neonatal or adult animals has profound effects on T cell development and continues to be an important procedure in studies of T cell ontogeny, tolerance and education. Neonatal thymectomy experiments offered early evidence of the existence of Tregs as these mice develop autoimmune disease shortly after the removal of thymus. 231 Thymectomy is also used to investigate the dynamics of extrathymic T cell development. 232 However, mice exhibit a relatively high frequency of functional thymic tissue in ectopic locations, especially in close proximity to the thyroid gland (also known as cervical thymus).

BALB/ c (H-2 d ) mice are not so susceptible to CIA but are highly susceptible to PGIA. 96, 297, 299 In contrast, DBA/2 (H-2 d ) are resistant to arthritis induction by either method, implicating roles for strain associated modifier genes. 299, 300 Non-MHC QTL associated with susceptibility to CIA and/or PGIA localize to regions on mouse chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 15, and 19 that contain multiple candidate genes with known immune functions. 299 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 392, "text": "96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 393, "end": 397, "text": "297,", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 398, "end": 401, "text": "298", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 596, "end": 599, "text": "96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 600, "end": 604, "text": "298,", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 605, "end": 608, "text": "299", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 845, "end": 849, "text": "297,", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 850, "end": 853, "text": "299", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}, {"start": 993, "end": 997, "text": "299,", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1001, "text": "300", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1195, "text": "299", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Rheumatoid Arthritis"}, {"text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder with a spectrum of disease manifestations. While disease is associated with certain genetic polymorphisms, environmental triggers as well as sex hormones have roles in disease development. 290, 301 A spontaneous mouse model of MS has not been identified. But various aspects of MS are recapitulated by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), classically induced \"actively\" by immunization with immunodominant myelin epitope components in combination with immunostimulants, or induced \"passively\" by adoptive transfer of preactivated myelin-specific T cells into na\u00efve mice. 98, [302] [303] [304] [305] EAE in mice was first reported in 1975, and the SJL/J and C3H/ HeJ strains were identified as susceptible strains. 98, 294, [302] [303] [304] 306 SJL/J mice are used to model features of relapsing-remitting MS, and their susceptibility is associated with several polymorphisms, including hyper-responsive IL12 and hypo-active IL2 and IL4. 67,306,307 Additionally, C57BL/6, DBA1, and C3H/HeJ strains also are sensitive to induction of EAE. 98, 294, 308 GEM models such as transgenic mice bearing human TCR and T cells targeting myelin-specific antigens (e.g., myelin basic protein) have been informative, 309 as has immune-mediated demyelination associated with infections by Theiler's Mouse Encephalitis Virus, a Picornavirus, in susceptible SJL/J and resistant C57BL/6. [310] [311] [312] Demyelination with certain strains of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a coronavirus, has been used to model features of MS in susceptible C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. This is primarily a virus-mediated cytolytic phenomenon, and SJL/J resistance is attributed to their spontaneous mutation in Ceacam1, whose protein product is an important receptor for neurovirulent MHV strains. [313] [314] [315] Other Immunomodulators and Unintended Experimental Consequences Table 5 summarizes examples of immune effects of common environmental factors including husbandry conditions, microbiota, as well as effects caused by experimental or therapeutic interventions. These examples illustrate why reporting of environmental and husbandry conditions and specifics of experimental or therapeutic interventions is warranted in scientific publications. Microenvironment refers to the immediate physical environment surrounding the animal such as the cage, pen, or stall. Macroenvironment refers to the physical environment of the secondary enclosure (e.g., a room, a barn, or an outdoor habitat). 323 A multitude of factors in the microenvironment and macroenvironment can be stressors. Stressors activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, in turn increasing circulating glucocorticoids. In mice, corticosterone is the primary stress-induced glucocorticoid. Corticosterone elevations (and corticosterone-mediated lymphocytolysis) are expected with stressors such as adverse environmental conditions, shipping, handling, social stresses, noise, vibration, etc. [317] [318] [319] Responses to stressors also vary with mouse strains. 320, 321 Caging Common contemporary caging options are open top, static microsiolators (filter top cages), and individually ventilated caging. Suspended wire caging is less common today but may be scientifically justified to prevent coprophagy and ingestion of drugs or metabolites in feces. Individually ventilated caging is increasingly available with advantages in terms of barrier protection of the animals, lower bioburden, and cage changing frequency and with concerns in terms of microenvironment temperature, humidity, wind, and dust. Temperature, vibration, Bedding Experimentally relevant parameters influenced by the type of bedding: higher intracage ammonia levels with reclaimed wood pulp bedding; corncob bedding associated with decreased efficiency of feed conversion in mice fed a high-fat diet; hepatotoxicity associated with vermiculite and unbleached pulp from pine and eucalyptus; hepatic and mammary carcinogenesis associated with aromatic red cedar bedding; altered estrogen signaling mainly due to BPA residues; corncob bedding associated with increased aggressivity and social stress in females; drastically lower endotoxin levels and bioburden associated with paper bedding. 323, 342, [352] [353] [354] [355] [356] [357] 366 Single or group housing and social stressors", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 259, "text": "290,", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 260, "end": 263, "text": "301", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}, {"start": 649, "end": 652, "text": "98,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 653, "end": 658, "text": "[302]", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 659, "end": 664, "text": "[303]", "ref_id": "BIBREF244"}, {"start": 665, "end": 670, "text": "[304]", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}, {"start": 671, "end": 676, "text": "[305]", "ref_id": "BIBREF246"}, {"start": 792, "end": 795, "text": "98,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 796, "end": 800, "text": "294,", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 801, "end": 806, "text": "[302]", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 807, "end": 812, "text": "[303]", "ref_id": "BIBREF244"}, {"start": 813, "end": 818, "text": "[304]", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}, {"start": 819, "end": 822, "text": "306", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1119, "text": "98,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1124, "text": "294,", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1128, "text": "308", "ref_id": "BIBREF249"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1284, "text": "309", "ref_id": "BIBREF250"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1453, "text": "[310]", "ref_id": "BIBREF251"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1459, "text": "[311]", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1465, "text": "[312]", "ref_id": "BIBREF253"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1843, "text": "[313]", "ref_id": "BIBREF254"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1849, "text": "[314]", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1855, "text": "[315]", "ref_id": "BIBREF257"}, {"start": 2540, "end": 2543, "text": "323", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 3010, "end": 3015, "text": "[317]", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 3016, "end": 3021, "text": "[318]", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}, {"start": 3022, "end": 3027, "text": "[319]", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 3081, "end": 3085, "text": "320,", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 3086, "end": 3089, "text": "321", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 4281, "end": 4285, "text": "323,", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 4286, "end": 4290, "text": "342,", "ref_id": "BIBREF285"}, {"start": 4291, "end": 4296, "text": "[352]", "ref_id": "BIBREF295"}, {"start": 4297, "end": 4302, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF296"}, {"start": 4303, "end": 4308, "text": "[354]", "ref_id": "BIBREF297"}, {"start": 4309, "end": 4314, "text": "[355]", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 4315, "end": 4320, "text": "[356]", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 4321, "end": 4326, "text": "[357]", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 4327, "end": 4330, "text": "366", "ref_id": "BIBREF310"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1920, "end": 1927, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Multiple Sclerosis"}, {"text": "Group housing: negative social events associated with lower lymphocyte proliferation; lower level of antigen-specific IgG; granulocytosis; lymphopenia, higher predisposition to tumor development and progression, huddling associated with amelioration of cold stress.

Huddling and nest building are methods of behavioral thermoregulation used by mice under cold stress. Recommended relative humidity is 55% \u00b1 10%. Humidity levels vary with type of caging, season, and geographic location. Higher humidity is associated with increased levels of ammonia and bioburden with severe impairment of respiratory mucosal immune response and increased risk of opportunistic infections, respectively. 327, 328, [337] [338] [339] [340] [341] [342] Illumination (Light) Circadian and light effects on immunity are recognized in many species, including humans and mice. Albino animals have higher light sensitivity, and a number of common mouse strains are blind with retinal degeneration but still exhibit responses to light and light cycles. [343] [344] [345] Dysregulation of circadian rhythmicity in mice induces a generalized proinflammatory macrophage activation and exacerbates diet-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. A balanced circadian rhythm is also critical to maintain immune homeostasis via the immunoregulatory activity of the neurohormone melatonin. 346, 347 Noise vibration While a number of common mouse strains are deaf or become deaf with age, hearing mice perceive and respond to sounds outside of human ranges. Noise and vibration are shown to cause stress, induce corticosterone, and negatively affect reproduction. [348] [349] [350] [351] Bedding While contemporary commercial contact bedding materials tend to be far more standardized with more quality control and freedom from contaminants than previously, contaminants with potential effects on research outcomes can still occur in bedding material. Dust, ammonia levels, fungal spores, phytoestrogens, and endotoxins in bedding also have implications for diverse research. Regional variation among bedding material has implications for various research areas, including immunology, with corncob bedding more available in the United States than in the European Union and other sites, and with hardwoods, cellulose, or paper being other common options. The relative palatability of or preference for a bedding over the intended diet may affect consumption of the diet. 323, [352] [353] [354] [355] [356] [357] Diet Contemporary commercial research diets also are far more standardized with more quality control than previously, and nutritional deficiencies are unlikely on contemporary commercial diets. Nutritional requirements for mice, including adequate levels of nutrients, 358 minerals, 359 and vitamins, 360 exist as do guidelines for contaminants in laboratory rodent diets. 361, 362 Possible contaminants with immunomodulatory effects include industrial chemicals (e.g., PCBs, PCDDs, and PCDFs), pesticides (e.g., DDT), metals, nitrosamines, endocrinedisrupting compounds, and mycotoxins. However, contaminants are identified in contemporary diets and are a concern for biomedical research and regulatory toxicology. 363, 364 Endocrine-disrupting phytoestrogen-rich ingredients, especially soy and alfalfa, as primary protein sources are expected in natural ingredient (aka grain-based or cereal-based) diets.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 39, "end": 43, "text": "458,", "ref_id": "BIBREF406"}, {"start": 44, "end": 47, "text": "459", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}, {"start": 189, "end": 192, "text": "464", "ref_id": "BIBREF412"}, {"start": 620, "end": 623, "text": "465", "ref_id": "BIBREF413"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1204, "text": "327,", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1209, "text": "328,", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1215, "text": "[337]", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1221, "text": "[338]", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1227, "text": "[339]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1233, "text": "[340]", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1239, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": "BIBREF284"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1245, "text": "[342]", "ref_id": "BIBREF285"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1545, "text": "[343]", "ref_id": "BIBREF286"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1551, "text": "[344]", "ref_id": "BIBREF287"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1557, "text": "[345]", "ref_id": "BIBREF288"}, {"start": 1888, "end": 1892, "text": "346,", "ref_id": "BIBREF289"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1896, "text": "347", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2166, "text": "[348]", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2172, "text": "[349]", "ref_id": "BIBREF292"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2178, "text": "[350]", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2184, "text": "[351]", "ref_id": "BIBREF294"}, {"start": 2967, "end": 2971, "text": "323,", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 2972, "end": 2977, "text": "[352]", "ref_id": "BIBREF295"}, {"start": 2978, "end": 2983, "text": "[353]", "ref_id": "BIBREF296"}, {"start": 2984, "end": 2989, "text": "[354]", "ref_id": "BIBREF297"}, {"start": 2990, "end": 2995, "text": "[355]", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 2996, "end": 3001, "text": "[356]", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 3002, "end": 3007, "text": "[357]", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 3291, "end": 3294, "text": "359", "ref_id": "BIBREF302"}, {"start": 3381, "end": 3385, "text": "361,", "ref_id": "BIBREF305"}, {"start": 3386, "end": 3389, "text": "362", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 3724, "end": 3728, "text": "363,", "ref_id": "BIBREF307"}, {"start": 3729, "end": 3732, "text": "364", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CRISPR-Cas9"}, {"text": "Phytoestrogens are recognized to have influences on rodent reproduction, immunity, cardiovascular, neoplastic, and other conditions. 365, 366 Animal byproducts, bone meal, and fish meal are used in many natural ingredient diets and are a source of nitrites and nitrosamines. 363, 367 Poor reporting of research-relevant diet factors such as differences between purified and natural ingredient diets have attracted attention and concern recently. 10,358,368 Research diets are frequently provided ad libitum to rodents on shorter term studies.

Such agents may be harbored by clinically \"healthy\" immune sufficient mice, or possibly by human handlers, and may be transferred by common equipment and other fomites. Proximity to immune sufficient mice or to any mouse cohort with different microbial status warrants special procedures and policies for sanitation and sterilization of caging, feed, water and other materials, sequence of animal handling, and microbial surveillance. GEM models may also manifest unexpected immunodeficiencies. 375 Immunomodulatory effects by common agents (Table 5 ) demand that immune relevant research must pay greater attention to microbial exclusion lists and definition of the specific pathogen free (SPF) status in the vivarium as well as in reporting. Use of the term SPF requires specification of the excluded agents. 316, [376] [377] [378] Some of the most concerning opportunistic agents in contemporary immunodeficient mice, such as Staphylococcus xylosus, Corynebacterium bovis, and Pneumocystis murina, are fairly common and usually subclinical in immune sufficient mice.

As an example, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) have been identified as an important antigenic stimulus in inducing Th17 responses, and murine Th17 responses are blunted in mice that lack SFB. 395 Also SFB are shown to influence neuroinflammation in EAE models, diabetes susceptibility in NOD mice, and development of autoimmune arthritis in some models. [387] [388] [389] [390] SFB normally colonize the distal small intestine of infant mice and decline with the maturation of the mucosal barrier and local IgA levels. 391 In mice with deficient adaptive immunity or Ig production, or mice specifically deficient in IgA, SFB persist with expanded distribution throughout the small intestine. 392, 393 SFB are difficult to propagate in vitro and have not been included in the standardized communities of intestinal microbiota (e.g., Altered Schaedler flora) specifically maintained in some sources of laboratory mice to uniform the influence of microbiota on the experimental conditions. In this context, SFB are not expected in immune deficient mice from certain commercial vendors that maintain the mice in isolators with defined or highly restricted flora. 394, 395 Strain-associated and vendor-dependent differences in the gut microflora of laboratory mice have been identified and are implicated in variability in research results (see Table 5 ). 378, 385, [396] [397] [398] [399] [400] Flora with more Bacteroides spp. and Parabacteroides spp. such as Parabacteroides distasonis may mitigate DSS-induced colitis. 401 Mice of similar strains but from sources with more simplified or restricted microbiota, lacking SFB, have quite different dendritic cell profiles and Th17 responses. 402 In several immune relevant GEM including IL10, T cell receptor alpha, and IL2 knockout mice, intestinal inflammation also is substantially influenced by intestinal microbiome. 403, 404 Enteric protists are common in mice (but usually excluded from commercial sources) and also have been shown to influence Th17 and Th1 responses as well. 405, 406 The microbiota or autochthonous microflora of research animals are increasingly recognized as highly research relevant. The restricted microflora of na\u00efve mice from reputable commercial sources have been presented as a research concern, but their well-characterized microbiota also represent an opportunity for this area of immune relevant research. [407] [408] Allochthonous (noncommensal) agents Morbidity, mortality, and other adverse or confounding effects of infectious agents on research have led to great effort and expense toward microbial definition and exclusion by commercial sources of mice and for quarantine and surveillance by research programs to protect animals and research from infections. 410 Immune deficient mice are notoriously susceptible to disease and death from pathogens and opportunists. The same agents in immune sufficient mice may result in subclinical infections or a spectrum of disease phenotypes that are influenced by genetic background, age, sex, and other factors. But any agent detected by an immune system can be expected to elicit an immune response, or \"immunomodulate.\" Table 5 summarizes examples of microbial effects on immunity and particular concerns for morbidity and mortality in immune deficient mice. 411, 412 Viruses with selective tropisms for immune cells include some of the murine parvoviruses, herpesviruses, and retroviruses. Many of the parvoviruses infecting mice are lymphocytotropic, altering both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated responses during acute infection. 378, 413, 414 Although long-term immune effects may not be identified with natural infections by some parvoviruses, significant immunomodulation is well documented with infection by others (Table 5 ). 378 Parvoviruses replicate in actively dividing cells and are studied as oncolytic agents in combined anti-cancer therapies. 415 Several mouse parvoviruses were identified originally as contaminants in biological materials such as tumor cell lines. They remain among the most common agents identified in research mice, pet store and feral mice, and biological materials. Despite the usual absence of clinical signs in parovirus-infected mice, these agents should be especially concerning in immune relevant and cancer studies. 409, [416] [417] [418] [419] [420] Although mouse herpesviruses are not expected in contemporary research colonies, mice are host to several lymphocytotropic herpesviruses that are reported in pet store and feral mice. 421, 422 Mouse thymic virus infection in newborn mice causes thymic necrosis, with selective targeting of T cells, and transient immunosuppression. 413 This agent or a close relative was recently classified under the genus Roseolovirus similar to human roseoloviruses. 423, 424 Murine cytomegalovirus is used to model human cytomegalovirus infection and targets hematolymphoid tissues and salivary glands. Disease manifestations vary with the genetic background. 425 Occult (seronegative) murine cytomegalovirus infection has been shown to affect responses to allografts. 426 Murine gammaherpesvirus 68, a natural pathogen of bank voles, is related to human gamma herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and is used to study the pathogenesis of gammaherpesviruses in experimentally infected mice. However, Mus musculus ssp. are not the natural host, and horizontal transmission between laboratory mice is not expected. 422, [426] [427] [428] [429] [430] EBV is a human Blymphotropic gamma herpesvirus that infects more than 90% of the human population. Human infections are subclinical (latent) when effectively controlled or can result in infectious mononucleosis or malignancies such as Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Immunodeficient and humanized mice have been informative preclinical tools for studying the pathogenesis of some of the conditions associated with EBV. [431] [432] [433] EBV-induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders are also increasingly recognized to complicate research with human patient derived xenografts in severely immunodeficient mice [434] [435] [436] and may be amenable to suppression of human lymphocyte proliferation in the donor tissue. 437, 438 Exogenous retroviruses and active endogenous retroviruses have lymphocyte tropisms and roles in immune modulation and lymphoproliferative conditions as well as in mammary carcinogenesis, sarcoma development, and lymphomagenesis. Exogenous horizontally transmitted retroviruses have been eliminated from commercially available mice but are identified in wild mice. Insertional mutagenesis with reintegration of endogenous retroviruses or transposition of retroelements has resulted in spontaneous mutations including some immune relevant ones such as Foxn1 nu , Lep ob , and Fas lpr . [439] [440] [441] Mice infected with LP-BM5 (defective) murine leukemia virus develop murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and have been widely used as a preclinical model to study the pathogenesis of human retroviral infections (Table 5) . 442, 443 Lifelong expression of viral proteins encoded by endogenous retroviruses/retroelements may be responsible for most of the spontaneous immune-mediated conditions observed in some inbred strains during aging, including glomerulonephritis and polyarteritis. 440, 444 Strain-specific variations in the composition and activity of endogenous retroviruses/retroelements and immune response against retroviral antigens also play a role in the susceptibility of specific mouse backgrounds to experimental autoimmune conditions including SLE and T1D. [445] [446] [447] [448] While the parvoviruses, herpesviruses, and exogenous retroviruses have been eliminated from commercial sources of contemporary laboratory mice because of disease or other confounding effects on research, recent interest in the \"normal\" immunity of wild or pet store mice may render these agents, as well as historically important mouse disease problems and zoonotic concerns, more relevant. 449, 450 Biological Materials Biological materials, including transplantable tumors, cell lines, serum, embryos, and gametes, can harbor a diversity of mouse viruses (parvoviruses, ectromelia virus, MHV, lactose dehydrogenase elevating virus, and retroviruses), human viruses, and bacteria, notoriously the Mycoplasmas. 420, 451, 452 They therefore represent a substantial concern as a source of pathogens and microbial confounders, especially in studies that involve immunodeficient rodents. Reporting recommendations plead for QA of cell lines: genetic QA (authentication to confirm the identity of the cell lines), and microbial QA (to assure freedom from pathogens).

(tissue-specific) gene targeting. The endonuclease activity of Cre recombinase, including the \"illegitimate\" targeting of the numerous pseudo-loxP sites across the mouse genome, results in the strong induction of an antiviral response. This is due to the recruitment of the specific cytosolic DNA sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), concurrent with Cre-dependent DNA damage and the accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA fragments. Given the primary role of STING in the activation of antiviral immune pathways (including type-I IFN), Cre expression can impact multiple immune parameters in Cre/loxP-based mouse models. Appropriate Cre-only controls may help in distinguishing signal from noise. 457 The tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP system (Cre-ERT2) allows site-and time-specific gene targeting in the mouse. Tamoxifen has immune relevant effects, as well as toxic and genotoxic effects. The estrogen-dependent and -independent effects of tamoxifen have been demonstrated to promote a shift from a Th1-to a Th2-mediated immune responses. Such effects can especially impact allergy and autoimmune models involving activation of Th1-mediated immunity (e.g., EAE and some SLE models). 458, 459 Recently, oral ivermectin treatment has been specifically linked to the unintended activation of Cre-ERT2 system in T cells. 460 Tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation (Tet-Off/Tet-On) systems allow site-specific, reversible, and dosedependent control of gene expression in mice. Doxycycline (a tetracycline derivative) is administered or withdrawn to regulate target gene expression. Doxycycline in mice interferes with and modulates immune and inflammatory responses relevant to allotransplant rejection, response to LPS, and neutrophil chemotaxis, among others. [461] [462] [463] Recent works have also unveiled the effect of doxycycline on murine gut microbiota and how the resulting dysbiosis might affect the immune response in diverse experimental settings. [461] [462] [463] DNA binding by tetracycline/doxycycline-controlled Tettransactivator (tTA) and its reverse is apparently sufficient to induce apoptosis in activated lymphocytes. These findings indicate that a major experimental bias exists in the use of the Tet-On/Off system for lymphocyte targeting as the approach may (1) limit the extent of the adaptive immune reaction and (2) favor the outgrowth of apoptosis-resistant subpopulations of lymphoid cells. 464 Expression of fluorescent or enzymatic reporters driven by gene-specific regulatory elements is used to study in vivo or ex vivo activity and distribution of specific molecular targets or mutant alleles in GEM models. However, an increasing number of studies show that reporters can be highly immunogenic. Indeed, response of the mouse immune system against classical reporter molecules (including enhanced green fluorescent protein, luciferase, and \u03b2-galactosidase) has been demonstrated. The inherent immunogenicity of reporter gene's products depends on different factors including the mouse's background strain as well as level of expression and tissue distribution/accumulation. It is therefore extremely important to consider carefully any potential variable associated with the use of genetic reporter systems for immunological studies in mice. [465] [466] [467] [468] [469] [470] Even the most recent and sophisticated strategies for genome editing, including the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 system, have demonstrated experimental caveats influencing the immune system. In addition to the potential immunogenicity of viral vectors in viral delivery systems, human and mice have demonstrated preexisting adaptive immunity to Cas9 homologues expressed by common bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The inherent immunogenicity of Cas9 is a concern not only for the preclinical application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, but also for its potential clinical use as gene therapy strategy. 471, 472 Future Directions in Mouse Immunology", "cite_spans": [{"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "457", "ref_id": "BIBREF405"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1259, "text": "458,", "ref_id": "BIBREF406"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1263, "text": "459", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1392, "text": "460", "ref_id": "BIBREF408"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1846, "text": "[461]", "ref_id": "BIBREF409"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1852, "text": "[462]", "ref_id": "BIBREF410"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1858, "text": "[463]", "ref_id": "BIBREF411"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2046, "text": "[461]", "ref_id": "BIBREF409"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2052, "text": "[462]", "ref_id": "BIBREF410"}, {"start": 2053, "end": 2058, "text": "[463]", "ref_id": "BIBREF411"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2505, "text": "464", "ref_id": "BIBREF412"}, {"start": 3358, "end": 3363, "text": "[465]", "ref_id": "BIBREF413"}, {"start": 3364, "end": 3369, "text": "[466]", "ref_id": "BIBREF414"}, {"start": 3370, "end": 3375, "text": "[467]", "ref_id": "BIBREF415"}, {"start": 3376, "end": 3381, "text": "[468]", "ref_id": "BIBREF416"}, {"start": 3382, "end": 3387, "text": "[469]", "ref_id": "BIBREF417"}, {"start": 3388, "end": 3393, "text": "[470]", "ref_id": "BIBREF418"}, {"start": 4022, "end": 4026, "text": "471,", "ref_id": "BIBREF419"}, {"start": 4027, "end": 4030, "text": "472", "ref_id": "BIBREF420"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microbiota and Microbiome"}, {"text": "Options to take advantage of humanized mice and other animals to study human derived immune elements in nonhuman surrogates are reviewed elsewhere.

Five of the 8 founder strains are \"classical\" laboratory strains including 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, NOD/ShiLtJ, and NZO/HlLtJ. Three founder strains are \"wild-derived\": CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ.

They have provided opportunities to study the evolution of complex genetic interactions. 573 The application of immunogenomics and immunonogenetics techniques on CC mice has identified QTLs, polymorphic regions, and candidate genes that control mouse immunodiversity 572 and have contributed to our understanding of susceptibilities to SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and Aspergillus fumigatus. 574-577 DO mice (https:// www.jax.org/strain/009376) were developed by random outcross matings of 160 CC RI lines, and the breeding strategy of continued random matings is designed to maximize their genetic diversity.
