Recent studies out of China have detailed ultrasound findings associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 4, 5 While these findings are not specific, they are likely clinically useful in patients with severe dyspnea in conjunction with a multi-organ evaluation of cardiac function and the inferior vena cava (IVC). Furthermore, we believe that these non-specific ultrasound findings can be used in conjunction with clinical and laboratory parameters to assist defining pulmonary involvement of SARS-CoV-2, especially as it typically involves peripheral lesions near the pleura, which are well demonstrated on lung ultrasound. Herein we present a case of SARS-CoV-2 related multifocal pneumonia diagnosed by POCUS in the ED during the initial triage of a return ED visit, which highlights its clinical utility and our proposed imaging pathway for evaluating patients with acute dyspnea during the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.",

Her lung exam was significant for poor inspiratory effort and rhonchi at the bases. A multi-organ POCUS exam was performed to determine the cause of the patient's dyspnea. A cardiac parasternal long-axis view demonstrated normal systolic ejection fraction and no pericardial effusion (Image 2). The IVC in the subxiphoid view showed greater than 50% collapse during inspiration (Image 3). A lung exam using a low frequency (5-2 megahertz) curvilinear transducer in the anterior, lateral, and posterior portions, showed the presence of diffuse scattered B-lines with small subpleural consolidations and effusions in each lung zone, with confluent B-lines in the posterior inferior lobes bilaterally (Image 4). POCUS findings were interpreted as the presence of a non-cardiogenic multifocal interstitial lung process with COVID-19 being high on the differential.

First, this approach allows to rapidly determine other common causes of dyspnea in the undifferentiated patient. Second, with a more protocolized pathway on early presentation, we hope to reduce the reliance on other imaging modalities (chest radiographs and CT) in a time when infection control is imperative.
