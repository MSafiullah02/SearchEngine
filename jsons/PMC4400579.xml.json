Only recently has attention been given to studying health in Chinese social media, primarily for the purpose of influenza surveillance [13-16]. Our recent study [17] analyzed the diversity of health content in messages from Sina Weibo (abbreviated as Weibo), a microblogging site popular in China. While many of the health topics were similar to those identified on Twitter (eg, influenza, common cold, exercise, and vision health), some topics were unique to China. Most notably, Chinese social media users often discussed pollution and air quality in China, a major Chinese public health issue [18], which receives less attention on Twitter [19].",

Air pollution is a major concern in China, where pollution levels are rising alongside rapid urbanization and industrialization [22,23]. Addressing air pollution requires localized surveillance of pollutant levels. Additionally, it is important to understand public awareness, concern, attitudes, health effects, and behavioral response to air pollution [24]. Researchers have investigated public perceptions of risk regarding pollutants [25], emotional and affective responses to air pollution [26], and behavioral responses to pollution, for example, to understand whether people are taking averting action such as staying indoors [27]. This knowledge is important for guiding public policy efforts to reduce pollution, for informing researchers building accurate models of pollution health effects, and for directing the public on how to best respond and protect themselves. So far, these studies have relied on traditional public health methods, such as surveys, for obtaining necessary data.",

Mining social media offers the potential for these trends to be identified in real time and on a massive scale. We mined Weibo messages for statements about air quality and pollution. We demonstrated two epidemiological uses of these data. First, we compared the volume of air quality messages with fine particle pollution in 74 Chinese cities to evaluate the effectiveness of social media for complementing air quality sensors. Second, we conducted a manual coding analysis of a sample of messages to evaluate the ability for measuring public perception, awareness, and response to pollution, a first step toward quantifying the impact of environmental factors on health.",

Since we obtained the most recent messages for each user, the bulk are from 2013 (68.42%, 63,789,097/93,225,579). To focus on the health aspect of air quality and pollution, we selected a set of 917,708 messages obtained by filtering using a list of 1282 health-related terms from a Chinese medical dictionary [28], as well as terms added manually, such as terms related to air pollution: pollution (\u6c61\u67d3), lungs (\u80ba\u90e8), and smog (\u70df\u96fe). These data were originally collected as part of a broad study into health topics in Chinese social media [17].

When estimating the parameters of this model, the topic-specific word distributions typically give high probability to words that tend to occur together in documents.

Extrapolating from a 67% relevance rate of 170 out of 15,763 messages, we estimate there are at least 10,000 messages about air quality in our crawled dataset. Additionally, our entire dataset contains only 93 million messages, a much smaller dataset than those typically used in Twitter research today; for example, Paul and Dredze [3] used a general collection of 2 billion messages to study health topics on Twitter. Since Weibo has more registered users than Twitter, we expect data collection targeted at obtaining air quality messages would obtain a much larger collection.",

This is information that cannot be captured with physical sensors, and instead relies traditionally on surveys, panels, and interviews. However, measuring the perceived level of pollution can be just as important as the objective level, as the perceived level is a stronger predictor of willingness to reduce pollution [26]. In this sense, social media reports are more akin to citizen complaints than physical sensors. Although not objective, citizen complaints can complement physical surveillance, and complaints often result in follow-up investigations by regulators in China [38]. Formal complaints likely have different characteristics than the informal complaints found in social media. Social media complaints tend to be general, and the threshold of perceived pollution before writing a complaint is quite likely lower in social media. As social media becomes a more common outlet for citizen complaints, the relationship between these systems of complaint will be important to understand [39].",

There is therefore a clear knowledge gap that social media data can help fill. A type of behavioral response of particular interest is response to public awareness campaigns or health advisories regarding pollution [40]. Because awareness campaigns and advisories may take place over a short period of time\u2014in some cases, just a single day\u2014it can be difficult to measure their outcome. This has motivated researchers to use Web-derived data to measure the effectiveness of such campaigns, for example using Web search activity to understand World Tobacco Day [41] and Breast Cancer Awareness Month [42]. Having shown that social media users report their perceptions and behaviors regarding air quality, we believe that this data could similarly be used to understand the effectiveness of pollution advisories. This falls into a broader trend of using digital data to support research in behavioral medicine [43].",

Previous research has shown that self-reports of health status can be combined with reports of air pollution exposure to understand the associated health effects [44,45]. Social media data, including our Weibo collection, offer passive self-reporting at a much larger scale than what can be collected through traditional, active methods, such as interviews. Such data can augment our understanding of environmental health effects, especially because social media reports include people who experience symptoms but do not seek care, and thus fall outside of what is captured in medical records. Furthermore, research on the health effects of pollution often focuses on more serious outcomes such as disease, while social media reports contain evidence of milder but still important effects, such as discomfort and irritability [24]. Indeed, reports of discomfort were so common in our dataset that we decided to exclude them from consideration as a \u201chealth concern\u201d in our coding analysis, yet there is clearly potential for the data to help quantify these effects.",
