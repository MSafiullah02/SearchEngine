The virus that causes SARS, which ultimately infected over 8000 people and killed 774, spread from a Hong Kong hotel when infected hotel guests began traveling across the globe (WHO 2003) . One of those infected was a flight attendant, who was ultimately linked to more than 100 SARS cases in Singapore (WHO 2003) . Encapsulated within this account lies a key phenomenon that influences disease dynamics: heterogeneity in transmission among individuals and across space. The risk of infection varies by location (eg hotels), by behavior (eg air travel), and especially among individuals.",

            "text": "Individuals who are responsible for a disproportionate number of transmission events, such as Typhoid Mary and the flight attendant carrying the SARS virus (Leavitt 1996; WHO 2003) , are characteristic of many infections in both humans and animals (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Hudson et al. 2008) . This underscores the importance of understanding transmission heterogeneity, defined as variability in the contribution of specific hosts or locations to overall rates of pathogen spread. Failure to recognize and incorporate heterogeneity into epidemiological models can result in poor estimates of rates of disease spread and outbreak probabilities, and represent a missed opportunity for effective disease control strategies (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Transmission heterogeneity also occurs between different species and across landscapes, and host and spatial transmission heterogeneity can interact positively, with each facilitating heterogeneity in the other. A better understanding of such linkages may enhance our ability to identify the hosts and environments that contribute disproportionately to transmission. In this paper, we consider the causes of, consequences of, and linkages between transmission heterogeneity across individuals, species, and locations. We suggest mechanisms for how pathogen transmission mode may influence transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space, and we advocate a quantitative approach that will allow researchers and managers to determine the magnitude of transmission heterogeneity across hosts, species, and environments (Panel 1). Finally, we offer future research directions (Panel 2) that could provide a framework for understanding and managing transmission heterogeneity.",

Such variability in transmission also exists among species within a community and among habitat patches across a landscape, underscoring the need for an integrative framework for studying transmission heterogeneity, or the differences among hosts or locations in their contribution to pathogen spread. Here, we synthesize literature on human, plant, and animal diseases to evaluate the relative influence of host, pathogen, and environmental factors in producing highly infectious individuals, species, and landscapes. We show that host and spatial heterogeneity are closely linked and that quantitatively assessing the contribution of infectious individuals, species, or environmental patches to overall transmission can aid management strategies. We conclude by posing hypotheses regarding how pathogen natural history influences transmission variability and highlight emerging frontiers in this area of study. Epidemiologists typically determine whether a pathogen can invade a host population by using the basic reproductive number (R 0 ). This value represents the average number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in an immunologically na\u00efve host population (Anderson and May 1991) . Subsequent work has shown that the intensity of macroparasitic infections (eg worms per individual) generally follows a negative binomial distribution with high skew (Shaw and Dobson 1995), with more highly infected individuals potentially being responsible for more transmission events. A later study proposed the \"20/80\" rule and showed that, in a variety of disease systems, 20% of hosts were responsible for at least 80% of transmission events (Woolhouse et al. 1997) . Thus, models allowing for heterogeneity in the distribution of the expected number of new infections an infectious individual produces (rather than using a single mean value, R 0 ) have transformed the epidemiological modeling of diseases by taking into account changes in disease dynamics that result from such heterogeneities (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Importantly, heterogeneous transmission also occurs in cases where amplification host species or environmental \"hotspots\" contribute disproportionately to disease transmission within a community or landscape ( Figure 1 ). Thus, one of the major goals of this paper is to extend the same principles that underlie host transmission heterogeneity to understand landscape variability in disease risk. Extreme cases of transmission heterogeneity have been referred to as \"superspreading events\". A useful definition for a superspreading event, proposed by Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) , is when an infected host causes a greater number of secondary infections than the nth percentile of the",

The importance in amplification, A j , of each host group relative to its abundance is then A j = (R 0,j /R 0 )/N j . To determine whether a host group is likely to be a superspreader at the nth percentile requires determining whether the observed value of A j is unlikely given an expectation of A j = 1 and the measurement error associated with estimating (R 0,j /R 0 ) and N j . This entails determining the probability of observing the estimated value of A j by comparing it to the ratio of two distributions that have identical means equal to N j but possibly different variances as determined by the measurement error of (R 0,j /R 0 ) and N j . The most appropriate distribution for N j and (R 0,j /R 0 ) for this comparison will be an important problem for further study, but one possibility is to use beta distributions, which are flexible and vary between 0 and 1. For non-vector-borne pathogens, a priori quantification of importance is much more challenging because empirically measuring the infectious contact rate among hosts is difficult. If possible, identifying measurable surrogates for infectious contact rates would aid discovery of host traits that are correlated with contact rates. Quantifying spatial heterogeneity and identifying the importance of hotspots relative to purely stochastic variation can follow the same methodology. Doing so requires defining the quantity of interest -the density of transmission events, the density of all infected hosts, or the density of infected hosts of one group or species. Subsequently, a hotspot at the nth percentile can be described if the quantity (eg number of transmission events) in that area divided by the fraction of the landscape of interest represented by that area (a number between 0 and 1) is greater than the nth percentile of the appropriate ratio of distributions as described above.",

For instance, experimental manipulations in birds and rodents have shown that males can be important drivers of population-level infection rates, and that elevated testosterone levels can suppress the immune response while increasing host contact rates (Ferrari et al. 2004; Mougeot et al. 2005; Grear et al. 2009 ).",

However, field observations revealed that disease levels (measured as number of symptomatic leaves per tree) at the plot scale were primarily associated with local environmental differences in temperature and precipitation rather than with genetic differences among hosts (Anacker et al. 2008) . The distribution of pathogens or vectors within the environment may also be a factor influencing host burdens and, by extension, transmission heterogeneity (Brunner and Ostfeld 2008) . For instance, when parasites are clumped together rather than scattered evenly across the environment, individuals that happen to encounter the areas with higher parasite densities are likely to experience higher infection intensities as a result.",

Additionally, immune system trade-offs in response to different types of pathogens (eg microparasites versus macroparasites) can increase the duration and intensity of infection in individuals harboring multiple pathogen types (Graham et al. 2007; Telfer et al. 2010; Hawley and Altizer 2011) . Co-infection may also reduce transmission potential as a result of cross-immunity and the contact-reducing behaviors of infected hosts (Rohani et al. 2003; Hawley and Altizer 2011) . Determining the impact of co-infections on transmission is an important direction for further research. Quantifying individual transmission heterogeneity can help direct disease management strategies (Panel 1). When individuals that contribute disproportionately to transmission can be identified from infection levels or transmission studies such as contact tracing, targeted control efforts can be considerably more effective at preventing and containing outbreaks than random control (Woolhouse et al. 1997; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Even more effective control is possible when individuals with the potential for disproportionate transmission can be predicted before infecting others (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Hudson et al. 2008) , for example based on host characteristics such as weight or sex (eg Perkins et al. 2003) . However, identifying superspreaders may be costly in terms of time and effort, highlighting the need for methods to calculate the cost-effectiveness of reducing R 0 via targeted versus untargeted population-level controls.",

For vector-borne diseases, it has been hypothesized that hosts that infect more vectors are associated with an \"r-selected\" (eg rapid turnover) life-history strategy (Cronin et al. 2010) . For example, experimental exposure of six grass species to barley yellow dwarf virus suggested that plants with a \"quick return\" phenotype (eg high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as high metabolic rates in leaves) had increased host susceptibility, competence, and vector population sizes, most likely because their leaves offered more resources for vector and pathogen growth and generally had fewer defenses (Cronin et al. 2010) . Such hosts enhance the population of infected vectors, increasing infection risk for co-occurring host species. Species that tend to have high population densities or show highly social behavior may also be at increased risk of contracting pathogens for which transmission is dependent on host density, resulting from higher contact rates (Altizer et al. 2003) . By elevating overall disease prevalence, such hosts can amplify transmission throughout multiple species' communities.",

With a definition analogous to that of superspreading individuals (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) , a superspreading species can be identified by determining the expected distribution of community-wide transmission events assuming homogeneous transmission potential across host species (Panel 1). A species responsible for more infections than the nth percentile of the expected distribution can be classified as a community superspreader (Panel 1; eg Kilpatrick et al. 2006) . When identifying superspreading species, the transmission event of interest should be defined explicitly. This could include transmission that is either intra-or interspecific, or to a host species of particular interest (eg humans or domestic animals), depending on the research or management objective. For WNV, Kilpatrick et al.

Environmental hotspots are often characterized by conditions that facilitate either elevated pathogen survival or greater densities of amplification hosts (for diseases with density-dependent transmission; Figure 2 ). For instance, Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria that causes cholera, can become concentrated on water hyacinths (Eichornia crassipes), which enhance the pathogen's survival (Spira et al. 1981) , potentially leading to transmission hotspots in areas that have been heavily invaded by water hyacinth. Similarly, Farnsworth et al. (2005) found that chronic wasting disease prevalence in Colorado mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations was twice as high near human developments as compared with that in more remote areas. This may have been caused by elevated deer densities that can result from artificial feeding stations, small home ranges, and lack of predators in developed areas.",

For instance, poor habitat quality and populations isolated in fragmented habitats can cause stress and reduced genetic diversity in host populations, thereby reducing host immunity and resulting in spatial variability in transmission potential across the landscape (Pearman and Garner 2005; Bradley and Altizer 2007). Nutrient enrichment can also elevate disease risk through changes to pathogen abundance and virulence, host and vector densities, or host susceptibility (Johnson et al. 2010) . For example, a study in Belize showed that nutrient enrichment of water bodies associated with agricultural areas supports different aquatic plant communities that promote breeding by an efficient malaria vector, Anopheles vestitipennis (Grieco et al. 2006) . Alternatively, fragmentation and nutrient enrichment can impede the spread of a disease by reducing host density and contact rates (Bradley and Altizer 2007; Johnson et al. 2010) .",

Marine salmon farms, in which high densities of captive salmon are maintained in coastal pens, are examples of transmission foci that can enhance sea lice infection pressure for nearby wild salmon by as much as four orders of magnitude (Krko\u0161ek et al. 2005) . Similarly, aggregation of children in schools enhances transmission of childhood diseases, such as measles (eg Bj\u00f8rnstad et al. 2002) . Social animal behaviors that tend to aggregate and increase contacts between hosts, such as those that occur at collective mating grounds (eg leks), overwintering dens, watering holes, and feeding sites, can also elevate disease transmission at those sites (Altizer et al. 2003 (Altizer et al. , 2006 . Cultural differences in human behavior can also influence disease transmission by shifting www.frontiersinecology.org \u00a9 The Ecological Society of America host-pathogen contact rates (Alexander and McNutt  2010) . For instance, regional differences in caregiving and nursing techniques may have contributed in part to differences in the rates of human-to-human transmission and mortality from Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh as compared with those in Malaysia (Chong et al. 2008) , creating regional heterogeneity in disease transmission. Quantitative methods for estimating the net contribution of hotspots to landscape-level transmission may facilitate control measures. Extreme levels of spatial transmission heterogeneity might lead to environmental hotspots that are analogous to superspreaders (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) , in that such patches are responsible for greater than the nth percentile of the expected fraction of regional transmission events (Panel 1). It is particularly important with spatial transmission heterogeneity to explicitly identify the transmission measure of interest before assessing the importance of transmission heterogeneity to disease dynamics. The relevant measure of transmission for habitat patches will depend on the management scenario and could include, for example, the number of farms infected by a single farm (Keeling et al. 2001) or the number of host infections that occur in spatially defined areas.",

Nonetheless, several issues surrounding the consequences of interspecific and spatial transmission heterogeneity for outbreak probabilities and epidemic trajectories are important avenues for future research (Panel 2). In addition, new theory for understanding when to expect transmission heterogeneity will improve disease mitigation strategies. Management could also be enhanced by identifying and addressing connections between host and spatial heterogeneity.

For instance, we hypothesize that heterogeneity in contact rates is more important than heterogeneity in infectiousness for creating superspreaders, because in an age of globalized travel and practices that increase host density, such as industrialized farming and habitat fragmentation, contact rates may vary more than infectivity. Another testable hypothesis is that specific pathogen transmission modes are more commonly associated with certain types of transmission heterogeneity. For instance, transmission variability across hosts may be more common among infections transmitted through vectors or direct host-to-host contact; this is because there are no intermediate transmission steps (eg to other obligate host species) that would dilute the influence of variable contact rates, competence, or infectivity on overall transmission. Environmental transmission heterogeneity may be more prevalent among pathogens with density-dependent transmission or environmentally transmitted stages, because transmission foci are often characterized by high host or pathogen densities. Empirical testing of these hypotheses will require quantitative approaches for identifying transmission heterogeneity (Panel 1) in addition to meta-analyses that integrate the results from multiple studies.",

            "text": "Connections between host and spatial transmission heterogeneity are likely common and could have implications for disease management. Logically, superspreaders create hotspots of transmission around them, and hosts in a disease hotspot, by definition, experience increased infection pressure as compared with others in the population. For example, interspecific transmission heterogeneities in Lyme disease can theoretically lead to environmental hotspots because fragmented habitats often support a higher fraction of competent amplification hosts, which could increase disease risk (eg measured as nymph infection prevalence) in disturbed landscapes (LoGiudice et al. 2003) . Environmental hotspots that occur as a result of temporary aggregation of hosts -for example, at a watering hole -could also facilitate individual superspreading by serving as a source location for infection among highly social individuals that disperse from the location and subsequently infect many others. Finally, heterogeneity occurs both among and within species, and amplification species may contain one or more superspreading individuals. For example, domestic dogs account for the majority of rabies cases in parts of rural Tanzania; infected dogs vary substantially in their biting rates, such that in addition to being the dominant amplification host in the system, some domestic dogs account for a disproportionate number of canine rabies transmission events (Hampson et al. 2009 ). These patterns suggest that a priority for future research in disease ecology should be the development of a framework integrating transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space (Panel 2).",

If, as hypothesized, contact rates play the greatest role in transmission heterogeneity, then quantifying contact networks representing the set of interactions between nodes (eg individuals, species, or environments) could provide a surrogate measure for identifying potential superspreaders (Figure 3 ; eg Keeling and Eames 2005) , particularly if traits characteristic of the highest contact nodes can be identified. Importantly, specific characteristics, such as the duration of infectiousness and contact, must be considered to determine the role of high contact nodes (eg Craft et al. 2011) . Additionally, because infectiousness frequently co-varies with susceptibility (Hudson et al. 2008; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2008) , another potential indicator for identifying possible superspreaders and amplification hosts could involve measures of susceptibility such as body condition, testosterone level, or immunocompetence (Beldomenico and Begon 2010) . Identifying the most infectious hosts before they infect others offers a superior management strategy to post hoc analyses that detect such hosts from infection levels or transmission studies; however, recognizing these individuals and determining the probability that they will become infected can be challenging. Intriguingly, advanced tools, such as therapeutic interfering particles (particles engineered to replicate along with the pathogen, but that inhibit pathogen growth), can eliminate the challenges of identifying superspreaders a priori because they are transmitted among hosts along with the pathogen, naturally making their way to the most high-risk populations (Metzger et al. 2011) . Further research that identifies the conditions under which easily observable host or landscape traits are associated with high transmission rates will aid targeted disease control efforts.",
