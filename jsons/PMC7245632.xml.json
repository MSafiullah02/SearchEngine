Considering the higher viral load detected in the nose, compared with the lower respiratory tract [2], this may be one of the first anatomical structures exposed to viral contagion as evidenced by the fact that acute anosmia is a relatively common presenting symptom [3, 4]. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, global health-care systems have faced the challenge of treating an overwhelming number of patients for which there is no widespread immunity. As a result, many off-label therapies have been tried but so far with uncertain results. In addition, the mild symptoms in the majority of cases and the saturation of hospital beds may compel doctors to treat the majority of infected people at home. In this situation, experimental treatments are not readily available to those at home or be available in low-resource setting [5].",

Inhalation of a water-based acetic acid solution to treat the symptoms of the common cold is a common folk remedy in Italy. Indeed, the anti-bacterial and anti-viral activities of acetic acid are documented in the literature [6\u20139]. Acetic acid causes inactivation and dis-aggregation of haemagglutinin glycoproteins (found on the surface of influenza viruses) by generating a low pH-dependent conformational change of those glycoproteins and it destroys the viral envelope and inhibits viral transmission [6]. Therefore, considering these antiviral properties and that the upper airways are the main site of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication, we have explored the use of this historical therapy in early-stage cases of COVID-19 by evaluating patients who were administered a disinfecting formulation of acetic acid as an intranasal aerosol.",
