The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS-CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS-CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.

Strikingly, SARS-CoV was also detected in many other organs and tissues, including stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal, liver and cerebrum ( Figure 3 and Table 1 ). However, the virus was not detected in oesophagus, thyroid, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, testis, ovary, uterus, heart, aorta, cerebellum or muscle (Table 1 ). These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal system may also be a primary target of SARS-CoV, ie virus in contaminated food and water may enter the human body through epithelial cells covering the surface of the gastrointestinal tract, although there is no direct evidence to show that food-borne SARS-CoV is transmitted through the gastrointestinal system. Other organs with detectable SARS-CoV may be secondary targets of SARS-CoV, ie the virions in blood that are released from the primary target (eg respiratory system) may infect cells in these organs and tissues. Another possibility is that SARS-CoV may not infect these cells, but rather binds specifically or non-specifically to their surface, resulting in detection of SARS-CoV antigens and RNA. The pathological changes in these organs and tissues may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect (CPE) mediated by SARS-CoV replication in these organs; or indirectly by the systemic toxic reaction due to failure of the respiratory system, or by the harmful immune response and cytokine reaction induced by virus infection. Aminopeptidase N (CD13) is a receptor for at least two human coronaviruses [26, 27] and was proposed as a receptor for SARS-CoV [28] . It was recently demonstrated that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [8] and a fragment in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein is responsible for binding of the virus to ACE2 [9] [10] [11] . Analyzing 72 human tissues by real-time PCR, Harmer et al [29] demonstrated that ACE2 is expressed in human lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, heart and testis. Consistent with our results, SARS-CoV was detected in lung, gastrointestinal tract and kidney, suggesting that SARS-CoV may utilize ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cells in these organs. However, it is unclear why the cells in heart and testis cannot be infected by SARS-CoV despite the expression of high levels of ACE2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 42, "end": 46, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 47, "end": 50, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1731, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1735, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1784, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1867, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1977, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1982, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 1987, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2052, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 346, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 351, "end": 358, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 513, "end": 521, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Consistent with the report of Leung et al, who used electron microscopic and histological examination of endoscopic biopsies and post mortem material [30] , we also detected SARS-CoV in the epithelial cells of the alimentary tract, including stomach and small intestine (Table 1 ).

This finding supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV may be released into the environment via faeces from individuals infected by SARS-CoV.
