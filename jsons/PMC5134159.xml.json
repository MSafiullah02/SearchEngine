Highest incidence of KD has been reported from Japan at 265/100,000 children below 5 years of age, followed by Korea and Taiwan.[6] Of all the children born in Japan, it is estimated that 1% would get KD by 10 years of age.[15] In Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, incidence of KD is above 50/100,000 children below 5 and has been progressively increasing. The incidence of KD in Japan has increased more than twice over the last 20 years.[1516] In contrast, United States and Europe report an incidence of less than 30/100,000 children below 5 and the incidence seems to have plateaued over time.[161718]",

This inflammation, which is a panarteritis, may result in the weakness of vessel wall. The increased vascular fragility results in dilatation of the affected vessel wall, which in severe cases, results in formation of aneurysms. Thrombosis and aneurysms of the coronaries were first demonstrated at autopsy in patients with KD by Tanaka et al. from Japan.[3738] Subsequent healing of the inflamed vessel may result in stenosis as well as thrombosis at the affected site, resulting in myocardial infarction at a later age.",

            "text": "Mortality in KD has been reported at 0.014% in Japan.[3] At our centre, it is higher at 0.87%, probably due to delays in diagnosis, referral, and treatment.[81] The risk of development of CAAs can be brought down to less than 3% if the condition is diagnosed in time and treated appropriately.[382] After the initial echocardiographic evaluation of coronaries, regular assessment is done at 2 weeks and then at 6 weeks.[3] Frequency of further assessment depends on the status of the coronary arteries. Smaller aneurysms are more likely to resolve as compared to large aneurysms. Furthermore, age of onset of aneurysms less than 1 year, fusiform aneurysms, and aneurysms located in the distal coronaries have an increased likelihood of resolution.[34] Giant aneurysms are associated with the risk of thrombosis and stenosis, which may manifest clinically as arrhythmias, congestive cardiac failure, and myocardial ischemia.[53] Patients with coronary lesions should, therefore, be followed up with regular echocardiography evaluation. It must be borne in mind that KD is a systemic vasculitis and not merely a disease that affects the coronary arteries. Recent literature suggests that KD can impact the cardiovascular system in several different ways and these sequelae may manifest several years later in young adulthood.[545556686970] It is for this reason that long-term follow-up is mandatory for all children with KD, irrespective of whether or not they have CAAs.",
