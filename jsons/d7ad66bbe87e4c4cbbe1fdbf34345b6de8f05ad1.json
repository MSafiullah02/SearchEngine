            "text": "Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, heteronormative ideology serves as a social force that maintains dominant group members' status (e.g., heterosexual men). Disgust may be an emotional reaction to gay men's violation of heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior) and motivate hostile attitudes toward gay men to promote interpersonal and intergroup boundaries. Based on this theoretical framework, we hypothesized that sexual disgust-compared to pathogen or moral disgust-would be most strongly associated with antigay hostility and would statistically mediate its relationship with heteronormativity. Heterosexual men in the United States (n = 409) completed an online questionnaire assessing heteronormative ideology, disgust sensitivity, and hostile attitudes toward gay men. Results support the hypotheses and suggest that gay men's sexual behavior is the most likely elicitor of disgust and antigay hostility, as opposed to a perceived pathogen threat or moral transgression. The findings indicate that heteronormative attitudes and sexual disgust are likely contributors to antigay hostility. Thus, intervention efforts should seek to improve tolerance of same-sex sexual behavior among heterosexual men, which may mitigate emotional reactions and hostile attitudes toward gay men.",

Although the primary purpose of disgust is thought to aid the immune system by instituting a behavioral response of avoidance to protect against infectious diseases and other illnesses (Neuberg et al. 2011; Rozin and Fallon 1987) , disgust also can be elicited from social stimuli, such as sexual acts and moral violations (Haidt et al. 1997; Rozin et al. 2008; Simpson et al. 2006; Tybur et al. 2009 ). Relatively recent research has begun examining disgust within intergroup contexts and how the emotion could produce hostile attitudes toward outgroup members (Cottrell and Neuberg 2005; Hodson and Costello 2007; Tapias et al. 2007 ). The current study, in particular, focused on the function of disgust as an emotional response to gay men as experienced by heterosexual men.",

(2009) propose that there are three domains of disgust (i.e., pathogen, moral, and sexual), each of which is elicited from distinct stimuli and serves a particular function, but has a similar affective state of repulsion. Pathogen disgust is elicited in response to physical stimuli, such as mold, open wounds, and other vehicles of disease transmission, for which the emotional response protects against the ingestion of substances that may be physically harmful to the self (Neuberg et al. 2011; Rozin and Fallon 1987) . For example, people who see mold on their food likely will experience pathogen disgust and, thus, remove themselves from the food by disposing of it in a trashcan. Pathogen disgust is particularly likely to be elicited within contexts in which pathogen threat is either immediately present or primed. Therefore, in situations where contagion is a salient threat, people are likely to behave in ways that diminish their risk (Tybur et al. 2014 ). An example can be seen through the general public's reaction to the recent coronavirus outbreak. Persistent media messages of contagion appear to have created avoidance of public areas and aversions to interpersonal contact, and they may have even contributed to prejudicial attitudes toward individuals who are perceived as infected (e.g., Chinese-Americans; Kesslen et al. 2020; Kwai 2020) . Pathogen disgust, in this context, may be the mechanism through which environment harvests behavior.",

            "text": "Moral disgust is the state of revulsion stemming from social transgressions, which includes an array of \"universally\" morally condemnable behavior (e.g., lying, cheating, and stealing). For example, observing a political leader deliberately manipulating constituents may elicit moral disgust and motivate negative attitudes toward, or removal of, the leader. Disgust in response to a moral violation is thought to promote avoidant behaviors toward violators because those who engage in immoral behaviors may be incapable of providing the reciprocity of benefits that are expected of in-group members. Instead, violators may be perceived to engage in costly interpersonal behaviors, such as stealing from, lying to, or more severe immoral behaviors such as killing (Tybur et al. 2009 ). Thus, avoidance of the violator may be self-protective. Within cultural contexts that are heavily influenced by religious ideology, such as politically conservative regions, sensitivity to moral disgust is prevalent (Rozin and Haidt 2013) . This may be because religious and conservative communities often have larger variability in the types of behaviors that are perceived as immoral, relative to more secular and liberal communities (Haidt and Graham 2007) . Therefore, moral disgust appears to be influenced by the stringency of traditional moral values.",

(2009) suggest that sexual disgust is elicited from sexual stimuli and partners who may be biologically costly for reproductive success. Other researchers, however, offer a counter-conceptualization that may be favorable for researchers adopting a sociocultural perspective. Morrison et al. (2018) suggest sexual disgust is likely to be elicited among people who possess rigid notions of sexuality. Thus, sexual stimuli and behavior that fall outside of culturally normative conceptualizations of sexuality are likely to elicit sexual disgust. For example, men who engage in sexual activity with other men may elicit sexual disgust among people who rigidly adhere to traditional notions of sexuality. Therefore, cultural contexts in which there are stern sexuality and gender norms are likely to have high prevalence of sexual disgust sensitivity. When sexual disgust is elicited, it would be expected to promote interpersonal avoidance and hostile attitudes because associating with individuals who engage in behaviors outside traditional sexuality may be a threat to self-status within a social hierarchy ; this perspective is described in more detail in the following).",

Initial work examining antigay attitudes suggests disgust is a common reaction to gay men and may reflect a prominent emotion in response to homosexuality (Herek 1986 (Herek , 1988 (Herek , 1993 . Indeed, Embrick et al. (2007) identified disgust as a theme in qualitative interviews exploring working class men's attitudes toward homosexuality in the workplace. More recently, research has begun to examine the outcomes of such emotional arousal. Several studies have presented results suggesting that people with increased disgust sensitivity report more antigay attitudes (Crawford et al. 2014; Inbar et al. 2009; Olatunji 2008; Terrizzi et al. 2010) and that the manipulation of disgust can amplify negative attitudes toward sexual minorities (Cunningham et al. 2013; Inbar et al. 2012 ). Meta-analytic findings have highlighted the robust association between disgust and antigay attitudes, with results indicating a moderate-to-large effect across studies . Interestingly, there is some evidence to suggest that the effect of disgust on attitudes is larger in response to gay men than to lesbian women (Cunningham et al. 2013; Inbar et al. 2012) , which may partially explain society's generally greater dislike of gay men compared to lesbian women (Bettinsoli et al. 2019) . Therefore, further research attentive to the influence of disgust on prejudicial attitudes toward gay men, in particular, seems warranted.",

            "text": "Researchers have sought to develop a theoretical framework to explain the particular function of disgust in response to gay men. Most research in the current literature utilizes the framework proposed by the behavioral immune system (Schaller 2006; Schaller and Park 2011) . Theorists suggest that over the course of evolution, humans have developed a behavioral immune system to protect against novel pathogens that could cause harm. This cognitive system is tasked with identifying contamination threats and initiating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses that serve to mitigate such threats (Schaller and Park 2011) . The primary way in which the behavioral immune system evokes adaptive behavioral responses is through the elicitation of emotion (Neuberg et al. 2011; Schaller and Park 2011) . Situations in which there are contamination threats-such as interpersonal contact with unfamiliar groups-are likely to elicit disgust, which would motivate the development of hostile attitudes and behavioral avoidance (Schaller and Park 2011) . These outcomes would be evolutionarily adaptive because they would decrease the likelihood of being exposed to deadly pathogens, which would bode in favor of the individual's reproductive fitness and eventual reproductive success (Cottrell and Neuberg 2005) . Proponents of the behavioral immune system suggest the framework can be adapted to explain disgust in response to gay men as well as subsequent antigay attitudes (Crawford et al. 2014; Inbar et al. 2009; Inbar et al. 2012; Terrizzi et al. 2010) . Specifically, gay men may be perceived as vectors of parasites and their presence could evoke disgust as a mechanism to create boundaries (Crawford et al. 2014; Inbar et al. 2012; Terrizzi et al. 2010) . The development of hostile attitudes would then aid behavioral avoidance by decreasing the likelihood of interpersonal contact with gay men (Inbar et al. 2012; Terrizzi et al. 2010 ).",

Although this is certainly possible, other theoretical frameworks would suggest that disgust and antigay attitudes stem from gay men's sexual behavior, implying that sexual disgust is most closely associated with hostile attitudes toward gay men. In the following we focus on the latter explanation. We outline a theoretical framework and describe an empirical study that tested the strength of association between the three domains of disgust and subsequent hostile attitudes.",

Theories concerned with group-based social hierarchies, such as social dominance theory (Pratto et al. 2006; Sidanius and Pratto 1999) , suggest social hierarchies can be arbitrarily structured to systematically privilege or discriminate against groups based on characteristics such as race/ethnicity, nationality, religion, or sexual orientation. Several distinct social hierarchies (i.e., based on discrete attributes) can concurrently exist within a single society (Pratto et al. 2006) . Each hierarchy is legitimized and justified through ideology (often referred to as \"legitimizing myths\") that is deeply embedded in social institutions, intergroup processes, and individual attitudes (Herek 2007 (Herek , 2016 Pratto et al. 2006) . For example, ideology operating to justify social hierarchical structures can be reflected through governmental regulations or policies, preferential treatment of dominant group members, and individual prejudices or stigma toward \"subordinate\" or minority group members (Herek 2007 (Herek , 2016 Herek and McLemore 2013; Pratto et al. 2006; Sidanius et al. 1994) . Such ideologies, and their subsequent outcomes, are expected to disproportionately benefit the dominant groupcompared to subordinated groups-at all levels of society (i.e., social institutions, intergroup processes, individual attitudes) in ways that serve to maintain dominate groups members' status atop the social hierarchy (Herek 2016; Jost and Banaji 1994; Pratto et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Within the United States, researchers note the existence of a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, which is maintained through heteronormative ideology (Hegarty et al. 2004; Herek 2007 Herek , 2016 Whitley and AEgisd\u00f3ttir 2000) . Heteronormativity can be conceptualized as an institutionalized social force that dictates acceptable behaviors based on the assumption that heterosexuality is normal (Habarth 2014; Kitzinger 2005; Yep 2003) . That is, heteronormativity defines boundaries of \"normality\" and sets expectations for men and women to behave and express themselves in accordance with traditional gender norms (Habarth 2014) . Although gender norms include general notions-such that men and women are expected to behave in a \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" manner, respectively-they also assume that men and women engage in heterosexual relationships and sexual behavior (Habarth 2014; Kitzinger 2005) . In this way, individuals who strongly internalize heteronormative ideals conceptually intertwine gender and sexuality. Thus, heteronormative men are likely to perceive that they must engage in sexual behavior with women, and not men, in order to be sufficiently masculine (Herek 1986; Kitzinger 2005) . Those who engage in behaviors outside of heteronormative ideals-such as people who engage in same-sex sexual behavior (e.g., gay men)are presumed to be inferior, which could be used to justify their lower status (relative to heterosexual people) within a social hierarchy (Herek 2007 (Herek , 2016 Whitley and AEgisd\u00f3ttir 2000) .",

First, gay men may serve as a threat to the stability of society and social institutions that have historically favored heterosexuality Nagoshi et al. 2019; Whitley and AEgisd\u00f3ttir 2000) . Because gay men engage in sexual behavior that violates heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior), they could be seen to disrupt the ideology that maintains the arbitrarily set social hierarchy. This may be threateningparticularly among dominant group members who strongly adhere to heteronormative ideology-due to the more recent inclusion of gay men in American culture and institutions. Specifically, the inclusion of gay men in social institutions that had been previously reserved for heterosexual people (e.g., marriage) imply that norms are shifting and there is heightened openness to sexual behavior that falls outside the realm of heteronormativity. The credibility and inclusion of gay men is further evidenced by the recent historic presidential run by the first openly gay candidate, Pete Buttigieg (Fitzsimons 2020) . Such a shift in norms could subsequently alter the social hierarchy in ways that no longer give structural preference to heterosexual people Nagoshi et al. 2019) .",

Nagoshi et al. (2019) explain that others' deviations from normative gender behavior are a threat to the social status of the observer. This may be because heteronormative ideology prescribes stringent gender and sexuality norms (e.g., exclusive engagement in other-sex sexual behavior) for which men are expected to adhere if they wish to be considered sufficiently masculine by societal standards (Herek 1986 ). In some cases, proximity with violators of heteronormativity (e.g., gay men) may increase the likelihood of being misclassified as gay, thus threating the masculinity and social status of nearby heterosexual men. Consequently, heterosexual men may seek to avoid (Bosson et al. 2006; Bosson et al. 2011; Buck et al. 2013) or differentiate themselves from gay men by displaying antigay attitudes or behaviors (Bosson et al. 2011; Herek 2016; Parrott 2009; Parrott and Zeichner 2008) , which would assist in preserving their individual status within a heteronormative social hierarchy.

            "text": "In response to the threats we outlined, disgust may be evoked as a self-protective emotion that motivates cognitions and behaviors aimed at mitigating threats to status within a social hierarchy. Hodson and Costello (2007) suggest that disgust can function to enhance intergroup boundaries and protect group status. More specifically, disgust evoked among high-status groups-in response to lowerstatus groups-would motivate hostile attitudes toward lower-status groups, which may produce systematic discrimination toward such groups. Thus, disgust would serve to exclude lower-status groups from social institutions and enhance group-based social hierarchies in favor of the dominant group. However, disgust reactions are stronger in response to gay men than many other social groups (Cottrell and Neuberg 2005; Crawford et al. 2014; Tapias et al. 2007) , suggesting the emotion of disgust may be selectively induced in response to \"threatening\" social groups holding specific characteristics. Crawford et al. (2014, p. 221) provide results demonstrating that disgust sensitivities among U.S. residents are most strongly related to negative attitudes toward groups who violate \"traditional sexual morality,\" such as gay men. Therefore, it seems sexual behavior that is beyond cultural norms may be particularly disgust-eliciting. In accordance with these data, it would be expected that gay men's sexual behavior would be the disgust-eliciting stimuli producing hostile attitudes. Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, gay men's sexual behavior is in stark contrast to the ideology that maintains it (i.e., heteronormativity) and, thus, may be perceived as deviant, impure, or abnormal (Crawford et al. 2014; Herek 2007 Herek , 2016 .",

It also would be adaptively beneficial for heterosexual men who strongly internalize heteronormativity to develop increased sensitivity to sexual stimuli, which could be used to continually monitor violations and help to avoid emasculation and a deterioration of status. When encountering a violation of heteronormativity (e.g., gay men), disgust may be elicited as a threat response and initiate hostile attitudes to avoid or dissociate at an individual level (Buck et al. 2013 ), but also motivate social exclusion at an institutional level ).",

The current study tests these assumptions b examining the relationships among heteronormatively, disgust sensitivity, and antigay hostility. Based on frameworks proposed by groupbased social hierarchical theories, we first hypothesized that sexual disgust sensitivity will statistically mediate the relationship between heteronormative ideology and hostility toward gay men (Hypothesis 1). Second, we expected that the indirect effect (i.e., statistical mediation) through sexual disgust would be significantly stronger than the indirect effects through pathogen disgust (Hypothesis 2) or moral disgust (Hypothesis 3). Finally, we hypothesized that heteronormativity will directly predict antigay hostility (Hypothesis 4).",

As we stated in prior section, the global fit indices of the model-with the exception of Chisquare Test of Model Fit-displayed good model fit (ML \u03c7 2 [80] = 127.631, p < .001; RMSEA = .038; CFI = .987; SRMR = .036) and produced an R 2 of .288 in antigay hostility (p < .001).

Of particular interest, heteronormativity predicted sexual disgust, but did not predict moral or pathogen disgust.

            "text": "The current study examined the relationship among heteronormative ideology, the three domains of disgust (i.e., pathogen, moral, sexual), and antigay hostility to test theoretical assumptions. Results indicated that the relationship between heteronormativity and hostility toward gay men was indirectly mediated by sexual disgust, but not pathogen or moral disgust. Further, the indirect effect through sexual disgust was significantly stronger than the indirect effects through pathogen or moral disgust. However, the direct effect from heteronormativity to antigay hostility was stronger than any of the indirect effects through the disgust constructs. These results suggest that theory surrounding the behavioral immune system may not adequately explain the phenomenon of antigay hostility. Rather, theory concerning group-based social hierarchies may provide greater insight. More specifically, the framework posed by the behavioral immune system suggests that disgust responses and hostile attitudes toward gay men are the result of pathogen threat (Crawford et al. 2014; Inbar et al. 2009; Inbar et al. 2012; Terrizzi et al. 2010) , whereas theory examining social hierarchies indicates a different hypothesis. Social hierarchical theories could lead to the logical assumption that gay men's sexual behavior may be particularly disgust-eliciting and result in antigay hostility. It was conceptualized that group-based social hierarchies based on sexual orientation are maintained by heteronormative ideology (Hegarty et al. 2004; Herek 2007 Herek , 2016 Whitley and AEgisd\u00f3ttir 2000) , which communicates strict norms of sexuality and gender expression that favors heterosexual people (Habarth 2014; Herek 2007 Herek , 2016 . Gay men's sexual behavior could be perceived to violate heteronormativity (Kimmel 1997; Parrott 2009; Parrott and Zeichner 2008) , which could threaten the stability of society and status of dominant group members (e.g., heterosexual men; Kiss et al. 2018; Whitley and AEgisd\u00f3ttir 2000) . Thus, disgust may be elicited and subsequently motivate cognitions and behaviors (e.g., hostile attitudes; social exclusion) that serve to enhance group boundaries (Hodson and Costello 2007) .",

This notion is supported by the established theoretical framework proposed by the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock 1974) , which suggests health behavior is affected by an individual's perceived susceptibility to a disease, the perceived seriousness of the disease, and perceived benefits and barriers to taking action (i.e., adjusting behavior). In the 1980s and 1990s, mass-media campaigns were introduced to alert the public to the seriousness of and their susceptibility to HIV/AIDS. These campaigns may have induced a change in behavior causing people-particularly with high levels of pathogen disgust sensitivity-to avoid risky sexual situations and people perceived as infected (e.g., gay men). Examining disgust sensitivity and antigay hostility in areas where gay men are particularly stigmatized as disease carriers-compared to areas where they are notcould be an insightful avenue of future research.",

Although we were concerned with heterosexual men's attitudes toward gay men, specifically, it is important to our theorizing to note that lesbians-who also violate heteronormativity idealsdo not pose a threat to heterosexual men's status at the individual level; instead, lesbians only threaten heterosexual men at the institutional level (i.e., disrupt the social hierarchy maintained through heteronormativity). Due to the considerably smaller threat posed by lesbian women, it is expected that heterosexual men would have smaller disgust reactions to lesbians (but still experience some level of disgust) relative to gay men. Subsequently, heterosexual men should have less severe prejudicial attitudes toward lesbians compared to gay men. Because a majority of disgust research examining the two groups utilizes a conflated category, such as lesbians and gay men , it currently is unclear if lesbians elicit less disgust than gay men. However, previous research indicates that men's prejudicial attitudes toward lesbians, while extant, are less severe than they are toward gay men (Bettinsoli et al. 2019 ). Therefore, it is possible that lesbians pose a smaller threat to the social hierarchy and elicit less disgust than gay men, but this line of research is too young to make conclusions.",

Therefore, increased research attention should be devoted to understanding perceptions of gay men's sexual behavior and why it elicits disgust. We hypothesize that disgust is elicited because gay men's sexual behavior violates heteronormativity, and this speculation is supported by the observed relationship between heteronormativity and sexual disgust sensitivity. In addition to advancing understanding of links among heteronormativity, disgust, and antigay attitudes, the current study also contributes to the current literature more broadly, which suggests that emotions have the ability to affect judgments, attitudes, and behavior toward certain social groups (DeSteno et al. 2004) , particularly those who elicit such emotions (Tapias et al. 2007) .",
