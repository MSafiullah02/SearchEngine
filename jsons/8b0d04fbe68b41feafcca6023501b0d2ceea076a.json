This is not meant to be a comprehensive review, but rather an overview to stimulate debate and discussion. The article starts with a brief consideration of high-priority risk factors, but the main focus is on global events and trends that might affect health promotion policy and practice (referred to hereafter as 'health promotion'). We attempt to identify some practical implications that may need to be considered by practitioners and policy makers in the future.",

            "text": "Tobacco control. Although recognised as a 'blue chip' public health investment, 4, 5 there is disquiet about the level of tobacco control funding in Australia. [4] [5] [6] While considerable progress has been made in tobacco over the past 20 years, continued effort is needed. Comprehensive, long-term, government-funded interventions targeting individuals and population groups and policy and legislative change are still essential to prevent tobacco use initiation; reduce tobacco use; and reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. 5 In addition, a higher level of funding to tobacco advocacy groups is required to enable pressure to be maintained on political leaders for continued legislative reform. 6 Obesity and overweight. The global epidemic of overweight and obesity is raising concerns about the likely unprecedented future health, social and economic costs 9 unless the epidemic can be curbed. [9] [10] [11] 14 In Australia, about one-half of adult women and almost two-thirds of adult men are overweight or obese 15 and there are growing levels of obesity in children 16 and older adults. 17 It is generally agreed that the dramatic change in weight status seen globally over the past two to three decades is due to an energy imbalance caused by changes in the environment: 18 that is, the creation of 'obesogenic environments' that promote excessive food consumption (e.g. increased reliance on foods away from home, food advertising, marketing, promotion and pricing of food 19 ) and discourage physical activity. 6, 8, 20 The alarming trends -particularly in childhood obesity -have prompted calls for strategies that mirror public health's efforts in tobacco control. These include the need for the formation of advocacy groups with the specific aims of curbing food marketing to children 16 through the media and schools, preventing manufacturers, restaurants and fast-food outlets using increased portion sizes as a marketing tool; as well as overcoming real and perceived barriers to children walking and cycling to school.",

            "text": "Mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2020 in developed countries, unipolar depression will be the third-leading cause of disability-adjusted life years and self-inflicted injuries the 10th-leading cause. 12 These trends are likely to have major effects on the health budget. 13 In Australia in 1996, mental disorders were the leading cause of years of healthy life lost due to disability and the thirdleading cause of the overall burden of disease. 3 It is estimated that nearly 18% of Australians had experienced mental health disorder symptoms in any year. 21 Recently, the National Heart Foundation recognised depression, social isolation and lack of social support as independent risk factors for coronary heart disease. 22 Moreover, Marmot and colleagues identified lack of control, social isolation and lack of social support as social determinants of health that help explain health inequalities. 23 Prevention efforts are ideally placed in childhood because experiences in childhood lay the foundation for mental health later in life. 24 In addition, promoting good mental health also has synergies with promoting physical activity because participation in physical activity positively influences mild depression. 25 Encouraging greater participation in society (e.g. through sport and the arts) also can beneficially influence mental health by providing opportunities for meaningful participation, increasing self-mastery, enhancing social support and decreasing social isolation. [26] [27] [28] Mental health promotion at local and State levels is often hampered because no lead agency perceives the topic as its priority area. Given WHO's prediction of an increase in mental health problems, leadership at the local and State level is critical for implementing effective prevention programs.",

Thus, they concluded that at the population level, individual-level interventions aimed at strengthening individuals and families are limited in terms of their ability to narrow health differentials. Programs that include environmental change aimed at reducing structural barriers are essential. Community development strategies were also identified as a high priority as they focus on strengthening local communities by building community ties and networks. Given that perceived control is a key concept in understanding socio-economic differences in health, 28 empowering disadvantaged groups by providing opportunities to drive their own interventions may be doubly beneficial.",

Predisposing factors that contribute to violence include alcohol and drug abuse, social isolation, and stressful events or circumstances including poverty. In addition, social inequalities resulting in an unequal access to resources is a major factor contributing to violence.

            "text": "We live in an ageing society. In developed countries worldwide, it is predicted that by 2020 the population aged 65 years and over will have increased by 71%. 12 In Australia in 2001, 12% of the population was aged 65 years and over. This is estimated to rise to 16% by 2016 and by 2051, more than six million Australians will be aged over 65 (25%). A number of reviews have considered the impact of an ageing population on health costs and have suggested that the changing demographic composition of Australia will have a considerable but manageable effect on the projected cost of health services. 51 Increased expenditure associated with an ageing population is predicted to be offset by a decline in resources required for youth programs and education. 52 Nevertheless, some suggest that it is not so much the cost of an ageing population that threatens a blowout in health expenditure, but rather the cost of increasing quality of health technology and delivery. 52 In recent years, disability rates in older age have declined, largely as a consequence of positive behaviour choices in early life. Many health problems in older life can be postponed or delayed by adopting healthier habits in early life, 53-55 thus strategies implemented now will have a major impact on the health of future older cohorts. Primary prevention behaviours (such as physical exercise, healthy diet, moderation of alcohol use, not smoking and use of cancer screening) help prevent frailty and delay the onset of disability. [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] Encouraging older people to remain active as they age is also a priority 55 and is now a key strategy in some countries. 56 To this end, the WHO has initiated a Global Movement for Active Ageing with a specific focus on physical activity. 53, 54 However, strategies that promote mobility and independence, as well as reduce social exclusion and increase social support, 56 are required to ensure individuals can achieve personal goals and can contribute to society. 57 Individual and environmental interventions that prevent falls, encourage regular exercise and encourage better use of pharmaceutical medicines have the potential to prevent the loss of function and improve quality of life in older people. 55 Thus, the main focus of health promotion interventions in older people is to maintain and improve function (e.g. maintain or increase physical activity) and to maintain and increase quality of life (e.g. reduce social isolation by encouraging meaningful participation and access to public transport). Our field has a major part to play in facilitating such active participation (e.g. lobbying for access to public transport).",

Improvements in technology and accompanying productivity have created a timepressured, faster and more stressful pace of life. 18 These changes in time pressures affect a range of health risk factors including stress, diet, physical activity and access to social support derived from family and friends. Time constraints hinder community participation, civic engagement and volunteerism -all important elements of social capital. 42 In terms of obesity and overweight, Hill 18 suggests that the quest for improved productivity and efficiency has increased the demand for getting a 'better deal' and may be contributing to the rise in 'super sizing' of product lines as a way of competing for the fast-food dollar. Moreover, increasing demands on time have reduced traditional food preparation, increased the demand for pre-packaged foods, and increased the need for people to get to places quicker rather than walk. While it may not be possible to change the pace at which we live, we need to take time pressures into account when designing programs and, particularly, in terms of creating supportive environments.",

            "text": "We continue to unravel the mystery of life. The full potential of the sequencing of the human genome will not be realised for some time. While only about 2% of deaths in the US may be attributed to purely genetic disease, McGinnis 61 estimates that about 60% of deaths have some genetic component; for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Genomics-based drugs are expected to enter efficacy trials over the next few years 38 and new interventions with specificity for individual vulnerabilities to environmental and behavioural factors will become available. There is some evidence, for example, that the propensity towards being spontaneously active could be influenced by genotype. 62, 63 Future interventions will aim to alter genetic determinants of disease and disability. 64 Despite the potential of the human genome, behavioural choices represent the single most important factor influencing our health and the choices we make are affected by the choices available. 64 Thus, social determinants will remain strongly associated with health and will continue to require intervention. As suggested by McGinnis, 61 whether a gene is expressed can be determined by environmental exposures or behavioural patterns, but the nature and consequences of the choices available are affected by our social circumstances. Similarly, the type of health care we need may be determined by our genes, but the type of Giles-Corti et al. Article health service we receive may be determined by our social circumstances. Health promoters and policy makers will still have a key role to play in changing behaviours and the environment in the future to minimise the impact of a genetic predisposition and to reduce the impact of non-genetically related risk factors.",

But there are also a number of challenges. These include concerns that an awareness of genetic predisposition may foster a sense of fatalism and erode self-responsibility for health behaviours 66 and that predictive genetics can lead to adverse psychosocial consequences, anxiety and mental health problems for affected individuals and their families. 66, 67 Public understanding and responses to genetic information and advances have implications for both health promotion practice and research, as does our evolving knowledge of the interactions between genetics, environments and individual behaviour. Health promotion practitioners and policy makers need to keep a watching brief on developments over the next five years, with a view to being responsive to advances in the area of genetics.",

Globally, there are calls for leaders with the potential to inform, motivate and work in complex environments and across sectors. 64 Others have suggested that while we have trained numerous health promotion practitioners to be technically competent, there are questions about whether we have trained leaders who can lead the field into its next phase of development. 68 Funding bodies and employers in our field are becoming aware of this need. For example, VicHealth and Healthway both fund leadership development programs. However, in addition to health sector leaders, we need leaders in other sectors who are sympathetic to health-related issues. For example, leaders who can work with Indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse communities to initiate community development programs are required, as well as sport, arts and other leaders who can increase active participation among those living in disadvantaged areas. Academics and health-sector policy makers need to be thinking broadly about developing leaders who can meet the challenge of addressing social determinants of health by working creatively with sectors outside of health, as well as the numerous advocacy challenges that lay ahead.",

Although not a new idea, we have re-emphasised the need for the field to focus on advocacy to create supportive infrastructure, legislation and healthy public policy, as well as the need for building effective partnerships if it is to redress social inequalities in health. Moreover, performance indicators and methods of evaluation will need to change if these broader determinants of health are to be the focus. Health promoters in the 21st century will have to compete for attention with numerous other priorities and communicators, as well as the stresses and strains associated with uncertainty, busy-ness and the pace of technological and societal change.
