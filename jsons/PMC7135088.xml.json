In the early decades after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, China was able to achieve impressive health advances and was internationally recognised as a superior health performer.1 Economic reforms over the past three decades have sparked unprecedented economic growth, including large reductions of income poverty. Although health gains have continued, concern for the equitable distribution of social benefits of economic progress has grown. China's health inequalities are increasing, gains slowing, and public dissatisfaction mounting. The Chinese government increasingly recognises these challenges and is responding to them. Reform of health care has been ongoing for several years,2 And earlier this year, after the 17th Chinese Communist Party Congress, the Ministry of Health announced major new policy directions for achieving Healthy China by 2020:3\n",

One straightforward method is to compute shortfalls in life expectancy or excesses of avoidable deaths relative to some feasible standard, such as the level already achieved by the most advantaged group in the population. For example, if all Chinese provinces had the same infant mortality level achieved by the prosperous municipality of Shanghai (5\u00b71 per 1000 livebirths), some 374 000 infant deaths in the rest of China would have been avoided in 2000. Adopting Sen's approach of comparing China's sex ratio with that achieved in countries without substantial gender bias, the number of missing women in China was estimated as 34\u00b76 million in 1990. This is equivalent to an astounding 6\u00b73% of the female population in China.19 By 2000, the number of missing women had increased to 40\u00b79 million (6\u00b77%).19\n",

The combination of rapid economic growth and unprecedented rate of commercialisation has brought about notable market failures, none more spectacular than those in the health-care sector. Market failures occur when public goods, such as public health, are not produced sufficiently and in proportion to need. These failures have been compounded by information asymmetry, in which health providers have much greater information than patients on prices and quality of treatments and drugs. Under such conditions, providers can use their knowledge to persuade patients to spend more on services that will not necessarily lead to the best health gains, as has been happening in China.26 Providers, for example, have been prescribing tests, drugs, and procedures that will make them the most profit\u2014causing cost escalation, unnecessary or even dangerous practices, and poorer quality care.

This decline hit the most disadvantaged in the rural areas hardest. In urban areas, a new Urban Employee Basic Health Insurance Scheme has been developed to replace the Government Insurance Scheme and Labour Insurance Scheme, which led to a rapid escalation in health-care costs in the 1980s and early 1990s. Overall coverage of government-run schemes decreased from 44% to 39% over the period 1998 to 2003, while there was an increase from 11% to 16% in coverage by non-mainstream insurance, including commercial schemes. The proportion of the urban population without any form of health insurance was static at around 44% over these 5 years.32 Coverage increased with age and was highest for men and high-income groups, and Xu and colleagues32 concluded that inequities in the urban insurance system were increasing. In addition, between 1993 and 1998, the proportion of the population who had to pay out-of-pocket for health care increased from 28% to 44%.33 In poor rural areas, the proportion having to pay out-of-pocket was estimated as being as high as 90%.34\n",

            "text": "China has been acclaimed as a miracle economy, achieving 9% annual growth per head for more than 25 years, and is poised to overtake Germany as the third largest economy after the USA and Japan.40 The benefits of growth, however, are not distributed equitably. Disparities in income and wealth between the urban and rural areas, between the eastern and western regions, and between households have widened substantially. In 1990, the richest province had a GDP per person more than seven times larger than the poorest province, but by 2002, the same ratio had grown to 13 times greater.41 The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality,42 increased for China as a whole from 0\u00b731 in 1978\u201379 to 0\u00b745 in 2004. The level of income inequality in China is now similar to that in the USA, roughly comparable to that in the most inequitable Asian countries\u2014Philippines and Thailand\u2014and approaching the notoriously inequitable levels in Brazil and Mexico.43\n",

In 2003, public spending was 48 times higher in the richest than the poorest counties. China's richest province spent over eight times more per head on public services than the poorest.41\n",

From 1981 to 2001, the proportion living in extreme poverty, as defined by the Chinese Government, declined from 53% to 8%, with half of the decline occurring in the first half of the 1980s.46 The bulk of this early reduction in poverty came from rural areas and was helped by one-off agricultural reforms in the early 1980s and lower taxes on farmers. The pace of reduction then stalled in the late 1980s and early 1990s, recovered again in the mid-1990s, before stalling again in the late 1990s.46 Poverty reduction has been uneven across provinces and has become inversely related with economic inequality\u2014provinces that had a more rapid rise in economic inequality within the province made less progress against poverty. In addition, Ravillion and Chen46 found that poverty in China has become more responsive to rising inequality. One disturbing consequence of this, they contend, is that provinces with the greatest inequality will face a double handicap in their attempts to reduce poverty in future: \u201cthey will have lower growth and poverty will respond less to that growth\u201d.",

From the national household health survey of 2003, we estimated that about 55% of the correspondents from both the lowest income and highest quintile group were not satisfied with inpatient services, and 40% and 45%, respectively, were not satisfied with outpatient services. The most important reason for this dissatisfaction was the cost of health care, followed by low quality of care and unnecessarily complicated procedures involved in obtaining service. In an analysis of the national household health surveys in 1998 and 2003, Xu53 found that out-of-pocket payment for hospital care increased for all income groups in the 5 years between surveys. People in the lowest income group paid the highest proportion of their hospital costs out of pocket (>60%), and even the highest group paid nearly half (48%) of their hospital expenditure out-of-pocket. Although the lower the income group the more likely people are to be ill and in need of health care, expenditure on hospital care declines with income, so expenditure is not relative to need (table\n).53\n",

More specifically, China now recognises that the market will not meet needs for the good of society. The Government is thus now accelerating its public investment in modernising its public-health system including disease prevention and health promotion, and establishing three health-insurance schemes: a rural cooperative medical scheme, urban employee basic health-insurance scheme, and urban resident health-insurance scheme in recent years and a medical financial-assistance scheme for poor people. These reforms aim to ensure better access of the Chinese population to essential health care, but there is much more to do (on raising the level of reimbursement and helping people living in poverty, for example) to move towards universal access.",

Universal coverage of essential health care is being promoted. Public facilities have to be deincentivised from profit-seeking to remain economically viable. Policy and regulations are being developed to change incentives. Drug and pharmaceutical policies and regulations are being revamped. More robust and rigorous academic studies, done jointly by Chinese and international academics, have been encouraged to guide China's health-system reform. Effective correction of market failure, improvement in the government role in health care, and introduction of fairer processes are largely dependent on whether these government commitments and activities can be effectively implemented in the provinces, districts, and counties in the near future.",
