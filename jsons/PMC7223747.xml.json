Although personal self-care strategies and institution-sponsored programs are both essential for physician well-being, workplace initiatives likely have greater impact in reducing burnout.8,13 Although some institution-sponsored programs may be effective, little is known about who uses them and how likely they are to be utilized.8 Of particular importance is understanding which programs/services physicians wish they had available, as this may help target interventions to specific physician audiences and suggest new possibilities to explore.",

We hypothesize that desired interventions will be influenced by subspecialty as well as by individual personality characteristics, and that there is a disconnect between wellness programming that is offered to pediatric subspecialists and what they themselves truly desire.",

In our study population, nearly two-thirds of participants had some education about burnout, whereas less than half had received education about compassion fatigue. Greater knowledge about the prevalence of these phenomena, as well as their signs and sequelae, may help pediatric subspecialists recognize the importance of integrating self-care routines into their daily lives. We identified differences in personal self-care practices based on subspecialty, sex, and personality characteristics. While it is perhaps not surprising that PC providers were the most engaged in self-care outside of the workplace,24 it was unexpected and concerning that NICU physicians in our sample were less involved than the other subspecialists in activities that strengthen social/emotional connections in private life. That female study participants were more likely to utilize social/emotional liaisons for self-care is also not surprising, given what is understood about differences in relational styles between men and women.25 Similarly, that \u201cextroverts\u201d participated in activities with greater social/emotional connection and that \u201cneurotics\u201d were more likely to engage in \u201cnegative\u201d habits and utilize mental health services was notable but not entirely unexpected.26,27",

This raises important questions about how institutions determine which wellness interventions to provide. Are pre-implementation needs assessments being performed?29 Or are less systematic smatterings of activities simply put in place to \u201ccheck the box\u201d of providing physician wellness opportunities? Availability of an institution-sponsored wellness intervention in no way guarantees that the target audience of physicians knows it exists, uses it, or finds it effective in easing compassion fatigue or burnout. In our cohort, nearly 20% of participants reported having \u201cno idea\u201d what institution-sponsored self-care activities were available to them. Because it can be extremely difficult for a distressed or \u201cburned-out\u201d physician to seek support, it is disheartening that dissemination of this information may be so variable and/or inadequate. That barriers to participation differed by sex and personality traits speaks to the importance of providing more than a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to what is offered. In our population, while there were significant differences in utilization of institution-sponsored wellness activities across subspecialties, the overall utilization rate was ~60%. While this level of involvement in self-care at work is somewhat encouraging, it does not in any way speak to the effectiveness of these interventions. Given the current alarming levels of burnout and dissatisfaction among physicians nationally, some institution-sponsored wellness activities may not be as beneficial as intended.8",

It is not possible to compare variables between those who responded to the survey and those who did not. However, because pediatric academic subspecialists share similar attitudes and behaviors, it is possible that responders and non-responders have comparable characteristics and thus provide similar responses. Contact information for some study participants may have been outdated; thus, our response rate may actually have been higher than our calculation.37 We did not query participants about feelings of distress or well-being on the day of survey, but either of these sentiments may have impacted participation and/or responses.
