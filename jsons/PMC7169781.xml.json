Indeed, many proteomic and functional RNAi genetic screens revealed that modulation of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), nuclear transport receptors and the RAN\u2010GTPase system have profound effects on viral replication.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 For instance, interactions between viral proteins, nucleoporins (Nups), RAN, importin\u2010\u03b1 (IMP\u2010\u03b1), importin\u2010\u03b2 (IMP\u2010\u03b2) and exportin (EXP) have been observed with hepatitis C virus (HCV),1, 6, 7 picornavirus,8 and human immuno\u2010deficiency virus (HIV)\u20101.9, 10 In HCV infection, viral proteins (core, NS2, NS3 and NS5A) harbor a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and/or nuclear export signal (NES)11, 12 suggesting that nuclear\u2010cytoplasmic shuttling is important for it virus life cycle that is mostly within the cytoplasm.6 Indeed, Nups were reported to accumulate in virus\u2010induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2010derived membranous structures where HCV replication occurs (so\u2010called membranous webs), indicating that Nups can gate these cytoplasmic compartments to promote viral RNA replication and to prevent cytosolic RIG\u2010I\u2010like receptor (RLR) sensing of viral RNA.6, 7, 13 This is further supported by the findings that silencing IMP\u03b21, TNPO1 (KPNB2) and RAN, all involved with nucleocytoplasmic transport and elucidated to interact with NS3/4A protein, decreases HCV replication.1 For many negative\u2010sense RNA viruses (NSV) including Sendai virus (SeV), the nuclear trafficking of the matrix protein has been reported to be critical for efficient production of viruses and to their pathogenesis.14 Viruses also co\u2010opt nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to facilitate transport of viral RNAs. Influenza A virus, one of the few NSV to replicate in the nucleus, uses NS1 to form an inhibitory complex with nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) and NTF2\u2010related export protein 1 (NXT1/p15) to block mRNA export,15 while interaction of its nucleoprotein (NP) with NXT1 promotes the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) in an EXP1\u2010dependent manner.16\n",

The translocation of macromolecules (>40\u201060 kDa) across the NPC is facilitated by the IMP\u2010\u03b2 family proteins, which are nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors (NTRs) that primarily carry nuclear proteins and small RNAs as their cargoes through the nuclear pores. The human genome encodes 20 species of IMP\u2010\u03b2 family NTRs, of which 10 are nuclear import receptors, 7 are export receptors, 2 are bi\u2010directional receptors and RanBP6 that the function is undetermined.30 IMP\u03b21 is one of the best\u2010studied member of the IMP\u2010\u03b2 protein family that mediate import of proteins into the nucleus either directly or indirectly through binding of adaptor proteins that belong to the IMP\u2010\u03b1 family.30 These adaptors recognize proteins that contain a classical NLS and connect IMP\u03b21 and cargo molecules for their translocation in the nucleus. As such, IMP\u03b21 contains 19 tandem HEAT sequence repeats, which binds cargo\u2010IMP\u2010\u03b1 complex through HEAT repeats 7\u201019,31 RAN via HEAT repeats 1\u20103, 6, 7, 13 and 1432, 33 and FG\u2010Nups via HEAT repeats 5 and 6 for the translocation of cargo through NPCs.34 Many proteins are also recognized directly by specific NTRs of the IMP\u2010\u03b2 family (TNPO1, TNPO2, TNPO3/IPO12) without the intervention of IMP\u2010\u03b1, and often contain a proline\u2010tyrosine NLS (PY\u2010NLS) motif.27 Conversely, EXP\u20101/CRM1, through interaction with NES, and others such as EXP\u20102/CSE1L, \u20105, \u20106, \u20107, \u2010t and RanBP17 facilitate protein export to the cytoplasm. Finally, the direction of cargo transport is mainly controlled by GTP\u2010binding nuclear protein Ran (RAN) across the nuclear envelope. RAN in the nucleus dissembles NTR\u2010cargo import complexes, releasing the cargo and allowing NTRs to translocate back to the cytoplasm,35 whereas RAN bound EXP\u2010cargo complexes in the cytoplasm are dissembled when RANGTP is hydrolyzed to RANGDP by GTPase\u2010activating protein 1 (RANGAP1) and RAN binding proteins.36\n",

Factors with the greatest inhibitory effects are functionally associated with protein transport by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Notably, all candidates were determined to interact with NS3/4A protein, which is well\u2010known for its role in evading the antiviral response. The effects of silencing proteins associated to nucleocytoplasmic trafficking were investigated for IFNB1 production through the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and nuclear factor\u2010kappa B(NF\u2010\u03baB) p65 TFs upon viral infection. By a microscopy\u2010based high\u2010content screening combined to gene silencing, we identified several proteins that reduce the number of IRF3\u2010 and p65\u2010positive nuclei within a 10 hours period post\u2010infection decreasing IFNB1 production. We also identified proteins that delayed, increased or had a differential effect on IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, and similarly reduced IFNB1 production upon gene knockdown. Depletion of the main import carrier IMP\u03b21 showed the most significant decrease in IFIT1 (ISG56) expression, which correlated with rapid increase of viral protein levels and virus\u2010mediated apoptosis. We found that expression of NS3/4A triggers the cleavage of IMP\u03b21 to evade IFNB1 production in cells that are knockout (KO) for mitochondrial antiviral\u2010signaling protein (MAVS) and reconstituted with an NS3/4A cleavage\u2010resistant MAVS variant (C508R). Moreover, expression of cleavage\u2010resistant IMP\u03b21 variant fully restores signaling and IFNB1 induction, similar to the treatment of infected cells by BILN 2061 protease inhibitor, correlating with the disappearance of IMP\u03b21 cleavage products.

The biological significance of these host proteins with an RNAi silencing screen further revealed that majority of these interactors are not affecting virus replication. However, HCV replication is often monitored in the RIG\u2010I deficient Huh7.5 cell line such that one cannot assess if the viral\u2010host protein interactions benefit the virus through subversion of the innate immune response resulting in increased viral replication and pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we silenced 132 selective HCV\u2010host interactors (Figure S1, Supporting Information) using ~5 independent short hairpin RNA (shRNA)\u2010expressing lentiviruses, and measured the induction of IFNB1 promoter\u2010driven firefly luciferase upon SeV infection of A549 human lung carcinoma cells and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)293T cells. We previously showed that SeV infection predominantly activates the RLR pathway in these cells, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB and IRF3 TFs, induction of IFNB1 mRNA and secretion of IFN\u2010\u03b2 cytokine.37 In parallel, cells harboring a luciferase gene driven by the nonimmune endogenous elongation factor 1 alpha (EEF1A1) promoter were used to assess the effects of shRNAs on basal transcription. The gene silencing screens revealed 35 modulators of antiviral response in HEK293T cells and 29 modulators in A549 cells (Figure 1). In total, 53 HCV\u2010host interactors, with 11 identified in both cell lines, specifically altered IFNB1 reporter expression by at least 2 independent shRNAs without affecting the constitutive expression of the EEF1A1 promoter (Table S2). The effect of silencing these 53 genes on modulation of HCV replication and antiviral response is summarized in Figure S2. Notably, 12 proteins significantly affected both viral replication and IFNB1 induction. Overall, the data provide evidence that viruses can hijack cellular processes that contribute to the innate immune response and viral replication giving a dual growth advantage.",

Owing to their physiological function, we hypothesized that the observed effects on IFNB1 induction are associated with the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 in response to a phosphorylation event upon viral infection.41, 42 The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB have been reported to be mediated via IMP\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 and EXP1\u2010dependent pathways,43, 44, 45, 46 while a more recent study indicated that the import of NF\u2010\u03baB p65 mainly relies on the canonical IMP\u03b11/IMP\u03b21 pathway following tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) stimulation.46 The Nups involved in these processes, however, are yet to be determined. To test our hypothesis, we developed a microscopy\u2010based screen to quantify the translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 to the nucleus in a kinetic analysis of SeV infection. Figure 2A details the RNAi microscopy screening methodology. Briefly, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking genes are silenced in A549 cells cultured in transparent 96\u2010well plates by lentiviruses encoding shRNA for 4 days to allow for the efficient knockdown of the targeted gene. Five independent lentiviruses per gene (1 per well) are used at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. A control shRNA expressing a non\u2010target sequence (shRNA NT) is included in each 96\u2010well plate. Knockdown cells are then infected with SeV for 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 hours, fixed, and permeabilized prior to nuclear labeling with Hoechst and IRF3 or NF\u2010\u03baB p65 immunostaining. Images are captured in 9 pre\u2010determined fields per well, under an Operetta High Content Screening (HCS) microscope. Images are then processed using the Harmony software to delimitate the nuclear region and to measure the fluorescence intensity of IRF3 or NF\u2010\u03baB p65 within the nucleus. For each 96\u2010well plate, a fluorescence cut\u2010off is set to allow the automated discrimination of cells with (green) or without (red) IRF3 or NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear staining (Figure 2A). This information allowed us to calculate the percentage of cells with IRF3 or NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear staining, and to evaluate the effect of each shRNA on SeV infection\u2010induced nuclear translocation of TFs.",

Graphical representations of these results are plotted using the percentage of positive nuclear staining for IRF3 or NF\u2010\u03baB p65 (Figure 2C). Over the course of a 10\u2010hour SeV infection, we observed an increase in both IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear staining culminating to ~75% positive cells at 5 hours post\u2010infection, followed by a decrease to ~30% at 10 hours. The microscopy data are confirmed biochemically with cell fractionation and western blot analysis (Figure 2D). As expected, we observed that IRF3 phosphorylation on Ser386 began at 1 hour, culminated at 5 hours and then decreased at 10 hours post\u2010infection, consistent with the amount of total nuclear IRF3 observed at these time points. The phosphorylated forms of IRF3 could also be observed using the anti\u2010IRF3 antibody in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Moreover, phosphorylation of the NF\u2010\u03baB negative regulator NFKBIA on Ser32\u2014which triggers its ubiquitination and degradation\u2014gradually increased from 1 to 10 hours post\u2010infection. NFKBIA degradation then allowed for NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, which began at 1 hour, culminated at 5 hours and subsequently decreased at 10 hours post\u2010infection. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction purity was confirmed by exclusive histone 1 (H1) staining in the nucleus and constant cytoplasmic NF\u2010\u03baB p65 levels (coupled with the absence of NF\u2010\u03baB p65 in the nucleus in the absence of SeV infection).

Notably, the effect of these adaptors on IRF3 was more variable\u2014but IMP\u03b13 also increased IRF3 translocation; whereas IMP\u03b16 (KPNA5) knockdown resulted in delayed IRF3 and diminished NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation. Alternatively, functionally grouped NTRs mostly attenuated nuclear translocation (Figures 4 and S4), which are expected of IMP\u2010\u03b2 nuclear import receptors; however, TNPO2 knockdown showed delayed translocation for both TFs, and differed from TNPO1's knockdown phenotype (Figures 4B and S5). Moreover, knockdown of the main export carrier EXP1 increased nuclear translocation of TFs, in contrast to EXP2 (CSE1L), with transient and sustained kinetics for IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65, respectively (Figures 4C and S6). Interestingly, IMP\u03b16 and RANBP3 knockdown both caused a delay in IRF3 translocation and a transient decrease in NF\u2010\u03baB p65, suggesting that RANBP3 utilizes IMP\u03b16 as an adaptor (Figures 4C and S6). Figure 5 displayed a decrease of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation for the knockdown of most Nups that are categorized by their localization within the NPC, with the exception of NUPL2 (Figures 5A and S9) and NUP43 (Figures 5B and S10). Specifically, NUPL2 knockdown cells increased IRF3 translocation at very early stages of infection, and correlated with EXP1 knockdown effect, which is expected as NUPL2 promotes EXP1 function.47 Furthermore, NUP43 knockdown cells showed a similar nuclear translocation phenotype for both factors, as seen with IMP\u03b16 and RANBP3 knockdown, suggesting that NUP43 plays a functionally significant role in RANBP3\u2010IMP\u03b16 import complex through the NPC.",

For this, A549 knockdown cells for IMP\u03b21, TNPO1, EXP1, EXP2 and RAN were infected with SeV for 8 and 24 hours (Figure 6). Notably, IMP\u03b21 knockdown led to a drastic and rapid increase in SeV protein levels when compared with those of control cells transduced with shRNA NT. This is further accompanied by nearly a complete inhibition of the antiviral response at 8 hours as measured by IFIT1 (ISG56) protein induction. Similar data are observed with HEK293T (Figure S13). These results suggest that IMP\u03b21 is targeted by HCV NS3/4A protein to disrupt IFNB1 production, reminiscent to a similar mechanism employed by HCV to prevent the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and type I IFN signaling.1 Using 3 independent shRNAs specific to IMP\u03b21, we confirmed that its depletion significantly hindered IFNB1 induction of SeV\u2010infected cells correlating with the reduced nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 when compared with the shRNA NT (Figure 7A). Indeed, we showed that IMP\u03b21 knockdown led to a strong decrease in IRF3 nuclear translocation at 3 and 5 hours post\u2010infection, before returning to normal levels at 8 and 10 hours post\u2010infection. A similar pattern was observed for NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, although with a less drastic decrease at 3 and 5 hours post\u2010infection, and culminated with increased nuclear NF\u2010\u03baB p65 staining at 8 and 10 hours post\u2010infection compared with that in presence of shRNA NT. In addition, we used caspase\u2010mediated poly [ADP\u2010ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) cleavage\u2014that generates 89\u2010 and 24\u2010kDa fragments\u2014to assess virus\u2010mediated apoptosis. Correspondingly, we observed that the rapid increase in SeV protein levels of IMP\u03b21\u2010depleted A549 cells was accompanied by an accelerated induction of apoptosis that started 1 hour post\u2010infection instead of 3 hours post\u2010infection in control shRNA NT expressing cells (Figure 7B).",

Co\u2010immunoprecipitation experiments were run to validate the NS3/4A\u2010IMP\u03b21 interaction (Figure 7C). BILN 2061, a potent NS3/4A\u2010specific protease inhibitor (PI), was used as an additional control.48 Interestingly, aside from the expected interaction, western blot analysis revealed the recognition of an additional IMP\u03b21 fragment only with protease active NS3/4A and in the absence of BILN 2061 PI. An amino acid sequence within IMP\u03b21 C\u2010terminus was found to be concordant with the cleavage consensus of NS3/4A protease. The resulting sizes of predicted fragments agreed with the molecular weights of bands observed in western blot analysis: 97 kDa for full\u2010length IMP\u03b21 vs 89 kDa for cleaved IMP\u03b21 (Figure 7C). The cleavage at this site could rationalize the NS3/4A interaction\u2010mediated prevention of IRF3/NF\u2010\u03baB p65 as well as STAT1 nuclear translocation.1, 49 To assess a role of NS3/4A\u2010mediated cleavage of IMP\u03b21 in subverting IRF3/NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, we investigated the IFNB1 promoter\u2010driven luciferase upon SeV infection in cells that expressed a NS3/4A protease cleavage\u2010resistant MAVS variant, mutated at Cys\u2010508 for an arginine (MAVSC508R),50 and MAVS wild\u2010type (WT) as control. We engineered MAVS KO cells using GeneArt gRNA, Platinum Cas9 nuclease and Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX Cas9 Transfection Reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific51 to reduce competition between endogenous and ectopically expressed MAVS proteins. We first demonstrated that expression of NS3/4A completely blocks SeV\u2010mediated IFNB1 production of MAVS KO cells reconstituted with the WT protein, which is completely restored by BILN 2061 PI (Figure 8A). More importantly, NS3/4A is still able to inhibit IFNB1 of SeV\u2010infected cells that are reconstituted with the MAVSC508R variant, blocking up to 70% of the IFNB1\u2010driven luciferase induced by control cells in the absence of active NS3/4A protease. Furthermore, BILN2061 PI restores IFNB1 and IFIT1 induction, correlating with the disappearance of IMP\u03b21cleavage (Figure 8A,B). To confirm this, we constructed an IMP\u03b21 variant that is mutated at multiple residues within the cleavage consensus of NS3/4A protease (D812A, C817S and A818G), including Cys\u2010817 as the major determinant to produce a cleavage resistant IMP\u03b21 (IMP\u03b21CR). The expression of IMP\u03b21CR but not of IMP\u03b21 WT completely restores IFNB1 production of MAVSC508R\u2010reconstituted cells expressing NS3/4A protease upon infection, similar to the treatment with BILN 2061 PI (Figure 8C). The IMP\u03b21\u2010dependent nuclear transport of IRF3 was also investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy in MAVS KO cells reconstituted with the MAVSC508R variant and kinetic analysis of SeV infection (Figure 8D). NS3/4A protease expression greatly hindered IRF3 and IMP\u03b21 from being transported to the nucleus with a major reduction at 4 hour post\u2010infection. Remarkably, complete restoration of IRF3 nuclear positive cells are observed upon expression of IMP\u03b21CR, similar to the treatment with BILN 2061 PI (Figure 8E,F). Altogether, the data demonstrate that NS3/4A protease\u2010mediated cleavage of IMP\u03b21 inhibits innate immune response to viral infection by restricting nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB.",

            "text": "The goal of the study was to elucidate novel proteins, families or processes that affected innate immune response from a subset of human proteins previously elucidated to be interacting with HCV proteins. We found that majority of host interactors did not affect HCV replication,1 although their knockdown was performed in the Huh7.5 cell line that is deficient for the RLR signaling pathway. Thus, we postulated that these host interactors may counteract viral replication by modulating antiviral response thereby providing a plausible explanation for their targeting by viral proteins. To test this hypothesis, we used a SeV model of infection and RIG\u2010I competent cells, and found that silencing expression of 53 of 132 interactors had a significant effect on IFNB1 production (Figure 1). Moreover, depletion of 12 of these 53 interactors was previously reported to reduce HCV replication in RLR\u2010deficient Huh7.5 cells (Figure S2), providing strong evidence that viruses through host interactions can hijack cellular processes involved in the modulation of innate immune response and additionally contributing to the virus replication life cycle giving a dual growth advantage. The GO term analysis of the 53 interactors revealed enrichment in nuclear protein import and export processes (Table 1). Interestingly, the interactors associated to the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of proteins (IMP\u03b21, TNPO1, EXP1, EXP2 and RAN) exhibit 2 main characteristics\u2014a potential to interact with NS3/4A (Figure S1), and a functional relevance to SeV\u2010induced IFNB1 promoter inhibition (Figure 1). Correspondingly, IMP\u03b21, TNPO1 and RAN decrease HCV replication upon their depletion in the Huh7.5 cell line,1 confirming the targeting of key players of the nuclear transport cell process to concurrently evade innate immune response and to promote virus replication. To gain mechanistic insight of the modulation of IFNB1 antiviral response by these interactors, we developed a microscopy\u2010based high\u2010content screening assay that directly evaluates the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 over a 10\u2010hour viral infection time course. The assay was validated biochemically using nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation (Figure 2D), and supported by the kinetics of phosphorylation of IRF3 and of the NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor NFKBIA upon virus\u2010mediated induction of antiviral response. The combined high\u2010content microscopy and medium throughput gene silencing screen approach was used to measure the dynamics and phenotype of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation as a valuable readout of the early antiviral response. We expanded the silencing screen to study genes involved in the NPC from the different sections of the pore (Figures 5, S9 to S12) as well as those involved in protein import, protein and mRNA export and RAN energy gradient (Figures 3, 4, S3 to S8). The screen provides a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear trafficking of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 at different early time points of a viral infection. Moreover, the study has linked 33 nuclear transport factors that modulate the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 as cargo proteins to the induction of an antiviral cellular phenotype.",

NF\u2010\u03baB p65 was reported to be transported by IMP\u03b13 and IMP\u03b14 while a more recent study identified IMP\u03b11 as the most critical adaptor for its nuclear translocation upon tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) treatment.43, 44, 46 Our results largely support these studies with a predominant role of IMP\u03b11 and IMP\u03b14, except for the depletion of IMP\u03b13 that may be over\u2010compensating by other adaptors causing the increase of NF\u2010\u03baB p65 during viral infection. In addition, the need for fast activation upon viral infection must not require a process that is dependent on IMP\u03b13 as its knockdown has no impact on IFNB1 production. Our data also demonstrate that IMP\u03b21 is one of the main import receptor for IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 import upon viral infection (Figure 7), as previously reported for NF\u2010\u03baB p65.46 However, other carriers have been identified for NF\u2010\u03baB p65 import including IPO8,46 which transports this factor in a NLS\u2010independent fashion after stimulation TNF\u2010\u03b1. In our study, knockdown of IPO8 resulted in a decrease IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation during the entire time course of infection and reduction of IFNB1 production (Figures 4A and S4), suggesting that an NLS\u2010independent import process for IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 may take place during viral infection. We also identified the import carriers TNPO1 and IPO7 as their knockdown reduces nuclear translocation of both TFs (Figures 4A,B, S4, S5), which supports the finding of a PY\u2010NLS that is recognized by TNPO1.52 Finally, knockdown of IPO4, TNPO2 and IPO12 affect irregularly or at later time NF\u2010\u03baB p65 and IRF3 nuclear translocation (Figures 4, S4 and S5), suggesting a weak if any contribution to these processes in a virus\u2010dependent manner. IMP\u2010\u03b2 family NTRs involved in protein export have significant effects for IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation and IFNB1 production, but also have pleiotropic effects on cell survival. Nevertheless, EXP1 was previously shown to bind IRF3 NES, and the use of EXP1 inhibitor leptomycin B further demonstrated an accumulation of IRF3 in the nucleus.45 Our results support EXP1 as the main carrier for IRF3 export causing nuclear accumulation of IRF3 during the early phase of the infection upon it knockdown (Figures 4 and S6). This is further supported by RANBP3 knockdown, an EXP1 cofactor for protein export,53, 54 which increases nuclear translocation of IRF3 at 8 hours of SeV infection but surprisingly without affecting IFNB1 production (Figure S6). Among all EXP family members, only EXP1 systematically exported NF\u2010\u03baB p65 at all time confirming a previous study.46 Despite the increased nuclear levels of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65, EXP1 knockdown decreased IFNB1 promoter activity following SeV infection (Figure S6). This may be explained by an effect on cell survival and/or by the fact that residual NF\u2010\u03baB p65 can re\u2010associate with I\u03baB\u03b1 to reduce it transcriptional activity when sequestered in the nucleus.55, 56 Interestingly, EXP2 knockdown causes a dramatic decrease of nuclear IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 during the entirety of the SeV infection time course leading to a significant reduction of IFNB1 and cell fitness (Figure S6). This is possibly due to its major role for the export of IMP\u2010\u03b1 adaptors to the cytoplasm as a recycling mechanism of import complexes.57 We also identified NXF1 and NXT1 proteins that significantly reduced nuclear import of IRF3/NF\u2010\u03baB p65 and IFNB1 production (Figures 4D and S7). These proteins are exploited by several viruses to promote viral mRNA export and inhibit host mRNA trafficking.20 Further studies will be required to demonstrate if the diminished amounts of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 proteins translated and able to enter the nucleus are due to the reduced export of their mRNAs to prevent antiviral response. The silencing of RAN, NUTF2 and RCC1 equally affected IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation and IFNB1 production, while only RAN silencing affected cells survival (Figures 4E and S8). As NUTF2 is responsible for recycling RANGDP back to the nucleus and RCC1 for exchanging the GDP to GTP, these data confirm that the lack of RANGDP or RANGTP in the nucleus affect nuclear transport with IRF3 being less affected than NF\u2010\u03baB p65. Nevertheless, the silencing of RAN components NUTF2 and RCC1 decreasing IFNB1 production without affecting cell fitness (Figure S8) further corroborate that this process is critical for ensuring proper nucleocytoplasmic transport required for antiviral response. Finally, multiple Nups had a similar silencing phenotype with the reduced nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 at early time of SeV infection (Figure 5). The silencing of cytoplasmic FG\u2010Nups (RANBP2 and NUP214) and of outer\u2010ring Nups (NUP107\u2010160 complex) regulating the diameter of NPCs58 further correlated with a decrease of IFNB1 production (Figures 5A,B, S9 and S10). The linker Nups, which are extremely important for the proper assembly of the NPC and recruitment of NUP62 for transport competency, also contribute to IRF3/NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear transport (Figures 5C and S11). Indeed, NUP93 and NUP88 knockdown decrease the translocation of both TFs and IFNB1 production as previously reported.37, 59 At last, central FG\u2010Nups NUP54 and NUPL1 (encoding NUP58 and NUP45) also significantly reduce IFNB1 production, in contrast to the weak phenotype of NUP35 (Figures 5D and S12).",

            "text": "Very importantly, our data revealed a unique phenotype of IMP\u03b21 knockdown by the complete inhibition of IFIT1 induction at early time point post\u2010infection, correlating a rapid and drastic increased of SeV protein levels (Figures 6 and S13). Mechanistically, inhibition of the nuclear translocation of both TFs explains the strong reduction of antiviral response in IMP\u03b21\u2010depleted cells. Interestingly, their nuclear localization are inhibited at early time points but return to normal levels despite the silencing of IMP\u03b21 (Figure 7A), demonstrating that the transient reduction of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 in the nucleus is sufficient to delay IFNB1 response to foster viral replication and cell apoptosis (Figure 7B). Remarkably, HCV NS3/4A protein interaction with IMP\u03b21 can counteract IFNB1 production by disrupting IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 nuclear transport upon induction of a cellular antiviral state. We previously reported that the silencing of IMP\u03b21 phenocopied HCV infection in preventing STAT1 from accumulating in the nucleus, thus providing strong evidence that the interaction between NS3/4A and IMP\u03b21 mediates the blocking of STAT1 nuclear accumulation to promote HCV replication.1 We now provide evidence that IMP\u03b21 targeting by NS3/4A can hinder nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65. We demonstrated a cleavage of IMP\u03b21 in cells expressing NS3/4A protein and inhibition of this cleavage by treatment with BILN2061 PI. An amino acid sequence within IMP\u03b21 C\u2010terminus was found to be concordant with the cleavage consensus of NS3/4A protease, and the resulting sizes of predicted fragments agreed with the molecular weights of bands observed in western blot analysis (Figure 7D). More interestingly, the cleavage at this putative site (cysteine 817) occurs within HEAT repeat 18, which is required for interaction with adaptor proteins of the IMP\u2010\u03b1 family through an IMP\u2010\u03b2 binding (IBB) domain.31, 60 This could therefore rationalize the NS3/4A\u2010dependent prevention of IRF3/NF\u2010\u03baB p65 as well as STAT1 nuclear translocation.1, 49 By using MAVS KO cells reconstituted with a MAVSC508R variant to prevent interference of NS3/4A with early MAVS signaling, we confirm the NS3/4A\u2010mediated cleavage of IMP\u03b21 as a novel HCV strategy to evade IFNB1 production (Figure 8). Indeed, expression of IMP\u03b21CR completely restores SeV\u2010mediated IFNB1 production, similar to treatment with BILN 2061 PI, correlating the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and the disappearance of IMP\u03b21 cleavage. Interestingly, the truncated IMP\u03b21 protein still interact with NS3/4A protein (Figure 7C), which may promote viral replication by its relocalization to the membranous webs. Future studies are required to validate the phenotype of IRF3/NF\u2010\u03baB p65 localization seen in NS3/4A\u2010expressing cells in the context of HCV infection, and the contribution of the cleaved N\u2010terminal IMP\u03b21 fragment (aa1\u2010817) at Nups\u2010containing cytoplasmic compartments to promote viral RNA replication. Nevertheless, such viral strategy for evading IRF3/NF\u2010\u03baB signaling of IFNB1 production while also disrupting STAT1\u2010mediated IFN signaling might be more common than previously believed as predicted for several viruses: SARS\u2010CoV ORF6 targets IMP\u03b21 to block STAT1 nuclear import25; EMCV Leader protein binds RAN and completely disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport8; FMDV 3C protease induces IMP\u03b15 degradation to block STAT1/2 nuclear import61; Nipah virus W protein interacts with IMP\u03b13 and IMP\u03b14 to inhibit the activation of the IRF3\u2010responsive promoter17; and Ebola virus VP24 protein interacts with IMP\u03b16, blocking STAT1 nuclear import and inhibiting ISG production.18, 19 In this context, our work does not only allow insight into this complex nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery by elucidating components involved in the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB but also identifies host proteins targeted by multiple viruses to evade immune response as potential therapeutic targets to treat a broad range of viral infections.",

Using a microscopy\u2010based RNAi screen, we identified 33 proteins involved with the nuclear transport of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 as cargo and induction of IFNB1 upon virus infection. More specifically, we showed that IMP\u03b21 and related TNPO1, EXP1, EXP2 and RAN, elucidated as HCV NS3/4A interactors, mechanistically control the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB. Furthermore, NS3/4A is able to cleave IMP\u03b21, restricting IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB p65 from being transported to the nucleus, in a novel viral strategy to abolish IFNB1 production. Overall, the data support an innate evasion \u201chot spot\u201d that underlines the importance and redundancy of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins for optimal antiviral response.
