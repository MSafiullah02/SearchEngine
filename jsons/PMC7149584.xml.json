            "text": "A.T. Glenny and coworkers were the first to demonstrate the adjuvant effect of aluminum compounds in 1926. Glenny prepared a variety of diphtheria toxoid precipitates and investigated their immunogenicity. Among these were toxoids precipitated by the addition of potassium alum [KAl(SO4)2:12H2O]. Glenny observed that injecting the diphtheria toxoid as an alum precipitate led to a significant increase in the immune response against the toxoid.3, 4 Vaccines prepared in accordance with this principle have been used in practical vaccination and are referred to as alum-precipitated vaccines. This approach, however, has a number of drawbacks. It was found5 that such preparations could be highly heterogeneous, depending on which anions, such as bicarbonate, sulfate, or phosphate, were present at the time of precipitation, e.g., as buffer constituents or growth media residues in the antigen solution. In addition to this, Al precipitation with the antigen takes place under alkaline conditions, and this may in some cases introduce alterations to the antigen. In contrast, preformed aluminum hydroxide, in the form of hydrated colloid \u201cgels,\u201d has the ability to adsorb protein antigens from an aqueous solution and such gels can be preformed in a well-defined and standardized way.6 Vaccine preparations based on adsorption of the antigen onto a preformed aluminum hydroxide adjuvant are referred to as aluminum-adsorbed vaccines, in contrast to the alum-precipitated vaccines mentioned earlier. Data on the use of alum-precipitated vaccines can be found in the older literature,7 but in practical vaccination, the adsorption onto preformed aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate gels has now almost completely substituted the alum precipitation in vaccine formulation. Aluminum phosphate was introduced as an alternative adjuvant two decades after Glenny's work. In 1946, Hans Ericsson from Sweden8 devised a method in which diphtheria toxoid was coprecipitated into a matrix of aluminum phosphate, corresponding to the alum precipitation method described earlier. Lewis B. Holt9 demonstrated the following year that preformed aluminum phosphate (prepared from aluminum chloride and trisodium phosphate) acted as an adsorbant and was adjuvant-active with diphtheria toxoid. Aluminum hydroxide has been included into composite adjuvant formulations, such as the AS04 adjuvant formulation proprietary to Glaxo SmithKline, which consists of aluminum hydroxide in combination with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL).",

Besides the apparent Keq, relevant information for the experimentalist is the maximal amount of bound adsorbate Qmax per surface area or weight of particulate material (value at asymptote), which can be used to determine the maximal vaccine dose. Finally, the fitted \u03b8 values give the fraction of sites occupied, which is also valuable information to determine the working concentration of antigen needed to achieve a desired coverage of the adjuvant particles.

Ulanova et al.83 were among the first to carry out systematic studies on the direct effect of aluminum hydroxide in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). They found an increase in the expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules: MHC class II, CD40, CD54 (formerly known as intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or ICAM-1), CD58 (formerly known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 or LFA-3), CD83 (maturation marker), and CD86 (formerly known as B7-2) on the monocytes as well as an increase of mRNA for IL-4. However, in the presence of anti-IL-4 antibody or in highly purified monocyte cultures (i.e., depleted of CD4+ T cells) there was no increase in MHC class II expression. So, apparently, aluminum adjuvant\u2013induced monocyte-derived cytokines stimulated CD4+ T cells to secrete IL-4, which in turn stimulated MHC class II expression on the monocyte surface.",

The changes encountered involved significant upregulation of HLA-DR, as well as CD86 and CD71. Almost 80% of the macrophages obtained were positive for the scavenger receptor CD163. However, incubation with aluminum hydroxide downregulated both Fc\u03b3R and CD163. Macrophages, as they expressed a dendritic cell (DC)\u2013like phenotype after incubation with aluminum hydroxide (HLA-DRhigh, CD86high, and CD14\u2212), were further investigated for the expression of DC\u2013specific markers. The expression of CD83 increased after 15 h of incubation with aluminum hydroxide, compared with non\u2013Al(OH)3-stimulated cells. It turned out that adjuvant-stimulated macrophages were also superior in antigen presentation. Based on these findings, Rimaniol et al. concluded that stimulation with aluminum adjuvant led to differentiation of the macrophages into a form sharing some features with, but still distinctly different from, DCs.",

Upon degradation of calcium phosphate, the two constituents can be reutilized in the normal physiological pathways for Ca++ and PO4- respectively, whereas in contrast to other metallic ions, like Zn++ and Mg++, aluminum apparently does not act as essential trace element or coenzyme in the normal metabolism.

As early as 1 h following intramuscular (IM) injection, radioactive labeled Al could be detected in the blood and it was found that approximately three times more 26Al was excreted from animals vaccinated with aluminum phosphate than those vaccinated with aluminum hydroxide. Assumingly, interstitial fluid containing organic acids with an \u03b1-hydroxy carboxylic acid, able to chelate Al, reacted more readily with aluminum phosphate than with aluminum hydroxide.105 At day 28, the rabbits were euthanized, the main organs were digested using nitric acid, and the radioactivity measured. The relative tissue distribution of radiolabeled Al was: kidney > spleen > liver > heart > lymph node > brain. It is likely that the excretion through blood and urine described earlier primarily involves Al dissolved under the influence of interstitial fluid, whereas the radioactivity detected in lymph nodes and spleen also involved Al adjuvant taken up by APCs. Following injection of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant containing 0.85 mg Al the normal plasma concentration of 30 ng Al/mL only rose by approximately 2 ng Al/mL in Flarend's rabbits. According to the calculation of Flarend, a similar Al dose injected into humans, provided similar clearing kinetics existed, would lead to an estimated increase of serum Al of only 0.04 ng Al/mL, equaling 0.8% above the normal level of approximately 5 ng Al/mL. As the applied dose of 0.85 mg Al corresponds to what is normally used in human vaccines, it seems that the amount of aluminum administered via vaccination does not contribute significantly to the normal exposure to aluminum in humans and serum levels of aluminum.",

The local reaction may be negligible if the inoculum is rapidly dispersed from the injection site. However, if the inoculum resides for a prolonged period at the injection site (as is the case with repository adjuvants like mineral adjuvants or water-in-oil emulsions), then in situ accumulation of phagocytic and immunocompetent cells may in some cases manifest itself as an inflammatory focus accompanied by a transient swelling, local irritation, and redness. Some observations of aluminum-adsorbed vaccines giving rise to more local reactions than unadsorbed vaccines with plain toxoid119 could in part be explained by the plain toxoid vaccine being dispersed from the injection site before a local reaction was established.",

However, MMF was also claimed to be associated with neurological disorders having no obvious etiologic relation to the vaccination.124 However, such correlations are associated with statistical challenges. Due to the very high vaccination coverage in the Western countries, it is expected statistically that patients suffering from a wide range of unrelated diseases would all have been vaccinated with Al-containing vaccines at some point in their medical history.
