On February 19, 2020, we saw 24 a drop in the supply of blood products as COVID-19 prevented blood donation. Thus, we had to stop most of the surgeries for more advanced cancers, resulting in another 75% decrease for such patients(Fig. 1B). This highlights that redistribution of blood products is needed as early as COVID-19 hospitals. Fewer patients aged >70 yr presented for surgery (a decrease of 82% was observed;Fig. 1C).
