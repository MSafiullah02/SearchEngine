In this scenario, oncologic diseases deserve special attention because of their tremendous impact on patients' quality of life and worsening of prognosis, if neglected. For this reason, in northern Italy few hospitals, including the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, have been selected to remain \"COVID-free\". The aim was to preserve the institutional Intensive Care Units from COVID-19, so that oncologic surgeries could proceed unaltered.",

He denies smoking and alcohol habits and is allergic to salicylic acid. He was referred to our Division for a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue border, classified as cT3N0M0 (stage III) according to the 8 th edition of AJCC cancer staging manual 1 . On admission he was afebrile, had no cough and denied contacts with possibly infected and/or contagious people in the previous two weeks. Pre-operative blood tests were unremarkable. He underwent a major surgery: right glossectomy type 3A 2 and en block ipsilateral neck dissection levels I to IV, temporary tracheotomy and reconstruction with left radial forearm free flap. Surgery proceeded uneventfully, except for an increase of rectal temperature (38 to 39\u00b0C) starting 2 hours after the incision and continuing throughout the rest of the procedure. During the following 48 hours, he suffered from persistent fever and isolated episodes of mild hypoxemia, so he underwent a bedside chest X-ray, which showed a suspicious opacity in the right middle lobe. According to the Institutional protocol, a naso-oropharyngeal swab was collected and proved positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was then placed in droplet isolation and treated with antiviral therapy and O 2 support therapy.",
