            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was first detected in 2012 in respiratory specimens of a patient from Saudi Arabia with severe viral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (Zaki et al., 2012). As of 19 June 2015, 1338 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) leading to at least 475 deaths (WHO, 2015). Saudi Arabia is the most affected country with 1030 laboratory confirmed patients. Middle East respiratory syndrome patients have also been reported from Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, United Arab of Emirates (UAE), Iran and Yemen. MERS has been reported from travellers arriving from these countries into Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, UK), Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia), Asia (China, Malaysia, Philippines; Republic of Korea, Thailand) and North America (USA). Some limited secondary transmission has been associated with some travel\u2010associated patients with MERS but one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea led to over 160 human MERS infections (WHO, 2015). Large clusters of human cases have been identified in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and UAE, most of these being associated with human\u2010to\u2010human transmission within healthcare facilities (Assiri et al., 2013; Oboho et al., 2015; WHO, 2015). While some of these case clusters are large, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission remains inefficient and sustained community transmission has not being documented so far (Majumder et al., 2014; WHO, 2015). However, it is relevant to note that the emergence of SARS in 2002 was heralded by repeated self\u2010limited outbreaks of human disease, but that virus finally adapted to transmission in humans, spreading to 25 countries across five continents, infecting approximately 8000 individuals and leading to almost 800 deaths (Peiris et al., 2004). Thus, it is important to understand the ecology and epidemiology of MERS so that zoonotic disease can be prevented and epidemic or pandemic threats mitigated.",

            "text": "In a large countrywide seroepidemiological study of over 10 000 people older than 15 years carried out during 2012\u20132013 in KSA, an overall seroprevalence of 0.15% was detected while 5 of 140 (3.6%) of slaughterhouse workers were seropositive (Muller et al., 2014). The population\u2010based seroprevalence suggests that tens of thousands of MERS\u2010CoV infections have gone unrecognized in Saudi Arabia (Figs 1 and 2). This suggests that some patients with clinically overt MERS who have no obvious exposure to animals may well have acquired infection from such asymptomatic or mild infections, making the identification of true zoonotic infections a challenge. In a study in Qatar, 2% of camel farm workers, 14% of camel barn workers at an international racing track and 2 of 5 camel slaughterhouse workers were seropositive while none of 204 people with no camel contact were seropositive. In this slaughterhouse, virus RNA\u2010positive rate in camels was as high as 60% on some sampling occasions indicating massive levels of human exposure (Reusken et al., 2013b, 2015). In other studies of some human with exposure to camels, there has been no evidence of seropositive to MERS\u2010CoV (Aburizaiza et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2014b). Humans regularly exposed to a dromedary herd known to be infected for at least a month had no clinical or serological evidence of infection (Hemida et al., 2015). In summary, humans with regular and heavy exposure to infected camels do become seropositive but casual exposure to infected camels does not lead to efficient human infection. Even camel abattoir workers who are exposed daily to animals who are regularly shedding MERS\u2010CoV are not uniformly infected and rarely get overt disease. Hardly any of the patients diagnosed with MERS so far are workers in these high\u2010risk occupations. In many respects, the epidemiology of human MERS shares similarities with that of avian influenza A H5N1 where the virus can be ubiquitous in poultry but human disease is stochastic and rare. This highlights the many questions that remain to be understood about the susceptibility and epidemiology of human MERS (Fig. 3). It is possible that unusual routes of exposure or heterogeneity of host susceptibility to MERS\u2010CoV are important determinants of human disease. The possibility of a hitherto unidentified animal host or vector also remains to be more intensively investigated. Nevertheless, given the key role that dromedaries play as a natural host in the ecology of MERS\u2010CoV and the potentially important role that dromedaries may play in zoonotic MERS infection, it is important to review the ecology and animal husbandry of dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula.",

            "text": "The global population of camels is estimated to be approximately 30 million, 95% of these being dromedary camels (reviewed in Gossner et al., 2016). Dromedary camels inhabit the Middle East region, North and East Africa and north\u2010western parts of Asia (Farah, 2001). Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus), on the other hand, are native to the steppes of Central Asia and more adapted to regions with cooler climates. The dromedary and Bactrian camels share a common evolutionary origin with llamas, which originate from South America. Of the total of 28.5 million dromedary camels worldwide, 77% are in Africa, the largest camel populations being found in Somalia (6.2 million), Sudan (4.8 million), Kenya (3 million) and Ethiopia (2.3 million). Only approximately 4% are in the Arabian Peninsula. The highest density of camels by land area or by human population in the Arabian Peninsula is found in Qatar and UAE (Gossner et al., 2016). Table 1 shows the numbers of camels in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. There is a strong positive correlation (r = 0.95, P < 0.001) between the total number of camels and the reported MERS\u2010CoV cases across the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia and UAE which have the largest populations of camels are also the ones with the highest number of confirmed cases of MERS. Although there are differences between the camel census data proposed by FAO and the data from the different Ministries of Agriculture, especially in Saudi Arabia (Table 1), the overall correlation of camel numbers and human MERS remains high.",

            "text": "In the Middle East, dromedary camels are indispensable to the traditional nomadic lifestyle, providing milk, meat, wool, leather, medicinal purposes as well as for transport, trade and racing. Thus, they are an important source of income and social prestige. More recently, camel husbandry in the Middle East has undergone significant changes. For example, the human population in Saudi Arabia has changed from being predominantly (80%) rural in the 1960s to currently being predominantly urbanized (87%) leading to associated changes in patterns of camel husbandry. In Saudi Arabia, six types of camel farms and husbandry have been described; commercial farms, racing farms, use of camels for leisure for urban dwellers (weekend farms), traditional camel farms, camels for renting and camels for prestige (Abdallah and Faye, 2013). More recently, a more detailed typology study of camel husbandry in Saudi Arabia identified the following categories: (i) those who are purely camel farmers, some grazing in the desert with more or less integration into the market systems and with variable levels of application of modern animal management methods; (ii) retired people keeping camels for recreational and other purposes; (iii) camel farmers with good integration to the market and with good health management systems; and (iv) multi\u2010active owners practicing camel rearing as a hobby. There was a distinction between farmers living in the desert together with moving animals as a primary source of livelihood and those living in cities, having camels in peri\u2010urban or sometimes in desert locations but for mainly social satisfaction rather than for economic reasons. Integration to the market for milk and meat drives owners to an increasingly peri\u2010urban setting with improved supplemental diet and better health management (Faye, 2013). Some highly intensive farms are also emerging all over the Arabian Peninsula both for milk production (including milk processing with forms of pasteurized milk) and meat production (feed\u2010lot farms of young male camels (hachi) often imported from the Horn of Africa).",

They move across Saudi Arabia and cross the borders of many Gulf countries including UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar every year during the winter season. For example, the Ministry of Environment in Qatar has banned grazing over their land for 2 years starting 24 August 2011, and this has led to different livestock species from Qatar, especially camels, sheep and goats, crossing into Saudi pasture sites. However, given the lack of official national identification procedures or of obligatory vaccination campaigns focused on camels, it is difficult to quantify the extent of these movements. Camels from both UAE and Qatar travel every year during the winter seasons (November\u2013February) for grazing in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia.",

            "text": "Recently, camel shows called Mazayin al\u2010Ibl (meaning \u2018best of camels\u2019) have been annually held in many Gulf countries. One of the largest camel shows is usually held in November in Um al\u2010Rughaiba in the Eastern Saudi Arabia, a region about 329 km from Riyadh and 160 km from Hafr al Batin city. More than 100 camel herds representing over 160 000 camels from all over the Arabian Peninsula travel every year to participate in this international festival and over than 160 000 people attend this event every year (Harrigan, 2008). Camel movement usually runs parallel to the common highways during their journey from each country or within Saudi Arabia to their destination Um al\u2010Rughaiba, passing cities such as Dhahran and Buraydah (Fig. 4). A major racing and show competition is held annually in February in an area at the suburb of Riyadh called Janadriyah. Other festivals are held in other Gulf countries such as in UAE, the Abu Dhabi Authority of Culture and Heritage (ADACH) international festival in April (Harrigan, 2008). Similar festivals are held annually in other Gulf countries including Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. This is in addition to the local festivals held in each county throughout the year. This regular movement of camels crossing borders of many countries may contribute to the transfer, amplification and evolution of MERS\u2010CoV. For example, previous studies documented high degree of relatedness between MERS\u2010CoV sequences obtained from camel herds in Al\u2010Ahsa and MERS\u2010CoV from humans in UAE and Burydah (Hemida et al., 2014). We speculated that the movement of camels between these locations may spread the virus during their journey. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been detected in camels crossing borders from Saudi Arabia into the UAE (Yusof et al., 2015). These journeys are bidirectional as camel herds actively move between places indicated on the map.",

            "text": "One of the main aspects regarding the camel economy worldwide is the importance of camel regional markets, mainly for providing animals to the meat market. In this context, important flows of live camels are reported from the Horn of Africa (exporting countries are Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Djibouti) to the North of the continent (Egypt, Libya) and to the countries of the Arabia Peninsula (Faye, 2013). These movements could be important in understanding the epidemiology and viral evolution of MERS\u2010CoV. For example in Saudi Arabia, 131 932 camels were officially imported in 2013 representing more than 70% of the animals slaughtered in the Kingdom (Mackay, 2014). This camel trade through importation and exportation may affect the epidemiology of MERS\u2010CoV and the introduction of viruses. The mixing of camels of different origins and immune status to MERS\u2010CoV potentially provides opportunities for amplification and dissemination of MERS\u2010CoV, analogous to what has been described for bovine coronaviruses in cattle where a high percentage of cattle, some of whom are already seropositive, actively shed bovine coronavirus nasally and in faeces shortly after mixing of animals or like in feed\u2010lot cattle infected with BCoV (Saif, 2010). A similar situation also occurs with avian influenza in live poultry markets (Sims and Peiris, 2013). There is anecdotal evidence in camels that prior MERS\u2010CoV seropositivity does not preclude re\u2010infection (Hemida et al., 2014).",

Indeed, some of these camels imported for meat production are fattened within the country of importation for several months before slaughter, providing ample opportunity for interaction with local camel herds and exchange of viruses. Animals imported from some of these countries imported camels proved to be seropositive to MERS\u2010CoV (Perera et al., 2013). Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolated from dromedaries in the abattoirs in Egypt, animals potentially sourced from Sudan or Ethiopia, were phylogenetically diverse (Chu et al., 2014), providing a glimpse of the potential overall diversity of MERS\u2010CoV. Some countries also import animals and then export them to the other neighbouring countries. Camel movements across the Arabian Peninsula and from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula could contribute to or predispose to the introduction and amplification of MERS\u2010CoV and be associated with an increase of human MERS cases. Further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. A detailed, spatiotemporal understanding of camel movement patterns may explain the spread of disease and highlight high\u2010risk areas. Furthermore, studies to genetically and phenotypically characterize the diversity of MERS\u2010CoV in Africa are urgently needed.",

            "text": "In the past few years, seasonal increase of human MERS cases in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia and UAE during winter and early spring has been noted. Camels are seasonal breeders with the male rutting only during the winter months. The gestation period is 12\u201313 months, and thus, calving season is also limited to the winter period and early spring. By providing new na\u00efve hosts into the population in a seasonal manner, this reproductive cycle of dromedary camels could be associated with seasonal patterns of human MERS. The duration of passive maternal antibody and its role in suppressing infection by MERS\u2010CoV remains to be fully defined. In addition, camel movement across the Arabian Peninsula during these times may also contribute to increased human disease. Several viral infections are common during the early life of different animal species such as coronaviruses and rotaviruses. Coronaviruses other than MERS affect newborn animals such as calves, lambs, foals and piglets (Torres\u2010Medina et al., 1985; Dea et al., 1995; Munoz et al., 1996; Davis et al., 2000). The camel calving season usually occurs during the period late October to late February. Our studies and those of others have noted the association of dromedary MERS\u2010CoV infection in camels and the calving season (Hemida et al., 2014; Wernery, 2014). In a follow\u2010up of one camel herd, we detected the initial MERS\u2010CoV infection by RT\u2010PCR as early as late November with the peak of infection at late December, predominantly in calves (Hemida et al., 2014). By the end of February, the infection has been cleared from the herd. A study of a camel herd in Dubai found that virus shedding was more common in calves and that virus shedding in calves was of relatively short duration (Wernery et al., 2015). As calves appear to have the highest risk of MERS\u2010CoV infection, it has been suggested that delayed weaning of calves may reduce the opportunity for humans being exposed to calves.",

The transmission of Hepatitis A virus, rabies virus and foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus to humans through consumption of contaminated cow milk has been reported (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA 1999; Headrick et al., 1998). Some other viruses such as tick\u2010born encephalitis virus can be shed in milk during the active infection (Caini et al., 2012). Despite the potential risk of infection associated with drinking raw camel milk (Mousa et al., 1988), desert nomads in Arabian Peninsula often use raw camel milk as a whole meal for long periods which may last from days to months. They also drink raw milk because of the widespread belief that camel milk has prophylactic and therapeutic properties against many diseases and that boiling the milk destroys its nourishment and medicinal value (Shamsia, 2009). Stability of MERS\u2010CoV (strain Jordan\u2010N3/2012) at different temperatures in camel, cow and goat milk was investigated. The infectivity of MERS\u2010CoV in camel milk was greatly reduced at 22\u00b0C compared to that stored at 4\u00b0C (van Doremalen et al., 2014). It should be noted, however, that this milk was sourced from seronegative camels for MERS\u2010CoV. It is known that MERS\u2010CoV\u2010neutralizing antibody is secreted to camel milk and this may neutralize infectivity of any virus that may be present (Reusken et al., 2014). This study also found evidence of MERS\u2010CoV RNA in samples of camel milk collected by traditional milking practices where the flow of milk (\u2018letting\u2019) is initiated by allowing a calf to suckle the dam. Once the flow of milk is initiated, the herdsman will continue manual milking. As calves are at high risk of acquiring MERS\u2010CoV infection, it is possible that the milk may get contaminated with virus in the nasal secretions or saliva of calves. In the study which reported detection of MERS\u2010CoV RNA in camel milk, it is unknown whether the virus entered milk through contamination from an infected calf or whether the udder was infected via systemic dissemination of the virus through the blood stream. Irrespective of the routes by which the virus can enter the camel milk, the facts support the possibility that raw camel milk could be a source of MERS\u2010CoV infection. Heat treatment or pasteurization may reduce the risk of infection from milk to a minimum (van Doremalen et al., 2014). Further epidemiological studies are needed to investigate the possibility of MERS\u2010CoV shedding in camel milk.",

Both the Saudi Ministry of health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA had reported that eating the raw camel liver caused human bubonic plague in Saudi Arabia in 2005 (Bin Saeed et al., 2005). From the limited data from experimentally infected animals (Adney et al., 2014), it appears unlikely that camel meat and internal organs will have MERS\u2010CoV through virus dissemination through a virema. However, contamination of such organs with respiratory tissues may occur during the process of slaughter, potentially leading to infection via this route. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of these types of meat in MERS\u2010CoV transmission.",

There was one report that a short fragment (around 200 nucleotides) of viral RNA identical to that of MERS\u2010CoV was detected in a Taphozous perforates bat in Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2013). However, this finding remains unconfirmed and this report needs to be regarded with caution.",

However, these findings highlight the possibility that the MERS\u2010CoV precursor may indeed be found in bats. In a recent study, we documented introduction of MERS\u2010CoV into a camel farm which was in a closed compound without much intermingling with other animals. The source of introduction of this virus was unclear (Hemida et al., 2014). Whether another animal host (bats, or other) was responsible for the introduction of the virus remains to be ascertained. Mechanical transmission by feed and manure removal trucks is another possibility.",

However, it is still unclear whether camels are the natural reservoir of the virus and the only source of human infection. Clearly, transmission from camels to humans does take place, and camel exposure is a risk factor for human infection but such transmission is not efficient and infection is not directly proportional to exposure. Heterogeneity of human susceptibility to MERS\u2010CoV infection may be one possible explanation, as also proposed for avian influenza H5N1. Many thousands of people in the Arabian Peninsula appear to have evidence of unrecognized past MERS\u2010CoV infection. On the other hand, many patients with clinically diagnosed MERS do not have an obvious history of direct exposure to camels or their products. This may be because such individuals are being infected from other humans who are infected with MERS unrecognized (asymptomatically or with mild illness). Thus, the true primary zoonotic infections may be difficult to identify. Alternate possibilities of other intermediate or reservoir hosts in the transmission of infection to humans also remains possible, and Fig. 3 illustrates the many \u2018known unknowns\u2019 that remain to be elucidated.",
