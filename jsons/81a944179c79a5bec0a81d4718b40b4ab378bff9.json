If there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, for example in a patient with high-likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension, then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation.

This document will highlight some of the issues facing providers, patients, and the PAH community at-large in real-time as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving. Acknowledging up front that there is a lack of formal guideline consensus and scientific evidence to direct PAH providers and patients on best practices for COVID-19-infected and COVID-affected PAH patients currently, this document is intended to share common clinical scenarios encountered and suggest best clinical practices for caring for patients with PAH (Table 1 ). The impetus for this manuscript was a recent discussion within the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) and their Scientific Leadership Council who expressed a need for guidelines from experts in the field. It should be noted that this document is not meant to be all-inclusive nor to give specific in-hospital management of a PAH patient with COVID-19, as the evidence for such advice is currently lacking, but rather to assist in patient care and management to prevent hospitalization and improve clinical care during this pandemic.",

As with the approach to PAH patients, patients with PH must be evaluated in the context of the severity of their illness. Because there are no specific treatments for patients with PH, specific management strategies for these patients will not be addressed. CTEPH is in a unique position first, because a curative treatment is available in the form of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). However, in the absence of decompensated right heart failure (RHF), how urgently surgery should be performed is an issue that gets raised, especially when PEA is done best in a few select, specialized centers. In this manuscript, the discussions around PAH will also largely apply to CTEPH, with the acknowledgment that it is an area of uncertainty as to when and whether someone should go for PEA during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the anticipated increased needs for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and ventilators, plus the exposure risk associated with being hospitalized at this time.",

This presents a challenge because many healthcare settings have currently gone to emergency status, where elective procedures, including clinic visits, pulmonary function testing, echocardiography, CT scanning, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning, and right heart catheterization (RHC) are being deferred to facilitate staffing of crucial services and to avoid inadvertent exposure. Of note, since the COVID-19 pandemic, some institutions have temporarily moved to computed tomography pulmonary angiogram as first line for the evaluation of CTEPH instead of V/Q scan or less commonly heart catheterization with selective PA angiography. Other centers have elected to temporarily eliminate the ventilation portion of the V/Q study, due to the difficulty in disinfecting the ventilation systems. 4 If lung perfusion images show no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, then one can rule out CTEPH and avoid more invasive imaging in the catheterization lab.",

In this setting, PAH-providers may be able to work with companies for insurance provisional approval, during urgent or emergent initiation of therapy. The value of performing an elective RHC in patients with a high likelihood of Group 2 or Group 3 PH, where the benefit of PAH therapies has not been established, 6 is discouraged unless the patient is severely ill, and it will change management. However, in such a case, that would not be elective. Additionally, for stable patients with high likelihood of having Group 2 and 3 PH, elective new patient evaluation should be deferred until a later date due to the lack of established therapies for these disease states at the moment. The COVID-19 pandemic is an opportune time to use risk likelihood tools on who would benefit from undergoing a RHC, 7 and perhaps patients without RHF or those at lower risk of actually having PAH can have their RHC (and treatment) deferred in the short run.",

This practice, although only consensus based, was developed because of the fragile nature of PAH patients and the lack of predictability for response to treatment, and the ongoing risk for disease progression in prevalent cases. Since patients can rapidly clinically deteriorate, PAH-specific risk scores advocate frequent follow-up to allow for a formal risk assessment during this time period as well. However, given the potential risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection by coming to a healthcare setting, patients with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease are being advised against non-essential travel and to practice social distancing. Thus, a risk/benefit analysis evaluating the need for in-person versus remote clinic visits, as well as the need for certain diagnostic tests, is in order in the current healthcare environment.",

Many PAH programs have already introduced telehealth programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where patients' current health status is evaluated by telephone or video conferencing. Although there are limitations to telehealth, such as inability to do comprehensive physical exams and essential diagnostic testing, it is likely that many patients are capable of self-description of their PAH signs and symptoms and thus can guide their management. Additional limitations to telehealth include an inability to reliably measure vital signs, as well as patient accessibility to access audio and/or video conferencing technology and familiarity with these technologies, especially for patients with limited means. As telehealth evolves, new questions about delivery of care will certainly emerge which will need to be measured against doing what is best for the overall safety and well-being of the patient.",

With the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider the additive value of these sometimes comprehensive tests in the context of the risks associated with visiting the hospital or clinic to obtain them. While laboratory values for N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are often used as a surrogate for RHF in patients with PAH, there are risks for patients traveling to a laboratory to obtain these tests. In patients who are on anticoagulation for CTEPH, atrial fibrillation, pump infusion, or other reasons, it may be worth considering transitioning to direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight heparin to avoid the laboratory visit necessary to obtain and monitor a therapeutic International Normalised Ratio (INR) with warfarin use. Similar to procedures which will be limited during this time, such as echocardiogram, it is worth reconsidering whether any of the tests performed for routine follow-up change clinical management sufficiently to warrant the risk of getting the test performed.",

Frequentlyreported symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 infection include fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, and shortness of breath (3-31%) at illness onset.

Systemic blood pressure should be maintained with systemic vasopressors, although the preferred agent is not well-defined. 21 Despite a high likelihood for COVID-19, in a febrile PAH patient, consideration should be given to start empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics at the onset of fever and worsening respiratory symptoms due to the risk of bacterial infection or superinfection being a contributing factor.",

In general, PAH-specific therapies should be continued during hospitalization and patients unable to tolerate oral or inhaled medications may need to be transitioned from oral to intravenous medications to get through severity of a COVID-19 infection. 22 It is important to consider nitric oxide (NO) during clinical decompensation in lieu of agents that have the potential to lower blood pressure (for example, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, guanylate cyclase stimulators). We have experience of delivering NO at home during this pandemic, although this is unlikely to be readily available in the near-term. 23 Although ECMO is used in some COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia, in the cases that we have seen to date involving PAH, this modality is particularly challenging and decisions about utilizing this resource-intensive option during a pandemic have to be closely scrutinized, especially in the absence of bridging to transplantation during these difficult times. 8, 11, 24 Society finds itself in an unenviable position and increasingly will have to make difficult decisions about health care delivery and resource utilization, including the use of precious and intensive interventions such as invasive ventilation and ECMO. In particular, PAH patients will have great difficulty surviving these types of interventions which poses a significant opportunity cost during a pandemic that is stretching the health care system. It is anticipated that there will be shortages of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic, which poses even further concern for their utility in this population. As a general recommendation, practitioners should consider utilizing an established PAH-specific risk assessment tool to help identify patients who are more likely to survive heroic interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, patients with a REVEAL 2.0 risk score 9 or those meeting at least 3 of 4 (invasive method) or at least 2 of 3 (non-invasive method) LOW risk criteria per the French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry risk tool, have significantly better prognosis with their PAH and make more suitable candidates for riskier acute interventions during the COVID-19 crisis. 25, 26 Considerations for specialized PH centers and regional PH programs Specialized PH centers provide crucial service for the care of PAH patients over broad areas. 27, 28 However, with travel restrictions, it may be difficult for PAH patients to travel to these centers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these centers will likely need to increase their use of remote collaboration with regional programs and community providers in order to provide advice and suggestions regarding best practice. It will be important for specialty pharmacies that provide access to many PAH-specific therapies to work with industry to ensure seamless distribution of therapies during this crisis.",

Trials to evaluate safety of agents should be halted, and trials that involve immunosuppressive agents should be re-evaluated for risk versus benefit during the COVID-19 pandemic.
