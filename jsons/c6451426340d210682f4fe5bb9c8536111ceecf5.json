All participants approved 62 an electronic informed consent. 63 Participants completed a 12-item questionnaire that included questions assessing 64 the participants' demographics and present and previous sexual behaviors. The 65 following data were obtained using a self-constructed, study-specific instrument: age, 66 ethnicity, education, profession, current financial situation, sexual orientation, sexually transmitted disease status, self and partner medical and surgical history, 68 partner relationship, living together with parents or not, changes in the number of 69 sexual partners, sexual desire, frequency of sexual behavior, sexual satisfaction, and 70 risky sexual behaviors.
