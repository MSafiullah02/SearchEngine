He presented to emergency with symptom of 3 weeks duration, characterized by extreme anxiety, restless, fidgety, sleep disturbances and worries that every family member including he will die due to COVID-19 infection. These symptoms increased further after the lockdown. Symptoms would worsen on following the news channels, especially seeing the images of hospitals and pictures of sick people; and reading news about COVID-19. Started remaining preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19, distanced himself from others, would pressurize family members to buy masks and started hoarding them. He would consider himself vulnerable for infection and resultant death. Despite being reassured by family members that they are taking precautions and he is safe, he would not feel reassured. He would not allow any family member to go out of the house with the fear that he/she might get infected, bring infection to home, and he will get infected by the same, and ultimately die. Over the period of next 2 weeks developed syndromal depression, which led to emergency visit. His mental status examination revealed that he had excessive worry of getting infected with COVID-19, spreading the infection to others and hence would be blamed by the society, had ideas of worthlessness, catastrophe, and helplessness. Additionally he had sadness of mood. His routine investigations and physical examination did not reveal any abnormality. Tab. Escitalopram was increased to 20 mg/day along with prescription of Tab clonazepam 0.25 mg thrice a day. Supportive psychotherapy sessions were started and he is being followed up. Over the period of next 1 week he started showing improvement in symptoms.",

Exploration of history revealed that she has been living alone and was maintaining well without any antidepressants. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19 infection, she started following the news of COVID-19, and started remaining worried about contracting COVID-19 infection. As she was living alone, started remaining worried that there is no one to take care of her, if she develops COVID. In view of apprehension of developing COVID-19 infection, initially, her self-care increased, she started washing clothes repeatedly, bathing frequently and frequently changing bed sheets. She would do so, as she would feel that these are contaminated and she would get infected with COVID-19 infection. Gradually, over the next 3 weeks, her anxiety related to COVID-19 infection increased, and she developed depressive symptoms in the form of sadness of mood, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disturbances, decreased appetite, self absorbed behavior, poor interaction, fearfulness, and delusion of persecution. She was brought to emergency in view of depressive and psychotic symptoms. She was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe depression with psychotic symptoms.

Both the cases, availability of excessive information about COVID-19 in the media, especially about the consequences of the infection for the elderly led to development of initial anxiety. As the anxiety symptoms, increased, both the patients, who were otherwise maintaining well, developed relapse of symptoms. Other factors, which possibly contributed to relapse of symptoms in the second case, was the fact that the person was staying alone. This person was maintaining well, prior to the lockdown; however, lockdown possibly led to marked social isolation, which increased her sense of vulnerability.",

Accordingly, there is a need for the media, to be more sensitive to the needs of the elderly and promote preventive statergies, but under the garb of promoting prevention, they should not create a scare of the elderly.
