The incubation period is generally 3\u20137 days, the longest not more than 14 days. Fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main symptoms. A few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, and diarrhea. In severe cases, dyspnea occurs more than a week later. In severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction develop rapidly [4]. The confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection requires viral nucleic acid detection in throat swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, or blood, and the specificity is strong but the sensitivity is poor [5]. According to current experience, lung imaging manifests earlier than clinical symptoms, so imaging examination is vital in preclinical screening. Currently, high-resolution CT (HRCT) is of outstanding importance as it is the main tool for screening, primary diagnosis, and evaluation of disease severity.",

In our study, patients may have a single lobe or multiple lobes involvement; 30.2% of patients had only one lobe involved, and 44.4% had all lobes involvement. This study shows that the most common manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are patchy/punctate ground glass opacities (85.7%), patchy consolidation (19.0%), and mainly distributed in a sub-pleural area (Fig. 1c\u2013f); chest CT of the patients for re-examination after 3\u201314 days were also observed. It was found that, as the disease progressed, the range of ground glass density patches and consolidation increased (Fig. 2a1, a2), which were mainly distributed in the middle and outer zones of the lung. When patients' condition would improve, a little fibrous stripe may appear. Conversely, when patients' condition worsened, the lungs showed diffuse lesions, and the density of both lungs increased widely, showing a \"white lung\" appearance, which seriously affects the patient's lung function. It is worth noting that only a single GGO can be seen in some patients at an early stage, and the range significantly increases in the short-term re-examination (Fig. 2a1, a2). In some patients, even if only few fibrous stripes are seen at an early stage, consolidation can develop in the short-term reexamination (Fig. 2b1, b2). In some patients with irregular solid nodules of varying sizes at the early stage, re-examination CT showed that the nodules increased, enlarged, and merged; the density of some solid nodules is reduced, showing a ground glass density, like \u201cmelting sugar\u201d (Fig. 2c1\u2013d2).",
