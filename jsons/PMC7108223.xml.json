The genome of the JE virus is composed of a positive single-stranded RNA of approximately \u223c10,000 bases in length.2 Infection rates of JE virus in epidemic regions usually vary, ranging from a few cases to 20% of the population.3 Clinically, at least 50,000 cases and 10,000 deaths occur each year, mostly among children in Asia,4 in spite of mass vaccinations which have been implemented in many endemic countries.5\n",

Neither is it possible to isolate the JE virus from peripheral blood because of the short period and low level of transient viremia even in the acute stage of the disease.6 Nowadays, the laboratory serodiagnosis of JE uses a versatile and convenient approach to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).7, 8 More recently, molecular techniques, e.g., the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), to amplify gene fragments of viral RNAs are increasingly being used to make diagnoses.9, 10 Nevertheless, the low copy number of viral RNA in the blood of JE patients makes it difficult to extract RNA from this source.11 Utilization of the RT-PCR to detect viral RNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), also called in situ RT-PCR, was thus developed as a molecular tool which does not require messenger (m)RNA extraction. The technique has been applied to diagnosing JE virus infection in PBMCs in a mouse model.11\n",

In past years, virus isolation from nerve tissues and antibody (IgM and IgG) detection from serum and/or CSF have extensively been used to detect JE virus in most laboratories.

It was noted that the JE virus can persist in mice for 4\u201316 weeks following intraperitoneal inoculation and may later be reactivated.39 In addition, the JE virus is also reported to persist in the nervous system of some patients.40 As a matter of fact, flaviviruses including the JE virus and other flaviviruses have been identified to exist in PBMCs of convalescent blood samples, indicating the possibility of persistent viral infection in leukocytes.41 Moreover, JE viral RNA fragment has ever been amplified from white blood cells during the acute phase of infection.42 This suggests that detection of such viruses in leukocytes may help make a diagnosis even though the blood was collected in the acute viremia stage. In order to achieve this goal, we herein established a technique called in situ RT-LAMP, which was successfully applied to detect JE virus in both cultured cells and PBMCs isolated from infected mice.",

Furthermore, one advantage is that the experiment can be run at a constant temperature. Thus there is no need for a thermocycler that is necessary when running this technique with a conventional RT-PCR. Although in situ RT-PCR can actually skip the process of RNA extraction, it still needs an expensive instrument, a thermocycler. In other words, in situ RT-LAMP actually is more convenient than both in situ RT-PCR and LAMP.",

However, no satisfactory signal was shown either in gel electrophoresis or on blotted NC membranes in the experiment using infected BHK-21 cells. This suggested that the large size of DIG molecules labeled on the outer primer FIP probably interrupted their binding to stem-loop DNA. Thus we shifted the DIG-labeling to dCTP. It turns out that the amplification of nucleic acids was successfully detected; it could clearly be differentiated from that in the control group (mock-infection). This indicated that Dig-labeling of dCTP is relatively efficient, compared to primer labeling, and is much more efficient, resulting in better visualization and easier differentiation from negative results. In addition to detecting the JE virus in cultured BHK-21 cells, the technique was also applied to detect the virus in PBMCs isolated from whole blood of infected mice. Eventually, the virus was detected at 1, 3, and 5 d post-inoculation, consistent with our previous work using in situ RT-PCR.11 Nearly half of the inoculated mice dying of the disease (data not shown) suggested that most infected PBMCs may have migrated into brain tissues.43\n",

It is particularly useful to detect viruses in blood samples, usually the genomic copy number is low,42 collected at the acute stage or which are persistently infected.
