RIG-I and MDA5 further harbor two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which are responsible for downstream signaling.

RIG-I senses RNAs possessing both panhandle structures and a 5\u2032triphosphate moiety, while MDA5 is thought to recognize long dsRNA or web-like RNA aggregates (reviewed in [3]). In addition, a recent study indicated that a 5\u2032diphosphate moiety in the viral RNA can also be recognized by RIG-I [4]. Extensive functional studies have demonstrated the importance of RIG-I and MDA5 in sensing RNA virus infections, with RIG-I playing a critical role in the detection of orthomyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses and arenaviruses, and MDA5 preferentially detecting picornaviruses. Moreover, many viruses (flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, reoviruses) are sensed by both RIG-I and MDA5 [5]. Upon RNA ligand binding, RIG-I and MDA5 bind to their common adaptor MAVS/Cardif/IPS-1/VISA through CARD\u2013CARD interactions. This leads, via TRAF3 or TRAF6, to the activation of several well-studied kinases of the IKK family, namely IKK\u025b and TBK1 as well as IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3. Through phosphorylation steps, these kinases ultimately activate the transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3/7), NF-\u03baB, and ATF2/c-Jun, which then induce the transcription of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines (reviewed in [6]). Subsequently, secreted IFNs bind to their respective receptors and induce the expression of hundreds of ISGs, leading to an antiviral state.",

            "text": "In the past several years, it has become evident that the activation of RIG-I and MDA5 is a multi-step process consisting of viral RNA binding, conformational changes, and a series of PTMs. Furthermore, regulatory PTMs ensure that aberrant RLR signal transduction does not occur in the absence of a viral infection (Figure 1\n). In uninfected cells, RIG-I is kept in an auto-repressed state due to the masking of its CARDs by the helicase domain [7]. To prevent aberrant downstream signaling, RIG-I and MDA5 also undergo phosphorylation at multiple residues: S8 and T170 as well as T770 and S854/S855 in the RIG-I CARDs and CTD, respectively; and S88 in the MDA5 CARDs [8]. RIG-I is kept phosphorylated at these CARD and CTD sites by protein kinase C \u03b1/\u03b2 (PKC\u03b1/\u03b2) and casein kinase II (CKII), respectively, while the kinase(s) for MDA5 phosphorylation is still unknown [9, 10]. An RNAi screen against the human phosphatome recently revealed that two highly homologous isoenzymes of phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1\u03b1 and PP1\u03b3) are responsible for RIG-I and MDA5 dephosphorylation, thereby triggering their activation [11\u2022]. In response to viral RNA binding, PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 binds and dephosphorylates both RIG-I (S8 and T170) and MDA5 (S88) in the CARDs, allowing for MAVS binding, likely through a rearrangement of the tandem CARD after dephosphorylation. The phosphatase(s) for the removal of the phosphorylation marks in the RIG-I CTD is currently unknown. As PP1\u03b1 and PP1\u03b3 dephosphorylate numerous substrates in the cell, current studies are focused on elucidating the mechanism of PP1's substrate specificity towards RLRs in infected cells.",

            "text": "Recent data demonstrated that, in the case of RIG-I, there is crosstalk between phosphorylation and K63-linked ubiquitination, a polyubiquitin linkage that does not trigger proteasomal degradation but facilities signal transduction events. Biochemical studies demonstrated that in uninfected cells, RIG-I is robustly phosphorylated but minimally ubiquitinated in its CARDs and CTD. However, upon stimulation of RIG-I by viral RNA binding, dephosphorylation occurs, and this triggers robust K63-ubiquitination of RIG-I by two critical ubiquitin E3 ligases, TRIM25 and Riplet. Mechanistically, Riplet first induces K63-linked ubiquitination of K788 in the CTD of RIG-I [12]. This appears to trigger a conformational change that exposes the CARDs, enabling TRIM25 to bind and to attach K63-linked ubiquitin chains to K172 in RIG-I CARD2, ultimately leading to RIG-I oligomerization and MAVS binding [13]. K63-linked ubiquitination of CARD2 by TRIM25 is critical for RIG-I activation, as loss of TRIM25 severely hampers RIG-I signaling. Furthermore, K63-linked ubiquitin chains have also been shown to bind to the CARDs non-covalently to promote RIG-I oligomerization and activation [14]. Thus, it has been unclear for quite some time how both covalent and non-covalent K63-polyubiquitin mediate RIG-I activation. This question was recently addressed by structural analysis of the RIG-I CARDs, which showed that the CARDs form a helical tetramer adopting a \u2018lock-washer configuration\u2019, in which three K63-diubiquitins are wrapped around the outer rim of the CARD tetramer [15\u2022\u2022]. This study further showed that K172 is within the covalent linkage distance to ubiquitin (<20 \u00c5), strongly indicating that this residue is indeed covalently ubiquitinated. Biochemical studies comparing the activation capacity of covalent versus non-covalent K63-diubiquitin showed that, while both induced RIG-I tetramerization and MAVS activation, covalent K63-diubiquitin had a stronger RIG-I activation capacity than unanchored K63-diubiquitin [15\u2022\u2022]. It has been recently shown that RIG-I can also be activated in a ubiquitin-independent manner. Specifically, the IFN-inducible oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) protein, which contains two ubiquitin-like domains, binds to RIG-I and mimics K63-linked polyubiquitin, thereby enhancing RIG-I activation [16\u2022]. This study proposed a model in which TRIM25 and Riplet-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination is essential for RIG-I activation early during infection, while OASL activates RIG-I at later time points.",

            "text": "The importance of K63-linked ubiquitination for RIG-I activation was further strengthened by the identification of several deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that remove this ubiquitin mark from RIG-I to inhibit its signaling. CYLD (cylindromatosis) deubiquitinates RIG-I and several downstream molecules to prevent premature RIG-I activation in uninfected cells [17], while USP3 deubiquitinates RIG-I specifically after viral infection, likely serving as a negative feedback regulator [18]. In contrast, USP21 has been shown to bind and deubiquitinate RIG-I independent of viral infection [19]. Together, these studies establish K63-linked ubiquitination as a crucial activation mark for RIG-I. In contrast, the role of K63-linked ubiquitin polymers in MDA5 activation is still a subject of debate. In general, our knowledge of PTMs that regulate the signaling activity of MDA5 lags significantly. As described above, dephosphorylation by PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 has been shown to be critical for MDA5 activation [11\u2022]. In addition, SUMOylation of the MDA5 CTD by the E3 ligase PIAS2\u03b2 facilitates MDA5-mediated antiviral signaling; however, the precise mechanism of this activation mode remains unknown [20].",

The RING-finger protein 125 (RNF125) induces K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RIG-I, MDA5 and MAVS, thereby preventing excessive RLR signaling [21]. Conversely, USP4 stabilizes RIG-I by removing K48-linked ubiquitination [22]. The stability of TRIM25 is tightly regulated by K48-linked ubiquitination mediated by the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of the two E3 ligases HOIL-1L and HOIP [23]. Conversely, USP15 has been recently identified as a DUB enzyme that stabilizes TRIM25, thereby ensuring effective viral clearance through sustained IFN-\u03b2 production [24]. The abundance of MAVS is also delicately controlled by degradative K48-linked ubiquitination mediated by the E3 ligases AIP4 (also called ITCH), Smurf1 (SMAD ubiquitin regulatory factor 1), and RNF5 [25, 26, 27]. However, it is currently unknown how MAVS stability is dynamically regulated by these three E3 ligases, and whether they act in a temporal or cell type-specific manner.",

A splice variant of RIG-I (RIG-I SV) is specifically induced upon viral infection or IFN stimulation [28]. RIG-I SV carries a short deletion (amino acids 36\u201380) in CARD1 and is therefore unable to bind TRIM25 for downstream activation. RIG-I SV suppresses antiviral signaling in a dominant-negative manner by hetero-oligomerizing with full-length RIG-I, which prevents MAVS binding. Similarly, a splice variant of MAVS (MAVS1a) strongly binds to RIG-I and inhibits its interaction with full-length MAVS for signal transduction [29]. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that the MAVS mRNA is bicistronic, and that alternative translation gives rise to a smaller MAVS protein termed \u2018miniMAVS\u2019 [30\u2022\u2022]. MiniMAVS dampens IFN induction, but its ability to promote cell death is comparable to that of full-length MAVS. The precise mechanism of how miniMAVS acts, however, is unknown.",

VSV infection also induces the expression of miR-146a in macrophages in a RIG-I-dependent manner. MiR-146a then acts as a negative-feedback regulator of the RLR pathway by targeting several important downstream signaling molecules, including TRAF6 [32].

Given the importance of RLRs for an effective innate immune response, viral pathogens have evolved means to manipulate various RLR regulatory mechanisms for immune evasion (Figure 2\n). Many viruses have been shown to dysregulate the PTMs of RLRs. For example, measles and Nipah viruses, both members of the paramyxovirus family, antagonize the phosphatases PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 to prevent RLR dephosphorylation and hence activation. Mechanistically, their V protein, a well-known IFN antagonist, interacts with PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 and sequesters these phosphatases away from MDA5, thereby keeping it in the CARD-phosphorylated, inactive state [44]. Furthermore, in dendritic cells, measles virus targets PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 through a V-independent mechanism by inducing DC-SIGN signaling and formation of a negative-regulatory PP1 complex, inhibiting both RIG-I and MDA5 [45]. Previously, multiple studies have demonstrated that the V proteins of several paramyxoviruses, including parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), antagonize MDA5 through a direct interaction with its helicase domain, thereby blocking its ATPase activity [46, 47\u2022]. VP35 of Ebola virus (EboV) and NS1 of influenza A virus (IAV) specifically inhibit the ATPase activity of RIG-I that is stimulated by PACT (PKR activator) [48, 49].",

For example, poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) use their 3C proteases to prevent the formation of RLR-containing avSGs through cleavage of the Ras-Gap SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) [57, 58]. Other proteins sequester RLRs from MAVS. The M protein of SARS-CoV, the Z protein of New World (NW) arenaviruses, and the glycoprotein G of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) bind to RIG-I to sequester it from MAVS. Furthermore, the N protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) binds specifically to MDA5, relocalizing it to large inclusion bodies [59, 60, 61, 62]. In addition, the NSs protein of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) has been recently shown to interact with RIG-I, TRIM25 and TBK1 and to relocalize them into cytoplasmic endosome-like structures for sequestration [63]. Moreover, PB1-F2 of IAV reduces the inner membrane potential of mitochondria, leading to fragmentation of these organelles and inhibition of innate immune signaling [64, 65\u2022].",

Measles virus infection triggers selective autophagy to degrade mitochondria (a process termed \u2018mitophagy\u2019), resulting in decreased MAVS abundance and disruption of RLR signaling [68]. Finally, the NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV have been recently shown to trigger the degradation of RIG-I, IRF3 and many other molecules in the IFN induction pathway by assembling a large degradative complex on the mitochondria [69].",

Upon engagement of viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change and is dephosphorylated by PP1\u03b1/\u03b3. Subsequently, activation of RIG-I is mediated by K63-linked ubiquitination of the CTD and CARD domains by Riplet and TRIM25, respectively, promoting RIG-I tetramerization. OASL can mimic K63-linked ubiquitination to promote RIG-I activation. The adaptor protein 14-3-3\u025b mediates translocation of the active RIG-I-TRIM25 complex to mitochondrion/MAM-localized MAVS, leading to downstream signal transduction that results in type I IFN gene expression (not illustrated). The deubiquitinating enzymes CYLD, USP21 and USP3 remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I as a form of homeostatic regulation to prevent aberrant IFN induction. The expression of CYLD is suppressed by miR-526a. TRIM25, RIG-I and MAVS are further regulated by degradative K48-linked ubiquitination mediated by LUBAC, RNF125, and AIP4, Smurf1, and RNF5, respectively. Conversely, USP15 and USP4 deubiquitinate TRIM25 and RIG-I, respectively, to stabilize the proteins. The Atg5\u2013Atg12 conjugate and Sec14L1 block RIG-I\u2013MAVS interaction to prevent antiviral signaling. A RIG-I splice variant (RIG-I SV), MAVS splice variant (MAVS1a) and miniMAVS also contribute to prevent excessive signaling.",
