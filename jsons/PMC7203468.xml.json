According to the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, ISS), 102,669 individuals had tested positive as of April 1, of whom 11.5% (i.e., 11,857 individuals) had already died. Based on data updated to March 30, 2020, the ISS described the demographics and clinical characteristics of 10,026 deceased patients in Italy who were positive for COVID-19. The geographical distribution of deaths showed Lombardy as the leading region in death since the beginning of the epidemic. The average age of the deceased COVID-19-positive patients is 79.4 years (median 80.0, Inter Quartile Range\u2014IQR 75.0\u201385.8); 3,088 were women (30.8%). As regards the number of deaths by age group, the median age of COVID-19-positive deceased patients was ~15 years higher than the median of all patients who contracted the infection (median age of patients who died: 80 years; infected patients: 65 years) (Figure 1A). Women who died after contracting COVID-19 infection were older than men (median ages: women 84, men 79), and lethality markedly increased after the age of 70.8 years (Figure 1B). Information with regard to pre-existing conditions was also available among a subgroup of 909 deceased patients. The average number of observed comorbidities in this population was 2.7, with 51% having three or more pre-existing conditions (Table 1). Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer were among the most frequently described conditions already present in deceased patients at the time of COVID-19 infection (5). A multivariate analysis to attribute the right weights to the effects of chronic diseases and advanced age is not yet available. In this regard, the role of well-known risk factors (e.g., smoking) for the occurrence of chronic conditions should also be considered. In addition, significant data on cancer characteristics, including type of cancer, stage, and ongoing treatment, of deceased COVID-19 patients are lacking. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) has already implemented specific national and international multicenter investigations (e.g., the AIOM-LCORONA study).",

            "text": "The Italian demographic and epidemiological scenario is characterized by one of the highest aging indices in the world, with well-established corresponding public health programs for the geriatric population and associated chronic diseases. Accordingly, in the last few decades, the Italian medical-scientific community has developed a strong sensibility for and attention to elderly people and geriatric medicine. In the oncology field, the elderly and aging-related problems have been a clear focus of the Italian Group for Geriatric Oncology (GIOGER) since the late'90s (6, 7). Since then, Italian oncologists have been promoting clinical research focused on cancer in the elderly and also a strenuous promotion campaign against any form of ageism. Similarly, the Italian Association of Medical Oncologists (AIOM) annually publishes recommendations and guidelines for the management of elderly cancer patients (8). As a consequence, in the extraordinary emerging scenario where older persons with cancer are at dual risk (age and immunosuppressive therapy) and are the group most vulnerable to being severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we face an emergency that involves not only healthcare and economics but also cultural and ethical aspects. In fact, from the organizational health perspective, the Italian government adopted extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission and to allocate resources to medical and intensive care units. From their side, Italian oncologists have taken rapid actions to update their care programs in view of the new emerging requirements. In consideration of the need to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in elderly cancer patients, to guarantee the best continuity of care, and to contain the transmission of infected cases among patients, practical suggestions have been envisaged. They include promoting telemedicine, limiting turnover of patients, relatives, and caregivers, and providing tools and novel therapeutic strategies. Given that the continuity and timeliness of antineoplastic treatments must be guaranteed, even greater attention must be paid to the assessments that are already routinely performed in oncology, considering case by case the assessment of treatment options based on the biological characteristics of the tumor, the clinical picture, and the novel potential health risks from COVID-19 infection (9). The recommended measures are essentially aimed to: (1) favor as much as possible the social distancing of elderly cancer patients, and limit their attendance and stationing in hospitals where the risk of infection is high; (2) reduce immunodeficiency and iatrogenic treatment-related events that increase the risk of serious infection and require the consumption of medical resources. For disease-free elderly cancer patients, it is considered appropriate to postpone the follow-up (e.g., at 6\u201312 months), providing telephone and/or telematic triage. For disease-active patients on oral agent-treatment, it is advisable to assess clinical needs and evaluate laboratory tests by telematic triage. Moreover, according to the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA), it is now possible to extend the drug refill time. For patients with active disease receiving intravenous agents, regimens with a longer interval (e.g., 4 weeks) should be employed, while weekly regimens should be avoided when possible; in a curative and adjuvant setting, it is advisable to consider prophylactic use of growth factors for agents at high risk of myelosuppression, minimizing, if possible, the number of cycles of chemotherapy or the prolonging cycle length; when multiple treatment choices are available, oral targeted therapy rather than intravenous agents (chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors) may be attractive, as it requires less healthcare interaction and medical resources; for patients affected by resectable cancer, perioperative chemotherapy with high risks of neutropenia should be avoided. Regarding caregivers, in order to avoid overcrowding in waiting rooms, in the chemotherapy area, and in parking areas and in order to guarantee safe social distancing, accompanying persons are not allowed except in situations expressly authorized. For inpatients, the presence of a single companion may be provided and for a limited time (Figure 2).",
