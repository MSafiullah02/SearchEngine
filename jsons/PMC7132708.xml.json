Therefore, we suggest a follow-up study using observation to ensure objectivity in regard to adherence to SP. In addition, since general and tertiary hospitals were selected using convenience sampling, a selection of hospitals via systematic allocation considering the area and facility size would be necessary. Furthermore, male nurses only accounted for 3.9% of the sample, which is insufficient given that the average ratio of male nurses in South Korea is 10%. Last, this study focused on South Korea, whose circumstances are rather particular with respect to the national outbreak of MERS in 2015; and therefore, its results should be interpreted with caution.",

In a hierarchical analysis, the sociodemographic (model 1), individual (model 2), and institutional (model 3) factors, with significant influence on adherence to SP, were found to be hospital type, attitude, and safety climate and administrative support, respectively. Attitude was the biggest influencer of adherence to SP, followed by administrative support, hospital types, and safety climate. Adherence to SP by nurses will improve if safe environments are created in different hospital types, and if managerial support and administrative efforts are sustained. To change the attitude of nurses toward SP, consistent promotion and a reward system should be put into place, along with practical training applicable to clinical practice. Special care should be put into small and medium-sized hospitals, which are more likely to be overlooked when it comes to infection control, and institutional efforts should be made to secure adequate staff, physical safety environment, and nursing time required for creating safety climate. Hospital administrators should take responsibility as role models and demonstrate consistent adherence to SP with determination and commitment.",
