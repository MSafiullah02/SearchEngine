Previous work relies on costly human-annotated data or question-title pairs. In this work, we propose a distant supervision framework that can train a question summarizer without annotation costs or question-title pairs, where sentences are automatically annotated by means of heuristic rules. The key idea is that a single-sentence question tends to have a summary-like property. We empirically show that our models trained on the framework perform competitively with respect to supervised models without the requirement of a costly human-annotated dataset.",

            "text": "People ask questions in various scenarios such as community question answering (CQA) sites, conference sessions, and e-mail conversations. However, questions tend to be lengthy and laborious to understand because they often contain peripheral information. Question summarization is the task of transforming such questions into shorter and concise ones. We focus on the setting used in existing studies that transforms an input question into a concise single-sentence summary [7, 12, 21] . This setting can be regarded as title or headline generation, and is particularly important for practical application on CQA sites where questions do not always have appropriate titles, unlike news articles. In fact, to reduce the burden on users who post questions, many CQA sites (including the biggest Japanese CQA site, Yahoo! Chiebukuro [23] ), do not provide an input field for titles in the submission form to reduce the burden on users who post questions.On most CQA sites, the first sentence of a question is displayed as the headline, but this is not always appropriate. We show these examples in Table 1 . There are two approaches for summarization tasks: extractive and abstractive. The extractive approach selects salient units (e.g., sentences) in the input [3, 8, 13, 15, 16, 20] , while the abstractive approach generates a summary by possibly paraphrasing the information in the input [2, 22] . The extractive approach has an advantage in that it does not generate errors when extracting one sentence for title generation and can be directly used for real services, as reported by Higurashi et al. [7] . Therefore, we take the extractive approach assuming that extracted titles will be used for a real service.",

Various approaches for different tasks have been proposed, such as the use of FreeBase [1] for relation extraction, emoticons for sentiment classification [6] , and topic labels on Wikipedia articles for blog topic classification [10] . In the summarization field, Nallapati et al. [18] and Chen and Lapata [3] automatically annotated labels for sentence extraction by using a dataset with human-generated abstractive summaries.

Chiebukuro are single-sentence questions. For negative instances, only a few long multi-sentence questions exist, but the number of sentences in the questions is large. In Step 2, we can use any classifier even with a large number of parameters thanks to the availability of large-scale data. In our experiments, we examine neural network and logistic regression classifiers. In Step 3, we prepare three selection strategies: Greedy, Init, and Q. Greedy selects the sentence with the highest confidence score, whereas Init selects the initial sentence among sentences with reasonably high confidence scores, which is expected to be effective for multi-focused questions. Q first extracts question sentences by means of a rule-based approach and then selects the sentence with the highest score among the extracted question sentences. We will explain these steps (i.e., how to create the pseudo data, the training settings of the classifiers, and the algorithms for the selection strategies) in more detail in the next section.",
