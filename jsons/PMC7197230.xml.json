Conversely, and perhaps as importantly, it will have a great impact on understanding the causative genes underlying human autosomal recessive conditions.",

Reads were mapped to the reference human genome (hg19) using Burrows\u2013Wheeler Aligner 0.7.8. The number of uniquely mapped reads ranged from 48 million to 108 million. The mean coverage at each target base varied from 54x to 139\u00d7, with a minimum of 80% of the bases covered by at least 30 reads in all the patients. SAMtools v 0.1.19 was used to sort and merge the data. Indel containing reads were realigned using RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner of GATK 3.4.46. Variants were called using HaplotypeCaller, LeftAlignAndTrimVariants, and GenotypeGVCFs of GATK 3.5. Variants were annotated with ANNOVAR (version 2015) including for dbSNP (dbSNP137), 1000 Genomes data, and the ESP6500 panel (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project [ESP], Seattle, WA), (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).

Additional clinical findings (Fig. 1) included low birth weight (1980 g, <1%), bicoronal craniosynostosis, hypertelorism with short palpebral fissures, microtia, left preaxial polydactyly with bilateral digitalized thumbs, anteriorly displaced anus (ADA), and a sacral dimple. Variational analysis of FGFR1, 2, 3, and TWIST1 were normal. Traditional cytogenetic studies initially revealed trisomy 8 mosaicism in 23% of lymphoblasts.

The patient underwent repair of CDH and congenital heart defect at age 7 and 13 days of life (DOL) respectively, succumbing to cardiac arrest 24 hours post cardiac repair. Postmortem exam revealed the following additional findings: a small abnormally shaped thyroid, absent parathyroid glands, absent thymus (not secondary to surgical removal), intestinal malrotation, an accessory spleen, left unicornuate uterus, and widespread white matter gliosis.

Echocardiogram revealed aberrant left subclavian artery. She also has a history of mild hearing loss, chronic upper respiratory infections, mildly hypernasal speech, humoral deficits, and patellar subluxation. Height and head circumference were always below the curve: at 10 years height was 125 cm (<2%; 50% for 7.5 years) and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) was 48.5 cm (<2%; 50% for 2 years of age). Developmentally, despite her learning difficulties she graduated high school. As a child her neuropsychological testing using the age appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale revealed a full-scale IQ of 85 with a verbal IQ of 91 and a performance IQ of 81.",

Additional findings at birth included atrial septal defect, hypocalcemia, and T-cell lymphopenia. She was born at 37 WG to a G2P1 mother, via planned C-section due to a breech presentation. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Birth weight was 3195 g (75\u201390%), length 51 cm (90%), OFC 34 cm (75\u201390%). Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. However, soon after birth she developed respiratory distress that required intubation and she was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on DOL 3, where she underwent the first reconstructive surgery for her cleft lip and palate. At two weeks of age, FISH for 22q11.2 resulted positive. The patient is now 12 years old. Her height (50%) and weight (75%) are within normal limits. Additional findings include mild scoliosis, recurrent otitis media resulting in mild conductive hearing loss and requiring bilateral myringotomy tube placement, and a learning disability. Research multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) studies revealed a standard LCR22A to LCR22D; however, in an attempt to understand her cleft lip and palate, research sequencing analysis of her remaining 22q11.2 allele initially revealed a hemizygous missense pathogenic variant of SNAP29, which has been associated with CEDNIK syndrome (patient 4 reported by McDonald-McGinn et al.3 and subsequently a CDC45 pathogenic variant [CDC45:NM_001178010:c.241G>A:p.(Val81Ile)]).",

Family history was noncontributory. The infant was delivered by emergency cesarean for a nonreassuring fetal heart rate and required resuscitation and intubation. Birth weight was 2669 g (10%); length was at the 75th percentile. OFC could not be accurately assessed due to the severe cloverleaf skull. Radiographs of the skull revealed metopic and coronal craniosynostosis with wide patency of the entire sagittal suture (Fig. 1), later confirmed by skull radiographs. There was midfacial hypoplasia, a posterior cleft palate, and small mouth. He had sparse brows and lashes, upslanting and short palpebral fissures, proptosis, small pinnae, and attached lobes. Further findings on physical examination included an abdominal wall hernia above the umbilicus, cryptorchidism, a sacral dimple, ADA, arthrogryposis, proximal placement of the thumbs and tapering fingers, left 2\u20133 toe syndactyly, and bilateral aberrantly placed and crowded toes. Chest radiographs revealed a hook-shaped appearance to the distal clavicles. Laboratory tests revealed hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. The association of a conotruncal defect with hypocalcemia prompted FISH testing for 22q11.2 deletion, which was positive. SNP microarray confirmed a standard LCR22A\u2013LCR22D 2.68-Mb deletion at 22q11.2. Plasma amino acids and urine organic acids were normal, as well as variational analysis of FGFR1, 2, 3, and TWIST1. Head computed tomography (CT) findings included near complete absence of the lateral orbital wall, shallow orbits, hypertelorism, and marked bitemporal protrusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe enlargement of the temporal horns with thinning of the temporal lobe parenchyma, a small posterior fossa with compression of the cerebellum and brainstem, and herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum. Thus, cranial vault decompression was performed on DOL 21 and three weeks later. Postoperatively the patient developed intracranial bleeds and seizures and then acquired Enterobacter cloacae pneumonia and became ventilator-dependent. He expired at 53 DOL.",

In the other two patients with rare missense CDC45 pathogenic variants, there was no evidence of cranial developmental anomalies. Interestingly, these patients too had important structural anomalies atypical for 22q11.2DS, most significantly some combination of anal/intestinal anomalies, limb differences, short stature, and craniofacial anomalies.

These variants are probably hypomorphic and the resulting phenotype could be correlated with the expression level and, subsequently, cause a more severe phenotype when they are in trans to a deletion than when homozygous. This has been observed in several diseases, including congenital vertebral malformations and Stargardt disease caused by the combination of null pathogenic variants with hypomorphic alleles in TBX6 and ABCA4 respectively.15,16 Additionally, the presence of homozygous variants in gnomAD could be explained by reduced penetrance in these presumably healthy individuals.",

Notably for those three patients who survived the prediction algorithms were inconsistent (Table 2). Likewise, another recent paper reported on biallelic variants of CDC45 in 15 patients where 4 reached adolescence/adulthood.5 This suggests that either this gene is not as essential in humans as in mice, or, more likely, the phenotype depends on the position of the variant within the gene (Fig. 2). It is also possible that the diverse clinical picture is the result of the incomplete penetrance of the CDC45 pathogenic variants.25 However, to confirm this hypothesis it would be necessary to study the families/patients who have the pathogenic variants in the exact same position.",

In addition, 11/15 of those patients with biallellic CDC45 pathogenic variants had craniosynostosis, which had not previously been reported as a feature of MGS. Based on these findings, the authors suggested that features associated with MGS should be expanded to include craniosynostosis.5 In our cohort with a 22q11.2 deletion and a CDC45 pathogenic variants, much like the Fenwick cohort, only one patient had patellar hypoplasia/agenesis, two of the three living patients had short stature, and three had craniosynostosis (Table 2). In turn, we suggest that the autosomal recessive condition associated with CDC45 biallelic pathogenic variants or monoallelic CDC45 pathogenic variants in the face of a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion should not be included in the MGS phenotypic spectrum but rather should be considered a novel condition. In considering the differential diagnosis for a best fit to account for the phenotype of our patients where craniosynostosis, gastrointestinal/anorectal malformations, and skeletal anomalies are key features, the diagnoses of Baller\u2013Gerold syndrome (BGS, MIM 218600) and RAPADILINO syndrome (MIM 266280) appear to be a closer match (Table 1). Both these conditions are associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in the RECQL4 gene (RecQ like helicase 4, MIM 603780),27\u201329 which encode a protein also required for DNA replication initiation and progression.30 In particular, BGS (Table 1) is characterized by craniosynostosis; gastrointestinal/anorectal anomalies, such as imperforate/anteriorly placed anus; skeletal anomalies like radial ray defects; and short stature.31 However, BGS is only rarely associated with congenital heart defects, which are usually ventricular and/or atrial septal defects, and there is no correlation with cleft lip/palate and urogenital anomalies as we observed in our cohort. Thus, we suggest that a hemizygous pathogenic variant in CDC45 in association with a 22q11.2 deletion and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in CDC45 result in a novel phenotype. Specifically, a condition that is characterized by craniosynostosis, gastrointestinal differences including anorectal malformations, dysphagia, intestinal malrotation, and diaphragmatic and abdominal wall hernia, short stature, skeletal differences including upper limb anomalies, cleft lip/palate, congenital heart defects, genitourinary malformations in both male and females, and developmental differences. Perhaps the acronym CGS (C\u2014craniosynostosis, cleft lip/palate; G\u2014gastrointestinal and genitourinary; S\u2014skeletal and short stature) syndrome would be more appropriate.",

Moreover, consistent with its function in DNA replication, CDC45 expression has been suggested to be somehow involved in genomic instability and cancer proliferation.32\u201334 Also the RECQL4 gene has been reported to cause syndromes associated with increased malignancy risk.28,30 In our cohort and in the cohort of patients with CDC45 biallelic pathogenic variants5 no patient who reached adolescence/adulthood developed cancer. However, further follow-up is needed and it may be useful to extend the CDC45 testing to patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and malignancies.",

In addition, this observation demonstrates once again the utility of sequencing the remaining allele in patients with 22q11DS and atypical features.",
