Here we present a model of infection spread in a well-mixed group of individuals, which usually corresponds to a node in large-scale epidemiological networks. The model uses delay equations that take into account the duration of infection and is based on experimentallyderived time courses of viral load, virus shedding, severity and detectability of symptoms. We show that because of an early onset of infectiousness, which is reported to be synchronous or even precede the onset of detectable symptoms, the tracing and immediate testing of everyone who came in contact with the detected infected individual reduces the spread of epidemics, hospital load, and fatality rate. We hope that this more precise node dynamics could be incorporated into complex large-scale epidemiological models to improve the accuracy and credibility of predictions. * Electronic address:",

Conversely, the diseases with less severe symptoms, such as common colds, spread wider as the symptoms do not limit the mobility and social contacts of the bearers. From what has already become known about the COVID-19, the infection exhibits both those attributes: At the early stages of infection, an already highly contagious bearer may still remains asymptomatic [1] [2] [3] [4] . In addition, an infected and infectious individual may stay completely asymptomatic through the course of the disease. The complications that severely limit mobility and sometimes lead to death usually arrive in the second week after the onset of symptoms or even later ( [5] ). This fairly unusual disease dynamics necessitates more complex mitigation strategies and, thus, epidemiological models. For example, various lockdown criteria and schedules for imposing and exiting quarantine, such as cyclic lockdown-exit scenario proposed in [6] , require accurate predictors of disease dynamics and contagiousness in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic parts of population, especially given the current lack of population-wide testing for active viruses and antibodies.",

This results in replacing the traditional SEIR ordinary differential equations by the delay differential equations similar to [7, 8] . The temporal changes in the infectiousness and severity of symptoms determine the number of secondary infection and serve as an indicator detectability of symptoms and subsequent restrictions in contacts. The time courses of infectiousness and severity of symptoms are taken directly from clinical data or approximated by functional fits to that data. The model confirms that a rapid tracing and testing the contacts, rather than reacting to the detectable symptoms, noticeably restricts the spread of the infection and makes quantitative predictions about level of herd immunity and fatality rate.",

The values of constants C I , C S , C R were chosen to reproduce the reported doubling period of infection at its early stages \u2248 5 days and mortality \u2248 4%. Now we show how the timing of detection and quarantining affects the spread of infection and the eventual outcome of the epidemics. Keeping the rest of parameters the same, we vary the parameter \u03b8 S , which controls the time when the detectability rate is at its maximum. In Fig. 2 we show the fractions of dead, recovered, and remaining susceptible after the infection is over, that is, when the sufficient herd immunity is reached. These fractions in Fig. 2 correspond to the respective fractions at the final time (t = 200 days) in Fig. 1. Also similarly to Fig. 1, we show what fraction of infected individuals were detected as infected through the course of their disease, and what fraction of infections was never detected. It follows from Fig. 2 that the earlier detection reduces the death rate severalfold and almost doubles the number of never infected susceptible.A quick detection of new infection is normally done through contact tracing and testing. We account for these measures by simply shifting the maximum of detectability of symptoms to earlier time, leaving the detection efficiency at the postulated sub-ideal level. Nevertheless, the beneficial epidemiological effect of even such sub-optimal early detection is clearly pronounced. Conversely, even a short delay in contact tracing or processing of the test results, corresponding to an increase in \u03b8 S , brings in more infections and higher fatality rate.FIG. 1: Temporal dynamics of fractions of dead (black), recovered (red), undetected infected (green), detected infected (blue), and susceptible (orange) individuals for the following parameters: The infection rate coefficient C I = 2, the coefficient in the rate of detection of infected C S = 0.5, the death rate coefficient C R = 0.07, the attenuation of death rate and infectiousness after the detection of the disease \u03bd = 0.5 and \u03c7 = 0.2.
