Like many others, our hospital system began looking closely at the recommendations for decreasing transmission of COVID-19, chief among them social distancing. By early March the need for an immediate adaptation of our clinical care delivery system was clear. Within a week clinics had transitioned from in-person visits to telehealth involving telephone or video. Screening processes for COVID-19 were quickly made available on a free online platform through which at-risk individuals were directed to drive-through centers for in-person testing.",

The 529 Meeting Street clinic treats patients at a drop-in resource center serving individuals experiencing housing instability.

It quickly became apparent that the newly built telehealth systems created additional access hurdles for our free clinic patients, and we would soon learn that pockets existed within the larger population that were impacted by these barriers. As is often the case, those whose access was impeded were the most vulnerable to poor health outcomes related to COVID-19.",

Taken within the context of several social determinants of health, we can see how the digital divide occurs and can perpetuate inequity based on various social factors (table 1) .",

This is not unlike the FCC report in 2018 showing within the United States 31% of rural households still lacking access to broadband internet (https://www.fcc.gov/reportsresearch/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2018-broadband-deployment-report).",

At the 529 Meeting Street clinic, a program was developed whereby staff would complete online screening for patients over the telephone and in-person via centrally linked accounts. At the CARES clinic student volunteers and providers performed this service for patients who were able to call into the clinic. This workflow served as a template that was replicated by our health system at large to connect individuals without internet access to the online screening tool through a dedicated phone line staffed by volunteers. In this way the healthcare team served as a proxy and conduit to connect patients to the only provided method for COVID-19 prescreening which was required to obtain a referral to the drive-through testing area.",

These admittedly are not quick fixes, especially while in the midst of a pandemic, however some are more readily initiated such as integration of community workers. Others are to be aimed for in future and worked towards steadily rather than accept the current status quo.",
