Analysis of the full-length genomic sequence of the causative agent of SARS [Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003] established that this agent was a unique coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that displayed no obvious similarity to any other members of the Coronavirus genus. Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) have the longest genome (27,000-31,000 nucleotides) amongst all RNA viruses. They comprise a highly divergent group of RNA-viruses that cause a variety of respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and many animal hosts. Previously available sequences of coronaviruses have been classified according to phylogenetic analysis into three main groups [Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003] . The newly identified sequence of the SARS-CoV was not found to cluster within any existing coronavirus group, thus suggesting the existence of an additional lineage, fourth group, within the Coronavirus genus Poutanen et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003] .",

In particular, within a sliding window of a specified length, Bayesian inference was carried out to determine the support of every clade within a given phylogenetic tree, and these support values were plotted along the alignment as described previously [Paraskevis et al., 2003] . Marginal posterior probabilities between SARS-CoV and sequences of coronaviruses Groups I-III were plotted throughout the concatenated alignment. Posterior probabilities were estimated for a sliding window of 120 amino acids moving in steps of 20 amino acids. Metropolis Coupled Markov Chains Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) analysis was run for 50,000 generations, sampling every 100 steps, and burn-in was set to 5,000 steps. MCMCMC had been checked previously so as to confirm that it had reached equilibrium up to this number of generations in different parts of the alignment, thus suggesting that 5,000 generations could be used as a fixed burnin throughout the alignment.",

Bayesian scanning and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV sequence was related more closely to Group II than the other two groups in most of its genome (e.g., at the region spanning amino acid positions 4309-5612 in reference to the murine hepatitis virus ORF1ab gene) (Fig. 1) . This clustering was supported by high quartet puzzling support values and high posterior probabilities under various substitution models, thus suggesting that 80% of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence is related more closely to coronaviruses Group II than any other members of this family. Likelihood mapping results revealed that all these regions contained enough phylogenetic information (data not shown). Intriguingly, clustering of the SARS-CoV within Group II coronaviruses was not supported significantly in regions spanning amino acid positions: 3937-4309 (920-1240), 5612-5734 (2480-2600), 6159-6284 (3000-3120) (positions in reference to the murine hepatitis virus ORF1ab are indicated with their respective positions in reference to the alignment in the parentheses) (Fig. 2) . In all cases, SARS-CoV was more closely related to Group I, whereas Group II/Group III-SARS-CoV/Group I nodes were separated by very small distances. Likelihood mapping in the above regions revealed that they contain sufficient phylogenetic signal. Thus, according to the results of phylogenetic analysis, it is suggested that SARS-CoV provides a separate lineage in these three genomic regions (Fig. 2) . Moreover, in region spanning amino acid positions 4373-4540 (1300-1440), Bayesian inference suggested a significant cluster between Group III and SARS-CoV, whereas this finding was not supported by the ML method. However, according to likelihood mapping analysis, the phylogenetic signal is very limited in this region; thus we cannot reliably infer the evolutionary relationships in this region. Similarly, in a small fragment at the 5 0 of M gene (amino acid positions 15-104 (4540-4620) with reference to the M protein of the murine hepatitis virus) showed a similar topology to the previous fragment, whereas given the discrepancy between Bayesian and ML methods, it cannot be deduced that SARS-CoV is related more closely to Group III.",

The clustering between SARS-CoV and Group II is close to the root and probably reflects the evolutionary relationship between the ''parental'' sequences, from which SARS-CoV originated, and Group II. Moreover, it was found that in three distinct genomic regions (aa positions 3937-4309, 5612-5734, 6159-6284), SARS-CoV shows no apparent similarity with any of the coronavirus groups characterized previously. These findings provide a new insight, in addition to previous studies, where SARS-CoV (using the Neighbor Joining method for phylogenetic tree reconstruction) was found not to be related significantly to any of the three coronavirus groups, or was separated by a short internal branch from Group I and III . Moreover, three recent analyses indicated that SARS CoV was related more closely to Group II in partial genomic regions Rest and Mindell, 2003; Snijder et al., 2003 ]. On the other hand, several analyses have noted that though SARS CoV is close to Group II, it has a recombinant origin [Rest and Mindell, 2003; Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004] , but these analyses were based only on partial genomic regions, and did not include an exploratory analysis using a sliding window approach [Rest and Mindell, 2003; Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004] .",
