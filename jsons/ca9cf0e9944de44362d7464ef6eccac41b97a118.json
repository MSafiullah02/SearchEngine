MERS-CoV is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. MERS-CoV infection leads to a variety of clinical outcomes in humans ranging from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe acute lung injury and multi-organ failure and death. To study the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection and development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for MERS, a number of genetically modified mouse models have been developed, including various versions of transgenic mice expressing the human DPP4 viral receptor. Tracking and quantifying viral infection, among others, in permissive hosts is a key endpoint for studying MERS pathogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of selected MCMs developed for MERS. In addition to quantifying infectious progeny virus which requires highcontainment biosafety level (BSL)-3 laboratory, here we outlined an established real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-based procedure to unequivocally quantify MERS-CoV-specific RNAs within the lungs of infected human DPP4 (hDPP4, transgenic (hDPP4 Tg) mice under a standard BSL-2 laboratory.

Since its emergence, MERS-CoV has infected more than 2280 individuals with over 800 deaths in 27 countries around the world, with the majority of the infections occurring in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV is classified as a lineage C betacoronavirus (Beta-CoV). Beta-CoV is one of four genera of the coronaviruses of the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae [2] . In addition to MERS-CoV, the Beta-CoV genus also contains the SARS-CoV (lineage B), and other human coronaviruses such as OC43 and HKU1 (lineage A) [2] . Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses with a large positive-sense, single-stranded genome that ranges in size from 28 to 32 kbp and characterized by having crown-like projections on the virus particles [3] . The genome of the MERS-CoV is about 30.1 kbp long and contains 11 open reading frames (ORFs). Like other coronaviruses, the first two-thirds of the MERS-CoV genome contains two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, that encode the viral replicase-transcriptase complex, the nonstructural proteins 1-16 (nsp1-16). The remaining one-third of the genome comprises ORFs that encodes the structural proteins, which include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition to these structural and nonstructural proteins shared by other coronaviruses, the MERS-CoV genome also contains several ORFs coding for accessory proteins, namely ORF3, ORF4a, and ORF4b [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 136, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 504, "end": 507, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 658, "end": 661, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 868, "end": 871, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1564, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Because of its high mortality rate and its potential to spread worldwide, it is important to study MERS-CoV pathogenesis in animal models.

We have recently developed a transgenic (Tg) mouse model, expressing the human DPP4, that is highly permissive to MERS-CoV infection and disease [7, 8] .
