Among these studies on the effect of healthcare environment on patient outcomes, seven were on humidity; four on air filtration system; four on ventilation system; two on temperature; one on (increase outside air changes, improve filter efficiency, maintain constant temperature and humidity, increase positive pressure of operating room air). They30 concluded that there is convincing evidence linking patients\u2019 clinical outcomes and built environment parameters. Zimring et al32 identified a connection between the hospital indoor environment and patient and staff outcomes with respect to four sectors: staff stress and fatigue reduction and increased effectiveness in delivering care; patient safety improvement; stress reduction and improvement in patient outcomes; and overall healthcare quality improvement. Dijkstra et al23 summarized literature on environmental stimuli (eg, furniture, art, color, nature, plants, gardens, carpeting, room size, spatial layout, private rooms, noise, music, odor, television/video, light, windows, and view from a window) and their impact on patients\u2019 psychological outcomes rather than on direct physiological outcomes.

Results also suggested that six ACH is optimum, and similar conclusions have been found for hospital isolation rooms.87 Through a CFD study, Memarzadeh and Jiang175 suggested that total ventilation rates over 10 ACH will not be effective for Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIR) since this flow rate did not decrease the exposure to infectious disease transmission. Based on the review on aerosol\u2010transmitted infections in the isolation room, Tang et al134 recommended minimum 12 ACH, so that the air moves from healthcare workers to a patient. They134 also suggested that placing patients close to the exhaust vent will reduce the cross\u2010contamination risks. A study following airflow modeling and particle tracking methodologies concluded that an OR with ceiling heights between 2.74 m (9 ft) and 3.66 m (12 ft) should maintain 20\u201025 ACH for contamination control.184 A study on 4\u2010bed patient rooms showed a minor reduction in infectious disease transmission through hand colonization when ventilation rates change from four ACH to six ACH.185 The results of a CFD simulation in the general wards of Hong Kong hospitals showed that a flow rate of nine ACH effectively minimized infection risk of three respiratory viruses.186 Table 3 below summarizes the recommended minimum total ACH of the supply air and outside air comparison between Ninomura and Bartley187 and English.166\n",
