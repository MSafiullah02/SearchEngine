Viruses may contain: linear double-stranded (ds) DNAs; circular ds DNAs; linear or circular single-stranded (ss) DNAs; coding (' \u00fe strand') RNAs; RNAs (' \u00c0 strand') whose complements encode viral proteins; and dsRNAs. In some RNAcontaining viruses ('ambisense'), part of the RNA is \u00fe strand and part isstrand; in some, individual virus particles contain multiple RNA molecules, which together constitute the viral genome and all of which are required for successful replication of the virus; in others, the RNAs required for replication are distributed among different particles. Some virus particles contain RNA, but this RNA is copied into DNA when the virus infects a new host cell. The size and complexity of viruses also varies over an enormous range: the nucleic acids may contain as few as 2000 bases or more than 2 \u00c2 10 6 bases, corresponding to coding capacities ranging from two proteins to over 2000 proteins.",

Therefore, each virus has a way of both replicating and expressing its nucleic acid; these strategies exploit the tools available within the susceptible host cell. In turn, viruses are incomparable sources of information about cellular processes; indeed, much of our most fundamental knowledge about biology, including the fact that DNA is the repository of genetic information in cells and that DNA is copied into mRNA for its expression, has been obtained using viruses (Brenner et al., 1961; Hershey and Chase, 1952; Judson, 1996) . Table 1 presents a partial listing of the nucleic acids in different virus families. One of the most fundamental distinctions between viruses is whether they contain DNA or RNA. As cellular genetic information is carried in DNA, many DNA viruses rely on cellular machinery for both replication of their genomes and production of mRNA transcripts for gene expression. In contrast, cells do not normally make copies of RNA molecules; thus, RNA viruses must encode the proteins needed for RNA replication, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",

Another striking difference between DNA and RNA viruses is in the range of their genome sizes: while the largest RNA virus genomes, those of the coronaviruses, are approximately 32 kb, DNA viral genomes can be nearly 100 times larger, as Pandoravirus DNA is approximately 2.5 \u00c2 10 6 bp.",

The other absolute requirement is that somehow an RNA (or RNAs) of the coding strand must be produced for translation into the virus-coded proteins. The various pathways of information transfer to mRNA are summarized in Figure 1 , and were well summarized over 40 years ago (Baltimore, 1971) . It is important to realize that viral nucleic acids possess, in addition to protein-coding sequences, cis-acting signals that often perform essential functions in virus replication. Examples are sequences recognized by viral proteins for packaging the genomic nucleic acid into progeny virus particles and sequences required for initiation of complementary nucleic acid strands. In general, when viral genomes are engineered for use as vectors, the sequences encoding viral proteins can be replaced and the needed proteins provided in trans, but the cis-acting signals must be preserved to permit replication of the vector.",

In cellular DNA synthesis, the primers for one of the two strands are short RNA molecules. dsDNA viruses use a variety of primers in DNA synthesis. The DNA of SV40, a member of the Polyomavirus family, is replicated by the same basic mechanisms as cellular DNA (Figure 2(a) ; Stenlund, 2003) . In contrast, in both adenoviruses and hepadnaviruses, the primer is a viral protein: the new DNA chain is initiated by addition of a deoxynucleotide to an -OH group on the side-chain of a specific amino acid in a virus-coded protein (Figure 2(b) ; Van der Vliet, 1995) . In other dsDNA viruses, special structures in the DNA are involved in its replication. For example, poxvirus genomic DNAs For simplicity, only one virus family is shown as an example for each group.

These small viruses rely on the host cell (and, for some ssDNA viruses, coinfecting larger viruses) for much of their replication machinery. These 'minimalist' viruses may encode only a single structural protein and a single protein involved in their DNA replication. It seems reasonable to speculate that the genome size of ssDNA viruses is limited because a single nick in viral DNA will be a fatal disruption of their genome, unlike in organisms whose information is carried in dsDNA. However, some ssDNA viruses are more complex: these include the Nanoviridae, in which the entire genome is composed of 6 to 8 B1-kb ssDNA segments, each packaged in a separate particle; the Pleolipoviridae, which infect Archaea and contain a single circular ssDNA molecule ranging up to approximately 10 kb in size; and the Bidnaviridae, which infect silkworms and whose genomes consist of a 6 kb and a 6.5 kb DNA molecule, encapsidated separately. The DNA in these viruses can be either circular or linear; in the latter case, 'hairpin' structures at the ends of the DNA participate in priming of DNA replication (Figure 2 (c)). In some ssDNA viruses, either of the two complementary strands can be packaged, so that a virus preparation is a mixture of particles with either strand; in others, only one of the strands is packaged into virions. The DNAs of ssDNA viruses are replicated by a mechanism similar to 'rolling circle' replication, involving synthesis of dsDNA intermediates containing multiple tandem copies of the viral genome. It should be noted that the template for the mRNAs of ssDNA viruses is not the ssDNA that the infecting virion brings into the cell, but rather the dsDNA produced intracellularly in infected cells ( Figure 1 ).",

The dsRNA genomes cannot, of course, be translated directly, but they serve as templates for production of ( \u00fe ) strand mRNA molecules. In fact, after infection the dsRNAs in the cytoplasm are retained in a subviral particle; the 'progeny' mRNA molecules are extruded from these particles through pores at 5-fold axes of icosahedral symmetry. (As an icosahedron has 12 5fold axes, this appears to place an absolute limit on the number of genomic RNA segments that can be accommodated in these viruses.) This sequestration of the dsRNA in an intracellular subviral particle may serve to shield this RNA from detection by elements of the innate immune system. Upon release from the subviral particle, the ( \u00fe ) strand mRNAs are translated in the cytoplasm; they are also incorporated into newly assembling subviral particles, where they are copied by the viral polymerase into ( \u00c0 ) strand RNAs, thus reproducing the dsRNA genomic RNA of the virus.",

            "text": "(3) production of multiple mRNAs (Figure 4(c) ). For example, the alphaviruses (e.g., Sindbis virus) are ( \u00fe ) strand RNA viruses whose incoming viral RNA is translated at the outset of the infection. However, the ( \u00c0 ) strand produced by copying the viral RNA contains one or more internal promoters for the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase. Thus, the RNAs produced during replication include not only full-length ( \u00fe ) and ( \u00c0 ) strand copies of the genome, but smaller RNAs of ( \u00fe ) strand polarity, representing only a portion of the genomic sequence, that will also serve as mRNAs. In a somewhat analogous strategy, coronaviruses produce a nested series of mRNAs encoding different viral proteins. (4) the presence in the genome of a special RNA structure, the 'internal ribosomal entry site' or IRES (Figure 4(d) , left panel; Fraser and Doudna, 2007; Martinez-Salas et al., 2008) . An IRES obviates the requirement for the 5\u2032 cap structure in initiation of translation. In many viruses, it is located near the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA, and functions principally in protecting the viral mRNA from the inhibitory effects that the virus exerts upon normal, 5\u2032 capdependent translation of host mRNAs. However, in some viruses including cricket paralysis virus, an IRES in the interior of the viral RNA allows translation of an internally placed open reading frame (Figure 4(d) , bottom left). IRES elements derived from viral genomes have been extremely useful in the design of vectors for simultaneous expression of two genes from a single mRNA. A somewhat analogous mechanism is called termination-reinitiation: here the AUG of a second open reading frame in the RNA overlaps the termination codon of a first reading frame within the 5-base sequence UAAUG (Figure 4(d) , right panel). Initiation at this AUG is dependent upon a special sequence placed 5\u2032 to this junction. Termination-reinitiation is used in ( \u00fe ) strand RNA viruses such as caliciviruses, dsRNA viruses, and ( \u00c0 ) strand viruses. (5) inefficient suppression of the termination codon at the end of an open reading frame, so that some ribosomes continue translating past the termination codon (Figure 4(e) ). These ribosomes produce a fusion protein, containing some or all of the sequence encoded 5\u2032 of the termination codon and, in addition, the sequence 3\u2032 of this codon. The suppression can either be by inefficient translation of the termination codon as an amino acid (as in alphaviruses) or by ribosomal frameshifting at a site 5\u2032 of the termination codon (as in coronaviruses). Both of these mechanisms are also used by retroviruses (Hatfield et al., 1992) . Successful virus replication in these cases requires the optimal efficiency of suppression, yielding the proper ratio of extended to terminated translation products. This ratio is often in the range of 1:10. In some retroviruses, there are two successive frameshift sites, resulting in the production of three proteins from the same mRNA molecule. (6) 'leaky scanning,' in which some ribosomes initiate translation at the 5\u2032-most AUG on an RNA, while others bypass this AUG and initiate at a downstream AUG (Figure 4 (f)). The efficiency of utilization of the AUGs is largely governed by their surrounding sequence contexts. In some retroviruses, the viral RNA contains a CUG in an excellent context for initiation, with an AUG further downstream in the same reading frame; both of these codons are used for initiation, resulting in the production of two protein species, identical except for an N-terminal extension on one of them.",

We have attempted here to briefly indicate the amazing diversity of information-transmission mechanisms found among viruses. Indeed, it is striking that viruses exhibit far more diversity in this regard than do cellular organisms, whose genomes are exclusively dsDNA. However, all viral genomes larger than those of coronaviruses are also composed of dsDNA. Perhaps this is because dsDNA is more resistant than other nucleic acids to the vicissitudes of mutation and chemical and physical damage. In any case, the study of viruses can only inspire wonder at the unimaginable variety found among living things.",
