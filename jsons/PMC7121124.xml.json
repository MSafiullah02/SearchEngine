Run the gel for approximately 40 min.Turn off the power supply when the tracking dye has migrated a sufficient distance.Remove the cover and retrieve the gel (see\nNote\n16).Place the gel on an ultraviolet transilluminator. Switch on the power of the gel photo-documentation machine (see\nNote\n17).Adjust the position of the gel and record the results.

The sensitivity of the PCR could be reduced if you repeat freezing and thawing of fecal samples. Store samples in multiple small aliquots to avoid repeated freeze\u2013thaw cycles which accelerate degradation of nucleic acids, especially RNA.The disodium salt of EDTA will not dissolve until the pH of the solution is adjusted to 8.0 by the addition of NaOH.Dissolution of GuSCN is facilitated by heating in a 60\u201365 \u00b0C water bath under continuous shaking.Buffers L6 and L2 are stable for at least 3 weeks at room temperature in the dark [13].The three primers used in SN- PCR were designed from the highly conserved region of the N gene of the Mebus strain (GenBank accession number U00735).Phenol is highly corrosive and can cause severe burns to skin. Personal protective equipment such as gloves, safety glasses, and a lab coat are essentials whenever working with phenol.Be careful not to transfer any of the protein at the interphase.Phenol and chloroform are considered hazardous chemicals by waste environment protection agencies and similar bodies around the world. Discard phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol waste in a properly labeled container. For more information regarding hazardous waste management, contact your state hazardous waste agency.Be careful to stir the tube containing hydrated silica before use to resuspend settled silica.Be careful not to disturb the silica pellet when discarding the supernatant. Attention: GuSCN-containing waste should be collected in a strong alkaline solution (10 N NaOH).If you perform the RT-PCR on the same day, RNA extraction can be conserved at 4 \u00b0C. For a longer conservation period, RNA must be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.It is recommended to carry out the cDNA synthesis immediately after the RNA preparation. Being more stable than RNA, the storage of a first-strand cDNA is less critical.Alternatively, the gel can be stained after DNA separation by electrophoresis. Place the gel into a container filled with 100 ml of TBE running buffer and 5 \u03bcl of ethidium bromide. Let the gel soak in this solution for 20\u201330 min. Wash the gel briefly with water before visualization under UV light.Ethidium bromide is mutagenic and moderately toxic and must be handled with care. Wear a lab coat, eye protection, and gloves when working with this chemical.Liquid (running buffer) and solid (agarose gel, gloves, tips) waste contaminated with ethidium bromide must be managed as a hazardous waste. No liquids should be placed in the containers with the solid wastes. For more information regarding hazardous waste management, contact your state hazardous waste agency.\nDNA will diffuse within the gel over time. Therefore, examination or photography should take place shortly after cessation of electrophoresis.Exposure to UV light can cause severe skin and eye damage. Wear safety glasses and close the photography hood before turning on the UV transilluminator. Be certain to turn off UV light immediately after gel image is captured.\n",
