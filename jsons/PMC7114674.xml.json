            "text": "Since being introduced roughly two centuries ago for smallpox, vaccines have significantly contributed to human health as one of the most effective tools in preventing and treating fatal diseases. Traditionally, either whole inactivated or live attenuated microorganisms are injected, however, this method sometimes leads to side effects that range from mild to unacceptable. Recently, purified or recombinated macromolecules of pathogens, such as surface proteins or polysaccharides, have been used increasingly in clinical trials to minimize the possible side effects. As additional knowledge of the workings of the immune system on a molecular level is acquired, more efforts can be directed towards the development of highly efficient but safe vaccines for diseases such as AIDS and cancers that have previously eluded treatment via vaccination [1], [2], [3]. Cancer immunotherapy has been identified as one of the most plausible alternatives to conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery as it possesses many unique advantages. These include highly specific delivery to targeted cells, memory to pre-immuned diseases, and simple administrations (e.g., injection, inhalation of aerosol vaccine, and skin patch) [4]. As more detailed information of the mechanism of the disease becomes available, the delivery of therapeutic molecules has become one of the most important targets for the development of a successful vaccination strategy.",

However, no universal vaccine system displaying all of these requirements has been developed thus far. To deliver antigens to phagocytic APCs, various delivery systems such as liposomes, microparticles, and nanotubes have been studied [6], [7], [8]. Using these delivery vehicles, the antigens mixed with adjuvant molecules, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have demonstrated prolonged immune responses and increased local inflammation [9].",

Endogenous antigen-derived peptides are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which activate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response, or cellular immunity, after binding to T cell receptors. In contrast, an antibody-mediated response, also referred to as humoral immunity, is activated through exogenous antigen-derived peptide/MHC II complexes on APCs. Therefore, it is presumed that a desirable immune response can be achieved by controlling the antigen presentation pathway and cellular immune response has been reported to be more effective in removing infected cells and cancers than humoral immunity [10]. In previous studies, it has been shown that an increased MHC I antigen presentation can be achieved by priming APCs with antigen-encapsulating acid-degradable nanoparticles, which degrade at acidic pH following phagocytosis to release the antigens into the cytoplasm [11], [12], [13].",

An aqueous solution of monomers was prepared by dissolving acrylamide (Biorad, Hercules, CA), 2-acryloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride (AETMAC, Aldrich), 5 mg ammonium persulfate (APS, Biorad), and acid-labile benzyl acetal cross-linker [13] in 200 \u03bcL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 8.0) containing 10 mg/mL of ovalbumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The aqueous solution of monomers was combined with 20 mL of the organic surfactant solution. After vigorously shaking the mixture for 1 min, polymerization was initiated by the addition of 20 \u03bcL of N,N,N\u00b4,N\u00b4-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED, Sigma). The mixture was stirred for 10 min before adding an excess of acetone (1.5\u20132 times the volume of the organic surfactant solution) to settle the clumped nanoparticles, followed by an additional 10 min of gentle stirring. After standing 1 h, the precipitated pellet was washed once with acetone and dried under vacuum overnight. By changing the ratio of AETMAC to acrylamide, various cationic nanoparticles were prepared at a fixed crosslinking ratio of 5%. For comparison, non-degradable polyacrylamide nanoparticles were made using acrylamide and N,N\u00b4-methylenebisacrylamide (Biorad).",

For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the nanoparticle suspension in PBS was spotted onto a formvar/carbon grid (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). After 5 min the grid was washed with distilled water twice and then dried at room temperature for 2 h. To minimize hydrolysis of the particles, the samples were examined immediately after drying with a Philips Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope with 100 kV. The diameters of 100 randomly chosen nanoparticles were estimated from the TEM image by using NIH Image (version 4.02, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The amount of protein encapsulated was determined using ovalbumin that had been conjugated with pH-insensitive cascade blue dye (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR). The labeled protein was prepared according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The particles were hydrolyzed by incubating with 300 mM acetic acid buffer pH 5.0 for 3 h at room temperature. Ovalbumin concentrations were quantified by measuring the cascade blue fluorescence, obtained by exciting the solutions at 355 nm and detecting the emitted 405 nm wavelength using a fluorescence plate reader.",

The microemulsion was achieved by vigorous shaking instead of sonication, as the latter may potentially damage the encapsulated molecules. Since it was found that particles pelleted by centrifugation were not always readily resuspended in aqueous solutions, the nanoparticles were harvested by precipitation using gravity only. After treating with acetone, the surfactants present on the surface of the particles were washed away and the cationic surfaces were exposed to non-polar hexane solvent. Following settling of visible clumps of aggregated particles a second acetone wash was performed to remove the proteins on the surface of the particles. The degree of cationic surface charge was easily manipulated by varying the ratio of acrylamide to AETMAC monomers (Table 1\n). Although increased antigen presentation has been achieved using acid-degradable particles, and facilitated internalization of cationic molecules has also been reported. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to explore the simultaneous realization of both of these major goals.",

Regardless of the cationic monomer ratio, the DLS results showed that the size of particles ranged between 180\u2013230 nm in diameter (Fig. 2a), which bridges the size regimes for pinocytosis and phagocytosis [20]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also confirmed the size distribution, giving an average diameter of 217 \u00b1 49 nm (Fig. 3\n). Therefore, the particles are expected to be taken up exclusively by phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells) in a size-dependent passive targeting. Since a reduced uptake of latex particles larger than 280 nm by DCs was reported previously [21], the smaller particles prepared here can be efficiently taken up by DCs. Although particles with 10% and 20% cationic monomer displayed a slightly smaller diameter, the content of cationic monomer did not significantly affect particle size distributions (Fig. 2a). A similar size distribution was observed with non-degradable nanoparticles prepared in similar fashion. As expected, zeta potential, or relative positive charge density, increased as the ratio of cationic monomer to acrylamide was increased (Fig. 2b).",

Neutral and 20% cationic acid-degradable nanoparticles exhibited 25% lower encapsulation efficiencies compared to the 5% and 10% cationic nanoparticles. The amount of encapsulated proteins in non-degradable particles cannot be determined using the method used with degradable particles (due to the lack of degradability of the former).

This suggests that the amounts of encapsulated protein are comparable in the non-degradable and the degradable particles.",

To determine if the acid-degradability of the particles increases the release of encapsulated protein into the cytosol and, hence, increases antigen presentation by MHC I, acid-degradable and non-degradable particles with various cationic ratios were prepared and incubated with BMDCs. The relative amounts of ovalbumin-derived peptide SIINFEKL with Kb (MHC I) presented by BMDCs were quantified by cultivation with the B3Z hybrima T cell line. Overall, more SIINFEKL peptides were presented with MHC I after delivery in acid-degradable nanoparticles than in non-degradable ones (Fig. 4\n). Therefore, acid-degradability aids in the release of ovalbumin into the cytoplasm, where proteins are cleaved by proteasomes, and integrated with MHC I in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This is because it is thought that the particles are taken up by APCs through phagocytosis then transferred to the acidic lysosome. The acid sensitivity of the cross-linker holding the particles together not only helps to release protein from the particle, but also their delivery to the cytoplasm [12]. Ovalbumin encapsulated in non-degradable particles is expected to be released more slowly and would therefore be more susceptible to degradation by the proteases present in the lysosome.",

Cells incubated with cationic nanoparticles showed a higher fluorescence intensity, indicative of more internalized particles, than the cells incubated with neutral nanoparticles (Fig. 6\n). Some of the cells (\u223c20%) incubated with neutral nanoparticles showed higher fluorescence than the others, possibly an artifact of the polydispersity of the particles. The cells that take up larger particles, most likely containing more of the fluorescent ovalbumin, showed higher fluorescence intensity (see the arrow on Fig. 6a). The particle uptake kinetics showed that increased endocytosis of cationic nanoparticles occurred throughout the incubation period of 1 h (Fig. 6c). The fluorescence reached a plateau after 1 h because all of the protein had been processed. Typically, an antigen is degraded and processed inside a cell within a timeframe of 0.5\u20133 h. The saturation of uptake corresponding to the plateau in fluorescence might be mainly due to the balance between the endocytosis and antigen processing. It should be noted that the fluorescence measurements gave similar results when performed after 1 h with gentle mixing every 15 min (data not shown).",

This result could be due to the cationic nature of the particles. Cationic delivery vehicles such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly-l-lysine (PLL) have been shown to inhibit cellular viability and proliferation, even though they are efficiently taken up by cells [22]. To determine the toxicity of our delivery system, acid-degradable cationic nanoparticles were incubated with BMDCs for 6 h, and the relative viability was quantified using the conventional MTT assay. Results showed that the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles increases with concentration regardless of the cationic ratio (Fig. 7\n). Even 20% decreased viability was observed with neutral nanoparticles at the highest concentration of 500 \u03bcg/well, where antigen presentation was dramatically decreased (Fig. 4a). Possible explanations for the observed cytotoxicity of neutral acid-degradable nanoparticles include: (i) the existence of a threshold amount of particles that can be processed without retarding cellular proliferation; (ii) the intrinsic toxicity of polyacrylamide in the cell; and (iii) the cytotoxicity of the benzaldehyde released after hydrolysis. The 10% and 20% cationic nanoparticles, especially the 20% sample, showed significant cytotoxicity at the concentrations of 250 and 500 \u03bcg/well (Fig. 7) with decreased antigen presentation (Fig. 4a). However, at the concentration of 50 \u03bcg/well, comparable cytotoxicity of neutral and 10% cationic nanoparticles was observed, while 20% cationic nanoparticles showed significantly lower proliferation. Given these toxicity and antigen presentation studies, the most efficient cationic delivery system at a reasonably acceptable concentration appears to be that with 10% cationic monomer at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/well equivalent to 0.25 mg/mL. These particles displayed the highest antigen presentation (Fig. 4a), with high proliferation (Fig. 7), and a more efficient uptake due to the positive surface charge (Fig. 5, Fig. 6).",

Immature DCs are specialized in antigen capture whereas mature DCs present degraded peptides with upregulated MHC II, and costimulatory and adhesion molecules. One of the typical features of mature DCs is the unique morphology with long and thin dendrites, which are thought to be advantageous for maximizing antigen presentation and T cell junctions. Very interestingly, BMDCs incubated with 10% cationic degradable nanoparticles displayed a highly dendritic surface (Fig. 8b), while similar dendritic cells incubated with 10% cationic nondegradable particles showed an immature stellate shape (Fig. 8a). This observation suggests that degradable particles enhance antigen presentation not only by releasing encapsulated proteins into the cytoplasm but also by triggering DC maturation. Although lysosomal disruption by acid-degradable particles seems to cause BMDC maturation, a mechanism for this event is not clear at this time. Obviously, DC maturation would constitute another advantage for the use of acid-degradable vaccine carrier as a result of such enhanced immune activation.",

Immunostimulatory unmethylated CpG ODN was coated on the acid-degradable 10% cationic nanoparticles and incubated with BMDCs for 24 h. Activation of the DCs was then quantified by IL-12 secretion, which polarizes CD4+ T helper cell type 1 (TH1) differentiation rather than TH2 and eventually assists in CTL activation. Fig. 9a clearly illustrates that BMDCs produced at least 10 times more IL-12 after incubation with CpG ODN-coated acid-degradable nanoparticles than controls of cells alone, BMDCs incubated with free CpG ODN, or the nanoparticles without CpG ODN. Similarly, AS10 ODN was adsorbed onto the cationic acid-degradable nanoparticles. The secretion of IL-10, an antagonist cytokine to IL-12, by BMDCs was inhibited by delivery of AS10 ODN. A 60% decrease in IL-10 secretion was observed when the oligonucleotide was combined with cationic nanoparticles (Fig. 9b). Therefore, the formulation of acid-degradable cationic nanoparticles can be tuned to produce the maximum CTL-mediated immune response by stimulating IL-12 secretion and inhibiting IL-10 expression by DCs.",

However, it was discovered that simply injecting cancer antigens was not sufficient to activate an anti-cancer immune response, as not only cancer cells but also normal cells express the same antigen (i.e., cancer-associated antigen) [5]. Frequently, cancer cells downregulate MHC molecules so that expression of cancer antigens is insufficient [23]. Once established, cancer cells also secrete cytokines and form new rigid tumor tissue as a defense against immune attack [24]. Therefore, developing an efficient cancer vaccine is urgently needed. As more knowledge and understanding of cancer becomes available, and as more unique cancer antigens are identified, the design of an effective antigen delivery vehicle becomes more critical. The ideal carrier should possess the properties of specific targeting, efficient antigen delivery, activation of proper immune responses, facile and inexpensive preparation, and simple administration and storage.",

DCs reside in antigen-encountering areas, such as under the skin and the mucosal layer. After antigen uptake and maturation, DCs migrate to lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes and activate na\u00efve T and B cells by very efficiently presenting antigen-derived peptides with costimulatory molecules, resulting in the secretion of cytokines at high concentrations upon activation [27], [28]. DCs are also more susceptible than other cells to viral infections like human inmmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus so that viral antigens are presented efficiently [29], [30]. It has also been shown that DCs link innate immunity with adaptive immunity. Therefore, it is a general consensus that the targeting and priming of DCs is a critical target for the development of a successful vaccine strategy.",

            "text": "It was demonstrated that acid-degradable nanoparticles are significantly more effective in antigen presentation by MHC I than non-degradable nanoparticles (Fig. 4). A possible explanation for this finding is that more proteins are released into cytoplasmic space with the acid-degradable particles than is the case with the non-degradable ones. It was previously hypothesized that release of the small molecule aldehyde after hydrolysis might destabilize the lysosomal membrane due to increased osmotic pressure [12], followed by cytosolic release of the antigen. In addition, the swelling effect of the hydrogel nanoparticles resulting from the cross-linker cleavage may also contribute to the more facile release as swelling could lead to a leaky lysosomal membrane structure. However, more studies must be undertaken to clarify the cellular behavior of acid-degradable particles since there is still a dearth of supporting evidence for endosomal (or lysosomal) escape of extracellular molecules. For example, it was believed that a polycationic polymer (e.g., PEI) aided in endosomal escape by the proton sponge effect. However, this theory was recently criticized by some studies with various protonated groups indicating no difference in endosomal escape [31], [32]. As shown in Fig. 8, the degradability of the particles favors distribution of the antigenic payload throughout the cytoplasmic space, thereby contributing to more efficient presentation of antigen-derived peptides through DC maturation. Another possible explanation of the enhanced antigen presentation is the protection of proteins from lysosomal degradation in the encapsulated microenvironment of the nanoparticles, slowing or even negating the effect of proteases and minimizing exposure to the degrading conditions of the lysosome as a result of fast release into the cytoplasm. Therefore, more proteins would be successfully processed in the cytoplasm and presented on MHC I molecules.",

The nanoparticles used in this study have also demonstrated the ability to adsorb negatively charged DNA and the cationic surface ratio was easier to modulate with these nanoparticles than was the case with previously reported systems.",

            "text": "Due to the progress in immunology, it has been revealed that an immune response is the result of the cell\u2013cell interactions in very complicated networks under strict control. This response is mediated by surface molecules (e.g., receptors) and/or secreted macromolecules (e.g., cytokines). Once an unmethylated CpG DNA binds to TLR9 located under the cell surface and migrates to an endosomal or lysosomal compartment, APCs are activated to secrete cytokines (e.g., IL-12) and to upregulate costimulatory surface molecules (e.g., B7) [41], [42]. A recent study reported that TLR also regulates the maturation of the phagosome [43]. Therefore, delivering CpG DNA helps CTL activation by upregulating costimulatory molecules on the DC surface and encouraging the secretion of TH1-polarizing IL-12. This directed immunostimulatory response can be maximized by suppressing antagonistic IL-10 secretion, for example, which can be accomplished by delivering antisense oligonucleotides, as shown in this study (Fig. 9). Interestingly, some studies have indicated that the cross-presentation\u2014presentation of extracellular antigen by MHC I\u2014of CpG DNA-conjugated proteins was induced by DCs [44], [45]. This means that CpG DNA helps not only to stimulate innate immunity but also amplifies CTL-mediated immunity (or cellular immunity) rather than humoral immunity by cytokine release and cross-presentation. Therefore, it is expected that the cationic nature of the acid-degradable nanoparticles used in this study can be very useful as cancer vaccine carriers capable of adjusting immune responses.",

The enhanced MHC I-mediated antigen presentation that is observed appears to be related to the acid-degradability of the particles. Cationic particles are endocytosed more efficiently than neutral ones, although the amount and cationic density of the particles requires optimization due to the innate cytotoxicity of cationic species. Finally, maximized cellular immunity can be achieved by delivering antigens with adjuvant nucleotides adsorbed onto the cationic surface of the acid-degradable particles.",
