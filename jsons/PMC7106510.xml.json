            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) represent a major threat to public health. Influenza virus (FLUV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) respiratory infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in both pediatric and adult population worldwide [1], [2]. Seasonal FLUV has been estimated to affect 5\u201310% of the world\u2019s population [3] and by the age of two, practically all children are estimated to have been infected at least once with HRSV [4]. An early identification of the causative pathogen is essential for a prompt and appropriate patient management [5]. Furthermore, it minimizes the patient hospitalization stay and risk of complications, as well as it aims to establish a rapid implementation of isolation and control measures reducing the nosocomial transmission risk [6]. Microbiological tests are needed for a precise and rapid identification of the causative agents. Among them, techniques such as viral culture isolation and antigen-based assays have been widely used in the past. However, these techniques have low and widely variable sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, they are time-consuming and labour-intensive [7]. Therefore, molecular tests are nowadays considered the best detection choice as they have demonstrated to be the most sensitive and specific techniques. In addition, the use of multiplex PCR-based methods enables a rapid and accurate identification of multiple targets in the same reaction [8].",

This assay is strengthened with Seegene\u2019s automation extraction and PCR setup platform MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, Nevada, USA) or similar.

The real-time RT-PCR was done on the CFX96\u2122 (Bio-Rad, California, USA) platform, and subsequently interpreted by Seegene\u2019s Viewer software. For Hologic\u2019s assay, NA were extracted from 200 \u03bcl of the respiratory specimen to be eluted in 100 \u03bcl using NucliSense easyMAG (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019\u00c9toile, France) according to manufacturer's instructions. The real-time RT-PCR was done on the SmartCycler (Cepheid, California, USA) platform.

Moreover, the three studied assays showed excellent specificity and PPV values. An important characteristic of Allplex RP1 to be highlighted is that it works detecting two different targets of FLUAV in a single reaction allowing to determine FLUAV subtype and then improving its detection. Though ProFAST+ assay showed highest sensitivity values than Allplex RP1 assay for FLUAV subtyping, Hologic assay required to perform an additional reaction increasing the final test cost. In addition, it is important to consider that in the case of Hologic only the subtyping of those samples that were positive for FLUAV for the ProFlu+ test was then tested by ProFAST+. Moreover, Allplex RP1 in contrast to both ProFlu+ and GeneXpert also provided information regarding the genetic group of HRSV, distinguishing between group A and group B. The availability of an assay that provides all these information is an excellent option to be used in the laboratory since it reports relevant epidemiological interest information [12]. Nonetheless, in this study the validation parameters for FLUAV-H1 could not be determined because there was no availability of seasonal FLUAV-H1 laboratory-confirmed samples. It is well-known that seasonal FLUAV-H1 does not circulate worldwide since the 2009\u20132010 season but a future circulation of this FLUAV subtyped cannot be discarded in a near future. The availability to detect this target, particularly in a commercial diagnostic method, might help to monitor the re-emergence of this FLUV subtype in the community.",

The whole procedure from NA extraction to results interpretation lasted for less than 5 h per run and needed only 10 min of hands-on time work. The automated process and the minimum hands-on time must be remarked as it can be used in a high-throughput laboratory workflow, minimizing human error risk and NA contaminations, improving the quality control and reducing the laboratory-related costs. In addition, the data interpretation software (Seegene Viewer) is optimized for multiplex assays and detects in a single channel multiple Ct and fluorophores values providing a semi-quantitative information and also minimizing human error, which could occur with higher probability in the interpretation of fluorescent curves in the case of Hologic\u2019s assay.",
