            "text": "Anti nutrients and Inhibitors of Lung Physiology -942 51 Lung disease is far more prevalent worldwide than commonly thought. In fact, death from chronic lung disease is increasing, and as of 2017, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become the third leading cause of death in the United States in the past decade, disproportionately affecting the elderly [1] . Another lung disease, asthma, affects 1 in 13, or about 25 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics [2] . This is 7.6% of adults, more women than men, and 8.4% of children. Asthma is the leading chronic disease in children [3] . This disease has been increasing since the early 1980s in all age, sex, and racial groups. In Europe, lung disease represents 15% of all deaths -the fourth leading cause. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2008, 9.5 million people died from acute or chronic lung disease, representing one sixth of the global total deaths [4] . Worldwide, four respiratory disease categories appear in the top ten leading causes of death in 2010 [5] . Specifically, COPD was the third leading cause of death, followed by lower respiratory infections as the fourth, lung cancer as the fifth, and tuberculosis as the tenth [4] . The major risk factor is smoking, leading to 50% of all lung disease-related deaths in Europe, where smoking is more prevalent (28% prevalence) than in the United States (15% prevalence) by nearly twofold [6, 7] . Lung cancer, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtype, is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [8] . Added together, lung disease rivals the position for the top cause of death.",

Phagocytic macrophages destroy inhaled bacteria and serve an important role in suppressing or activating the immune response to antigens and pathogens, similar to dendritic cells discussed below. Macrophage function has been shown to be inhibited by cigarette smoke [16] . Alveolar macrophages also secrete enzymes, arachidonic acid metabolites, growth factors, immune response components, cytokines, and lymphocytes [17] . Type I cells are responsible for maintaining the structure of the alveolar wall, whereas Type II cells and Clara cells are responsible for the production of pulmonary surfactant (composed of 85-90% lipid and 10-15% protein as lecithin and myelin), which is essential for lung function. The surfactant reduces surface tension, facilitating easier stretching and collapsing of alveoli during respiration [18] . Diseases associated with inadequate surfactant production are acute/adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) [19] . IRDS is seen in premature babies born prior to 32 weeks of gestation due to immature development of pulmonary surfactant, which only begins to develop around the 20th week of gestation [18] . Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol compose the lipid portion of the surfactant, where apoproteins and proteins found in blood plasma compose the protein portion [18, 20] . The importance of cholesterol is minimized in today's medical community. Those with higher levels of cholesterol tend to have more in their fatty cell membranes which resist pathogenesis at a cellular level. Low cholesterol predicts a greater risk of dying from gastrointestinal, neoplastic, or respiratory diseases. It occupies 30-40% of our cell membranes, enhances the mechanical strength of the membrane, and reduces permeability [21] . It suppresses main-phase transition of the lipid bilayer [22] .",

The pulmonary artery supplies carbon dioxide-rich blood to these capillaries within the alveoli to remove carbon dioxide, and the oxygen-rich blood then gets delivered to the heart through the pulmonary vein. The lungs also serve the vital function of maintaining acid-base balance through changes in minute ventilation. These changes affect the pH of the blood by either retaining or excreting carbon dioxide [11] .

However, too little or too much iron can pose a problem for the lungs. Before iron administration, it is important to rule out hemochromatosis, or iron overload, for an individual. Iron-deficiency anemia often presents in many chronic diseases including those of the lung, such as COPD, lung cancer, and IPF [57] . Increased mortality, decreased quality of life, increased hospital admissions, and cost of treatment have been reported for those with chronic disease and low iron [58] . Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is usually at the root of this. ACD is often the result of inflammation. Inflammatory proteins, including IL-6, stimulate the production of hepcidin in the liver, which inhibits absorption and increases storage of iron resulting in a functional iron deficiency. Typical iron markers, such as transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin, are also affected by inflammation and are less useful markers in chronic disease. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTFR) seems to be a lesser known marker that is less affected by inflammation [59] .",

Other carotenoids found in food, such as lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, are not converted to vitamin A but have other antioxidant benefits in the body.

This vitamin also is promising with regard to beneficial effects on lung function preservation. Oxidative stress and inflammation are key features in many lung diseases; therefore nutrients with antioxidant capacity can be useful. A few studies suggest that alpha-tocopherol found in sunflower and olive oils has a beneficial effect on FEV (forced expiratory volume), whereas gamma-tocopherol found in canola, soybean, and corn oils has a negative effect on FEV [81] . However, from these authors' perspective, this is likely due to the source and type of the oils, which can be inflammatory, rather than the form of vitamin E. For example, a recent study showed that gamma-tocopherol was protective in allergic asthma [82] . In addition, sufficient levels of vitamin E, in the alpha-tocopherol form, were found to reduce susceptibility of the elderly to acquiring pneumonia. Some of the positive effects of vitamin E are synergistic with vitamin C [83] .",

            "text": "Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide composed of cysteine, glutamine, and glycine and produced from methionine, is in every cell in the body. It is the most powerful and abundant endogenous antioxidant in the airway epithelial lining and is responsible for detoxification of electrophilic compounds, the scavenging of free radicals, and modulation of cellular processes such as DNA synthesis and repair, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune function [117] . It is also a heavy metal chelator. It is more effective than some other antioxidants because it is intracellular and extracellular. In isolated type II alveolar epithelial cells, extracellular glutathione inhibits hyperoxia-induced injury, inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and promotes cell growth. It is obviously very important to maintaining lung function as this is the inflammatory process that begins lung cell or tissue damage, as mentioned above. The highest levels of glutathione concentrations in the body are in the lungs, liver, and brain. GSH depletion leads to activation of NF-kB (pro-inflammatory signaling) and increased pro-inflammatory gene transcription and cytokine release from histone deacetylase suppression in epithelial cells. Total and reduced GSH concentrations are much lower in people with ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis than observed in healthy adults. Alterations in alveolar and lung GSH metabolism are widely recognized as a central feature of many inflammatory lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and asthma [118] . We make glutathione in the body with cysteine and methionine, and it is difficult to take exogenously because digestion can destroy it. The precursors of cysteine (essential), glutamine, and glycine and cofactors (vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12, folate (B9), minerals selenium, magnesium, and zinc, and alpha-lipoic acid, see below) are therefore recommended so that the body can produce it on its own. The two enzymes necessary to produce it, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase, must also be functioning well. We also recycle glutathione if the precursors and cofactors are available. Cysteine is usually the most rate-limiting precursor, and many people supplement with N-acetylcysteine to provide the body with this nutrient. Although glutathione is produced in every cell of the body, the greatest production is in the liver, so focusing on liver health is important to maintain good glutathione production. Production declines with age and with lung disease, as well as other conditions.",

However, ingested inorganic arsenic is typically biotransformed and excreted in the urine [130] .

A more conventional approach may involve starting the individual on an inhaled corticosteroid or an IgE antagonist (i.e., omalizumab) [159] , rather than identifying the root cause of the patient's symptoms. While medications may be warranted until the trigger is identified, finding the underlying causes may not be common practice in many conventional settings. In contrast, the IFMNT assessment takes a much deeper dive into identifying triggers and any nutrient insufficiencies, inflammation or immune dysregulation, biochemical individuality, lifestyle, energy dysfunction, toxic load, sleep, and stress issues are taken into account. With this information, the practitioner can make more targeted dietary, lifestyle, and supplement recommendations to obtain sustained resolution of symptoms by treating the root cause (. Table 51 ",

Asthmatic patients with high serum periostin tend to be aspirin intolerant, eosinophilic, late asthma onset, and have a high nitric oxide fraction. High periostin can also indicate a reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids [186, 224] .

Individuals with this deficient allele present with AAT levels at less than 35% to low-end normal levels [191] . However, it is also possible for individuals with a variant of this allele to be asymptomatic given different environmental conditions or lifestyle factors, such as refraining from smoking to reduce lung disease development risk [191] (7 Box 51.4).",

There are more than a dozen genetic variants that have been associated with this family of diseases. Researchers now believe at least 20% of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients with multiple family members suffering from IPF have some common familial genetic variants, which may allow researchers to eventually drop the term idiopathic and further define various forms or categories, with differing progression or outcome. The name given to this version of interstitial pneumonias is familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP) [200] [see . Currently two categories of genetic focus have been defined: those genes related to telomere biology (shorter telomeres) and those related to surfactant protein processing. The genes related to shorter telomeres are TERT, TERC, hTR, DKC1, and RTEL1. More mutations have been found in the TERT gene, which encodes the protein component of telomerase, than any other gene. Further research may allow targeted therapies to affect the genetic expression associated with the development of IPF [201, 202] . A common variant within the promoter of the MUC5B gene is the most replicated single-nucleotide polymorphism related to familial and sporadic forms of IPF as well as early radiographic findings of IPF [203] (. Figs. 51.9 and 51.10). Wound contraction and re-epithelialization . Fig. 51.8 The cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis in multiple organs. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis in multiple organs. Once an injury occurs in an organ, epithelial and/or endothelial cells are impaired, which results in the release of chemokines and growth factors, including IL-13 and TGF-b1. Macrophages and monocytes are recruited and activated, both of which further release cytokines and chemokines and further induce fibroblast activation. Activated fibroblasts transform into a-SMA-expressing myofibroblasts and migrate into the wound along the fibrin lattice. ECM is excessively accumulated, and some parenchymal cells (hepatic stellate cells in the liver, tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, alveolar epithelial cells in the lung, or cardiomyocytes in the heart) are further differentiated into myofibroblasts or fibroblasts by the stimulation of cytokines and chemokines, especially for TGF-b1. After the inflammatory phase, two events occur. One is the regeneration of injured tissues followed by wound contraction and reepithelialization. In contrast, once chronic injury, inflammation, and necrosis occur, myofibroblasts are perpetually activated, and excessive ECM is deposited, finally resulting in fibrosis formation.

In the Smad-dependent pathway, TGF-b1 directly phosphorylates and activates the downstream mediator Smad2 and Smad3 through TGF-b receptor I, and then Smad2 and Smad3 bind Smad4, which forms a complex that moves into the nucleus and initiates gene transcription. Smad7, transcribed by Smad3, is a negative regulator of TGF-b/Smad signaling, and the imbalance between Smad3 and Smad7 contributes to fibrosis. PI3K, ERK, and p38 MAPK are downstream mediators of the Smad-independent TGF-b pathway. PPARg [Target (3)] could inhibit TGF-b to reduce fibrosis, while CTGF [Target (4)], a matricellular protein, contributes to wound healing and virtually all fibrotic pathology.

Most research labs use Flow-FISH for research. Telomere length is a hot topic in research, the antiaging industry, and with popular health blogs.

Some include reducing stress, meditation, practicing loving kindness (a technique encouraging compassion) [215] , reducing exposure to air pollution and toxins [216] , cardiovascular exercise [217] , and a healthy fat and high vegetable diet [218, 219] . One study showed that 45 minutes of cardiovascular exercise three times per week resulted in longer telomeres representing 10 years of biological age, similar to those of marathon runners, compared to those who didn't exercise much or at all [220] .

Historically, nutrition has been used in a supportive role, primarily monitoring macronutrients to prevent weight loss, muscle atrophy, and acid/alkaline balance. Although this is extremely important, more attention needs to be directed toward emphasizing micronutrients and phytonutrients. Research is strong regarding the benefits of vitamins, minerals, and pre-and probiotics, and indeed, some integrative and functional practitioners are using vitamin and mineral nutritional therapy in oral, intramuscular, and intravenous applications, when allowed, in practice. A newer area of research is around nutraceuticals, including targeted vitamins, minerals, and plantderived constituents concentrated to therapeutic doses. Some exciting research around the use of curcumin and quercetin, for example, has been shown to dampen inflammation to the point of disrupting the disease process (see above). The expanding knowledge of the microbiome is identifying the importance of the lung and airway microbiome in respiratory health.",

Summary of potential protective micronutrients and phytochemicals in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC). External and internal factors lead to oxidative stress and inflammation and thus initiate COPD and LC pathogenesis. Interventions against external exposure are not satisfying, while targeting the lung microbiome is promising. Recent studies have revealed strong evidence on protective nutrients in DNA methylation and damage, but studies on histone modulation are limited to animal or cell experiments. Epidemiological studies about micronutrients and phytochemicals in later key event lung function impairment are abundant and have identified different intervention patterns, including symptom improvement and a decline rate-reducing pattern.
