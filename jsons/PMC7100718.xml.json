Based on the influence of cytokines on mood, cognition, and behavior in healthy individuals2 and patients with medical and psychiatric conditions,3,4,5 the reciprocal immune\u2013brain interactions,6 and the cytokine expression during allergic reactions, we hypothesized that tree pollen (which peaks in spring) and ragweed pollen (which peaks in late summer/early fall) may act as environmental triggers for suicide in vulnerable individuals. We explored this hypothesis by comparing the suicide rates before, during and after periods of peak atmospheric pollen.",

Raters identified three periods for each allergen in time units of quarter-months at each location for up to 4 years divided as follows: a prepollen period (pollen counts <10 p/m3 for trees and <mid-way on the log scale between 1 and 10 p/m3 for ragweed), a peak-pollen period (>100 p/m3 for trees and >mid-way on the log scale between 10 and 100 p/m3 for ragweed), and a postpollen period when concentrations returned to the prepollen levels.

During the tree allergy season, there was a two-fold increase in the rate of nonviolent suicides among younger females in the peak-pollen period compared with the prepollen period (95% CI=1.3, 3.0) (Table 3). There was no difference between the postpollen period and the prepollen period. In older females, the rate of nonviolent suicide in the postpollen period was 4.6 times that of the prepollen period (95% CI=1.2, 17.8), with no increase in the peak-pollen period relative to the prepollen period (Table 3). It is unlikely that a greater exposure to natural light during the peak-pollen season would have spuriously increased suicide rates in younger women, because a greater suicide rate was found in the peak-pollen period, while a greater \u2018sunshine\u2019 was found in the postpollen period. However, in older women, it is possible that a greater light exposure during the postpollen period could have spuriously inflated the rate of suicide during that period. The differences in the tree pollen period effect between younger and older women may also represent a consequence of aging-related changes in the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems and their reciprocal interactions.",

This sex-specific finding is consistent with the previously reported increased rate of atopy in females and several reports that allergy is associated with both the occurrence and severity of depression in women but not in men.7 Yet, if our hypothesis is correct, why would it be confirmed only for tree pollen and not also for ragweed pollen? Although ragweed is the single most allergenic plant in the US, the allergenic impact of trees is greater, with greater amount of pollen produced over a longer period of exposure, as a result of a successive (partially overlapping) onset of pollination of various tree taxa. An important additional concern is that very few nonviolent suicides were recorded in ragweed season, and since the classification comes from vital statistics data, misclassification could have a large impact on our findings for cells with few events.",

While our result may have been confounded by a number of biological and psychosocial factors (such as impact of feeling sick), acting during the allergy season on individuals and their social support systems, the drug treatments of allergies are particularly relevant. Specifically, over-the-counter medications containing pseudoephedrine may worsen prosuicidal factors such as insomnia, agitation, anxiety, and impulsivity, and antihistamines may cause somnolence and cognitive disturbance. Systemic corticosteroids used for more severe symptoms can precipitate depressive, mixed, or manic episodes. Other confounding seasonal factors that peak during late winter and early spring, such as certain viral infections (corona viruses, influenza),8 may induce inflammation and increased cytokine production in early spring. Alternatively, late winter and early spring decrements in immune defenses8 against neurotropic pathogens9 could also result in seasonal decompensation of mood disorders.",

Several mechanisms that may explain this association are currently under investigation. Further studies are necessary to define environmental factors, which, in interaction with genetic and developmental vulnerability and resilience, may contribute to the seasonal peaks of suicide. This research may contribute to the stress-diathesis concept of depression-induced suicide,10 open new perspectives regarding the environmental precipitants of suicidal behavior, and lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent suicide.",
