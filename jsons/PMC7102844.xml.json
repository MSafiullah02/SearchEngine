The danger of infection is highest for groups of individuals living in close proximity. From the intermittent transmission that occurred in animal-to-human, many human-to-human cases of MERS have also been documented within family and healthcare facilities [1], [2], [3]. Transmission of MERS pathogen can form networks of infected individuals that were connected either directly or indirectly. One should expect in such environments the formation of large clusters of infections as observed during the outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [4] and South Korea (SK) [5]. Cluster size of human-to-human transmissions of MERS has been shown to vary and a high variability and heterogeneity in the transmission potential have been underscored [6], [7].",

By February 2018, a total of 2182 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) [8]. The disease has now spread to over 27 countries with most index patients either residing or recently traveling to areas neighboring the Arabian Peninsula [9], [10]. Similarly, the vast majority of the total cases (82%) occurred in KSA [8]. The global mortality rate was highest (58%) at the beginning of the epidemics (September 2012\u2013February 2013) and it dropped continuously to an absolute low of 23% during September 2015\u2013February 2016. As of February 2018, these infections has led to 779 documented deaths (a mortality rate of 36%) [8]. People within the age-group 50\u201359 years are at the highest risk of being infected as primary cases and have the highest mortality rate [8]. Forty-five day survival rate was lowest in patients older than 65 years (44.86%) [11]. Also, healthcare workers (HCW) are regularly exposed to MERS due to their regular contacts with MERS patients and are at greater risk of being infected; however, they are less likely to die of the disease [10], [12], [13], [14].",

In 2015, cases of MERS were reported in SK when the index patient returned from his trip to the Arabian Peninsula where he had contracted MERS [18]. The disease spread out across various cities in SK within two months, expanding from one to 17 hospitals and infecting a total of 186 people. Similarly, a major MERS outbreak was registered at a tertiary-care hospital in Riyadh in 2015 [4], [17], [21], [22. The escalation of the Riyadh outbreak was linked to extended healthcare-related human-to-human transmissions [4], [17], [21], [22. These outbreaks were attributed to few index cases and the level of their spreading depended on interactions between individuals. For example, 82 out of the 186 infected patients in SK were traced back to one index patient alone due to the overcrowded emergency room with patients, visitors and healthcare worker [23].",

Specifically, we will investigate the effects of place of exposure in the transmission mechanisms of MERS, whether outbreaks in the hospital vs. outbreaks elsewhere in the community have significant differences in the length of hospital stay (LOS).

The data sets were also assessed for accuracy with those reported by Flu Trackers, KSA MoH and WHO. The data contains information on patient demographics, clinical outcome, whether the patient was a healthcare worker (HCW), comorbidity status of the patient, and place of exposure to known risk factors. We used the following approaches to estimate length of hospital stay (LOS): (1) we restricted our analysis to those patients who are still alive and those that died within 60 days for short-time risk of death analysis (2) LOS was calculated as the difference between the date of onset of disease (or date reported whenever date of onset was not available) and date of death/discharged.",

A network can be defined as a collection of nodes connected by edges where nodes and/or edges have attributes [28]. Each patient (node) was assigned a unique identification number and his/her contact history was tracked within 14 days of the onset of the disease. MERS patients who were in contact with other laboratory-confirmed MERS patients were identified and a list of each patient-contact pair (dyad) was prepared. A dyad is a linked pair of patients (nodes) in the network that is the fundamental unit for deriving network metrics. The outbreak network visualization and network analysis were conducted in UCINET 6.0 Version 1.00 [29]. The following centrality metrics were used to measure the structural importance of patients (nodes) in a network. \u201cDegree centrality\u201d was used to reveal the most active nodes in the network and how well a node is connected with its neighbours \u2014 a node degree is the number of edge incidents on a node; the \u201cbetweenness centrality\u201d was used to measure how many pairs of nodes a node can be connected to through a shortest path while \u201ceigenvector centrality\u201d was used to measure the importance of a node depending on the importance of its neighbours [27], [29].",

Our results suggest that healthcare workers have on average significantly lower degree centrality scores than non-healthcare workers.

Older people seem to have been statistically more exposed to the disease at healthcare facilities than at other places which might be the result of a combination of senior people been admitted to the hospital more frequently due to their advanced age and having less active social interactions than younger people. This is consistent with previous findings that the chances of dying from the MERS grew with increasing age beyond 25 years [10]. It also confirms the common assumption that the danger of infection is greater for senior patients and, therefore, special attention needs to be paid to them.",

The length of hospital stay has been investigated from various perspectives both medical and economical [39], [40], [41], [42]. Our result is in accordance with Glance et al. [43], who showed that the length of hospital stay, associated costs and mortality rate of hospital-acquired infections were significantly higher for trauma patients.

Health care workers are often in compliance with risk management approaches to reduce and control transmission of MERS by wearing protective gears and are aware of other hygienic measures, to reduce the dose of infectious agents preventing further spread of the disease. In the same vein, hospitalized patients played the role of an epidemic amplifier, i.e. they played more the role of transmitters. This complements an earlier publication showing that the vast majority of documented MERS patients had contacts with other patients in healthcare facilities and that nosocomial infections occurred more often in outbreak than non-outbreak cases [15], [16].",

Firstly, this analysis was based on retrospective study of publicly available data collected from multiple sources; the accuracy of some of the information provided by the patient may not be verifiable especially during the early outbreaks. However, the reporting has been improved upon over the years with coordination between Saudi government agencies and WHO. The data sets were also assessed for accuracies with those reported by Flu Trackers, Saudi MOH and WHO. Secondly, the network analysis considered in this study was solely based on confirmed MERS cases with strict directionality; therefore, unconfirmed cases will be missed. Similarly, we restricted our analysis to those with known contact history to be able to differentiate the source of infection and construct the transmission network. In spite of these limitations, analysis based on network analysis offers very interesting findings on the distribution of secondary cases caused by each primary case. Lastly, lack of information on hospitals prevented us from exploring the spread of MERS between hospitals.",

The mechanisms of the transmission and the structure of the networks need to be well-understood in order to optimize preventive measures, and have reliable early warning systems as well as effective treatment methods. The outcomes of our research emphasize the importance of putting patients with communicable diseases, especially life-threatening diseases, immediately under quarantine and minimizing the access of healthcare workers to such patients. Such precautionary measures could be lifesaving, in particular for patients with comorbidities and/or of senior age who need to be observed closer during their entire hospital stay. Moreover, healthcare workers should be advised on their potential role as hubs for pathogens due to the nature of their occupation. Loose adherences to preventive and protective measures by the health care workers should be identified and immediately corrected in order to avoid the negative role they may play in transmitting the agent.",
