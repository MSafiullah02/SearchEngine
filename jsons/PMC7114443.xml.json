Their genomes range approximately from 27- to 32-kb in length and contain 7\u201314 open reading frames (ORFs) (Woo et al., 2009a). Six major ORFs encoding polymerase complex (ORF1a and ORF1b), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) are present in all CoVs (Poon et al., 2005). In addition, up to seven putative accessory ORFs and one ORF encoding hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE) are interspersed between the six major ORFs. The numbers and sizes of these accessory ORFs differ markedly among CoVs (Woo et al., 2009a).",

            "text": "CoVs have been identified from a broad range of birds and mammals including humans in which they can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurologic diseases of varying severity (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). CoVs in the subfamily Coronavirinae are classified into three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (former serogroups 1\u20133) (de Groot et al., 2011). Alpha- and beta-coronaviruses have been exclusively isolated from mammals and majority of gamma-coronaviruses from birds. CoVs of a distinctive lineage were recently detected from birds and pigs (Chu et al., 2011, Woo et al., 2009b, Woo et al., 2012) and have been proposed to belong to a new genus, provisionally named Deltacoronavirus (de Groot et al., 2011). The finding that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in early 2003 was caused by a novel CoV (SARS-CoV) has boosted interest in the search for novel CoVs in humans and animals. At least 30 previously unrecognized distinctive CoVs from human and various animal reservoirs were reported during recent years, including SARS-related CoVs and CoVs from all genera in the subfamily Coronavirinae which have significantly expanded our understanding of CoV diversity and complexity (Woo et al., 2009a). Based on available data, bats appear to harbor a great diversity of CoVs. The frequency and diversity of CoV detection in bats, now in multiple continents, suggest that bats are likely a source for CoV introduction into other species globally and possibly play an important role in the ecology and evolution of CoVs.",

These newly discovered bat CoVs were grouped into 8 different phylogenetic clusters. Of these, five clusters belonged to previously identified Alphacoronavirus genus, and three clusters belonged to previously identified Betacoronavirus genus, including a SARS-related CoV lineage. In the present study, we expand our sequence data for seven CoVs, representing 7 of the 8 distinctive clusters we identified in Kenya bats during 2006 summer (Tong et al., 2009). The sample representing the eighth cluster of a SARS-related CoV was a weak positive and had limited specimen amount, therefore further sequencing studies were not included in this analysis. The purpose of our study was to further characterize the genomes and refine the phylogenetic relationships of these seven CoVs with other CoVs, based on the ORFs 1b, S, E, M, and N.",

Therefore the RT-PCR-amplicon sequencing by Sanger chain-termination method was chosen in this study. Each of the seven contiguous sequences was obtained by using 4\u20136 pairs of semi-nested or nested consensus degenerate group specific primers and 4\u20137 pairs of semi-nested or nested sequence-specific bridging primers which generated a series of 8\u201313 overlapping fragments covering 15\u201316kb genomic sequences at the 3\u2032 end (Table S1). The other half genome sequence containing the ORF1a, was not recovered in this analysis due to the limited amount of rectal swab samples. Consensus degenerate primers of each group were designed from conserved sequences of known members of the corresponding sequence group or its close group based on CODEHOP strategy (Rose et al., 1998). The 3\u2032 end of genome sequence was determined using the 3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semi-nested or nested primers were used to improve the PCR sensitivity. When nested primers were not available, the PCR product was re-amplified using the same RT-PCR primers. The RT-PCR reactions were performed with SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the second round RCR reactions were performed with AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The RT-PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels containing 0.5 \u03bcg/mL of ethidium bromide, and purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Santa Clarita, CA). The RT-PCR amplicons for each sample were first sequenced with the consensus degenerate RT-PCR primers in both directions, and then the remaining internal gaps and 3\u2032 end genome were sequenced with sequence-specific bridging primers in both directions as described previously. The genomic sequences (ORF1b, S, ORF3, E, M, and N) of BtKY22, BtKY33, BtKY27, BtKY41, BtKY43, BtKY06, and BtKY24 were deposited in NCBI GenBank (HQ728480\u2013HQ728486).",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, spike proteins of the seven bat CoVs lack furin protease recognition site, such as RRADR-S in Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), RRSRG-A in human CoV OC43 (HCoV OC43), RRSRR-A in bovine CoV (BCoV) (Follis et al., 2006), and cathepsin L cleavage site (VAYT-M) as in SARS-CoV (Bosch et al., 2008). In spite of lacking conserved cleavage sites, they all consist of two domains, S1 and S2, showing the conserved GxCx motif in S1 around the cleavage site and the conserved nonamer motif IPTNFSISI or similar motif in S2. These motifs have been observed in other known CoVs (Follis et al., 2006). The S1 is responsible for virus binding to the receptor on the target cells and may contain receptor binding domains (RBDs) that directly bind to host cellular receptors. For example, the RBDs of HCoV 229E, TGEV, and HCoV NL63 in Alphacoronavirus are mapped at the C terminus of their S1 domain (Bonavia et al., 2003, Godet et al., 1994, Lin et al., 2008). The RBDs of MHV and SARS-CoV in Betacoronavirus are mapped at N terminus and central region of S1 domain, respectively (Li et al., 2005, Lin et al., 2008). Alignment of aa sequences of S1 regions from BtKY22, BtKY27, BtKY33, BtKY41, and BtKY43 of Alphacoronavirus with the corresponding known RBD S1 regions of HCoV 229E, TGEV, and HCoV NL 63 showed 33\u201341% identity in S1 RBD domains to HCoV 229E and 24\u201329% identity to TGEV and HCoV NL63 (Fig. S1A\u2013C). BtKY24 and BtKY06 from Betacoronavirus are quite different in the corresponding RBD S1 regions from SARS-CoV and MHV (17\u201319% identity) (Fig. S1D\u2013E). The dissimilarity of S1 regions of these bat CoVs to other CoVs may suggest their different host specificity.",

The phylogeny of E gene is not shown due to the short length and limited value for inferring species phylogenies. Similar topologies were observed in the phylogenetic trees based on each of 5 ORFs (Fig. 3). The analysis revealed that among the seven bat CoVs, five belonged to Alphacoronavirus while the other two belonged to Betacoronavirus (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic clusterings within Alphacoronavirus varied slightly when different genes were analyzed. For example, BtKY22 and BtKY43 grouped into one monophyletic clade in ORF1b tree while they were grouped differently in the S and N gene trees with generally insignificant bootstrap values (Fig. 3). Although recombination was suspected, we found no evidence of recombination in the seven analyzed viruses using MaxChi (Smith, 1992), Chimaera (Posada et al., 2002), and Geneconv (Padidam et al., 1999). Since the analyses were based on representatives from each CoV species, the results suggest a lack of inter-species recombination in these viruses. One explanation is that the recombination frequency decreases significantly when the sequence divergence is high (Kleiboeker et al., 2005, van Vugt et al., 2001). Alternatively, the lack of inter-specie recombination is due to rare co-infections as the viruses adapted to different bats species. Therefore, the phylogenetic incongruence observed in the gene trees is probably due to low phylogenetic signals, which may be improved by sampling more CoVs that are related to BtKY22 and BtKY43.",

The four clusters of Kenya bat CoVs represented by BtKY22, BtKY41, BtKY43, and BtKY24 respectively, most likely belonged to novel CoV species, the two clusters represented by BtKY27 and BtKY33 were likely members of Bat-CoV 1A, and the cluster represented by BtKY06 was likely a member of Bat-CoV HKU9 species. As noted with other novel CoVs, the genome organization is similar but differences were found in the number of putative ORFs downstream from the ORF N. The present results are in line with previous findings of extensive diversity of CoVs detected in bats and confirm that bat CoVs mainly belong to the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera (Lau et al., 2005, Lau et al., 2007, Tang et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2009b). Consistent with other reports, none of the bat CoVs characterized in the present study was sufficiently similar to the human SARS-CoV and other human CoVs to be suggested their direct progenitors. The examples of host switching among CoVs after relatively minor sequence changes in S1 domain of spike protein (Haijema et al., 2003, Kuo et al., 2000, Qu et al., 2005) suggest the potential risks for introduction into humans as occurred with SARS-CoV. Therefore characterization of novel CoVs and understanding species diversity in animals should help understand and respond to emerging zoonotic infections.",
