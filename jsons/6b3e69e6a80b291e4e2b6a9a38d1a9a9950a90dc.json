We consider the particular case of an infection which primarily spreads among people through proximal contact, via respiratory droplets. This smartphone application will be able to detect other devices in close proximity and list all the interactions in an anonymous and encrypted way. If an app user is tested positive and so is certified as infected, the application notifies immediately the potential contagion to the devices in the list and suggests to start a voluntary quarantine and undergo a medical test. We believe this solution may be particularly useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic and moreover could be used to prevent similar events in the future.",

            "text": "What we can learn from the recent COVID-19 pandemic is that we were not ready for this kind of eventuality. [1] Our society has reached a level of global interconnection which makes an epidemic outbreak an event very problematic to contain with traditional quarantine measures. This means that a very contagious disease can easily spread around the globe putting health care systems under pressure, especially in countries where such systems are already in precarious conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to find a way to effectively limit pandemics as soon as possible. Nowadays, especially in the most technologically developed areas, a vast majority of people own a smartphone and have it constantly with themselves. This type of behavior is typical of our current lifestyle and can represent an advantage to contain the epidemic outbreak. An infectious disease primarily spreads among people due to their proximity, via respiratory droplets coming from coughs and sneezes or via direct contact. [3] In order to slow down the outbreak, the best procedure is to immediately identify the \"patient zero\" and quarantine those who have come into contact with them. [4] The recent outbreak of COVID-19 showed that this approach is difficult to pursue and unsustainable when the incubation period is long, because of the high number of Email address: mk.urbani.89@gmail.com (Michele Urbani) interactions and the lack of strategies to efficiently warn the people who could have gotten infected. The absence of an efficient method to track the spread of the epidemic may translate into an exponential growth of cases, and this, in turn, might lead to a pandemic which is hard to contain without severe restrictions on people's freedom. We propose a relatively simple but powerful tool, based on an smartphone application, to statistically slow down and contain an epidemic outbreak. The main idea is to treat each \"positive patient\" like the \"patient zero\" using a smartphone contact tracing strategy. This approach can be called \"selective quarantine\" and contrasts with the \"traditional quarantine\" which consists in isolating a geographical area (see Fig1) . This smartphone application should be able to track other devices in close proximity and to encrypt all the interactions into an anonymous \"proximal contact list\". In the case where a patient is infected, the medical authority provides a key to activate the app, which sends automatic notifications to the devices on the list, warning about the possible contagion.",

            "text": "The crucial feature of Proximity is the tracking of neighboring devices. This must occur offline and with high accuracy, for the measurement of the distance. The former requirement will ensure the users' privacy, as all the information will be stored locally in the device, in an encrypted form. Moreover, it will allow the app to operate even if the connection to the network is missing or weak. The range accuracy is crucial, in order to avoid having a large number of false alerts. With false alerts we mean devices recorded in the proximal contact list, which were out of the infection range (i.e. the maximum distance at which one can be infected by proximity). Clearly the closer the tracking range is to the infection range, the higher the identification accuracy of potentially infected people will be. We identified the Bluetooth technology as the most suitable option to satisfy the app's needs. Bluetooth allows for the direct communication of one device with multiple others, even out of the line-of-sight, thus enabling simultaneously tracking of multiple smartphones within the selected range. Furthermore, it is designed for low power consumption, enabling the app to be constantly active, without draining the battery. Another crucial parameter is the working range, in order to provide the required accuracy. Current Bluetooth (Class 2) devices operating on mobile phones have a range of about 10 meters [5] , variable depending on the presence of obstacles along the path, which can attenuate the signal. The infection range is usually on the order of a few meters, so Bluetooth antennas are a viable tool for this application. [5] One potentially interesting alternative to Bluetooth, would be Near Field Communication (NFC). This is a pretty recent technology implemented in most novel devices, which allows for radio communication on very short distances, used for example for wireless payments. This is promising for Proximity since it is a very low power consuming technology. [6] The drawback is the range, which currently is in the order of few centimeters, thus making it unsuitable for our app, for the moment.",

People who had longer interactions with an infected individual, will have a higher probability of incurring in the infection themselves, as well as people who have been much closer to an infected person. Once the priority is set, it is used to order the proximal contact list. At this point, it is possible to proceed by defining a threshold, taking into account for instance the capacity of the health care system to perform tests for the detection of the infection. This way, if the number of people who can potentially receive the alert is higher than such threshold, then the individuals with lower priority are excluded from the list. They can, for example, be held in a waiting list, and alerted at a subsequent time.",

The second notification, yellow notification, can be activated by a person who has received the red notification, but not been tested yet. The yellow notification is sent to the proximal contact list of this second individual. In the latter case, the alert must contain indications that are different compared to those sent with the red notification. For example, the app would only advise to take precautions but it would not request the medical examination, unless a further red notification is received. We recognize that this last solution might not always be possible or beneficial, because it could, for example, create more confusion in people receiving different alerts.
