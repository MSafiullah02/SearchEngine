Examination of the cardiovascular system (heart, peripheral pulse, and mucous membranes), lungs, and abdomen is essential to detect clinical signs of systemic inflammation from endotoxemia, coagulation disorders, dehydration, ileus, shock, and other abnormalities resulting from injury to the small or large intestine. Clinical signs of systemic inflammation from endotoxemia and sepsis are described later in this chapter.",

Progressive motility of the small intestine, conversely, is difficult to distinguish by auscultation from nonprogressive motility. The distinct character of the borborygmi produced during propulsive contractions of the cecum and ascending colon allows evaluation of the frequency and strength of retropulsion and propulsion. Propulsive contractions of the cecum and ventral colon occur every 3 to 4 minutes and give rise to prolonged rushing sounds heard over long segments of intestine. Retropulsive sounds presumably are similar to propulsive sounds, but they occur less frequently. Distinguishing between propulsion and retropulsion is not important clinically because both types of contractions signify normal motility. Interhaustral and intrahaustral mixing contractions produce nonspecific sounds of fluid and ingesta movement that are difficult to distinguish from other borborygmi, such as small intestinal contractions or spasmodic contractions.1\n",

Auscultation over a similar area on the left side allows evaluation of the pelvic flexure and ascending colon. Typical progressive borborygmi heard every 3 to 4 minutes on both sides of the abdomen indicate normal motility of the cecum and ascending colon. Less frequent progressive sounds may indicate a pathologic condition of the large intestine or may result from anorexia, nervousness (sympathetic tone), or pharmacologic inhibition of motility (i.e., \u03b12-adrenergic agonists such as xylazine).2, 3, 4, 5 Absolute absence of any auscultable borborygmi suggests abnormal motility and indicates ileus resulting from a serious pathologic condition but is not specific to any segment of the intestine.3, 6 If borborygmi are audible but progressive sounds are not detectable, determining whether a significant abnormality exists is difficult, and such findings should not be overinterpreted.6 Borborygmi heard more frequently than normal may result from increased motility following feeding; from excessive stimulation from irritation, distention, or inflammation; or after administration of parasympathomimetic drugs such as neostigmine. Large intestinal motility increases in the early stages of intestinal distention regardless of the site.7 Mild inflammation or irritation of the large intestinal mucosa also can stimulate motility.3 Parasympathomimetic drugs stimulate contractions and auscultable borborygmi in the large intestine; an increase in parasympathetic tone may result in segmental contractions, which actually inhibit progressive motility.2\n",

            "text": "Transrectal palpation is the most specific physical examination technique for investigation of intestinal disease and is particularly valuable when evaluating obstructive diseases.8 The primary objectives of transrectal palpation are to assess the size, consistency, and position of the segments of the large intestine; to determine the presence of any distention of the small intestine; and to detect intraabdominal masses. Evaluation of the wall thickness and texture and the mesenteric structures (blood and lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes) also may aid in diagnosis of large intestinal disease. The interpretation of transrectal palpation findings in light of clinical signs and laboratory results is an important diagnostic aid for developing appropriate treatment strategies for intestinal diseases manifested by abdominal pain. Enlargement of one or more segments of large intestine detected by transrectal palpation provides evidence of obstruction at or distal to the enlarged segment. By systematically evaluating each segment, the site of obstruction may be determined. Obstruction of the pelvic flexure, for instance, results in enlargement of the pelvic flexure and ventral colon, but the dorsal and descending colons are of normal size. Enlargement of a segment of the large intestine usually is accompanied by abnormal consistency of the contents. It is possible to distinguish among gas, fluid, and ingesta and to detect foreign bodies in palpable segments. Accumulation of gas and fluid suggests complete and acute obstruction, whereas accumulation of ingesta suggests chronic and incomplete obstruction. Accumulation of fluid usually indicates ileus. The practitioner must evaluate the consistency of the contents in light of the size of the segment; ingesta in the ventral colon of a dehydrated patient may be firm, but the size of the ventral colon will be normal. Conversely, if the ingesta is firm because of a distal obstruction, the ventral colon will be enlarged.",

Torsion of the ascending colon at the sternal and diaphragmatic flexures results in acute accumulation of gas and fluid proximal to the torsion, causing distention of the left dorsal and ventral colons. Depending on the degree of torsion, the position of the ventral and dorsal colons may not be significantly abnormal. Displacement of a segment of large intestine often results in incomplete obstruction, and the diagnosis is either confirmed on detection of the displaced segment in an abnormal position or suspected when the segment is not palpable in a normal position. A determination should be made as to whether the segment that appears to be displaced is in a normal position but of smaller than normal size because of a decreased volume of ingesta. The cecum, right dorsal and ventral colons, pelvic flexure, and descending colon are palpable in most horses. The nephrosplenic space should be palpated to detect the presence of intestine, usually pelvic flexure, entrapped within the ligament.",

Intraluminal masses caused by lymphoma, eosinophilic enteritis, foreign bodies, or ascarid impactions often lead to small intestinal distention and are usually indistinguishable from one another on the basis of palpation alone. Small intestine in these cases can be moderately to severely distended, depending on the degree of obstruction. Extraluminal obstructions include abdominal masses and large colon displacement. The rest of the abdomen should be carefully palpated to help rule out these causes. Some cases of small intestinal distention result from physiologic ileus rather than mechanical obstruction.

Large volumes (\u22658\u201310 L) of foul-smelling fluid may indicate proximal enteritis. Horses with strangulating obstructions or luminal obstructions often accumulate moderate amounts of gastric fluid, but the amount is generally less than in horses with proximal enteritis or postoperative ileus (POI).

Quantitation of clostridial species may be beneficial in diagnosing clostridial infection of the large intestine, although tests to detect clostridial toxins in intestinal contents or feces are important for determining whether clostridia cultured from the feces are causing disease. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated from the feces of horses are Salmonella spp. and Clostridium spp. The number of Salmonella organisms isolated from the feces of horses with clinical salmonellosis is usually higher than from horses with asymptomatic infections. However, the volume of feces in many cases of acute diarrhea is high, and the concentration of Salmonella organisms may be lower than would be expected, accounting for many false-negative fecal cultures. The sensitivity of fecal cultures for detecting Salmonella infection may be as low as 20%. Culture of five consecutive daily fecal samples is recommended to increase the sensitivity of the test. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays used on fecal samples can detect DNA from Salmonella spp. and have performed well in recent validation studies; accuracy of point-of-care tests remains elusive.32, 33, 34, 35 Currently, PCR assays can be used for detection of viral (rotavirus and coronavirus), bacterial (Cryptosporidium spp., Salmonella spp., Neorickettsia risticii, Lawsonia intracellularis), or bacterial toxin (Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A) DNA in feces or blood (N. risticii).",

Thoracic radiographs may be necessary to detect megaesophagus or cranial mediastinal masses causing extraluminal obstruction. Barium swallows or double-contrast esophagrams may be used after resolution of an esophageal obstruction to determine whether a stricture, diverticulum, or other underlying disorder is present, although endoscopy can provide similar information. Barium sulfate is the usual contrast medium and can be administered orally by way of a dose syringe or nasogastric tube (50\u2013100 mL of a 40% barium sulfate suspension or barium paste). Oral administration is preferred for evaluation of swallowing and lesions in the proximal esophagus. Administration of contrast using a nasogastric tube (preferably cuffed) allows for delivery of larger volumes of barium (up to 500 mL) but should be performed without sedation if possible. Administration of contrast material can be followed with air insufflation to create a double-contrast effect. If rupture of the esophagus is suspected or if the contrast material is likely to be aspirated, barium should be avoided, and iodinated organic compounds in an aqueous solution should be used as contrast material to decrease the potential for adverse effects. When interpreting esophageal radiographs, the veterinarian should take particular care if the horse is sedated. Acepromazine or detomidine administration causes esophageal dilation in normal horses, especially after passage of a nasogastric tube.36\n",

Evaluation of the large colon and cecum should include estimation of mural thickening or increased fluidity of contents, and whether or not the colon obscures viewing of the left kidney in the left paralumbar fossa. It is important to remember that other causes of colonic distention can have the same result; thus, it is always important to combine physical, rectal, and ultrasonographic examination findings for any given case. Sand impactions may appear as hyperechoic bands on the ventral abdominal wall,47 but according to the author and others,46 ultrasound does not allow for consistent diagnosis of sand accumulation. Evaluation of the abdomen always should include assessment of the peritoneal space for any evidence of an increased amount or echogenicity of PF. Ultrasonography also can be useful in determining the ideal location for abdominocentesis.",

Such an association has been reported secondary to clostridial enteritis in the foal.40 In horses, lactase activity peaks at birth and declines slowly, such that activity is approximately 50% at 2 years of age and rapidly decelerates after 3 years of age, and it is barely detectable by 4 years of age.41 The oral lactose tolerance test is performed in foals after a 4-hour fast, with a standard dose of 1 g/kg lactose monohydrate given via nasogastric tube as a 20% solution.

Although the cellular and vascular response and the secreted mediators of inflammation are important for killing pathogens and limiting invasion of injured tissues by commensal organisms, they can be quite damaging to host cells and proteins if not tightly regulated. If the inciting stimulus is not eliminated quickly, then the inflammatory response itself will cause significant tissue injury.

Pattern recognition receptors recognize microbial molecules such as LPS, lipoproteins, flagellin, peptidoglycan, and nucleic acids to signal the invasion by pathogens.86 Of the pattern recognition receptors, the LPS receptor complex is perhaps the best defined. LPS activates macrophages by way of the CD14 Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) complex to initiate transcription of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which synergize with LPS to amplify the macrophage response.86 LPS, particularly in concert with inflammatory cytokines, stimulates macrophages to produce copious amounts of nitric oxide, which is both microbicidal and vasoactive.90 Nitric oxide and other nitrogen radicals react with reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) generated by the activated oxidase complex to produce some of the most toxic molecules of the host defense system: the peroxynitrites.90 IL-8 is produced as well to recruit neutrophils. As the response progresses, other inflammatory mediators, particularly the arachidonic acid\u2013derived lipids dependent on inflammation-induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and 5-lipoxygenase activity, are produced that have potent vasoactive and proinflammatory effects through the activation of endothelial cells, neutrophils, and platelets.91\n",

As neutrophils flow through these vessels, they are first tethered to activated endothelium.

Integrin ligation to ICAMs arrests the tethered neutrophils, resulting in firm adhesion to the endothelium.

Calves and people with the disorder leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) illustrate the requirement for \u03b22-integrin\u2013mediated adhesion in neutrophil function. LAD is a result of an autosomal recessive trait resulting in the lack of the \u03b22-integrin expression.

The changing composition of the matrix proteins deposited in tissues during inflammation serves as a clue as to the nature of the tissue environment for recruited inflammatory cells as they become activated. Individual gene expression studies have demonstrated that adhesion to matrix proteins induces the expression of cytokines and chemokines and their receptors, arachidonic acid\u2013derived lipid mediator synthases, metalloproteinases, growth factors, transcription factors, and other genes that influence the differentiation and activation of inflammatory cells.115 ROI production, phagocytosis, degranulation, and other effector functions stimulated by inflammatory mediators and bacterial products are optimal only when neutrophils are adherent to the ECM.114 Adhesion to distinct ECM proteins selectively activates signaling pathways and gene expression of neutrophils, monocytes, and other leukocytes with differing abilities to promote certain functions such that the composition of ECM in many ways controls the development of the ultimate effector phenotype.

Activation of the complement cascade, either by immune complexes (classical pathway) or by bacteria or bacterial products, polysaccharides, viruses, fungi, or host cells (alternative pathway), results in the deposition of complement proteins on the activating surface and the release of soluble proteolytic fragments of several complement components.130 In particular, activation of either pathway results in the deposition of various fragments of the complement protein C3, which are potent activators of neutrophils and monocytes.130 Opsonization of particles with C3 fragments constitutes a major mechanism of target recognition and phagocyte activation.131 During the activation of the complement cascade culminating in deposition of C3, soluble fragments of C3 (C3a), C5 (C5a), and C4 (C4a) are liberated. These fragments, termed anaphylatoxins, have potent effects on tissues and cells during inflammation. Perhaps most notably, they are chemotactic for neutrophils (particularly C5a), activate neutrophil and mast cell degranulation, and stimulate reactive oxygen metabolite release from neutrophils.130 The termination of the complement cascade results in the formation of a membrane attack complex in membranes at the site of complement activation. If this occurs on host cells such as endothelium, the cell may be irreversibly injured. Although the primary source of complement is plasma, epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract also produce C3, suggesting that local production and activation of the complement cascade during inflammation occurs in intestinal tissues.",

Reactive nitrogen intermediates, produced primarily by macrophages during inflammation, combine with ROIs to form peroxynitrites, which are particularly toxic.90 In addition to injury to mucosal tissues, ROIs also have an as yet ill-defined role in recruiting and activating neutrophils, potentiating the inflammatory response.146 In support of the role of ROIs in inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, administration of inhibitors of ROI production or pharmacologic ROI scavengers can be protective in many models of reperfusion injury or enterocolitis. Many therapies are aimed at inhibiting neutrophil activation, and effector functions in tissues have been evaluated for use in intestinal diseases. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, by causing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in neutrophils, are antiinflammatory by virtue of their ability to suppress neutrophil activation and ROI production.

However, many cases of human and animal diarrhea have a speculative or unknown diagnosis or no diagnosis. Irrespective of the underlying or initiating cause of colonic injury, the colon apparently has a limited repertoire of responses to damage because most forms of colitis demonstrate similarities in histopathologic appearance and clinical presentation. Various degrees of mucosal erosion and ulceration, submucosal/mucosal edema, goblet cell depletion, and the presence of an inflammatory cellular infiltrate within the mucosa and submucosa are common to many types of human and animal colitis.163, 164 Characteristic clinical manifestations include intraluminal fluid sequestration; abdominal discomfort; hypovolemia; and most often profuse, watery diarrhea.",

Products of cell activation stimulate direct and indirect secretory responses in intestinal cells and tissues.169, 170 Products of phagocyte secretion may amplify the inflammatory signal or have effects on other target cells in intestine such as enterocytes and smooth muscle cells.",

The result is reduced clearance of bacteria from the large intestine, which may contribute to the virulence of the organism.213 Absorption of endotoxin and the release of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins disrupts the motility patterns of the large intestine, resulting in less coordinated contractions, and may contribute to the alterations in motility seen with invasive bacteria. Although the effect of endotoxin and prostaglandins on transit time is not profound, the disruption of coordinated activity may play a role in causing diarrhea.214 Thorough mixing and prolonged retention time of ingesta are important not only in microbial digestion of nutrients but also in absorption of microbial byproducts and fluid.171 The ingesta is viscous and therefore must be mixed to bring luminal ingesta in contact with the mucosa for absorption. In addition, poor mixing increases the thickness of the unstirred layer, decreasing contact of ingesta with the mucosa and decreasing absorption.171\n",

            "text": "The initiating event in the pathophysiology of endotoxemia is the activation of LPS-responsive cells by endotoxin, resulting in altered cellular functions and increased expression of inflammatory mediators. Immune cells such as macrophages respond to minute amounts of LPS, which usually allows them to eliminate gram-negative bacteria and free LPS molecules efficiently. An important factor in the exquisite sensitivity to LPS is the presence of LPS-binding protein (LBP).220 LBP is an approximately 60-kDa plasma glycoprotein242 synthesized primarily by hepatocytes243 and belongs to the family of lipid transfer/LBPs. LBP is an acute phase protein, and inflammatory agents and cytokines such as IL-1 increase LBP plasma concentration 10- to 100-fold within 24 to 48 hours of an inflammatory stimulus.244, 245 The main function of LBP is to transfer LPS to endotoxin-responsive cells, which include mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. The importance of a highly sensitive response to LPS for protection against gram-negative bacterial infection is demonstrated in experiments using LBP knockout mice\u2014that is, mice that lack the LBP gene and are therefore unable to synthesize LBP. Although these animals are resistant to the effects of purified LPS, they are unable to control infection with viable bacteria and rapidly succumb.246 Despite its crucial importance for an effective host defense, LBP is not essential for LPS-receptor interaction per se, because high concentrations of LPS can activate cells in the absence of LBP.247\n",

IKK activates the well-described transcription factor NF-\u03ba\u03b2 by phosphorylating an inhibitor protein complex (I\u03baB) that sequesters and inactivates NF-\u03ba\u03b2 in the cytoplasm. On phosphorylation I\u03baB is ubiquitinated and degraded, and NF-\u03ba\u03b2 is translocated to the nucleus, in which it unfolds its activity.266 The MyD88-independent pathway, on the other hand, is activated by interaction of TLR4 with the adaptor protein Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF). Although the MyD88-independent pathway also activates MAPK and NF-\u03ba\u03b2 (in addition to a transcription factor called IRF3), this pathway primarily results in activation of type I interferons, which are important for antiviral and antibacterial responses.265 Despite the characterization of seemingly separate and \u201cordered\u201d pathways, one should recognize that interaction and synergy between pathways are likely to occur.

            "text": "Although endotoxin can exert some direct effects, cytokines are a primary mediator of LPS effects. Cytokines are glycoprotein molecules that regulate inflammatory and immune responses by acting as a signal between cells.267 Cytokines of major interest in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia include TNF-\u03b1, the interleukins, chemokines, and growth factors such as granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor. TNF-\u03b1 is thought of as the most \u201cproximal\u201d cytokine released in response to LPS. Studies corroborate this by showing that administration of recombinant TNF-\u03b1 mimics the effects of LPS268 and that antibodies directed against TNF-\u03b1 protect against the lethal effects of endotoxin.269 Increased plasma activity of TNF is associated with increased mortality in equine patients with acute gastrointestinal disease and in septic neonates.231 Despite being a structurally diverse group of proteins, cytokines share several characteristics that allow them to execute their complex functions in the inflammatory response.267 Any individual cytokine generally is produced by several different cell types, can act on different cell types, and has multiple effects on any given cell. Furthermore, cytokine effects are redundant, meaning that different cytokines can share the same effect. In endotoxemia this is particularly true for the effects of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1.270 Many of the biologic activities of cytokines in vivo result from synergistic or antagonistic actions involving two or more cytokines.271 Within itself the cytokine response is highly regulated: cytokines induce or suppress synthesis of other cytokines, including their own (feedback regulation); regulate expression of cytokine receptors; and regulate cytokine activities. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the release of specific cytokine inhibitors such as soluble IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 receptors; cytokine receptor antagonists such as the IL-1 receptor antagonist; and antiinflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-4, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Glucocorticoids, which are produced increasingly in response to endotoxin, also inhibit the production of cytokines.272 During a \u201ccontrolled\u201d inflammatory response, therefore, cytokine secretion is a self-limited event, whereas excessive stimulation of cytokine production can lead to the perpetuation of the inflammatory response even after the initial stimulus has been removed. Aberrations from the controlled, self-regulated inflammatory response have been described as predominantly proinflammatory (SIRS), antiinflammatory or hypoinflammatory (compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome [CARS]), or combined (mixed antagonist response syndrome) responses.273 That these responses may not represent a continuum in response to infection was demonstrated in a recent study investigating cytokine profiles in an experimental model of sepsis.274 Here, increased plasma concentration of antiinflammatory mediators such as IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10 in the early phase of sepsis predicted early mortality almost as accurately as the typical proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Cytokine profiles failed to predict mortality in the later stages of sepsis, thereby suggesting that late outcome is not \u201cpreprogrammed\u201d early on in the disease. A progression from proinflammatory (SIRS) to antiinflammatory (CARS), as previously proposed, could not be demonstrated.274 The authors concluded that use of biomarkers may be helpful in determining the inflammatory status of clinical patients suffering from sepsis and that the success of treatments aimed at suppressing or stimulating immune responses may depend on the individual patient\u2019s inflammatory profile.",

Endothelial dysfunction and damage result in a decreased responsiveness to vasoactive agents (vasoplegia), increased vascular permeability, and a tendency for clot formation in the microvasculature. If the basement membrane and underlying matrix are compromised, microvascular hemorrhage can occur. Endothelial cell damage is primarily neutrophil mediated. More specifically, damage is caused by oxygen-derived free radicals, which are produced within endothelial cells through reactions involving neutrophil-derived elastase and hydrogen peroxide molecules, endothelial cell enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, and endothelial cytosolic iron. The hypochloric anion radical (HO\u02d9) is thought to be responsible most directly for endothelial cell cytotoxicity. Nitric oxide, which is produced by constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells and scavenges superoxide radicals in a reaction to form peroxynitrite, may afford protection from oxygen radical\u2013induced endothelial cell damage. Variations in the ability to produce nitric oxide may explain why vascular beds in different organs vary in their susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated damage.283 Excessive production of nitric oxide by an inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), however, contributes to tissue damage, and increased peroxynitrite concentrations may be responsible in part for PAF-induced increases in vascular permeability.284 In addition to oxygen-derived free radicals, activated neutrophils release matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to tissue damage.272 Vascular endothelial cells are further susceptible to direct effects of various cytokines, most prominently TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1. These cytokines are thought to cause damage via the induction of COX activity and production of prostanoids and through generation of free radicals.

            "text": "Neutrophil activation by LPS and cytokines results in stimulation of phagocytosis and the respiratory burst, release of lysosomal enzymes and inflammatory mediators, and expression of adhesion molecules. Perhaps the single most specific clinicopathologic indicator of endotoxemia is pronounced neutropenia,286 which temporally correlates with peak plasma concentrations of TNF.287 Neutropenia is caused primarily by margination of neutrophils in the vasculature, especially of the lungs,288 whereas significant loss through active migration into peripheral tissues likely is limited to the presence of a localized source of infection. In fact, neutrophils exposed to endotoxin or inflammatory mediators exhibit reduced capacity to respond to chemotactic stimuli and extravasate.288 Margination is made possible by adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and leukocytes that interact and allow sticking of leukocytes to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. The details of neutrophil margination and transmigration are reviewed in several excellent texts.289, 290 Recent evidence demonstrates a role for TLR-4 in neutrophil margination in the lung microvasculature during endotoxemia, and suggests that activation and TLR-4 expression of endothelial cells may be more important than that of circulating neutrophils.288 Although neutrophil activation during infections provides the body with an effective defense system against microbial invaders, margination and reduced migratory ability of neutrophils during endotoxemia results in the accumulation of activated cells at the endothelial surface. These cells are then positioned to effect endothelial injury, increase vascular permeability, and in some cases cause parenchymal cell death and organ dysfunction.291 In addition, inhibition of transmigration deprives the body of phagocytic cells at sites of infection, resulting in reduced ability to fight bacterial infection. This latter complication of endotoxemia may have significant clinical impact, because defective neutrophil recruitment has been demonstrated at low endotoxin doses that do not yet result in tissue damage.291, 292 In human patients endotoxemia and impaired neutrophil migration have been associated with infectious complications of surgical procedures.291 Decreased phagocytic function and oxidative burst activity have also been suggested in sick and septic hospitalized foals,293, 294 in which a beneficial effect of plasma transfusion on neutrophil function could be demonstrated. The mechanisms of migration inhibition during endotoxemia are incompletely understood but may include occupation of neutrophil chemotactic receptors by cytokines and complement components, resulting in an inability of activated cells to respond to a chemotactic gradient.291 Rebound neutrophilia, which is observed frequently following episodes of endotoxemia, is caused by neutrophil release from the bone marrow reserve pool and by stimulation of myeloid cell proliferation via granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and is mediated primarily by TNF and IL-1.270\n",

In human medicine virtually all septic patients are considered to have some degree of coagulopathy, which may range from subclinical abnormalities of the clotting profile to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).297, 298 DIC results from a widespread activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems and failure of their control mechanisms. Ultimately, this leads to disseminated fibrin deposition in the microvasculature, consumption of platelets and clotting factors, and accumulation of fibrin degradation products (FDPs). Depending on the underlying disease process and the relative impairment of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, DIC can manifest as a diffuse thrombotic syndrome leading to ischemic organ failure, a fibrinolytic syndrome with uncontrolled hemorrhage, or a combination of both.299 A procoagulant state characterized by clinicopathologic abnormalities of the clotting profile precedes DIC.",

Peripheral vascular beds are of major importance for the regulation of local tissue perfusion and affect systemic blood pressure by regulating total peripheral resistance. Normally, vascular smooth muscle tone is regulated by endothelin-1 (vasoconstriction), nitric oxide, and prostacyclin (vasodilation) released from vascular endothelial cells.323 Detrimental effects of nitric oxide are attributable to overproduction of nitric oxide by iNOS in macrophages and other cell types, rather than endothelial-derived nitric oxide. Peripheral vasomotor effects of endotoxin manifest as vasodilation and vasoplegia and are mediated by PGI2, nitric oxide, and mediators such as bradykinin. Widespread vasodilation leads to vascular blood pooling, decentralization of blood flow, decreased venous return, and in effect decreased effective circulating volume and cardiac output.322 Compensatory responses in the form of an initial hyperdynamic phase include tachycardia, increased cardiac output and central venous pressure, pulmonary hypertension, peripheral vasoconstriction, and increased peripheral vascular resistance.322, 324, 325\n",

With colitis or proximal enteritis, for example, one may detect signs of endotoxemia before the development of colic, diarrhea, or gastric reflux, which more specifically indicate the nature of the primary illness.

On administration of sublethal doses of LPS, the clinical response can be divided into the early hyperdynamic and the later hypodynamic or shock phases. Clinical signs during the first phase, which begins within 15 to 45 minutes after LPS administration, include anorexia, yawning, sweating, depression, evidence of abdominal discomfort, muscle fasciculations, and recumbency. Heart and respiratory rates increase, and decreased borborygmi suggest ileus. Hyperemia of the mucous membranes and an accelerated capillary refill time indicate the hyperdynamic state.286 If large amounts of LPS are administered or if exposure is ongoing, depression worsens progressively, anorexia persists, and feces develop a diarrheic character. Signs of colic typically abate after the initial stage. Fever develops as a result of direct action of TNF on the thermoregulatory center and IL-1\u2013induced local production of PGE2 in or near the hypothalamus.328, 329 Because of compromised peripheral perfusion, mucous membrane color changes to brick red or purple, a dark \u201ctoxic\u201d line appears, and capillary refill time is prolonged.286 Inadequate peripheral perfusion and compromised organ function finally characterize the hypodynamic shock phase. Body temperature may become subnormal, and the skin, especially on extremities, is cool to the touch. The arterial pulse weakens, and venous fill is decreased. Vascular endothelial damage and increased capillary permeability result in a muddy mucous membrane color and diffuse scleral reddening. Similar changes are evident in horses suffering from endotoxemia associated with natural disease. In the previously mentioned survey,327 tachycardia, fever, abnormal mucous membrane color, and increased capillary refill time were named by most specialists as indicating endotoxemia.",

Renal failure and laminitis327 appear to be common complications of endotoxemia in horses, and endotoxemia was identified as the only clinical condition significantly associated with the development of acute laminitis in one retrospective case-control study of horses admitted to a referral center.330 Other potential complications include liver failure,299 respiratory failure, colic and ischemia-induced gastrointestinal ulceration,234 cardiac failure, and abortion in pregnant mares.331, 332 Renal failure results from ischemic cortical necrosis and acute tubular necrosis caused by coagulopathy-induced afferent arteriolar obstruction. Clinical signs may include oliguria, anuria, or hematuria caused by renal infarction. Laminitis may lead to lameness, increased digital arterial pulsation, increased warmth of the hoof wall, and sensitivity to hoof tester pressure. The exact nature of the association between endotoxemia and laminitis is not understood, and, interestingly, experimental endotoxin infusion does not reliably induce laminitis. Studies have shown, however, that endotoxin administration decreases digital blood flow and laminar perfusion333 coincident with increased plasma concentrations of 5-HT and thromboxane B2 (TXB2).334 In addition, in vitro vascular reactivity of digital vessels is altered following sublethal endotoxin administration to horses.335 In addition to the response to circulating mediators, LPS exposure also alters the production of vasoactive mediators by digital vascular endothelial cells.336 Alterations in vascular reactivity are, therefore, likely responsible for development of laminitis in endotoxemia; however, other mechanisms may apply depending on the underlying clinical disease.",

The most significant changes can be expected with severe inflammatory disease such as colitis,295, 296 devitalized intestine as with strangulating obstruction,296, 340 and with increased duration of disease. In 30 horses with acute gastrointestinal disease, coagulation profiles were considered normal in only two horses.295 Although coagulation times may be shortened during the procoagulant state, commonly observed abnormalities with developing DIC include an increased concentration of FDPs and soluble fibrin monomer, prolonged prothrombin time indicative of factor VII consumption, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time indicative of factor VIII:C and IX consumption, prolonged thrombin time, decreased AT III activity, thrombocytopenia, and decreased protein C and plasminogen activities. Fibrinogen concentration appears to reflect the acute phase response rather than coagulation abnormalities in horses and is frequently increased.304 Some clinicians make a diagnosis of DIC if three or more coagulation parameters (specifically AT III, FDPs, platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time) are abnormal,340 whereas others require overt clinical signs of hemorrhage and concomitant thrombosis in addition to classic laboratory findings.296 The prognostic value of coagulation parameters has been evaluated.233, 296, 314 Overall, persistence or worsening of abnormalities in the face of treatment appears to be more indicative of poor outcome than alterations in any specific parameter. In one study decreased serum AT III concentration was the parameter most commonly associated with fatal outcome in mature horses with colic.295\n",

Identification of responsible microorganisms and their antimicrobial sensitivity spectrum are crucial steps toward effective therapy; however, one should not necessarily delay treatment to obtain culture results. Specimen containers with antimicrobial removal devices may be useful in cases for which initiation of treatment precedes specimen collection. Once a diagnosis is reached, correction of the primary disease process is critical. Examples are removal of devitalized sections of bowel or infected umbilical remnants, drainage of infected pleural or PF, and gastric lavage followed by administration of intestinal adsorbents in cases of grain overload. Di-tri-octahedral smectite (DTO; Bio-Sponge, Platinum Performance Inc., Buellton, CA) was shown to remove endotoxin in an in vitro assay343 and may be useful in preventing endotoxemia of intestinal origin. Septic processes must be addressed with appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and principles of antimicrobial therapy should be followed. Regarding endotoxemia specifically, antimicrobial therapy has been suggested to increase the amount of circulating endotoxin by inducing endotoxin release on cell death of gram-negative bacteria. An in vitro study comparing endotoxin release and inflammatory mediator activity among antimicrobials commonly used to treat E. coli bacteremia in foals evaluated amikacin, ampicillin, amikacin plus ampicillin, ceftiofur, and imipenem. Although these antimicrobials showed no difference in the ability to kill bacteria, amikacin and the amikacin\u2013ampicillin combination resulted in the lowest, and ceftiofur in the greatest, release of endotoxin. Endotoxin release appeared to be dose dependent in that lesser amounts were released at higher antimicrobial concentrations.344 On the basis of these results and clinical experience, combining antimicrobial therapy with endotoxin-binding agents such as polymyxin B may be beneficial, especially when using \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials.",

The effects of polymyxin B in horses have been evaluated in different experimental models.354, 358, 359 In an in vivo study in foals, treatment with polymyxin B at a dosage of 6000 U/kg body mass before infusion with S. typhimurium LPS resulted in significantly less severe elevations of body temperature, respiratory rate, and serum activities of TNF and IL-6 compared with untreated controls.354 Similarly, polymyxin B treatment of adult horses given endotoxin ameliorated clinical signs and decreased plasma TNF activity.360 In the latter study benefits of treatment were also evident at lower dosages of polymyxin B (1000 and 5000 U/kg body mass) and administration of polymyxin B 1 hour after the start of endotoxin infusion. Conversely, polymyxin B failed to ameliorate clinical signs of endotoxemia or prevent the development of coagulopathy, acidosis, lameness, and shock in experimental carbohydrate overload.361 Adverse effects suggestive of neurotoxicity appeared after repeated administration of 5 mg/kg body mass (36,000 U/kg) and in a milder form after administration of 2.5 mg/kg body mass (18,000 U/kg). Nephrotoxicity was not observed. Currently, use of polymyxin B in equine patients is recommended at dosages of 1000 to 6000 U/kg body mass every 8 to 12 hours administered as a slow bolus.362, 363 Treatment should be initiated as early in the disease process as possible because the beneficial effects of LPS scavenging may be limited to the first 24 to 48 hours after the onset of endotoxemia, before endotoxin tolerance develops. Adverse effects in the form of neuromuscular blockade and apnea, which necessitate slow infusion of the drug in human patients, have not been observed in horses. If treating horses with hypovolemia, dehydration, or azotemia, the clinician should attempt to improve peripheral tissue perfusion, minimize the polymyxin B dose, and closely monitor patients for nephrotoxicity. Close monitoring is also important if medications such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, which share a similar spectrum of potential side effects, are administered concurrently. Azotemic neonates are more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of polymyxin B than adult horses.360\n",

This protein is structurally similar to LBP but is expressed exclusively in myeloid precursors of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes.367 BPI is stored in primary granules of mature neutrophils and during inflammation is expressed on their cell membranes and secreted into the extracellular environment.368 BPI has an even higher affinity for LPS than LBP369 and shows antibacterial activity specific for gram-negative bacteria.219 Binding of BPI to the gram-negative bacterial membrane results in growth arrest and is an important factor in the antibacterial activity of intact neutrophils. Furthermore, BPI binding disrupts normal membrane organization and makes bacteria more susceptible to hydrophobic substances, including antimicrobials.370 Experimentally, recombinant BPI protects against the toxic and lethal effects of isolated LPS and intact gram-negative bacteria, and clinical trials in human patients show promising results regarding its therapeutic use.371 The biology and potential use of BPI in horses has not been evaluated.",

Additional beneficial effects may include scavenging of oxygen-derived free radicals and iron chelation; however, side effects may occur at dosages required to achieve these effects.374 Prostanoids have been identified as important mediators in the inflammatory response in a number of studies, and inhibition of their synthesis is associated with beneficial effects. Generally speaking, two COX isoforms are recognized: constitutively expressed COX-1 and inducible COX-2. Upregulation of COX-2 expression results from various proinflammatory stimuli, including LPS, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1.383 Constitutively expressed COX products are likely important for maintenance of homeostasis, whereas increased production of prostanoids by COX-2 is thought to be responsible for detrimental effects during inflammation and shock.",

In an in vivo endotoxemia model in horses, the combination of pentoxifylline (8 mg/kg body mass) and flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg body mass) had greater benefit than each treatment on its own.404 Because of its rheologic properties (i.e., the ability to increase erythrocyte deformability and microvascular blood flow), pentoxifylline has been suggested for use in endotoxemic patients showing evidence of laminitis; however, no effect on blood flow to the hoof was demonstrated after administration to healthy horses.405 An IV preparation of pentoxifylline is not commercially available.",

In these patients hypertonic solutions or colloids may be more appropriate means of stabilization than large volumes of crystalloid solutions. Hypertonic saline solution (7.5% sodium chloride) is the most commonly used hypertonic solution in horses and has beneficial effects in endotoxemic patients.433 A dosage of 4 mL/kg is recommended, which should be given as a bolus infusion over 10 to 15 minutes, followed by administration of an isotonic solution to restore total body fluid volume. The clinician should use hypertonic saline with caution in patients with sodium or chloride derangements and should monitor serum electrolyte concentrations in the case of repeated administration. Failure of urination despite appropriate fluid resuscitation should result in critical evaluation of renal function. In one recent study small-volume resuscitation with hypertonic saline plus hydroxyethyl starch failed to alleviate hemodynamic responses in experimental endotoxin infusion in horses.434\n",

Hetastarch, or hydroxyethyl starch (Hespan), is commercially available as a 6% solution in 0.9% sodium chloride. Hetastarch molecules have a very high molecular weight, and degradation must occur before renal excretion.435 These properties result in a longer plasma half-life and prolonged oncotic effects compared with other colloids; persistence of the oncotic effect for 24 hours was observed in hypoproteinemic horses.436 A dosage of 5 to 15 mL/kg given by slow IV infusion along with an equal or greater volume of crystalloid fluids has been recommended.435, 437 In human patients prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased factor VIII activity, and decreased serum fibrinogen concentration have been described in association with hetastarch use.438 In the limited number of equine studies, bleeding times were not affected439, 440; however, patients treated with hetastarch should be monitored for coagulopathy.",

One should address abnormalities in the coagulation profile as early as possible but especially if they persist more than 24 hours after initiation of therapy. Because of the complex interactions of coagulation and fibrinolysis during endotoxemia, it might be necessary to combine anticoagulant therapy with the administration of fresh frozen plasma to replace clotting and fibrinolytic factors. Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by activation of AT III and subsequent inhibition of thrombin, release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from endothelial cells, and inhibition of platelet aggregation.444 Because endogenous AT III levels frequently are decreased in patients with coagulopathy, the addition of heparin to fresh frozen plasma may be the most effective route of administration. An initial dosage of 100 IU/kg body mass followed by 40 to 80 IU/kg body mass thrice daily has been recommended.357 Anemia caused by erythrocyte agglutination occurs in some patients during therapy with unfractionated heparin445, 446 but typically resolves within 96 hours if therapy is discontinued.357 Because of the risk of microthrombosis associated with erythrocyte agglutination, use of low-molecular-weight heparin (50 IU/kg body mass subcutaneously [SC] every 24 hours) has been recommended447 but may be cost prohibitive. Aspirin can be given orally (10\u201320 mg/kg body mass every 48 hours), which irreversibly inhibits platelet COX activity, to inhibit platelet aggregation and microthrombosis. Platelet hyperaggregability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of carbohydrate-induced laminitis,448 and heparin and aspirin have been recommended to prevent the development of laminitis. In an in vitro study, however, aspirin did not inhibit endotoxin-induced platelet aggregation.449\n",

This reaction causes phosphorylation of specific protein kinases, which induce the actual mucosal membrane transport events. Increases in intracellular free calcium may arise from cyclic nucleotide\u2013dependent release of stored calcium within the cell or from increased calcium entry across the cell membrane. Calcium may act through calmodulin, which then can activate membrane-phosphorylating protein kinases. The net effect is increased movement of sodium and chloride into the mucosal cell from the interstitium, with secretion of sodium and chloride into the intestinal lumen. Water follows the directional flux of sodium and chloride through highly permeable intercellular spaces. Several bacterial toxins and endogenous mediators can cause active secretion and contribute to a synergistic mucosal secretory response. Passive secretion of protein-rich fluid into the lumen occurs after damage to the mucosal epithelium, capillary endothelium, and submucosal inflammation in the proximal small intestine. The clinically relevant events that result from active and passive fluid secretion are proximal small intestinal distention and nasogastric reflux, dehydration, and circulatory shock.466\n",

Suggested mechanisms for increased abdominal fluid protein concentration include serositis associated with inflamed intestine and small intestinal distention causing passive congestion and increased capillary hydrostatic pressure of visceral peritoneal vessels.467 Small intestinal ileus is another hallmark sign of DPJ, and the pathophysiology is complicated, involving primary and secondary dysfunction of the central, autonomic, and ENSs and their purported roles in governing intestinal motility. Further detail regarding the effect of inflammation on small intestinal motility is provided in Inflammatory Disease of the Small Intestine later in this chapter.",

Based on a small number of horses, this therapy has proved promising in terms of minimizing protein losses and decreasing the duration of illness. Postoperative parenteral nutrition ameliorates clinicopathologic evidence of starvation following small intestinal resection and anastomosis in adult horses.471, 472 Providing for part of the nutritional requirements of the horse (8000\u201312,000 kcal/day) is possible with glucose\u2013amino acid solutions, which are of moderate cost.

Despite the progressive nature of lymphomata, onset of clinical signs can be rapid, and the animal may become acutely ill. As with all adult cases of CIBD, antemortem diagnosis is by a process of exclusion and usually is confirmed postmortem. Frequent abnormalities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia or neutropenia, and hypoalbuminemia with hyperglobulinemia, resulting in either a normal elevated serum protein. Lymphocytosis is rare. Intraabdominal masses such as enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes may be palpated per rectum. Abdominocentesis and rectal biopsy can provide a diagnosis but are not sensitive indicators of disease. Carbohydrate absorption tests usually reveal partial to total malabsorption indicative of the severely reduced surface area resulting from significant villous atrophy and the extensive mucosal or transmural infiltration. Confirmation of a diagnosis requires exploratory laparotomy to obtain multiple intestinal and lymph node biopsies if rectal biopsy and/or abdominocentesis are normal. Prognosis is poor, especially because most horses are presented in an advanced state of disease. Immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy may afford temporary improvement, but long-term outcome is unaffected.",

Case reports from many countries revealed a predominance of Standardbred over Thoroughbred horses by three to one.499, 505 Some of the Standardbreds were related, implicating a genetic predisposition, but this has not been proven. Prevalence of this disease is low. The condition is sporadic and has an insidious onset, and the course can be protracted. Significant diagnostic features include anemia, slight increases or decreases in WBC counts, hypoalbuminemia, normal serum protein or hypoproteinemia, occasional increases in serum AP activity, normal serum GGT activity, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes on rectal palpation. Partial or complete malabsorption is typically documented via carbohydrate absorption testing. One can attribute the low proportion of horses exhibiting diarrhea to the preferential distribution of inflammatory infiltration in the small intestine.506 Rectal biopsy can be a useful aid to diagnosis.489\n",

L. intracellularis preferentially infects proliferating cells; thus, it is the tropism for the crypt epithelium. Infected cells proliferate far more rapidly than uninfected cells, suggesting that L. intracellularis directly induces the proliferative response, but the molecular basis for enhanced proliferation is not known. L. intracellularis penetrates epithelial cells in a membrane-bound vesicle but eventually escapes the vacuole and is found free in the cytoplasm, concentrated at the apical pole of the cell. The gross pathologic lesions of equine PE are quite characteristic.518 Lesions may be segmental and are most commonly found in the ileum and terminal jejunum in horses, but the duodenum may also be affected. Severe mucosal hypertrophy is often observed but may wane during the chronic stages of the disease. The mucosa may become corrugated with focal erosions or ulcers. Submucosal edema is often readily identified on cut sections of affected segments. Moderate to severe crypt hyperplasia with atrophy of intestinal villi is a consistent feature. Hyperplastic crypts are branched and may herniate into the submucosa. Necrosis, edema of the submucosal and lamina propria, hemorrhage, mononuclear inflammation, and muscular hypertrophy have been reported in affected intestinal segments but are not consistent. Special stains such as silver stain are required to detect intracellular organisms. The organisms are curved or comma-shaped rods found clustered in the apical cytoplasm of hyperplastic crypt epithelium. The proliferative response of the intestinal mucosa alters absorption of nutrients and fluid secretion by disrupting the architecture of the villi and by altering the maturation of epithelial cells into absorptive cells, accounting for the secretory diarrhea and often severe weight loss. The combined effects of the inflammatory response and malabsorption may account for the clinically observed protein-losing enteropathy.",

Some affected horses may tolerate increased dietary fat. Consultation with an equine nutritionist may provide additional options for a given horse and, in the author\u2019s experience, can prove beneficial. The objective for an affected horse is to sustain, and preferably increase, dietary intake, value, and efficiency. The owner of an affected horse must be prepared to experiment with feeds slowly and deliberately, must be patient, and must keep records. Exposure to a feed component may contribute to the problem as an allergen eliciting a hypersensitivity reaction. Identifying the potential allergen through immunologic testing or by stepwise removal and outcome assessment over a longer period may be difficult.\n",

Short-duration, and in some cases more prolonged and sustained, improvements in body condition, weight gain, demeanor, energy, and activity levels have occurred following corticosteroid administration. Treatment should be initiated as early as possible in the course of disease. Initial parenteral (intramuscular or IV) loading doses of dexamethasone (sodium phosphate) should be followed with a series of depot injections, or orally administered prednisolone, on a tapered dose protocol over a period of months. Interval low-dose therapy may be necessary if clinical signs return after treatment ends. The lowest dose necessary to control the clinical signs with alternate-day therapy should be used. Clinical benefits far outweigh concerns over potential adverse effects. Chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristine, cytosine, cyclophosphamide, and hydroxyurea have been tried in a few cases of CIBD or lymphosarcoma with no apparent success, probably related to the advanced stage of the disease when treatment was initiated and the dose selected.",

Severe cases may be complicated by serosal inflammation and mural ischemia and infarction as a direct extension of mucosal inflammation or secondary to coagulopathies. The diagnostic approach for horses with acute diarrhea is aimed at determining the underlying etiology but must be accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment of hydration, electrolyte and acid-base balance, organ function, and evaluation of the degree of systemic inflammation and the integrity of the intestinal wall. The therapeutic approach for horses with colitis, regardless of cause, consists primarily of controlling local and systemic inflammation, maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, and promoting mucosal repair.

Humoral immunity, however, is often ineffective in preventing disease and dissemination once invasion occurs and S. enterica is established in its intracellular niche. Following invasion, S. enterica is capable of surviving and multiplying within macrophages, rendering the humoral (noncellular) immune systems ineffective.556, 557 Specific cellular immunity may be the most effective defense mechanism in the host arsenal against dissemination and systemic infection by S. enterica.\n557, 558 Protective immunity in horses and calves may be induced by oral inoculation with small numbers of virulent organisms, but the duration of the immunity is not known.559, 560 Oral and parenteral vaccines using killed or attenuated organisms and bacterial products have been promising but are effective only against homologous organisms and are usually not cross-protective among different serogroups.559, 560, 561\n",

In foals, however, salmonellosis is often associated with septicemia. The ability of S. enterica to cause enterocolitis depends on the ability of the bacteria to invade the gastrointestinal mucosa.552, 556 Invasion of the gastrointestinal mucosa occurs preferentially through specialized enterocytes called M cells that overlie intestinal lymphoid tissues such as Peyer\u2019s patches in nonequine species. M cells are exploited by a variety of enteric pathogens during infection of intestinal tissue.562 Invasion of the epithelium occurs by self-induced uptake via the apical membrane of the M cell, often killing the cell in the process.556\nS. enterica then invades neighboring cells via the basolateral membrane, eventually spreading the destruction of the epithelium beyond the principal area of attack. Virulent S. enterica have a well-developed invasion mechanism that involves the generation of an apparatus called a type III secretory system that enables virulence gene products to be injected directly into enterocytes.563 Virulence proteins injected by S. enterica into enterocytes engage the cellular machinery and induce the cell to engulf the bacteria by macropinocytosis. S. enterica virulence gene products also induce enterocyte chloride and fluid secretion and upregulate enterocyte transcription of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) and chemokines that trigger a mucosal inflammatory response.81, 556, 563\n",

The target organ is the gastrointestinal mucosa, with the most severe lesions found in the large intestine.156, 601 Infection of human colonic cells in vitro does not cause major cytopathologic effects for several days.602 Disruption of the microvilli in the region of the plasma membrane in which sodium chloride channels are located has been observed in human colonic cell cultures.602 Infection in horses is associated with variable degrees of morphologic damage.156, 601 Mild morphologic damage and mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria occur early during the infection, but fibrinous, necrotizing typhlocolitis with severe mucosal ulceration and inflammation of the lamina propria may occur later in the disease.

Signs of endotoxemia and shock may accompany acute signs of colic and severe, dehydrating diarrhea. Diarrhea may not be profuse but is usually dark and foul.

Detection of C. perfringens toxins in feces or intestinal contents in horses with high numbers of fecal CFUs and clinical signs of enterocolitis is more conclusive evidence of an enterotoxigenic infection than that based on culture alone.624 Immunoassays are available to detect C. perfringens enterotoxin,624 but the reliability (specificity) of some immunoassays has come into question.

Sudden ingestion of large numbers of infective larvae by a naive host causes acute strongylosis, whereas ingestion of fewer infective larvae over a long period of time by an older, more resistant host causes chronic strongylosis.

Migration of larvae through the intestinal wall early in the course of infection affects myoelectrical activity and motility in the large intestine and may affect retention of ingesta and absorption of fluid.649, 650 The cause of death in acute strongylosis has not been addressed, but it may be related to massive migration through the vasculature, causing thrombosis with ischemia and infarction of the intestine.",

The cyathostome life cycle requires migration by fourth-stage larvae through the mucosa of the large intestine and may include a period of hypobiosis, during which the larvae remain encysted within the mucosal layer of the large intestine.659 After a period of hypobiosis, the larvae emerge in response to a largely unknown stimulus. Most cases occur when larval emergence takes place, classically in the late winter and spring in the northern temperate zones and in the late fall or winter months in the southeastern United States and subtropical regions.659 Sudden emergence of encysted larvae causes mucosal injury, ulceration, and an inflammatory reaction, which are largely responsible for the clinical disease.659, 665 Migration of the larvae as they penetrate the mucosa affects motility patterns and can cause inflammation that may contribute to diarrhea.659 Chronic, eosinophilic, granulomatous colitis and diarrhea with histopathologic evidence of hypobiotic cyathostome larvae in the large intestine have been reported in two horses during a period in which the emergence of larvae would not be expected to occur (early winter).659\n",

Plasma \u03b1-globulin and \u03b2-globulin concentrations may be elevated, which can result in a normal total plasma protein concentration in spite of hypoalbuminemia.658, 659, 660 The serum IgG(T) concentration, however, has been reported to be normal, which may help distinguish cyathostomiasis from S. vulgaris infection.659, 661, 662 PF analysis does not usually reveal any abnormalities, in contrast to horses with S. vulgaris infection. Fecal analysis may be unrewarding because the infection is often not patent when clinical signs are apparent. Measurement of plasma fructosamine may provide a measure of protein catabolism or protein loss in the absence of hypoalbuminemia.667, 668 Plasma fructosamine concentrations are significantly lower in horses with experimental cyathostomiasis than in normal controls,667, 668 suggesting that this test may be a useful diagnostic tool. However, the test has not yet been validated in naturally occurring cases, and neither the specificity nor the sensitivity is known. Rectal scrapings or rectal mucosal biopsies may reveal evidence of cyathostome larvae.659, 662 Definitive diagnosis usually requires microscopic examination of biopsy specimens of the cecum and ascending colon, collected by laparotomy. Examination of biopsy specimens collected from the small intestine is recommended to rule out other causes of weight loss and diarrhea. Appropriate diagnostic tests, such as culture of feces for pathogenic bacteria, should be included in the workup to further rule out other causes.\n",

Acute, severe enterocolitis can occur in horses of all ages receiving antibiotics and can be life-threatening.

Foals are considered to be more susceptible than adult horses to gastrointestinal disease secondary to NSAID administration, and ponies may be more susceptible than horses. NSAID toxicity varies primarily as a result of properties that influence distribution to sensitive tissues and relative selectivity for COX-1 or COX-2. All nonselective NSAIDs are capable of inducing gastrointestinal and renal damage at toxic concentrations. Aspirin has been suggested to be more toxic than other NSAIDs because it irreversibly inactivates COX by acetylation, whereas other NSAIDs reversibly inhibit COX.688 Phenylbutazone is the drug most commonly reported to cause gastrointestinal toxicity in horses, perhaps because of its widespread usage by veterinarians and horse owners or perhaps because of bona fide differences in toxicity in horses compared with other nonselective NSAIDs. Acute phenylbutazone toxicity in horses resulting from overdose is characterized by mucosal ulceration throughout the gastrointestinal tract, oral ulceration, renal papillary necrosis, vasculopathy, thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminemia.690, 691, 692 COX-2\u2013selective NSAIDs appear to be much less toxic in the equine gastrointestinal tract.392, 695 The focus of this discussion is on the toxic effects of NSAIDs on the large intestine, but this necessarily includes elements of upper gastrointestinal and renal disease.",

Cell swelling and necrosis occur, resulting in mucosal ulceration. Oral, esophageal, gastric, and small and large intestinal ulceration have been observed in natural and experimental canthariasis.713, 715, 717 Severe fibrinous to pseudomembranous inflammation and submucosal edema of the intestine have also been reported. Diarrhea probably results from the severe ulceration and inflammation of the large intestine, causing increased secretion of water, electrolytes, and protein and decreased absorption of fluid. Large volumes of fluid and protein are lost in the gastrointestinal tract, causing hemoconcentration and profound hypoalbuminemia in some affected horses.713, 715, 717\n",

However, prostaglandins such as PGE2 and PGI2 also have cytoprotective effects on gastrointestinal mucosa and are critical for mucosal repair.91, 701 NSAIDs used pharmacologically to inhibit colonic inflammation and secretion may be detrimental to mucosal integrity and healing if not used judiciously. NSAIDs exacerbate colonic inflammation in humans with inflammatory colitis, impede mucosal healing in several models of mucosal injury, and have well-documented detrimental effects on colonic mucosa in horses.91, 690, 698, 701 In addition to toxicity to the colonic mucosa, gastric ulceration is not unusual in horses with enterocolitis and may be related to treatment with NSAIDs.

Normal intake of roughage to provide energy may be inadequate; however, feeding of grains should be avoided to prevent delivery of highly fermentable carbohydrate to the colon. Dietary management usually consists of restricting or eliminating long-stem roughage (hay) from the diet and feeding exclusively a complete pelleted diet (at least 30% dietary fiber). The rationale behind this recommendation is to reduce the mechanical and physiologic load on the colon. Frequent meals (4\u20136 times a day) are recommended. Corn oil (1 cup every 12\u201324 hours) can be added to the pellets to increase the caloric intake without adding roughage or grain. It is important to note that if a horse with colitis refuses to eat pelleted feed, then high-quality grass hay should be fed. In anorectic or severely catabolic patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition (total and partial) has been used successfully to provide calories and nutritional support.\n",

Pretreatment with dexamethasone or prednisolone is indicated before anthelmintic administration if heavy larval loads are suspected to prevent an acute exacerbation of the disease by rapid death of encysted larvae. Larvicidal treatment with moxidectin appears to be less likely than fenbendazole to result in tissue inflammation resulting from larval death.764 NSAID administration may have limited value, but dexamethasone appears to be efficacious in refractory cases when used in conjunction with larvicidal anthelmintics.659, 662 Bismuth subsalicylate is often administered orally as an antisecretory agent in young animals.

Branches of the intercostal, lumbar, and iliac arteries supply the parietal peritoneum, and the phrenic and intercostal nerves provide nervous innervation.

PF produced by the mesothelium tends to move ventrally and cranially, aided largely by diaphragmatic movement. PF, waste products, and foreign material exit the peritoneal cavity to enter the lymphatic system through diffusely distributed subendothelial pores or via the large diaphragmatic stomata, depending on particle size.

PF WBC counts in acute peritonitis are reportedly higher than those in chronic peritonitis,768 but this is not always the case, and the WBC count does not always correlate with disease severity or prognosis. The PF WBC count can be greater than 100,000/\u03bcL following enterocentesis, with no clinical signs or problems.780 Conversely, peritoneal WBC counts of fewer than 100,000/\u03bcL may be found in foals or horses with intraabdominal abscesses.781 The peritoneal WBC count can increase to greater than 150,000/\u03bcL following celiotomy782 and can be higher if an enterotomy is done. Postoperatively, the WBC count normally continues to decline and returns to near normal by 5 to 7 days. Failure of the WBC count to decrease suggests peritonitis resulting from a postoperative complication. Finally, PF WBC counts greater than 500,000/\u03bcL indicate severe focal or generalized peritoneal sepsis. With acute peritonitis, PMN cells typically increase to a greater degree than mononuclear cells, but this depends on the cause. In horses with gastrointestinal disease and endotoxemia, the number of peritoneal mononuclear cells increases, as does transformation of mesothelial cells to macrophages. In chronic cases, one easily may mistake transforming mesothelial cells for neoplastic cells, which can make diagnosis difficult.",

If one observes numerous microorganisms of mixed types free in the PF, especially in conjunction with plant material, bowel rupture likely has occurred. The presence of toxic or degenerate neutrophils and bacteria within PMN cells helps to distinguish PF from intestinal contents in such horses. Fluid obtained from enterocentesis is largely devoid of WBCs but is discolored and contains mixed microorganisms and plant material. Bacterial contamination of a sample can occur during collection of the sample, and iatrogenic contamination of a sample can result in free and intracellular bacteria, particularly if processing is delayed. In such cases the bacterial numbers are few and the neutrophils appear healthy. In some cases of gastrointestinal perforation the luminal material, inflammatory cells, and protein may be sequestered by the omentum and further contained by fibrinous adhesions. Abdominal fluid obtained via standard ventral paracentesis may have low cellularity and protein content but large numbers of mixed bacteria, indicating bowel rupture.768 Examples include gastric rupture along the greater curvature of the stomach between the omental layers (omental bursa) and perforated gastric or duodenal ulcers in foals.

IV administration is preferred over oral or intramuscular routes in acute, diffuse, septic peritonitis because more reliable concentrations of drugs are achieved in the tissues and PF.786 The combination of a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside, such as potassium penicillin (22,000\u201344,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours) combined with gentamicin (6.6 mg/kg every 24 hours), is appropriate in most circumstances. Metronidazole (25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) can be added to the regimen given the strong possibility of infection involving penicillin-resistant B. fragilis. This regimen can be modified when culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results become available. Peritonitis caused by A. equuli generally responds well to therapy with penicillin either alone or in combination with gentamicin. Aminoglycosides and NSAIDs have the potential to induce acute renal tubular damage, particularly with concurrent dehydration and decreased renal perfusion. Therefore adequate restoration and maintenance of hydration and monitoring of renal function are important. Monitoring of the WBC count, plasma fibrinogen, SAA, and abdominal fluid analysis often guide duration of therapy. Horses with abdominal abscessation resulting from monomicrobial infections typically require weeks to months of therapy, whereas polymicrobial infection may require many months of antibiotic treatment. Further details regarding principles of antimicrobial therapy are provided elsewhere in this text (Chapter 2).",

This epithelium has baseline transepithelial resistance measurements of approximately 2 to 3000 \u03a9\u2219cm2, which is an order of magnitude higher than the adjacent cardiac mucosa.812, 813 Thus the stratified squamous mucosa is exceptionally impermeable. This is the only mechanism this mucosa has to defend itself against injury. The stratified squamous epithelium consists of four layers: the outer stratum corneum, stratum transitionale, stratum spinosum, and the basal stratum germinativum. However, not all layers contribute equally to barrier function, which is largely composed of interepithelial tight junctions in the stratum corneum and mucosubstances secreted by the stratum spinosum.\n812, 814 The relative impermeability of stratified squamous mucosa can be demonstrated by the effects of HCl on this type of epithelium in vitro, which has very little effect until it reaches a pH of 2.5 or below.813 Although the majority of the literature on equine ulceration pertains to the effects of HCl and inhibitors of HCl secretion,815, 816, 817, 818 other factors may be critical to the development of gastric ulcer disease.",

Attention has also been directed at enhanced mucosal blood flow as a potential mechanism for prostaglandin-mediated cytoprotection\u2014for example, pretreatment with PGI2 protected against ethanol-induced mucosal damage as a result of increased mucosal blood flow.828 In addition PGE2, which is also cytoprotective despite the fact that it does not increase blood flow,829 prevents vascular stasis associated with irritant-induced vascular damage by inhibiting neutrophil adherence to damaged endothelium.830\n",

As an example of their importance in mucosal cytoprotection, pretreatment of newborn rats with capsaicin (which dose dependently destroys sensory nerves) renders the mature rats more susceptible to gastric injury.831 Alternatively, the use of a low dose of capsaicin, which stimulates rather than destroys sensory nerves, protects gastric mucosa against injurious agents.832, 833 Sensory nerves contain neuropeptides such as calcitonin-gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, which may play a protective role via vascular mechanisms. For instance, CGRP stimulates increased gastric blood flow, which is theorized to reduce injury similarly to prostaglandins. Recent studies suggest that the roles of prostaglandins and CGRP in gastric cytoprotection are intimately intertwined. In particular, PGI2 is believed to sensitize sensory nerves following treatment with a mild irritant, with resultant increases in CGRP release and mucosal flow. Similar studies have shown that antagonists of CGRP inhibit the cytoprotective action of PGE2.834 Another neural mediator, nitric oxide, has also been implicated in adaptive cytoprotection. Interestingly, nitric oxide has a number of actions that are similar to those of prostaglandins, including maintenance of mucosal blood flow.835\n",

One other mechanism that helps both the stomach and the intestine to maintain mucosal barrier function is the speed with which the mucosa repairs. For a defect to develop in the mucosal barrier, injurious factors have to outpace mucosal recovery. Such recovery initially involves epithelial migration across denuded regions of basement membrane (restitution).821 This process is so rapid that epithelial defects may be resurfaced within minutes. For example, in bile salt\u2013injured equine colon, denuded surface mucosa was completely covered by restituting epithelium within 180 minutes.207 In the small intestine, intestinal villi greatly amplify the surface area of the mucosal luminal surface, which in turn takes far longer to resurface with restituting epithelium once it has become denuded.836 Intestinal villi, however, are able to dramatically reduce the denuded surface area by contracting.837\n",

Acid secretion is amplified by ECL-released histamine, which interacts with H2 receptors on parietal cells, and G cells, which release the prosecretory hormone gastrin. A combination of histamine and gastrin can have a synergistic effect on parietal cell gastric secretion, because these mediators have distinct receptors and second messengers. On the other hand, D cells are sensitive to an acidic environment and release somatostatin, which inhibits acid secretion.842 Nonetheless, gastric mucosa may be exposed to acid for prolonged periods of time, particularly in horses that are extensively meal fed and do not have the benefit of roughage, which tends to buffer stomach contents.839, 842\n",

Infection with this organism has the effect of raising gastric pH because of disruption of gastric glands but also induces an inflammatory reaction that causes damage.843 However, there is very little evidence that this organism is involved in gastric ulcers in horses. In the absence of a known role for infectious agents in gastric ulceration in animals, ulceration likely develops from injurious factors similar to those found in the proximal stomach, including gastric acid and bile. Some factors that are important to the induction of squamous epithelial ulceration may not be important in the development of proper gastric mucosal ulceration. For example, feed deprivation and intensive training reproducibly induce squamous epithelial ulceration in horses but have little effect on proper gastric mucosa in horses.844 Gastric acid likely plays a key role, whereas other factors such as NSAIDs serve to reduce gastric defense mechanisms. In particular, inhibition of prostaglandin production would reduce mucous and bicarbonate secretion while reducing gastric mucosal blood flow.845 Some of the NSAIDs also have a topical irritant effect, although this appears to be of minor significance, because the route of administration (oral or parenteral) seems to have little influence on the development of ulceration.846\n",

However, mice in which the COX-1 gene has been knocked out fail to develop spontaneous gastric lesions,847 possibly because of compensatory increases in prostaglandin production by COX-2.848 This concept agrees with recent data indicating that inhibition of both COX isoforms is required to induce gastric ulceration.849 From a clinical perspective, these data indicate that drugs selective for either COX-1 or COX-2 may be less ulcerogenic in the horse because they allow the uninhibited COX isoforms to continue to produce protective prostanoids. Because COX-2 elaborates prostaglandins induced by inflammatory stimuli, preferential or selective inhibitors of COX-2 may be particularly useful because of their ability to serve as antiinflammatory agents that are less ulcerogenic.392\n",

This results in continued perfusion of gastrointestinal tissues during the early stages of shock, while other organs such as skeletal muscle undergo massive shunting of blood as a result of marked increases in the resistance of resistance vessels. The reasons for these differences in regulation are not entirely clear but may relate to the relatively high level of energy required to fuel the intestinal mucosa and the serious systemic effects of breaches in the mucosal barrier. When blood flow falls below a critical level, regulatory systems are no longer effective and oxygen uptake by the gastrointestinal tissue decreases, culminating in tissue damage.852\n",

This series of events takes place along the length of the villus, resulting in a villous tip that is relatively hypoxic even under normal conditions. Furthermore, when blood flow is reduced, as occurs in hypovolemic or septic shock, the countercurrent exchange of oxygen is enhanced, and the tip becomes absolutely hypoxic.852 This mechanism might explain why the small intestinal mucosa is more susceptible to ischemic injury, compared with the colon, which has no villi. The duration of ischemia required to produce severe morphologic damage to the equine colon is approximately 25% longer than the small intestine.855\n",

The mechanism of fluid accumulation in this space is not entirely understood but may result from continued epithelial absorption of NaCl and water before it has fully detached from neighboring epithelial cells. This fluid accumulation likely exacerbates epithelial separation from the basement membrane. Subsequently, epithelium progressively sloughs from the tip of the villus toward the crypts, which are the last components of the intestinal mucosa to become injured.163, 406, 861 This likely relates to the vascular architecture, because crypts receive a blood supply that is separate from the vasculature involved in the villous countercurrent exchange mechanism. The early morphologic changes observed in the equine large colon during ischemia are somewhat different from those described in the equine small intestine because of the lack of intestinal villi. As might be expected, the more superficially located surface cells are sloughed before those in crypts.855, 862 The orderly progression of tissue injury has been used by one group of investigators to accurately predict survival in horses with large colon volvulus. Biopsies were taken from the pelvic flexure, which has been previously shown to accurately reflect mucosal changes along the length of the colon,863 and histologically examined for the width of the crypts and intercrypt interstitial space. The latter measurements were expressed as an interstitium: crypt width (I:C) ratio. Nonviable colon was defined as that which had >60% loss of crypt and an I:C ratio >3. Using this methodology, survival was correctly predicted in 94% of horses.864\n",

Therefore it is important to consider mechanisms of ischemic injury in horses with naturally occurring strangulating lesions. The majority of experimental work has either assessed complete ischemia (complete occlusion of the arterial blood supply)855 or low-flow ischemia (reduction of arterial blood flow).866, 867 During intestinal strangulation, however, a disparity between the degree of occlusion of the veins and arteries occurs in which veins are occluded before arteries because of differences in the compliance of vascular walls. Strangulating lesions are typically hemorrhagic (hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction), because the arteries continue to supply blood to tissues that have little or no venous drainage. This results in ischemic injury, as previously outlined, but also in tremendous congestion of the tissues. Such hemorrhagic congestion has two opposing effects: it disrupts tissue architecture, including the mucosa and its epithelium, but it continues to provide oxygenated blood to the tissues during much of the ischemic episode. In contrast, when strangulation results in sudden cessation of arterial blood flow (ischemic strangulating obstruction), tissues appear pale, and the mucosa rapidly degenerates because of a complete lack of oxygenated blood.163 From a clinical standpoint, this makes it difficult to assess the degree of mucosal injury in horses with strangulating injuries, because intestine that may look nonviable (dark red) may in fact have less mucosal injury than that of ischemic strangulated intestine.868\n",

In particular, the type of ischemia used in most laboratory animal studies has been \u201clow-flow ischemia\u201d (in which the blood flow is typically reduced to 20% of baseline flow), whereas studies in horses have used a number of different ischemic models, including various types of strangulating obstruction. Although strangulating obstruction is of great clinical relevance, this type of ischemic insult is less likely to develop reperfusion injury.861, 877, 878 Conversely, low-flow ischemia appears to prime tissues for subsequent injury once the tissue is reperfused, and there is considerable evidence to support the presence of reperfusion injury in horses following low-flow ischemia.866, 867, 871, 879 Nonetheless, low-flow ischemia may not be a common clinical entity.",

            "text": "Reparative mechanisms are similar in the intestine, except that in the small intestine, mucosal villi contribute to mucosal repair. Once intestinal epithelium is disrupted, there are two events that occur almost immediately to reduce the size of the denuded portion of the villus: contraction of the villus and epithelial restitution (Fig. 12.9\n). For example, in porcine ileum subjected to 2 hours of ischemia, villi were 60% of their former height, and 50% of the denuded villous surface area was covered in flattened epithelium within 6 hours.836 Villous contraction appears to be regulated by enteric nerves, because inhibition of enteric nerve conduction prevents villous shortening following injury. The contractile component of the villus is a network of myofibroblasts distributed throughout the lamina propria of the villus and along the central lacteal. Inhibition of villous contraction results in retarded epithelial repair because of the larger denuded surface that remains to be covered by migrating epithelium compared with similarly injured villi that have contracted.837 PGE2 has also been implicated in regulating villous contraction, because application of PGE2 resulted in villous contraction when perfused through normal rat ileum.889 As villi contract, assuming there is an intact basement membrane, epithelium from the margins of the wound migrates in a centripetal direction to resurface toward the tip of the villus.837 The process of restitution is similar in denuded colonic mucosa, except that it may proceed more rapidly because of the lack of villi.207 Epithelial restitution is solely a migratory event that does not depend on provision of new enterocytes by proliferation. Cellular migration is initiated by extension of cellular lamellipodia that receive signals from the basement membrane via integrins. Intracellular signaling converges on the actin cytoskeleton, which is responsible for movement of lamellipodia. Specific components of the basement membrane appear to be critical to the migratory process. For example, application of antibodies to collagen types III and IV, which are important components of intestinal mucosal basement membrane, impeded epithelial restitution.890, 891 Other elements of the basement membrane, including proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, and noncollagenous proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin, may also provide important signals.892 The subepithelial matrix components that facilitate restitution may form the basis for clinical treatments designed to speed up the repair process, analogous to the administration of matrix components to horses with articular cartilage damage.",

Restoration of normal villous architecture required a further 4 days.836 The flattened villous epithelium that characterizes restitution is replaced by newly proliferated crypt epithelium. Under normal circumstances, new enterocytes are formed by the division of stem cells, of which there are approximately four at the base of each mucosal crypt. Newly divided enterocytes migrate from the crypt onto the villus.894 During migration, enterocytes differentiate and acquire specific absorptive and digestive functions. Fully differentiated enterocytes reside on the upper third of the villus for 2 to 3 days and are then sloughed into the intestinal lumen.895 This process is accelerated during mucosal repair, which requires increased proliferative rates. Increased proliferation may be stimulated within 12 to 18 hours by a variety of locally available gut-derived factors, including luminal nutrients, polyamines, and growth factors.836 The return of the normal leaf-like shape of the villus occurs subsequent to the appearance of normal columnar epithelium.",

One study implicated prostaglandins in growth factor\u2013stimulated restitution,896 but a more prominent role of prostaglandins in mucosal repair is their ability to close interepithelial tight junctions.893, 897, 898 For instance, ischemic-injured small intestine rapidly recovered barrier function (as measured in vitro as transepithelial resistance) in the presence of prostaglandins I2 and E2, despite the fact that these prostanoids had relatively little effect on villous contraction and epithelial restitution. However, electron microscopic examination of tissues reveals dilation of tight junctions in tissues treated with NSAIDs,898 whereas those additionally treated with prostaglandins have closely apposed tight junctions (Fig. 12.10\n). Prostaglandins stimulate closure of tight junctions via the second messengers cAMP and Ca2+,893 which interestingly were among the first mediators found to modulate tight junction permeability.899, 900 Such tight junction closure is of considerable importance to patients with intestinal injury that are treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, because reduced prostaglandin levels may result in increased intestinal permeability. For example, in a study on ischemic-injured porcine ileum, treatment with the NSAID indomethacin resulted in a significant increase in intestinal permeability to inulin and lipopolysaccharide compared with tissues that were additionally treated with PGI2 and PGE2.893\n",

Polyamines regulate cytoskeletal cellular migration via activation of the small GTPase Rho-A by elevating intracellular Ca2+ levels. These elevations in Ca2+ result from polyamine regulation of expression of voltage-gated K+ channels and altered membrane electrical potential.906\n",

The most important of these growth factors in early mucosal repair events is TGF-\u03b2, which is a potent stimulus of epithelial restitution and modulator of the ECM.821 Neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 retards epithelial migration in vitro, and it appears that TGF-\u03b2 may serve as a point of convergence for mediators of restitution, because neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 also inhibits the effects of other peptides. However, TGF-\u03b2 paradoxically inhibits epithelial proliferation, reducing the supply of new enterocytes for mucosal repair. Conversely, EGF, produced by the salivary glands and duodenal Brunner\u2019s glands, and the related TGF-\u03b1, produced by small intestinal enterocytes, are potent stimulants of enterocyte proliferation. These growth factors share approximately 30% of their amino acid structure, bind to the same receptor on the basolateral surface of enterocytes, and are not related to TGF-\u03b2.911 The physiologic role of EGF is somewhat difficult to discern because it is present in the intestinal lumen, with no apparent access to its basally located receptor.912 It has been proposed that EGF acts as a \u201csurveillance agent\u201d that gains access to its receptor during epithelial injury (when the EGF receptor would likely be exposed) to stimulate proliferation.912 TGF-\u03b1 presumably has a similar role, but it is present in greater concentrations in the small intestine because it is produced by differentiated villous enterocytes. The mature peptide is cleaved from the extracellular component of the transmembrane TGF-\u03b1 precursor and released into the lumen.911\n",

Under physiologic conditions, trefoil peptides are secreted by mucus-producing cells at distinct anatomic sites. For example, the trefoil peptide pS2 is produced by gastric epithelium, whereas ITF is produced by small and large intestinal mucosa.701 However, any of the trefoil peptides may be upregulated within repairing epithelium regardless of the anatomic site.821, 913 In addition, trefoil peptides have the ability to induce their own expression, amplifying the level of these reparative factors at sites of mucosal repair.914 Trefoil peptides are the most potent stimulants of epithelial migration in vitro, and their effects are independent of growth factors, including TGF-\u03b2.915 Recent evidence suggests that EGF receptor activation is required for the induction of pS2 and another of the trefoil peptides called spasmolytic peptide in gastric epithelium in vitro. The importance of trefoil peptides to the mucosal repair response in vivo is illustrated by gene knockout studies, in which mice deficient in ITF have a dramatically reduced ability to repair intestinal injury.916 Detergent-induced mucosal injury was lethal because of a lack of restitution compared with wild-type mice that fully recovered from similar mucosal injury. The fact that restitution was restored by administration of ITF has important therapeutic implications. The mechanism by which trefoil peptides stimulate epithelial migration has yet to be fully characterized, but it appears to involve translocation of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin, allowing cells to become untethered from neighboring cells.821\n",

For example, in the piglet IPEC-J2 enterocyte cell line, glutamine enhanced gene transcription by increasing MAPK activity.917, 918 Similarly, butyrate stimulated mucosal growth following colonic infusion in the rat.919 Because of such growth-promoting actions, glutamine was shown to prevent the intestinal mucosal atrophy and dysfunction that accompany starvation920, 921 and long-term total parenteral nutrition.922, 923 Glutamine improves the function of transplanted small intestine924, 925 and protects intestinal mucosa from injury if administered before chemotherapy926 and radiation.927, 928 Intestinal nutrients may also synergize with other proliferative agents. For example, administration of glutamine and TGF-\u03b1 to porcine ileum that had been subjected to 2 hours of ischemia resulted in a synergistic increase in MAPK activity, enterocyte proliferation, and villous surface area.836 Although there has been a concern that such early return to normal surface area may result in dysfunctional mucosal digestive and absorptive function because of resurfacing denuded mucosa with immature epithelium, nutrients and growth factors also appear to promote early differentiation. In the case of glutamine and TGF-\u03b1 restoration of postischemic small intestine, rapid recovery of digestive enzymes was also documented.929\n",

Other cases occur spontaneously, often in animals with painful primary conditions such as uveitis or septic tenosynovitis. In a study of 114 horses diagnosed with cecal impaction, 12 were hospitalized for a condition other than colic at the time of diagnosis, and 9 others were being treated with phenylbutazone, most for a musculoskeletal injury.939 Eight of the 114 horses had undergone general anesthesia in the 8 days preceding diagnosis. The syndrome is frustrating in that clinical signs are often subtle unless cecal perforation has occurred. In horses with a cecal emptying defect after anesthesia, overt signs are usually apparent 3 to 5 days after the procedure. The earliest detectable signs include depression and a reduction in feed intake and fecal output. Ineffective emptying results in overfilling of the cecum with moist contents, which is manifested by signs of mild to moderate colic.

A combination of central and autonomic innervation influences events, but contraction does not require external neural input. The parasympathetic supply to the gastrointestinal tract is via the vagus and pelvic nerves, and the sympathetic supply is through postganglionic fibers of the cranial and caudal mesenteric plexuses. A complex network of interneurons within each plexus integrates and amplifies neural input; the intensity and frequency of resultant smooth muscle contractions are proportional to the amount of sympathetic and parasympathetic input. Additional binding sites for a number of other endogenous chemicals, including dopamine, motilin, and serotonin, exist within the ENS and on smooth muscle cells.945 Acetylcholine is the dominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract and exerts its action through muscarinic type 2 receptors on smooth muscle cells. Sympathetic fibers innervating the gastrointestinal tract are adrenergic, postganglionic fibers with cell bodies located in the prevertebral ganglia. Activation of \u03b12-adrenergic receptors on cholinergic neurons within enteric ganglia inhibits the release of acetylcholine, reducing intestinal contraction. \u03b21-, \u03b22-, and \u03b2-atypical receptors are directly inhibitory to the intestinal smooth muscle.946 Inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitters include adenosine triphosphate, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and nitric oxide.947, 948 These neurotransmitters are critical for mediating descending inhibition during peristalsis and receptive relaxation. Substance P is a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter that may be involved in contraction of the large colon.949, 950\n",

Similar inflammatory effects were evident with mechanical manipulation of the equine jejunum.956 The inflammatory response to bowel manipulation is not limited to the affected tissue, but it can also result in global inflammation and ileus throughout the gastrointestinal tract.957\n",

The disorder, therefore, is probably not appropriately considered as a form of POI in horses. General anesthesia itself is a potent inhibitor of gastrointestinal motility in horses, but these effects are short-lived and reversible within hours of anesthetic withdrawal.952 The return of normal motility in horses after experimental ileus was most delayed in the cecum, suggesting that this may be a common site of ileus in horses.992 A link between routine postoperative medications, such as phenylbutazone and aminoglycoside antibiotics, has been suspected but not established. An inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on large colon contractility has been demonstrated using in vitro techniques.993 Primary sympathetic overstimulation could be involved, because many of the affected animals are young, male horses or animals with painful diseases.",

In contrast to newer generation benzamides, metoclopramide is also an antagonist at dopamine 1 (DA1) and dopamine 2 (DA2) receptors. Antagonism of prejunctional DA2 receptors facilitates acetylcholine release and smooth muscle contraction. Metoclopramide crosses the blood-brain barrier, where its antagonist properties on central DA2 receptors can result in extrapyramidal signs, including seizure. Metoclopramide increased contractility of muscle strips in vitro in the pyloric antrum, proximal duodenum, and midjejunum.1008 These in vitro data support previous work in which metoclopramide administration restored gastroduodenal coordination of motility in a model of POI.1009 In another study, metoclopramide had no effect on jejunal or pelvic flexure myoelectrical activity.973 Constant IV infusion (0.04 mg/kg/h) of metoclopramide was well tolerated in a population of postoperative horses and significantly decreased the volume and duration of gastric reflux over control and intermittent drug infusion groups.1010\n",

This dosage did not alter MMC duration or spiking activity, reset the MMC in the jejunum in clinically normal horses1031 or significantly alter a variety of indicators of POI after colic surgery.1032 Significantly more horses with POI stopped refluxing within 30 hours following the institution of lidocaine infusion, relative to saline infusion.475 Lidocaine administration did not affect the prevalence of POI, duration or volume of reflux, or survival in horses requiring surgery for treatment of small intestinal colic.1033 Lidocaine infusion can be associated with reversible side effects that include muscle fasciculations, ataxia, and seizure.

Although strangulation of the intestinal lumen results in clinical signs similar to those of simple obstruction, occlusion of the blood supply results in a more rapid deterioration of the intestinal mucosa and subsequent onset of sepsis. Although there has been a great deal of interest in the relevance and treatment of intestinal reperfusion injury,851, 861, 882 the lesion that develops during strangulation is often severe, leaving little viable bowel for further injury during reperfusion.882 Although extensive lengths of strangulated small intestine may be resected, strangulation of the large colon presents a much greater treatment dilemma because strangulated intestine usually extends beyond the limits of surgical resection.1035 Therefore horses with large intestinal strangulation are often recovered with extensive intestinal injury left in place. As a result, subtle degrees of reperfusion injury may be very important in horses with large colon disease, warranting further work in this area in an attempt to reduce mortality.851\n",

This lesion is noted by a darkened appearance in affected bowel and increased thickness as blood is pumped into the lesion. Ischemic strangulating obstruction occurs if the intestine is twisted tightly enough to simultaneously occlude both arteries and veins. In the case of the colon, some researchers suggest that this may be determined by how much ingesta is in the colon, because intestinal contents may prevent the intestine from twisting tightly.1036 Tissue involved in ischemic strangulating obstruction appears pale and of normal or reduced thickness because of a complete lack of blood flow (Fig. 12.11\n). Bowel peripheral to strangulating lesions may also become injured as a result of distention, which reduces mural blood flow once it reaches critical levels. As this intestine is decompressed, it may also undergo reperfusion injury.879, 1037, 1038\n",

During the latter stages of the disease process, horses may not experience much pain but rather become profoundly depressed as affected intestine undergoes necrosis. Affected horses have progressive signs of sepsis, including congested mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, and an elevated heart rate (>60 beats/min in most cases). Reflux is typically obtained after passage of a stomach tube, and loops of distended small intestine are usually detected on rectal palpation of the abdomen. These latter findings are variable, depending on the duration and location of the obstruction. For example, horses with ileal obstructions tend to reflux later in the course of the disease process than horses with jejunal obstructions. A horse that has an entrapment of small intestine in the epiploic foramen or a rent in the proximal small intestinal mesentery may not have palpable loops of small intestine because of the cranial location of these structures.1039 Abdominocentesis can provide critical information on the integrity of the intestine and is indicated in horses with suspected strangulation of the small intestine. Affected horses typically have serosanguineous abdominal fluid with an elevated protein concentration (>2.5 mg/dL) and an increase in PF:plasma lactate, although these cases must be differentiated from proximal enteritis.11, 22, 783 When an initial sample is inconclusive, repeated measurement of PF lactate may provide additional support for a diagnosis of a strangulating lesion.27 Generally, horses with small intestinal strangulation show continued signs of abdominal pain, whereas horses with proximal enteritis (discussed in Duodenitis-Proximal Jejunitis previously in this chapter) tend to be depressed after initial episodes of mild abdominal pain.1040 In addition, horses with small intestinal strangulation continue to deteriorate clinically despite appropriate medical therapy and begin to show elevated WBC counts (>10,000 cells/\u03bcL) in the abdominal fluid as the duration of strangulation increases. There are horses in which small intestinal strangulation and proximal enteritis cannot be not readily distinguished, at which point surgery may be elected rather than prolonging the decision to perform abdominal exploration on a horse with a potential strangulating lesion.1040\n",

It is bounded dorsally by the caudate process of the liver and caudal vena cava and ventrally by the pancreas, the hepatoduodenal ligament, and the portal vein.1039 Intestine may enter the foramen from the visceral surface of the liver toward the right body wall or the opposite direction. Studies differ as to which is the most common form. In the case of entrapments that enter the foramen in a left-to-right direction, the omental bursa is ruptured as the intestine migrates through the epiploic foramen, which may contribute to the intraabdominal hemorrhage often seen with this condition. Clinical signs include acute onset of severe colic with examination findings compatible with small intestinal obstruction. The stereotypic behavior of crib biting is a significant risk factor for EFE,1051 possibly because of changes in abdominal pressure as the horse prepares the esophagus to ingest air. Other risk factors include increased height of the horse and previous colic surgery.1051 The condition was once believed to be more prevalent in older horses,1039 but this has been refuted.1051 The disorder has also been recognized in foals as young as 4 months of age.1052 The diagnosis is definitively made at surgery, although ultrasonographic findings of distended loops of edematous small intestine adjacent to the right middle body wall are suggestive of EFE.1039 Generally, thickened, immotile intestine on ultrasonographic examination is highly predictive for small intestinal strangulating obstruction.1053, 1054 Small intestine entrapped in the epiploic foramen may be limited to a portion of the intestinal wall (parietal hernia),1055 and the large colon may become entrapped within the epiploic foramen.1051 In treating EFE, the epiploic foramen must not be enlarged either by blunt force or with a sharp instrument, because rupture of the vena cava or portal vein and fatal hemorrhage may occur. Prognosis has substantially improved over the past decade, with current short-term survival rates (discharge from the hospital) ranging from 74% to 95%.1039, 1049, 1050, 1051, 1056 Survival to 1 year (50.6%) and 2 years (34.3%) postoperatively declines substantially, with a median survival time of 397 days in one report.1051 Preoperative abdominocentesis,1039, 1056 packed cell volume, length of small intestine resected, and POI1051 have been associated with postoperative survival.\n",

Small intestinal volvulus is theoretically initiated by a change in local peristalsis or the occurrence of a lesion around which the intestine and its mesentery may twist (e.g., an ascarid impaction).1060 It is reportedly one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of small intestinal obstruction in foals.1061, 1062 It has been theorized that young foals may be at risk for small intestinal volvulus because of changing feed habits and adaptation to a bulkier adult diet. Onset of acute, severe colic; a distended abdomen; and radiographic evidence of multiple loops of distended small intestine in a young foal would be suggestive of small intestine volvulus. However, it is not possible to differentiate volvulus from other causes of small intestinal obstruction preoperatively. In adult horses volvulus frequently occurs in association with another disease process, during which small intestinal obstruction results in distention and subsequent rotation of the small intestinal around the root of the mesentery. Although any segment of the small intestine may be involved, the distal jejunum and ileum are most frequently affected because of their relatively longer mesenteries.1060 The diagnosis is made at surgery by palpating a twist at the origin of the cranial mesenteric artery. Treatment includes resection of devitalized bowel, which may not be an option because of the extent of small intestinal involvement (similar to large colon volvulus). Prognosis is based on the extent of small intestine involved and its appearance after surgical correction of the lesion. Generally, horses in which more than 50% of the small intestine is devitalized are considered to have a grave prognosis.1063\n",

The nature of the hernia (direct versus indirect) is determined on the basis of the integrity of the parietal vaginal tunic. In horses in which the bowel remains within the parietal vaginal tunic, the hernia is referred to as indirect because, strictly speaking, the bowel remains within the peritoneal cavity. Direct hernias are those in which strangulated bowel ruptures through the parietal vaginal tunic and occupies an SC location. These direct hernias most commonly occur in foals and should be suspected when a congenital inguinal hernia is associated with colic, swelling that extends from the inguinal region of the prepuce, and intestine that may be palpated SC.1067, 1068 Although most congenital indirect inguinal hernias resolve with repeated manual reduction or application of a diaper, surgical intervention is recommended for congenital direct hernias.1068\n",

In many horses the short segment of herniated intestine will markedly improve in appearance once it has been reduced and does not always have to be resected.1074 The affected testicle will be congested because of vascular compromise within the spermatic cord, and although it may remain viable, it is generally recommended that it be resected.1074 The prognosis in adult horses is good, with up to 75% of horses surviving to 6 months of age.1069, 1070, 1071 Horses that have been treated for inguinal hernias may be used for breeding. In these horses the remaining testicle will have increased sperm production, although an increased number of sperm abnormalities will be noticed after surgery because of edema and increased temperature of the scrotum.",

            "text": "An intussusception involves a segment of bowel (intussusceptum) that invaginates into an adjacent aboral segment of bowel (intussuscipiens). The reason for such invagination is not always clear, but it may involve a lesion at the leading edge of the intussusception, including small masses, foreign bodies, or parasites. In particular, tapeworms (Anoplocephala perfoliata) have been implicated.1077 Ileocecal intussusceptions are the most common intestinal intussusceptions in the horse and typically affect young animals. In one study evaluating 26 cases of ileocecal intussusception, the median age of affected horses was 1 year.1078 Acute ileocecal intussusceptions are those in which the horses have a duration of colic of less than 24 hours and involve variable lengths of intestine, which ranged in one study from 6 cm to 457 cm in length. In acute cases the involved segment of ileum typically has a compromised blood supply. Chronic ileocecal intussusceptions typically involve short segments of ileum (up to 10 cm in length), and the ileal blood supply is frequently intact.1078 Abdominocentesis results are variable because strangulated bowel is contained within the adjacent bowel. There is often evidence of obstruction of the small intestine, including nasogastric reflux and multiple distended loops of small intestine on rectal palpation. Horses with chronic ileocecal intussusceptions have mild, intermittent colic, often without evidence of small intestinal obstruction. In one study a mass was palpated in the region of the cecal base in approximately 50% of affected horses.1078 Transabdominal ultrasound may be helpful in discerning the nature of the mass. The intussusception has a characteristic target appearance on cross section1079, 1089, 1081 and has been reported as a frequent incidental finding in Standardbred foals.1082 Other segments of the small intestine may also be intussuscepted, including the jejunum (Fig. 12.12\n). In one study of 11 jejunojejunal intussusceptions, the length of bowel involved ranged between 0.4 and 9.1 m.1083 Attempts at reducing intussusceptions at surgery are usually futile because of intramural swelling of affected bowel. Jejunojejunal intussusceptions should be resected.",

Auscultation may also reveal thoracic intestinal sounds, but it is typically not possible to differentiate these from sounds referred from the abdomen. In one report, two of three horses diagnosed with small intestinal strangulation by diaphragmatic hernia had respiratory acidemia, attributable to decreased ventilation.1089 Treatment of horses with diaphragmatic hernia is fraught with complications because of the need to reduce and resect strangulated bowel and the need to repair the defect in the diaphragm; prognosis has not appeared to improve over time.1089, 1090, 1091, 1092 Because dorsal defects in the diaphragm are among the most common forms of diaphragmatic defect, it may not be possible to close the diaphragmatic hernia by way of the approach used for abdominal exploratory. Because herniation is likely to recur, it is appropriate to schedule a second surgery using an appropriate approach to resolve the diaphragmatic defect.",

            "text": "Horses with large colon volvulus have rapid onset of severe, unrelenting abdominal pain. Postpartum broodmares appear to be at risk for this form of colic.1035 Once the large colon is strangulated (>270-degree volvulus), gas distention is marked, leading to gross distention of the abdomen, compromised respiration as the distended bowel presses up against the diaphragm, and visceral pooling of blood as the caudal vena cava is compressed. Horses with this condition are frequently refractory to even the most potent of analgesics. These horses may prefer to lie in dorsal recumbency, presumably to take weight off the strangulated colon. An abbreviated physical examination is warranted in these cases because the time from the onset of strangulation to surgical correction is critical. Under experimental conditions the colon is irreversibly damaged within 3 to 4 hours of a 360-degree volvulus of the entire colon.855 Despite severe pain and hypovolemia, horses may have a paradoxically low heart rate, possibly related to increased vagal tone. Results of abdominocentesis often do not indicate the degree of colonic compromise,1035, 1093 and in many cases it is not worth attempting to obtain abdominal fluid because of extreme colonic distention.1093 Rectal palpation reveals severe gas distention of the large colon, frequently associated with colonic bands traversing the abdomen. Severe colonic distention may restrict access to the abdomen beyond the pelvic brim. One study has shown that plasma lactate levels below 6.0 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 83% in predicting survival in horses with large colon volvulus.1094\n",

After correction of the volvulus, a determination must be made as to whether the colon has been irreversibly injured. This should be based on mucosal color and bleeding (if an enterotomy has been performed), palpation of a pulse in the colonic arteries, serosal color, and appearance of colonic motility.1036 If the colon is judged to be irreversibly damaged, the feasibility of a large colon resection can be considered. Although 95% of the colon can be resected (that part of the colon distal to the level of the cecocolic fold), damage from the volvulus may exceed that which can be resected. In these cases surgeons may elect to resect as much damaged bowel as possible or advise euthanasia.1036\n",

These conditions tend to occur in young horses (63% were younger than 3 years old in one study) and may be associated with intestinal tapeworms.1099 Clinical signs are variable, including acute, severe colic, intermittent pain over a number of days, and chronic weight loss.1099 These variable presentations likely relate to the degree to which the cecum has intussuscepted. Initially, the cecal tip inverts, creating a cecocecal intussusception, which does not obstruct the flow of ingesta. As the intussusception progresses, the cecum inverts into the right ventral colon (cecocolic intussusception), which obstructs the flow of ingesta and often causes severe colic (Fig. 12.13\n). The cause of abdominal pain is often difficult to differentiate in these cases, although it is sometimes possible to detect a mass on the right side of the abdomen by either rectal palpation or ultrasound examination.1099 Treatment involves manual surgical reduction by retracting the intussusceptum directly or by way of an enterotomy in the right ventral colon.1099, 1100 Sometimes the cecum cannot be readily reduced because of severe thickening, and in other cases surgical procedures result in fatal contamination. In one report 8 of 11 horses were euthanized in the perioperative period because of complications,1101 and in another report 12 of 30 horses were euthanized either before or during surgery. The latter included all of the horses with chronic disease because of irreversible changes to the cecum.1099 One report on cecocolic intussusceptions indicated that 7 of 8 horses that underwent right ventral colon enterotomy and cecal resection survived long term,1100 suggesting that continued improvements in surgical techniques may improve the prognosis.",

Surgical exploration of the abdomen should be performed to determine the status of the small colon, although serial abdominocenteses can be used in lieu of surgery to detect progressive necrosis of the bowel.

Euthanasia is often warranted on the basis of physical examination findings. Confirmation of severe small colon injury requires abdominal exploration using either a midline approach or laparoscopy.1110 It is conceivable that a horse with a compromised small colon could undergo a colostomy of the proximal small colon, but the compromised small colon will typically necrose beyond that which can be resected using a midline abdominal approach.1108\n",

Any segment of intestine supplied by the cranial mesenteric artery or one of its major branches may be affected, but the distal small intestine and large colon are more commonly involved.1111 There are no clinical variables that can be used to reliably differentiate this disease from strangulating obstruction.1099 In some cases massive infarction results in acute, severe colic.1111 Occasionally, an abnormal mass and fremitus may be detected on rectal palpation of the root of the cranial mesenteric artery.

Clinical signs include acute onset of colic after administration of an anthelmintic and signs compatible with small intestinal obstruction, including nasogastric reflux. Occasionally, dead parasites are present in the reflux. The onset of the disease varies according to the degree of obstruction.1116 A tentative diagnosis may be made on the basis of the history and signs referable to small intestinal obstruction. Abdominal ultrasound may indicate the presence of multiple loops of distended small intestine and can be used to estimate ascarid burden within the small intestine.1117 Initial medical treatment should include pain management and supportive care. Surgical treatment may involve an enterotomy removal of ascarids, although manual reduction without enterotomy was associated with improved survival in one report.1118 The prognosis is fair in cases that are rapidly addressed but poor in foals with evidence of hypovolemia and septic shock.

Although feeding of coastal Bermuda hay has been implicated in this regional distribution,1115 it has been difficult to separate geographic location from regional hay sources as risk factors.1119 Nonetheless, it is likely that feeding suboptimal quality coastal Bermuda hay puts horses at risk for ileal impaction, possibly because this type of hay may have a high fiber content and thin strands that can lead to premature swallowing. The relationship between fiber content and eating patterns is theoretical and remains to be proved. Sudden changes in feed from an alternative type of hay to coastal Bermuda hay likely put a horse at risk for ileal impaction.1119 Studies in the United Kingdom have revealed tapeworm infection as an important risk factor for ileal impaction. Based on risk analysis, the data suggested that more than 80% of the ileal impaction cases studied were associated with serologic or fecal evidence of tapeworm infection.1120 Because of the poor sensitivity of fecal analysis for tapeworms, a serologic test (ELISA) has been developed by Proudman et al. with a sensitivity of approximately 70% and a specificity of 95%.1121, 1122\n",

A proposed mechanism for idiopathic ileal hypertrophy is parasympathetic neural dysfunction resulting in chronically increased muscle tone and subsequent hypertrophy of the muscular layers of the ileal wall. Such neural dysfunction possibly results from parasite migration.1124 Alternative hypotheses include chronic increases in the muscular tone of the ileocecal valve, leading to muscular hypertrophy of the ileum as it contracts against a partially occluded ileocecal valve. The jejunum may also be hypertrophied, either alone or in combination with the ileum.1124 Clinical signs include chronic intermittent colic as the ileum hypertrophies and gradually occludes the lumen. Partial anorexia and chronic weight loss (1\u20136 months) were documented in 45% of affected horses, most likely because of intermittent colic and reduced appetite.1124 Because the ileal mucosa is not affected by this condition, there is no reason to believe that these horses experience malabsorption of nutrients. The diagnosis is usually made at surgery, although the hypertrophied ileum may be palpated rectally in some cases.1124 An ileocecal or jejunocecal anastomosis to bypass the hypertrophied ileum is usually performed in affected horses. Without surgical bypass intermittent colic persists, and the thickened ileum may ultimately rupture.1124 The prognosis is fair with surgical treatment.1125\n",

For example, a fibrous adhesion that does not by itself obstruct the intestinal lumen might serve as the pivot point for a volvulus, whereas an adhesion between adjacent segments of the intestinal tract may create a hairpin turn that causes chronic partial obstruction.1130 The number of adhesions that develop may also vary dramatically from horse to horse. Some horses may develop a single adhesion adjacent to an anastomotic site or a discrete segment of injured intestine, whereas other horses may develop diffuse adhesions involving multiple segments of intestine, likely because of widespread inflammatory disease at the time of the original surgery.",

In one study assessing the margins of resected small intestine, extensive neutrophil infiltration was documented in the serosa, particularly in the proximal resection margin that had been distended before correction of a variety of strangulating lesions.868 Regions of serosal injury and inflammation subsequently undergo reparative events similar to those of any wound, including local production of fibrin, de novo synthesis of collagen by infiltrating fibroblasts, and ultimately maturation and remodeling of fibrous tissue. Unfortunately, during this process fibrin may result in injured intestinal surfaces adhering to adjacent injured bowel or an adjacent organ. Once a fibrinous adhesion has developed, new collagen synthesis may result in a permanent fibrous adhesion. Alternatively, fibrinous exudate may be lysed by proteases released by local phagocytes, reversing the adhesive process. Formation of adhesions may be viewed as an imbalance of fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis.1131\n",

Adhesions are an important differential for intermittent colic in the postoperative period, particularly if such colic was not relieved by nasogastric decompression of the stomach. Continued intermittent colic should prompt abdominocentesis to determine whether there is evidence of septic peritonitis, which may contribute to adhesion formation. If postoperative colic persists, repeat laparotomy or laparoscopy may be elected. In one study on adhesions, 70% of repeat laparotomies were performed within 60 days, suggesting that surgical colic attributable to adhesions typically occurs within 2 months of an initial surgical procedure. Unfortunately, the prognosis for horses with colic attributable to adhesions is poor, with only 16% of horses surviving adhesion-induced colic in one study.1130\n",

In horses with primary cecal impactions, there is a gradual onset of abdominal pain over a number of days reminiscent of the development of a large colon impaction. Cecal impactions should be differentiated from large colon impactions on the basis of rectal palpation findings. These impactions have a propensity to rupture before the development of severe abdominal pain or systemic deterioration and therefore must be closely monitored.1139 Secondary cecal impactions typically develop after unrelated surgical procedures that result in postoperative pain (particularly orthopedic surgeries).1140 Secondary cecal impactions may be even more difficult to detect because postoperative depression and decreased fecal output may be attributed to the operative procedure rather than colic. By the time horses with secondary cecal impactions show noticeable signs of colic, the cecum may be close to rupture. In many cases there will be no signs of impending rupture.1140 Therefore the feed intake and manure production of all horses that undergo surgery in which considerable postoperative pain may develop should be closely monitored. A recent study indicated that horses producing less than three piles of manure daily in the postoperative period are at risk of developing a large intestinal impaction. Horses that underwent prolonged (>1 hour) orthopedic surgery that received inadequate treatment with phenylbutazone were at considerable risk of reduced postoperative fecal output.1141\n",

The formation of Mg-based minerals is puzzling because of the relative abundance of Ca in colonic fluids, which would favor the formation of Ca phosphates (apatite) rather than struvite. Elevated dietary intake of magnesium and protein may play a role. Feeding of alfalfa hay and decreased dietary proportions of grass hay and pasture grass have been consistently identified as risk factors in horses with enterolithiasis.1149, 1150, 1151 Alfalfa hay has a concentration of magnesium approximately six times the daily requirements of the horse.1152 The high protein concentration in alfalfa hay may contribute to calculus formation by increasing the ammonia nitrogen load in the large intestine. Enteroliths most commonly form around a nucleus of silicon dioxide (a flintlike stone), but nidi have included nails, rope, and hair that have been ingested.1153 Enteroliths are usually found in the right dorsal and transverse colons.1152 Although enterolithiasis has a wide geographic distribution, horses in California have the highest incidence. In one California study, horses with enterolithiasis represented 28% of the surgical colic population, and Arabians, Morgans, American Saddlebreds, and donkeys were at greatest risk of this disease.37 In a study of enterolithiasis in Texas, risk factors also included feeding of alfalfa hay and the Arabian breed. In that study, Miniature Horses were also found to be at risk.1149 Horses with enteroliths are rarely younger than 4 years old, with a median age of 11 in one report37; an enterolith has been reported in an 11-month-old Miniature Horse.1154\n",

Fine sand tends to accumulate in the ventral colon, whereas coarse sand may accumulate in the dorsal colon.737, 1156 Individual differences in colonic function may contribute to accumulation of sand because some horses can clear consumed sand, whereas others cannot. Distention resulting from the impaction itself, or gas proximal to the impaction, causes abdominal pain. Sand may also trigger diarrhea, presumably as a result of irritation of the colonic mucosa.738 In horses with sand impactions, clinical signs are similar to those of horses with large colon impactions. Sand may be found in the feces, and auscultation of the ventral abdomen may reveal sounds of sand moving within the large colon.1157 The diagnosis is made via radiography or surgery but may be tentatively based on clinical signs compatible with a large colon impaction and evidence of sand in the feces. Sand sedimentation is performed by mixing feces with water in a rectal palpation sleeve or other container. Abdominal radiographs can be used to detect mineral opacity within the ventral colon.38, 1158 Ultrasonography can also be used to support the diagnosis but is not as accurate as radiography.1159 Abdominal paracentesis is not recommended in suspected cases, because large quantities of sand in the ventral colon make inadvertent perforation of the colon more likely.737\n",

Psyllium is thought to act by stimulating motility or agglutinating the sand. However, one experimental study failed to show a benefit of this treatment.1161 If a severe impaction is present, then psyllium should not be given until the impaction is softened by administering IV or oral fluids and other laxatives. Perforation is a potential complication in horses with sand impactions because the sand stretches and irritates the intestinal wall and causes inflammation.

            "text": "Displacement of the ascending colon is a common cause of large intestinal obstruction. The ascending colon is freely movable except for the right dorsal and ventral colons. Contact with adjacent viscera and the abdominal wall tends to inhibit movement of the ascending colon from a normal position; accumulation of gas and fluid or ingesta, however, may cause the colon to migrate.1162 Feeding behavior, including feeding of large concentrate meals, likely plays a role in initiating displacement of the large colon. Large concentrate meals increase the rate of passage of ingesta, allowing a greater percentage of soluble carbohydrates to reach the large intestine.1163 This in turn increases the rate of fermentation and the amount of gas and volatile fatty acids that are produced. The production of large amounts of volatile fatty acids stimulates the secretion of large volumes of fluid into the colon.2 The association between feeding concentrate and development of displacements of the large colon is illustrated by studies indicating that ascending colon displacement is more prevalent in horses fed a high-concentrate, low-roughage diet.1164 Abnormal motility patterns of the ascending colon may also contribute to the development of colonic displacement. Feeding stimulates colonic motility by way of the gastrocolic reflex, but large meals may alter normal motility patterns and concurrently allow rapid accumulation of gas and fluid resulting from fermentation.1163, 1165 Migration of parasite larvae (strongyles) through the intestinal wall also alters colonic motility patterns.650\nS. vulgaris infection results in reduced blood flow to segments of the large intestine without necessarily causing infarction. Electrical activity of the colon and cecocolic junction increases after infection with S. vulgaris and cyathostome larvae, probably reflecting a direct effect of migration through the intestine and an early response to reduced blood flow.650\n",

The colon may become entrapped by migrating dorsally between the left abdominal wall and the spleen or may migrate in a caudodorsal direction over the nephrosplenic ligament.1166 Occasionally, the ascending colon can be palpated between the spleen and abdominal wall, lending support to the first mechanism of displacement. Gastric distention is thought to predispose horses to left dorsal displacement of the ascending colon by displacing the spleen medially, allowing the colon room to migrate along the abdominal wall.1166 Right dorsal displacement begins by movement of the colon cranially, either medial (medial flexion) or lateral (lateral flexion) to the cecum. According to one author, the proportion of right dorsal displacements with medial versus lateral flexion is approximately 1:15.1166 In either case the pelvic flexure ends up adjacent to the diaphragm. Retroflexion of the ascending colon occurs by movement of the pelvic flexure cranially without movement of the sternal or diaphragmatic flexures.",

The heart rate may be increased in conjunction with abdominal pain but is often normal. Abdominal distention may be present, and fecal production is reduced. Left dorsal displacements are often diagnosed by rectal palpation, because the ascending colon can be traced to the nephrosplenic space, and the spleen may be displaced medially. Alternatively, a tentative diagnosis can be reached using abdominal ultrasonography.1167 The spleen can be imaged on the left side of the abdomen, but the left kidney will be obscured by gas-distended bowel. Evaluation of this technique indicates that there are very few instances of false-positive results, although false-negative results may occasionally occur.1167 A definitive diagnosis may require surgery. Right dorsal displacements are characterized by the presence of the distended ventral colon running across the pelvic inlet and may be felt between the cecum and the body wall if a lateral flexion is present. The pelvic flexure is usually not palpable. Retroflexion of the ascending colon may produce a palpable kink in the colon. If the displaced colons are not distended by gas in the instance of right dorsal displacement and retroflexion, the ascending colon may not be palpable and is conspicuous by its absence from a normal position. Horses with right dorsal displacement often have an increased GGT, relative to horses with left dorsal displacement, which is presumptively caused by compression of the bile duct and temporary extrahepatic obstruction.17\n",

In one study the key risk factor for impaction of this segment of the intestine was diarrhea.1178 This paradoxic finding may be explained by edema of the colonic mucosa associated with proinflammatory causes of diarrheal disease that is usually noted in the ascending colon but may extend into the transverse and small colons. Once diarrheal disease is initiated, large volumes of ingesta are rapidly expelled from the ascending colon into the small colon, which has a far smaller diameter, especially if it is edematous. This may result in the initial appearance of diarrhea, followed by intermittent episodes of colic that may be explained by impaction. Diagnosis is by rectal examination, during which the rectum typically feels edematous and gritty. The most important point to remember is that horses should be closely assessed for impaction even if diarrheal disease is present. Other parameters that are typically helpful for assessing the severity of colic, such as heart rate, are not predictive of obstruction in horses with small colon impaction.1178 Horses may be treated medically during the early stages with fluids, laxatives, and analgesics. The key clinical sign that indicates the need for surgery appears to be abdominal distention, associated with distention of the large colon. Other clinical signs, such as elevations in heart rate and refractory colic, are less pronounced in this disease. Postdiarrheal disease is not the only form of small colon impaction.

Homozygous foals have aganglionosis of the submucosal and myenteric ganglia of the distal portion of the ileum and large intestine, and extrinsic innervation of the ileum and pelvic flexure has been identified.1183, 1184 This results in a foal that appears normal at birth but develops signs of intestinal ileus and colic within 12 to 24 hours.

The horse is anisognathic\u2014that is, the distance between the mandibular teeth is narrower (one-third) than the distance between the upper cheek teeth. This anatomic arrangement affects the inclination of the dental arcade as the jaws slide across each other in the food preparation process. The unworn upper cheek tooth presents a surface with two undulating and narrow ridges, one of which is lateral and the other medial. On the rostral and lingual side of the medial style is an extra hillock. The central portion of these surfaces is indented by two depressions that are comparable with, but much deeper than, the infundibula of the incisor teeth. When the teeth have been subjected to wear, the enamel that closed the ridges is worn through and the underlying dentin appears on the surface. After a time the chewing surface displays a complicated pattern that may be likened to the outline of an ornate letter B, and the upright stroke of the B is on the lingual aspect. Dentin supports the enamel internally, cementum supports the enamel lakes, and the peripheral cementum fills in the spaces between the teeth so that all six teeth may function as a single unit\u2014that is, the dental arcade. Transverse ridges cross each tooth so that the entire maxillary arcade consists of a serrated edge. The serrations are formed so that a valley is present at the area of contact with adjacent teeth. These serrations match fitting serrations on the mandibular arcade. One should note that the mediolateral mandibular motion while chewing pellets does not provide full occlusal contact as it does when chewing hay.1187\n",

Swallowing begins as the food bolus contacts the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal walls. During swallowing, the soft palate elevates to close the nasopharynx, the base of the tongue elevates, and the hyoid bone and the larynx move rostrally following contraction of the hyoid muscles. During this process, the rima glottidis closes and the epiglottis tilts dorsally and caudally to protect the airway so that food is swept through lateral food channels around the sides of the larynx into the laryngoesophagus. Fluoroscopic studies in nursing foals in the dorsoventral view showed that contact occurs between the lateral food channels in the midline so that in outline the food bolus achieves a bow-tie shape.1188\n",

            "text": "Dysphagia is defined as a difficulty or inability to swallow. Anatomic classifications for dysphagia include prepharyngeal, pharyngeal, and esophageal (postpharyngeal) dysphagias. The site of the cause for dysphagia influences the clinical signs. Prepharyngeal dysphagia is characterized by dropping food (quidding) or water from the mouth, reluctance to chew, hypersalivation, or abnormalities in prehension. Pharyngeal and esophageal dysphagias are characterized by coughing; nasal discharge containing saliva, water, or food material; gagging; anxiousness; and neck extension during attempts to swallow. The following section describes esophageal dysphagia in more detail. Causes of dysphagia can be divided into four types: painful, muscular, neurologic, or obstructive (Table 12.8\n). Pain and obstruction cause dysphagia by interfering with the mechanics of prehension, bolus formation and transfer to the pharynx, and deglutition. Muscular and neurologic causes of dysphagia impede prehension and swallowing by affecting the motor function of the lingual or buccal musculature, muscles of mastication (temporal and masseters), and pharyngeal and cranial esophageal muscles. Sensory loss to the lips, buccal mucous membranes, pharynx, or tongue also may cause dysphagia. Neurologic causes of dysphagia may affect the forebrain, brainstem, or peripheral nerves that control prehension (cranial nerves Vm, Vs, VII, and XII), transfer of the food bolus to the pharynx (cranial nerves Vs and XII), and swallowing (cranial nerves IX and X). The latter point was classical thinking, but recent evidence suggests that, while stimulation of cranial nerve IX stimulates swallowing, bilateral blockade of that nerve does not prevent normal swallowing of either liquid or solid material.1189\n",

Adjustments may be necessary for horses that are cachectic or have extra metabolic demand (such as pregnancy). Adding corn oil to the ration (1 cup every 12 or 24 hours) is a common method of increasing fed calories. Equine-specific enteral formulations are also available (Well-Gel, Land O\u2019Lakes Purina Feed LLC, Arden Hills, MN).

Saliva contains high concentrations of Na, K, and Cl. A group of ponies with experimental esophagostomies1193 and a horse with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma1194 were fed a complete pelleted diet through esophagostomy tubes but developed metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia apparently because of salivary losses. Surprisingly, salivary losses of potassium did not result in hypokalemia in these cases, presumably because of replacement in the diet. Electrolyte replacement may be accomplished by adding NaCl and KCl to the diet.

The initiation of inflammatory pulp changes may be a sequela to dental impaction or dental caries or may result from fracture of a tooth. If the onset of the inflammatory process is slow, then formation of secondary dentin within the pulp chambers may protect the pulp and the tooth. Secondary dentin formation occurs from stimulation of odontoblasts within the pulp chamber. Such changes are the normal process of protection during dental wear and attrition as crown substances wear away and the reserve crown comes into wear. In acute disease, however, this defense mechanism is ineffective, and the changes that occur and that are sequelae to pulpitis reflect the location of each affected tooth. For example, pulpitis and apical osteitis of the third mandibular cheek tooth most commonly results in the development of a mandibular dental fistula. Pulpitis of the third maxillary cheek tooth, however, results in an inflammatory disease within the rostral maxillary sinus and in development of chronic maxillary sinus empyema.",

Such periodontal changes usually resolve as the permanent dental arcade is established. During normal mastication, the shearing forces generated by the occlusal contact of the cheek teeth essentially clean the teeth of plaque and effectively inhibit deposition of dental calculus. Wherever occlusal contact is ineffective, periodontal changes and calculus buildup occur; for example, the deposition of calculus on the canine teeth of mature geldings and stallions is common. Routine dental prophylaxis forms an important component of maintaining normal occlusal contact, and for this reason arcade irregularities that result in enamel point formation on the buccal edges of the maxillary cheek teeth and the lingual edges of the mandibular cheek teeth should be corrected. These edges may be smoothed annually in horses that are at grass and twice yearly in young horses, aged horses, and stabled horses. Horses at grass have a greater range of occlusal contact and therefore better periodontal hygiene than stabled horses. In stabled horses the range of occlusal contact is narrower, and the formation of enamel points occurs more frequently with subsequent buccal ulceration and the initiation of a cycle of altered occlusal contact and, hence, irregular arcade formation. This process leads to severe forms of periodontal disease and wave mouth formation.",

The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands in the horse and is situated in the space between the ramus of the mandible and the wing of the atlas. The parotid duct is formed at the ventral part of the gland near the facial crest by the union of three or four smaller ducts. The duct leaves the gland above the linguofacial vein, crosses the tendon of the sternocephalicus muscle, and enters the mouth obliquely in the cheek opposite the third upper cheek tooth. The parotic duct orifice is small, but some dilation of the duct and a circular mucous fold (the parotid papillae) exist at this point. The mandibular gland is smaller than the parotid gland and extends from the atlantal fossa to the basihyoid bone. For the most part, the mandibular gland is covered by the parotid gland and by the lower jaw. The mandibular duct is formed by the union of a number of small duct radicles that emerge along the concave edge of the gland and run rostral to the border of the mouth opposite the canine tooth.",

Esophageal obstruction may be caused by primary impactions (simple choke) of roughage, particularly leafy alfalfa hay; coarse grass hay; bedding; and even grass.1216 Prior esophageal trauma or poor mastication caused by dental abnormalities may predispose horses to primary esophageal impaction.1217 \u201cWolfing\u201d or gulping food may precipitate primary impactions, particularly if the horse is exhausted or mildly dehydrated after a long ride or is weakened from chronic debilitation. Impactions also may result from disorders that physically impede the passage of food material and fluid by narrowing the luminal diameter, reduce the compliance of the esophageal wall, or alter the conformation of the esophageal wall such that food material accumulates in a pocket or diverticulum. Foreign bodies, intramural or extramural masses, or acquired or congenital anomalies cause these so-called secondary impactions. Intramural causes of esophageal obstruction include tumors (squamous cell carcinoma [SCC]), strictures, diverticula, and cysts.1218, 1219, 1220, 1221, 1222, 1223, 1224, 1225, 1226 Mediastinal or cervical masses (tumors or abscesses) may cause extramural obstructions.

Careful lavage of the esophagus with water via an uncuffed or a cuffed nasogastric tube while the head is lowered may be a useful aid in breaking up the impaction. Some clinicians advocate a dual tube method in which a tube is placed through each nasal passage into the esophagus for ingress and egress of the lavage fluid. Because of the risk of aspiration of water and food material, esophageal lavage sometimes is done under general anesthesia with a cuffed nasotracheal tube. In refractory cases, IV administration of polyionic fluids provides hydration and alleviates any electrolyte or acid-base imbalances resulting from salivary losses of chloride, sodium, and potassium.1193 Oxytocin may or may not provide a direct effect for the resolution of an esophageal obstruction. Oxytocin reduced the area under the curve for esophageal smooth muscle strip contractions but had no effect on skeletal muscle strips in vitro.1234 In one in vivo report, oxytocin administration resulted in decreased esophageal tone in the proximal esophagus (aborad to the larynx and thoracic inlet).1233 In a separate study, oxytocin administration did not affect esophageal manometric recordings.1235 Rarely, esophageal obstruction ultimately may require esophagotomy to relieve the impaction. Strict restriction of food and water, including access to bedding material, must be enforced until the obstruction is resolved and the esophagus has regained function. Surgical removal of esophageal foreign bodies can be considered if the size and/or orientation of the object is such that transendoscopic retrieval is considered unlikely to be successful.1226, 1236 In one report, an intraluminal mass comprised of exuberant granulation tissue was removed via serial transendoscopic Nd:YAG laser ablation.1237\n",

Strictures may also originate in the muscular layers and adventitia of the esophagus (mural strictures) or in all of the layers of the esophagus (annular stenosis).1217, 1250 Horses with these lesions have a presentation similar to those with simple obstructions, because strictures result in partial obstruction and impaction of food material in the lumen. Esophageal webs or rings may be detected with endoscopy (see Fig. 12.15, Fig. 12.16), whereas identification of mural strictures or annular stenosis may require a double-contrast esophagram (see Fig. 12.17). In a retrospective study of horses with esophageal stricture following simple obstruction, maximal reduction in esophageal lumen diameter occurred within 30 days of the esophageal obstruction.

Balloon dilation has been used successfully in several reports.1251, 1252, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256 Commercial balloon dilators have been adapted for use in the horse, although it is important to note that repeated dilation is necessary.1251, 1252, 1257 Corticosteroid injection was used successfully in conjunction with this procedure in foals.1251 Alternatively, a number of surgical techniques have been used to resolve strictures, including resection and anastomosis,1258, 1259 temporary esophagostomy with fenestration of the stricture,1217 esophagomyotomy for strictures of the muscularis and adventitia,1260, 1261 or patch grafting with local musculature.1262 Such surgeries, however, are fraught with complications, largely because of the propensity of the traumatized esophagus to restricture.1220, 1249 The esophagus lacks a serosal layer and does not rapidly form a fibrin seal as does the remainder of the intestinal tract, so anastomoses tend to leak.1259 In addition, tension on the esophagus during swallowing and movement of the neck impairs healing of anastomoses.1217, 1258 In spite of these difficulties, the long-term prognosis for horses with chronic esophageal strictures treated surgically is better than for those treated nonsurgically.1220 Two recent reviews describe surgical approaches to the esophagus in detail.1263, 1264\n",

Systemic inflammation from septic cellulitis may occur. Closed perforations of the esophagus are particularly troublesome because food material, water, saliva, and air may migrate to the mediastinum and pleural space via fascial planes.1240, 1281 Because of the leakage of air into the tissues surrounding the rupture, extensive SC and fascial emphysema frequently develops and is usually evident clinically and on cervical radiographs. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are potentially fatal complications of esophageal ruptures.

Alternatively, a small nasogastric tube (12-Fr diameter) may be placed.1240 For open perforations, once the wound has granulated and contracted to a small size, oral feeding may be attempted.1281 Extensive loss of saliva via esophageal wounds may lead to hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Transient metabolic acidosis may occur because of salivary bicarbonate loss, followed by progressive metabolic alkalosis.1193 Although reports of esophageal wounds healing well by second intention exist, healing takes a prolonged time.1283 In addition, some perforations never completely heal and form permanent esophagocutaneous fistulae that may require surgical correction. The development of esophageal strictures is not common because wounds are usually linear and not circumferential. However, traction diverticula may develop.

The predominant stimuli to hydrochloric acid secretion are gastrin, histamine, and acetylcholine via the vagus nerve.1313 Gastrin is released by G cells within the antral mucosa, whereas histamine is released by mast cells and ECL-like cells in the gastric gland. Histamine binds to type 2 receptors on the parietal cell membrane, causing an increase in adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), resulting in phosphorylation of enzymes that activate the proton pump. Gastrin and acetylcholine can act via calcium-mediated intracellular pathways and also stimulate histamine release directly.1314 Isolated equine parietal cells respond maximally to histamine stimulation and only minimally to carbachol and pentagastrin.1315 In vivo, histamine or pentagastrin infusion can stimulate similar maximal acid output.1316 Interestingly, pentagastrin stimulation also induces a marked duodenal secretion of a sodium chloride\u2013rich fluid, which can reflux back into the stomach under fasting conditions.1316 Gastrin release is primarily controlled by gastrin-releasing peptide, which is stimulated by gastric distention and increased luminal pH, but the interaction between gastrin and histamine has not been fully elucidated in the horse.",

In older foals with GDUD, detection of gastric outflow obstruction is critical to the therapeutic plan and appropriate prognosis. A distended stomach is typically evident with ultrasound. Abdominal radiography without contrast in foals with outflow obstruction typically reveals a distinctly enlarged, gas-filled stomach. Liquid barium contrast will either have markedly delayed (with incomplete obstruction) or no (complete obstruction) outflow. Clinically, foals with outflow obstruction will develop reflux after suckling, or marked reflux even with limited to no suckling if the duodenal obstruction is distal to the common bile duct.",

Because some critically ill foals have a predominantly alkaline gastric pH profile, and because gastric acidity may be protective against bacterial translocation in neonates, the need for prophylactic ulcer therapy is controversial. In critically ill human neonates, although IV ranitidine therapy increases gastric pH and gastric bacterial colonization, it does not increase the risk of sepsis.1384 In a retrospective study of 85 hospitalized foals <30 days of age, no difference in the frequency of gastric ulceration at necropsy was found between those foals that received prophylactic treatment for gastric ulcers and those that did not; none died as a result of gastric ulcer disease.1341 In a multicenter retrospective study, acid prophylaxis was associated with an increased incidence of diarrhea but not with alteration in clinical outcome.1385 Many clinicians no longer recommend routine ulcer prophylaxis in all ill neonates. Exceptions could potentially include those foals requiring significant doses of NSAIDs for painful orthopedic disorders.",

Depending on the cause and severity of disease, gastric endoscopy may provide a presumptive diagnosis in the adult horse. Measurement of gastric emptying can aid the diagnosis.

In horses with rupture caused by gastric dilatation, tears in the seromuscular layer are frequently larger than the corresponding tears in the mucosal layer, indicating that the seromuscularis likely weakens and tears before the mucosa.1399, 1401 In contrast, horses with gastric rupture secondary to gastric ulceration usually demonstrate full-thickness tears of equal size in all layers. Gastric rupture is usually fatal because of widespread contamination of the peritoneal cavity, septic peritonitis, and septic shock. Initial clinical signs vary with the primary disease; however, when rupture occurs, an animal previously in pain can exhibit signs of relief. Subsequent signs are consistent with peritonitis and shock, including tachypnea, tachycardia, sweating, and muscle fasciculations. Surgical repair is difficult but has been reported for partial-thickness tears,1402 and, in one case of a combined tear of the mucosa and muscularis with only a focal serosal tear, a full-thickness repair was performed with a favorable outcome.1403\n",

Although a specific cause is not always evident, ingestion of coarse roughage (straw bedding and poor-quality forage), foreign objects (rubber fencing material), and feed that may swell after ingestion or improper mastication (persimmon seeds, mesquite beans, wheat, barley, and sugar beet pulp) has been implicated.1404, 1405, 1406, 1407 Possible predisposing factors include poor dentition, poor mastication and rapid consumption of feedstuffs, and inadequate water consumption. Clinical signs can vary from anorexia and weight loss to those consistent with severe abdominal pain. In severe cases, spontaneous reflux may occur, with gastric contents visible at the nares. In cases presenting with acute severe abdominal pain, a diagnosis is often made during exploratory celiotomy. In animals not exhibiting signs of colic warranting surgical intervention, an endoscopic finding of a full stomach after a normally adequate fast (18\u201324 hours) can often confirm the diagnosis. Abdominal radiographs are reserved for smaller horses and ponies. In addition to pain management, specific treatment consists of gastric lavage via nasogastric intubation or massage and injection of fluid to soften the impaction during laparotomy.1404, 1405, 1406\n",

Abnormal masses were palpable rectally in 4 of 5 cases of gastric SCC.1416 Most discussions of SCC treatment about the head are based on dermal, ocular, and adnexal SCC, which are more common. Available treatment includes surgical resection, iridium-192 brachytherapy, 5-fluorouracil, and intralesional cisplatin or carboplatin.1437, 1438, 1439, 1440, 1441 The prognosis for survival is good if complete resection is possible, although it typically is not for gastric SCC.1423 Local recurrence is possible. One report of recurring SCC on the lip with metastasis to the lymph nodes was successfully treated with piroxicam over 58 months.1442 Hypertrophic osteopathy secondary to gastric SCC has been documented in one horse.1443\n",

Salmonellae infect epithelial cells, stimulating the production of chemokines (interleukin-8 [IL-8]), cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1]), and other proinflammatory mediators. Endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory mediators produce chemoattractants (such as IL-8) and display adhesion molecules that promote neutrophil emigration. The three steps of neutrophil (polymorphonuclear [PMN]) emigration capture/rolling (mediated by selectins), adhesion (mediated by \u03b22 integrins), and transendothelial migration (mediated by integrins and platelet/endothelial cellular adhesion molecule) occur on activated endothelium. Chemoattractant molecules such as IL-8 trigger neutrophil emigration. In inflamed tissues cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) and a variety of other proinflammatory mediators stimulate the neutrophil oxidase complex to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs; O2\u2212 and H2O2 and their derivatives). Activated neutrophils degranulate to release proteases and other hydrolases, cationic peptides (defensins), myeloperoxidase, and other products into the tissue. Activated neutrophils synthesize a variety of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins (PGE2) that modulate the inflammatory response. The products of activated neutrophils (ROIs, proteases, and mediators) stimulate epithelial secretion and alter tight junction permeability, promoting diarrhea. Neutrophils eventually migrate across the infected epithelium by a mechanism that involves integrins, disrupting tight junction integrity and increasing permeability to bacterial products, thus exacerbating the inflammatory response.",
