In many of these time-delay models, bifurcations occur as values of parameters are changed. For example, Andronov\u2013Hopf bifurcations can occur in differential equation systems and Neimark\u2013Sacker bifurcations can occur in difference equation systems at critical values of time delays. In some cases, the changes in system parameters can also lead to chaotic-type solutions (see, e.g. [17, 18]).",

However, as the growth rate of diseases (such as HIV) or other kinds of populations (such as fish or animal populations) can be a slow process or the collection of data may often only be carried out at regular intervals such as a month or a year, it is often only possible to construct difference equation models. One method that is often used to construct a difference equation model is to use a first-order Euler method to approximate the differential equation model [1, 2, 19\u201322]. This method is also often used to solve It\u00f3 stochastic differential equations as, for example, in the Euler\u2013Mayurama method [1, 23].",

This model includes the effects of vertical HIV transmission from mother to baby, the effects of births and deaths and of treatment by antivirals. The second system is an extended logistic growth model (ELM) that has been applied to forecasting short lifecycle products and services by Trappey and Wu [27], and to growth of single-species populations by He et al.

For each model, we first investigate the properties of the seven different versions of differential equation models and prove conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov\u2013Hopf bifurcations at critical values of the time delays. We then investigate the properties of discretized versions of the models and prove conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Neimark\u2013Sacker bifurcations at critical values of the time delays. We show that both differential equation and difference equation models may have bifurcations from both disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. For the disease-free equilibrium, four of the seven different versions satisfy the bifurcation conditions, and for the endemic equilibrium five of the seven versions have bifurcations. For the bifurcations from the endemic equilibrium points, we show that for each version with bifurcations the critical delay times for Neimark\u2013Sacker bifurcations are less than the critical times for Andronov\u2013Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization in the discretized model tends to zero. Numerical simulations are presented for a range of parameter values to illustrate the analytical results. Applications of the results are given to the modeling of HIV transmission and to the modeling of populations.",
