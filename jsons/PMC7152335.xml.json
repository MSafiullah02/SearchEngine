The rate of late-onset sepsis is strongly and inversely associated with birth weight and gestational age, decreasing from about 60% among neonates with a gestational age of less than 25 weeks to 20% among infants born at 28 weeks' gestation.6 Consequently, institutions caring for more extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants have higher rates. Management practices, particularly those concerning the use and maintenance care of central venous catheters (CVCs) or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), can further impact these rates of infection.7\n",

Phillips and Karlowicz1 reported a case series of 60 UTIs among NICU patients, primarily documented through specimens obtained by urethral catheterization when late-onset sepsis was suspected. Simultaneous BSIs with the same pathogen were detected in 52% of cases of Candida UTI and 8% of cases of bacterial UTI. Because most VLBW infants with UTI do not have a BSI, it is our practice to obtain urine for culture by sterile urethral catheterization or by suprapubic aspiration, when late-onset sepsis is suspected.",
