            "text": "Early stages of the viral infection cycle require attachment and entry of viruses into the host cell. Classically, virus attachment is mediated by the specific binding of viral surface proteins to host cell receptor molecules, concentrating virus at the cell plasma membrane. Viruses are often studded with one or multiple surface proteins, each potentially containing numerous subdomains, to promote interaction with cellular receptors and stimulate virus entry into the cell. However, the virus surface is also a highly antigenic structure that can trigger cellular and humoral immune responses that eradicate virus in the host. Antibodies contribute to several levels of antiviral defense effectively to neutralize the virus and reduce infectivity. They neutralize infection by targeting viral glycoproteins (GP) of enveloped viruses or the protein shell of non\u2010enveloped viruses. In enveloped viruses, they may either block virion binding to cellular receptors, interfere with the fusion machinery or aggregate virus particles; in non\u2010enveloped viruses, they may prevent uncoating of the viral genome in the endosome or promote cytosolic degradation of incoming virions through a tripartite motif\u2010containing protein 21 proteasome pathway 1. Two models have been proposed to describe the kinetics of neutralization. The first is a single\u2010hit model, postulating that binding of a single antibody molecule to a critical site on the virion is sufficient to neutralize the virus, while the second, more widely accepted, multi\u2010hit model proposes that neutralization is only achieved once an individual virion is bound by a number of antibodies which exceeds the stoichiometric threshold of neutralization 2. As the number of available epitopes for a specific antibody on the virion is known, the stoichiometry of neutralization can be calculated. However, the stoichiometric threshold of neutralization is determined by antibody affinity and epitope accessibility. For example, antibodies specific to poorly accessible epitopes require a higher concentration to exceed the occupancy threshold for neutralization 3.",

            "text": "Paradoxically however, for some time it has been recognized that sub\u2010neutralizing concentrations of antibodies, under certain conditions, can act to enhance viral infection by aiding viral entry into target cells. This mechanism of improved virus uptake, termed antibody\u2010dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, is thought to occur when virus is bound by non\u2010neutralizing antibodies or sub\u2010neutralizing concentrations of antibodies that facilitate cell entry in an Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R)\u2010dependent manner. Interaction of the protruding antibody Fc of the antibody\u2013virus immunocomplex with the Fc\u03b3R on myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and certain granulocytes typically leads to phagocytosis, resulting in increased numbers of infected cells \u2013 so\u2010called extrinsic ADE. This form of ADE therefore requires prior sensitization of the humoral immune response, whereby circulating antibodies produced during primary infection recognize and bind to a heterologous serotype of the virus and enhance viral infectivity through internalization of virus\u2013antibody immunocomplexes by cells bearing Fc\u03b3R, rather than promoting viral neutralization. Once internalized, these immunocomplexes may modulate innate antiviral cells responses to increase virus production substantially in each cell, a process termed intrinsic ADE. Together, extrinsic and intrinsic ADE are thought to prompt the massive release of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators that ultimately contribute to disease severity. Throughout this review we will refer to ADE as the overall process of ADE of infection, and will use the terms \u2018intrinsic\u2019 and \u2018extrinsic\u2019 when referring specifically to those mechanistic processes.",

A number of viruses from the Flaviviridae and Togaviridae families showed enhanced infectivity when assayed with dilutions of their respective antisera. Later work on fractionated sera confirmed that this enhancement was principally associated with IgG antibodies, which were able to act as a molecular bridge between the virus and Fc\u03b3R\u2010expressing cells capable of binding the Fc portion of IgG 5. In a series of reports, Halstead et al. first examined the pathogenic potential of Fc\u03b3R\u2010dependent ADE to cause dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in dengue virus (DENV) infection. Through epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro modeling, Halstead et al. established not only the link between severe forms of DENV infection in individuals who have had a previous dengue infection but also the enhanced infectivity of target cells and disease exacerbation caused by DENV antibody opsonins 6, 7, 8. Since then, much of the research surrounding viral ADE has focused on members of the Flaviviridae family, particularly DENV, driven by the lack of a licensed DENV vaccine and effective antiviral agents to treat DENV infection. ADE of infection has been implicated as a major obstacle to vaccine development for a number of viruses that cause a significant human health threat, including DENV.",

            "text": "In 1983, an additional, separate mechanism of extrinsic ADE was identified involving the classical complement pathway. Again identified using a flavivirus, studies found that complement receptor 3 (CR3) was able to mediate IgM\u2010dependent enhancement of West Nile virus (WNV) infectivity in macrophages 9. Further forms of complement\u2010mediated ADE were subsequently described in a number of virus\u2010cell systems including human immunodeficiency virus\u20101 (HIV\u20101). Enhanced HIV\u20101 infection of T\u2010lymphoblastoid cell lines in the presence of sub\u2010neutralizing levels of HIV\u2010specific antibodies was shown to require high levels of CR2 and CD4 expression 10. Although the mechanisms are not thought to be mutually exclusive to enhancing infectivity, complement\u2010dependent ADE is distinct from Fc\u03b3R\u2010dependent ADE. In addition to CR2\u2010 and CR3\u2010mediated ADE, a further independent route of complement\u2010mediated ADE of HIV\u20101 infection was shown to require the complement component C1q 11. Interaction of C1q with virus\u2010antibody immunocomplexes enhanced productive HIV\u20101 infection in vitro. A similar mechanism of C1q\u2010mediated ADE was reported to enhance infection with Ebola virus in non\u2010monocytic cells by promoting binding virus attachment to the target cell or endocytosis 12. Here, IgG antibodies were reported to bind viral epitopes in close proximity, allowing C1q to bind the Fc portion of the antibodies, with the immunocomplex binding C1q receptors at the cell surface. Enhanced infection of HIV opsonized with complement alone has also been reported.",

            "text": "As with other forms of ADE, complement\u2010dependent ADE of infection has also been linked to viral pathogenesis. In HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients, levels of enhancing antibody in complement\u2010restored serum samples correlated with immunosuppression and disease 13. Moreover, a greater variety of cell types express complement receptors than do Fc\u03b3R, which are generally restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage. It may therefore be possible for complement\u2010dependent ADE to cause aberrant viral infection of what are typically thought of as non\u2010target cells. In turn, infection of non\u2010target cells as a result of complement\u2010dependent ADE may be a precursor of viral pathogenesis or the atypical and often severe disease symptoms associated with chronic or recurrent viral infection. Indeed, enhanced uptake of human parvovirus B19 into endothelial cells of the myocardium, likely due to ADE mediated by complement factor C1q and its receptor CD93, is associated with acute and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathies 14. Therefore, despite its strong host tropism for erythroid progenitor cells, complement\u2010dependent ADE of human parvovirus B19 confers up to a 4000\u2010fold increase in virus endothelial cell uptake in the presence of human parvovirus B19\u2010specific antibodies.",

Only recently have studies begun to investigate the upstream and downstream molecular signaling events that surround all forms of viral ADE. In light of current data, to be discussed in this review, the effect of these signaling cascades on innate cellular immunity and viral pathogenesis continues to be the focus of research efforts and highlights the recent advances made in the development of permissive model systems with which to examine the role of FcR in mediating viral ADE and FcR\u2010targeted therapeutic strategies for treatment of viral pathogenesis.",

Recently, the world has been hit by waves of mosquito\u2010transmitted diseases caused by alphavirus and flavivirus infections. Arthritogenic alphaviruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ross River virus (RRV), and Sindbis virus (SINV) cause febrile illness and myalgias with polyarthralgias as the clinical hallmark, which can last for months to years after infection 15, 16, 17. RRV and SINV are endemic to Australia and Europe, respectively, while CHIKV causes large outbreaks in many parts of the world including the Americas, Africa, South\u2010East Asia, India, and Oceania, affecting millions of individuals worldwide 18, 19, 20. Moreover, DENV and WNV are prominent flaviviruses that are major health concerns due to the severity of diseases they cause. DENV has a geographical distribution similar to CHIKV, causing massive worldwide outbreaks, with an estimated 390 million people suffering from DENV infections annually 21, 22. DENV infection is typically self\u2010limiting; however, in some cases of infection, the disease manifests a more complicated and severe form where patients may suffer from plasma leakage and shock syndrome. Unattended severe cases of DENV infection can lead to a mortality rate of 20% 23. In contrast to DENV, WNV is endemic to the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Middle East 24. Although approximately 80% of WNV infections are subclinical, symptomatic infections known as WNV fever can persist for months post infection. A few \u2013 <1% of these patients \u2013 develop severe neurological complications that may be fatal 25. Whether this is associated with ADE is not known.",

The persistence of alphavirus within macrophages during the late phase of infection suggested the likely occurrence of ADE 30, 31. Indeed, several studies on RRV demonstrated ADE in macrophages. Serum recovered from RRV\u2010infected patients contains anti\u2010RRV antibodies, which, when diluted to sub\u2010neutralizing levels, promoted infection of the less\u2010permissive monocytic cell lines U937 and Mono Mac 6 and enhanced RRV infection in the highly permissive macrophage cell lines J774A.1 and RAW264.7 32. In addition, infection of FcR\u2010expressing J774A.1 and RAW264.7 cells led to persistent virus production up to 50 days post infection. Further mechanistic studies by Lidbury et al. shed light on the role of the RRV\u2010induced ADE pathway in modulating host transcription and translation. Immune responses triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in macrophage cell cultures prior to RRV infection significantly reduced RRV replication. However, RRV infection in the presence of anti\u2010RRV antibody abolished the LPS\u2010induced antiviral effects, allowing RRV\u2010ADE infection of cells and increased virus replication 33. This phenomenon was due to the inhibition of transcription factors nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)1 and, paradoxically, as expression of these is usually driven through NF\u2010\u03baB, translational expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates. Downstream studies further identified that active viral replication during RRV\u2010ADE infection is crucial for the suppression of LPS\u2010induced activation of transcription factor protein complexes IRF9 and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1, as well as elevation of interleukin (IL)\u201010 expression 34.",

Halstead and O'Rourke first identified ADE of DENV infection, observing that non\u2010DENV susceptible human\u2010 or rhesus monkey\u2010derived primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could be successfully infected with DENV in the presence of a high dilution of anti\u2010DENV antibody 37. Cross\u2010reactivity of anti\u2010DENV antibodies generated from exposure to different DENV serotypes was later shown to mediate ADE 38. The occurrence of ADE has long been associated with the severity of DENV disease pathogenesis, giving rise to severe forms of disease \u2013 DHF and DSS \u2013 typically during secondary infections 23, most commonly in the order of DENV\u20101 followed by secondary infection with DENV\u20102 or DENV\u20103 39, 40, 41. As discussed in more detail later, primary DENV infection of infants who have non\u2010neutralizing titers of anti\u2010DENV antibodies acquired through maternal transmission from a DENV\u2010immune mother, has reportedly led to severe DHF 42, 43. Other evidence of ADE exacerbating DENV infection was reported by Moi et al., where serum specimens were collected from DENV patients during primary or secondary infections. Virus titers measured in serum specimens from secondary DENV\u2010infected patients were approximately 10\u2010fold higher than those in the serum of patients with primary infection, detected using Fc\u03b3R\u2010expressing BHK cells 44.",

This has been illustrated by the global impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) outbreak in 2003 48, 49. Equally concerning are confirmed human cases of avian influenza in many countries, particularly across Asia, with the H7N7 strain of avian influenza that has jumped into humans in China 50, 51, 52, the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic 53, as well as a novel coronavirus that is the causative agent of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\u2010CoV) 54. These events have triggered scores of investigations to gain insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severity of symptoms and high fatality rates of SARS, MERS, and avian influenza. One of the concepts that has driven research in this area has been the recognition that the host immune system, which is essential to clear infections, may sometimes mediate excessive and dysregulated responses contributing to more severe clinical symptoms and prognosis in affected individuals. These immunopathological responses are exemplified by the so\u2010called cytokine storm that is triggered by the highly pathogenic avian influenza and is considered to be one of the primary causes of the severity of the Spanish flu pandemic 55, 56, 57. The pathology in SARS patients also appears to be at least partially immune\u2010mediated and, therefore, several studies have investigated whether the host immune response may be involved in the development of severe respiratory diseases 58, 59.",

It is usually agreed that SARS\u2010CoV, in addition to infection of the respiratory tract, may also directly infect immune cells, which do not express the angiotensin I\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor that recognizes the SARS\u2010CoV spike protein to mediate virus entry 61, 62. This raises the possibility that antibody\u2010mediated entry may provide SARS\u2010CoV with an opportunity to broaden its target options. This possibility was first suggested in a study describing that a SARS\u2010CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full\u2010length SARS\u2010CoV spike protein \u2013 the major antigenic protein of the four virus structural proteins inducing neutralizing and protective antibodies 63, 64 \u2013 triggered infection of human B cell lines despite eliciting a neutralizing and protective immune response in rodents 65.

In addition to monocytes, human macrophages were also infected by SARS\u2010CoV in the presence of anti\u2010spike antibodies.

In vitro infection by SARS\u2010CoV opsonized with anti\u2010spike serum was enhanced via Fc\u03b3RIIa and, to a lesser extent Fc\u03b3RIIb1 68. Similarly, infection of primary feline macrophages was enhanced when feline infectious peritonitis virus was opsonized with anti\u2010spike antibody and abrogated by blocking antibodies against Fc receptor 71, 72. Construction of truncated and chimeric FcR molecules further revealed that binding of SARS\u2010CoVpp to cells via the extracellular domain of Fc\u03b3Rs is not sufficient to trigger ADE of infection as entry requires an intact intracellular domain 68. Although the relationship between internalization of immune complexes and ADE infection by SARS\u2010CoV via Fc\u03b3RIIs appears to be a complex process, the observation of a change in tropism of SARS\u2010CoV in the presence of antiviral immune serum distinguishes the ADE of SARS\u2010CoV infection from many other examples of antibody\u2010mediated viral infection, where the presence of antiviral antibodies increases the viral load due to infection of a higher number of already susceptible cells 69. Of note, neutralization of the endosomal acidic pH led to exacerbation of the antibody\u2010mediated infection 66, in contrast to that previously described for SARS\u2010CoV infection mediated by its receptor, ACE2 73. It is possible that viral particles infecting cells through the ADE pathway remain trapped in an acidic compartment and the inhibition of endosomal acidification prevents their degradation or, alternatively, that the ability of Spike to mediate cell membrane fusion at neutral pH 74 could allow more antibody\u2010opsonized SARS\u2010CoVpp to fuse with the endosomal membranes. Regardless of the mechanism, the biochemical requirements of Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated infection are markedly distinct from those underlying virus receptor\u2010dependent entry and illustrate a novel mechanism in addition to ACE2 by which SARS\u2010CoV can enter target cells.",

Several clinical studies have reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibodies found in SARS patients are not harmful 75, 76, whereas others have observed poor disease outcomes in early seroconverted SARS patients 77, 78. To address this issue directly, it would be necessary to screen SARS patient sera, keeping in mind the possibility that ADE may only occur within a narrow window during the course of an infection and only in a subset of infected patients. One should remain aware, however, of the possible consequences of this alternative infection pathway, as other coronaviruses besides SARS\u2010CoV appear to be able to jump species and vaccination remains one of the few options available to prevent the spread of infections caused by this family of viruses.",

They belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are responsible for a wide range of illnesses. Because of their endemicity, demonstrated pandemic potential, and the annual vaccination of millions of people worldwide, the possible occurrence of ADE has important implications. More than 30 years have passed since the publication of the first study reporting ADE of influenza in an experimental rat model with heterologous challenge following immunization 79. This initial observation was soon followed by similar reports in mouse macrophage cell lines and it was noticed that antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA), the two main structural components of the viral envelope, were able to induce ADE 80, 81. Influenza viruses have 18 HA and 11 NA \u2013 including the distinct lineage of influenza viruses identified in New World bats 82 \u2013 and, therefore, several subtypes were tested, revealing that the enhancing activity was strain\u2010dependent and FcR\u2010mediated 83, 84, 85, 86. Although almost all studies were carried out using mouse cell lines, several instances of increased severity of clinical disease were observed in immunized animals, especially pigs 87 and, more recently, in ferrets 88, 89, the animal model regarded as most accurately reproducing human infection when challenged with a heterologous strain 90. Although it was not directly tested, ADE was presented as the most likely explanation.",

These findings were further extended in a randomized, blinded, placebo\u2010controlled ferret study whose conclusions corroborated the hypothesis of direct, adverse effect of prior administration of the 2008\u20132009 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine on subsequent infection with the 2009 pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm 89.

Infection with different influenza A virus strains showed that both classically and alternatively activated primary human macrophages (M1 and M2, respectively) were permissive to viral infection in the absence of antibody, more so to avian H5N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses than to A(H1N1)pdm.

The virus is a global burden with seasonal epidemics and efforts have been ongoing to curb its incidence with a preventive vaccine. Since the initial demonstration that a formalin\u2010inactivated vaccine actually worsened disease severity in children, the possibility of ADE was considered, as immunized children developed sub\u2010neutralizing antibody titers compared to those of a comparable age who had natural RSV infections and had not been immunized 101. The first hints that ADE could be the underlying mechanism contributing to disease manifestations in some infants came from in vitro studies in which both murine (P388D1) and human (THP1\u2010 and U937) macrophage\u2010like cell lines were used. Thus, two MAbs specific to separate surface GP of RSV and human sera containing virus\u2010specific antibodies were found to enhance RSV infection. Of note, the ability to increase virus titer was greater for convalescent sera and correlated with the antibody titers 102, 103. This phenomenon could be reversed by blocking either the Fc segment of the MAb or the Fc receptor on the cells, suggesting that it involved opsonization of the virus followed by binding of immune complexes to Fc receptors on target cells 103. Collectively, these reports indicate that antibody\u2010mediated enhancement of RSV infection can occur in vitro in macrophages. Further evidence for ADE as a possible mechanism for disease manifestations following immunization with the formalin\u2010inactivated vaccine against RSV was obtained in a macaque model 104. However, several recent studies reporting \u2018vaccine\u2010enhanced disease\u2019 have exonerated ADE 105 and the mechanisms of lung immunopathology following formalin\u2010inactivated vaccination in mice have been ascribed to distinct CD4+ T\u2010cell subsets that orchestrate discrete and specific disease manifestations resulting in the deposition of immune complexes that start in the lung 106. Despite obvious differences in the generation of immunopathology, these two types of antibody\u2010dependent disease share the common trait of being dependent on inadequate responses of the innate immune system triggered by either natural infection or vaccination. Interestingly, a formalin\u2010inactivated vaccine against human metapneumovirus induced immune\u2010mediated disease 107, indicating that this may be a common feature shared by members of the Paramyxoviridae family, including measles virus 108.",

The current Ebola epidemic in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone is the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since this virus was first discovered in 1976, with almost 25 000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and more than 10 000 deaths. With no available treatments of proven efficacy (although several trials are underway), the development of a safe vaccine has become one of the main areas of research. In this context, it is useful to review evidence that immunization with the envelope GP of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus induced an antibody response that enhanced virus infectivity in vitro\n110. Although evidence for the involvement of ADE as a mechanistic explanation for the extreme virulence of Ebola virus is lacking, these observations raised concerns on the development of safe vaccines. A subsequent study revealed that sera from convalescent patients (51\u2013135 days after onset of symptoms) enhanced infection of primate cells 12. On the other hand, two MAbs against the Zaire GP produced diametrically opposite effects, i.e. protection or ADE, and it was concluded that distinct epitopes underlie these features 86, 111. By constructing a chimeric envelope GP in which the epitopes of Zaire strain required for ADE were replaced with corresponding sequences of Reston Ebola virus, which appears to cause only asymptomatic infections in humans 109, the ability to trigger ADE was drastically reduced 111. The enhanced infectivity is mediated by a novel molecular correlate that requires antibodies directed against the envelope GP to interact with the complement factor, C1q. Thus, C1q binds to the antibodies complexed to the virus, thereby favoring interaction with its receptor and, consequently, increasing interactions at the cell surface 111. Because C1 receptors have been identified in most mammalian cells 112, this mechanism extends the range of cells that become susceptible to infection well beyond the range of Fc receptor\u2010expressing cells of the immune system. It has been hypothesized that C1q\u2010dependent ADE may be responsible for the rapid dissemination of the infection to secondary targets with ensuing exacerbation of symptoms. These observations have raised concerns about the development of Ebola virus vaccines based on the envelope GP and the usefulness of passive therapy with convalescent sera 111. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the potential risks and inherent disadvantages in using whole polyclonal serum for passive immune therapy can be overcome with specific and well\u2010characterized MAbs that showed protective efficacy in a non\u2010human primate model of Ebola virus disease 113, 114 and are being currently tested in clinical trials 115. In addition, several vaccine candidates have shown safety in primate models and have been rolled out during the last months of the current Ebola outbreak 116, 117, 118, 119. Vaccinated humans appear to achieve immune responses comparable in magnitude with those associated with protection in non\u2010human primates, suggesting that immunological data could be used to demonstrate vaccine efficacy, although full reports have not yet appeared in the literature. Collectively, these observations suggest that ADE of Ebola may be a complex phenomenon related to the balance between different neutralizing, non\u2010neutralizing, and enhancing antibodies elicited by different immunization protocols.",

Infection\u2010enhancing epitopes are therefore recognized for their potential to contribute to viral pathogenesis. Studies of the antigenic determinants that mediate ADE of enveloped viruses have found overwhelming evidence for the role of epitopes within surface structural proteins. Antibodies generated against the envelope proteins of multiple viruses have been shown to enhance infection in vitro. Examples of such epitopes include the spike protein of SARS\u2010CoV 66, 68, E2 GP of hepatitis C virus 120, GP of Ebola virus 111, transmembrane GP gp41 of HIV 121, and GP 5 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 122. Mutational analysis and epitope mapping has allowed further dissection of the amino acids and domains within these proteins responsible for ADE. Evidence also exists, however, of infection\u2010enhancing antibodies generated against internal structural proteins such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nucleocapsid and DENV premembrane (prM) 122, 123. It seems likely that these proteins, generally concealed by the virus envelope, may stimulate an antigenic response due to an abundant overexpression during natural infection or release of incomplete or immature virions from the cell. Notably also, antibodies against non\u2010structural protein 1 (NS1) can promote endothelial cell damage via antibody\u2010dependent complement\u2010mediated cytolysis, due to the high homology between NS1 of DENV and cell surface molecules on endothelium and platelets, as well as blood coagulation\u2010related molecules 124, 125. NS1 is not expressed on the virion surface, but is detectable on the infected cell surface 126 and in serum 127. With viral serotypes, strains, and even members of the same viral genus or family able to present common epitopes during infection, the potential to generate antibodies capable of ADE\u2010mediated infection enhancement is further increased. ADE of infection is therefore a significant obstacle to the development of effective vaccines for a number of viral pathogens. Understanding of the epitopes responsible for enhancing viral infection can therefore aid development of novel vaccination strategies, for example engineering vaccines that exclusively express neutralizing epitopes.",

Antibodies elicited during primary infection with one serotype, although offering lifelong protection against that serotype, can be sub\u2010neutralizing and cause ADE upon secondary infection with other serotypes. Moreover, within a particular DENV serotype, the diversity of DENV genotypes adds further complexity to the elicited antibody response, with amino acid sequences varying by up to 6%. This is likely to be further exacerbated by the generation of quasispecies in dengue infection 128. Perhaps not surprisingly, the antibody response to DENV infection in humans is predominantly cross\u2010reactive; many are non\u2010neutralizing and have the potential for ADE. In addition, live attenuated DENV vaccine candidates produce a similar humoral response, dominated by serotype cross\u2010reactive weakly neutralizing antibodies, to that seen in DENV infection 129. A safe DENV vaccine must therefore stimulate protection against all DENV serotypes at once, or else risk development of severe forms of the disease, such as DHF, in a secondary infection. Multiple studies have examined the different DENV serotype structures to aid rational design of vaccines that induce neutralizing antibodies while lowering the risk of DHF and DSS. The host\u2010derived DENV membrane is a dynamic structure studded with multiple copies of the multidomain envelope (E) GP, in either dimeric or trimeric conformation, and membrane (M) proteins. Immature virus particles contain trimeric spikes made from heterodimers of E and prM proteins, which, during maturation undergo furin cleavage to leave the c\u2010terminal M transmembrane domain associated with the virus particle. Numerous studies have attempted to characterize neutralizing epitopes on DENV structural proteins, with serotype\u2010specific MAbs against DENV E protein reportedly having enhanced neutralizing activity 130. Indeed, potential therapeutic antibodies that recognize epitopes on domain III (DIII) of the E protein have shown neutralizing activity, not only in DENV infections but also in other flaviviruses and across heterologous DENV genotypes 130, 131, 132. DIII\u2010specific antibodies, however, are only part of a larger antibody repertoire and whether these antibodies contribute to DENV neutralization in vivo remains a contentious issue, only complicated by ADE. Recent studies have confirmed that highly cross\u2010reactive antibodies with both neutralizing and enhancing activity dominate the human immune response to DENV infection 133.",

Specific depletion of cross\u2010reactive E\u2010binding antibodies, antibodies that predominantly recognize the fusion loop region in E DII, only partially decreased the enhancement capacity of the immune sera against heterotypic serotypes, indicating that additional structural protein antibodies play a role in ADE of heterotypic DENV infections.

Recent advances in human hybridoma technology have confirmed the enhancing effect of human anti\u2010DENV MAbs, which in the past had largely been observed with mouse MAbs 136. These advances have allowed a better understanding of the humoral immune response to dengue virus infection in humans. Interestingly, human hybridomas could be derived from the cells of subjects infected with DENV 20 years or more prior to collection of peripheral blood. These long\u2010term memory B cells that predominated in the circulation were found to encode enhancing antibodies, creating the potential for ADE of DENV infection, and thus disease enhancement, for decades after the initial infection. Anti\u2010prM antibodies have been shown to be a major component of the human serological response to DENV infection. However, most of these antibodies exhibited limited virus neutralization capacity and were highly cross\u2010reactive among the dengue virus serotypes 135. Even at high concentrations, anti\u2010prM was unable to fully neutralize DENV infection but potently promoted ADE in FcR\u2010bearing cells. The inefficient cleavage of prM to M during DENV processing results in relatively high levels of immature, prM\u2010containing virus particles released from infected cells. It is therefore likely that ADE of immature, normally non\u2010infectious DENV particles by anti\u2010prM antibodies facilitates efficient virus binding and cell entry into Fc receptor\u2010expressing cells 137. Concurrently, the partial cleavage of prM in DENV exudates may reduce the density of antigen available for viral neutralization by anti\u2010prM antibodies. Thus, anti\u2010prM antibodies may enable infection by the otherwise inactive immature by\u2010products of infected cells via ADE of infection, an interesting proposition, given also that prM antibody responses were shown to be significantly higher in patients with secondary DENV infection than primary infection 138. It is possible that anti\u2010prM\u2010mediated ADE of DENV infection contributes to the severe disease pathologies associated with secondary infection. It has been suggested that in promoting an anti\u2010prM antibody response, DENV benefits not only from immune enhancement but also as an immune evasion strategy. In addition to restoring the infectivity of non\u2010infectious immature DENV, prM\u2010specific antibodies have also been found to cross\u2010react with a cryptic epitope on the E protein located to the DI/DII junction 139. Despite being unavailable on a native, functionally folded E protein, this cryptic epitope may impede E protein or E protein subunit\u2010based immunization strategies; such approaches may be unable to completely avoid generation of anti\u2010prM antibodies that enhance DENV infection.",

In agreement with previous observations that ADE occurs in the presence of sub\u2010neutralizing quantities of antibody, analyses of neutralization and Fc\u03b3R\u2010dependent ADE suggest that these two phenomena are related by differences in the number of antibodies bound to a single virion 45.

The neutralization threshold governs the upper limit, while the minimum number of antibodies required for ADE was found to be approximately half the number required for neutralization. The functional activity of MAbs was further determined by the location of the epitope, the antibody affinity, and epitope accessibility.

In the mouse model, infection with serotype cross\u2010reactive, antibody\u2010opsonized DENV in AG129 mice, which lack type 1 and II interferon (IFN) receptors, also displayed a significantly higher mortality, albeit with a lower peak serum viremia than after direct virus inoculation 155.

Pathogen opsonization results in the formation of IgG complexes that can activate low\u2010affinity receptors. This leads to virus neutralization and/or phagocytosis/internalization. An investigation of 66 DENV patients and 37 healthy individuals showed that there was no correlation between serum Fc\u03b3RI and severity of disease in DENV patients, despite increased levels in patients with and without vascular leakage compared to healthy subjects 166.

Although RIG\u2010I and MDA\u20105 recognize different ligands, they share common signaling features with the TLR\u2010dependent pathway.

Several possibilities may explain this intrinsic ADE. Firstly, ADE may sabotage the TLR\u2010independent antiviral pathway by downregulating RIG\u2010I and MDA5 expression and promoting dihydroxyacetone kinase (DAK) and autophagy\u2010related 5/12 protein (Atg5/12) production (Fig. \n2\nA).

Secondly, ligation of Fc\u03b3R\u2010immunocomplex can modulate cytokine production.

Although data for Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated cytokine responses in the context of DENV ADE are variable 200, 201, increased TNF and IL\u20106 production has consistently been shown in monocytes, macrophages, and DCs upon exposure to immunocomplexes 161. Differences between studies may be attributed to antibody differences. Certainly, virus\u2010specific memory B cell\u2010derived MAb isolated using recombinant antigen may exclude some potentially neutralizing antibodies that do not bind to conformational epitopes in vitro.

A study using DENV ADE in THP\u20101 cells showed an inverse relationship between the expression of TLR3, 4, and 7 expression and that of sterile\u2010alpha and Armadillo motif\u2010containing protein (SARM) and TANK 177. Upregulation of SARM and TANK led to downregulation of TLR signaling molecules, most significantly those using NF\u2010\u03baB signaling (Fig. \n2\nA). Although TANK has been implicated in positive regulation of IRF3, as well as NF\u2010\u03baB, it was recently shown to negatively regulate the activity of TLR signaling by directly binding to TRAF6, inhibiting TRAF6 ubiquitylation, and leading to the inhibition of NF\u2010\u03baB activity 179, 208, 209.

            "text": "Of note, Syk activation through Fc\u03b3RIIa signaling cascades appears to be tightly regulated to prevent exaggerated inflammatory responses to the few immune complexes containing harmless antigens that may be present in the circulation at any time. Regulation is accomplished by the balance between activating ITAM and inhibitory ITIM signaling. Indeed, absence of inhibitory ITIM signaling is associated with autoimmune disease 225, 226, 227. Both the inhibitory and activating signals via immunoreceptor pathways involve activation of Src family kinases following the engagement of Fc\u03b3R by immunocomplex. However, the activating signals utilize the activation of Src for activating Syk, while the activation of Src in the inhibitory signaling pathway leads to recruitment of either inositol phosphatase SHIP (Src homology 2\u2010containing inositol polyphosphate 5\u2010phosphatase) or the tyrosine phosphatase SHP\u20101 (Src homology 2\u2010containing protein tyrosine phosphatase\u20101), which subsequently dampens downstream signaling responses by dephosphorylating Syk 228. In this context, DENV\u2010immunocomplexes may exploit inhibitory ITIM signaling to subvert the expression of ISG. As mentioned previously, Fc\u03b3RIIb is one of most common ITIM\u2010containing transmembrane proteins on myeloid cells. However, DENV\u2010immunocomplex failed to bind to Fc\u03b3RIIb at sub\u2010neutralizing levels of antibody to establish ADE 229. Additionally, ligation of DENV\u2010immunocomplex by Fc\u03b3RIIb was only achieved at high concentrations of antibody and did not induce ADE 162, 229. A recent study, which exploited differences in inducing ADE between subclones of THP\u20101 cells, found that the binding of leukocyte immunoglobulin\u2010like receptor\u2010B1 (LILRB1) to the DENV virion may inhibit the activation of Syk and abrogate the expression of ISG 230 (Fig. \n2\nB). LILRB1 is an ITIM\u2010containing transmembrane protein, expressed on T cells, NK cells, and B cells but primarily on myeloid cells 231. The inhibitory effect of LILRB1 has also been shown in the monocytic lineage in various diseases 232, 233, 234, 235. Following receptor engagement, Src family protein tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the tyrosine residue on the ITIM, which recruits either inositol phosphatase SHIP or SHP\u20101. At this stage, SHP\u20101 is activated by phosphorylation, then dephosphorylates and inactivates Syk 227, 230. Thus, ligation of DENV\u2010immunocomplexes by Fc\u03b3RIIa and the binding of LILRB1 to the DENV virion can synergistically induce intrinsic ADE in THP\u20101 cells. On the surface of it, these pathways controlled by Syk appear to be in conflict. Thus, it is not clear whether the inhibition of Syk by LILRB\u20101 may lead to a reduction in IL\u201010 production under ADE conditions, but this may involve a temporal balance of inhibition and activation of Syk yet to be elucidated. If so, based on data from patients with severe DENV infection 197, 199, this balance is presumably tuned in favor of excessive IL\u201010 production.",

The potential of IVIG infusion in ameliorating WNV encephalitis has been reported both experimentally and clinically. In the earliest studies conducted by Engle and Diamond, passive transfer of serum from mice that survived primary WNV infection into WT mice prevented morbidity and mortality in subsequent WNV infection. Although passive transfer of the immune sera failed to prevent mortality in immune\u2010compromised B cell\u2010deficient (\u03bcMT) mice, these mice survived for a longer period of time (range between 30 and 50 days) post infection, compared to the typical 10\u2010day survival in control mice 243. Subsequent work in a murine model of lethal WNV encephalitis demonstrated an increased survival rate following IVIG administration, particularly with IVIG derived from donors from a WNV endemic region \u2013 Israel \u2013 which are likely to contain anti\u2010WNV antibodies 244. Indeed, the presence of anti\u2010WNV antibodies in IVIG preparations collected from US donors protected mice from lethal dose of WNV 245. Recently, Srivastava et al. 246 shed insight into the mechanism underlying IVIG efficacy in animal models, identifying that IVIG preparations containing antibodies against WNV are capable of dampening inflammatory monocyte (Ly6chigh CD11b+) infiltration into the central nervous system, hence limiting the extent of inflammation and prolonging survival in a WNV mouse model. Consistent with this, recent studies by Getts et al. 247 demonstrated that therapeutic modulation of inflammatory monocyte immigration into the CNS using immune\u2010modifying microparticles significantly increased survival in a WNV mouse model. In addition to the success of IVIG treatment observed in animal studies, growing evidence pinpointing the therapeutic potential of IVIG has been reported in the clinical context. Infusion of IVIG preparations containing high titers of anti\u2010WNV antibodies prevented the development of neuroinvasive WNV disease in a patient who contracted WNV infection through a liver transplant obtained from an infected individual 248. The rapid efficacy of passive immunoprophylaxis with IVIG was further evidenced in a clinical study performed by Shimoni et al. 249, in which 12 WNV patients exhibiting neuroinvasive signs were given IVIG administration. Although 25% of this cohort died of neurological complications, 75% either partially or completely recovered, with 4 out of the 12 patients experiencing a rapid improvement in clinical condition as early as 48 h post IVIG treatment, suggesting a potential for IVIG infusion to treat lethal cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease.",

Severe forms of DENV infection give rise to potentially lethal severe thrombocytopenia and shock syndrome 250. IVIG is widely used as treatment for immunothrombocytopenia and gives positive medical outcomes 251, 252. During the DHF outbreak in Brazil in 2002, five clinically diagnosed DHF patients were given high doses of IVIG. The rapid reduction in bleeding diathesis and immediate recovery of platelet count in these patients suggested IVIG had potential in treating DHF 253. Furthermore, a clinical study, in which intravenous anti\u2010D (Rh0D IgG) immune globulin was administered in children and adult patient cohorts with secondary DENV infection resulted in increased platelet counts in the children that had exhibited severe thrombocytopenic purpura 254. However, a randomized, controlled clinical study reported opposite results. In 31 patients with acute secondary DENV infection, randomized into high\u2010dose IVIG\u2010treated and untreated groups, despite early administration of IVIG, neither improvement of thrombocytopenia nor adverse side effects were observed 255. Moreover, recently, an animal study in an immunocompetent mouse model of secondary DENV infection demonstrated that increased mortality, exacerbated disease severity, and elevated virus replication were observed in IVIG\u2010treated mice in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Further examination revealed sub\u2010neutralizing titers of anti\u2010DENV antibodies recovered from serum of IVIG\u2010treated mice as a contributing factor to the deleterious outcome 256. Further experimental and clinical studies are warranted to examine the exact effects of IVIG on DENV infections, and the possible adverse effects of IVIG on DENV ADE infections.",

The recent CHIKV outbreaks in the Americas have, as of 15 July 2015, led to 1 118 763 suspected and 24 682 confirmed autochthonous transmission cases of infection, with 192 deaths reported, mainly in Latin America and the Caribbean region 262. Despite a typical 1 in 1000 low fatality ratio associated with CHIKV infection 263, a substantial increase in mortality was reported during the 2005\u20132006 Indian Ocean CHIKV outbreak. To date, the exact cause underlying the increase in mortality is unclear; however, medical complications such as fulminant hepatitis and neurological and cardiological manifestations have been associated with CHIKV\u2010induced fatalities. Previously, a clinical case study reported the outcome in a CHIKV patient who was given high\u2010dose IVIG treatment after being diagnosed with neurological complications. The 44\u2010year\u2010old patient exhibited febrile illness and polyarthralgia during the acute phase of infection, which rapidly subsided within 2 weeks post disease onset. However, during the convalescent phase of infection, neurological complications that led to quadriparesis and myeloneuropathy were observed. A subsequent 4\u2010day infusion of high\u2010dose IVIG rapidly ameliorated the complications and led to a complete recovery at the follow\u2010up after 6 months 264. This clinical case study is consistent with an earlier study by Lebrun et al. 265, which reported rapid recovery after IVIG treatment on two CHIKV patients with late\u2010onset neuropathy \u2013 Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Surprisingly, IVIG treatment of CHIKV patients during early onset of neurological manifestations led to exacerbated disease 266, suggesting that the stage of infection and clinical manifestations exhibited should be carefully assessed prior to IVIG infusion to avoid harmful side effects from treatment. Other precautionary measures such as determining the level of acute phase innate immune protein pentraxin 3 (PTX3) in IVIG plasma preparation as well as patients\u2019 blood specimens should also be taken into consideration 267. PTX3 is highly expressed during a panel of inflammatory diseases and disorders 268. Recently, elevated expression of PTX3 was reported in acute RRV and CHIKV patients, and subsequent experimental study characterized the pathogenic consequences of overt PTX3 expression in enhancing alphavirus replication and causing early disease onset and prolonged disease manifestation 269. Therefore, as a preventive measure for exacerbated disease, IVIG preparations with high level of PTX3 protein should not be given to CHIKV/RRV patients. In addition, high levels of PTX3 expression in patients with Kawasaki disease have been associated with unresponsiveness to IVIG treatment 270. Hence, IVIG treatment in acute RRV/CHIKV patients should also be avoided due to high levels of alphavirus\u2010induced PTX3 expression during the early phase of infection. With these precautionary measures in mind, studies which look into the effects of administering IVIG containing low levels of PTX3 during the convalescence phase of infection might provide new insights into the efficacy of IVIG treatment during alphavirus disease manifestation.",

ADE of viral infection occurs when pre\u2010existing virus\u2010specific antibodies aid uptake of virus into cells bearing Fc receptors, drive complement\u2010dependent infection enhancement, or promote virus particle production early in infection. Whether FcR\u2010dependent ADE of infection plays a role in viral infectivity depends on a number of factors, including infecting virus strain, antibody concentration, and epitope availability. Findings to date partly explain the interaction between intracellular antiviral suppression and the extrinsic role of enhancing antibodies on viral uptake to produce the ADE phenomenon observed for several viruses, and in particular in DHF/DSS patients. Although much of our understanding is based on DENV studies, evidence of ADE of other viruses suggests this phenomenon is widely generalizable.",

Immune complexes are ligated by both activating and inhibitory Fc\u03b3R, and once binding occurs, the cytoplasmic ITAM or ITIM domains deliver the immunocomplex via a phagocytic or recycling pathway, respectively, into the cell. Immunocomplex internalized via the phagocytic Fc\u03b3RIIa pathway is uncoated within the endosome, where viral RNA is recognized by TLRs. Fc\u03b3Rs synergize with TLRs to orchestrate the induction of cytokines. However, paradoxically, DENV seems also to exploit the inhibitory ITIM signaling pathway via LILRB\u20101 and SHP\u20101 to inhibit Syk and thus the expression of ISG, which is otherwise promoted by Syk activation following ligation of Fc\u03b3RIIa with the DENV\u2010immunocomplex. Thus, interactions between Fc\u03b3RIIa and LILRB1 with the DENV\u2010immunocomplex and the DENV virion, respectively, synergistically shift the immune system from an antiviral to immunosuppressive state. Thus, although still poorly defined, the outcome of ADE is evidently a balance between the activating and inhibitory elements of these pathways. Although our understanding of virus ADE has increased substantially over the last decade, important questions remain. The disparities between studies highlight the difficulty of interpreting responses in different cell types infected with different DENV strains and this will likely apply to other viruses also. It will be of significant interest to identify the factor(s) that contribute to the balance between activation and inhibition of Syk in regulating antiviral ISGs versus anti\u2010inflammatory and potentially immunosuppressive IL\u201010. Whether ADE\u2010associated IL\u20106 production is also controlled by Syk activation and to what extent IL\u20106 and IL\u201010 induction pathways are common or separate, will be of interest. There is undoubtedly a need to find an acceptable in vivo model to confirm these findings, as much of the elucidation of ADE mechanisms has come from in vitro studies using monocytic lines or primary human myeloid cells. The lack of an analogous murine equivalent of the Fc\u03b3RIIa or LILR\u2010B1 will make these investigations more difficult.",
