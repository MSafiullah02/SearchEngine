Disordered consciousness after ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke can result from damage to many different structures, including bilateral cerebral cortical injury, pontine tegmentum, midbrain, basal forebrain, hypothalamus and central thalamus, putamen, caudate, and pallidum [9] .

Although amantadine is commonly administered to patients with disorders of consciousness, its mechanism of action remains unclear. It may modulate dopamine activity by increasing its release, blocking its reuptake, and increasing postsynaptic dopamine receptors or altering their conformation and may also antagonize n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [10, 11] . The mechanism of action of modafinil has been attributed to stimulation of alpha 1B noradrenergic receptors, reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, increased glutamate or histamine release, or altered hypocretin activity [12] . Modafinil's effects appear independent of serotonin, dopamine, GABA, adenosine, histamine-3, melatonin, and benzodiazepine receptors. Compared to conventional neurostimulants, modafinil appears to be devoid of dopaminergic effects, which may be of significance as post-stroke dopaminergic system dysfunction has been recently described [12, 13] .",

The 72-h window was chosen based on our anecdotal observation that patients generally respond within acute rehabilitation compared to non-responders (90% vs 62%, p = 0.006). Among survivors, 63/72 (88%) were prescribed a neurostimulant at hospital discharge. The most common potential adverse drug effect was sleep disruption (16%).

Future controlled studies with a neurostimulant administration protocol, prospective evaluation, and discretely defined response and safety criteria are needed to confirm these encouraging findings.",

Accordingly, we adapted the approach used by studies evaluating acute administration of amantadine to TBI patients [15, 20] . Acute stroke patients were characterized as responders if they met two of the following three criteria on any one calendar day within 9 days after neurostimulant initiation: increase in GCS score \u2265 3 points from pre-treatment baseline, clinical improvement in wakefulness or responsiveness documented in caregiver notes, or clinical improvement in wakefulness or responsiveness documented in physical or occupational therapy notes. Caregiver notes and GCS scores were assessed by a neurocritical care Physician Assistant (AML), and physical and occupational therapy notes were assessed by a Doctor of Physical Therapy (KN) and a registered, licensed Occupational Therapist (JC). Supplement 1 describes the approach used by these chart reviewers. Patients who did not meet the definition for responsiveness were classified as non-responders. If patients had an additional neurostimulant added or substituted, the timing of this change was considered when interpreting which drug the patient responded to or did not respond to. Since there was no published literature to establish an expected duration of treatment prior to a response, if a patient responded after at least 24 h of a new combination, we considered them a responder to the new regimen.",

New seizures were defined as treatment (not prophylaxis) with an antiepileptic drug and/or electroencephalographic seizures beginning after neurostimulant initiation.

Delayed cerebral ischemia was present if focal neurological deterioration requiring fluid bolus, vasopressors, or intraarterial vasodilators occurred. Craniotomy for hematoma evacuation was identified by reviewing neurosurgical procedure notes. Mechanical ventilation was identified by reviewing respiratory flow sheets and required an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy with use of a ventilator.

Sleep disruption was present if the patient received a new sleep medication after starting a neurostimulant, and for the other adverse events, the medical record was reviewed for the 48 h prior to initiating neurostimulant therapy, and if the adverse event was not described prior to initiation but was identified afterward, we considered it possibly drug related. Measurements of QTc were obtained from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and were considered prolonged if > 450 ms after an initial ECG with a normal QTc. Agitation and delirium were assessed using a previously published algorithm [24] . The probability that an adverse reaction was related to neurostimulant administration was not assessed using grading scales (e.g., Naranjo scale or Bradford Hill criteria) because of the numerous confounders present in ICU patients, and the lack of demonstrated validity and reliability in critically ill patients.

The common sequelae of stroke (e.g., pain, seizures, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, and intracranial hypertension) also complicated our neurostimulant response assessments. For example, hydrocephalus (which required CSF diversion 97% of the time) may have induced somnolence, while CSF diversion or unclamping external drains may have induced wakening. Similarly, intubated patients who are liberated from mechanical ventilation may become more interactive as their communication improves and sedation is reduced.

Reliance on caregiver notes was an additional limitation but prompted us to incorporate more consistent documentation regarding neurostimulant administration and response. It was not possible to control for changes in the quality of caregiver and PT/OT documentation over time as neurostimulants were more frequently administered.

Given the lack of an untreated control group in this retrospective study, we cannot be certain that any improvements resulted from the medications and it is possible they reflect the natural phase of recovery over time after stroke.

Ideally, a consistent follow-up period would have been maintained for all patients. Similarly, after a change in neurostimulant, a response within the first few days could be from the new regimen or a delayed response from the initial treatment.

Such an analysis may be important as previous studies have suggested stroke location may play a role in neurostimulant responsiveness [36] . Due to small numbers, we did not include patients who received other neurostimulants, such as dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate. Prior data have been published for these agents [37, 38] , and amantadine and modafinil were the two most prescribed stimulants in a recent acute TBI study [21] . Continuing medications started in the ICU at the time of hospital discharge may be inappropriate in some settings [39] , but in the case of neurostimulants, declines were seen when medication was stopped after 4 weeks in TBI patients [14] , suggesting continuation may be appropriate.",

Those who responded were more frequently discharged home or to acute rehabilitation, but we can neither confirm these improvements were medication related, nor that these outcomes are generalizable to other settings. These results are encouraging but must be considered hypothesis-generating given the uncontrolled nature of the study, and the many potential biases and confounders. Further study using standard dosing and escalation strategies, prospective assessment of response and drug safety, and appropriate controls is needed.",
