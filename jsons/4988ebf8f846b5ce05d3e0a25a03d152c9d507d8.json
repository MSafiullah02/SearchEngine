            "text": "In the case of a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, access to large quantities of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) has presented a significant problem. A shortage of face masks and respirators has been widely reported across the world. A concerted effort to manufacture high volumes has not unsurprisingly put pressure on the supply chain and the important certification processes. PPE procured or donated as uncertified stock requires rigorous, expedient and scientifically informed evidence before decisions can be made regarding suitable deployment, expensive certification, return or possible destruction of stock. This paper reports a series of experiments devised in reaction to this situation. In this study, an experimental methodology for the assessment of the filtration performance of samples of real-world, uncertified, fluid resistant surgical masks (FRSM type IIR) was evaluated in the resource limited (lockdown) environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A steadystate flow rig was adapted to incorporate a bespoke filter flow chamber for mounting face masks in order to evaluate the resistance to air flow as an indicator of mask inhalation performance. Pure air was drawn through a specified control surface area at known flow rate conditions; the resistance to the air flow through the masks was measured as the resulting pressure drop. Over 60 tests were performed from 4 different, randomly sampled batches and compared to a control sample of EN Type IIR certified FRSM masks. Steady-state volumetric airflow rates of 30 and 95 lmin -1 were chosen to represent deep breathing and vigorous exercise conditions respectively. The results showed that the sample masks produced a pressure drop of between 26% to 58% compared to the control batch at the lower flow rate and 22% to 55% at the higher rate. The results for each sample were consistent across both flow rates.",

A shortage in supplies has particularly affected health workers who are at most risk of infection (Soucheray, 2020) . The short fall has led to a rapid increase in the production of face masks motivated by the need for public and health care authorities to acquire hitherto unprecedented numbers of masks, from varying sources, to meet the acute demand. However, operational restrictions placed upon the supply chain have meant that many of these face masks are without certification. Authorities can be left with vast quantities that have to be either used as uncertified (putting health workers at risk) or put through a lengthy certification process, thereby delaying the deployment of the masks and incurring additional certification expenses. In the worst cases, masks may need to be returned (and potentially not refunded) or destroyed, thus incurring costs and without addressing the shortage. Several National and International certification protocols exist for masks and respirators (see Table 1 ). The processes involved in certification and approval can be lengthy and costly (CDC, 2018) either for the .

            "text": "The shortage of masks that resulted as a consequence of previous epidemics has focused attention upon the testing of the filtration efficiency of home-made or uncertified masks and respirators made from different materials (Cooper et al. 1983; Rengasamy et al. 2010; Jung et al. 2013; Konda et al. 2020) . Likewise, the re-use performance of the masks or respirators after some form of cleaning or sterilization (Viscusi et al. 2009; Liao et al. 2020 ) and alternative qualitative mask fit testing methods (Provenzano et al. 2020 ) have been studied. However, very little consideration has been given to devising rapid, scalable emergency protocols to help assess the performance of replacement, alternative masks or respirators, during the critical initial stages or beyond, in situations where emergency-use authorisation has been given due to the scarcity of supply. In a recent study, Mueller and Fernandez, (2020) propose a rapid screening tool to evaluate the filtration efficiency of masks when subjected to airborne particulates, similar in size to viruses. Approximately 2 hours of testing was required per mask, thereby limiting its suitability to an emergency rapid response type situation. This paper describes a method that was developed to rapidly assess the inhalation filtration performance of nose and mouth coverings (suitable for both medical face masks and respirators) in response to a public health emergency in a low resource and restricted (lockdown) scenario during the COVID-19 pandemic. It should be clear here that the tests were not devised as a means of certification; instead, a comparative measure of the performance of the masks against an approved Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalization (CEN) EN certified benchmark. An important balance was sought between accuracy of results and test duration given the time constraints imposed by the pandemic emergency call.",

Air entering through the bottom of the chamber is deflected upwards, in a forward tumbling motion, by a small step, designed to promote homogenous mixing in the chamber for tests incorporating water injection (a hole in the bottom of the chamber was provided for insertion of a nebuliser chamber). The mounting plates were designed to clamp the masks flat and accurately in place and facilitate exchanges. The plates were held tightly in place using four coach bolts. A reference flow orifice area was chosen for the tests as shown in Figure 2 for the FRSM Type IIR masks. This was cut into the mounting plates as a template. A firm, impermeable, foam gasket with a thickness of 1 cm was adapted to accommodate the shape of the hard nose ridge piece (within blue strip) in order to eliminate potential flow leakage. The mounting plate design incorporated plates for both flat (FRSM) and conical (N95) shaped masks/respirators. A series of screws on the side of the chamber were used to locate the ear loops. The pressure difference between the atmospheric, ambient conditions in the flow chamber and a pressure tapping downstream of the masks was recorded in mm of H 2 0 using a spirit levelled, liquid paraffin, inclined manometer with a scaling factor of 0.2.

It is not generally necessary to correct for ambient humidity within the flow rate ranges used. The meter is capable of measurements up to 25 ls -1 with an accuracy of +/-0.05 ls -1 . The pressure drop across the meter was measured using a KIMO type CP304 piezoresistive, differential pressure transducer (+/-0.5 % reading or +/-10 Pa). Temperature at the VFAM was measured using a type K thermocouple (+/-1 \u00b0C). Under pandemic lockdown conditions it was not possible to re-calibrate the flow meter prior to testing. Instead, the linearity of the device was evaluated by comparing the previous calibration data (supplied by Young Calibration Limited, UK) against data obtained at the same flow rates, alternately using the differential pressure transducer and an inclined liquid manometer to record the pressure. The results confirmed that both pressures were equal. This concluded that the volumetric flow rates were consistent with the calibrated values, given that the VFAM element was clean and the device does not have any moving or electronic components subject to drift. A linear extrapolation of the calibration data, based upon the assumptions that the calibration curve passes through the origin and that the flow remains laminar throughout the range of tests, was used to determine the pressure drop required to ensure the correct flow breathing flow rates for testing. Repeatability in the test results also confirmed the reliability of the test equipment for comparative purposes.",

Sixteen tests at the two flow rates were conducted using four masks. The same tests were repeated at the end of testing of all the sample masks and showed the results were reproducible. A fixed mass flow rate approach, opposed to a fixed pressure drop method, was adopted. The following simple methodology was devised: 1. A mask was attached to the mounting plate and clamped in position in the flow chamber. 2. All instruments were zeroed. 3. Motive compressed air was regulated to 4 bar and the eductor orifice varied until the required pressure drop was noted on the KIMO differential pressure display at the VFAM (indicating the desired volume flow rate). 4. The display was left to stablise over a period of approximately 30 seconds. (The test rig instruments proved steady and repeatable). 5. The pressure drop across the masks was then read off the scale on the inclined manometer. 6. The higher flow rate was selected using the eductor and the measurements repeated. 7. The lower and higher flow rates were then selected again, and the results recorded once more. 8.

The mean pressure drop for all the tests for each group of masks was calculated for each flow rate condition. The pandemic conditions limited the time available to conduct the tests and therefore the sample size. However, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CoV) in the datasets were evaluated as an indicative result of test repeatability. For the pressure drop measurements, the standard deviation varied between 1 to 6.5 Pa for the 'deep breathing' conditions and 6 to 21 Pa for the 'vigorous effort' conditions, The CoV values ranged between approximately 5 % to 12% for the low flow rate case and between 6 % and 12 % for the higher flow rate. These results are to be expected given the experimental uncertainty in setting the required flow rate at the lower rate could be of the order of 10%. Samples A and B consistently showed the highest values at both flow rates. Sample C exhibited the lowest CoV combined over both flow rates. All the samples were then ranked against the CEN EN certified FRSM Type IIR mask in terms of their inhalation resistance as estimated by pressure drop. The results for the mean pressure drop values, at the two different flow rates, for all the samples tested, are presented in Figure 3 below with +/-1 standard deviation in pressure drop included for reference. .

The results as a percentage normalised to the maximum pressure drop observed for the certified control set are shown in Tables 3a, b. From Figure 3 and Tables 3a, b, it is clear that the control Type IIR mask consistently outperformed the other masks in terms of pressure resistance to flow for both conditions. Samples from each batch of masks performed consistently at each of the test conditions; mask A ranked at 33% (at 30 lmin -1 ) and 31% (at 95 lmin -1 ) of the values of the control mask; mask B ranked at 49% (at 30 lmin -1 ) and 48% (at 95 lmin -1 ) of the values of the control mask; mask C, likewise, 58% (at 30 lmin -1 ) and 55% (at 95 lmin -1 ) of the values of the control mask; mask D ranked lowest at 26% (at 30 lmin -1 ) and 22% (at 95 lmin -1 ) of the values of the control mask. Therefore, the consistent ranking for both high and low flow rates indicated good robustness in the experimental approach. It is interesting to note that one mask in the control sample was used up to 8 times in a series of separate tests (including during setup tests) and started to demonstrate a consistently lower pressure drop of around 10% compared with its first use. It was noted that this could be due to the clamping force placed upon the mask eventually distorting the pleats, thereby exposing more surface area.",

The resistance to the air flow through the device is measured as the pressure drop across a specified portion of the mask. This approach mimics air inhalation through the mask. A sample of certified Type IIR FRSM surgical masks were used as the control reference for the evaluation of the performance of 4 different, randomly selected batches of uncertified but physically similar types of medical masks. The results showed that all the masks tested produced pressure drop values in the range of 22% to 58% of the control set and that their performance was consistently observed at all test conditions. Within the group of masks tested, two sets (between 48% and 58% of the reference set) showed the potential to be professionally assessed for appropriate deployment in a suitable setting.

Overcoming some of the observed limitations, as mentioned previously, such as flat clamp testing, rapid mask exchanging and introducing transient (pulsing) flow rates will be reviewed. In addition, further development of the method for clogging, as discussed briefly above, extended to polydisperse droplet particle size distributions, is also currently being considered.",
