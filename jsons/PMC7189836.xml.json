Immunoassays are more prone to interferences than any other assay, which leads to\nfalse-positive or false-negative results. In most cases, interferences are due to\nthe presence of agents with structural similarities to the reagents (Miller, 2004), and fluctuate according to\nthe concentration of the interfering substance and the analyte. Endogenous\nantibodies (autoantibodies, hetero-antibodies or human anti-animal antibodies) are\ncommonly the main culprit in these interferences (Emerson and Lai, 2013). Their binding to capture antibodies\nand detection antibodies in the absence of antigen (analyte) mainly leads to\nfalse-positive result (Berth and Willaert,\n2016).Accurate QC guarantees reliable results and assumes that the assay is performed\nwell. Therefore, poor QC measures lead to low accuracy and precision. In\nimmunoassays, QC is assured by regular calibration and control of the reagents,\nusing standardized solutions delivered by the manufacturers.The high cost of reagents and equipment is another drawback in immunoassays,\nparticularly for resource-limited settings, considering that the most accurate and\nsensitive methods are automated.",
