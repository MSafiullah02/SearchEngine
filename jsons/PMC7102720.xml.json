            "text": "Approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses [1, 2]. The rate of emergence of zoonotic viruses appears to be increasing and/or our ability to detect new viruses is improving. Viruses are well adapted to their reservoir hosts and therefore exhibit stability within their host's cellular and ecological environments and display little or no clinical disease in these species. However, when a virus jumps the species barrier and spills over into humans, the effects can be devastating. Only when these viruses from wildlife spillover to humans or their domesticated animals and cause mortalities, does this become a significant concern for public health. High mortality rates often characterize these spillover events as do high economic losses. This is particularly true for the bat borne viruses that have emerged in the last 20 years such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Nipah virus (NiV) Hendra virus (HeV) and Ebola virus (EBOV). International travel has contributed to the transmission of many infectious diseases and the bat borne zoonotic viruses are no exception with the most notable being the transmission of SARS-CoV from the key port in Hong Kong to Canada, the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australasia resulting in 8422 cases with 916 deaths (10.9% case fatality) [3].",

They are among the most ancient of mammals, their extensive speciation occurred before development of most modern mammals, and they are the only mammals capable of powered flight. Bats in general are also very long-lived and more widely dispersed globally than other mammals; they play vital roles as pollinators of hundreds of species of plants and trees and in the control of arthropod populations. More recently, resurgence in interest in bat biology and ecology has been sparked by their recognition as the known reservoir hosts of some of the most deadly viral zoonoses [5], to which they appear resistant to any pathogenic effects. Whether bats are unique or special as a reservoir of viruses has been the subject of several recent publications [6, 7] and will not be covered in this review. This review will focus on the ecology, pathogen\u2013host interface and public health considerations of selected bat zoonotic viruses.",

Of particular significance was the co-infection of the pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus type 2. Serological studies identified six people that had seroconverted to Ebola Reston virus, all of which has contact with sick pigs [37]. Importantly, experimental infection with Ebola Reston virus found that the disease was asymptomatic in pigs despite shedding, indicating a risk for farm and abattoir workers [38]. Antibodies to Ebola Reston virus were detected in Rousettus amplexicaudatus bats implicating this bat as a potential reservoir host [39].",

Extrinsic factors such as environmental and anthropogenic stressors can have an effect on the ecology of disease in bats. Environmental stressors such as climatic events (typhoons/cyclones and droughts) that destroy habitat and food resources have been hypothesized to have an impact on the health of bats [40, 41, 42, 43, 44\u2022]. In addition, human activities are selecting for some species of bats that are synanthrophic, and so are benefiting from living close to humans, thereby increasing their numbers and the risk of transmission of disease to humans [45]. Human activities are artificially increasing animal densities by changing the land use and this is increasing the contact between humans, domesticated animals and bats [46]. In the cases of Hendra virus, Nipah virus and Menangle virus, domesticated animals are the amplifying hosts of these zoonotic viruses [15, 47, 48]. Habitat change such as deforestation force changes in roosting sites and can lead to alterations in the population density and the migratory patterns of bats. These anthropogenic activities may be impacting our ecosystem in such a way that the equilibrium is disturbed and spillover of zoonotic viruses readily occur [49, 50, 51].",

It is believed that the fruiting trees overhanging the intensive pig farms attracted flying foxes, leading to NiV spillover into pigs [52]. It has been hypothesized that the Nipah virus outbreak in pigs was contributed by the El Nino Southern Oscillation induced drought and subsequent forest fires in Indonesia that produced a smoke haze that led to the migration of flying foxes into Malaysia and the subsequent spillover of NiV into pigs [52]. However, this hypothesis was refuted by a later study which suggested that there were multiple introductions of NiV into the piggery. It was thought that repeated introductions of NiV allowed for viral persistence to be established within the pig population which in turn resulted in transmission of NiV to humans [53]. NiV underwent a host shift from fruit bats into pigs that allowed for high levels of virus to be shed and persist within a new host. Management practices of relocating pigs to grower farms further spread the virus. Trade allowed for further NiV transmission with pigs being transported to Singapore for processing increasing the spread of the outbreak [14].",

In the case of EBOV, the transmission has been further exacerbated by the lack of barrier nursing and the use of traditional burial practices where mourners make contact with the deceased [36]. Desire for wild animal meat including bats, and trade in live wet markets have allowed susceptible animals to come into contact with bats enabling the subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV into humans [54, 55]. Once established, person-to-person transmission occurred and the virus was widely spread by international travellers [56]. Importantly, international collaboration allowed for the aetiology of the outbreak to be rapidly determined. This in turn allowed for the development of diagnostic assays for the detection of the virus and greatly assisted in the control of the outbreak [3]. Recently, a novel coronavirus isolated from a Saudi make patient suffering pneumonia and renal failure was determined to be most similar to bat coronaviruses through an international collaboration [57, 58\u2022]. Following the posting on Promed of this case [57], another coronavirus with 99.5% similarity to the virus was identified as the causative agent of a Saudi man from Qatar (and hospitalized in London) suffering from a severe respiratory illness [59]. This allowed the development of real-time molecular assays for the rapid detection of these viruses [60]. More recently, another Saudi man has been diagnosed with a similar coronavirus infection [61].",

The virus\u2013bat interface is impacted by the extrinsic factors mentioned above, as well as viral and host factors (intrinsic factors). There are multiple intrinsic factors of the reservoir host such as age, body condition, reproductive status, sex and social status that are impacted by stress. For instance, stresses due to starvation and the breeding season for males may play an important role in the epidemiology of disease as stress caused by these factors may dampen the immune response making individuals more susceptible to infection [62]. In the case of EBOV, it is thought that starvation leads to fruit bats and primates coming into close proximity during their quest for food, facilitating spillover [63]. Transmission of viruses could also occur following changes in the hierarchy of the colony that lead to fighting for dominance, and during courtship and mating via grooming and biting [7]. Seasonal periods when juveniles have waning maternal antibody and are therefore susceptible to virus infection have been associated with increased transmission of Marburg virus to humans [64\u2022\u2022] and have been thought to have a role in increasing the incidence of transmission within bat colonies for HeV as well as Marburg virus [46, 62, 64\u2022\u2022]. Bats live on average 3.5 times longer than a mammal of similar size [65], hence longevity in bats promotes persistence of viruses in the reservoir host, while the ability to fly allows long-distance dispersal of the infectious agent. Aerosols, direct contact and arthropods could also serve as vectors for transmission within the colony or to other species.",

Many of these highly pathogenic viruses display a broad cell tropism, being able to infect a wide range of cells and hosts (HeV, NiV, EBOV, SARS-CoV) [69, 70, 71, 72].

This involved the development of a recombinant protein-based vaccination program for horses in high-risk areas. The vaccination aims to achieve two purposes: prevent horses from HeV infection and, more importantly, block the horse-to-human transmission. With the recent release of a vaccine against HeV in early November 2012, it will be interesting to see whether this One Health strategy is effective in interrupting the zoonotic transmission cycle of HeV.",

With increased interaction between humans and their domesticated animals and bats, increasing rates of infections will continue to occur. In the past, there has been passive surveillance on dead animals, and it is time to form an international consortium for active surveillance of different bat populations to detect potential zoonotic agents as well as unknown viruses of low pathogenicity that could combine with other viruses to be pathogenic [42]. The use of new technologies such as high throughput sequencing and multiplex serological tests should be an integral part of this effort to increase our ability for pre-emergence monitoring of potential zoonotic pathogens.",

In order to help predict and prevent the emergence of viruses, we need a greater understanding of the infection dynamics within their hosts and to understand the impact of human changes to the environment on the potential for virus spillover. A fully integrated One Health approach with international scientists, ecologists, veterinarians, health professionals, social scientists and politicians working together is required to minimize the impact of bat borne zoonotic diseases. It is critical that we are able to coexist with bats as these unique creatures are vital to our ecosystem.",
