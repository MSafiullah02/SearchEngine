Surprisingly, severity of hypoxemia, lung compliance abnormalities and markers of inflammation in the lung or blood all fail to predict mortality [7\u20139]. Several groups of investigators have demonstrated, however, that elevated markers of lung fibroproliferation predict a poor outcome in patients with ARDS [10\u201313]. For example, both the presence of fibrosis on lung biopsies [14, 15] and elevated levels of procollagen I and procollagen III in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid have been associated with increased risk of death in patients with ARDS [10\u201313]. In addition, the pulmonary dead space fraction, which may be a marker of fibrosis, was shown to predict mortality [16].",

We developed a bioassay that measures the activity of the human procollagen I promoter in primary cultures of normal human lung fibroblasts. We used this assay to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from patients with ARDS within 48 h of intubation could activate procollagen I by transcription. We then measured active transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21), a member of a family of polypeptide growth factors that activates fibroblasts [17], in BALF and also determined whether blocking TGF-\u03b21 could prevent BALF-induced procollagen I promoter activation. Lastly, we wished to determine if either of our biological assays could predict mortality or other important clinical outcomes.

Transient transfections of NHLF were carried out at 50% confluence in 6-well plates using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. A typical transfection was performed by using 2.0 \u00b5g of a firefly luciferase reporter driven by procollagen I promoter (PIP) [19] and 50 ng of Renilla luciferase driven by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (prL-TK vector, Promega). Cells were exposed to 1 ml of FGM-2 media along with either 1 ml of saline (negative control) or 1 ml of BALF from different samples. A positive control was conducted in cells exposed to 1 ml of FGF2-media combined with 1 ml of saline containing recombinant active human TGF-\u03b21 (0.5 ng/ml). Cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase values were obtained using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The ratio of PIP-luciferase/TK-luciferase was calculated for each sample and normalized to maximal activation as assessed by incubation with 0.5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21. Each BAL sample was analyzed three separate times and the average value was used for analysis. To determine whether inhibitors of PIP activation were present in the BALF, PIP activity was measured 24 h after the addition of exogenous active human TGF-\u03b21 (0.5 ng/ml) to each BAL sample. In an available subset of five ARDS samples with the highest PIP activation, a neutralizing antibody for TGF-\u03b21 (10 ng/ml, R&D systems) was added to the samples to determine whether it decreased PIP activation.",

To address this question, we developed a bioassay using the full length human PIP in primary human lung fibroblasts. The use of primary cultured cells minimizes the effect of aberrant signaling mechanisms that may be present in immortalized cells. The use of the full length promoter allows for responses to both stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines that may be present in the BALF. Therefore, this system provides direct evidence for factor(s) in BALF from ARDS patients that can activate the PIP and also for the absence of significant inhibitors of this activation. Our bioassay differs from that used by Fahy et al., who transfected the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter [24] driving luciferase into mink lung epithelial cells. Their assay is very sensitive for detection of active TGF-\u03b21, but cannot address the question of whether TGF-\u03b21 or other cytokines is/are responsible for PIP activation.",

One previous study has shown that higher BAL procollagen I peptide levels were associated with increased mortality risk [12]. These investigators measured procollagen I peptide levels four times within the first week of intubation. While there were no differences in procollagen I levels between survivors and non-survivors in the first 24 h following intubation, there were significant differences by day 7. In contrast, day 1 BAL procollagen III levels have been shown to be predictive of mortality [10, 13] and day 1 tracheal aspirate levels of N-terminal procollagen III peptide levels greater than 1.75 U/ml were associated with a two-fold increased risk of death [11]. Collagen content and the ratio of type I to type III collagen is altered following lung injury [38] and it is possible that the balance of type I and type III collagen may be important in patient outcome. We did not measure BAL PIP activity later in ARDS (e.g. day 3 or day 7) and it may be that inability to downregulate procollagen 1 expression over time may impact outcome.",

BAL TGF-\u03b21 levels inversely correlated with ventilator-free days and with ICU-free days. There is also a suggestion that patients with higher TGF-\u03b21 levels may have a higher risk of death and may die faster, although neither outcome was statistically significant. The failure to reach statistical significance may be due to the relatively small numbers of patients in our study. Based on the unknown operating characteristics of our novel assays, it was difficult to calculate the power of our study a priori.",

Several groups of investigators have reported that markers of alveolar epithelial cell injury predict outcome in patients with ARDS [39\u201341]. TGF-\u03b21 can increase both alveolar epithelial permeability [42, 43] and downregulate alveolar epithelial proliferation [44]. TGF-\u03b21 can also increase pulmonary endothelial permeability by promoting adherens junction disassembly [45] as well as inhibiting pulmonary endothelial proliferation [46]. Thus, the effect of TGF-\u03b21 on alveolar epithelial and endothelial function in ARDS and its relationship to clinical outcome deserves further study.",
