            "text": "Typical methods for assessing hydration in adult animals may be unreliable in neonates [3]. Whereas tenting of the skin is used to detect dehydration in adult animals, skin turgor is less reliable in neonates because of increased water content and decreased fat content of the skin. The thin skin on the ventral abdomen is the best place to evaluate hydration status in neonates. In adult animals, severe dehydration causes tachycardia and concentrated urine. These variables cannot be relied on in neonates because the heart rate normally is rapid and urine is not concentrated in neonates. Mucous membranes often remain moist in neonates until dehydration is severe. Mucous membrane color and capillary refill time are good indicators of perfusion in neonates and adult animals. Neonates normally have hyperemic mucous membranes for the first week of life [4]. Pale mucous membranes and slow capillary refill time (> 1.5 sec) are seen when dehydration is severe enough to cause hypovolemic shock. Puppies with poor perfusion still may have normal skin turgor even when mucous membrane color and capillary refill time indicate shock. Clinical signs of sepis, hypovolemia, or shock in neonates include pale mucous membranes, decreased urine output, cold extremities, limp body tone, constant crying, and reluctance to suckle [5]. The veterinarian should determine whether the animal has simple dehydration or actual perfusion deficits. The sicker the animal, the more aggressive the route chosen for fluid therapy. Neonates with sepsis or severe hypovolemia need rapid and aggressive fluid resuscitation by either the intravenous or intraosseous route [2]. Neonates with mild to moderate dehydration can receive fluids orally (by stomach tube), subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally.",

            "text": "Stomach tube feeding can be used to give fluids and nutrition to neonates that are not hypothermic, hypoglycemic, or dehydrated. It is an effective method of providing hydration and nutrition to neonates that cannot suckle from the dam. A 5- to 8-Fr feeding tube is used to measure from the tip of the nose to the last rib (\nFig. 1). The tube is marked, lubricated, and passed down the left side of the mouth. It should pass easily, but it is important to remember that a gag reflex is not present until approximately 10 days of age [1]. Proper placement can be assured by instilling a small amount of sterile saline first and making sure that it does not come out of the nose. The stomach capacity of the neonate is approximately 50 mL/kg [1], although filling the stomach to capacity is not recommended because the risk of aspiration increases with a full stomach. Commercial milk replacer can be used, and the amount fed can be determined from the label on the can. Initially, puppies can be fed 10 mL every 2 to 4 hours, increasing the amount by 1 mL per feeding. Kittens can be started at 5 mL every 2 to 4 hours, increasing by 1 mL per day. Food should be warmed to approximately 100\u00b0F. If diarrhea occurs, the formula should be diluted 1:2 with balanced electrolyte solution until diarrhea resolves. When removing the stomach tube after feeding, it is important to kink it to prevent aspiration of liquid that otherwise could drain from the tube as it is being pulled out.",

This amount of fluid plus the dehydration deficit (% dehydration \u00d7 body weight in kg = liters of crystalloid fluid) can be divided into several equal portions and administered subcutaneously at the intrascapular space.

The best fluid to correct mild dehydration is a balanced electrolyte solution, such as lactated Ringer's solution or Normosol-R. If dextrose supplementation is desired, 0.45% NaCl with 2.5% dextrose can be administered safely by the subcutaneous route. If hypokalemia is present, up to 30 mEq/L of KCl can be added to fluids for subcutaneous administration.",

Type B cats (usually purebred cats of British breed descent) have naturally occurring anti-A antibodies. The kittens are born normally, but when they begin to nurse, they ingest anti-A antibodies in the colostrum, which results in acute life-threatening hemolysis. Clinical signs develop within hours to days and may include sudden death, fading kittens, tail tip necrosis, hemoglobinuria, icterus, and severe anemia. If possible, neonatal isoerythrolysis should be prevented by blood-typing breeding pairs and not breeding type A males to type B females. If the condition does occur, however, the kittens should be removed from the queen for the first 24 hours as soon as a problem is suspected and managed with supportive care as outlined previously. If anemia is severe and a transfusion is required, washed red blood cells from the queen or other type B cat can be administered at a dose of 5 to 10 mL per kitten administered over several hours. This blood is not lysed by the colostral antibodies. The red cells should be suspended in saline rather than plasma to prevent further administration of anti-A antibodies.
