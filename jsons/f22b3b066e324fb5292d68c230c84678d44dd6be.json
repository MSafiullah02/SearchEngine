China, which had initiated the largest community containment effort in history, has been successful at containing the outbreak, and since mid-February the daily number of new COVID-19 cases has been declining in China. 2 In the Republic of Korea (ROK) with one of the highest number of infections outside China, the outbreak also appears to have stabilized after application of rigorous measures such as strict contact tracing and large-scale quarantine.",

This was in part due to Singapore's strategy of using a comprehensive surveillance system to detect as many cases as possible, and to contain them at the individual level. Despite early importations resulting in local chains of transmission, the rise in the number of cases has been steady without the exponential growth observed elsewhere. This suggests that this strategy, coupled with community-based measures proportionate to the transmission risk, has been effective in containing spread, and could be considered in countries in the early stages of the outbreak where it is not possible to mount massive community-wide containment efforts.",

First, a case definition to identify suspect cases, at healthcare facilities or through contact tracing, was established based on clinical and epidemiological criteria, and evolved over time as more information became available. To identify cases in the community that do not fulfill the case definition, an enhanced surveillance system was set up to detect COVID-19 among all cases of pneumonia in hospital and primary care, severely-ill patients in hospital intensive care units and deaths with possible infectious cause, and influenza-like illness (ILI) in sentinel primary care clinics. Finally, doctors were also allowed to test patients whom they viewed with suspicion for clinical or epidemiological reasons. To support the surveillance system, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR laboratory testing capacity was scaled up rapidly to all public hospitals in Singapore, and is able to handle 2,200 tests a day for a population of 5.7m. Similarly, ROK has also quickly expanded testing capacities, including setting up drive-through testing stations, and has conducted over 200,000 tests to date. 3 All suspected and confirmed cases were immediately isolated in hospital to prevent onward transmission. Contact tracing was also initiated to determine their movement history 14 days prior to symptom onset to isolation to determine possible sources of infection and also to prevent onward transmission among close contacts. Any contact with current or recent symptoms after exposure to the case was referred to hospitals for isolation and testing as part of active case finding. Close contacts who were well were placed under mandatory quarantine for 14 days from their last date of exposure, while other lower-risk contacts were put on phone surveillance.",
