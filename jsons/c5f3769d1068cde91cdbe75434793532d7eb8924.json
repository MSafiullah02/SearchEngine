Local surveillance systems now hold the ability to incorporate real-time data from local, regional, and national databases into decision support tools, but these technologies are rendered inconsequential should resources not be allocated appropriately or in a timely fashion. In the United States, state and federal stockpiles of medical supplies exist can be rapidly distributed, 3 but a pandemic scenario is likely to complicate resource allocation on local and sub-national levels because of competing areas of similar need, limiting the allocation and deployment of these resources. This bottleneck could be ameliorated through technology by decreasing our reliance on human estimation thresholds of when to galvanize action. During emergencies, decisionmakers may be inundated with data and information leading to improvident action, or worse, inaction. Tools and technology that automate the presentation of data to decisionmakers could help by triggering alerts and pushing messages indicating aberrancy to both decision-makers and front-line staff. Theoretically, this technological dashboard with decision support tools would improve outbreak response by leading to the earlier mobilization of resources. This technology also holds the potential to provide front -line staff with diagnostic tools, staffing resources, and supply chain management priorities in scalable, deployable fashions separate from current modeling by providing triggers and notifications in real time when preset warning thresholds are crossed.",

To move the needle of preparedness, NYC H\u00feH System-wide Special Pathogens Program has developed a number of training resources for frontline clinicians both within its health-care delivery system and open to the national audience to maintain competency and readiness during potential outbreak events. This includes (1) a 1-day, 8-h immersive simulation course that offers didactic and hands-on clinical simulation with focus on safety precautions while in personal protective equipment, live donning/doffing technique, and exercise on patient transfer and transport scenarios, including clinical stations for immediate bodily fluid disinfection and clean up and collection of laboratory specimens; (2) using a mobile emergency department, a team of emergency department staff are submerged into a severe respiratory disease outbreak simulation based on the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with increasing patient acuity. Using innovative teaching methods and clinical simulation technology with part-task and hi-fidelity simulators, each team is presented with realistic patient scenarios; (3) ongoing 1-h in-service trainings for frontline clinicians on how to best identify, isolate, implement infection control measures, notify and preliminarily managing highly infectious disease patients; and (4) continue to practice what we preach and test our plans and processes through ongoing drills and exercises varying in scope, scenario and intensity throughout the acute, postacute, and ambulatory service lines. All 4 training offerings and operations-and discussion-based exercises can be on the NYC H\u00feH system's website in the form of templates for other sites to customize and use. We strongly urge other health systems to adopt, customize, and use these resources to ensure all healthcare facilities are given the ongoing opportunity to train and exercise. After all, we are as strong as our weakest link.",
