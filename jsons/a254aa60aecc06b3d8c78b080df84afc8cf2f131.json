SARS typically begins with flu-like symptoms, including high fever (100.4 \u2022 F/38 \u2022 C, or higher) that may be accompanied by headache and muscle aches, cough, and shortness of breath. In some cases, the fever may not appear for up to 10 days. Up to 20% of people infected may develop diarrhea. Most patients with SARS subsequently will develop pneumonia. Between 10% and 20% of SARS patients will become progressively worse and develop breathing problems so severe that they may require the help of a mechanical respirator. SARS is fatal in some cases, often due to respiratory failure. Other possible complications include heart and liver failure.",

The replication of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses is dependent on processing of replicase polyproteins by two cysteine proteases, one of which is the papain-like protease (PLpro). By using bioinformatics analyses of multiple SARS-CoVs, researchers have been able to identify a putative catalytic triad and a zincbinding site (3, 4) . Furthermore, molecular modeling of PLpro suggested deubiquitinating activity. The 1.85\u00c5 crystal structure of the PLpro catalytic core was then elucidated, demonstrating an intact zinc-binding motif, a catalytically competent active site that includes a ubiquitinlike amino terminal domain, as well as overall resemblance to known deubiquitinating enzymes. Sites within the catalytic cleft were well defined and accounted for strict substrate-recognition motifs. The detailed understanding of the SARS-CoV Plpro enzymatically active domain is critical to the development of antiviral drugs and to better understanding of the role of PLpro in the biogenesis of the SARS-CoV replicase complex.",

            "text": "r Human Antibodies That Block Human and Animal SARS Viruses Identified. An international team of investigators has identified the first human antibodies that can neutralize different strains of virus responsible for outbreaks of SARS (5) . The researchers used a mouse model and in vitro assays to test the neutralizing activity of the antibodies. The study is important because the viral strain that caused the outbreak in people in 2002 probably no longer exists in nature, and what is needed is a proof that the antibodies are effective not only against the strain of SARS virus isolated from people but also against a variety of animal strains, because animals will be a likely source for re-emergence of the SARS virus. The investigators' research into the spike glycoprotein-the part of the virus that binds and allows entry into human cells-provided the knowledge needed to identify several human antibodies against the SARS virus. In particular, the researchers identified two human antibodies that bind to a region on the SARS virus' spike glycoprotein, which is called the receptor-binding domain (RBD). One of the antibodies, called S230.15, was found in the blood of a patient who had been infected with SARS and later recovered. The second antibody, m396, was taken from a library of human antibodies the researchers developed from the blood of 10 healthy volunteers. Because humans already have immune cells that express antibodies that are very close to those that can effectively neutralize the SARS virus, m396 could be fished out of healthy volunteers. The investigators next solved the structure of m396 and its complex with the SARS RBD and showed that the antibody binds to the region on the RBD that allows the virus to attach to host cells. If the antibodies were successful in binding to the SARS RBD, they would prevent the virus from attaching to the SARS coronavirus receptor, ACE2, on the outside of human cells, effectively neutralizing it. When tested in cells in the laboratory, both antibodies potently neutralized samples of the virus from both outbreaks. The antibodies also neutralized samples of the virus taken from wild civets (a cat-like mammal in which strains of the virus were found during the outbreaks), although with somewhat lower potency. The discovery of two effective antibodies has the advantage that a newly emergent variation of the SARS coronavirus might be insensitive to neutralization with one, but still susceptible to the other. The results of the study have demonstrated novel, potential antibody-based therapeutics against SARS that could be used alone or in combination (5) .",

To date, the three-dimensional structures of seven open reading frames (ORF) structures have been elucidated, namely (i) ORF 1a/nsp3b (phosphatase); (ii) ORF 1a/nsp5 (3CL-pro); (iii) ORF 1a/nsp7 (with four-helix bundle); (iv) ORF 1a/nsp9 (RNA binding domain); (v) ORF1a/sars7a (unknown function); (vi) ORF 1a/nsp10 (contains zinc finger); and (vii) ORF 1a/nsp3d (PLpro-protease with deubiquitinating activity).
