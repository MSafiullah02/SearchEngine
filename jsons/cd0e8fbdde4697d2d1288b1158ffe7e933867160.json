The host protease TMPRSS2 breaks down SPIKE protein into subunits (S1 and S2) after binding with ACE 2. 1 Eventually, virus fuses with the cell membrane of the host cell and gains entry via endocytosis. 1 Cells of lungs, heart, kidney, intestine and arteries predominantly harbor expression of ACE 2 on their surfaces and thus are the potential sites for virus entry and infectivity. 3 In addition, ACE 2 has been reported to be present at various locations in the oral cavity and hence, oral cavity is considered as a potential site for the COVID 19 virus. 3 ACE 2 is required for maintaining tissue homeostasis and is known for its anti-apoptotic, antiinflammatory, anti-oxidant as well as anti-fibrotic role. 4 These protective effects are caused due to degradation of local Ang II and its product Ang1-7 via ACE2-Ang1-7-Mas pathway. 5 Disruption of this axis is the cause of various pathologies including fibrosis of the organs.",

Numerous singling pathways causing increased collagen fiber deposition and reduced collagen degradation govern the fibrosis. 7 With aforementioned discussion in mind, it is quite conceivable to speculate downregulation of ACE 2 in the oral cavity of OSMF patients. In this regard, ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism has been reported in OSMF tissues. 8 Thus, the less availability of ACE 2 in the oral cavity might have compromised the binding of COVID 19 virus. However, this has to be confirmed with appropriate epidemiological studies. The other way round, if OSMF patient is affected with COVID-19, then it may cause further exhaustion of ACE 2. The exhausted ACE 2 will unable to degrade the Ang II via ACE2-Ang1-7-Mas axis and lead to accentuation of fibrosis in OSMF patients. (Figure 1 )",

Moreover, frontline doctors and healthcare workers are under tremendous stress, anxiety and depression because of fear of contacting infection and associated morbidity. 9 Under these circumstances, reporting of minor clinical details such are presence of OSMF is less imperative. However, if we add 'presence or absence of OSMF' in the checklist of case history format of COVID-19 patients, we would then be able to draw some interesting conclusions. Since diagnosis of OSMF is purely clinical in nature and no imaging or laboratory procedure is needed, it can be incorporated in the case history format without causing much burden to the frontline workers.",
