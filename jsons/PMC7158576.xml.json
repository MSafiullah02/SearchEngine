The genus Rattus contains at least 56 species (retrieved January 28, 2014, from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System online database http://www.itis.gov); however, the Norway rat, R. norvegicus, and the black rat, R. rattus, are the two species most commonly associated with the genus. Rattus rattus preceded R. norvegicus in migration from Asia to Europe and the Americas by several hundred years. The former species reached Europe in the 12th century, and the Americas in the 16th century; whereas, R. norvegicus emerged in the 18th century in Europe and in the 19th century in the Western Hemisphere. Globally, the Norway rat has largely displaced the black rat, probably because of the Norway rat\u2019s larger size and aggressiveness. The domestication and introduction of the albino R. norvegicus is rooted by its use in Europe and America in the 1800s as prey for a sport (rat baiting) in which individuals would wager on which terrier dog would most swiftly kill the largest number of rats confined to a pit. Because of the large numbers of rats needed for this sport, wild rats were purpose-bred, and albinos were selected out by some people as a hobby (Robinson, 1965, Mayhew, 1851).",

Savory used them in 1863 in protein studies (Savory, 1863), and J.M. Philipeaux, reported on the effects of adrenalectomy in albino rats in 1856 (Philipeaux, 1856). Rats were used in experiments only sporadically in Europe and North America until about 1890. Pivotal to the development of the rat for use in research were Henry H. Donaldson, and Milton Greenman at the Wistar Institute in the early 20th century, who did much to produce and define early stocks of laboratory rats (Lindsey, 1979).",

Characteristics such as a short gestation and a relatively short life span, docile behavior, and ready availability of animals with well-defined health and genetic backgrounds are responsible for the importance of the rat as a laboratory animal. The rat is a standard species for toxicological, teratological, and carcinogenesis testing by the pharmaceutical industry and governmental regulatory agencies. Its early use in behavioral, neurological, nutritional, and endocrinology studies continues today. The size of the rat enables it to be used for surgical procedures, varying from organ transplantation to vascular techniques. Although the number of commonly used inbred strains is dwarfed by those of the mouse, inbred rat strains do represent an important repertoire of disease models (Table 4.1\n).",

Wall, ceiling, and floor surfaces should be made of materials that allow for effective sanitation and that resist damage from normal use and manipulation of equipment. The environment of the room should be well controlled, to ensure animal well-being and to help limit variables to those of the experimental design. Although rats, like most other species, can adapt to changes in temperature and humidity, room temperatures within a range of 70\u201376\u00b0F and with a relative humidity of 30\u201370% are typically accepted as being appropriate. Twenty-four-hour temperature/humidity recorders, either located in animal rooms or as a component of an electronic environmental management system, are useful in detecting changes in environmental conditions. Practice over many years has shown that, in general, ventilation rates of 10\u201315 air changes/hour of fresh air are sufficient to compensate for heat load and the generation of NH3 and CO2 from animals. A stable photoperiod is necessary to avoid changes in reproductive behavior, food intake, and weight gain. A cycle of 12\u201314 h light and 10\u201312 h dark is typically used for rats. Rats are particularly susceptible to phototoxic retinopathy. There is evidence to indicate that light intensity at cage level should be between 130 and 325 lux to prevent retinopathy (National Research Council, 2011). Management precautions such as not having exposed cages on the top shelves of tall racks should be considered.",

Strategies for limiting the transfer of pathogens will vary according to the potential impact that infectious agents may have on a particular group of rats and the study in which they are being used. For instance, an appropriate-sized room or cubicle may reflect the space necessary to separate rats by such criteria as pathogen status, immunological status, vendor, protocol, or investigator. Modifications such as the incorporation of Class 100 flexible wall enclosures may be useful to help ensure the specific pathogen status of rats over an extended period of time. Because of stress produced by noise, rat rooms should be located distant from mechanical rooms, cage-washing centers, and species that are apt to produce noise (National Research Council, 2011).",

Unless there is an experimental need, rats should be housed in solid-bottom rather than in wire-bottom cages. This will help prevent pododermatitis and injuries that are more frequently associated with wire floors, and bedding within solid-bottom cages provides some minimum environmental enrichment. However, enrichment enhances animal well-being by providing stimulation of natural species behavior. The resulting psychological benefits to the animal also result in a more robust biological model system and can improve the quality of scientific data derived form those animals (National Research Council, 2011). The most frequently used materials for solid-bottom cages are polycarbonate and polypropylene. The former plastic is often preferred because it may be repeatedly autoclaved without damage and because its translucency allows for observation of animals. Various contact bedding materials are appropriate for rats (e.g., hardwood chips, ground corncob, cellulose sheets).",

            "text": "Rat eyes are exophthalmic, which increases the risk of injury from trauma and drying during anesthesia. The eyelids are well developed, and only the cornea is visible. The cornea is moistened by secretions from the lacrimal glands and the Harderian gland, which is located medially to the orbit. When a rat is stressed (e.g., because of malnutrition, dehydration, disease, or environmental factors) there can be an excessive secretion of Harderian gland products containing porphyrins, which is termed chromodacryorrhea. This results in a reddish secretion or crust located periorbitally and at the nares that may be a useful indicator of an illness or a husbandry problem (Moore, 1995). Interestingly, the porphyrins in these secretions will fluoresce, and it has been suggested that the Harderian gland may have a function as a modulator of light-mediated responses (Cui et al., 2003). The orbital venous plexus has a slightly different anatomy than the obrbital sinus observed in the mouse, but it is a useful site for blood collection in the anesthetized animal (Timm, 1979, Sharma et al., 2014). Rats do not have robust color vision and their ability to discriminate based on color is difficult to demonstrate. It does, however, appear that they do have dichromatic color vision with two types of cones, one of which is responsive to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths with a response centered around 359 nm (Koolhass, 1999, Jacobs et al., 2001). This shift to the UV as compared to human vision is accompanied by a relative insensitivity of rat vision to longer wavelengths, since both the long-wavelength cone pigment and rod pigment have a peak sensitivity around 505\u2013509 nm. This can be exploited by the use of dim red lighting (peak wavelengths greater than ~625 nm) generated using red bulbs or transparent red films/filters to view rats during their dark cycle, but it must be understood that intense red light (e.g., a bulb positioned close to the cage) can be perceived by the animals, and also that even dim red light can affect their photoperiodic physiology (McCormack and Sontag, 1980). Olfactory signals are strong determinants for behavior in the rat. Male rats recognize the social status of other males, females in estrus, and kinship by olfactory cues. Rats also detect alarm pheromones from other rats (Koolhass, 1999). The vomeronasal organ is critical for many pheromone responses (Liman, 1996).",

Except for the rat\u2019s high-frequency sensitivity, its hearing capability corresponds closely to that of other mammals (Kelly and Masterton, 1977). The ultrasonic range of hearing and vocalization in the 22- to 80-kHz range is used for a variety of positive and negative communications, such as those emitted by pups left alone by their dam, or by adults during sexual and aggressive behavior (Koolhass, 1999, Portfors, 2007). Because frequencies that are disruptive to rats may not even be audible to humans, it is important to minimize ultrasonic noise in animal facilities. Monitoring equipment capable of detecting ultrasound should be utilized when screening rodent housing or use areas for noise contamination, and care must be taken when selecting equipment to avoid those known to emit ultrasound including some models of occupancy sensors (Weigler et al., 2007) and some types of energy-efficient high-frequency electronic ballasts that are used to drive linear fluorescent lamps (personal experience; author G.O.).",

However, the refinement of ingredients within diet formulations may vary according to classifications of commercially available products. The three classifications of diets are (1) natural-ingredient, (2) purified, and (3) chemically defined. The most commonly used type for most research applications is the natural-ingredient diet, composed of agricultural products and by-products. This class of diet can be either an open-formula diet, in which the information on the amount of each ingredient is available, or a closed-formula diet, in which such information is held confidential by the producer. The nutrient composition of ingredients in natural-ingredient diets varies from batch to batch because of various factors (e.g., relative costs of grains, weather conditions, harvesting and storage conditions, and concentrations of contaminants). Certified, natural-ingredient diets are used for toxicological and other Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies because each lot is assayed and certified not to exceed established maximum concentrations of a set list of contaminants (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and estrogens) that could influence study results.",

Chemically defined diets are formulated with very basically defined ingredients (e.g., specific amino acids, sugars, triglycerides, and essential fatty acids). These diets are costly and tend to lack palatability (National Research Council, 1996). A comprehensive description of the nutrient requirements of rats is available (National Research Council, 1995). Phytoestrogens are being increasingly recognized as a dietary variable that can have significant effects in both female and male rats (Boettger-Tong et al., 1998, Weber et al., 2001).",

However, there are numerous reports that demonstrate that unlimited feeding of rats on long-term carcinogenesis and toxicological studies reduces longevity and increases the incidence of neoplasia relative to rats fed at 70\u201380% of the ad libitum food amount. These effects have been found in Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, and F-344 rats and have caused increased variability among 2-year carcinogenicity and safety assessment studies, compromising the usefulness of bioassays in risk assessment (Keenan et al., 1996). For instance, Wistar rats fed 80% of ad libitum beginning at 16 weeks of age had very significant reductions in the incidence of lung, mammary, pancreatic islet cell, and pituitary tumors relative to controls fed ad libitum. The overall incidence of malignant tumors was 16% in the feed-limited group and 37% in the ad libitum group, even though the feed-limited group had a greater longevity. There was also a reduction in chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the heart, acute inflammation of the prostate, radiculoneuropathy, and acinal hyperplasia of the mammary gland in feed-limited animals (Roe et al., 1995). Four pathways have been implicated as potentially mediating the caloric restriction effect. These are the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)/insulin signaling pathway, the sirtuin pathway, the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway (Speakman and Mitchell, 2011).",

            "text": "In the rat, the vagina is closed at birth by compact epithelium, referred to as the vaginal plate (Del Vecchio, 1992). This begins to degenerate and cornify at 20\u201335 days of age and is completely open between 40 and 80 days of age. Persistence of the vaginal plate can result in a fully imperforate vagina or in the presence of a vaginal septum, anomalies that may be associated with infertility or metritis (Lezmi et al., 2011). Vaginal opening can be used as an external indicator of impending puberty in female rats, and a similar phenomenon, preputial separation, occurs in male rats (Korenbrot et al., 1977). A study in Wistar rats documented vaginal opening in control females at approximately 36 days of age and balano-preputial separation in control males at approximately 46 days of age (Engelbregt et al., 2000). Puberty is defined as the onset of sexual maturity indicated by the ability to bear viable young, and it occurs before full body size and weight are attained. As in most species, puberty occurs in females earlier than in males and also varies with stock or strain. Puberty most often occurs at 2\u20133 months of age in the rat (Fox and Laird, 1970), although considerable variation exists in reported values. Kohn and Barthold (1984) report 40\u201360 days, Bennett and Vickery (1970) report 50\u201372 days, and Ayala et al. (1998) report 45\u201347 days. Estrus, which should be distinguished from puberty, begins before full reproductive competency is reached and has been reported to occur at 36 days in the Wistar rat (Eckstein et al., 1973). However, some authors report successfully breeding Wistar BH rats at 35 days of age (Rosen et al., 1987).\n",

Interestingly, on histologic examination of young rat testes, more degenerate germ cells are noted prior to 75 days of age than afterward, indicative of the poor efficiency of spermatogenesis at early ages in the rat (Russell et al., 1987). Male sexual behavior is, in part, dependent on age and experience. Prepubertal males have no preference for females in estrus, and female-oriented sexual behavior is reported to decrease after 150 days of age (Matuszczyk et al., 1994, Smith et al., 1992). Decreased serum testosterone may be partially responsible for age-related decreases in mating behavior, but this does not appear to completely explain the phenomenon.",

Multiple series of intromissions and ejaculations occur, usually about seven, with increasing refractory periods between successive episodes.

            "text": "Several methods can be used to determine if a rat is in estrus, which is useful in production of timed pregnant rats. Rats in estrus often exhibit specific behavior, including ear quivering when the back or head are stroked, and lordosis (\u2018sway-back\u2019 posture) when the pelvic area is stimulated (Blandau et al., 1941). Additionally, the vulva becomes swollen, and the vaginal wall appears dry in estrus, instead of the moist pink appearance during metestrus or diestrus. This is due to cornification of the vaginal epithelium during estrus (Baker, 1979). These changes in the vaginal epithelium can be assessed by cytologic examination of vaginal smears (Montes and Luque, 1988). In estrus, 25\u2013100% of the epithelial cells are cornified (Bennett and Vickery, 1970). Changes in vaginal fluids and cytology also lead to changes in the electrical impedance in the vagina during estrus. This has been widely exploited as an alternative method of estrus detection (Koto et al., 1987a, Koto et al., 1987b) using a device referred to as an impedance meter in which an electrical probe is inserted into the vagina. However, when compared to cytology, impedance measurement provides less information regarding the specific phase of estrus, and the physical stimulation of the probe may induce pseudopregnancy (Singletary et al., 2005).",

Chronic exposure to even low-intensity light during the dark cycle has been reported to result in earlier vaginal opening and ovarian atrophy (Beys et al., 1995, Fox and Laird, 1970). Caloric restriction, a 15\u201330% decrease from ad libitum caloric intake, may cause cessation of estrous cycles and delayed sexual maturation (Fox and Laird, 1970).",

Approximately 1.5\u20134 h before the first pup is born, clear mucoid fluid discharges from the vagina. In early labor, the female walks about the cage and stretches. This behavior becomes more exaggerated as events progress; then the female will lie on her abdomen with rear legs extended off the cage floor.

Wistar BH rats had an average of 1.69 more pups (11.80 vs. 10.11) when first mated at 105 days than when first mated at 35 days of age (Rosen et al., 1987). The second litter is usually the largest (Bennett and Vickery, 1970). After 9 months of age, litter size is further decreased, and the pregnancy rate declines after 12 months of age (Niggeschulze and Kast, 1994). Loss of fetuses, termed pregnancy wastage, occurs as a function of age (Mattheij and Swarts, 1991), with less than 5% wastage in 4-month-old rats, 30% in 9-month-old rats, and 65% at 11 months of age. Wastage is primarily due to preimplantation and early postimplantation mortality. In contrast to the decremental effects of aging on litter size, maternal behavior in virgin rats is enhanced at 19\u201320 months, when compared with those at 3\u20134 months of age (Gonzalez and Deis, 1990). In addition, at least some maternal stressors can lead to fetal wastage. An increase in fetal wastage was reported to be due to an earthquake that occurred when the dams were at 7, 8, or 9 days of gestation, although no difference was noted in the number of live births, fetal weight, or incidence of runts (Fujinaga et al., 1992). This raises the possibility of similar fetal loss when rats are shipped at this stage of gestation, although such has not been documented in the peer-reviewed literature. Strenuous maternal exercise, i.e., running on a treadmill, has also been reported to result in decreased litter size and decreased fetal weight (Mottola et al., 1992). Dystocia is rare in rats. Cannibalism is not frequently encountered and is an indicator of maternal stress.",

            "text": "Rat pups are altricial and nidicolous; they are hairless and blind, with poorly developed limbs, short tails, and closed ear canals (Baker, 1979). There is an inverse relationship between fetal or birth weight and litter size (Romero et al., 1992). This phenomenon is significant for the reproductive toxicologist because the tendency of a test substance to cause decreased fetal weight may be masked if it also causes fetal loss. Other factors also influence birth weight and weaning weight, including the age of the dams. Pups of dams mated at 105 days of age weighed more at weaning than pups of dams mated at 35 or 70 days (Rosen et al., 1987). The external acoustic meati open between 2.5 and 3.5 days of age. Internally, the cochlea and organ of Corti are immature at birth but develop rapidly to approximately adult morphology by the time of weaning. Rats appear to first be able to hear at about 9 days of age, although they are able to vocalize from the time of birth (Feldman, 1992). Incisors erupt at 6\u20138 days of age, although molars do not erupt until 16 (molar 1), 18 (molar 2), and 32\u201334 days of age (molar 3) (Brown and Leininger, 1992). The retina is poorly developed at birth, equivalent to a human fetus of 4\u20135 months. The eyelids open at about 14\u201317 days of age, although the retina does not fully mature until 30\u201340 days of age, and the final components in the angle of the anterior chamber are not fully formed until 60 days of age (Weisse, 1992). Some hairs may be present on the trunk at birth, usually associated with touch domes, indicating that they are guard hairs (English and Munger, 1992). Pups are considered fully haired at about 7\u201310 days of age. Maternal antibody is transferred passively across the yolk sac in utero (Laliberte et al., 1984). Antibody can also be transferred across the intestinal mucosa from maternal colostrum and milk in the suckling rat. This transfer occurs at low rates shortly after birth, reaches maximal rates at day 14, and ceases by the 21 days, when gut closure is said to be complete (Martin et al., 1997).",

A technique for sex determination of preblastocyst embryos has also been described (Utsumi et al., 1991). Male embryos ceased development in the presence of antibody to the HY antigen, and resumed development only after the antibody was washed off. In contrast, 80% of the embryos that developed into blastocysts in the presence of the HY antibody produced female pups after the blastocysts were implanted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers constructed from sequences found in the male sex determining region Y (SRY) have been used to determine the sex of embryonic tissues during postmortem analysis (Miyajima et al., 2009).",

For this reason, electroejaculation may have more practicality as a method for evaluation of reproductive soundness in male rats (McCoy et al., 2013). For artificial insemination or sperm cryopreservation, epididymal sperm is most commonly collected during a terminal dissection. Sperm harvested from the proximal portion (head) of the cauda epididymis are reported to have greater fertility than sperm for the middle (body) or caudal (tail) portions (Moore and Akhondi, 1996). Once collected, sperm may be surgically introduced directly into the uterus of estrous females (Nakatsukasa et al., 2003). An essential step in ensuring the success of AI is the induction of pseudopregnancy in the recipient female by prior mating with a vasectomized male, by mechanical stimulation of the vagina, or by electrical stimulation of the cervix (Bennett and Vickery, 1970, Rouleau et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Embryo transfer in rats is used as an alternative to cesarean rederivation in order to eliminate pathogens from breeding lines. Embryo transfer can also be used as a research technique to investigate whether specific characteristics are due to, or modified by, the uterine environment, in contrast to being solely determined by genetic factors (Kubisch and Gomez-Sanchez, 1999, Rouleau et al., 1993). Cryopreservation techniques allow harvested embryos to be stored for long periods prior to subsequent implantation. Hormonal superovulation of rats is commonly performed using pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in a fashion similar to that used in mice, although other methods involving follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) with or without luteinizing hormone (LH) have also been utilized (Corbin and McCabe, 2002). For embryo manipulation, depending on the development stage required, embryos are collected 1\u20135 days after the females are bred. When embryo transfer is being used as a rederivation method, embryos are then suspended in PBS with BSA and fetal calf serum and surgically transferred into the uterus or oviduct of the pseudopregnant recipient (Kubisch and Gomez-Sanchez, 1999, Rouleau et al., 1993). Nonsurgical implantation of embryos through the cervix, using an otoscope, has also been reported (Bennett and Vickery, 1970) but has not found wide use. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is performed in the rat but is used primarily as a research tool for events in fertilization and early development rather than as a colony management tool (Gaddum-Rosse et al., 1984; Vanderhyden et al., 1986). Microinsemination of individual oocytes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a specific IVF technique that has the potential for being used to rescue or maintain strains that do not produce motile spermatozoa, as it has been used in mice (Tanemura et al., 1997, Songsasen and Leibo, 1998). By adding exogenous DNA to the process, it can also be exploited as a method for producing transgenic rats (Hirabayashi et al., 2005).",

In addition to being used for murine reproductive purposes, frozen embryos are also used to test culture reagents and environments for human IVF (Meyer et al., 1997). Although embryos, two-cell through morula, are most frequently cryopreserved, the techniques for cryopreservation of mouse sperm have been developed (Songsasen and Leibo, 1998, Tanemura et al., 1997).

Rats from a Sprague-Dawley background (such as the CD and SD stocks) and Lewis rats are generally more docile than Brown Norway or F-344 rats. Frequent gentle handling will increase docility, which not only reduces the likelihood of occupational injury for animal workers but also avoids stress for the rats. Infrequent or rough handling will evoke fear responses and is used as a stressor in research projects. The presence or absence of acclimation to handling of both pre- and postweaning animals can modulate subsequent handling-induced stress and lead to altered responses in behavioral studies in animals (Hirsjarvi and Valiaho, 1995, Shalev et al., 1998) and \u2018playful\u2019 handling can be a refinement to reduce stresss when performing procedures such as injections (Cloutier et al., 2014). Handling also leads to vocalizations, often in the range of 22 kHz, typical for rat alarm calls (Brudzynski, 2009). Stress-induced vocalization from rats in one cage can make handling more difficult or have an effect on the behavior of other rats within hearing range (Brudzynski and Chiu, 1995). An additional interesting fact regarding rat vocalization, illustrative of its importance in rat behavior, is that rat pups vocalize in the ultrasonic range, probably to signal their mothers, even before their ears are sufficiently developed for them to be capable of hearing (Feldman, 1992).",

The 2011 revision of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals strongly recommends that members of social species such as rats be housed in compatible groups whenever possible (National Research Council, 2011). However, as the emphasis on group housing begins to change the way institutions care for their animals, it needs to be recognized that a shift from single to group housing can function as a significant variable in a broad range of experimental studies. Such changes should be discussed with all groups involved so that the potential effects on the research study can be explored proactively by consulting the relevant literature, and also so that unanticipated effects can be recognized and evaluated retrospectively.",

Some of these organisms have been used in experimental infections in rats, but only once have they been associated with naturally occurring disease. In this single report, Group B streptococci were linked to myocarditis and abscesses found in a few 21- to 24-day old pups of a Munich Wistar\u2013Fr\u00f6mter line transgenic for human diphtheria toxin (Shuster et al., 2013). Exclusion of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci from most rat colonies is neither necessary nor practical, for humans are often carriers. Enterococcus spp., which are not truly streptococci, are often considered together with Streptococcus spp. So-called streptococcal enteropathy is actually due to nonhemolytic (\u03b3-hemolytic) Lancefield group D enterococci, including Enterococcus hirae, E. faecium-durans 2, and E. faecalis 2 (Barthold, 1997). Streptococcal enteropathy is a disease that affects only suckling rats, not postweaning animals. Affected litters develop diarrhea or soft stools, with bright yellow pasty feces. Mortality can be high. Microscopically, the villi of the small intestine are carpeted with gram-positive cocci. Disease is clearly associated with some strains of enterococci and not with others, but the factors determining the pathogenic potential have not been elucidated. They may, however, involve the ability of pathogenic isolates to adhere to the surface of the microvilli. Control of Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. is problematic, because the organisms are widespread, including being cultivable in a high percentage of the human population (Del Vecchio, 1992). Some Enterococcus spp. have even been considered autochthonous flora of the rat (Savage, 1971). Streptococci can be excluded by aseptic microisolator technique or by use of isolators (Pleasants, 1974), yet the low incidence of disease may not warrant the additional time, expense, or other resources that such housing techniques would require.",

Caseous necrosis is often prominent, and epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells may be present in areas of abscessation.

Latent infections may be triggered to become clinical by a variety of stressors that can cause immunosuppression in the host. These include poor husbandry, overcrowding, shipping, malnutrition, intercurrent infections, irradiation, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (Barthold and Brownstein, 1988). As with other persistent infections, such as mycoplasmosis, disease is more frequent in older animals. Definitive diagnosis is accomplished by bacteriologic culture (Fox et al., 1987) or PCR (Jeong et al., 2013). The best site, other than lesions, to culture is probably the submandibular (cervical) lymph nodes. The oral cavity, cecum, colon, and rectum may also harbor the organism. As feces have been identified in mice as a suitable culture site, they may also be a suitable sample for PCR, although this has not been confirmed in rats. Microscopic evaluation of lesions may reveal the characteristic irregularly branching arrays of gram-positive rods in tissue sections (Brown and Brenn stain) or impression smears (Gram\u2019s stain). However, if possible, histopathology should always be confirmed by bacteriology or PCR. Serology has also been widely employed for detection of C. kutscheri infection in immunocompetent rats (Fox et al., 1987, Boot et al., 1995). As with other serologic assays, especially serologic assays for agents more antigenically complex than viruses, false positives and false negatives occasionally occur, so positive results should always be confirmed by culture or PCR.",

Tissue smears may facilitate rapid diagnosis; Giemsa-stained smears of suspicious liver lesions are especially useful (Percy and Barthold, 2007). In the liver, the organisms are most often observed in surviving hepatocytes at the periphery or within lesions. In the intestine, normal gut flora within mucosal crypts and superimposed upon the mucosal epithelial cells may complicate evaluation. Organisms may also occasionally be observed in cardiac myocytes or myocytes of the tunica muscularis of the intestine. Colony screening for latent infection is problematic. Serologic screening is rapid and technically simple (Motzel and Riley, 1992) but is subject to false positives, yielding results that can be difficult to put into context, as has been recently reported in rabbits (Pritt et al., 2010). Disease provocation tests, or stress tests, to exacerbate latent infections are sometimes used as a follow-up test when serologic positive results are obtained. However, there is some doubt as to efficacy of stress tests that rely on chemical immunosuppression, usually with cyclophosphamide (Boivin et al., 1990), followed by histopathologic evaluation. The doubt arises because test animals may have already cleared the C. piliforme infection and therefore may no longer be susceptible to activation of \u2018latent\u2019 infection. Alternatively, sentinel animals can be placed on soiled bedding, but this may require sentinels to be of the same species (to avoid species specificity causing false negatives), for not even gerbils are susceptible to all strains of C. piliforme (Motzel and Riley, 1992, Franklin et al., 1994). PCR is also useful, as it is a sensitive and specific method to detect DNA from the organism. Thus, it can be used on fecal samples (Furukawa et al., 2002), but will only detect animals which have not cleared infection. It can be used on ileum, cecum or colon, but only during the period when organisms are present. PCR is useful for screening grossly observed liver lesions for C. piliforme, and can additionally be used on paraffin-embedded tissues as a confirmatory test following histopathologic evaluation.",

Thus, athymic nude mice are not subject to a high incidence of pseudomoniasis unless irradiated or treated with myelosuppressive agents. In general, pseudomoniasis is considered to be of low significance in rats (National Research Council, 1991) but should be suspected when rats that are irradiated or treated with radiomimetic agents die earlier than expected (Percy and Barthold, 2007). In particular, pseudomoniasis has been reported as a consequence of infection of indwelling jugular catheters (Wyand and Jonas, 1967). Signs were those of septicemia. Necropsy findings included vegetative valvular endocarditis and multifocal hemorrhagic pneumonia. Histologically, fibrin emboli, leukocytes, and gram-negative bacteria were observed in the heart, lung, and occasionally other organs.",

Animals must be maintained in isolators or microisolators and must be routinely monitored. All possible sources of contamination from human skin or any wet surface must be strictly prohibited. Control of P. aeruginosa infection often begins with the watering system. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of many bacteria that form biofilms, layers of bacteria, usually with reduced metabolic activity, embedded in a dense glycocalyx. Bacteria in a biofilm are extraordinarily resistant to chlorine (150- to 3000-times more resistant than free-floating bacteria) and monochloramine (2- to 100-fold; LeChevallier et al., 1988) and may be inaccessible to antibiotics. Nonetheless, chlorination (10\u201313 ppm) or acidification (pH 2.5\u20133.0) can significantly reduce the colonization of mice with P. aeruginosa but will not eliminate infection. Rederivation by cesarian section or embryo transfer is required to eliminate P. aeruginosa from an infected colony. Treatment with gentamycin in the animal drinking water, at 1 g/l, has been reported to eliminate the infection in mice but is probably not practical for large groups of rats (Urano et al., 1977).",

Lesions reported in athymic nude rats infected with H. bilis are similar to those reported in immunodeficient mice inoculated with H. bilis or H. hepaticus and include proliferative and ulcerative typhlitis, colitis, and proctitis (Haines et al., 1998), although no causal role was confirmed. No lesions due to any naturally occurring Helicobacter species have been reported in immunocompetent laboratory rats. The only report of lesions in rats due to natural Helicobacter infection involved a small group of 11 male athymic nude rats, 5\u20138 months of age, infected with H. bilis (Haines et al., 1998). In these rats, gross lesions consisted of focal or diffuse thickening of the cecal wall, with normal-appearing colon and rectum. Cystic mesenteric lymph nodes were also noted in eight of the 11 rats. Histologically, all 11 rats had proliferative typhlitis, with eight of the animals also having similar lesions in the colon and rectum. Crypt epithelium was hyperplastic, with cytoplasmic basophilia, increased mitoses, and fewer goblet cells than normally observed. The lamina propria was infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and a few eosinophils. Mucosal erosion and ulceration were observed in the cecum of the most severely affected rats. The authors experimentally reproduced many aspects of the disease by intraperitoneal injection of approximately 5 \u00d7 108\nH. bilis bacteria in phosphate-buffered saline. Helicobacter infection should, therefore, be a prime differential diagnosis when proliferative lesions of the large bowel are observed in rats. Spontaneous chronic ulcerative colitis has also been reported in athymic nude rats apparently free of Helicobacter infection (Thomas and Pass, 1997). The authors were unable to culture Helicobacter spp. from affected animals, although no molecular techniques were employed.",

Interestingly, because infection is not readily transmitted by soiled bedding (Cundiff et al., 1995b), many sentinel programs may fail to detect CAR bacillus infection. Infection is lifelong, and the organisms are readily retrievable by tracheal lavage or scraping (Medina et al., 1998). Therefore, CAR bacillus may be readily detected by PCR (Cundiff et al., 1994), which may serve as an important confirmatory test to follow positive serologic results.

Host factors include age, strain (Davis and Cassell, 1982), immune status and lymphoreticular function, and the presence of intercurrent infections such as Sendai virus (Schoeb et al., 1985); host nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin A and E deficiencies may exacerbate disease (Tvedten et al., 1973). Mycoplasma isolates may also vary in virulence (Davidson et al., 1988). Environmental factors may include intracage ammonia, temperature, humidity, etc. (Schoeb et al., 1982). Mycoplasma pulmonis possibly damages host cells by causing dysfunction and/or loss of cilia (Kohn, 1971), which is a likely cause of the accumulation of exudate, opportunistic bacterial infections, and impaired transport of ova (infertility). Mycoplasma pulmonis competes for the host cell nutrients and metabolites (Cassell et al., 1986) and may also produce toxic metabolites, such as peroxides and nonspecific mitogens (Naot et al., 1979a, Naot et al., 1979b). The latter may cause proliferation of autoreactive clones of lymphocytes, leading to the host becoming a victim of its own immune system. Mycoplasma pulmonis successfully evades the host\u2019s immune defenses, so infection and some lesions (especially those in the upper respiratory tract) are persistent and often progressive. The exact mechanism by which M. pulmonis evades the host immune system, however, is unknown.",

This classic lesion of MRM is rare in recent years. Arthritis may rarely be observed. No genital tract lesions are usually observed, but occasionally partially resorbed fetuses and suppurative salpingitis may be found. Histopathologically (Kohn and Kirk, 1969, Percy and Barthold, 2007), airway lesions in the respiratory tract are usually characterized by suppurative exudate, hyperplasia (squamous metaplasia) of mucosal epithelium, and often striking hyperplasia of the bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) that could even potentially be confused with lymphoma. Other respiratory tract lesions include pseudoglandular hyperplasia of the nasal epithelium in chronic cases, and hyperplasia of peribronchial alveolar type II pneumocytes. CAR bacillus and/or other secondary bacterial pneumonias also frequently accompany MRM. Lesions in the female genital tract of rats with mycoplasmosis may include suppurative oophoritis and salpingitis, or hydrosalpingitis, and chronic suppurative endometritis or pyometra.",

Regular and periodic serologic testing within colonies of rats and mice should be done to help prevent and control infection within rodent housing facilities. While the prevalence of infection is likely low in wild rats, the latter remain a potential source of infection if not appropriately controlled (Easterbrook et al., 2008). Moreover, the use of Sendai virus as a research tool continues and these studies also serve as a source of potential infection. PCR testing should be done on all transplantable tumors, cell lines, and other biological materials to prevent transmission of Sendai virus from infected materials to recipient animals (Bauer et al., 2004). Of note, Sendai virus is not readily detected in indirect sentinel monitoring of programs of mice (Artwohl et al., 1994, Compton et al., 2004). Thus sentinel programs may fail to detect this infection, but the limited transmission may also prevent inadvertent infection from wild rodents or experimental studies. If Sendai virus is introduced into a rat colony of immunocompetent rats, neutralizing antibody in infected rats renders the infection self-limiting. Accordingly, if antibody-naive rats are not introduced and if pregnant and preweanling rats are killed and breeding is halted, the virus will be eliminated from the colony within 4\u20138 weeks (Jacoby and Gaertner, 2006). This presumes that either all rats in the colony have been exposed, as might occur where rats are housed in open-top cages, or that all further interindividual transmission is prevented, so that no new infections occur during the clearing, or \u2018burnout\u2019 phase, which could perpetuate the infection.",

This species contains several distinct serotypes, including murine hepatitis virus and rat coronaviruses. The two prototype coronaviruses in rats are Parker\u2019s rat coronavirus (RCV-P) and sialodacryoadenitis virus (RCV-SDA). In addition to these two coronavirus strains, there are others that have been isolated and found to differ antigenically from either RCV-P or RCV-SDA. Historically, RCV-P and RCV-SDA were considered to induce two rather distinct sets of clinical signs and types of lesions in rats (Jacoby and Gaertner, 2006). More recently, however, the clinical signs, pathogenicity, and histological lesions are considered to be variable but similar for both RCV-P and RCV-SDA, and defining the neutralization group of a new RCV isolate is not useful in predicting its pathogenic potential (Compton et al., 1999). Moreover, because these are highly mutable coronaviruses, field isolates may exhibit additional genetic and antigenic differences, but are likely capable of inducing a similar spectrum of disease. The antigenic differences between RCV-P and RCV-SDA are significant enough to allow cross-infection with either virus. Probably the most important point to be made from a clinical perspective is that neutralizing antibodies to one virus prototype will not offer significant cross protection from the other virus strain, thus allowing viral shedding and recurrence of clinical signs and lesions, albeit diminished (Percy and Barthold, 2007, Jacoby, 1986, Bihun and Percy, 1994, Kojima and Okaniwa, 1991, Weir et al., 1990). However, with the low prevalence of these viruses in contemporary laboratory rat colonies, this scenario is unlikely to occur.",

During outbreaks, morbidity is high, but mortality is very low (Percy and Barthold, 2007). Virus is present in target tissues for about 1 week after exposure, at which time heightened antibody levels render the infection self-limiting. However, immunity is not lifelong. Under experimental conditions, it has been shown that rats are susceptible to reinfection with a homologous strain as early as 6 months after initial infection and that such rats are able to transfer infection to naive rats by cage contact. However, the severity of lesions in reinfected rats is minimal compared with those associated with primary infections (Percy et al., 1990, Weir et al., 1990). Differences in pathogenicity have been reported among a few rat strains (Jacoby and Gaertner, 2006, Carthew and Slinger, 1981).",

These signs are transient, lasting for a week or less. The second type of clinical picture is associated with a sudden onset of clinical signs in naive postweanling-to-adult rats that have been exposed to infected rats. Signs include cervical swelling due to inflammation and edema of submaxillary salivary glands (Fig. 4.7\n), nasal and ocular discharges that are usually porphyrin stained, photophobia, corneal opacities, and corneal ulcers.

            "text": "Preventing transfer of this highly contagious coronavirus to naive colonies is predicated upon preventing entry of infected rats into a facility through knowledge of the pathogen status of vendor colonies and an effective quarantine program. Like most viral agents of rats, the prevalence of RCV in laboratory rats is declining markedly (Liang et al., 2009, Livingston and Riley, 2003, Mahler and Kohl, 2009, McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-Van De Ven et al., 2006). However, in one report, this agent was prevalent in wild rats, so effective control of the latter is of paramount importance (Easterbrook et al., 2008). Control of infection within a colony or facility is based upon the fact that rats shed the virus for only about 1 week, after which they are immune and not latently infected. The virus is not transmitted vertically. Eliminating rat coronavirus from a colony is achieved by allowing the virus to spread quickly to all animals, preventing entry of susceptible rats to the room, and suspension of breeding and removal of preweanlings. The rapidity in which all animals will seroconvert and no longer shed the virus will determine the period of time needed before susceptible animals can be safely introduced or breeding resumed. In most instances, a 6- to 8-week period should be allowed (Jacoby and Gaertner, 2006). Alternatively, if suspension of breeding cannot be done, a method to continue breeding and eliminate SDA is to define a subset of the breeding colony that is seropositive and to relocate these breeding animals to a separate room, allow litters to be born in the original colony until the relocated breeders are in late gestation, and then kill all animals in the original colony (Brammer et al., 1993).",

In the 1980s, testing of rat sera indicated the presence a parvovirus that was neither RV nor H-1. This virus, which was initially referred to as rat orphan parvovirus (OPV), is now designated rat parvovirus (RPV; Jacoby et al., 1996).

RV-contaminated bedding, stored at room temperature for up to 5 weeks, is capable of inducing seroconversion of rats for up to 5 weeks (Yang et al., 1995). Rats may harbor and transmit RV long after seroconversion occurs, with the frequency of persistent infection during natural outbreaks (Gaertner et al., 1996) and experimental infections (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2001) being RV strain-dependent. After experimental inoculation of RV into neonatal rats, the virus persists in tissues for up to 14 weeks, and the duration of infectivity to cage contacts up to 10 weeks. Infection of pregnant females also results in persistent infection of progeny; however pups of persistently infected dams are protected, presumably by maternal antibody (Jacoby et al., 2001). If weanling rats are inoculated, the duration of viral recovery and infectivity is decreased to 7 and 3 weeks, respectively (Paturzo et al., 1987, Jacoby et al., 1988).

In such colonies, reduced litter size, runted litters, and fetal and neonatal death may be observed. Although subclinical infections in postweanling rats are the rule, an outbreak characterized by hemorrhage and necrosis of the brain, testes, and epididymides has been reported in young adult rats (Coleman et al., 1983). The ability of RV to cross the placenta appears to depend on the virus strain, dose, and time of gestation. Resistance to lethal infection develops during the first postpartum week (Gaertner et al., 1996, Jacoby et al., 1988). Serological surveys of rat colonies have indicated that rat parvoviruses, especially RPV (Liang et al., 2009, Livingston and Riley, 2003, Mahler and Kohl, 2009, McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-Van De Ven et al., 2006, Clifford and Watson, 2008) are among the most prevalent viruses of contemporary research rat colonies; however, clinical disease is rarely reported. Natural infectious by H-1, RPV, and RMV have received very little study. To date, none have been associated with naturally occurring clinical disease, suggesting that they are primarily subclinical infections (Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998, Wan et al., 2002, Weisbroth et al., 1998).",

Differential strain susceptibility has been identified with experimentally infected SD rats from one vendor exhibiting prolonged fecal shedding and higher infectivity and seroconversion when compared to SD rats from another vendor.

In one report, a test and cull strategy was shown to be effective in eliminating the virus from a contaminated colony (Dyson, 2010). Serological surveys, including those that previously used TMEV as an antigen suggest that RTV is of low to moderate prevalence in contemporary research rat colonies (Liang et al., 2009, Livingston and Riley, 2003, Mahler and Kohl, 2009, McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-Van De Ven et al., 2006).",

The prevalence of seropositive rat colonies was reported in 1982 to exceed 50%; however, today serological evidence of PVM infection is rare to non-existent in rats (Liang et al., 2009, Livingston and Riley, 2003, Mahler and Kohl, 2009, McInnes et al., 2011, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Schoondermark-Van De Ven et al., 2006). Diagnosis is typically accomplished by serology. PCRs are also available for detection of active infections with trachea or lungs, the sites of infection, serving as optimal samples for testing. The virus does not cause clinical disease, but multifocal, nonsuppurative vasculitis and interstitial pneumonitis with necrosis are prominent lesions seen in the acute phase of the disease. These lesions persist for several weeks. Historically, the virus was considered to be a significant co-pathogen with other respiratory agents such as Mycoplasma pulmonis, and cross species transmission is a potential concern (Percy and Barthold, 2007).",

The authors who first reported this disease named it \u2018infectious diarrhea of infant rats\u2019 (Vonderfecht et al., 1984) so it is sometimes referred to by the acronym, IDIR. Affected infant rats excreted feces that varied from liquid to being poorly formed, and the animals displayed erythema and bleeding of the perianal skin. Pathology associated with infection included small intestinal villous atrophy, villous epithelial necrosis, and syncytial cell formation. This same agent was found to be associated with diarrhea in humans and has been shown by enzyme immunoassay inhibition assay to be prevalent in children and adults. Human isolates were shown to induce diarrhea in infant rats (Eiden et al., 1985, Vonderfecht et al., 1985). This suggests that under nonexperimental conditions there may be cross-infectivity between humans and rats. Although the virus is not frequently included in screening panels, commercial serology and PCR assays are available. The prevalence is unknown but generally thought to be low.",

Second, parenteral infections are rare in laboratory rats because of absence of vectors.

This is almost as sensitive as complete direct examination of the large bowel and is significantly less time-consuming. Examination for eggs must be tailored to the infesting species suspected. The perianal tape test is effective only for Syphacia spp., and fecal flotation or fecal concentration and centrifugation is effective for A. tetraptera (Parkinson et al., 2011). Screening for oxyurid eggs is significantly less sensitive than direct examination of the bowel for the adult helminths (Klement et al., 1996, West et al., 1992), although as a posttreatment diagnostic tool, perianal tape testing was found to be highly sensitive for S. muris infection (Hill et al., 2009). For optimal diagnostics, use of more than one diagnostic method is recommended (Effler et al., 2008). Recently, PCR assays have been developed, which add a highly sensitive methodology for detection of these agents (Feldman and Bowman, 2007, Parel et al., 2008, Parkinson et al., 2011). Because pinworm transmission to sentinel animals may be delayed, PCR testing may be particularly amenable to health monitoring programs as it allows for easy testing of colony animals.",

However, some treatments such as topical selemectin and diet-delivered moxidectin have been ineffective (Gonenc et al., 2006, Hill et al., 2006, Oge et al., 2000). Fenbendazole-medicated feed is perhaps the most common therapeutic because of its ovacidal, larvacidal, and adulticidal properties and the ease of use; ivermectin is not ovicidal (Pritchett and Johnston, 2002). However, when treating rats for pinworms, consideration should be given to potential effects of the anthelmintic. Ivermectin has known deleterious effects (reviewed in Pritchett and Johnston (2002)) whereas fenbendazole is considered either inconsequential or potentially detrimental to ongoing studies (Barron et al., 2000, Cray et al., 2008, Cray et al., 2013, Duan et al., 2012, Gao et al., 2008, Hunter et al., 2007b, Landin et al., 2009, Vento et al., 2008, Villar et al., 2007). Because ova can readily contaminate and persist in the environment (Lytvynets et al., 2013), decontamination of the latter may also be warranted. Heat, ethylene oxide formaldehyde gas, and chlorine dioxide with or without didecyl di-methyl ammonium chloride have been shown to be effective, while potassium peroxysulphate, alcohol/chlorhexidine, and ultraviolet light were not (Dix et al., 2004). Of note, treatment failures have occurred, but these likely involved lack of consideration of biology and risk factors associated with re-infection (Huerkamp et al., 2004). Oxyuriasis can also be eliminated by rederivation and is readily excluded by proper adherence to modern practices of barrier room technology (Hasslinger and Wiethe, 1987).",

The cysts are found in the livers of rats, mice, and hamsters and are up to several centimeters in diameter. They are readily identified by the presence in the cyst of a scolex, strobila, and bladder (Hsu, 1979). Although considered nonpathogenic (Baker, 2007), the cyst may be associated with the development of hepatic sarcomas, probably in a mechanism similar to the induction of sarcomas in the rat by a variety of foreign bodies (Altman and Goodman, 1979, Elcock et al., 2001). Because the definitive host is the cat, detection of the cysticercus is evidence that materials in the animals\u2019 immediate environment, usually feed, were contaminated with unsterilized feces from an infected cat. Control, therefore, is simple.",

It is primarily the ability to parasitize humans that gives R. nana significance, for it causes little damage in rats or mice. Furthermore, it is not clear whether or not human infestations represent infestation with distinct strains, i.e., whether or not the strains of R. nana present in rats are infective for humans (Baker, 2007). In the direct life-cycle (Hsu, 1979), which requires 14\u201316 days, embryonated eggs are ingested and hatch in the small intestine. The oncospheres penetrate villi and develop into cysticercoid larvae in 4\u20135 days. These larvae reenter the lumen, the scolex evaginates, and they attach to the mucosa. An additional 10\u201312 days are required before mature proglottids are formed. Adults live only a few weeks. Infection normally results in some level of immunity, which prevents autoinfection. When autoinfection occurs, eggs hatch in the small intestine and develop, without being passed in the feces, and can result in very high worm burdens. In the indirect life-cycle, grain beetles (Tenebrio molitor and T. obscurus) and fleas (Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalus canis, Xenopsylla cheopis) serve as intermediate hosts. Rats and other definitive hosts are infected by ingesting the intermediate host.",

Because mites or eggs may be found on different parts of the body (Metcalf Pate et al., 2011, Ricart Arbona et al., 2010b), examination of several sites is recommended. Studies comparing sensitivity of various assays have been performed in mice (Metcalf Pate et al., 2011) but are likely applicable to rats. Recently, PCR assays have been developed that show superior sensitivity to traditional techniques (Karlsson et al., 2014, Parkinson et al., 2011, Rice et al., 2013, Weiss et al., 2012, Jensen et al., 2013). These assays are also useful in assessment of posttreatment efficacy although animal environmental samples may remain positive for several weeks (Rice et al., 2013).

Compounds used include topical selemectin alone (Gonenc et al., 2006) or in conjunction with amitraz- and fipronil-treated nestlets (Bornstein et al., 2006), topical moxidectin (Mook and Benjamin, 2008, Pollicino et al., 2008, Pullium et al., 2005), and ivermectin (administered topically or in food or water) with or without cross fostering (Conole et al., 2003, Huerkamp et al., 2005, Ricart Arbona et al., 2010c). As with pinworm treatment, consideration should be given to possible effects of the treatment. For example, although uncommon, ivermectin has been associated with neurologic clinical signs in mice being treated for mite infestations (Ricart Arbona et al., 2010a). Of note, there are numerous anecdotal reports of infection recurrence, thus animals should be monitored regularly to ensure effective treatment. Infestation can also be eliminated by rederivation and is readily excluded by proper adherence to modern practices of barrier room technology.",

Clinical signs may range from none to anemia and debility with severe infestations. These mites can also carry a number of rodent pathogens. Moreover, they will bite humans and can carry several zoonotic diseases. Suspicion of mesostigmatid mite infestation often arises when animal care personnel are bitten. Diagnosis may be achieved by direct observation of blood engorged mites on rats or in the environment. Mites may also be found in sticky insect traps, although the latter may lack sensitivity as a sole diagnostic tool (Watson, 2008). Elimination of mites must include treatment of both animals and environment. Treatments reported to be effective include permethrin-impregnated cotton balls for mice and pyrethrin permethrin or dichlorvos treatment of the environment (Cole et al., 2005, Hill et al., 2005, Watson, 2008, Chu and Couto, 2005).",

The female lays eggs, called nits, which are cemented to hairs. The eggs have a distinct operculum, with a row of pores near the operculated end. The eggs hatch by a pneumatic mechanism in 5\u20136 days; the larvae ingest air through the pores, pass it through the body, and then use that pressure to force open the operculum (Owen, 1992). The young nymphs are paler than the yellow\u2013brown adults but are morphologically similar. After three ecdyses, or molts, they become adults. Depending on environmental conditions, the ecdyses require 1\u20133 weeks. The entire life-cycle is completed in 2\u20135 weeks. Adults live only 25\u201328 days. Transmission is by direct contact (Baker, 2007).\n",

In immunocompetent rats, lesions occur following infection, regardless of the age of the rats. P. carinii has a slow doubling time, estimated at 4.5 days (Aliouat et al., 1999), and does not appear to incite a host response until a population density threshold is reached. At that point, lesions begin to be visible and specific antibodies are produced. Thereafter, the population of P. carinii diminishes and the infection is eventually cleared. It is noteworthy that even at peak population, the number of organisms present is magnitudes less than the population densities achieved in immunodeficient rats.

At necropsy, red\u2013brown or tan lesions are scattered throughout the lung in a pattern typical of interstitial pneumonia. These lesions may be resolved after another 8\u201312 weeks. Microscopically, the lesions are characteristic enough they were reported as diagnostic for this disease (Albers et al., 2009) and this has been supported by subsequent molecular diagnosis (Henderson et al., 2012). Microscopic lesions will occur in 50\u2013100% of infected rats and are typically characterized as lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia. In Pneumocystis interstitial pneumonia in immunocompetent rats, alveolar septa are thickened with macrophages and lymphocytes, and alveoli contain macrophages, lymphocytes, and debris. Multinucleated giant cells may occasionally be present, and slight interstitial hemorrhage is common. Eosinophils and/or neutrophils are occasionally present but not a useful diagnostic criterion. The other hallmark of the histopathologic appearance is perivascular lymphocyte cuffing (Fig. 4.14\n). Bands, or cuffs, of macrophages and lymphocytes encircle interstitial arteries when the first lesions of interstitial pneumonia are observed. Over the next few weeks, lymphocytes come to predominate, and these lymphoid cuffs will persist after the infiltrates in the alveoli and septa have resolved. Increased BALT is not considered to be a major component of the lesions.",

Although this may be monitored to some degree in inbred rats by molecular techniques such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, it is more difficult to assess the degree to which it has occurred in outbred stocks, where expected interindividual variation may obscure intercolony differences. Nonetheless, any two colonies started from the same source will vary increasingly with time unless there is a sufficient and ongoing exchange of breeders between the colonies. Genetic drift within a population can also be reduced by careful adherence to specific outbreeding programs, such as line breeding with systematic exchange of breeders between multiple lines. \u2018Randomized\u2019 breeding is an important tool used to maintain genetic heterogeneity, but this is a carefully planned process that must not be confused with a haphazard approach that simply pairs \u2018random\u2019 animals.",

Second, rats store fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin B12, manufacture vitamin C, and can fulfill many of their requirements for other B vitamins by coprophagy. However, heat and moisture, such as are associated with autoclaving, can reduce vitamin levels, particularly lysine, vitamin A, vitamin E, riboflavin, and thiamin. Prolonged storage can have similar effects. In addition, diets designed for maintenance of adult rodents may be too low in protein and fat for optimal growth of young animals or successful reproduction. Clinical evidence of dietary insufficiency may include decreased reproductive performance, litter loss, poor growth, and sparse hair coat. Signs of severe deficiencies of specific vitamins are rare. If they occur, they include squamous metaplasia of salivary ducts with hypovitaminosis A, disseminated hemorrhage with hypovitaminosis K, and embryonic death and testicular degeneration with hypovitaminosis E. Nutritional deficiencies can also alter disease susceptibility and severity.",

High moisture content in bedding leads to rapid growth of bacteria, which can increase the incidence of urinary tract infections and, possibly, mastitis and skin lesions. Bacterial urease production in urine-saturated zones of bedding can increase ammonia levels. High moisture content in food may increase environmental fungal spore contamination through the proliferation of mold. Some softwood bedding materials emit aromatic compounds that may increase hepatic microsomal levels and affect responses to test compounds, although these compounds are usually completely sublimated during the drying phase in bedding manufacture.

For rats raised under very dim conditions (6 lux), functional and histological damage can occur with as little as 270 lux of irradiation as measured at the cage level with a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Beyond simple retinal injury, exposure to very high light levels of 1600 lux for 12 h each day for 8 days resulted in necrosis in Harderian glands, likely as a result of the photoreactive properties of the porphyrin secretions (Kurisu et al., 1996). Historically recommended room light levels are in the range of 325\u2013400 lux as measured 1 m above the floor (National Research Council, 2011). Note that these recommended levels as measured 1 m above the floor do not necessarily reflect actual light levels to which rats are exposed in individual cages at various levels in racks at varying distances from light fixtures. Light energy exposure from a generating source is a distance-squared function, so the exposure of animals in cages at the top levels of the rack can be greatly increased over those in the lower levels. This should be recognized as a potential study variable, and if retinal function or structure is to be evaluated as part of a study, the rack location of animals in various experimental groups should be randomized at the initiation of the study or uniformly rotated throughout the study. In addition to intensity-related adverse effects, disruption of the light:dark cycle and resulting exposure to constant light may cause anestrus and other breeding problems. Light exposure (contamination) during the dark phase of the light cycle, with light levels as low as 0.21 lux, has been reported to interfere with rat tumor and metabolism studies, and there are design and management strategies that can be utilized to minimize the physiologic disruptions of light leaks during the dark cycle (Dauchy et al., 2011).\n",

Most pituitary tumors are classified as chromophobe adenomas, originating from the pars distalis. In some reports, the prevalence of pituitary tumors is greater in female F-344 and Sprague-Dawley rats. Carcinomas of the pars distalis are reported with much less frequency; however, their reported prevalence may vary considerably because of differences in classification protocols by pathologists. As was previously noted, caloric restriction significantly reduces the incidence of pituitary tumors in rats.",

The right kidney is affected more often than the left. Severity of hydronephrosis can vary from a slight dilation of the renal pelvis to such severe dilation that the kidney appears as a transparent cystic structure. The ureter may also be affected to varying degrees. The normal renal pelvis of young animals may appear to be dilated, however, so some caution is required in identifying hydronephrosis (Maronpot, 1996).

Affected animals are functionally sterile if the septum is complete, and subfertile if the septum only partially prevents spermatozoa from entering the uterus. Pseudohermaphroditism is occasionally observed in rats, most often male pseudohermaphroditism, also known as testicular feminization; i.e., testes are present internally, but the external genitalia are approximately female. Affected rats are karyotypically XY but express the default feminine phenotype. Although mutant strains have been selected for this characteristic (Allison et al., 1965), it is also occasionally observed in other strains as well. In the testicular-feminized rat (tfm), the defect is a lack of androgen receptors due to a point mutation (Yarbrough et al., 1990), although defects in other genes could potentially result in similar syndromes.",

Because of the use of rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies, and as models of gerontology for humans, diseases of the geriatric rat have particular significance to the laboratory animal professional. The type, incidence, and severity of these lesions vary greatly with stock or strain of rat, infectious disease status, experimental manipulation, and husbandry practices, including dietary restriction. Only a few of the most common nonneoplastic conditions will be discussed here, and readers are encouraged to consult the scientific literature, perhaps starting with these excellent reviews for additional information concerning the particular stock or strain with which they are concerned (Boorman et al., 1990, Mohr et al., 1992). In addition, the National Toxicology Program Nonneoplastic Lesion Atlas available on the Internet at <http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/nnl/> is an excellent resource (Cesta et al., 2014). Neoplastic conditions are afforded a separate section in this chapter.",

            "text": "CPN is an important age-related disease of rat kidneys and is among the most common causes of death in rats in lifetime studies. Synonyms abound, including \u2018chronic progressive nephrosis\u2019 and \u2018old rat nephropathy\u2019. The condition is more common in males than in females and is progressive, as correctly indicated by its appellation (Hard and Khan, 2004). Gross lesions of CPN are first observed in rats more than 6 months of age and are characterized by pitting of the cortical surface. Because of cortical interstitial fibrosis, removal of the renal capsule may tear the cortical parenchyma. As it becomes more severe in rats more than 1 year of age, the cortical surface becomes increasingly irregular and may develop areas of pallor. Microscopically, glomerular changes are characterized by thickened basement membranes, thickening of the capillary tufts, adhesions to the parietal layer of Bowman\u2019s membrane, and segmental glomerulosclerosis (Short and Goldstein, 1992). As the disease advances, numerous tubules in both the cortex and medulla are often dilated and filled with eosinophilic proteinaceous casts. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may occur subsequent to renal functional compromise in advanced cases, resulting in widespread dystrophic mineralization. The etiopathogenesis of CPN is poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. However, several of the major contributing factors have been described (Barthold, 1996a, Percy and Barthold, 2007). First, the reported incidence varies with strain. This indicates probably at least some genetic predisposition for the development of CPN. Sprague-Dawley and F-344 rats have high incidences, whereas Wistar and Long-Evans stocks have a lower incidence. Reported incidences, however, are difficult to interpret, because of geographic variation in use of different stocks and strains (Wistar rats have been used more predominantly in Europe, and Sprague-Dawley rats in the United States), which could lead to other factors, such as housing and diet, actually causing what otherwise appears to be a strain-related change. For example, when many of the reports of the incidence of CPN in European rats were published, rats were housed five per cage, which is known to result in decreased feed consumption and decreased weight gain, relative to single housing. Second, gender is a determining factor in the development of CPN. Male rats have an earlier onset, higher incidence at any given age, and greater severity of lesions than do females. Third, diet is a critical factor and is also the factor that may be the most amenable to management solutions. It is now clear that moderate dietary restriction will greatly reduce the incidence and severity of CPN at any given age, relative to ad libitum overfeeding. The mechanism is hypothesized to be that overfeeding results in prolonged increases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (Gumprecht et al., 1993). This hyperfiltration causes glomerular hypertrophy, leading to macromolecule filtration deficits, mesangial damage, glomerulosclerosis, and protein leakage. Whatever the mechanism, however, 25\u201330% reduction in caloric intake, relative to ad libitum, results in decreased incidence and severity of CPN in female rats, and decreased severity of CPN in male rats, as well as increased survival in both sexes (Keenan et al., 1995).",

In contrast to CPN, which is more common in males, nephrocalcinosis is more common in female rats. In addition to gender, the incidence varies with age and strain and may occur in F-344 rats as young as 7 weeks old. The incidence in F-344 rats may reach 50%, whereas the lower incidence of 0\u20137% is reported in stocks of Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats (Montgomery and Seely, 1990). An especially high incidence is observed in BDIX rats. The incidence and severity of nephrocalcinosis may be increased by several dietary manipulations, including high levels of calcium, high phosphorus, low calcium/phosphorus ratios, or low magnesium (Percy and Barthold, 2007). However, it is not clear if dietary levels of these minerals are key determining factors in the background incidence of nephrocalcinosis. Histologically (Short and Goldstein, 1992), mineral deposition is observed most frequently at the corticomedullary junction, in cells of the pars recta and thin loops of Henle, as well as in the lumen of these tubules.",

The incidence of urolithiasis is generally low, but it bears brief discussion for a couple reasons. First, copulatory plugs (Percy and Barthold, 2007), very firm proteinaceous bodies formed by seminal fluids, can often be found in the bladders and urethras of male rats and are occasionally mistaken for uroliths. Copulatory plugs, however, are not considered to be lesions. Second, although uroliths are sporadically observed in aging rats of both sexes, their detection in rats less than six months of age usually indicates bacterial infection, with cystic uroliths most often associated with an ascending E. coli infection; renal uroliths, rare in younger rats, are more often associated with an embolic spread of infection. Rats predisposed to urinary tract infection such as the Zucker Diabetic Fatty rat, may have an elevated incidence, as do rats with hydronephrosis. Uroliths are usually calcium phosphate and struvite, although determination of the composition is rarely helpful.",

The condition is often known as cardiomyopathy, or chronic progressive cardiomyopathy, and may be observed as early as 3 months of age. Grossly, the heart is enlarged, occasionally with pale streaks visible. Increased weight of the heart correlates well with the degree of damage observed on histologic examination. Microscopically (Lewis, 1992), there is necrosis of myocardial fibers and an interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells. Later in the course of the disease, fibrosis may be more prominent. Large reactive nuclei are also observed in myofibers. The most commonly affected myocardial sites are the papillary muscles and interventricular septum. As with CPN, the incidence of chronic progressive cardiomyopathy can be dramatically reduced at any age by moderate dietary restriction, i.e., reduction of 25\u201330% of total caloric intake relative to ad libitum overfed rats (Keenan et al., 1995).",

This may be observed in any stock or strain but is especially common in the Brown Norway rat. Old albino rats also have a more yellow appearance at times, because of the accumulation of sebum in the skin. The rings of scales covering the tail increase in number with age to 190 at 1 year (English and Munger, 1992). They continue to become more prominent and more yellowed with time after that. The yellowish material which accumulates on the tail and adjacent to the ear also may become black with time, probably from oxidation and/or bacterial action. In addition, male rats accumulate brown-pigmented foci on the skin, termed scales (Tayama and Shisa, 1994). These scales can be detached and can overlay skin of \u2018normal\u2019 color. They are found on the dorsum, with some on the tail and perineum. Scale formation is abrogated by gonadectomy. The nature of the pigment is unclear, but it may be oxidized lipid or amino acids.",

The foci may extend slightly above the pleural surface in uninflated lung. Microscopically (Boorman and Eustis, 1990), clusters of alveoli, often in a subpleural locations or adjacent to a terminal bronchiole, contain increased numbers of large, pale, foamy-appearing macrophages. Occasionally, cholesterol clefts may be visible in the more dense aggregates of macrophages, and a slight infiltration of lymphocytes may be present around adjacent vessels, probably as a response to proinflammatory mediators released by the macrophages. Alveolar histiocytosis should not be mistaken for any of the viral pneumonias of rats, because affected animals are seronegative, and any lymphoid infiltrate is slight and localized to the areas of macrophage aggregation.
