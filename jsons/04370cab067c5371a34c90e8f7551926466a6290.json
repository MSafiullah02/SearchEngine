We attempt to report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. METHODS To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). RESULTS Compared to other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To raise the understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we grouped the period into four different phases: Phase 1 (there was confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases found in Yogyakarta), Phase 2 (the first case in Yogyakarta detected), Phase 3 (the time when the cumulative cases surpass its peak), and Phase 4 (the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in Phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 procedures per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 procedures per week. CONCLUSIONS A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities. A comprehensive plan can improve both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff.",

The local governments with a high number of cases or deaths in their regions were allowed to impose such restriction with approval from the Indonesian Ministry of Health. 7 The application of such measure included banning mass gathering, closing schools and offices, curbing non-essential business, and banning public transport. 7 Furthermore, the Indonesian Ministry of Health had selected several hospitals as the referral hospitals to handle the emerging infectious disease (KH.01.07/MENKES/169/2020).

The rapid test measures the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in patients' blood (i.e. IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2). For emergency patients, the rapid test can be directly ordered by the neurosurgeons without consulting the case to the COVID-19 team (i.e., the team that is assigned to provide specific management for the suspected COVID-19 patients). If a patient is tested positive by rapid test, one is then sent to undergo an RT-PCR test (i.e. the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19). 34",

Consequently, the number of working hours of staff and residents was also reduced.",

The program should contain continuous risk assessment of future threats, multi-hazards early warning system, and emergency simulations to prepare for an outbreak. 39 One example is the creation of clear hospital zoning. By treating different groups of patients in a separate zone, the risk of transmission can be reduced. 39 However, there is no exclusive zone dedicated to treating related patients in our hospital. All COVID-19-clinics and -wards are not located in the same zone. We also treated all surgical patients in the same building in Phase 2 because of limited screening resources. This could result in an increase in transmission if the prevailing procedure resulted in failure to detect positive cases. Furthermore, a good signage system can also be applied to promote physical distancing, hence reduced transmission rate.",

Our institution in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, has also been affected by the pandemic, especially in the early phase of the pandemic. Several factors such as the government's slow response, the inadequacy of proper PPE, and low testing rate hindered the management of neurosurgical patients during COVID-19. To help us understand the extent of such impact, we used a four-phase model of the outbreak. In Phase 2, where the first case was detected in Yogyakarta, there was a decline in the number of both emergency and elective surgical procedures. Moreover, the number of outpatients was also diminished. Using this model, we also expected to produce a clear strategy for a better management of neurosurgical patients during the pandemic. Several examples by reducing the number of surgical procedures and advocating the adequate supply of PPE to the stakeholder. In the future, a comprehensive plan can enhance both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff.",

However, we had limited knowledge of the disease at the time. As a result, there was no clear diagnosis, and inadequate equipment to manage it. Phase 2 was when the outbreak was detected for the first time in Yogyakarta until the government relax the strict regulation regarding the outbreak. Early in this phase, the number of cases outside Yogyakarta had soared, and the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the Indonesian Medical Association had released several measures as an effort to curb the impact. 22,23 Moreover, Phase 3, the transition phase, is trying to describe the phase where the infection rate has subsided, but the end of the outbreak has not been declared. Lastly, Phase 4 is defined as the period after the outbreak resolved. At the time of this writing, we have not yet entered the last two phases. The inclusion of those two phases is to explain our expectations of the end of the disease.",

Also, Burke et al 13 recommended a hospital to reduce the number of elective surgery by 25% if there is a total of 10-99 community cases or 7-16 COVID-19 inpatients in the hospital.
