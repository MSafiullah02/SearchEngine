Most healthcare facilities screen volunteers for active tuberculosis by Mantoux skin test and chest radiograph for those with positive reaction.

This is believed to be about 90% effective in preventing future reactivation of TB; but it does not prevent re-infection (with a new strain), which is a risk mainly in highly endemic countries. The main worrisome adverse effect of INH is clinical hepatitis, which can be fatal or lead to fulminant hepatitis that requires liver transplantation. There are two types of hepatic toxicity seen in INH; a common transient elevation of the transaminases seen in 10\u201330% of patients that occurs within 4\u20136 months and is benign and asymptomatic, and clinical hepatitis (symptomatic) which is much less common, age-related, and only occurs in about 1% of treated patients. Clinical hepatitis with INH is rare under 20 years of age and increases to about 2\u20132.3% above 50 years, and in persons >65 years, the risk increases to about 4.5%.1 About 50% of INH hepatitis occurs in the first few months of treatment and the remainder occurs later up to 12 months (if still on INH).7 The prognosis of overt INH hepatitis is usually very good if the drugs are discontinued promptly with the first sign of clinical hepatitis. The overall mortality is about 10% or 4.2 per 100,000 patients treated with INH.7 Middle-aged black women seem to have the worst prognosis from this complication. In the majority of patients, there is clinical and biochemical resolution of signs and laboratory abnormality within 1\u20132 months of stopping the drug. Occasionally, patients can present or develop a sub-acute, more protracted course that mimics chronic viral hepatitis and leads to cirrhosis.7\n",

There appears to be a higher risk and greater severity with higher doses, and higher incidence in slow acetylators.8, 9 Animal experiments show that INH metabolism leads to acetyl hydrazine, which after oxidation forms toxic intermediates. These are thought to produce damaging effects by acetylating or alkylating macromolecules within liver cells, but the exact mechanism of liver cell injury is unknown.7 In slow acetylators, acetyl hydrazine accumulates and predisposes to hepatotoxicity. Another metabolic pathway involves hydrolysis of INH to hydrazine and isonicotinic acid. Hydrazine is known to be directly hepatotoxic and hydrolysis of INH is increased by alcohol and rifampin.9 The mechanism of age-related hepatotoxicity is unclear, but could possibly be related to the slowing of acetylation with advancing age.",

Other considerations include temporal relationship with use of the medication, compatibility of clinical features and laboratory data, histopathology data and previous reports, and reproduction of the event by re-challenge with the putative agent.

Thus, there is a temporal relationship with diclofenac treatment and the onset of clinical hepatitis. NSAIDs in general are known, but rare causes of drug-induced hepatitis.7 The incidence of diclofenac-induced clinical hepatitis is about 1\u20135 per 100,000 users, and the incubation period varies from 3 to 12 weeks (consistent with the present case).7 Data from the diclofenac monograph (Novartis Pharmaceuticals) indicates that there is a higher incidence of moderate to severe (3\u20138 times upper limit of normal) and marked (>8 times normal) elevation of transaminases when compared to other NSAIDs. In addition, rare causes of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, and fulminant fatal hepatitis (or requiring liver transplant) have been reported with diclofenac. To date, there is no evidence of enhanced risk of clinical hepatitis in patients receiving both INH and diclofenac or other NSAIDs. Elderly women are more susceptible to NSAIDs-induced hepatitis. Histopathology of the liver usually reveals zone 3 or 5 spotty acute hepatocellular necrosis, but there can be granulomas, cholestasis, hepatic eosinophilia, and even chronic active hepatitis with overuse of NSAIDs.7 The prognosis is usually very good from withdrawal of NSAIDs.

Steroids were initially considered for SJS, but their value is unproven, controversial, and they are not routinely recommended. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is also very controversial, and although initial retrospective studies suggested benefit, recent prospective, non-randomized studies have not confirmed any definite value, and some studies showed increased renal failure and mortality with IVIG.21 In one of the largest studies from a single center, IVIG was assessed in a prospective non-comparative study of 34 patients with EN, and 20 subjects with TEN. There was no evidence of improvement in mortality, progression of detachment, nor re-epidermalization. Most deaths occurred in elderly patients with initially impaired renal function. Thus, IVIG is not recommended for EN unless being assessed in a randomized clinical trial. The death rate with IVIG was 32%, which was higher than the historical death rate in the same center (20%), in historical controls with TEN not treated with IVIG.22 Thus, IVIG may be harmful in patients with EN.",

Is it the responsibility of the physicians to explain all potential albeit rare adverse effects of any treatment? The courts may take in consideration the standard practice of the physician\u2019s peers, or what is considered accepted practice. Most physicians (if they do counsel patients on medications) would mention the most common side effects, but would not usually mention rare adverse effects. For instance, it would be justifiable to mention that a drug rash could be seen with TMP-SMX, if the patient happens to be allergic to the drug (which should be discontinued as soon as this occurs). As physicians, we would not usually mention that there is a rare risk of shedding of the skin, blindness, or death. Similarly, when prescribing penicillin in patients not known allergic to the drug, we generally do not counsel that there is a 1:50,000 to 1:300,000 risk of dying from anaphylaxis (which is treatable). Yet, if we were to order or prescribe chloramphenicol, it is expected that we should counsel the patient that there is a 1:50,000 to 1:300,000 risk of aplastic anemia, which is not treatable except by bone marrow transplantation. Hence, it may be asked; what is the best method of informing patients on medication toxicity? It is acceptable to leave this to pharmacists to provide literature on these drugs as the sole form of counseling. It is the prescriber\u2019s responsibility to obtain informed consent before ordering the medications.",

Thus, steroids can increase the risk and severity of a variety of infectious agents (virus, bacteria, fungi, and parasites). Most notable are agents that require intact cellular immunity for control and eradication, such as herpes viruses, mycobacteria, listeria, nocardia, pneumocystis, candida, cryptococci, toxoplasma, and strongyloides, etc., are increased in patients on prolonged corticosteroids.",

This dose is equivalent to 10 mg prednisone and normally would not be considered to be immunosuppressive. However, the course of the disease and widespread dissemination with fatality resembles that of an immunocompromised host. How can we explain this reaction? The possibilities include: (1) inaccurate history of the steroid dose provided by the patient, (2) rarely, dissemination and fatality can occur in healthy adults, (3) unrecognized immunocompromised state such as HIV infection or rare genetic mutations, or polymorphisms in genes involved in cellular immunity, and (4) higher free active concentration of the drug than would be expected. Methylprednisolone (Medrol) is 70% bound to protein, mainly albumin, and decrease in serum albumin by 30\u201350% could increase the active unbound drug almost to the same proportion. On admission to hospital, the patient\u2019s serum albumin was 15 g/L (lower limit of normal 35 g/L), 42% of the normal lower limit. Although the serum albumin can decrease in acute illness from varicella, the half-life of circulating albumin is 15 days and thus, even after 7 days of chickenpox, it should not decrease more than 25% below normal, even if his liver stopped producing any protein (which is not likely). Hence, the patient probably had a chronically low serum albumin from his chronic colitis. His free concentration of corticosteroid should have been greater than 50% of his expected active drug, which is equivalent to \u226515 mg prednisone/day.",

It is important for physicians to counsel their patients on these potential adverse events, and provide a risk-benefit assessment. Many organs and systems in the body can be adversely affected by chronic steroid therapy (endocrine, bone, eyes, muscle, brain, immune system, skin, etc.). It is important to counsel on potential increased risk of infectious diseases and certain precautions should be taken before embarking on chronic therapy. These include a Mantoux skin test and treatment for latent tuberculosis in those with positive reactions and about to receive prednisone \u226515 mg/day for \u226530 days.48 A baseline chest radiograph for active or inactive disease should be performed beforehand. It is also recommended that steroid dependent children should undergo VZV antibody test, and if this were negative, then varicella vaccination should be offered.33 It seems prudent to apply these guidelines to adults as well on chronic steroid therapy. For patients with previous chickenpox or adequate antibodies, varicella zoster vaccine may be considered to reduce the risk and severity of shingles. This vaccine, a live attenuated vaccine has been found effective and is recommended for persons \u226560 years of age to reduce the burden of illness and incidence of postherpetic neuralgia.49 Presently, this vaccine is not indicated in immunocompromised adults, so it should be administered before starting prolonged steroids. The product monograph of ZostavaxTM (Merck), states that the varicella zoster vaccine is contraindicated in patients receiving high-dose corticosteroid, but not contraindicated for individuals on inhaled or low-dose steroids. The varicella vaccine has been found safe in children with moderate immune deficiency,50 but it is contraindicated in those with substantial suppression of cellular immunity (as with high-dose steroid).51\n",
