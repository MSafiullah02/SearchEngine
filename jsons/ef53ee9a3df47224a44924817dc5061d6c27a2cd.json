This factorization is one of the most well-known and extensively studied in different contexts, from formal languages to algorithmic stringology and string compression. In particular the notion of a Lyndon word has been shown to be useful in theoretical applications, such as the well known proof of the Runs Theorem [2] as well as in string compression analysis. A connection between the Lyndon factorization and the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) factorization has been given in [18] , where it is shown that in general the size of the LZ factorization is larger than the size of the Lyndon factorization, and in any case the size of the Lyndon factorization cannot be larger than a factor of 2 with respect to the size of LZ. This result has been further extended in [28] to overlapping LZ factorizations. The Lyndon factorization has recently revealed to be a useful tool also in investigating queries related to suffixes of a word and sorting such suffixes [25] with strong potentialities [26] for string comparison that have not been completely explored and understood. Relations between Lyndon words and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) have been discovered first in [11, 23] and, more recently, in [19] . The main interest in such a factorization is also due to the fact that it can be efficiently computed. Linear-time algorithms for computing this factorization can be found in [15, 16] whereas an O(lg n)-time parallel algorithm has been proposed in [1, 13] .",

In [5] , the notion of an inverse Lyndon word (a word which is strictly greater than each of its proper suffixes) has been introduced to define new factorizations, called inverse Lyndon factorizations. An inverse Lyndon factorization has the property that a word is factorized in a sequence of inverse Lyndon words, in an increasing and prefix-order-free lexicographic ordering, where prefix-order-free means that a factor cannot be a prefix of the next one. A word w which is not an inverse Lyndon word may have several inverse Lyndon factorizations but it admits a canonical inverse Lyndon factorization. This special inverse Lyndon factorization has been introduced in [5] and denoted ICFL(w) because it is the counterpart of the Lyndon factorization CFL(w) of w, when we use (I)inverse words as factors. Indeed, in [5] it has been proved that ICFL(w) can be computed in linear time and it is uniquely determined for a word w.",

This result is proved by a further investigation on the connection between the Lyndon factorization and the canonical inverse Lyndon factorization of a word, given in [5] through the grouping property. Indeed, given a word w which is not an inverse Lyndon word, the factors in ICFL(w) are obtained by grouping together consecutive factors of the anti-Lyndon factorization of w that form a chain for the prefix order (Proposition 7.7 in [5] ).",

Different characterizations and variations of Lyndon words are given [3, 14, 21] . In the following L = L (\u03a3 * ,<) will be the set of Lyndon words, totally ordered by the relation \u227a on (\u03a3 * , <). We know that any word w \u2208 \u03a3 + can be written in a unique way as a nonincreasing product w = 1 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 h of Lyndon words, i.e., in the form w = 1 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 h , with j \u2208 L and 1 2 . . . h [9] . The sequence CFL(w) = ( 1 , . . . , h ) is called the Lyndon decomposition (or Lyndon factorization) of w. Uniqueness of the above factorization is proved in [15] and allows us to state a recursive definition of CFL(w), for a nonempty word w. Precisely, if w is not a Lyndon word, then CFL(w) = ( 1 , 1 , . . . , h ), where ( 1 , . . . , h ) = CFL(w ), w = 1 w and 1 is the longest prefix of w which is a Lyndon word. Sometimes we need to emphasize consecutive equal factors in CFL. We write CFL(w) = ( n1 1 , . . . , nr r ) to denote a tuple of n 1 +. . .+n r Lyndon words, where r > 0, n 1 , . . . , n r \u2265 1. Precisely 1 . . . r are Lyndon words, also named Lyndon factors of w. There is a linear time algorithm to compute the pair ( 1 , n 1 ) and thus, by iteration, the Lyndon factorization of w [16, 22] . Linear time algorithms may also be found in [15] and in the more recent paper [17] .",

Lemma 5 gives relations between the Lyndon factorizations of two overlapping words w, w , i.e., such that w = xy, w = yz, and the Lyndon factorization of the overlap y, when y is non-simple (as a suffix of w and as a prefix of w ). Indeed observe that both w and w are substrings of the same word xyz. As a consequence of Lemma 5, the words w, w may share common Lyndon factors between them and with xyz. Moreover, some of these factors may be in y. More precisely, let CFL(w) = ( 1 , . . . , k ) and CFL(w ) = (f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f h ). If y is a non-simple suffix of w and a non-simple prefix of w , then there are indexes i, j, with 1 \u2264 i < k, 1 < j \u2264 h, such that y = i i+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k = f 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 f j\u22121 f j , where i is a suffix of i and f j is a prefix of f j .

Since the Lyndon factorization can be computed in linear time, the above result could lead to efficient measures of similarities between words.

Our main result, Proposition 6, gives an upper bound on the length of the longest common prefix of two factors of a word and this upper bound has relationships with the factors in ICFL. This result could also be applied to investigate parallel approaches to sorting suffixes of a word w with a nontrivial inverse Lyndon factorization. Indeed, the above mentioned bound could relate sorting suffixes of w to sorting factors of w of bounded length. In addition, we state a property showing that substrings of the same word could share common factors of the Lyndon factorization (Lemma 5). This property could be extended to two words that share a common overlap to capture the suffix-prefix relationship between them. It is an open problem if Lemma 5 extends to ICFL(w). This extension, if it exists, may be of interest in the well known problem of efficient computation of the suffix-prefix relationship. This is an interesting problem in the analysis of sequencing data [7, 8] and in the construction of overlap graphs for a collection of strings. We believe that the above results could shed new light in further applications of the Lyndon and the inverse Lyndon factorization and this is the goal of our future research work.",
