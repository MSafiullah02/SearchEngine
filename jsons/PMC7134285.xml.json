In particular, the study aims to analyse the dimensional structure of the items presented in these scales in relation to prominent diagnostic criteria for substance dependence, models of behavioural addiction, and previous research in this regard, for four technologies frequently considered in the literature: the Internet, smartphones, video games, and social network sites (SNSs). Such a study will, firstly, aid in identifying shortcomings in existing scales, secondly, contribute a degree of conceptual clarity, thirdly, extend previous research focusing on only a single form of technology and, fourthly, provide a clearer foundation for improved assessment tools. To this end, building on the guidelines provided by Webster and Watson [18], a systematic review methodology was adopted to identify, collect, extract, and analyse a sample of such assessment tools.",

All duplicated results were noted and removed, after which, titles and abstracts were reviewed against the inclusion criteria. For all eligible studies, the relevant scale-items were extracted to be coded. Noting the alignment between the seven dimensions provided by Lortie and Guitton [16] and the diagnostic criteria described in the ICD-10 [20] and DSM-IV-TR [2], as well as the component model described by Griffiths [8], these seven dimensions were generalised to refer more broadly to all media and used as deductive, a priori categories for the analysis. Table 1 provides a summary of the dimensions used. The description provided represents a synthesis of Lortie and Guitton [16]\u2019s definitions, as well as their mapping of the dimensions to the diagnostic criteria in the ICD-10 [20] and DSM-IV-TR [2], the descriptions provided in the component model [8], and the updated criteria in the DSM-V [3]. Coding took place in three rounds and was performed by three independent coders. When a match was not possible, new dimensions were proposed. The process is described in Sect. 3.2.\n",

For all technology categories, while the absolute number of items and the specific questions posed differed, the overall dimensional structure was found to be particularly comparable. The prominence of compulsive use and negative outcomes supports Lortie and Guitton [16] who found a similar outcome when analysing 14 scales produced prior to 2012 only targeting Internet-related addiction. For compulsive use, a possible explanation, in both cases, rests on the inclusion of tolerance, considered by some to be a separate dimension, in its description. Nevertheless, given the imbalance in dimensions considered, future studies need to consider, firstly, how representative these scales are of the supposed dimensions of technology-related behavioural addictions and, secondly, whether under-representation of particular dimensions is a valid concern. Furthermore, researchers intending to use an existing scale should, in addition to considering the scale description, account for the dimensional structure of items when determining the fit between a scale and their research questions.",

First, while the search string was designed to enable the collection of a comprehensive sample, there remains the possibility that relevant scales could have been inadvertently omitted. Furthermore, while four distinct technology categories were used, it is acknowledged that, in many cases it is not possible to distinguish between them. For instance, many uses of a smartphone involve engagement with the Internet or various SNSs. This is especially the case for scales targeting Internet-related behaviours. While an imperfect solution, scales were allocated to a category on the basis of their titles and original descriptions. Finally, while the a priori dimensions used were based on related previous research [16], it is acknowledged that, although general characteristics of behavioural addictions are likely to exist [8], dimensions pertinent to one domain might not be well-suited to other domains (e.g., Internet vs. gaming-related behaviour). Similarly, in using Lortie and Guitton [16]\u2019s dimensions the \u2018tolerance\u2019 dimension from the component model [8] was not included as an explicit dimension itself.

Lortie and Guitton [16, p. 108] note that the dimensional structure of an assessment questionnaire is inherently linked to the researchers\u2019 conception of the phenomenon of interest. Consequently, the findings of the study provide a lens through which to interpret current conceptions of purportedly pathological interactions with technology. Overwhelmingly, a majority of scale-items concern compulsive use, negative outcomes associated with use and, to a lesser extent, withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, whether intentional or not, these dimensions are seen by researchers to be central to various conceptions of problematic use. Building on this study, efforts should be made to establish conceptual clarity about what constitutes problematic or addictive technology interactions and, on this basis, curb the development of novel scales, consolidate existing items, and conduct more extensive validations of current scales. Only with more sophisticated and theoretically-sound measurement tools will we be able to produce the empirical evidence necessary for truly understanding the existence and possible nature of problematic engagements with various digital technologies.",
