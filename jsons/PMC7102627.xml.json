SARS emerged in 2002 in Guangdong province, China, and its subsequent global spread was associated with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths (de Wit et al., 2016, WHO, 2004). Chinese horseshoe bats serve as natural reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005a). Human transmission was facilitated by intermediate hosts like civet cats and raccoon dogs, which are frequently sold as food sources in Chinese wet markets (Guan et al., 2003). At present, no specific antivirals or approved vaccines are available to combat SARS, and the SARS pandemic in 2002 and 2003 was finally stopped by conventional control measures, including travel restrictions and patient isolation.",

An initial cluster of infections was linked to Huanan seafood market, potentially due to animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred (Chan et al., 2020) and the disease, now termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread within China. A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV, was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the new lung disease (Zhu et al., 2020). On February 12, 2020, a total of 44,730 laboratory-confirmed infections were reported in China, including 8,204 severe cases and 1,114 deaths (WHO, 2020). Infections were also detected in 24 countries outside China and were associated with international travel. At present, it is unknown whether the sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV translate into similar biological properties, including pandemic potential (Munster et al., 2020).",

Entry depends on binding of the surface unit, S1, of the S protein to a cellular receptor, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells. In addition, entry requires S protein priming by cellular proteases, which entails S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2\u2019 site and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes, a process driven by the S2 subunit (Figure 1\nA). SARS-S engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor (Li et al., 2003) and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (Glowacka et al., 2011, Matsuyama et al., 2010, Shulla et al., 2011). The SARS-S/ACE2 interface has been elucidated at the atomic level, and the efficiency of ACE2 usage was found to be a key determinant of SARS-CoV transmissibility (Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005b). SARS-S und SARS-2-S share \u223c76% amino acid identity. However, it is unknown whether SARS-2-S like SARS-S employs ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for host cell entry.",

            "text": "The goal of our study was to obtain insights into how SARS-2-S facilitates viral entry into target cells and how this process can be blocked. For this, we first asked whether SARS-2-S is robustly expressed in a human cell line, 293T, commonly used for experimentation because of its high transfectability. Moreover, we analyzed whether there is evidence for proteolytic processing of the S protein because certain coronavirus S proteins are cleaved by host cell proteases at the S1/S2 cleavage site in infected cells (Figure 1A). Immunoblot analysis of 293T cells expressing SARS-2-S protein with a C-terminal antigenic tag revealed a band with a molecular weight expected for unprocessed S protein (S0) (Figure 1B). A band with a size expected for the S2 subunit of the S protein was also observed in cells and, more prominently, in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing SARS-2-S (Figure 1B). In contrast, an S2 signal was largely absent in cells and particles expressing SARS-S (Figure 1B), as previously documented (Glowacka et al., 2011, Hofmann et al., 2004b). These results suggest efficient proteolytic processing of SARS-2-S in human cells, in keeping with the presence of several arginine residues at the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-2-S but not SARS-S (Figure 1A). In contrast, the S2\u2032 cleavage site of SARS-2-S was similar to that of SARS-S.",

We employed VSV pseudotypes bearing SARS-2-S to study cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Both SARS-2-S and SARS-S were robustly incorporated into VSV particles (Figure 1B), allowing a meaningful side-by-side comparison; although, formally, comparable particle incorporation of the S1 subunit remains to be demonstrated. We first asked which cell lines were susceptible to SARS-2-S-driven entry, using a panel of well-characterized cell lines of human and animal origin, respectively. All cell lines were readily susceptible to entry driven by the glycoprotein of the pantropic VSV (VSV-G) (Figure 1C; Figure S1\n), as expected. Most human cell lines and the animal cell lines Vero and MDCKII were also susceptible to entry driven by SARS-S (Figure 1C). Moreover, SARS-2-S facilitated entry into an identical spectrum of cell lines as SARS-S (Figure 1C), suggesting similarities in choice of entry receptors.",

Sequence analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 clusters with SARS-CoV-related viruses from bats (SARSr-CoV), of which some but not all can use ACE2 for host cell entry (Figure 2\nA; Figure S2\n). Analysis of the receptor binding motif (RBM), a portion of the receptor binding domain (RBD) that makes contact with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005a), revealed that most amino acid residues essential for ACE2 binding by SARS-S were conserved in SARS-2-S (Figure 2B). In contrast, most of these residues were absent from S proteins of SARSr-CoV previously found not to use ACE2 for entry (Figure 2B) (Ge et al., 2013, Hoffmann et al., 2013, Menachery et al., 2020). In agreement with these findings, directed expression of human and bat (Rhinolophus alcyone) ACE2 but not human DPP4, the entry receptor used by MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 2013), or human APN, the entry receptor used by HCoV-229E (Yeager et al., 1992), allowed SARS-2-S- and SARS-S-driven entry into otherwise non-susceptible BHK-21 cells (Figure 3\nA). Moreover, antiserum raised against human ACE2 blocked SARS-S- and SARS-2-S- but not VSV-G- or MERS-S-driven entry (Figure 3B). Finally, authentic SARS-CoV-2 infected BHK-21 cells transfected to express ACE2 cells but not parental BHK-21 cells with high efficiency (Figure 3C), indicating that SARS-2-S, like SARS-S, uses ACE2 for cellular entry.",

Ammonium chloride blocked VSV-G-dependent entry into both cell lines whereas entry driven by Nipah virus F and G proteins was not affected (Figure S3\nA; data not shown), consistent with Nipah virus but not VSV being able to fuse directly with the plasma membrane (Bossart et al., 2002). Ammonium chloride treatment strongly inhibited SARS-2-S- and SARS-S-driven entry into TMPRSS2\u2212 293T cells (Figure S3 A), suggesting CatB/L dependence. Inhibition of entry into TMPRSS2+ Caco-2 cells was less efficient compared to 293T cells (Figure S3 A), which would be compatible with SARS-2-S priming by TMPRSS2 in Caco-2 cells. Indeed, the clinically proven serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which is active against TMPRSS2 (Kawase et al., 2012), partially blocked SARS-2-S-driven entry into Caco-2 (Figure S3 B) and Vero-TMPRSS2 cells (Figure 4\nA). Full inhibition was attained when camostat mesylate and E-64d, an inhibitor of CatB/L, were added (Figure 4A; Figure S3B), indicating that SARS-2-S can use both CatB/L as well as TMPRSS2 for priming in these cell lines. In contrast, camostat mesylate did not interfere with SARS-2-S-driven entry into the TMPRSS2\u2212 cell lines 293T (Figure S3B) and Vero (Figure 4A), which was efficiently blocked by E-64d and therefore is CatB/L dependent. Moreover, directed expression of TMPRSS2 rescued SARS-2-S-driven entry from inhibition by E-64d (Figure 4B), confirming that SARS-2-S can employ TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.",

In addition, these sera also reduced SARS-2-S-driven entry, although with lower efficiency compared to SARS-S (Figure 5). Similarly, rabbit sera raised against the S1 subunit of SARS-S reduced both SARS-S- and SARS-2-S-driven entry with high efficiency, and again inhibition of SARS-S-driven entry was more efficient.

In the lung, SARS-CoV infects mainly pneumocytes and macrophages (Shieh et al., 2005). However, ACE2 expression is not limited to the lung, and extrapulmonary spread of SARS-CoV in ACE2+ tissues was observed (Ding et al., 2004, Gu et al., 2005, Hamming et al., 2004). The same can be expected for SARS-CoV-2, although affinity of SARS-S and SARS-2-S for ACE2 remains to be compared. It has been suggested that the modest ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory tract (Bertram et al., 2012, Hamming et al., 2004) might limit SARS-CoV transmissibility. In light of the potentially increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV, one may speculate that the new virus might exploit cellular attachment-promoting factors with higher efficiency than SARS-CoV to ensure robust infection of ACE2+ cells in the upper respiratory tract. This could comprise binding to cellular glycans, a function ascribed to the S1 domain of certain coronaviruses (Li et al., 2017, Park et al., 2019). Finally, it should be noted that ACE2 expression protects from lung injury and is downregulated by SARS-S (Haga et al., 2008, Imai et al., 2005, Kuba et al., 2005), which might promote SARS. It will thus be interesting to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 also interferes with ACE2 expression.",

Indeed, SARS-2-S was efficiently cleaved in cells, and cleaved S protein was incorporated into VSV particles. Notably, the cleavage site sequence can determine the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses (Menachery et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2015), and a multibasic cleavage site was not present in RaTG13, the coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

            "text": "The S proteins of SARS-CoV can use the endosomal cysteine proteases CatB/L for S protein priming in TMPRSS2\u2212 cells (Simmons et al., 2005). However, S protein priming by TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L is essential for viral entry into primary target cells and for viral spread in the infected host (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019, Kawase et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2015). The present study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 spread also depends on TMPRSS2 activity, although we note that SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells was inhibited but not abrogated by camostat mesylate, likely reflecting residual S protein priming by CatB/L. One can speculate that furin-mediated precleavage at the S1/S2 site in infected cells might promote subsequent TMPRSS2-dependent entry into target cells, as reported for MERS-CoV (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018, Park et al., 2016). Collectively, our present findings and previous work highlight TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor that is critical for spread of several clinically relevant viruses, including influenza A viruses and coronaviruses (Gierer et al., 2013, Glowacka et al., 2011, Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019, Kawase et al., 2012, Matsuyama et al., 2010, Shulla et al., 2011, Zhou et al., 2015). In contrast, TMPRSS2 is dispensable for development and homeostasis (Kim et al., 2006) and thus constitutes an attractive drug target. In this context, it is noteworthy that the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which blocks TMPRSS2 activity (Kawase et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2015), has been approved in Japan for human use, but for an unrelated indication. This compound or related ones with potentially increased antiviral activity (Yamamoto et al., 2016) could thus be considered for off-label treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",

CSS-3 and CSS-4 originated from a second SARS patient 24 and 36 days post onset of disease. CSS-5 was collected from a third SARS patient 10 days post onset of disease. Rabbit sera were obtained by immunizing rabbits with purified SARS-S1 protein fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin.",
