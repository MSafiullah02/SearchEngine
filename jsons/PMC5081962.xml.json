The remaining 98 % of RNA transcripts are collectively known as non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) which may be divided into small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) or long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [1, 2]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression in almost all metazoans [3]. In spite of coding for any proteins, miRNAs carry different information and execute different functions [4]. They regulate gene expression either by complete cleavage or by translational repression of the target mRNAs [3, 5, 6] It has been speculated that approximately 30\u201360 % of the human coding genome is regulated by thousands of miRNAs with diverse targets [7, 8].",

            "text": "The exciting avenue of miRNA was unraveled in 1993 by the finding that Lin-4, a heterochronic gene previously recognized for its role in regulating the temporal sequence of events involved in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) larval development to adult form, regulates the process by synthesizing a pair of small RNAs rather than coding for a protein [9]. Two small Lin-4 RNA transcripts containing complementary sequences to a repeating sequence element within the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) of another mRNA (Lin-14) were identified in C. elegans [10]. The finding led to the prediction of a type of RNA-RNA binding and interaction which down-regulates the translation of the target mRNA [4]. Subsequently, the second miRNA (Let-7) with a similar function in the late development of larva was discovered in the same organism [11]. The names for miRNAs are assigned by using the prefix \u201cmiR\u201d preceding a unique identification numeric (e.g., miR-1, miR-2 etc.). To make species specific, few letters from the name of the organism are added before miR (e.g.; hsa for Homo sapiens, mmu for mus musculus, rno from Rattus norvegicus, ath for Arabidopsis plant etc.) [12]. The genes coding for miRNAs are named by capitalization (e.g., MIR-), hyphenation and italicization (e.g., mir-) in accordance with the conventions for the particular organism [12, 13]. Currently, 35,828 total and 2588 human encoded mature miRNAs are registered in miRNA database (http://www.mirbase.org/) [14, 15].",

            "text": "Genes encoding several identical or similar miRNAs are generally located as a cluster in the genome, where they might be expressed simultaneously [16] or individually depending on the tissue types [17]. In mammals, RNA polymerase II transcribes the gene into a long transcript known as a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) consisting of single or multiple hairpin structures (Fig. 1) [13, 18\u201321]. Pri-miRNA is trimmed into an approximately 70 nucleotide long hairpin structure known as pre-miRNA by Drosha complex [22, 23]. The resulting pre-miRNA with a 5\u2032 phosphate overhang and a 2 nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang is recognized by exportin-5 [24] and is transported out of the nucleus [18, 25, 26]. Once released in the cytoplasm, a specialized multi-domain ribonuclease III enzyme known as Dicer excises the pre-miRNA to remove the loop structure leaving the remaining miRNA duplex with a 2 nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang [18, 27, 28]. Some functional miRNA such as miRtrons and Simtrons do not undergo the canonical process for their maturations [29, 30]. In miRtron biogenesis, Drosha cleavage is substituted by splicing of intronic hairpin structures, which is followed by maturation through dicing [31]. Simtron is synthesized by a pathway that involves only Drosha but does not require DGCR8, Dicer, Ago2 or XPO5 for its further processing [32]. After Dicer cleavage and unwinding of the two strands of miR-miR duplex, one strand (anti-sense strand) of the resulting miRNA-miRNA duplex is loaded onto Argonaute proteins and miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) is generated [3, 33].\n",

However, miRNAs can also target to the sites other than 3\u2032UTR, such as 5\u2032UTR and the coding regions of mRNA and lead to translational repression [35, 36]. In mammal, perfect complimentary affects the stability and triggers tailing and 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 trimming of miRNA [37]. It has been reported that some miRNAs can also mediate up-regulation of genes and that the genetic down-regulation mediated by miRNA can be reversible [38]. The upregulating miRNAs most likely direct the association of regulatory proteins complexes (Argonaute protein and fragile X mental retardation-related protein 1 (FXR1)) with AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3\u2032UTR of the mRNA, leading to activation of AREs as a translation signal [39]. Moreover, interaction of miRNA at 5\u2032UTR can also trigger activation of translation [35].",

            "text": "Considerable evidences suggesting the role of miRNAs in modulating Hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle, infectivity and host defense mechanisms have opened a novel avenue for innovative therapeutic approaches for HCV infection. miR-122, which is abundantly expressed in liver cells, interacts with HCV genomic RNA and facilitates its replication in infected cells [45, 53]. The interaction is mediated through binding of two copies of miR-122 to their respective seed map sites located within the 5\u2032 UTR of the HCV genome [43, 45] The stable heterotrimeric interaction enhances HCV translation by promoting its association with ribosomes during the early initiation stage of translation [43]. Furthermore, miR-122 associated Argonaute proteins attached to the 5\u2032 end of HCV genomic RNA protects the RNA from 5\u2032 exonuclease activity, specifically of the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exoribonuclease 1 (Xrn1) [54, 55]. Interestingly, miR-122 interaction with the 5\u2032 UTR of HCV RNA produces a 3\u2032 overhang and masks the 5\u2032 UTR, circumventing recognition by RNA helicase and ultimately reducing RNA decay [56]. Thus, miR-122 has a crucial role in enhancing HCV replication either by 5\u2032 UTR masking or other mechanisms [57]. Targeting miR-122 could be a novel approach for developing a therapy against chronic HCV infections and the miRNA can be employed as a biomarker of hepatic damage by the virus. The most promising example for miRNA based therapeutic approach is miravirsen, an oligonucleotide which has been demonstrated to inhibit the function of miR-122 [43].",

Let-7b, expressed in various tissues including liver and spleen, binds to the HCV RNA genome at various positions including the 5\u2032 UTR and NS5B coding region leading to repression of HCV replication, possibly inducing conformational changes in the viral RNA genome [59]. miR-196 and miR-448 are also capable of directly binding to and interacting with the HCV RNA genome and exerting inhibitory effects on HCV replication [60]. Recently, miR-181c was reported to bind to the E1 and NS5A regions of the HCV genome and have a down-regulating role in viral replication (Fig. 2) [8].

Interestingly, HCV infection up-regulates miR-21 and miR-130a expression, both of which negatively regulate their target genes known to trigger viral replication in cells, by decreasing HCV-mediated IFN type I (IFN-I) production and disrupting the process of viral entry, respectively [61, 62].

Over-expression of miR-155 may inhibit apoptosis of hepatocytes and promote cell proliferation by activating Wnt signaling leading to progression to hepatocellular carcinoma [65, 66]. Conversely, the suppression of miR-155 may lead to cell cycle arrest in the G0 or G1 phase suggesting the positive role of miR-155 in immune defense against HCV infection [65]. Therefore, balanced expression of miR-155 is essential to retard the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and at the same time promote adequate cell cycle.",

Activation of resting CD4+ T-cells (which results in more HIV replication) leads to down-regulation of these miRNAs, which can be correlated with enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [73]. Other miRNAs target host factors and indirectly modulate HIV-1 replication, susceptibility and latency in different cells (Table 1). miR-27b has been reported to inhibit the expression of Cyclin T1 in resting CD4+ T-cells. Activation of CD4+ T-cells has been shown to down-regulate miR-27b, subsequently up-regulating Cyclin T1. Up-regulation of Cyclin T1 results in enhanced HIV-1 susceptibility of CD4+ T-cells [77].

Over-expression of miR-132 down-regulates methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) leading to enhancement of HIV-1 infection [76]. In addition, miR-217 and miR-34a, which have been reported to be up-regulated by tat exposure, bind to the 3\u2032 UTR of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) mRNA inhibiting its expression. Inhibition of SIRT1 which de-acetylates tat protein and regulates HIV-1 transcription, enhances HIV-1 tat-mediated transactivation [83, 84]. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that down-regulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) by miR-182 led to decreased SIRT1 expression levels, which in turn enhanced HIV-1 Tat trans-activation [30, 72]. HIV-1 induces the expression of miR-34a, which promotes HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells. The other target of miR-34a is phosphatase 1 nuclear-targeting subunit (PNUTS), which negatively regulates HIV-1 transcription by inhibiting the assembly of cyclin T1 and CDK9 to block the transcription elongation [85].",

            "text": "A group of researchers has reported that Dengue virus (DENV) infection down regulates host cellular miRNA elements, notably Dicer, Drosha, Ago1 and Ago2, to facilitate its replication. They found that the downregulation was mediated by interferon independent activity of the viral protein NS4B which interferes the dicing of precursor miRNA [86]. DENV infection significantly induces the expression of miR-146a, which facilitates viral replication by targeting TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) and dampening Interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) production [87]. All four subtypes of DENV downregulate the miRNA-133a which suppresses viral replication possibly via interference with polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) expression [88]. Yet, another miRNA namely miR-548g-3p also regulates the replication of DENV by targeting stem loop A (SLA) promoter element within the 5\u2032UTR of DENV genome [89]. miRNA expression profiling followed by qRT-PCR validation has revealed that 4 miRNAs were upregulated and 2 were downregulated in dengue patients. miR-21-5p and miR-146a-5p, which were functionally involved in inflammation and cell proliferation, were significantly different from the control groups indicating their high sensitivity and specificity as indicators of dengue infection. Further, these two miRNAs were correlated with number of leucocytes and neutrophils. These findings have suggested that miRNAs can also be employed as a diagnostic marker for DENV infection [90]. On the other hand, small viral RNA resembling miRNA found in mosquitos infected with DENV type 2 is reported to specifically target a viral gene and auto-regulates viral replication [91]. Incorporation of the miRNA recognition element (MRE) of miR-122 into the viral mRNA might have inhibitory effect on susceptibility to DENV infection in hepatic cells, rendering the virus safer for vaccine preparation [92].",

The principal target for the latency-inducing miRNAs (e.g. miR-138) is the infected cell polypeptide 0 protein (ICP0), which induces lytic genes in neuron [93]. Similarly, host cell miR-155, miR-146a and miR-21 are up-regulated in B-cells when latently infected by Epstein Bar Virus (EBV) [94]. miR-155 mediated attenuation of NF-\u03baB signaling in B lymphocytes by EBV is pivotal for the stable maintenance of EBV genome and immortalization of B lymphocytes during latency [95]. Conversely, EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) upregulates miR-155 expression by activation of NF-kB pathway [96]. So, the complex interaction among miR-155, LMP1 and NF-kB signaling seems to control the immortalization and latency in EBV infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been reported to repress the expression of miR-100 and miR-101, which are linked to apoptosis [97]. Some oncogenic herpesviruses encode viral miRNA that mimic and exploit miR-155-mediated regulatory pathways for their own benefit. Kshv-miR-K12-11, the viral functional ortholog of miR-155 encoded by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), mimics miR-155 and utilizes its regulatory pathway to immortalize infected lymphocytes. KSHV-miR-12-11 attenuates TGF-\u03b2 via downregulation of SMAD5 [98]. The other miR-155 functional ortholog, miR-M4 encoded by Marek\u2019s disease chicken virus (MDV), may also be responsible for contributing to viral oncogenicity by down-regulating its target latent TGF-\u03b2-binding protein-1 (LTBP1), leading to reduced secretion of TGF-\u03b21. The resulting suppression of TGF-\u03b2 signaling might contribute to the activation of the oncogene c-Myc [65].",

Extensive research has been carried out in plant and insect VSRs, but only a few of them from mammalian viruses have been identified [99]. Some of the examples for mammalian VSRs are nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of Corona viruses, VP35 protein from Ebola virus, tat protein of HIV, Core protein (C) of HCV, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) from Human influenza virus and B2 protein of Nodamura virus [100\u2013104]. N protein of Corona viruses, via its double-stranded RNA binding activity, suppresses the short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or siRNAs from mammalian cells [100]. Similarly, VP35 protein from Ebola virus, which is an antagonist of IFN, suppresses RNAi interference by binding to dsRNA in human cells [101]. Whereas, HIV-1 tat and HCV core protein counteract the RNAi in human cell lines by downregulating the expression or activity of Dicer, which processes precursor hairpin structures [102, 103]. Function of tat as a suppressor of RNAi by suppressing the common pathway in small RNA maturation is conserved across plants as well as animals including human [105]. A novel viral motif, arginine rich motif (ARM) in the HIV-1 tat and rev has been shown to counteract the RNA interference mediated by Dicer [106].",

            "text": "Many of the miRNA such as miR-9, miR-34, miR-137, miR-148, miR-124; are found to be controlled by epigenetic mechanism like DNA methylation and histone acetylation [110]. Conversely, some of the miRNAs modulate the epigenetics by controlling the epigenetic regulators such as methyl transferase, histone deacetylases and polycomb group genes [111]. Epigenetic changes of miRNA or tumor suppressor genes can be induced by pathogenic microorganism, leading to carcinogenesis. Aberrant methylation of miRNA genes (hsa-miR-124) in cervical cancer cell line caused by Human papilloma virus (HPV) has also been reported [112, 113]. On the other hand, Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoal parasite, hijacks the histone deacetylase and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to suppress two host miRNA namely miR-424 and miR-503 in the epithelial cells [111]. Two of the miRNA namely miR-1 and miR-152 are reported to be involved in HBV pathogenesis via epigenetic control [114, 115]. miR-1 upregulates HBV transcription by enhancing farnesoid X receptor \u03b1 expression but downregulates host cell cycle and cell proliferation by targeting histone deacetylase 4 and E2F transcription factor 5 [114]. Whereas, miR-152 reduces the levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in HBV induced Hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting 3\u2032UTR of DNMT1 [115].",

Many viruses are able to modulate cellular miRNA expression in host cells mostly in order to facilitate their survival, replication and pathogenesis. But, the overexpression of miRNA triggered by pathogens is not always correlated with their survival or pathogenesis and is sometimes cell or tissue specific. The exact mechanism(s) of modulation of host cellular miRNA by viruses and specific virulence factors is still unclear. Unraveling the molecular mechanism(s) of miRNA modulation by viral infections and vice versa will give direction to novel therapeutic approaches. Manipulation of miRNA, either by miRNA analogs or by inhibitors, could be a novel approach for developing therapies and prophylactic vaccines for various life-threatening viral infections. In addition, miRNAs may be exploited as biomarkers for laboratory diagnosis and prognosis. Some of the important cellular miRNA implicated in some viral infections are summarized in Table 1.",

Subsequently, Exportin-5 binds to the pre-miRNA and to a GTP-Ran, forming a heterotrimeric complex which passes through the nuclear membrane. After translocation to the cytoplasm, the GTPase activity of Ran catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP into GDP to facilitate the release of pre-miRNA from exportin-5. Exportin-5 then returns to the nucleus and available for another round of pre-miRNA transport. Once released in the cytoplasm, a specialized multi-domain ribonuclease III enzyme known as Dicer further processes the pre-miRNAs to form a miRNA-miRNA duplex. One strand (anti-sense strand) of the resulting miRNA-miRNA duplex is loaded onto Argonaute proteins leading to the formation of miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Partial complementary base pairing occurs between the seed region (2 to 8 nucleotides from the 5\u2032-proximal region) of the miRNA and the seed map site (complementary to the seed region) of the target mRNA. The ultimate effect may be either endo-nucleolytic cleavage or translational repression of the target mRNA",
