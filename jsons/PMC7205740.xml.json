The mathematical modeling tactic is one of the main tools in order to handle these challenges. Many disease models have been evolved in the existing literature which authorizes us to explore and dominance the prevalence of infectious diseases in a better style. Most of these models rely on classical differential equations. However, in the past few years, it is paying attention that fractional differential equations can be applied to model global phenomena with a greater grade of precision and its applications can be found in various fields for instance dynamic, biology, engineering, control theory, economics, finance and in epidemiology.",

Various types of fractional order or nonlocal derivatives were proposed in the present literature to transact the reduction of a traditional derivative. For instance, based on power-law, Riemann-Liouville introduced the idea of fractional derivative. After that Caputo-Fabrizio in [7] have proposed a new fractional derivative utilizing the exponential kernel. This derivative has a few troubles related to the locality of the kernel. Newly, to overcome Caputo-Fabrizio\u2019s problem, Atangana and Baleanu (AB) in [8] have proposed a new modified version of a fractional derivative with the aid of popularized Mittag-Leffler function (MLF) as nonsingular kernel and nonlocal. Since the generalized MLF is used as the kernel and it\u2019s guaranteed no singularity, the AB fractional derivative supply a stellar description of memory [9], [10], [11].",

For example, T. Chen, et al., in [12] presented a big mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus. A. Hussain et al., in [13] showed the existence and uniqueness of results for the fractional model involving fractional derivative in Atangana-Baleanu sense using Schaefer\u2019s and Banach\u2019s fixed point theorems. Moreover, they applied the Shehu transform and Picard method to explore the iterative solutions and its stability for the proposed fractional model. A conceptual model for the COVID-19 disease, which effectively catches the time line of this virus outbreak was proposed by Lin et. al. in [14]. In [16] A mathematical modeling and dynamics of a novel (2019-nCoV) are formulated under a fractional model with considering the available infection cases within 7 days. A mathematical model considered by Shaikh, et al. [15] to study estimate of the effectiveness of prophylactic measures, prophesying future outbreaks and possibility control strategies of COVID-19.",

The numerical solution and numerical simulations of the model at hand are presented in Section 5. For the numerical simulation, we use a powerful two step numerical tool called fractional AB method. The concerned numerical method is more powerful than usual Euler method as well Taylor method. Because the mentioned method is faster convergent and stable as compared to Taylor and Euler method which are slowly convergent. For detail about this method, see [32], [33], [34], [35].",

Then the model\n(1)\n-\n(2)\nwill be U-H stable in \u03dd.\n\nProofLet \u03a8\u02dc\u2208\u03dd be the solution of the inequality (13-a) and the function \u03a8 \u2208 \u03dd is a unique solution of equation (1-a) with the condition(16)\u03a8(0)=\u03a8\u02dc(0).That is(17)\u03a8(t)=\u03a80+1\u2212\u221dN(\u221d)H(t,\u03a8(t))+\u221dN(\u221d)1\u0393(\u221d)\u222b0t(t\u2212\u03b6)\u221d\u22121H(\u03b6,\u03a8(\u03b6))d\u03b6Due to (16), \u03a80=\u03a80\u02dc, the equation (17) becomes\u03a8(t)=\u03a80\u02dc+1\u2212\u221dN(\u221d)H(t,\u03a8(t))+\u221dN(\u221d)1\u0393(\u221d)\u222b0t(t\u2212\u03b6)\u221d\u22121H(\u03b6,\u03a8(\u03b6))d\u03b6.\nThus by Hypothesis 1 and Lemma 4.1.1, we obtain|\u03a8\u02dc(t)\u2212\u03a8(t)|\u2264|\u03a8\u02dc(t)\u2212\u03a8\u02dcg(t)|+|\u03a8\u02dcg(t)\u2212\u03a8(t)|\u2264\u03ba\u03f5+1\u2212\u221dN(\u221d)|H(t,\u03a8\u02dc(t))\u2212H(t,\u03a8(t))|+\u221dN(\u221d)1\u0393(\u221d)\u222b0t(t\u2212\u03b6)\u221d\u22121|H(t,\u03a8\u02dc(t))\u2212H(t,\u03a8(t))|d\u03b6+\u03ba\u03f5\u22642\u03ba\u03f5+(1\u2212\u221dN(\u221d)+T\u221dN(\u221d)\u0393(\u221d))LH\u2225\u03a8\u02dc\u2212\u03a8\u2225.which implies\u2225\u03a8\u02dc\u2212\u03a8\u2225\u22642\u03ba\u03f51\u2212\u03983,Due to \u03983 < 1. For \u03bb=2\u03ba1\u2212\u03983, we get \u2225\u03a8\u02dc\u2212\u03a8\u2225\u2264\u03bb\u03f5.\nHence the model (1)-(2) is U-H stable. \u25a1\n",

The growth and decay of various compartment is different that some compartments are growing with different rate due to fractional order and similar behavior may be observed for decay of some compartments. Lower the order faster is the growing rate and vice versa and similarly the decay also is different at different fractional order. Therefore fractional calculus can help in understanding the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus-19 disease. Also the concerned numerical scheme can be used as a powerful tools to perform numerical simulation of such complicated model. In Figure 1 as susceptible papulation is decreasing as they are exposing so the density of expose class is going on growing as in Figure 2. On the other hand the infected bats density is increasing as presented in Figure 3, while the number of removed bats are also increasing in Figure 4 until stable in the market. On the other hand as the density of susceptible host is decreasing in Figure 5 because they are exposing to infection. Therefore the density of exposed host is growing as in Figure 6 as a results the host catching more infecting and hence the density of host infected is also increasing. This process may be observed from Figure 7. As a results of infection the removed (either death or get ride from infection) will increasing as in Figure 8. In same way the density of susceptible people is decreasing in Figure 9 because they are exposing to infection so the density of exposed people will decrease (see Figure 10), because the people rapidly catching infection, hence the density of symptomatic infected people will grow as in Figure 11. The similar behavior one can observed for density of asymptomatic and removed (either death or recovered from infection) in Figure 12 and 13 respectively. Since as the density of infected bats is increasing, also the infection in host papulation is growing. As a result the papulation of virus in reservoir will grow further as presented in Figure 14.",

The existence and uniqueness of the considered model has been guaranteed by applying Krasnoselskii and Banach fixed point theorems. Also some stability results of Ulam type have been constructed. With the help of fractional Adams Bashforth method method we have simulated the results corresponding to various fractional orders. The obtained results play important role in developing the theory of fractional analytical dynamic for the current pandemic due to Coronavirus -19 which has badly affected the whole world. From the simulation we noted that the decrease in susceptibility is faster at lower fractional order of the derivative and in same line the increase in infections is also rapid with smaller order. The presented results may be helpful in understanding the present pandemic more comprehensively and can help in taking precautionary measure to reduce the infection to minimum.",
