            "text": "From the late 1970s, when first the US domestic cargo market was liberalized followed by the domestic passenger sector, there has been a gradual withdraw of the state from the specific economic regulation of airlines. Internationally, the initial moves at deregulation can be traced to the initiation of the US's \u201cOpen Skies\u201d policy from 1979. The recent opening up, at least to a substantial extent, of the US\u2013EU1\ntransatlantic market is the one of the most significant measures of international airline liberalization since the removal of international market barriers within the European Union (EU). The US\u2013EU passenger market is substantial. In 2007 it accounted for 55 million passengers, 385 flights per day in each direction and 235 nonstop city-pairs served by 45 airlines comprising eight from the US, 26 from the EU and 11 others. Geographically, 32 airports in 23 states were served on the US side and 53 airports in 19 countries in the EU.",

The Chicago Convention of 1944 laid down a basis upon which a system of international bilateral air service agreements (ASAs) was founded.2\nThis was a compromise arrangement that attempted to reconcile the very liberal, free market ideas of the US on the one hand and the more restrictive ones of countries such as Australia (that wanted a single global carrier) on the other. There were particular fears in some countries that the US, that had the largest fleet of commercial aircraft at the time and the potential of adding to this by converting surplus military hardware, would dominate any largely market-based outcome and thus an institutional structure emerged that led to piecemeal, and restrictive, practical arrangements.",

Because of this, they probably did little to impede the development of the sector for some time. Additionally, domestic markets were normally regulated although the structure differed between countries. In some countries there were single state-owned monopoly carriers whereas in others, such as the US, there were private airlines but competition was highly regulated. In many cases, institutional barriers prevented domestic and international carriers of a country operating in each other's markets.",

The US initially legally removed most economic regulation from its domestic market in 1978 and other countries, either through de jure reforms or de facto actions, gradually loosened theirs. The move towards greater economic and, to a lesser degree political, integration in Europe in the 1990s brought with it the creation of a Single European Market, including that for air services. This embraces not simply the ability of airlines that meet safety and environmental criteria and do not violate European Union (EU)3\ncompetition policy from operating anywhere within Europe, but it also removed any ownership restrictions for airlines offering purely domestic or intra-Union services.",

From the studies that have been completed, it is clear that more open-air transportation markets foster trade and stimulate the growth of major industries such as tourism.

This is not surprising given that air transport carriers transport about 40% the world's trade by value and its importance is growing as structural economic changes take place. While excessive transportation will always be wasteful, optimal transportation supply as determined by market forces, constrained within appropriate institutional structures, is a major facilitator of economic development and allows countries and regions to exploit their comparative advantages more fully.",

Strategic alliances now dominate international air transportation. Although not all have been successful, in a commercial world there are inevitably failures, they have allowed wider network economies of scope, and density on the costs side, and economies of market presence on the demand side to be exploited. They also provide a degree of protection for airlines that would otherwise, in excessively competitive conditions that can emerge in aviation, find it difficult to recover their full costs even if they are highly efficient.9\nThis is confirmed in a variety of previous studies that have looked at some of these alliances. Although the links have seldom been explicitly drawn, the enhanced efficiency of international airlines, given the derived nature of the demands for their services, would seem inevitably to have improved the vitality and economic performances of the regions they serve.",

But even if the long-term projections prove excessive, there is a strong case for ensuring that the full comparative economic advantages of the EU economy are exploited.

There have been traditional concerns expressed by airline employees about erosion of their higher pay scales should EU workers be able to work in the US. This argument, however, seems rather moot in 2008 given the state of US airlines' finances and of the US dollar.

The analysis presented in Fig. 1 assumes that, in the Open Skies environment, fares are set to recover costs; in other words, competition and mergers policy can effectively fulfill the role of regulation. This raises issues as to the nature of a market served by a relatively small number of network carriers. A degree of competition exists between the various alliances for the trunk hauls market, and there is also competition at either end of routes with many other, including low cost, carriers competing for passengers in overlapping feeder and origin-destination traffic to international hub airports. There are also theoretical reasons derived from game theory suggesting that the outcome in a market with three players approaches that of competition. Nevertheless, each alliance by dint of product differentiation (e.g., they serve different airports) inevitably enjoys some degree of monopoly power.

In a similar vein, Virgin Atlantic Airlines own 23% of recently launched Virgin America that will provide feed for its North Atlantic routes at JFK and other international gateways. In the US and Europe there has been a considerable shift by the legacy carriers to develop their transatlantic services and, as part of a wider strategy, to consolidate, although at the time of writing exactly what combinations of carriers will combine is still far from certain.32\n",

Not everyone has gained, certainly some communities have lost airline services, some airlines have gone bankrupt, and some classes of passengers are now paying higher fares, but for those few that have been adversely affected there are many more who can fly more cheaply, have a greater variety of services to choose from, and have found jobs in the extended air transportation value chain. No positive change occurs without disruption, this has certainly been the experience of airlines, but these negative features have been far outweighed by the positive impacts.33\nOne would expect very much the same general outcome from the transatlantic Open Skies agreement. Since the move is to a more market-based system, the exact outcomes of the new institutional structure are, almost be definition impossible, to foresee; after all if one could predict them then these could have been enacted through command and control measures.",

Efforts to get a comprehensive Transatlantic agreement have proved challenging, however, in part because of somewhat differing views in Europe and the US on the meaning of free trade. What does seem to be clear, from a European perspective, is that there are benefits for the Union as a whole in adopting a uniform Open Skies agreement with the US, although there may be additional gains in extending this to a full and genuine Open Aviation Area of the type found within the US and the EU. The challenge now is to develop a mutually acceptable framework that allows both parties to move from a simple, product based, Open Skies to one that embodies the mobility of factors of production as well within a full open market.",
