            "text": "Bats are important reservoir hosts for emerging viruses, including coronaviruses that cause diseases in people. Although there have been several studies on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans and surrogate animals, there is little information on the interactions of these viruses with their natural bat hosts. We detected a coronavirus in the intestines of 53/174 hibernating little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), as well as in the lungs of some of these individuals. Interestingly, the presence of the virus was not accompanied by overt inflammation. Viral RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown bats. Sequence variation among coronavirus detected from individual bats suggested that infection occurred prior to hibernation, and that the virus persisted for up to 4 months of hibernation in the laboratory. Based on the sequence of its genome, the coronavirus was placed in the Alphacoronavirus genus, along with some human coronaviruses, bat viruses and the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus. The detection and identification of an apparently persistent coronavirus in a local bat species creates opportunities to understand the dynamics of coronavirus circulation in bat populations.",

            "text": "In recent years, three coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged to have a significant impact on global health and the global economy. Two of these, which cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS [1] ) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS [2] [3] [4] [5] ), are human pathogens. The SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 led to 8096 cases, with 10 % mortality in 27 countries [6] . Since September 2012, about 1900 cases of MERS have been reported, with a mortality rate of about 35 % [7] . The third coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhoea coronavirus (PED-CoV [8] ), was introduced into North American commercial pig herds and led to an economic loss of almost 2 billion dollars in the United States [9] . These three coronaviruses are believed to have spilled over from bats, because similar coronaviruses have been detected in bats [10, 11] . Interestingly, while coronaviruses cause serious and often fatal disease in their secondary hosts, such coronaviruses do not cause any clinical disease in their putative reservoir hosts, i.e. bats [12] [13] [14] . The reasons for this difference in outcomes for coronavirus infection, and the factors that lead to virus spillover, are not clearly understood. There are numerous studies on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and PED-CoV in humans and pigs [15] [16] [17] [18] , but there are few reports examining coronavirus interactions with their primary bat hosts [13, 14] . Our goal was, therefore, to identify coronaviruses in a common and widespread North American bat species and study virus-bat interactions within this species.",

Our results suggest that about a third of little brown bats are infected with several distinct clades of an Alphacoronavirus, and that the bats retain the virus for up to 4 months of hibernation. Since the bats we examined had been maintained as groups in isolated incubators or semiisolated cages, we were able to test the hypothesis that little brown bats in the wild are infected with closely related variants of a coronavirus. We predicted that, since the bats were randomly assigned to different incubators/cages, (1) prevalence of infection should be similar across incubators and cages, and (2) any variation in viral genomes should be evenly distributed among cages and incubators.",

Circumstantial evidence suggests that most alpha and beta coronaviruses parasitizing other mammals may also have originated in bats [23] . Little is known at present about the dynamics of coronavirus infection in the reservoir bat hosts, or how the viruses are spread from bat to bat, or from bats to other mammals. In this study, we examined a coronavirus in its natural host, the little brown bat. This study system provides a useful model for understanding factors that may promote spillovers. Our results suggest the following: (a) the Myotis coronavirus (Myl-CoV) is mainly present in the intestines and lungs; (b) co-hibernating little and big brown bats may share closely related coronaviruses; (c) Myl-CoV can persist in M. lucifugus for up to 4 months, the hibernation period of our experiment; and (d) the presence of Myl-CoV in bronchial epithelium is associated with minimal pathology or inflammation. However, a larger sample size under controlled conditions of exposure, with more rapid fixation of tissues, is required to fully characterize the lesions in lung and intestines. Dominguez et al. [24] and others [20] previously detected a coronavirus in little and big brown bats, suggesting that the virus may infect bats of both species, crossing between the bats at shared co-hibernation sites. The virus originally detected in a big brown bat was named the Rocky Mountain coronavirus [24] for the location of its initial detection. The RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown bats. Although the sequence traces did not suggest a mixture of PCR products, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the individual bats were infected with viruses from both clades, and that the PCR likely favoured the predominant viral component.",

How bat viruses are maintained in their natural host populations, or how they avoid extinction as host populations become immune and less susceptible, however, is not understood. It is possible to establish persistent infections in cultured cells with viruses that may have originated in bats, including Ebola virus [25] and SARS-CoV [26, 27] , but whether these viruses persist in their primary hosts is not known. The results of studies aimed at determining whether bat viruses persist in infected bats are controversial. There is no direct evidence for either persistence or transmission dynamics, and this is a knowledge gap in bat-virus ecology that needs to be addressed [28] .",

Based on the maximum mutation rate possible for the RdRp gene [29] , we should only have observed 1.16 random mutations in the 229 bp segment. Most of the intraand inter-clade polymorphisms exceeded this rate. Also, while the viruses detected in 2011 were primarily clade 1 and the 2012 viruses were primarily clade 2, both clades were detected in samples from either year. The differences between clades likely represent fixed nucleotide polymorphisms rather than random changes. Although recombination of coronavirus clades is possible, performing deep sequencing on the samples would enable us to negate this possibility. Ge and others also found the co-existence of a variety of coronavirus in bat colonies [30] .",

They concluded that these coronaviruses do not persist in their hosts, but are maintained in populations by the introduction of new susceptible individuals. Their results, however, do not rule out persistence in individual animals with low levels of virus replication and undetectable shedding, interspersed with short periods of increased replication and shedding. Our observations suggest that the Myl-CoV can persist in its hosts for at least the 4-month hibernation period. Due to strict biosecurity, spread of virus between incubators was unlikely and the distribution of variants among incubators (and cages) argues against spread within incubators (or cages). Our results therefore suggest that the bats were infected before they were collected.",

            "text": "Our histological lung sections provided a novel insight into the persistent infection of a coronavirus in its reservoir bat host. Firstly, we observed that the cells that were infected showed degenerative changes that resulted in rare multifocal areas of bronchiolar epithelial erosions, with no obvious inflammation targeting these lesions. The absence of neutrophilic infiltration is contrary to what has been seen in non-bat species affected by similar coronaviruses. Previous studies in transgenic mice showed that HCoV-229E infection led to massive neutrophilic infiltrate [31] . Lung samples from piglets infected with PED-CoV showed the presence of moderate neutrophilic infiltrate (even though PED-CoV has a predilection for intestines) [32] . Hibernating bats do appear to be capable of a local inflammatory response following fungal infection [33] . A low level of neutrophilic infiltration in coronavirus-infected lungs reinforces the fact that bats are unique in the way that they respond to a coronavirus infection. Lower inflammation might be due to fewer chemotactic factors being produced as a result of infection, which might be an inherent feature of M. lucifugus. It might also be that bat neutrophils are more efficient at controlling virus infection and obviating a massive neutrophilic infiltrate. An alternative explanation for the lack of inflammation in bats may be that cell necrosis occurs at the epithelial surface, with dead cells sloughing into the lumen. The cytokines required to stimulate inflammation and immunity might not enter the interstitium and the systemic circulation. An infection that is localized to epithelial cells without breaching the basement membrane is a good strategy for a virus to allow persistence of infection. However, in our study the sample size was small and it is difficult to reach a firm conclusion about the host's response to coronavirus infection.",

The virus then persists at low levels, probably undetectable in faecal material. Due to limited replication in bronchial epithelial cells, there is little host response against the virus, favouring persistence.

Tissue sections were incubated twice in xylene for 15 min each and then rehydrated in graded alcohol. Tissue sections were then incubated overnight in 0.5 mM PBS for better antigen retrieval. We added 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol to tissue sections for 20 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase. After distilled water washing, 500 \u00b5l of proteinase K (20 \u00b5g in 1 ml) treatment for 20 min at 37 C was performed to enhance antigen retrieval. Slides were blocked using 1 % bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The serum of the rabbits (56th day bleed) containing anti-Myl-CoV N were used as the primary antibodies for staining virus infected cells (1 : 100 dilution). For every slide processed, we also stained slides with the serum extracted prior to antigen injection (pre-bleed) as a negative control. Formalin-fixed Myl-CoV-N-transfected Efk cells were used as a positive control. Tissue sections were incubated with the primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature, followed by 3\u00c25 min washes with 0.5 mM PBS. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Zymed) was used as a secondary antibody (1 : 500 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. After 3\u00c25 min washes with 0.5 mM PBS, colour was developed using 500 \u00b5l of diaminobenzidine (30 ul diaminobenzidine, 9 \u00b5l 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 3 ml 0.5 mM PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin for 30 s and then decolourized using acetic acidacetone. Slides were dehydrated using graded alcohol and then treated with xylene before coverslips were applied. Formalin-fixed Myl-CoV-N-transfected Eptesicus fuscus kidney (Efk) cells [42] were used as a positive control. Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin.",

Five categories of lesions were established: diffuse lung inflammation, inflammation of bronchus, bronchiolar epithelial vacuolation, bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia and bronchiolar epithelial erosion. All lung sections from all bats were examined to determine the range of changes and then changes were scored between 0 and 3, with 0 indicating normal and 3 indicating the most severe change within the eight bats examined. The maximum score of 3 would still be considered mild within the typical pathology scoring system describing the severity of inflammatory response: mild, moderate or severe.",

Groups of bats were isolated in incubators with little likelihood of cross-infection during hibernation. (a) Maximum-likelihood tree of nucleotide sequence variation. The colour of the box indicates the bat's hibernation incubator. The first two digits indicate the year of the experiment (2010-2011 or 2011-2012) and the bat's identification number. For 2011-2012 each incubator contained two cages, designated either T or C. Corresponding sequences from a coronavirus from Myotis lucifugus (Myotis-CoV-USA-2006, GenBank accession number KF430219) and from Eptesicus fuscus (HQ336976) were included in the analysis and are in white boxes. The numbers at the nodes are the bootstrap values (per cent) obtained for 1000 replicates.",

Cells stained for Myl-CoV N protein (indicated by arrows) were vacuolated and in some cases sloughed into the bronchial lumen.Only bronchial epithelial cells had detectable viral antigen. (b) Pathology of Myl-CoV-infected lung. H and E staining of bat lung infected with coronavirus. Vacuolation of infected cells (shown by an arrowhead) was present along the bronchial epithelium. A portion of bronchial epithelium was sloughed off (shown by an arrow). Neutrophils were observed in the vicinity of the infected portion of the bronchus, but the overall inflammation in the entire lung was low.

Bats are infected with one of the closely related coronaviruses that are distinguishable from each other by minor nucleotide polymorphisms. The virus then persists at low levels during hibernation. Due to limited replication in bronchial epithelial cells, there is little host response against the virus, favouring persistence. Na\u00efve and susceptible young individuals acquire the virus in maternity roosts when viral replication and shedding increases, caused by hormonal changes or other stress factors Bats enter hibernation with the infection present in them. During hibernation, the virus persists due to low levels of physiological and physical activity, and low levels of inflammation.",
