It has been considered that apoptosis in the hippocampus occurs as a result of immune-triggered bystander effects during the course of infection, [6] [7] [8] which has been indicated by our previous report 2 showing that the viral antigens in the hippocampus are mainly found in the CD11b-positive cells distributed in the stratum oriens located outside the pyramidal layer, and only a few pyramidal neurons are infected. Furthermore, the apoptotic cells, indicated as showing caspase 3 (Cas3) activation, consist of a high number of uninfected cells. Such bystander effects causing pyramidal cell apoptosis are also observed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). 9 The bystander effects are considered to be the result of elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines detected in the course of diseases, such as TNF-\u03b1, 7-9 IL-6, 8 IL-1\u03b2 7 and MCP-1. 4 Therefore, we examined the local expression of several kinds of proinflammatory cytokines including those reportedly associated with hippocampal damage.

Intensive cell infiltration, leading to a dense population of monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mas), is only observed in the meninges during the early phase of infection. 1, 10, 12 Furthermore, it has been indicated that the immunosuppressive state after infection is mediated by expression of the Lewis X (Le x ) carbohydrate structure 13 using mutant mice that lack \u03b11,3-fucosyltransferase 9 (Fut9 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) and are unable to synthesize the Le x structure. 14 Our study comparing wild-type and Fut9 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that leukocytes derived from infected wildtype mice were unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, whereas those from Fut9 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice responded to the challenge, although the stimulation of leukocytes derived from the two strains through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 similarly caused high-level responses. 10, 15 The immunosuppressive state observed in the wild-type mice after infection mimics the state in endotoxin tolerance (ET), or LPS tolerance, known as a classic example of a protective mechanism to prevent an excessive inflammatory response. 16 The state of ET is mediated by suppressor cells, which are a Gr-1-and CD11b-positive (Gr-1 + CD11b + ) population of Mo/Mas. 16 In this report, although we showed the IL-10 expression of the pyramidal neurons in CA2 and CA3 subregions, for the first time in the world, after infection with Mu-3, we could not demonstrate that Mu-3 is capable of inducing the production of IL-10 after infection using brain tissue culture.

The failure to detect cytokines in the tissue extracts with the multiplex bead-based immunoassay, in spite of their local expression being detected by tissue immunostaining, is due to their more sensitive assessment by the latter compared with the former, shown in our previous study. 17 The level of IFN\u03b2 in the supernatant of peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) culture was undetectable after Mu-3 infection when measured by the multiplex bead-based immunoassay, although, by immunostaining of cultured PECs after infection, IFN-\u03b2-producing cells were detected at a distance from infected cells. Nevertheless, the multiplex bead-based immunoassay revealed that the infection inhibited productions of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus compared with the pons. The levels of cytokines measured in the pons might be a reflection of intensive and moderate inflammatory cell invasion in the meninges and fourth ventricle adjacent to the pons, respectively. 10, 12, 22 The hippocampus can be more sensitive, hence more vulnerable, to external stress 4,23 than other areas of the brain, leading to elevated levels of cytokines in the hippocampus of sham-infected mice at 2 dpi. The response observed on sham-infection, which did not induce anti-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus at a detectable level, might have been suppressed by viral infection. Viruses have evolved various strategies to circumvent the innate immune response, 24 and coronaviruses are known to block type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling and counter the action of downstream effector molecules. 25 Our findings indicate that the production of many proinflammatory cytokines other than IFN-I is also suppressed in the brain by Mu-3 infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 209, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 443, "end": 445, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 446, "end": 448, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1010, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1684, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1688, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1691, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2163, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2289, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "However, until 4 dpi, viral antigens are undetectable in the hippocampus. 2 How can the area sense viral invasion that has occurred distant from the hippocampus? The same question arose when we detected IL-10 expression in the hippocampus at 3 dpi. Furthermore, it was the pyramidal neurons that expressed IL-10 and not CD11b-positive Mo/Mas, which can migrate into the hippocampus. The failure of the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by Mo/Mas or microglia after infection was also detected by the brain primary culture, where a large population of CD-11b-positive cells are found, 20 although we have shown, for the first time, that coronaviral infection can trigger the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by Mo/Mas in PECs within 8 h post-infection (hpi). 17 The answer to the question of how information on infection reaches the hippocampus is provided by our previous reports. 20, 22 As early as 12 hpi with cl-2, a unique reticular network (RN) is formed in the meninges, ventricle, ventricular wall, and brain surface facing the meninges, which extends deep into the brain parenchyma with an association with astrocytic fibers within 48 hpi. 22 The fibers of the RN (RNfib) are positive for antigens, such as collagen, laminin, and ER-TR7 antigen (ERag), the most important marker of the fibroblastic RN (FRN) in lymphoid organs. The fibers of FRN in the lymphoid organs contain collagen fibers as a core, which is wrapped by an ERag-positive extracellular matrix (ECM), and further by a basement membrane enriched with laminin. 26 The FRN functions as a conduit system, transferring substances such as cytokines and antigens to facilitate immune responses, and guiding the homing of leukocytes. 27 The RN in the brain, referred to as astrocytic RN (ARN), 20 could have quickly transferred the information about the viral invasion to the cells deep in the brain parenchyma, like FRN does in the lymphoid organs. In addition, cell-to-cell-mediated cross-talk, like that occurring through an immune synapse formed between lymphoid cells, 28 using either immune-related or nonimmune-related molecules such as neurotransmitters, 29 might contribute to transmit the signal from the infected site to neurons in the hippocampus in order to produce IL-10.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 75, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 775, "end": 777, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 898, "end": 901, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 902, "end": 904, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1167, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1554, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1721, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1781, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2148, "end": 2150, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Although a number of articles have reported that many kinds of cytokines are produced in the CNS), under either healthy or unhealthy states, 30,31 by either invading cells such as inflammatory cells or domestic cells, including neurons and astrocytes, 32, 33 to our knowledge, the in vivo production of IL-10 by neurons has not been reported.
