For patients without a baseline creatinine in the 7 to 365 days prior to admission, the admission creatinine was imputed based upon a Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) estimated glomerular filtration fraction (eGFR) of 75 ml/min/1.73m as per the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI guidelines. 7 We assessed in-hospital mortality defined by survival status at discharge. As a subset of patients was not discharged at the time of this manuscript preparation, subgroup analysis was performed 1) AKI with and without dialysis 2) in patients that were discharged, died, and had at least 14 days, and 3) discharged alive and those who had inhospital mortality. The need for acute dialysis was ascertained by procedure codes and was cross-referenced with nursing flow sheets. For AKI recovery, we compared the last hospital creatinine with the baseline creatinine and grouped them as recovered, or with acute kidney disease (AKD) Stages 1, 2, or 3 (Supplemental Table 2 ). 8 We used local regression (loess) for smoothening creatinine values across the interval of two weeks post hospital admission to visualize trajectories by AKD category.",
