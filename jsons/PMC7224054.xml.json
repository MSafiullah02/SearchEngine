The life cycle of this protozoan has definitive and intermediate hosts. The definitive hosts are usually the predators, such as felids, canids, and humans. Sexual reproduction occurs in the intestine of the definitive host and results in the excretion of oocysts in the feces [9]. Intermediate hosts (typically, herbivores) become infected by ingesting the water or food contaminated with oocysts excreted from the definitive host [8]. Sheep can be infected by at least four species of Sarcocystis. S. tenella and S. arietcanis form microscopic cysts (microcysts) in muscles and have canids as the definitive host. S. gigantea and S. medusiformis form macroscopic cysts (macrocysts) in muscles and have the domestic cat (Felis catus) as the definitive host [8]. In studies on slaughtered sheep in Rio Grande do Sul, microcysts were found in 76.2% of myocardial [22], and both macrocysts and microcysts were found in 96.1% of muscle tissue [16].",
