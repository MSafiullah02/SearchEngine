            "text": "The MTBI summer program runs for 8 weeks. In the first 3 weeks, students attend lectures in theoretical ecology and various epidemiological-contact-contagion modeling techniques, as used in broadly understood dynamical systems: nonlinear systems of difference and differential equations, discrete and continuous time Markov chains, partial differential equations and agent based modeling. In the final 5 weeks of the program, students form self-selected groups of three to five undergraduates, and investigate a problem of their own choosing. They research the background of the problem, identify a question, construct a model to address the question, analyze the results, and write a technical report describing their project. While the faculty mentors\u2019 experience is primarily in mathematical biology, students\u2019 interests can be quite diverse [21]. Past projects have included such diverse topics as epidemiology [1, 4, 5, 12, 27, 38, 39, 47, 48], eating disorders [40, 41], party politics [13, 57], prison education [2, 49], immigration [25], the menstrual cycle [37], education [29, 30, 32, 42], and ecology [28, 45, 55, 56]. Because of the broad variety of student selected topics, students frequently know a lot more about the modeling application than the mentors do. Students take the lead on the project and provide subject matter knowledge, while mentors provide general expertise in mathematical modeling techniques that can be applied to a broad variety of topics.",

By far the most popular techniques for reproductive analysis at MTBI have been the next generation matrix (NGM) and sensitivity analysis. These are extremely powerful, accessible, and flexible techniques that can be applied to a broad variety of situations. Since the founding of the REU in 1996 to the present year of 2018, students have written 211 technical reports. Of these reports, 34.6% have used sensitivity analysis, 22.7% have used the NGM, and 12.3% have used both. Since the techniques became popular with MTBI students in 2003, there have been 140 technical reports: 50.7% have used sensitivity analysis, 31.4% have used the NGM, and 19.3% have used both [51].",

But for models with a lot of compartments or a lot of non-linearities, a direct analysis of the disease-free equilibrium can be extremely algebraically intensive. In 1990, Diekmann et al. [33] developed a new approach to finding the basic reproductive number that uses a reduced form of the model. This reduces the computational complexity of the problem of stability and makes complex models more accessible. It is a method that has become very popular with our own students, but tutorials can be difficult to find, so we decided to share this method of finding R\n0 here, along with some techniques for interpreting the results.",

Current treatments can force the disease into the asymptomatic stage, but cannot eliminate the disease from the body entirely, so it always returns. When the disease emerges, initial symptoms resemble a lot of other diseases, while later symptoms are distinctive. Current protocols only administer treatment when the disease has progressed to the later stage, and the patient has already been infections for some time. The question the Luis Almonte-Vega, Monica Col\u00f3n-Vargas, Ligia Luna-Jarr\u0144, Joel Martinez, and Jordy Rodriguez-Rinc\u00f3n, wanted to study was the cost effectiveness of treating during the early stages when the disease is less infectious, but money would be wasted on treating false positives.

In order for a male to infect another male, the disease must first infect a female, and vice-versa. So the number of new infected males produced by a single infected male is the number of infected females produced by that infected male, times the number of infected males produced by each new infected female. For example, if a male infects 8 females, and each female infects 2 males, then the number of newly infected males produced by that original male would be 8 \u22c5 2 = 16. But this is a two-step process. In order to scale the process back to a single infection step, we need to average the two values.

Currently, there are three subtypes of influenza A, with variants of each subtype, called strains, being continuously generated across the world and transported primarily by the mobility patterns of billions of individuals. Influenza involves what it is known as seasonal and pandemic variants. The kind spread and its impact depends on the variation between strains. The 1918 pandemic was devastating and it has been linked to at least 50 million deaths. Vaccines, typically effective against seasonal influenza, are in general ineffective against novel strains, the most likely of drivers of pandemic influenza. As an outbreak sweeps a region, it alters the average immunological profile of a population. By how much? Well it depends on levels of protection, cross-immunity, that may protect against future strains. Some relevant references include [8, 10, 52].",
