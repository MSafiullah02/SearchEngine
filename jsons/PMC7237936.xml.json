Labour has been suddenly restricted in many regions due to quarantine measures and loss of workforce from COVID-19 deaths and serious illness. There have been substantial restrictions on international labour movements and worker programs that are critical to agricultural production in some sectors or that have caused bottlenecks. Anecdotally, this seems particularly severe in horticulture, livestock production systems, and processing but also for planting and harvesting of crops that are relatively labour-intensive. The timing of labour needs is often inflexible for seasonally produced foods. Resolving these labour shortages and designing working conditions that are safe for workers and the community, is of critical importance in order to secure future growing seasons and avoid disastrous consequences for future food security and supply.",

Will emergency measures, such as recruiting temporary domestic volunteers or chartering special flights and paying workers during quarantines be sufficient? Can we make workers safer given that many are in dormitory style housing and/or work on assembly lines that are incompatible with maintaining physical distancing? If workers cannot be safe, and be perceived to be so, while the virus is circulating in the community, what will the effects on food systems be? Can all regions fill their labour shortages sufficiently? What different approaches to this problem might there be? Will there be major and permanent changes in international agri-food labour availability and movements and, if so, how might agricultural systems adapt?",

Are small farms, that primarily use family labour and so are less dependent on externally hired labour, more resilient than large farms which depend on external labour? What technological measures could to be adopted to reduce dependency on human labour and gain efficiency in farming? What are the short- and long-term consequences of unequal access to resilience tools and measures? How will local, regional, national and international agricultural systems respond to large losses of agricultural production during the pandemic? Which countermeasures against the virus will have very long-term effects? How can we reorient our agricultural systems to function optimally in a post-COVID-19 world? What is the role of agricultural policy in boosting resilience of agricultural systems? Do our policies need to change going forward or are we already well equipped to safeguard our agricultural systems from similar shocks in the future?

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on international relationships far beyond the agri-food sector's labour force. This includes announcements of export restrictions across several countries that limit global agri-food trade and market access (see for example Laborde and IFPRI, 2020). The agri-food sector is highly connected internationally. Ports that shut down or reduce activity, vastly reduced freight capacity on commercial flights for agricultural goods, and other broad global supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 crisis (Ivanov, 2020) have the potential to limit critical access to agricultural inputs and markets. This may negatively impact agricultural productivity for current and future seasons. The suddenness and severity of these shutdowns leave little scope for identifying suitable domestic substitutes in the short term but may spur less reliance on global agri-food value chains in the future. Some nations are also exploring more domestic \u2018food sovereignty\u2019 in order to address emerging domestic food security concerns due to COVID-19. These actions have serious implications for our current globalized agri-food trading system and is potentially one of the most important impacts on the current food system.",
