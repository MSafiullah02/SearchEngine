Looking at the disease-causing potential of Phlebovirus910, a preliminary investigation was conducted during 2014-2015 among human population residing adjacent to Robber's caves to determine the seroprevalence of Malsoor virus if any. This study was important due to lack of data about this novel virus and its disease-causing potential in human. Prior permission and approval of Institutional Human Ethical Committee and Animal Ethical Committee were obtained to initiate this study. During 2014-2015, blood samples (3-5 ml) of 174 participants were collected from three villages within a radius of <5 km from Robber's cave (Malusar wadi, Malusar village and Chikhali). Tapola village was included as a control village which was 22 km away from the caves. Details of the human population investigated are mentioned in the Table. Among all the participants, only three persons had a history of epistaxis. Besides these, three persons had a history of fever. No other relevant major illnesses were reported.",

ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisob plates, Thermofisher Scientific, USA) were coated with Gamma-irradiated Malsoor virus antigen11 (Row A to D) and Vero CCL-81 cell (ATCC, USA) control antigen (Row E to H) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.2, 0.025 M) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, wells were blocked [1 h incubation with wash buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)]. One hundred microlitres of diluted sample (1:100 in 1% BSA in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween) was added to duplicate wells of Malsoor virus and control antigen-coated wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for one hour. One hundred microlitres of anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies (Thermofisher Scientific) (1:10,000) were added and further incubated one hour at 37\u00b0C. After each incubation, the ELISA plate was washed four times with wash buffer. One hundred microlitres of (3,3\u2019,5,5,\u2019-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added and incubated for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by 1N H2 SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. As positive human serum sample against Malsoor virus was not available, triplicates of substrate control and negative control (normal human serum) were used for optimization of ELISA. The cut-off for ELISA was calculated using sufficient numbers (50-100) of negative samples from the population. The cut-off was calculated as mean OD of the negative control plus 3 standard deviations. For anti-Malsoor bat IgG ELISA, anti-bat IgG HRP conjugate (1:8000) was used. Bat sample positive for Malsoor virus by nRT-PCR was used as positive control for optimization of anti-Malsoor Bat IgG ELISA.",
