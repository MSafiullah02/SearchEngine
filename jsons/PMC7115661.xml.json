The virus spreads mainly via saliva and nasal secretions [2] and infection results in one of several outcomes. Cats that mount a sufficiently powerful immune response will recover, usually with the development of virus neutralising antibodies (VNAb) [3], and FeLV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) [4]. Infected cats that do not mount an adequate immune response are usually anergic to the virus and become persistently viraemic [5], [6]. Most viraemic cats succumb to FeLV-related disease within 2\u20134 years of infection. Many of the animals that ostensibly recover develop a latent infection in which the virus is restricted by the host immune response to the bone marrow and probably other tissues [7], [8]. In the majority of these cases, virus is eliminated from the bone marrow within 30 months of exposure [9], [10], but in some cases may persist and may be reactivated in animals that are immunosuppressed or treated with corticosteroids [8].",

            "text": "Studies of the immune response to FeLV have shown that recovery from infection is associated with the initial development of virus-specific CTL followed by the appearance of VNAb [4]. It follows, therefore, that a vaccine designed to stimulate cell-mediated immunity, such as DNA vaccination, may be particularly useful in blocking the initial stages of FeLV infection. Indeed, a DNA vaccine consisting of plasmid vectors encoding gag/pol and env genes of FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 [19] protected cats against both the establishment of persistent viraemia and latency when administered together with plasmids encoding feline IL-12 and IL-18 [1]. The rationale for using both cytokines was that IL-12 and IL-18 act synergistically on T and natural killer (NK) cells to stimulate the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), a mediator of the induction of CTL [20], [21]. In the previous vaccination study [1], those animals that were protected by the vaccine had higher virus-specific effector CTL in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs than cats that became persistently viraemic [4]. However, the relative contribution of each cytokine to the efficacy of the vaccine was not established: the IL-18 construct alone in combination with the FeLV DNA was not tested for efficacy, and the failure of the IL-12 construct to act as an adjuvant might have been due to inappropriate expression of both subunits. In order to resolve this issue, we have now carried out a further study using improved IL-12 and IL-18 cytokine constructs, and have tested the efficacy of each genetic adjuvant independently as well as together.",

[1], that a vaccine containing FeLV gag/pol and env genes together with the cytokine gene adjuvants IL-12 and IL-18 provides complete protection against FeLV viraemia in cats. The rationale for using these particular cytokines was that they induce cell-mediated immune responses, which at that time were believed to be responsible for protection against FeLV infection, and are now known to be involved [6]. While each cytokine promotes a Th1 type of immune response, IL-12 and IL-18 act synergistically by enhancing the expression of IFN-\u03b3 [20], a pleotropic cytokine that is crucial to the normal functioning of cell-mediated immunity [41]. In the previous FeLV DNA vaccine study, the relative role of each cytokine gene was not established; a group of cats vaccinated with FeLV DNA and IL-18 alone was not included in the vaccine trial and there were doubts about the efficacy of the IL-12 construct. In particular, since the subunits of IL-12 were expressed from separate plasmids, it was possible that p40 homodimer formation antagonised active IL-12 [25], inhibiting the adjuvant effect of the cytokine. Therefore, in the present study a primary aim was to modify the cytokine constructs of feline IL-12 and IL-18 and to show that each cytokine was expressed at high levels in vitro and was bioactive, prior to their use in the vaccine experiment.",

The two subunits, p35 and p40 were linked by a peptide linker sequence (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)3 minus the leader sequence of the downstream subunit [26]. Several other IL-12 constructs have been reported, including subunits encoded on separate plasmids [1], subunits encoded in tandem under a variety of promoter systems [42], [43], the use of an internal ribosome entry site sequence between subunits [44], and a self-cleaving peptide 2A of foot-and-mouth disease virus [45]. However, only the structure of flexi-IL-12 ensures that there is production of equimolar amounts of each subunit so that p40 homodimer formation is prevented. Studies on murine IL-12 constructs found that flexi-IL-12 with the p40 subunit situated upstream, elicited the highest level of bioactivity of all constructs. Accordingly, feline flexi-IL-12 was designed in this way.",

Oronasal administration is the preferred method as it more closely simulates natural infection than intraperitoneal inoculation that was used previously [1]. We considered that it was important to establish whether a vaccine administered by parenteral inoculation could protect against challenge by the natural mucosal route. In order to overcome the natural resistance to oronasal FeLV infection that develops in kittens of the age used in the trial, a protocol was employed in which fractionated doses of virus were given over a period of 8 days. Previously, 83% of 15\u201317-week-old cats developed persistent viraemia using this schedule [37]. In the present study, only 4/6 of the non-vaccinated control kittens became persistently viraemic, which per se made comparison of the efficacy of each vaccine difficult because of the small numbers of animals in each group. However, the remaining two cats had latent infections and comparisons based on the total number of overt and covert infections allowed more meaningful comparisons to be made.",

Clearly, the combination of cytokine genes together with FeLV DNA provided excellent protection, as before. We also found that ILRAP-IL-18 alone was sufficiently potent as an adjuvant to protect animals from persistent viraemia and latent infection, whereas the flexi-IL-12 adjuvant did not produce significant protection. This result is in line with studies of other viruses that failed to demonstrate a positive effect of IL-12 on DNA vaccination, including FIV [47], feline coronavirus [48] or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [49]. Indeed, in some of these studies, inhibition of the anti-viral immune response was found. In certain cases, immunosuppression has been related to the dose of IL-12 DNA and the timing of IL-12 administration. Thus, high doses of recombinant murine IL-12 increased the susceptibility of mice to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus whereas lower doses enhanced the immune response [50]; and an adenovirus vector expressing IL-12 enhanced the cellular immune response to a hepatitis C vaccine, but higher doses of IL-12 abrogated this effect [51]. In addition, immunosuppression was induced when IL-12 was administered before or together with JEV, but not if given after the immunisation [49].",

Many other studies have shown the positive effect of IL-18 DNA as a gene adjuvant to DNA vaccination [52], [53]. The predominant function of IL-18 in the immune system is the stimulation of the Th1-type immune response through production of IFN-\u03b3 [20], [21]. IL-18 also enhances the proliferation of T cells in a dose-dependent manner, an effect that is not IFN-\u03b3 dependent [20]. In addition, this cytokine selectively enhances Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated cytotoxicity of murine Th1 cells, and stimulates perforin-dependent cytotoxicity of NK cells [54], [55]. Therefore, the functions of IL-18 explain the impressive protective effect of ILRAP-IL-18 that was observed in this study. As a gene adjuvant, ILRAP-IL-18 enhanced the cell-mediated immune response that has been shown to be vital in resistance to FeLV, particularly in the early stages of viral infection [6].",

As in the previous trial, none of the vaccines induced VNAb before challenge. In fact no commercial FeLV vaccine consistently induces VNAb, although non-neutralising antibodies to the antigens in the vaccine, such as gp70, are elicited [32], [56]. Analysis of the few feline DNA vaccination experiments that have been documented, show varying humoral responses to the antigen concerned. In one case, a minimalistic immunogenic defined gene expression vector, which expressed FIV gp140 and feline IL-12, elicited protection without producing a specific humoral response [57]. However, a DNA plasmid encoding FIV gp120 was found to induce a virus-specific antibody response [58]. Evidence suggests that the particular viral antigen used, as well as the vaccine schedule and route of administration have a strong influence over the presence or type of immune response produced, including the development of specific antibodies. While the level of protection achieved in this trial was very high, it was not due to sterilising immunity since anti-FeLV antibodies were produced by all of the cats following challenge. However, the median VNAb titre of the kittens vaccinated with FeLV DNA and IL-18 DNA that resisted the challenge was lower than that of the few cats in the control groups that did not become viraemic. Although this difference in titre was not significantly different, the result gives an indication that virus growth might have been inhibited in the vaccinated kittens immediately following challenge.",
