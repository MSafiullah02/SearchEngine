Practical advice would include continuation of home exercises last prescribed, and continued attendance at rehabilitation centers if well but with stepped-up infection control measures such as patient screening for fever and flu symptoms at the entrance. Systematic reviews on telerehabilitation interventions poststroke have demonstrated either better or equal salutary effects on motor, higher cortical, and mood disorders compared with conventional face-to-face therapy.13 However, studies on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation for nonstroke conditions are still lacking. Nevertheless, during situations like outbreaks, telerehabilitation has the additional advantage of continuing rehabilitation supervision remotely without the risk of virus exposure.",

Diabetes is also a risk factor for common conditions that require rehabilitation like cardiovascular disease and stroke which themselves increase the mortality risk. Other common conditions needing rehabilitation like chronic respiratory disease and cancer are also associated with higher risk of mortality from 2019-nCoV. Hence, our rehabilitation patients are at higher risk of severe and fatal 2019-nCoV infections. For those who are capable of performing rehabilitation at home with guidance from telerehabilitation, this should be their first option. For the rest who need center-based or inpatient rehabilitation, we recommend fever and flu symptom monitoring to separate the well from the unwell, and strict infection control measures including handwashing between patients to reduce virus transmission. Patients who are symptomatic should be separated from the well, quarantined and tested for 2019-nCoV, and isolated and treated if positive. Hospital management should designate and prepare isolation rooms with adequate PPE and trained staff.",

This usually involves arrangements like split teams, restricted movement, and work-from-home arrangements. With the exception of clerical staff and telerehabilitation, it is impractical for rehabilitation HCWs to work from home because our discipline is very hands-on. Hence, strategies like split teams and restricted movement are more relevant in rehabilitation. Split teams is complete physical division of a workforce into (usually 2) subteams with each containing the necessary skill sets to continue most of its functions if 1 subteam becomes unable to work. Restricted movement is another strategy whereby the principle is every member in a subteam does not come in physical contact with any staff from other subteam(s) to minimize risk of cross-infection. Hospital management should also review triage processes at entry points and workflows that separate high-risk from low-risk areas and subteams. Other often forgotten issues are HCWs who are parents of young children. If schools or day care centers close and both parents are working, HCWs may be forced to stay home to look after them. HCWs may also be afraid to return home after work in fear of passing loved ones the virus if infected and infectious during the asymptomatic phase. Hospital management should also explore alternative childcare and temporary rooming arrangements for staff.",
