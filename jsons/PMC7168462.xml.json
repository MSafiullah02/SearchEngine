Proteins from body fluids, tissues or cells are first separated on a thin gel layer according to their isoelectric charge (first dimension). This gel is then placed across a larger gel, and the proteins are separated in the second dimension, at right angles to the first, according to their size. This technique can separate (resolve) over 1000 proteins per gel. Individual proteins can then be excised and purified for identification, usually by mass spectrometry (see Box 3B).",
