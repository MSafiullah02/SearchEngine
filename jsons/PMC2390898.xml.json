            "text": "Nucleic acid-based strategies used to block gene expression include RNA decoys and antisense compounds. RNA decoys are oligoribonucleotides that compete for a translational activator or mRNA-stabilizing elements, and cause translation inhibition or mRNA destruction (Beelman and Parker, 1995, Liebhaber, 1997). Antisense strategies employ various structural types of RNA- or DNA-based oligomers, ribozymes or DNAzymes, and small-interfering RNAs (siRNA). All of these approaches are based on Watson-Crick base-pairing of antisense agent to complementary sequence in the mRNA selected for targeting. To be useful in vivo these strategies will likely need to utilize modified nucleic acid backbone structures to provide protection from host nucleases. Additionally, a candidate therapeutic must be able to effectively enter cells of relevant tissues and access target RNA. PMO are structurally similar to single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, but have a different backbone; a morpholine ring replaces the deoxyribose sugar, and a phosphorodiamidate linkage replaces the phosphodiester linkage of DNA (Fig. 1\n) (Schmajuk et al., 1999, Summerton, 1999). PMOs are uncharged, water-soluble, highly resistant to nuclease degradation (Hudziak et al., 2000), and are typically synthesized to be approximately 20 bases in length. PMO can bind to target mRNA and prevent translation initiation by steric blockade, which is distinct from the RNase H-dependent mechanism of action induced by antisense structural types based on DNA chemistry (Summerton, 1999). Additionally, PMO conjugated to small, positively charged peptides have far greater delivery efficiency to cells in culture than non-conjugated PMO (Moulton et al., 2003, Moulton et al., 2004).",

To our knowledge, the application of PMO-technology against a DNA virus has not yet been reported.

            "text": "KSHV is a large DNA virus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a type of skin tumor recognized as the most common malignancy among patients with AIDS. KSHV is also associated with several lymphoproliferative disorders, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) (Cesarman et al., 1995a, Chang et al., 1994, Soulier et al., 1995). Like other herpesviruses, KSHV causes two modes of infection: latent and lytic. In latency, the KSHV genome persists with limited gene expression in host cells (Fakhari and Dittmer, 2002, Sarid et al., 1998). LANA, encoded by ORF73, has a major role in the maintenance of KSHV latency (Ballestas et al., 1999, Lan et al., 2004, Lim et al., 2002, Lim et al., 2004, Shinohara et al., 2002). LANA interacts with p53 and represses its transcriptional activity (Friborg et al., 1999), targets retinoblastoma-E2F transcriptional regulatory pathway, and transforms primary rat cells in cooperation with the oncogene Hras (Radkov et al., 2000). LANA also up-regulates the telomerase promoter (Verma et al., 2004) and modulates host cellular gene expression (An et al., 2005, Renne et al., 2001). Mutagenic disruption of ORF73 can lead to abortive KSHV episome persistence (Ye et al., 2004). When KSHV latency is disrupted the virus switches to a lytic phase in which infectious virions are produced, and then spread from cell to cell. The lytic reactivation of virus replication in PEL cells can be induced by various chemicals, such as the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) and sodium butyrate (Renne et al., 1996). KSHV lytic replication can be divided into immediate-early, early and late stages. A key immediate-early gene, ORF50 encodes RTA, and this protein activates viral lytic gene expression (Sun et al., 1998).",

Proinflammatory cytokines are considered to be essential for the development of KSHV-associated malignancies (Ensoli et al., 1991, Moore et al., 1996). In KSHV-infected PEL cells and in KS lesions, a low percentage (<5%) of cells maintain KSHV lytic replication (Miller et al., 1997). Lytic cycle activation is a pivotal event in the cascade of events involved with KSHV replication. RTA is essential as a controlling factor of viral replication during the lytic phase, and contributes to the development of KSHV-associated diseases. In this report, we demonstrate highly efficient uptake of P-PMO by KSHV-infected BCBL-1 cells, as well as highly effective sequence-specific inhibition of RTA and LANA protein expression. Viral genes characteristically expressed downstream of RTA were also suppressed as a result of specific P-PMO-mediated inhibition.",

Relative percentages of fluorescence intensity were calculated in comparison to the mock-treatment control.

To obtain confirmation that the LP1 P-PMO was capable of binding to its target RNA, a cell-free reporter assay with LP1/luciferase RNA, similar to the RP1/luciferase system described above, was conducted. LP1 was found to be effective at inhibiting translation in this reporter system (data not shown).

A recent report described the transfection efficiency of BCBL-1 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 liposome (Invitrogen) to be approximately 10% (Zhu et al., 2004). PMO are non-charged compounds and, therefore, the use of cationic lipids to deliver them cultured cells is ineffective (Ghosh and Iversen, 2000, Morcos, 2001). The conjugation of arginine-rich peptides to PMO has proven to be an efficient means to deliver PMO into cultured cells. In this study, R5F2R4-PMO were tested for cellular uptake and persistence in BCBL-1 cells. The presence of P-PMO-F1 in treated BCBL-1 cells indicated that R5F2R4 assisted in PMO uptake; as the corresponding PMO-F1 failed in the uptake assay. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that P-PMO-F1 entered over 95% of the cells. Furthermore, The P-PMO-F1 persisted for one week after a single application. The uptake assays were conducted in the absence of serum in the cell culture media. The R5F2R4-PMO used in this study achieve relatively poor cellular uptake when applied in the presence of serum. There have been recent reports, however, of a peptide-PMO conjugate (RXR)4XB-PMO, which is capable of effective delivery into cells in the presence of serum (Deas et al., 2005, Nelson et al., 2005). Delivery into relevant cells in vivo has been a major challenge in the development of nucleic acid-based therapeutic strategies.",

Testing the effect of P-PMO on target protein expression in these cells has distinct relevance to a natural KSHV infection, as these cell lines were derived from patients with PEL. The IFA and Western blotting results demonstrate that RP1 P-PMO is effective in blocking RTA protein expression in BCBL-1 cells in a dose-responsive and sequence-specific manner, as the control P-PMO CP1 and mRP1 had no effect. There remained faint RTA protein expression in BCBL-1 cells treated with 16 \u03bcM RP1, which suggests that some cells achieved little or no uptake of P-PMO or that an insufficient quantity of P-PMO made its way into the subcellular locations where RTA mRNA is translated.

These results demonstrate that KSHV lytic replication was abrogated in BCBL-1 cells after RTA P-PMO application. This pattern of RTA preeminence in the events of lytic progression is consistent with previous publications (Curreli et al., 2002, Zhu et al., 2004). Curreli et al. (2002) showed that methotrexate, a potent anti-inflammatory agent and an inhibitor of cellular dihydrofolate reductase, reduces the expression of ORF50/RTA and prevents expression of other lytic genes. The mechanism of this action is not known. Zhu et al. showed that a DNA-based external guidance sequence (EGS) that targets RTA mRNA for RNase P-based cleavage was found to be an effective means to suppress KSHV lytic replication in BCBL-1 cells, despite its limited transfection efficiency (Zhu et al., 2004).

Cidofovir and foscarnet have no effect on expression of latent or early lytic genes (Curreli et al., 2002), as these drugs are inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase, and transcription of early lytic genes occurs before DNA replication in KSHV.

The arrows and the numbers in bold font above arrows indicate open reading frames. The numbers above the transcript lines indicate nucleotide positions in the KSHV genomic sequence (Russo et al., 1996). The sizes of the latent transcripts are indicated above each line.

The cell nuclei were counterstained blue by 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in mounting solution (Molecular Probes). The lower image panel was taken from the same observed fields as the upper panel, but with a DAPI filter to reveal all cells.

(B) Western blot analysis showing dose-responsive inhibition of RTA expression. The same blot was incubated with an anti-tubulin antibody as a protein loading control. RTA signal after TPA induction in BCBL-1 cells was reduced with increasing RP1 concentration, while CP1 did not cause a detectable change. Mock-treated cells were included in the experiment for comparison. (C) Quantitative image analysis confirmed the dose-responsive inhibition of RTA expression by RP1. RTA expression in cells treated with P-PMO is shown as a relative percentage to that of the mock-treated control. (D) Flow cytometry analysis. The number of RTA-positive cells after P-PMO treatment is shown as a percentage of the total cells counted. The average of three tests is shown and the error bar represents variation among experiments. The cells treated with RP1 had a significantly lower number of RTA-positive cells (P < 0.001) in comparison to cells CP1- or mock-treated. (E) Treatment of BCBL-1 cells with a 5 base-change mutant form of RP1 (mRP1) yielded no detectable change in RTA expression by Western blot analysis.
