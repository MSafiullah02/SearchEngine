            "text": "The disease ecology model attributes spatial variations in disease to three major variables: environment, genetics, and behavior. Environment includes not just the physical environment of livelihood, environmental pollution (e.g., indoor pollution such as radon), and water quality, but also the socioeconomic environment, including relative deprivation, healthcare quality and access, land mines, and the political\u2013economic context. For example, low vaccination rates anywhere produce higher rates of vaccine-preventable diseases in those locations. Genetic predisposition is important particularly for noncommunicable diseases. People with light skin pigmentation are more prone to skin cancer than are others with a darker pigmentation. Similarly, recent research suggests that Ashkenazi Jewish women have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to other women. The human genome project is not only identifying genes responsible for serious diseases such as Parkinson but also developing effective therapies for them. Human behavior is the final component in the disease ecology model. Put simply, behavior facilitates or inhibits disease. Unhealthy behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption, overeating and failure to exercise, unsafe sexual practices, and smoking are associated with various diseases. In contrast, regular exercise and other positive health behaviors, including proper diet, enhance health and prevent disease. Thus, spatial variations in Africa's environment and cultural practices, including widespread poverty, poor healthcare resources with limited access to antiretrovirals, and unsafe burial practices, combine with other factors to produce the highest risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS and Ebola in the world. Similarly, variations exist between and within countries.",

Despite massive efforts, total eradication continues to be an elusive goal. The global campaign to eradicate polio by 2005 suffered a severe setback when parts of northern Nigeria rejected the polio vaccine because Muslim clerics claimed that it causes infertility and spreads HIV/AIDS and cancer. From those few states, polio spread through large parts of the country, neighboring countries, and eventually to Saudi Arabia through Nigerian Muslims on pilgrimage to Mecca. Indonesian Muslims, who were exposed during their pilgrimage in Mecca, carried the disease with them to Indonesia where it became reestablished.

Two people with identical or matching isolates indicate recent transmission from a common source; unique isolates indicate remote transmission from a different source. Analyzing and mapping these genotypes allows researchers to distinguish between not just disease species (phenotype) but also locate areas with high incidence and different strains of the disease, including recent versus remote transmission of disease. Areas with high rates of clustered genotypes indicate ongoing transmission (i.e., an outbreak), whereas multiple unique isolates indicate infections that were acquired elsewhere (are imported).",

Because it assumed that persons with clustered strains of disease from geographically related areas represent ongoing community transmission that can be identified and interrupted through treatment, the study focused resources on zip codes with high incidence and clustered isolates. During the 28-month intervention, the number of cases of TB decreased from 28.5 cases per 1000 screenings to 2.4 cases per 1000. The rate of developing latent TB infection fell from 14.3 to 2.2 per 100 person-years of exposure. The intervention was successful because it distinguished between high incidence areas with high and low levels of clustered strains and deployed resources not just on the basis of incidence but on the basis of genotype. Since unique isolates represent remote transmission, location-based screening in areas with high rates of unique isolates would be less likely to identify either persons with active TB or recent acquired latent TB infection and thus not as cost-effective.
