Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1]. As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations. ",

However, radiation could be measured, whereas the level of penetration of the virus is not measurable.

Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high. ",

SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.",

Four \u2018major transmission complexes\u2019 (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a ~0.3%\u20130.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%\u20132.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.

Weibo\u2019s data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24]. Tiki-Toki\u2019s data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina\u2019s data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens\u2019 agony.(b)Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20\u201321, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation;(c)Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people\u2019s interest in different topics available online.",

The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage. They are as follows: Hema Fresh (up by 50% compared to before the virus spread), Miss Fresh (up by 321% compared to January 2019), Dingdong Maicai (up by 300% from December 2019), and Jing dong Daojia (up by 470% compared to January 2019).

At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities;China\u2019s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic;China is already, and rightfully, working to bolster its economy, reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society, even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission.",

To keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects. China\u2019s mobile network and big data system was able to create the QR code-screening of people, which can be considered a significant achievement. As mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, WHO DG has termed this virus spread as infodemic; having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures. At an early stage, The Supreme Court\u2019s directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic. The \u201cRumors exposed website\u201d created by Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively. Whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies, quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities. At the village level, local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases. At an early stage, data management was an issue, but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government, strict data management measures were put into place. In this case, strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data. The current case needs a science based solutions with local action [28].",

As per [30], governments will not be able to minimize deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put measures in place to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have a spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact [30]. ",
