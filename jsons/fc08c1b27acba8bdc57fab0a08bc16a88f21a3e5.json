It allows public health protection measures such as contact tracing and isolation to be put in place. This study aimed to find the most appropriate surveillance method for a disease like SARS. Existing surveillance methods were evaluated against a set of new criteria in a qualitative manner. Influenza and tuberculosis (TB) surveillance were used as models. A literature search was undertaken to find relevant evidence. The results show that TB surveillance is more appropriate than influenza surveillance as a model because it is more complete in its reporting. Clinician-based reporting is better than laboratory-based because it is more timely.

Effective surveillance systems are necessary for the management of epidemics in order to apply health protection measures. The impact of SARS worldwide was significant both in terms of human and economic cost. There were 8098 cases worldwide and 774 people died. 1 The total economic loss has been estimated as up to $10 billion in Asia alone 2 with significant economic disruption of badly affected countries. Although the outbreak was eventually identified and brought under control, the possibility of further outbreaks must still be considered. 3 SARS is not the only respiratory infection to emerge rapidly and have a significant global impact. The influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957 and 1968 caused large numbers of deaths. 4 The latest outbreak of avian influenza in Asia has caused global public health concern. In this era of mass international travel and large population migration, the management of emerging infection becomes increasingly relevant to UK health systems. To deal with this issue successfully, we need effective surveillance systems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 345, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 630, "end": 631, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 810, "end": 811, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The United Kingdom had no definite surveillance system for SARS or other novel respiratory infection when the outbreak began. A voluntary reporting system was rapidly set up for all suspected, probable and confirmed cases of SARS in the United Kingdom, 5 but questions were asked on what surveillance methods are necessary to deal with this condition, or any like it, in the future. The health spokesman for the Opposition suggested that SARS should be made a notifiable disease. 6 The Chief Medical Officer considered this move, 7 but decided to continue with the voluntary clinical reporting system. The HPA produced an option appraisal inviting comment on this issue. 8 In order to be systematic in assessing surveillance methods, it would be useful to have a set of criteria to evaluate the choices. This paper describes a set of criteria that were constructed which we believe are important for the effective surveillance of a disease like SARS.
