            "text": "Febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common serious bacterial infection in children [1\u20133]. Febrile UTI can occur simultaneously with a respiratory tract infection, but the likelihood of UTI has been reported to be significantly lower among respiratory virus-positive than in virus-negative febrile infants [4, 5]. Highly sensitive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and other nucleic acid amplification tests with short turnaround times are currently widely used in hospitals and emergency departments (EDs) for detecting respiratory viruses. However, positive results must be interpreted with caution since certain respiratory viruses, like rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human bocavirus, are frequently detected also in asymptomatic children [6]. In addition to rapid and sensitive virus detection methods, a biomarker of host response to respiratory virus infection could be useful in the evaluation of febrile infants.",

It has been studied as a potential biomarker of symptomatic viral infections due to its broad antiviral range, rapid induction in 1 to 2 h after onset of symptoms, and low basal levels in healthy children [9, 10]. Blood MxA protein levels are markedly elevated in symptomatic viral infections but not in respiratory virus-positive asymptomatic children [7]. MxA response has not been extensively studied in very young infants or in children with coinciding viral and bacterial infections. In a study of acute pharyngitis, elevated blood MxA levels were found in children coinfected with a respiratory virus and group A streptococcus but not in children with only group A streptococcus infection [11].",

The inclusion criteria were (1) age between 4 weeks and 16 years, (2) admission to hospital, and (3) blood bacterial culture drawn by the decision of the attending clinician. An exclusion criterion was cancer under active treatment. For the current analysis, we included study children with a diagnosis of febrile UTI. Data on symptoms and recently administered vaccines were collected by parent-filled structured questionnaires and from the electronic registries of well-baby clinics. Documentation of respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, cough) was based on parental questionnaire and on clinical examination at the ED.

Our results emphasize the high detection rate of respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR tests in nasopharyngeal samples of children with febrile UTI and show the potential of blood MxA protein as a biomarker of a symptomatic viral infection.",

Earlier studies have investigated the risk of serious bacterial infection in febrile infants with or without respiratory virus infection. The presence of a respiratory virus infection has been reported to reduce the probability of UTI among febrile infants in comparison with virus-negative children [4, 5], but there are differences between viruses in this regard. The risk of concomitant UTI in infants with respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus infection, detected either by PCR or by an antigen test, is lower than the risk in virus-negative children [12\u201314]. On the contrary, in another study, the probability of UTI was not substantially lower in rhinovirus-positive compared with virus-negative infants [14].",

The perception that virus positivity reduces the risk of UTI or other serious bacterial infection possibly does not apply if febrile children are systematically tested with broad multiplex PCR panels. Our results of frequent respiratory virus findings with or without respiratory symptoms in children with UTI support this view. As expected by its frequency in all young children [15], rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus. Our results call for diagnostic stewardship in terms of whom to test for respiratory viruses by using highly multiplexed, sensitive diagnostic assays. If multiplex PCR is routinely used in febrile children in the ED, blood MxA protein could serve as a useful biomarker for a symptomatic viral infection.",

We did not find any large differences in MxA levels in infants below the age of 12 months compared to older children when those with respiratory symptoms were excluded. This is consistent with our previous study, in which we found higher baseline levels of blood MxA protein in children compared to adults but similar levels at ages 2 and 13 months [7]. It is important to consider the role of rotavirus or other live virus vaccinations in studies of MxA protein or other interferon-inducible proteins in children, as live vaccines can increase blood MxA levels temporarily [7, 16]. However, recent rotavirus vaccination had only minor effect on blood MxA protein levels in the present study, similarly to our earlier observations [7]. We also earlier reported that febrile respiratory infections were associated with substantially higher blood MxA levels than infections without fever [7]. The current study included febrile children only, and although the cause of fever was presumably UTI in most children, some children may have been febrile because of a simultaneous viral infection. This could have affected the blood MxA levels in children with no apparent respiratory symptoms.",
