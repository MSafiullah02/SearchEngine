We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I\u00b2 statistics, and assessment of study quality.",

            "text": "Findings 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12\u00b72 years (SD 4\u00b71) to 68\u00b70 years (single case report). Studies were from Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27\u00b79%; 95% CI 20\u00b75-36\u00b70] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32\u00b76%; 24\u00b77-40\u00b79] of 129), anxiety (46 [35\u00b77%; 27\u00b76-44\u00b72] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34\u00b71%; 26\u00b72-42\u00b75] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41\u00b79%; 22\u00b75-50\u00b75] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0\u00b77%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10\u00b75%; 95% CI 7\u00b75-14\u00b71] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12\u00b71%; 8\u00b76-16\u00b73] of 280), anxiety (21 [12\u00b73%; 7\u00b77-17\u00b77] of 171), irritability (28 [12\u00b78%; 8\u00b77-17\u00b76] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18\u00b79%; 14\u00b71-24\u00b72] of 233), fatigue (61 [19\u00b73%; 15\u00b71-23\u00b79] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30\u00b74%; 23\u00b79-37\u00b73] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100\u00b70%; 88\u00b70-100\u00b70] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32\u00b72% (95% CI 23\u00b77-42\u00b70; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14\u00b79% (12\u00b71-18\u00b72; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14\u00b78% (11\u00b71-19\u00b74; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76\u00b79%; 95% CI 68\u00b71-84\u00b76) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35\u00b73 months (SD 40\u00b71). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

            "text": "Viral infections are common and some are known to infect the CNS, causing neuropsychiatric syndromes affecting cognitive, affective, behavioural, and perceptual domains. [1] [2] [3] Severe illness of diverse aetiologies is associated with subsequent psychiatric morbidity, at least some of which is attributable to its psychological impact of trauma. [4] [5] [6] Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses and several subtypes affecting humans have been identified, most of which cause mild upper respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent individuals (notably, the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 strains). 7, 8 Coronaviruses have also been detected in both the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with seizures, encephalitis, and encephalomyelitis. 9 Novel strains of coronavirus caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, starting in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak, starting in 2012. 8 On Dec 31, 2019, WHO was made aware of several cases of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China, which were subsequently identified as being caused by a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 10 panel). As the pandemic of the disease now known as COVID-19 has spread, there has been a growing recognition of the psychiatric implications of the disease. 13, 14 There are several reasons why the current COVID-19 pandemic might have psychiatric consequences. Some of these reasons relate to the wider social impact of the pandemic and the governmental response, including physical distancing measures and quarantine. 15, 16 Both the infected and non-infected population might be susceptible as a result of certain experiences, such as widespread anxiety, 17 social isolation, 16 stress in health-care workers and other essential workers, 18 and unemployment and financial difficulties. 19 Other experiences might be specific to individuals who are infected with the virus, such as concern about the outcome of their illness, 20 stigma, 21 and amnesia or traumatic memories of severe illness. 22 Neuropsychiatric consequences-ie, mental disorders that are the sequelae of brain damage or disease-can arise either through direct effects of infection of the CNS or indirectly via an immune response or medical therapy. A case series from Wuhan found that among patients admitted to hospital for infection with SARS-CoV-2, 36% had neurological features, mostly consisting of mild symptoms such as dizziness and headache, although these symptoms might be mani festations more of systemic illness than a specific neurological syndrome. 23 Some patients had acute cerebrovascular disease or impaired consciousness as part of their illness. 23 SARS-CoV-2 enters human host cells by the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor, which has little expression",

The effect size measures were prevalence with 95% CIs (for number of signs or symptoms, quality of life scores, and employment) and mean difference with 95% CIs (for symptom severity and pro portion of diagnoses). We define d point prevalences for number of psychiatric symptoms, proportion of diagnoses (defined by ICD-10, DSM-IV, or Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders [third edition] criteria or by validated psychometric scales with established cutoffs), and proportion of patients in employment as the proportion of cases over the sample size. 30 For studies using cutoff scores on symptom rating scales, this percentage represents the presence of clinically signifi cant symptoms reflected by the number of patients scoring above the defined cutoff. We also synthesised prevalences for individuals admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and undergoing mechanical ventilation for each coronavirus subtype for comparability. We used mean difference for symptom severity and quality-of-life outcomes, with negative values indexing lower symptom severity and higher quality of life, and positive values indexing higher symptom severity and lower quality of life, in patients with coronavirus infection than among healthy controls. Where continuous data (ie, symptom scores and quality of life) did not have a sufficient number of studies reporting suitable control group data to produce mean differences, we calculated sample size-weighted mean scores for all the studies reporting data alongside 95% CIs in addition to any potential meta-analytical summary effect. We calculated I\u00b2 as a measure of between-study heterogeneity. We did not assess funnel plot asymmetry because of an insufficient number of studies. 31 Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the contribution of individual studies for the meta-analyses of diagnoses. Data were analysed using R (version 3.3.2) and the meta package (version 4.11) for prevalence data, and RevMan Web (version 5.3) for continuous outcomes.

Seven studies (including four preprints) were from Wuhan and reported data from at least 575 unique cases. Another three preprints described 343 cases from Chongqing and Zhejiang in China, and Hong Kong. Two preprints used rating scales to systematically assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. 96, 97 In one study, 96 50 (35%) of 144 patients had symptoms of anxiety and 41 (28%) had symptoms of depression, although these assessments were not diagnostic. In the other study, 97 26 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with patients with other forms of pneumonia and agematched and sex-matched healthy controls; scores on both the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale were higher for the SARS-CoV-2 group than for either of the other groups, but these scores improved significantly after the first week of their hospital stay.",

It also reported confusion in 26 (65%) of 40 patients who were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Some patients had neuropsychiatric investigations including brain MRI (13 [22%] of 58 patients), electroencephalogram (EEG; eight [14%] patients), and lumbar puncture (seven [12%] patients). MRI demon strated larger leptomeningeal spaces in eight (62%) of 13 patients as well as two recent asymptomatic ischaemic strokes. EEG changes were non-specific, with diffuse bifrontal slowing consistent with encephalopathy described in one of eight patients. Of seven patients who had lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid analysis identified oligoclonal bands in two patients and elevated protein and IgG in another. At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome with symp toms such as inattention, disorientation, or poorly organised movements in response to command. 61 The only other systematic assessment of neuropsychiatric presentations was from a preprint 98 that found altered consciousness to be present in 17 (21%) of 82 patients with COVID-19 who subsequently died. Overall, altered consciousness or encephalopathy was reported in five studies. 23, 62, 98, 99 Four other studies (two preprints) reported cases of confusion or disturbance of consciousness, although not systematically, with prevalence ranging between 2\u00b70% (95% CI 0\u00b74-10\u00b75) and 22\u00b72% (11\u00b77-38\u00b71). 63, [99] [100] [101] In terms of neuropsychiatric features of specific neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was one report of meningitis-encephalitis and two cases where hypoxic encephalopathy was specified in peerreviewed studies. 62, 64 Overall, for the 65 peer-reviewed studies, 32 were deemed to be of low quality, 30 were deemed to be of moderate quality, and three were deemed to be of high quality. Two preprints were of low quality, four moderate quality, and one was high quality. Across studies, the main weaknesses were due to limited assessment of preinfection psychiatric symptoms and the lack of adequate comparison groups. Results of the study quality assessment are described in the appendix (pp [18] [19] [20] .",

We identified 72 independent studies that provided data on both the acute and post-illness psychiatric and neuropsychiatric features of coronavirus infection, including seven medRxiv preprints. The scientific literature predominantly consists of data on patients with SARS and MERS treated in hospital, so there should be caution in generalising any findings to COVID-19, particularly for patients who have mild symptoms. Our main findings are that signs suggestive of delirium are common in the acute stage of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19; there is evidence of depression, In SARS and MERS in the acute stage, using data from two studies, the most important finding was that confusion occurred in 27\u00b79% of patients, suggesting that delirium was common. Other common psychiatric findings were depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Diagnoses of mania and psychosis did occur in a small minority (0\u00b77%), but in a small sample this diagnosis appeared to be almost entirely related to use of exogenous corticosteroids, which are rarely prescribed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, insomnia, emotional lability, irritability, pressured speech, and euphoria were relatively common, suggesting that although a full syndrome of mania was uncommon, subthreshold symptoms might be present.",

            "text": "In SARS and MERS, after recovery from the infection, sleep disorder, frequent recall of traumatic memories, emotional lability, impaired concentration, fatigue, and impaired memory were reported in more than 15% of patients at a follow-up period ranging between 6 weeks and 39 months. Emotional lability, pressured speech, and euphoria were only reported by patients and relatives after a short follow-up (mean 42 days [range ) in one study 43 in which corticosteroids had frequently been prescribed at high doses and symptoms; therefore, it might be of limited relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic. The point prevalences of anxiety disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder were high, although the lack of adequate comparison groups or assessment of previous psychiatric disorder means that it is hard to separate the effects of the infection from the impact of an epidemic on the population as a whole or the possibility that selection bias led to the high prevalence figures. In terms of severity, mean scores for depression and anxiety on standard scales were below clinical cutoffs. Measures of health-related quality of life were considerably lower in patients with SARS than in control groups. However, the impairment in social functioning was greater than the effects on mental health (appendix p 11), suggesting that the effect of coronaviruses is broad and not specific to mental health. Some positive effects in terms of personal growth during adversity were noted. In terms of applicability to COVID-19, conclusions must be cautious because data on the acute effects of the illness are limited and no data exist on the post-illness phase, and the higher mortality of SARS and MERS might be correlated with poorer psychiatric outcomes. 11, 105 The information available suggests that in the acute stage-as in SARS and MERS-confusion is a common feature, so delirium is probably a significant clinical problem. In the longer term, the data from SARS and MERS suggest that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fatigue might be high, but as yet data on these diagnoses in patients with COVID-19 are preliminary or unpublished. In patients with severe illness requiring ICU admission, neurocognitive impairment might be a feature. We found only three cases of SARS-CoV-2-related psychiatric symptoms that were explicitly linked to hypoxic or encephalitic brain injury; this finding is consistent with the rarity of case reports that have associated detection of coronaviruses in the CNS with acute encephalitis or encephalomyelitis (mainly in immunocompromised or immunodeficient children). [106] [107] [108] The aetiology of the psychiatric consequences of infection with coronavirus is likely to be multifactorial and might include the direct effects of viral infection (including brain infection), cerebrovascular disease (including in the context of a procoagulant state), the degree of physiological compromise (eg, hypoxia), the immuno logical response, medical interventions, social isolation, the psychological impact of a novel severe and potentially fatal illness, concerns about infecting others, and stigma. The immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection is of interest and there might be a hyper inflammatory state similar to that seen in haemo phagocytic lympho histicytosis in which there are increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleukin-6, although this state is likely to be short lived. 109 The link between inflammation and depression is well described and might explain some of the psychiatric morbidity. 110 Survivors of critical illness are at risk of persistent psychiatric impairment after discharge from hospital. At 1 year, the pooled prevalences of clinically relevant depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms were 29% (23-34), 4 34% (25-42), 5 and 34% (22-50), 6 respectively. The majority of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, a key feature of severe COVID-19 illness, show impairments of memory, attention, concentration, or mental processing speed at 1 year. 111 None of the studies included in this review completed systematic neuropsychological assessments apart from one report of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases, which described a dysexecutive syndrome in a third of survivors. 61 Acute respiratory distress syndrome and prolonged mechanical ventilation are also associated with greater reductions in quality of life than ICU admissions for other reasons. 112 Limitations include the use of preprint articles that have not been subject to peer review, exclusion of non-Englishlanguage articles, and the inclusion of studies with very small samples. A further limitation was that most studies were of low or moderate quality. Almost all of the studies we included in this review reported outcomes from patients admitted to hospital, which improves the comparability between coronavirus infections. However, although the frequencies of ICU admission and ventilation were similar for patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV infection (13% ICU admission and 7% ventilation) and SARS-CoV-2 (18% and 6%), they were considerably higher in patients with MERS (60% and 51%). Systematic assess ment of psychiatric symptoms was rare, use of selfreport questionnaires was common, and there was variation in the definition of illness and laboratory verification of infection between studies. The lack of baseline psychiatric assessments means that accurate estimates of incidence are impossible; therefore, we relied on point prevalence where possible. Few studies included objective biological measures, such as peripheral blood markers of genetic, inflammatory, immune, and metabolic function, cerebrospinal fluid measures, EEG, or brain imaging. Furthermore, few studies included comparison groups. The apparently high prevalence of common symptoms reported (such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue) could have been unrelated to the coronavirus infection and rather a consequence of selection bias. For the post-illness studies, there was substantial variation in follow-up time that hindered comparability. These factors might have contributed to heterogeneity, but there were too few studies to explore explanations of this variance.",
