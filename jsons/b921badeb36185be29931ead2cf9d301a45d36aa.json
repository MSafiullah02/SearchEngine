We make that assumption here. This assumption would be violated by biased selection of transmission pairs for sampling. For example if the infector being in a later, symptomatic stage of infection makes identification of the pair more likely, then a data set of identified pairs will be undersampled for pre-symptomatic exposure and will overestimate the typical generation time. The next step in solving the model was calculating the relative scaling constant of the environmental contribution to \u03b2(\u03c4 ) to give the required R E /R 0 , and finally the overall scaling constant of \u03b2(\u03c4 ) is determined to reproduce the observed exponential growth rate.",

This approach can be modified to include environmental transmission as well. The timing of environmentally mediated transmission is shifted to slightly later in the infection (larger \u03c4 ) due to the waiting time of the virus in the environment in between hosts, i.e. due to the function E(l) discussed earlier not being a delta function concentrated at zero. However as an approximation for analytical tractability, to derive the effect of the intervention we neglect this shift in timing i.e. we neglect the viral waiting time in the environment compared to the range of \u03c4 values over which \u03b2(\u03c4 ) is spread. With this approximation, environmental transmission events can be treated as cases of untraceable transmission. Isolation and quarantine are effective in preventing environmental spread, since they stop the infected individual from releasing the virus in the environment. (The only relevant exception is environment transmission within isolation facilities, which is not prevented by isolation -quite the opposite.) We assume here that all environmental transmission events correspond simply to untraceable transmissions, and that the rate of viral shedding in the environment is proportional to the person-to-person infectiousness. Then, the theory developed above can be applied by replacing the efficacy of contact tracing T \u2192 T (1 \u2212 R e /R 0 ), where the factor 1 \u2212 R e /R 0 corresponds to the fraction of traceable transmissions and T is the efficacy per traceable transmission.

Both of these are anti-correlated with the R A and R S at the tails of the distributions because the sum of all four contributions is constrained (to R 0 ) by the observed r and w(\u03c4 ). There is little correlation between R S and the overall R 0 .

The solid black line is such a contour for our central estimate of R 0 for SARS-CoV-2, namely R 0 = 2; this line therefore shows the threshold for epidemic control. The dashed lines show the contours of the upper and lower bounds of the CI for R 0 (1.7 -2.5), i.e. these indicate one source of uncertainty in the epidemic control threshold.
