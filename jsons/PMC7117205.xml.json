            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a destructive infectious disease which has broken out in China and some other Asian and Western countries. It has arisen significant economic and public health concerns (Sun et al., 2016; Stevenson et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018). PED is caused by Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) which is seen as an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus. The PEDV genome is composed of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs): ORF 1a/1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and a 3\u2032UTR in order (Egberink et al., 1988). Consistent with pathological changes in vivo, PEDV infection could induce morphological and biochemical changes in host cells and some cell lines in vitro such as IPEC-J2 and Vero and Marc-145 (Kim and Lee, 2014; Zhao et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2018). Previous studies have reported that PEDV induces apoptotic cell death via a mitochondrial AIF-mediated pathway (Kim and Lee, 2014) and it is S1 protein obtained from PEDV that induces apoptosis in Vero cells (Chen et al., 2018). However, little is known about the upstream signalling in PEDV-induced apoptosis. Further studies are needed to clarify which upstream signalling mechanisms are activated and involved in the regulation of apoptotic signalling pathways during PEDV infection.",

            "text": "The tumour-suppressor protein 53 (p53), a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, is established as transcription factor that regulates cell processes such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis and ferroptosis (Gao et al., 2016; Laptenko and Prives, 2006). In normal conditions, p53 is stabilised at low levels by a series of regulators such as MDM2, which works as a ubiquitin ligase to help degradation of p53, whereas these processes become altered under cell stress (Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017). In response to stimulation, p53 is activated and is transferred into the nucleus in a phosphorylated form to regulate transcription of target genes (B\u00e1lint and Vousden, 2001). The best-understood function of p53 is its ability to promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017). Our previous research showed that p53 was involved in PEDV-induced Vero cell arrest, indicating that p53 may play a vital role in the mechanism of PEDV infection (Sun et al., 2018). Moreover, relying on the induction of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and FasL family, p53 plays an essential role in viral infection induced apoptosis. Similar examples can be found in Canine Influenza Virus H3N2-infected MDCK cells (Zhou et al., 2017), Novel H7N9 Influenza A Virus-infected A549 cells (Yan et al., 2016) and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus-infected PK-15 cells (Huang et al., 2013). However, whether p53 participates in PEDV-induced apoptosis and the mechanism of how it impacts on apoptosis remains unclear.",

            "text": "Reaction oxygen species (ROS) are known toxic products in cellular metabolism. They are mainly produced by the mitochondria in most mammalian cells, act as signalling molecules, and are involved in oxidative stress during a variety of viral infections (Hamanaka and Chandel, 2010). Cells maintain a balance of ROS by means of the antioxidant system in physiological conditions (Torres et al., 2006). However, triggered by stress stimuli such as ionising radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs and viral infections, ROS can be excessively accumulated and regulate several pathological processes including proliferation, inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis (Circu and Aw, 2010; Miyata et al., 2017). Several studies showed that ROS participate in apoptosis induced by viruses. For example, parvovirus H-1 infection induces apoptosis via mediating ROS accumulation (Hristov et al., 2010). PPV infection induces ST cells apoptosis via activation of ROS generation and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signalling (Zhao et al., 2016). ROS have also been implicated in some important apoptotic signalling pathways, such as p38 MAPK and p53 pathways (Fuh et al., 2002; Hamanaka and Chandel, 2010). For instance, during Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection induced HL-CZ apoptosis, GRP78, p-ERK and p38 were activated and ROS were produced, suggesting JEV may induce apoptosis via the ERK/p38-ROS pathway (Tung et al., 2010). Treatment with 6-sho and TRAIL induced apoptosis via p53 and ROS (Nazim and Park, 2018). ROS act as important mediators that cooperate with molecular signals and participate in apoptotic signal transduction, which are consistent with the reports aforementioned. Therefore, the roles of ROS and p53 in the induction of apoptosis in PEDV-infected Vero cell lines were investigated.",

Treatment with p53-specific inhibitors reversed PEDV-induced apoptosis both in the expression of apoptosis-related protein levels and the number of apoptotic cells, suggesting p53 plays a dominant role in PEDV-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ROS were found to be produced during this period and are closely related to apoptosis. However, activated p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK played a limited role in PEDV-induced apoptosis.

To elucidate the mechanism of p53 in PEDV-induced apoptosis, the expressions of p53 and relative proteins were measured by western blot. From Fig. 3\nA and B, phosphorylated p53 at serine 20 was significantly increased at 6 h post infection compared with mock infection, and with time, p-p53(Ser20) protein level accumulated constantly, whereas p-p53(Ser15) protein levels showed no significant changes compared with the corresponding mock infection points. Interestingly, compared with mock infection, total p53 levels decreased from 18 h p.i. in PEDV infection, whereas p-p53(Ser46) protein levels showed no significant changes compared with mock infection at each time of post infection measurement and p-p53(Ser46) protein levels constantly decreased over time. Although p53 at early infection stages had no evident changes in PEDV-infected cells, its relative proteins such as p300, MDM2, CBP showed a variety of change trends in every time point of post infection(Fig. 3C and D). MDM2 increased from 6 h p.i. and continuously increased until 18 h p.i. CBP had significantly higher levels of protein at 18 h p.i. and 24 h p.i., whereas p300 increased from 0 h p.i. to 12 h p.i. and decreased from 12 h p.i. to 24 h p.i. compared with the corresponding mock infection points. These results showed that the expression of p300 increased from 6 h p.i. and peaked by 12 h p.i. and were followed by a steady decline from 12 to 24 h p.i. PEDV infection upregulated MDM2 and CBP, which might work together to cause a decrease in steady-state p53 abundance and p53 half-life in infected cells.",

Next, we investigated the relative expression of apoptotic proteins such as FasL, Bax and Bcl-2 induced by PEDV infection under PFT-\u03b1 treatment. Pre-incubation of Vero cells with PFT-\u03b1 in PEDV infection could evidently down-regulate Bax, upregulate Bcl-2 in protein levels, and significantly decrease the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in PEDV-infected Vero cells determined by Western blot assay (Fig. 4C and D). FasL protein levels were not affected by PEDV or PFT-\u03b1 (Fig. 4C and E), suggesting FasL was not associated with the p53 pathway and PEDV induced apoptosis. Further inhibitor experiments should be measured by flow cytometry. Consequently, PFT-a treatment significantly decreased PEDV-induced apoptosis in Vero cells (Fig. 4F and G).

In this part, inhibitor experiments were carried out to clarify the relationships between two key signals. Firstly, p53 and p-p53(Ser20) were observed under the condition that cells were pre-processed with PDTC and NAC and then infected with PEDV. PDTC and NAC suppressed the expression of p53 compared with PEDV-infected cells, and treatment with the two antioxidants at same time could increase the expression level of p53. This phenomenon suggested that PEDV and antioxidants may participate in the regulation of p53 expression in a mutually antagonistic manner (Fig. 7\nA and B). The expression of p-p53(Ser20) significantly increased in PDTC and NAC treatment in PEDV infection compared with PEDV-infected cells without antioxidants treatment, furthermore, cells treated with two antioxidants at the same time showed a slightly decreased protein levels (Fig. 7A and C).",

To present the change rate of ROS more clearly, relative ROS level histograms were constructed and showed there was no significant change with PFT-\u03b1 treatment (Fig. 7F), indicating ROS accumulation caused by PEDV infection was not affected by PFT-\u03b1 treatment.

Increasing evidence has shown that activated p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK participated in regulation of p53 and ROS-mediated apoptosis (Dabiri et al., 2018; Lan et al., 2017; Shang et al., 2017). Therefore, we determined the effect of PEDV infection on the p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK signal pathways in Vero cells. The results showed that phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-SAPK/JNK were triggered by PEDV infection. Compared with mock infection, the protein expression remained at a high level after PEDV infection (Fig. 8\nA and B), indicating p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK can be activated during PEDV infection. Next, the specific inhibitors SB203580 and SP600125 were used to block the expression of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK, to observe whether p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK were involved in PEDV-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 8C\u2013E, the inhibitors worked well in our system. The ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, however, exhibited had little change following inhibitor treatment compared with the non-treated PEDV-infected cells, suggesting suppression of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK was unable to prevent apoptosis caused by PEDV infection (Fig. 8C and F). Our data indicated that the p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK signalling pathways are not linked to PEDV-mediated apoptosis.",

Extensive outbreaks have occurred in the United States since 2013, and have caused significant economic costs to livestock breeding (Stevenson et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016). However, the pathogenesis of PEDV has not yet been fully clarified and further research is needed. Apoptosis, a programmed cell death process that occurs in a variety of differentiated cells, is to protect organism from damage induced by stimulation (Elmore, 2007). It is important to note that the relationship between viral infection and cell apoptosis is bidirectional. In response to viral infections, induction of apoptosis in infected cells can prevent viral replication, dissemination or persistent viral infection of the cell to protect organisms from further damage. During infection by some virues, host cells acquire resistance to apoptosis and survive for a long time which benefits viral replication. Important findings have indicated that PEDV induces apoptotic cell death via the mitochondrial AIF-mediated pathway (Kim and Lee, 2014) and it is the S1 protein obtained from PEDV that induces apoptosis in Vero cells (Chen et al., 2018). However, little is known about the changes of upstream signals such as ROS and p53 in PEDV-induced apoptosis. Also, it is unclear whether these signalling changes are caused by the direct or indirect effects of apoptosis and how these signals are regulated remains to be confirmed in Vero cells. In this study, we firstly demonstrated that PEDV infection induced apoptosis in Vero cells via activation of the p53-mediated pathway and that PEDV-induced intracellular ROS accumulation was involved in promoting apoptosis.",

            "text": "Regulation of cell apoptosis involves the activation of many cell signalling pathways (Barber, 2001). p53 signalling is involved in different essential cellular events and functions, such as the cell cycle, cell differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation in specific cell types upon different stresses (Laptenko and Prives, 2006). In coronaviruses, we previously found that PEDV, through the p53-dependent pathway, causes cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase in Vero cells (Sun et al., 2018), which was similar to the behaviour observed with MHV in mouse fibroblast 17Cl-1 cells (Chen et al., 2004). Porcine parvovirus infection induces apoptosis in PK-15 cells through activation of p53 and mitochondria-mediated pathway (Zhang et al., 2015) SARS-CoV 3a protein causes p38 MAPK-mediated upregulation of p53, which plays an important role in 3a protein-mediated apoptosis (Mizutani et al., 2004). In the present study, PEDV infection promoted expression of p53 phosphorylation at serine 20 from 6 h p.i. to 24 h p.i. at a high level, which was similar to the trends of MDM2, whilst CBP accumulated from 18 h p.i. to 24 h p.i., indicating phosphorylated p53 was triggered under PEDV infection. The expression of total p53 was steady before 12 h p.i. and declined slightly from 18 h p.i. to 24 h p.i.. Similarly, indirect immunofluorescence assay results showed p53 gathered in the nucleus gradually whilst the fluorescence intensity changed little with prolonged infection time. The expression of p300 increased from 6 h p.i. and peaked at 12 h p.i. This was followed by a steady decline from 12 to 24 h p.i., which may be due to the different roles and effects of virus and host cells at different regulation patterns in the p53 signalling pathway. These data suggest that p53 and relative protein regulation is a complex process in virus-infected cells. Bcl-2 family members are known to be important gatekeepers of apoptotic responses (Bao, 1996; Carpio et al., 2015; Tang and Wu, 2016). Bcl-2 family members are classified into the following three functional groups: Anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2, pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax, and pro-apoptotic activators, such as NOXA and PUMA (Carpio et al., 2015; Gallenne et al., 2009). Bcl-2 binds and interacts with Bax to prevent mitochondrial pore formation, which subsequently inhibits the execution of cell apoptosis. Therefore, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio may be used to determine apoptosis (Cory et al., 2003). Here, we observed a significantly decreased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in PEDV infected cells and PFT-\u03b1 was able to reverse the high expression of Bax/Bcl-2. These data suggested the inhibition of p53 could markedly reverse PEDV-induced apoptosis, which has the same results as the inhibition experiments confirmed by flow cytometry.",

In the present study, PEDV disturbed the homeostatic balance between the generation and elimination of ROS, leading to the accumulation of ROS at every corresponding time after infection. Accumulating evidence from some studies has revealed that ROS are related to apoptosis in many viral infections (Hristov et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2016; Tung et al., 2010). Since ROS were accumulated during PEDV infection, further studies should be undertaken to determine whether ROS are related to apoptosis. Therefore, antioxidant treatment of PDTC and NAC was used to test this hypothesis. We found that antioxidants were able to protect cells from PEDV-induced apoptosis regardless of the expression of apoptotic proteins or the number of apoptotic cells, suggesting that ROS plays an important role in the process of PEDV induction in cell apoptosis. However, as the application of antioxidants at the concentrations used in our experiments did not completely protect the cells from apoptosis, it appears that PEDV-induced apoptosis in infected cells may involve other uncharacterised mechanisms acting in parallel with ROS.",

            "text": "In mammalian cells, ROS serve as second messengers that mediate diverse redox-sensitive signalling pathways such as the MAPK and p53 signalling pathways (Bragado et al., 2007). Accumulating evidence supports the notion that either ROS accumulation, the p53 pathway or both may play critical roles in viral-induced apoptosis. Our study has shown that ROS and p53 all participate in PEDV-induced apoptosis, yet their relationships need to be further investigated. In this study, Western blot assays revealed inhibition of ROS could reduce p53 expression whereas treated with two antioxidants at same time and then infected with PEDV, p53 increased indicating PEDV and antioxidants may participate in the regulation of p53 expression in a mutually antagonistic manner. Moreover, results from the DCFH-DA assay suggested that PFT-\u0251 cannot reverse ROS accumulation induced by PEDV infection. MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases that produce intracellular signals in response to various stimuli (Hao et al., 2015). The oxidative stress-dependent activation of MAPKs was found to be involved in the induction of cell apoptosis. Here, we also observed that phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-SAPK/JNK were triggered by PEDV infection and that protein expression remained at a high level after PEDV infection (Fig. 8A and B), indicating p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK can be activated during PEDV infection. However, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 showed little change following inhibitor treatment, in agreement with previous studies (Lee et al., 2016). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the PEDV dependent ROS/p53 mediated pathway induced apoptosis in Vero cells whereas p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK were not involved in apoptosis.",

Thus, to exclude the effect of inhibitors on the toxicity of cells, we tested the inhibitory effect of cells in the presence of inhibitor and antioxidant treatment for 24 h. Results showed that treatment with 10 \u03bcM PFT-\u03b1, 10 \u03bcM SB203580, 10 \u03bcM SP600125, 5 mM NAC and 50 \u03bcM PDTC had no inhibitory effect on cell viability, which indicated that there was no significant influence in cells treated with inhibitor and antioxidant for 24 h.
