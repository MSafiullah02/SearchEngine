Currently, few studies have validated the causal pathways of determinants of health literacy through the use of statistical modeling. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a health literacy model at an individual level that could best explain the determinants of health literacy and the associations between health literacy and health behaviors even health status. Methods: Skill-based health literacy test and a self-administrated questionnaire survey were conducted among 3222 Chinese adult residents. Path analysis was applied to validate the model. Results: The model explained 38.6% of variance for health literacy, 11.7% for health behavior and 2.3% for health status: (GFI = 0.9990; RMR = 0.0521; \u03c7 2 = 10.2151, P = 0.1159). Education has positive and direct effect on prior knowledge (\u03b2 = 0.324) and health literacy (\u03b2 = 0.346). Health literacy is also affected by prior knowledge (\u03b2 = 0.245) and age (\u03b2 = \u22120.361). Health literacy is a direct influencing factor of health behavior (\u03b2 = 0.101). The most important factor of health status is age (\u03b2 = 0.107). Health behavior and health status have a positive interaction effect.",

With a deeper understanding of health literacy in academic circles, more and more researchers find that a lack of health literacy can cause some adverse effects for individuals and society. Low literacy is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality, hospitalization, and in some cases poorer control of chronic health conditions [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Additionally, limited health literacy impacts on the prevention and screening of diseases, health behavior, the taking of patients' history and the interpretation of diagnoses [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Knowing little about preventive care, people with low health literacy tend to use more medicines and more expensive healthcare services, including hospitalization and emergency services [7, 15, 16] .",

The print-prose scale measured the knowledge and skills needed to search, comprehend, and use information from texts that were organized in sentences or paragraphs, while the printdocument scale measured from non-continuous texts in various formats. The print-quantitative scale measured the knowledge and skills needed to identify and perform computations using numbers embedded in printed materials [24] .",

There was, however, a significant difference between the unmarried and married group, but the difference is explainable by age differences.

Highest health literacy scores were seen among students, scientific and technical workers, teachers and doctors. Office workers, service providers, general workers and other workers scored lower, while farmers and retired people scored lower still.

This indicates how important education is for the promotion of health literacy. Education has the same strong effect on prior knowledge, and a further indirect effect on health literacy though prior knowledge.

Therefore, targeting the under-30 age group for the popularization and publicity of health literacy programwhen perception and behavior form and develop stablycan promote their health skills and knowledge, bringing them lifetime benefits. For those aged over 30, health communication and health education must be consolidated due to the downward trend of knowledge and health literacy with aging. Conversely, the study found older age groups' health status was better than that of the younger groups, with the 30-39 age group as the dividing point. This finding is contrary to what other studies have measured. The main reason for this is that the health status category was only concerned with the frequency an individual got a cold and the severity of such sicknesses because it is relatively easier and more feasible to measure the frequency of catching a cold and its severity than other kinds of infectious respiratory diseases. As we know, older people have often developed stronger resistance to these illnesses than younger people. For example, Kumar's review of H1N1 flu shows that the virus is causing critical illnesses mostly in young adults. The researchers concluded that H1N1 (swine flu) primarily affects young adults who are in relatively good health and free of underlying illnesses [27] . Income is the weakest of the three influencing factors in this study. It has only a slight effect on prior knowledge. Usually, those of higher individual incomes own more sources of knowledge. Therefore, the measured negative effect of income on health behavior is an unexpected phenomenon, though the standardized coefficient is very little and the t value of \u22122.1416 is only just significant.

Prior knowledge's effect on health behavior stands to reason, for example in the KAP model [29] . Health behavior and health status are interactional. In Baker's model, health literacy is one of many factors that lead to the acquisition of new knowledge, more positive attitudes, greater self-efficacy, positive health behaviors, and better health outcomes [20] . In von Wagner's model, health outcomes depend on a range of mediating processes, most obviously actions to promote health, prevent disease, or comply with diagnosis and treatment, which the author calls health actions [22] . In Paasche-Orlow and Wolf's 2007 model, they proposed causal pathways between limited health literacy and health outcomes [21] . Their models distinguish three different types of health actions that mediate the impact of health literacy on health: access to and utilization of health care, patient-provider interaction, and self-care. In this study, health behavior mainly focused on self-care and utilization of health care, while health status reflected health outcome. However, health behavior and health status did not show a good relationship. The measurement of health status in this study was conditioned to respiratory infection due to the restriction of the project scope. It is obvious that respiratory infections are influenced by many things, not only individual behavior, but also a variety of biological and social factors. Therefore, the relationship between health behavior and health outcomes, and the effect of health literacy on health outcomes though health behavior need further study to validate.",

Health literacy is a direct influencing factor of health behavior. The most important factor of health status is age. Health behavior and health status have a positive interaction effect.",

We should also try to highlight the importance of future research to extend the scope of health literacy beyond the individual. The research indicates that medical knowledge and health literacy are the main determinants of health behavior and health status, so health educators and health care providers should focus on developing culturally sensitive educational materials using a variety of media. Increased staffing of health educators in clinical settings and community interventions would also help increase health literacy. We would like to develop an intervention that demonstrates how health literacy can be addressed to target community outcomes as opposed to individual outcomes. It is also important for this model to be testedand likely revisedso that intervention strategies to mitigate the impact of low health literacy are informed and conceptually driven.",
