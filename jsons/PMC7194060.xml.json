Clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 have been published in previous studies [3,4], yet, scarce information is available regarding patients with end-stage renal disease and kidney transplantation. Small series and case reports suggest that clinical presentation is mostly mild and unlikely to progress to severe disease possibly as a consequence of impaired T-cell immune response and less capability of developing a cytokine storm [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. In this report, we describe our experience with 51 patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis (n = 25) and renal transplantation (n = 26) that developed COVID-19 and required hospital admission.",

Sixty-nine percent of KT patients had acute kidney injury on admission. According to AKIN classification, 14/18 (78%) were AKIN 1 and 4/18 (22%) AKIN 2.

On the other hand, COVID-19 distinctive biochemical alterations described in early reports from China [4] were comparable to our findings.

In our experience, this was not the case. Our institution has 208 active hemodialysis patients and 39 peritoneal dialysis patients, of whom 25 (10.1%) required hospital admission and 7 (28%) died from direct complications of COVID-19. This mortality was similar to that of a recently published Italian series [10]. We speculate that older age and a high comorbidity burden, well-known risk factors for worse outcomes in COVID-19, might explain the higher mortality observed in our patients. Although steroid therapy was associated with risk of death, this may be due to a selection bias as patients with more severe disease were more likely to receive them. Of note, we have frequently observed poor hemodynamic tolerance during intermittent hemodialysis sessions.",

It is unknown if chronic immunosuppression therapy modifies the presentation and course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our local protocol included partial reduction of immunosuppression based on interruption of antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil/azathioprine) and/or mTORi, reducing tacrolimus dose (25-50%, trough levels 5-6ng/mL) and continue low-dose prednisone (2.5-5mg/day).

None of the patients was admitted to ICU, therefore; we tempt to speculate that the inability to attain advanced intensive care support could have influence the outcome of some patients who eventually died. However, a recent small series reported variable outcomes in KT patients with COVID-19 that required mechanical ventilation [11]. It is important to point out that results of our multivariate analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Of note, treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prophylactic anticoagulation were more commonly administered in kidney transplant survivors, suggesting a hypothetical protective role in this group (\nTable 3\n). However, due to the retrospective nature of our work and the size of our study population, no causal relationships can be established.",
