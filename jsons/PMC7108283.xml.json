Recent shifts in trends and availability of technology-based social media services for public health initiatives offer enormous possibilities for health improvement [4].",

These websites support functions such as social networking (e.g., Facebook, MySpace, Google Plus), professional networking (e.g., LinkedIn), media sharing (e.g., YouTube, Flickr), content production such as blogs and microblogs (e.g., Tumblr, Blogger, Twitter), knowledge/information aggregation (e.g., Wikipedia), and virtual reality and gaming environments (e.g., Second Life) [1]. Facebook, which was established in 2004, is the most popular of these; in 2015, 72% of online adults globally were users [6] and in 2017 it was estimated that Facebook has approximately 1.8 billion active users [7]. These websites are often called social media platforms and are used to create, debate, modify and share material [8]. Social media allows for instant access to and dissemination of information both locally and around the world, and users have the opportunity to play an active part in the reporting and dissemination of online material [9]. The high prevalence of use emphasizes the potential for social media activities to impact people\u2019s knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in both high and low resource settings [10].",

The rapid improvement in Internet access within low-income settings has been enhanced through \u2018leap frogging,\u2019 which refers to the adoption of a more advanced technology while skipping the preceding stage of technology [12]. Leap frogging is made possible through the lower cost and greater efficiency of the new technology [13] as seen in Africa where cellular networks are expanding rapidly, having skipped installation of hard-wired infrastructures, thus facilitating wireless access to the Internet [14]. In 2015, one third of people across developing nations reported owning a smartphone [11], a fast-growing trend expected to accelerate in coming years.",

Social media has given healthcare professionals effective tools for communicating with populations for the purpose of health promotion and patient education, and has been credited with enabling more effective and responsive healthcare services [16], [17]. For example, patients in the United Kingdom have reported that using services supported by social media has resulted in improved communication and shared-decision making, more positive interactions, and a shift towards treating the whole patient rather than just the disease [17].",

The general research questions that guided this review were: (1) What is the current state of literature that addresses the use of social media for health purposes in LMICs? (2) For what purposes are social media being used in LMICs? (3) Who is using social media for health purposes in LMICs? and (4) What are the key issues and implications of social media use in LMICs for health purposes?

A majority of the literature was research-based. Publication dates ranged from 2010 to 2017, with the majority of literature published from 2014 to 2017. Infectious disease surveillance, global emergency response, and the use of social media for health communication were the most common contexts of papers that were published during this period of increased activity in 2014\u20132017. Four themes were identified: use for health education and influence; use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and producers and consumers of social media for health. The geographical focus of the literature was centered on Asian and African nations, with little to no emphasis on other low- and middle-income areas of the world. Table 2\nand the Table A1 in Appendix A provide an overview of the articles included in this scoping review. The following sections discuss these findings in greater detail.",

However, there were very few articles published until 2014 (see Table 3\n). The use of social media for health behaviour change campaigns emerged in the literature in 2011 [49], and has been a regular topic since then. The use of mixed methods research, and the incorporation of theory or other conceptual frameworks was first seen in 2013, the year growth on the topic started to build (Amrita and Biswas, 2013; [30], [54]. This highlights a certain level of maturation of the state of literature even at this early point, three years since the beginning of publication on the topic.

These papers reported on positive and negative patterns of social media use in global emergency and crisis situations. Specific lessons that were highlighted in the literature included what was learned about crisis management practices from the Nigerian famine of the 1960\u2032s [25], the effectiveness of the Twitter response of organizations following the 2010 Haitian earthquake [32], and how social media was used during the 2013 Westgate Mall terror attack in Kenya [50]. Natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response was separated from infectious disease and outbreak situations described above in order to highlight more specifically the different conditions and environments in which social media use has been shown to be influential. Although literature on natural disasters, terrorism and emergency response occurred less frequently than those of infectious disease and outbreaks, it is important to recognize the distinction between the two while highlighting the similarities in process and platform use (i.e., Twitter remains the most common platform method used in the literature of both threads).",

All seven articles highlighted consumers\u2019 expectations of accuracy in social media messaging as well as feasibility issues related to the implementation and sustainability of social media use for health-related purposes (i.e., the maintenance of health-related information requires consistent resource allocation).",

Publication dates ranged from 2010 to 2017 with most of the articles being published from 2014 to 2017. The increased volume of literature during these four years was concurrent with the Ebola crisis and other infectious disease outbreaks around the world. The literature has centered on Asian and African nations, with few articles addressing other geographic areas. Research articles are increasingly present in the literature but, to date, have been limited to non-experimental and descriptive studies. Governmental and non-governmental organizations have been the key producers of social media for health in LMICs, while end-users are typically young or marginalized populations. With its recent use in outbreak, crisis, and disaster management and control, Twitter has been the most popular platform reported in the literature.",

There are also population groups that have been neglected, such maternal-child populations. Although there has been considerable research focused on mHealth and maternal-child health [60], our scoping review did not identify maternal-child health as a focal topic or potential user group for social media use in LMICs. Social media may be a useful adjunct to the use of mHealth applications concerning maternal-child health, and its use for these populations should be studied. Utilizing social media for maternal-child health education and behaviour change campaigns could be a viable way for research in this specific context to begin.",

Despite the limited volume of the literature, there is evidence that the use of social media in LMICs has the potential for far-reaching influence on health, especially for public health issues. Social media has the ability to facilitate disease surveillance, mass communication, health education, knowledge translation, and collaboration among health providers. However, concerns about the information quality and the potential for misinformation may act as a barrier to its use. Moreover, misinformation or poorly communicated information can contribute to negative health behaviours and adverse health outcomes amongst consumers [61], as well as hysteria and chaos. In addition to attending to accuracy, organizations using social media should give attention to the readability of an organization\u2019s social media pages and platforms to build credibility and enhance user friendliness. Promotion of credible social media sites by governments, health care professionals and researchers, as well as education on the appropriate use of social media, could help to lessen the effect of misinformation. Finally, there may be lessons to be learned from the leap-frog effect that has been observed in relation to the use of social media for health purposes in LMICs, with the potential for rapid advances to be made in other areas of health care or other sectors, such as education.",

Although this is common in scoping reviews [62], we may have missed relevant papers published in the languages of the LMICs. Second, although an effort was made to minimize publication bias by searching systematically for grey literature through Google and Google Scholar search engines, publication bias cannot be entirely excluded. For example, each search in the Google database yielded several hundred thousand results, but for time and resource reasons, the search was limited to the first ten pages of each search result. This may have led to some relevant results being unintentionally excluded. However, as both Google and Google Scholar search results are generally sorted by relevance, with the most applicable information listed first [63], this may have limited the degree of publication bias.
