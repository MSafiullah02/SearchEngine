Early communication will prevent CPR attempts in patients who will not benefit from CPR, and improve outcomes, and reduce the risk to staff.",

All ICU patients and half of ward patients had ECG monitoring at the time of cardiac arrest. Earlier identification of worsening lung injury including with CT scanning and escalation of oxygen therapy including high-flow nasal oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and early tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation prior to deterioration and cardiac arrest may have prevented some cardiac arrests. In addition assessment of myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 by monitoring myocardial enzymes, brain natriuretic peptides, and ultrasound, and ECG for arrhythmia may have prevented some cardiac arrests. We observed that cardiac arrest In our opinion, medical personnel should wear high-level personal protection equipment (PPE), including N95 masks, gowns, gloves, goggles, visors, and a powered air-purifying respirator at the beginning of each work shift and during CPR. In our experience, the PPE can loosen and the mask can slip during chest compression. Clothing should therefore be loose fitting to prevent tearing during CPR, and rescuers should switch if their mask is slipping. In addition chest compressions in PPE cause more rapid fatigue. The person doing compressions should change more often (e.g. every minute) to limit fatigue, damage to PPE, and slipping of the face mask. The use of a positive pressure respirator hood could be helpful. In addition, a mechanical chest compression device can be used to free rescuers",
