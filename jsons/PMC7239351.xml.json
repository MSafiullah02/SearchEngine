Zhang C et al. reported a detailed discussion about liver injury in COVID-19 [1]. In fact, 14\u201353% of COVID-19 patients present abnormal levels of aminotransferases. The degree of liver damage depends on the severity of COVID-19. It seems that cytokine storm syndrome, ischemic hypoxia related to pneumonia and pharmacologic liver injury are the main causes of elevated liver enzymes. However, it has been demonstrated that SARS-COV-2 binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to infect the cells. In addition to lung tissue, the ACE2 receptor has also been found in cholangiocytes while the hepatocytes expressed it weakly [1]. Interestingly, it has been shown that ACE2 expression is significantly increased with chronic liver injury and cirrhosis, not only in cholangiocytes but also in hepatocytes [2]. It has been demonstrated in a mouse model after hemi-hepatectomy that ACE2 expression is upregulated during hepatocyte proliferation. Thus, nascent hepatocytes expressing ACE2 receptor could be susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection [3].",

In a similar way, once the cascade of inflammatory reactions is triggered by SARS-COV-2 or in case of related bacterial infection, COVID-19 could be responsible for the development of PHLF. In addition, it has been found that lung injury (a common complication of COVID-19) is an independent risk factor for major morbidity and mortality after hepatectomy [5].",
