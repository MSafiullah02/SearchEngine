This means that 168 endocrinologists (out of 502) have dedicated most of their working hours to COVID-19 related activities (141 in North, 31 in Middle and 9 in South Italy). Similarly occurred for nurses usually working in Endocrinology or Diabetology. Overall 192 nurses have dedicated most of their time to COVID-19 healthcare. The reorganization resulted in a reduction or suspension of the Endocrine Day-Hospital admissions for 89.6% of sites, but outpatient activities, limited to urgent and non-deferrable outpatients, was almost universally guaranteed.",

Translated into numbers, it corresponds to a \"small army\" of at least 190 young in-training endocrinologists who are helping COVID-19 wards. The involvement, was much higher in the North (in 68.4% more than half of the trainees were used), smaller in the Middle (12.6%), not requested in the South of Italy. The latter finding must be interpreted in light of the different geographical impact that the pandemic.
