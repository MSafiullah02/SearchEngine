This disease caused by this virus was first reported in 1931 and was soon distributed worldwide (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Infectious bronchitis virus is a highly infectious and contagious agent in chickens. The respiratory tract is the primary target of virus infection, whereas the urogenital system, including the kidneys and the oviducts, is also affected. Young chickens infected with IBV can acquire permanent damage to their oviducts. Older infected chickens may exhibit poor feed efficiency (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Cavanagh, 2007). Infectious bronchitis virus has great economic importance owing to its effects on egg-laying performance and meat production (Cook, 2002).",

The spike glycoprotein (S), which forms the surface projections of the virion, is thought to be a determinant of the host range and pathogenicity (Cavanagh, 2007). The posttranslationally cleaved subunits of S, S1, and S2 carry the epitopes for inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies (Koch et al., 1990). The S1 subunit is involved in virus entry and hemagglutination activity (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986; Koch and Kant, 1990). The envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins are required for virion assembly. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is closely associated with the RNA genome packaging (Lai and Holmes, 2001).",

Moreover, IBV possesses a unique discontinuous transcription system and a polymerase jumping phenomenon, which contribute to the high frequency of RNA recombination (Lai and Holmes, 2001). Over the last decade, the continuing emergence of variant strains has complicated disease control. A circulating serotype may experience antigenic shift via slight variations in the S1 gene (Cavanagh et al., 1992). Poor cross-protection is conferred among the dozens of serotypes (Cavanagh, 2007).",

Massachusetts (Mass)-type strains such as M41 and H120 have been widely used for immunization (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). However, exposure of animals to live vaccines can facilitate the spread of the viruses in large poultry populations (Farsang et al., 2002). By acting as a heterologous RNA donor template, vaccine viruses may contribute to the genetic evolution of IBV (Wang et al., 1993); that is, genomic recombination with vaccine strains can occur (Jia et al., 1995; Bochkov et al., 2007; Mondal and Cardona, 2007).",

New IBV geno- and serotypes are continually reported (Liu and Kong, 2004; Dolz et al., 2006). However, information on IBV prevalence is not frequently addressed in these reports. In Taiwan, in addition to 2 local progeny strain types, Taiwan group I (TW-I) and Taiwan group II (TW-II), the heterologous Mass serotype has been used as a vaccine for over a decade. A recent molecular investigation using the 6.8-kb structural gene region of IBV revealed that Taiwan IBV undergo recombination (Chen et al., 2009). In such a vulnerable epizootiological situation, viruses may evolve rapidly under selection pressure. Therefore, monitoring disease status and analyzing the circulating viruses is critical.",

A ratio lower than 1 indicates that a specific gene region may be under positive pressures (Korber, 2000). In addition, the presence of positive selection (dN > dS) and purifying selection (dN < dS) was tested using a 1-tailed z-test with MEGA version 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007).

According to Roussan et al. (2008), IBV was detected in up to 60% of the examined broiler flocks in Jordan, and 59% of submitted clinical samples were positive for IBV in Western Europe (Worthington et al., 2008). The RT-PCR assays employed in most surveillance studies, which amplify sequences directly from tissues or samples, are sensitive. However, this assay may not be able to discriminate between disease and vaccine strains. A higher IBV detection rate may be found in investigations with samples or flocks that were analyzed because of suspected IBV infection. In this study, the tracheas of slaughtered chickens were collected in poultry slaughterhouses, where sampled chickens were inspected and found to be apparently normal. Biased sampling was therefore avoided. The data obtained from our study may cover subclinical infection circumstances and may represent a more factual disease status.

A decade ago, local IBV were molecularly characterized and found to belong to 2 populations (TW-I and TW-II) based on the RFLP of the S1 gene (Wang and Tsai, 1996). However, local IBV are continually evolving. Infectious bronchitis virus 3374/05 was previously characterized as a natural recombinant between the Taiwan- and China CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains, and frequent recombination events have been observed in several progeny strains (Chen et al., 2009). The 13 reported IBV in this work were molecularly characterized. Among them, most isolates (11/13, 84.6%) were closely related to TW-I strains, suggesting that TW-I is a dominant genogroup in Taiwan. However, phylogenetic analyses revealed that isolate 3382/06 clustered with the TW-I group based on the S1 gene but not based on the N gene. To identify the recombination site, a fragment covering the 3\u2032 end of the structural protein gene region, about 6.8 kb in length, was further investigated. We determined the viral sequences using at least 4 identical results from separate RT-PCR products. The results obtained from the interpretation programs were supported by statistical evidence. Surprisingly, in addition to the first crossover with the CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains in the S gene, there was an abrupt shift in nucleotide identities among the M, 5a, 5b, and N genes, strongly indicating another recombination event. This second recombination event was between isolate 3382/06 and strain H120. Two putative H120-like recombinants have also been reported in Italy (Bochkov et al., 2007), from which different phylogeny profiles between the S1 and N gene regions with respect to H120 were described. In this study, we schematically present the crossover events in the plot, and the genome positions of the putative recombination sites are readily observed.",

For a decade, due to the lack of proper homologous protection against local viruses, disease prevention in Taiwan relied on a cross-protective effect conferred by heterologous Mass-type strains such as M41 and H120. In particular, live attenuated viruses are widely used to vaccinate many chicken types. Viruses were likely shed and now circulate in the field. Furthermore, isolate 3381/06 was closely related to the American group strains, another heterologous vaccine type approved in Taiwan. More challenging problems may arise if multiple genome incorporation events occur among viruses. Thus, the crucial observation from this study alerts the need for reconsideration of the policy of IBV control. Indeed, 2 local IBV vaccines have been developed for this purpose (Huang and Wang, 2006).",

To address the relationship between the selection pressures and the long-term genetic variations in Taiwan IBV, nearly all available S1 gene sequences from local viruses were collected and analyzed. Compared with the average dS/dN ratio of 1.6 previously obtained in the molecular characterization of Italy 02 genotypes in Spain (Dolz et al., 2006), our data, which showed average dS/dN ratios of 4.27 (TW-I) and 3.34 (TW-II), were not suggestive of a high rate of nonsynonymous changes in Taiwan IBV. No positive selection pressures might drive the evolution of the 2 Taiwan IBV genogroups. Alternatively, there was evidence of purifying selection.

The 2 recombinant variants 3374/05 and 3382/06 were selected for further analysis of their antigenic serotypes. The results showed that no cross-neutralization effect was achieved between isolate 3374/05 and 2 groups of local viruses as well as the Mass type, suggesting that isolate 3374/05 is a new serotype in Taiwan. Isolate 3382/06 possessed the same serotype as its S1 gene-homologous TW-I strains. Therefore, chickens infected with those variants were probably not protected by the current IBV prevention program. However, the disease history of the infected flocks from which variants 3374/05 and 3382/06 originated was unavailable. The pathogenicity of those variants awaits further study.",
