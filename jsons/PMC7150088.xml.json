It has been estimated that at least 12 guests and visitors to this hotel became infected through contact with this medical doctor directly or indirectly. The disease then spread from Hong Kong rapidly to Hanoi, Singapore, and Toronto when infected visitors and guests returned to their home countries. One of the infected visitors, the index case of Hong Kong's first outbreak, was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital in early March with pneumonia, and he subsequently infected 138 hospital staff, patients, and visitors.1 The use of nebulized medications in the index case is believed to have caused this very extensive hospital outbreak, since nebulization could have generated a large amount of infective droplets. The first few pediatric cases were household contacts of the initial cohort of adult patients from the hospital outbreak. At that time, SARS had not yet been recognized as a highly infectious disease. The disease involving health care workers spread rapidly to the community by visitors to the hospital wards.",

Other symptoms include coryza and cough. Chills, rigor, myalgia, and malaise, which are common in adult patients, may also be present in older children and adolescents, but are rare in young children. Some patients, adults and children alike, may present with diarrhea. Young children appear to have milder disease with shorter time period to resolution, while the course of disease in older children is more similar to that of the adults. It is unclear why children, especially those under the age of 12 years, would be less severely affected, but it might be because they have been exposed to many other respiratory viruses, which could make their immune systems more resilient. Others have proposed that young children are not able to mount a \u201cheightened\u201d mature immune response as seen in adult patients during the immune dysregulation phase of SARS and thus suffer less organ damage with its associated morbidity and mortality. Besides, children in general present with fewer comorbidities than adults. Physical examination is normal in most if not all young children, whereas inspiratory crackles over the lung bases are present in some adolescent and adult patients.",

There may also be thrombocytopenia, a moderately deranged clotting profile, as well as elevated concentrations of liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine kinase. These laboratory parameters, together with the presenting clinical features, may help in the clinical diagnosis of the disease. We have also studied the inflammatory cytokine profile in SARS patients. They have markedly raised concentrations of circulating interleukin-1\u03b2, which may suggest the selective activation of the caspase-1-dependent pathway. Other key proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) were only mildly elevated; this is in sharp contrast to H5N1 influenza infection, in which these cytokines are significantly elevated.16\n",

Sometimes even the contact history might be misleading. In our hospital, we came across two children whose initial symptoms were suggestive of SARS and who had a definite history of contact with an affected individual, but who were later diagnosed to have bacterial septicemia.20 The World Health Organization has subsequently revised the definition of a probable case to include a suspected case of SARS that is positive for SARS-CoV.",

SARS predominantly presents radiologically with ground-glass opacification and pathologically as revealed from autopsy results of fatal adult cases, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, and scanty interstitial inflammatory-cell infiltrates.22 Treatment during the outbreak therefore include agents against SARS-CoV as well as anti-inflammatory therapy to prevent viral replication-induced pneumonitis and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis.23 Our initial practice is to treat children with suspect SARS with antibiotics covering organisms associated with both common bacterial and atypical pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma). We would add oral ribavirin 40 to 60 mg/kg/day in three 8-hourly doses if a definite contact history makes SARS very likely. If the symptoms, especially fever and general well-being, do not respond to the treatment within 48 hours, corticosteroid will be commenced in the form of oral prednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses or IV hydrocortisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours. If fever persists or when there is clinical deterioration or progressive chest radiograph change, pulse methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg/dose will be given every 24 hours for up to three doses, depending on clinical response. Oral ribavirin will at the same time be changed to 20 to 60 mg/kg/day intravenously given every 8 hours. Steroid will be continued for a total of 2 weeks in the form of prednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or hydrocortisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours after methylprednisolone. If the child's condition improves, the steroid will then be reduced to half the dose and gradually tapered off over a week. However, if the chest radiograph is still abnormal by day 21, low-dose steroid will be continued for a longer time and slowly tapered off according to clinical and radiologic assessment. In the younger children in whom the infection appears to run a milder course, an obvious question is whether treatment with either medication, either alone or in combination, is of any benefit. This question can only be answered by properly conducted randomized controlled trial.",

The combination when used with concomitant ribavirin yielded significantly better clinical outcome in adult patients.26 There are also strong advocates for not using corticosteroids at all, for fear of secondary sepsis and other complications (such as avascular necrosis). Not only is the efficacy of steroid therapy unproven in SARS, its timing and dosage regimens are also controversial.

Nosocomial transmission of the disease can effectively be stopped by enforcement of routine standard, contact, and droplet precautions in all clinical areas, and additional airborne precautions in all high-risk areas. During the SARS period, we adopted the policy of having a dedicated team of doctors and nurses providing care to all patients admitted to the designated SARS areas. We also have separate wards for patient triage, confirmed SARS cases, and step-down of patients in whom SARS has been ruled out. Designated changing rooms and areas for gowning and ungowning are also identified. We have summarized our experience in isolation procedures and the use of personal protection equipment in a recently published article.29 An important lesson that we learned from this SARS epidemic relates to the need to enhance infection control programs in hospitals. A reliable alert mechanism, good communication among hospital staff members, efficient surveillance infrastructure, and continuing education to promote importance of appropriate patient care practices (especially hand washing) are vital ingredients for a successful infection control program. There are still many unanswered questions about the virus; its other possible modes of transmission, its infectivity during the incubation period and after clinical recovery, and whether it will become an endemic disease will have to be established.",
