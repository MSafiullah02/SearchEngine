            "text": "Background: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) cause high neonatal mortality and are related to inadequate aseptic technique during the care and maintenance of a catheter. The incidence of CR-BSI among neonates in Hung Vuong Hospital was higher than that of other neonatal care centres in Vietnam. Methods: An 18-month pre-and post-intervention study was conducted over three 6-month periods to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention for CR-BSI and to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. During the intervention period, we trained all nurses in the Department of Neonatology on BSI preventive practices, provided auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during catheter care and maintenance, and reorganised preparation of total parenteral nutrition. All neonates with intravenous catheter insertion \u226548 h in the pre-and postintervention period were enrolled. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect data. Blood samples were collected for cultures. We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR-BSI incidence rates and logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. Results: Of 2225 neonates enrolled, 1027 were enrolled in the pre-intervention period, of which 53 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8399 catheter-days, and 1198 were enrolled in the post-intervention period, of which 32 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8324 catheter-days. Incidence rates of CR-BSI significantly decreased after the intervention (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.94). Days of hospitalisation, episodes of non-catheter-related hospital-acquired infections, and the proportion of deaths significantly decreased after the intervention (p < 0.01). The CR-BSI was associated with days of intravenous catheter (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), use of endotracheal intubation (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.27-4.06), and intravenous injection (OR = 8.50, 95% CI 1.14-63.4). Conclusions: The interventions significantly decreased the incidence rate of CR-BSI. Regular refresher training and auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during care and maintenance of catheters are critical to reducing CR-BSI.",

            "text": "Intravenous catheter insertion is vital to managing critically ill patients, but it may involve a high risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI). Bloodstream infection, usually caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO), may be fatal and result in a long hospital stay and high treatment costs [1] . The most common pathogens of CR-BSI are coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp. [2, 3] . The incidence rates of CR-BSI range from 3.8-11.3 per 1000 neonate-days in neonatal intensive care units in developed countries, accounting for 30% of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in paediatric hospitals [1, 4, 5] . The rates are usually much higher in developing countries due to hospital overload, insufficient medical equipment, and unsafe aseptic practices by healthcare workers [6] . Guembe et al. showed that the CR-BSI rate in developing countries was 18.7%, while that of the United States was 0.1% [7] . Studies have shown several basic infection control practices such as hand hygiene, skin disinfection, dressing catheter sites, and appropriate intravascular catheters are effective in reducing CR-BSI [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The aims of this study were to (i) assess the incidence and causative organisms of CR-BSI, (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, and (iii) identify the risk factors associated with CR-BSI. In all, 71 nurses were trained in three one-day handson training courses. During the course, intravenous catheter insertion technique was first reviewed. This was followed by a demonstration and practice of handwashing, aseptic technique, maximal sterile barrier protection (e.g. head caps, facemasks, sterile body gowns, and sterile gloves), antiseptic use, skin preparation, and catheter care and maintenance. Training materials for the BSI preventive practices were adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections [1] . All nurses of DON were requested to take a pre-and post-test, and they had to obtain at least 80% of the maximum score on the post-test. The auditing and feedback were recorded and reported in daily meetings in DON to maximise the nurses' learning, knowledge, and skills.",

The postintervention incidence rate was much lower than that of a study conducted at the HVH in 2007 (15.3 per 1000 catheter-days) and of a study conducted at Children's Hospital No. 1, Vietnam in 2005 (7.5 per 1000 catheterdays) [12, 13] . Compared with neonatal care units in other countries, the post-intervention incidence rate in SD standard deviation this study was also lower than the rates of studies conducted in the Philippines during 2005-2009 and in Turkey in 2008 [4, 17] . However, the rate after the intervention in our study was still higher than that of studies conducted in the developed countries, e.g. in the United States and Spain [18] [19] [20] [21] . Although there were differences of the characteristics of neonates and catheter insertions in these studies (e.g. most neonates in our study were inserted by peripheral intravenous catheters and in a few cases with umbilical catheters), the rates of our study indicated that the intervention was effective, especially in resource-poor settings in Vietnam. The effective intervention must have resulted from significant improvements in the nurses' knowledge and compliance with the CR-BSI preventive practices after the training. In a hand-hygiene-focused intervention in Brazil (2009), the rate of CR-BSI significantly decreased from 24.1 to 14.9 per 1000 catheter-days [22] . Several studies have shown that intensified training and educational programmes on hand hygiene and aseptic technique decreased the risk of CR-BSIs [20, 21, [23] [24] [25] . Our study not only implemented education interventions, but also included other interventions, such as auditing and feedback of compliance with aseptic technique and reorganisation of TPN preparation by preparing it under a laminar airflow hood in a clean room in DOP as recommended by WHO. The intervention probably led to a significant decrease of episodes of HAI among CR-BSI cases as well as hospital stays, number of deaths, and episodes of HAI among neonates with intravenous catheter insertions in the post-intervention period.",

The decrease of coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter spp. detected in blood samples in the post-intervention period highlights the effectiveness of BSI preventive practices, including auditing of and feedback about aseptic technique during care and maintenance of catheters [28] . Because of limited resources, we could not evaluate the effectiveness of each individual intervention. However, the types of interventions in our study may be appropriate for similar studies conducted in neonatal intensive care units in resource-poor settings.",

            "text": "Escherichia vulneris is usually found in wounds. It is an opportunistic pathogen and can cause sepsis followed by complicated diarrhoea [29] . Escherichia vulneris has rarely been reported as a CR-BSI pathogen. To our knowledge, only one CR-BSI case caused by Escherichia vulneris has been reported in the literature: the casepatient had poor nutritional status and received TPN via [30] . In our study, we detected two cases, both premature neonates who received TPN via a catheter, that were positive for Escherichia vulneris. Hence, the pathogen should be suspected in premature neonates receiving TPN via a catheter. Enterobacter spp. was a common CR-BSI pathogen found on nurses' hands and MRDO [10, 31, 32] ; however, the percentage of MDR Enterobacter spp. among reported CR-BSI pathogens was relatively high (13%) compared with previous studies, and no CR-BSI MDR Enterobacter spp. was found in intensive care units in developing countries [31] [32] [33] . TPN is a controversial risk factor in the literature [34] . TPN was a critical risk factor of CR-BSI [9, 11] , but it was not found to be a risk factor in our study, which is consistent with other studies [35, 36] . This could be due to our intervention of relocating TPN preparation from DON to a clean room in DOP and preparing parenteral nutrition under a laminar airflow hood. Birth weight and preterm neonates have not been identified as risk factors in this study or in other studies [9, 35] . Instead, we identified risk factors that included the days of intravenous catheters, intravenous injection, and the use of endotracheal intubation that were consistent with other studies [19, 25, [35] [36] [37] . Although the interventions in the study were shown to be effective, three risk factors are related directly to catheter usage. It is clear that catheter care and other BSI preventive practices should be regularly monitored and good practices should be maintained. The duration and types of catheters used for neonates need to be further studied.",
