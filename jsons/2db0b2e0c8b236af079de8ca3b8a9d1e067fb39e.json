Rather than use a single algorithm or apply multiple algorithms simultaneously, our approach is based on ensembles of algorithms. The ensembles lead to better performance in terms of higher true alert rates for a given false alert rate. Combinations can be employed at the data preprocessing step and/or at the monitoring step. We discuss the advantages of such an approach and illustrate its usefulness using authentic modern biosurveillance data.",

            "text": "Humanitarian Logistics at Georgia Tech have shown that pandemic outbreak effects can be greatly reduced if quarantine is imposed at the early stages of the disease. 1 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) lay out guidelines and strategies for reducing disease transmission, including use of personal protective equipment (e.g., masks and gloves), hand hygiene, and safe work practices. The CDC also recommends actions to be taken during the earliest stage of a pandemic, when the first potential cases or disease clusters are detected. These include individual-level containment measures such as patient isolation and identification, monitoring, and quarantine of contacts. 2 The early detection of disease outbreaks therefore plays a major role in preventing disease transmission and reducing the size of the affected population. In modern biosurveillance a wide range of pre-diagnostic and diagnostic daily counts are monitored for the purpose of alerting public health officials when there is early evidence of a disease outbreak. This is in contrast to traditional biosurveillance, where only diagnostic measures (such as mortality and lab reports) are examined, usually locally, and at aggregation levels such as weekly, monthly, or annually. Moreover, in modern biosurveillance the goal is prospective while traditional biosurveillance is more retrospective in nature. Although the tasks and data types and structures differ widely between traditional and modern biosurveillance, most monitoring algorithms have been migrated from traditional to modern systems. The result is that current modern biosurveillance detection methods suffer from multiple statistical and practical limitations that greatly deteriorate their ability to achieve their intended purpose. For a general overview of the statistical challenges that arise in biosurveillance see Shmueli and Burkom (2008) . In particular, there is often a mismatch between the types of 1 http://www.tli.gatech.edu/research/humanitarian/projects.php 2 http://www.hhs.gov/pandemicflu/plan/appendixf.html. mission of diseases can be diminished. Researchers at the Center for A major goal of public health is to figure out whether and how trans-algorithms being used and the data structure of modern biosurveillance data. This means that the assumptions behind those algorithms with regards to baseline behavior and outbreak nature are often violated in the modern biosurveillance context. Another important problem is that of multiplicity: when monitoring multiple data sources with multiple streams, using multiple monitoring algorithms, the unavoidable result is a large inflation in false alarm rate. In the case of biosurveillance the implication of excess false alerts outweighs the benefit of an early detection, as the practical result is that public health users ignore alerts altogether. An excess of false alerts usually leads to the ignoring of true alerts, and potentially to deletion of the alerting system altogether. An example is the rocket-alert system in the city of Ashkelon, Israel that was recently disconnected because of five false alarms in April 2008 which led to panic. Thus, when a rocket fell on a shopping mall in Ashkelon the following month, there was no early warning. 3 In this chapter we focus on a solution to two important problems: that of multiplicity in monitoring algorithms and the unknown nature of the outbreak signature. We show that by combining results from multiple algorithms in a way that controls the overall false alert rate, we can actually improve overall performance. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 describes control charts in general and the limitations of applying them directly to raw modern biosurveillance data. It then describes a preprocessing step that is needed before applying control charts. In Sect. 3 we describe an authentic modern biosurveillance dataset and the simulation of outbreak signatures. Section 4 introduces the notion of model combinations in terms of combining residuals and combining control chart output. Section 5 applies the different combination methods to our data, and we display results showing the improvement in detection performance due to method combination. Section 6 summarizes the main points and results and describes potential enhancements.",

In the context of modern biosurveillance, control charts are used to monitor aggregated daily counts of individual healthcare seeking behavior (such as daily arrivals to emergency departments or medication sales), for the purpose of early detection of shifts from expected baseline behavior. Three control charts are commonly used to monitor such pre-diagnostic daily data, and are implemented (with some variations) in the three main national biosurveillance systems in the U.S.: BioSense (by CDC), ESSENCE (by DoD), and RODS. The three charts are Shewhart, Cumulative Sum (CuSum) and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) charts. These control charts are described in detail in Sect. 2.1.",

In reality time series of such daily counts often contain seasonal patterns, day-of-week effects, and holiday effects (see Figure 8 -1 for illustration). Monitoring such data therefore requires an initial processing step where such explainable patterns are removed. Such methods are described in Sect. 2.2. For illustration, compare Figures 8-1 and 8-2 that show a series of daily military clinic visits before and after preprocessing. One explainable pattern that is removed is the day-of-week effect, which is clearly visible in Figure The second challenge of applying control charts in the modern biosurveillance context is that each type of chart is most efficient at capturing a specific outbreak signature (Box and Luceno, 1997 ). Yet, in the context of biosurveillance the outbreak signature is unknown, and in fact the goal is to detect a wide range of signatures for a variety of disease outbreaks, contagious and non-contagious, both natural and bioterror-related. It is therefore unclear which method should be used to detect such a wide range of unspecified anomalies.",

We set the size of the affected population to be proportional to the variance of the data series (Lotze et al., 2007) . because biosurveillance systems are designed to detect early, more subtle indications of a disease outbreak. We also consider a lognormal progression signature, because incubation periods have been shown to follow a lognormal distribution with parameters dependent on the disease agent and route of infection. In order to generate a trimmed lognormal signature (Burkom, 2003) , we set the mean of the lognormal distribution to 2.5 and the standard deviation to 1. We trim 30% of the long tail, limiting the outbreak horizon to approximately 20 days. This choice of parameters results in a gradually increasing outbreak with a slow fading rate (long tail). Figure 8 -5 illustrates the process of injecting a lognormal outbreak into the raw data.",

The results clearly show the advantage of the combined method in terms of both increasing true alert rate, subject to a given false alert rate, and in reducing the variance of the true alert rate. The main drawback of the first experiment is that the computation is very time consuming. Since achieving the optimal weights for the control charts is an NP complete problem, computation time increases exponentially in the length of the training data. Moreover, examining the actual weights shows that EWMA and Shewhart charts dominate the combination such that alerts are mostly determined by one of them (e.g., Shewhart) combined with an alert by one other method (e.g., either EWMA or CuSum). In an effort to reduce computation time, yet seek for good combinations, we take a hybrid approach: we choose among a small set of pre-determined combinations that appear to work well. This approach greatly reduces computation time and allows for real-time computation in actual settings.",

We see that using Shewhart+ increases the true alert rate by approximately 50% compared to Shewhart. Also, the day-of-week residual combination outperforms the alternative preprocessing methods. The best performance is obtained by using both the day-of-week residual combination and applying the Shewhart+ to monitor the series. Thus, method combination provides improved detection at each of the preprocessing and monitoring levels, as well as when they are combined.
