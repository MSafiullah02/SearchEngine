Venezuelan equine encephalitis is an emerging infectious disease in Latin America [3,4]. There are several strains of VEEV closely related that have been classified into two epidemiological groups: Enzootic and epizootic strains [3,5]. Enzootic strains (Subtypes I, DF varieties, and Subtypes II-VI) are regularly isolated in lowland and tropical forests in Florida, Mexico, Central, and South America, where the Culex vector mosquito (Melanoconiun) spp.[3,6,7].",

The outbreaks have been registered for decades in countries with enzootic circulation. The implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with previously unknown VEEV activity. The enzootic subtypes of VEEV are frequently detected and isolated in habitats where they circulate in rodent reservoirs and mosquitoes. The main reservoirs are rodents of wild species of Oryzomys, Zigodontomys, Heteromys, Peromyscus, and Proechimys. These animals become infected and develop viremia that is sufficient to infect the vectors [9,10]. Different studies have reported evidence of VEEV infection, suggesting that bats (frugivorous, sanguinivorous, and insectivorous) could be host to arboviruses of public health impact in America [11-15]. Clinically, VEEV is indistinguishable from dengue and other arboviral diseases, often humans infected with VEEV symptoms appear within 2-5 days, and range from febrile, or flu-like symptoms, such as malaise, fever, chills, and myalgia, to coma and death are registered in ~1% of cases [3]. The confirmatory diagnosis requires specialized laboratory tests that are difficult to afford in regions with limited economic incomes.",

The final diagnosis was a severe non-suppurative meningoencephalitis of viral type and severe non-suppurative hepatitis of infectious viral type. Concerning the other specimen Artibeus planirostris, in the lung, there was a hyperplasia of a lymphoid type associated with bronchi, thickening of alveolar septa, mononuclear lymphocytic alveolitis, and mixed infiltrate with mononuclear predominance. In the liver, mild non-suppurative hepatitis of the lymphocytic type was observed.",

Consequently, to better understand the activity pattern and the transmission networks of arboviruses, it is essential to understand the assembly of host species and vectors, their interactions, and fluctuations through time and space. Although the natural infection rate found in this study by molecular methods is low (0.2%), it poses the challenge of being able to complement surveillance with serological detection to establish the presence of the virus in regions where the disease is absent in humans.
