Recently, it has been shown that classical information retrieval (IR) weighting models -such as BM25can be adapted to effectively recommend new social contacts to a given user. However, the exact properties that make such adapted contact recommendation models effective at the task are as yet unknown. In this paper, inspired by new advances in the axiomatic theory of IR, we study the existing IR axioms for the contact recommendation task. Our theoretical analysis and empirical findings show that while the classical axioms related to term frequencies and term discrimination seem to have a positive impact on the recommendation effectiveness, those related to length normalization tend to be not desirable for the task.",

This specific class of recommender systems has the interesting property that users play a dual role: they are the users to whom we want to provide recommendations, but they are also the items we want to recommend [32] .

In particular, we empirically analyze whether satisfying the IR axioms leads to an increase in the performances of the algorithms. Interestingly, we find that while this is generally true, the axioms related to length normalization negatively impact the contact recommendation performance, since they interfere with a key evolutionary principle in social networks, namely preferential attachment [8] .",

They also analyzed the effect such properties had on the effectiveness of state-of-the-art models such as BM25 [29] or query likelihood [27] , and found that, with minor modifications to adhere to the different proposed axioms, the modified IR models achieved an improved retrieval performance.",

Therefore, the adapted methods satisfy the same constraints in the social network as those satisfied in the text IR space, and, if they are only satisfied under certain conditions, we can find the new conditions just by adapting them for the contact recommendation task. Then, models like PL2 [3, 7] , the pivoted normalization vector space model (VSM) [36] query likelihood with Dirichlet (QLD) [42] or Jelinek-Mercer smoothing (QLJM) [27] keep their original properties in this new space.",

As the only difference between the original and the version of BM25 defined by Sanz-Cruzado and Castells is just the definition of the candidate length, it is straightforward to prove that all edge weight constraints and NDC are satisfied in the same way as they are for textual IR: NDC is unconditionally true, whereas all EWC axioms depend just on the condition:",

Hence, we introduce a new IR-based approach, namely the Extreme BM25 (EBM25) method, a variant of BM25 where we make the k parameter tend to infinity. In comparison with BM25, all constraints are satisfied under the conditions specified for BM25, except EWC2 and EWC3, which are not satisfied at all for EBM25. In the BM25 model, under the conditions of EWC2, the k parameter establishes how f u (v) grows as a function of the weight of the only common neighbor between the target and candidate users. The greater the value of k, the more the growth function approximates a linear function. When k \u2192 \u221e, the growth becomes linear, and as a consequence, the model does not meet the EWC2 constraint. A similar issue occurs with EWC3.",

Since weights are binary in the Twitter follow graphs and Facebook, we focus here on interaction graphs, where the interaction frequency provides a natural basis for edge weighting. A first natural question that arises when we study these axioms is whether the weights are useful or not for providing good recommendations. This is equivalent to test the importance of the first axiom for the contact recommendation task. To answer that question, we compare the two options (binarized vs. not binarized weights) in all algorithms which make use of weights: cosine similarity between users and all the IR models except BIR. We show the results in Fig. 1(a) , where each dot represents a different approach. In the x axis, we show the nDCG@10 value for the unweighted approaches, whereas the y axis shows nDCG@10 for the weighted ones. We can see that using weights results in an inferior performance in all algorithms except for BM25 and the simple cosine similarity. These observations suggest that EWC1 does not appear to be a reliable heuristic for contact recommendation in networks.",

Fixing the k parameter for the BM25 model (using the optimal configuration from our experiments), we compare different parameter configurations for BM25 and EBM25. Results are shown in Fig. 1(b) , where every dot in the plot corresponds to a different model configuration, the x axis represents the nDCG@10 values for BM25, and the y axis those of the EBM25 model. As it can be observed, EBM25 does not improve over BM25 for almost every configuration (dots are all below the y = x plane), thus showing that, as long as EWC1 is important for the model, both EWC2 and EWC3 are relevant.",

For that purpose, we address the following question: for any friends-of-friends algorithm, such as Adamic-Adar [1] or the IR models, is it beneficial to reward the number of common users between the target and the candidate users? To analyze this, we compare the MCN approach (which satisfies the constraint) with a binarized version of MCN which returns all people at distance 2 regardless of the common neighbor count. Restricting the test set to people at distance 2, Table 5 shows the resulting AUC [15] of the MCN algorithm, averaged over users on each network. Under these conditions, the binarized version would have an AUC value of 0.5. Hence, our results show that the number of common neighbors seem to be a strong signal for providing accurate recommendations (and, therefore, EWC3 seems to be important on its own for the contact recommendation task).",

Therefore, to check the effectiveness benefit of this axiom, we compare -in terms of nDCG@10 -the BM25, EBM25, QLD, QLJM and the pivoted normalization VSM models with variants of them that lack term discrimination. Figure 2 shows the difference between different variants of each model. In the figure, a positive value indicates that the original version (with term discrimination) performs better. We observe that in an overwhelming majority of points the original versions achieve a better accuracy, hence NDC appears to be key to providing good contact recommendations. This confirms the hypothesis in many recommendation approaches that using high-degree users to discriminate which users are recommended does not seem to be a good idea [1, 43] .",

For that purpose, similarly to the previous section, we compare the BM25, EBM25, QLJM, QLD and the pivoted normalization VSM models with versions of the models lacking the normalization by the candidate user length (which do not satisfy CLNC1 and EW-CLNC) using nDCG@10. We show a graph showing the differences in accuracy between different variants of the algorithms in Fig. 3(a) . Since there are few differences between datasets, we only show results for the interactions network of the Twitter 1-month dataset. In the figure, we observe an opposite trend to what was expected: instead of performing worse, the algorithms without normalization do improve the results. Therefore, it seems that the different length normalization constraints are not useful for contact recommendation. These observations are consistent with the preferential attachment phenomenon in social networks [8] , whereby high-degree users are more likely to receive new links than long-tail degree users. As an example, we check this in Fig. 3(b) , where we compare the performances of the recommendation approaches listed in Section 6.1 with the average in-degree, out-degree and (undirected) degree of the recommended people. We observe that, in general, in-degree and degree are clearly correlated with the performances of the methods, as the principle indicates. With out-degree this is not so clear though. This explains the few configurations in Fig. 3 (a) that do not improve when we remove the normalization: all of them normalize by the sum of the weights of the outgoing links of the candidate users. Similar trends are observed in other networks.",

We have found that, in general, the properties of the IR models are held in the recommendation task when we apply this mapping, unless we use a different definition for the document length from the usual. Empirically, we have conducted several experiments over various Twitter and Facebook networks to check if those axioms have any positive effect on the accuracy of the recommenders. We showed that satisfying the constraints related to term frequencies and term discrimination have a positive impact on the accuracy.
