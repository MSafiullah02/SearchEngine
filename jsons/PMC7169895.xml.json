In month of december 2019 of the breakthrough, there were 16,500 confirmed cases, 360 fatalities and over 20,000 suspected cases in China, with vast majority of cases in Wuhan. However, the COVID-19 has spread internationally, it is breaking out in many countries and also various continents. The quick spread of the coronavirus had caused more than 118,000 cases and 4,291 deaths in 114 countries in March 11, 2020 [2], [3], [4].

It has wide variety of treatment techniques which offers quality of life for the patients. In the same way use of radiation in the present scenario for the treatment of corona virus is a provoking idea to manage the disease outbreak. Radiation may play a major role increasing the overall survival of the patients and to control the disease. As we know radiation can control the growth malignant tumor to a greater extent by cell killing mechanism [6]. Our idea is to implement the radiation for de-activating the COVID-19 cells in terms of delivering some minimum dose (in terms of Gray) to the patient. COVID-19 virus mainly affects the respiratory system resulting in difficulty in breathing and it is contained in lungs. So, the patient can be diagnosed with some suitable imaging modality which can be further used for the treatment planning procedures. Based on the patient condition and the stage treatment plan can be created and executed.",
