Among the CoV's known to cause human disease, the three most highly pathogenic of the group include the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV now named SARS-CoV-1) [2], the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3] and SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, identified in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China [4]. Early prodromal symptoms of infection with COVID-19 include anosmia, hyposmia and dysgeusia [5] followed days later by fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%) and shortness of breath, fatigue (75.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea (39.6%) [6]. A sore throat, headache, myalgias and rarely conjunctivitis has also been reported [7] as well as episodes of confusion [8]. This is similar to the clinical picture of MERS, where a fever, chills, cough, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, myalgia, chest pain, gastro\u2010intestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) and confusion may result [9].",

Mortality among these critically ill patients was high. The ICU mortality rate among those who required non-invasive ventilation in one case series in China was 79% and among those who required invasive mechanical ventilation was 86% [15]. The fundamental pathophysiology of infection with COVID-19 potentially resulting in such critical outcomes is \u201ccytokine storm syndrome\u201d with ARDS and fulminate myocarditis [20] with multiorgan dysfunction [7] acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and pneumothorax [21]. A hyperinflammatory syndrome known as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) can also result from fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia [22]. Pulmonary involvement in patients with HLH/MAS revealed that dyspnea and cough were the most common symptoms at the onset of the disease, and radiographs revealed interstitial infiltrates with centrilobular nodules, ill-defined consolidation, or localized ground-glass opacities [23]. Similar radiological abnormalities are seen in patients who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia, where initial lung findings on chest CT revealed small subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO) that grew larger with crazy-paving pattern and consolidation up to two weeks after disease onset, eventually being absorbed resulting in extensive GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands [24]. Chest radiographs and imaging results of patients with MERS Cov also have also shown features that resemble the findings of organizing pneumonia, which are different however from SARS, which show more of a fibrocellular intra\u2010alveolar organization with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia\u2010like pattern [9].",

Neutrophils are recruited to the lungs by these cytokines, which then become activated and release toxic mediators [36], leading to extensive free radical production and reactive oxygen species which overwhelms endogenous anti-oxidants resulting in oxidative cell damage to lung tissue [37]. Pharmacological therapies that have been tried to date include nitric oxide, inhaled prostacycline, vasoconstrictors and anti-inflammatory agents including corticosteroids. Corticosteroids, however, have been shown to have no benefit and even cause harm [33].",

These levels are substantially increased by therapy with intravenous NAC with measurable clinical responses to treatment regarding increased oxygen delivery, improved lung compliance and resolution of pulmonary edema [45]. The alveolar epithelial lining fluid of patients with ARDS has also been shown to be deficient in total GSH compared to normal subjects, where reactive oxygen species may play a key role in the pathogenesis of the acute lung injury with ARDS [46]. Since patients with ARDS are subjected to an increased burden of oxidants in the alveolar fluid, principally released by recruited neutrophils, this deficiency of GSH may predispose these patients to enhanced lung cell injury. Glutathione is one of the body's master antioxidants which has been shown to play an important role in antioxidant defense, nutrient metabolism, and regulation of cellular events, including cytokine production and immune response [47]. We therefore performed a trial of glutathione precursors, i.e. NAC, antioxidants (alpha lipoic acid, Vitamin C) along with 2-g doses of PO and/or IV glutathione in 2 patients suffering from dyspnea associated with COVID-19 pneumonia who were previously on antibiotic treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia with mixed results.",

These are some of the same cytokines expressed during viral infection with COVID-19 [24]. Glutathione and alkalizing the body to decrease acidic byproducts has been shown to be helpful in decreasing symptomatology in this population of patients [57]. Glutathione metabolism has also been discovered to be the most important target of B. burgdorferi infection, and this pathway is essential for cytokine production, likely through glutathionylation [58]. Glutathione and GSH precursors (NAC) with antioxidants that help regenerate GSH (alpha lipoic acid) have been an effective mainstay of treating cytokine storms and Herxheimer reactions in our tick-borne population for decades [[59], [60]]. Both patients took glutathione for the first time on day ten/eleven, during the peak stage of their illness. According to recent published research [61], patients without severe respiratory distress during the disease course have lung abnormalities on chest CT of greatest severity approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms. Both patients therefore had significant benefit with high-dose oral glutathione relieving their dyspnea during the peak stage of their illness.",

Other effects of Vitamin C include increased functioning of phagocytes, proliferation of T-lymphocytes and production of interferon, while decreasing the replication of viruses [67]. Alpha lipoic was administered simultaneously with Vitamin C, which apart from being an antioxidant and inhibiting airway inflammation [41], increases GSH through release from oxidized glutathione, increasing GSH synthesis, while activating the transcription factor Nrf2, and lowering expression of NF-kappa B [68]. Finally, NAC, a precursor of glutathione, was given at PO doses ranging from 1200 to 2400 mg/day, as it has been shown to lower the inflammatory response in patients with community acquired pneumonia in a randomized controlled trial [69] while increasing intracellular GSH and improving acute respiratory distress syndrome [70].",

The first, GCS (gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthesase (ligase) is rate limiting and normally functions at substantially less than its maximum capacity because of feedback inhibition by GSH, while responding rapidly to GSH requirements [47]. In addition, GSH synthesis increases dramatically with oxidative stress through increase GCS transcription via Nrf2, providing there is adequate availability of cysteine, the rate limiting substrate [70]. Our patients took two Nrf2 activators, curcurmin and sulforaphane glucosinolate. Nrf2 suppresses macrophage inflammatory response by blocking proinflammatory cytokine transcription [72], and both curcumin and sulforaphane are potent Nrf2 activators that have been shown to decrease a broad range of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 [73], helping to lower inflammation [[74], [75]].",

It is therefore possible that by administering large doses of NAC and glutathione, along with zinc, Vitamin C and Nrf2 activators, we lowered oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production, resulting in a rapid improvement in dyspnea and clinical symptomatology. A limitation of our study, apart from the small sample size however, is that we were unable to do laboratory testing in our patients, including checking oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxides) as well as inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and LDH which might demonstrate a change post GSH administration [[76], [77], [78]].

            "text": "Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been shown to be required for transcription of the genes for many of the pro-inflammatory mediators associated with ARDS. An intact inflammatory response, in which NF-\u03baB plays a major role, is also required for appropriate host defense against viruses [79] and in the later stages of bacterial pneumonia [80]. In preclinical models of sepsis and acute lung injury, associated with rapid and large increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, suppression of NF-\u03baB activation has been shown to result in improved survival [[81], [82]]. NAC, alpha-lipoic acid and GSH all inhibit TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-kappaB activation. Oral and IV glutathione as well as glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine, alpha-lipoic acid) may, therefore, represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NFKappaB and addressing \u201ccytokine storm syndrome\u201d and respiratory distress in patients suffering with COVID 19 pneumonia. Zinc, vitamin C and NRF 2 activators may also be helpful in decreasing the inflammatory response and lowering cytokine production. Randomized controlled trials should be performed to evaluate the efficacy of these novel therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS.",
