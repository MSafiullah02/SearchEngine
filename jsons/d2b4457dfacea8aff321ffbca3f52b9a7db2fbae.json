Host shifting, that is the colonization of a new host species by a 55 pathogen, requires a certain level of overlap in species traits ('ecological fitting') in order to 56 overcome barriers of cross-species transmission and for survival and reproduction within 57 novel host species [3] [4] [5] . In the search for mechanisms and enabling conditions that may help 58 to predict the future emergence of infectious diseases from animal populations, the necessity 59 of considering entire host species communities amongst underpinning biogeographic 60 structure and connectivity have been recently emphasized [6] [7] [8] [9] . 61 Network analyses that describe the connections of different host species in terms of 62 parasite sharing have proven useful in analysing host specificity and parasite spread [10, 11] , 63 particularly since they offer the opportunity to explore community-wide pathogen spread (the 64 distribution of a pathogen among host species, a pattern emerging from past and 65 contemporary host shifting events that connect host species as nodes in a network). Such 66 approaches may lead to increased predictability of future pandemics; for example, some 67 recent \"big data\" studies of mammal-virus associations have explored whether host traits and 68 geographic distribution can predict those species to most likely harbour undiscovered viruses 69 that may cause future pandemics [11] [12] [13] . virus sharing across entire communities became only recently available [12, 15] amid the 78 challenge that many virus species remain unknown [16] . 79 We address this knowledge gap by exploring the role of different mammalian species 80 in the spread of viruses through entire host communities. In particular, we tested whether [17] and were 85 recently reported to play crucial roles in the sharing of helminth parasites between humans 86 and wildlife [9] . Moreover, the large numbers of domestic animals compared to those of 87 wildlife [18] , and close contact between them and people, creates ground for frequent and 88 multilateral exposure. For entire networks of viruses and mammalian host associations, we 89 also expect that virus sharing differ between the two different genome types of DNA and 90 RNA viruses. Faster replication and higher genetic diversity in RNA viruses have been 91 proposed to likely increases their host range through more frequent host shifting and 92 adaptation to distantly related host species, whereas DNA viruses and retroviruses are 93 assumed to be more host-specific due to codivergence with their hosts over much longer 94 evolutionary timescales [19] [20] [21] [22] . Yet, to date little comprehensive work has been conducted 95 of whether host sharing and spread at the network level differ among these viruses and 96 whether they interact with the various groups of mammals in different ways. We used 97 network centrality analysis and Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the extent of virus ",

We addressed these aims using three different statistical approaches, which we 196 describe in detail in the SI Appendix. In brief, we used the following statistical approaches: We used the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to assess whether the eigenvector centrality 208 measures differed between wildlife and domestic species and among host orders. We applied 209 Dunn's test for multiple comparisons [36] . To account for sampling bias that could bias 210 centrality measures [37] , we randomly removed subsets of interaction records from the Hierarchical model of virus sharing among host species 219 We generated a binary N\u00d7N adjacency matrix with z(i,j) = 1 if the pair of host species i and j 220 were recorded to share any virus and z(i,j) = 0 otherwise (with i and j \uf0ce 1,\u2026,N and j \u2260 i). The 221 probability \uf06a(i,j) that two host species share any virus can be linked to z(i,j) with a Bernoulli 222 distribution given as 224 We used the logit-link function to model variation in \uf06a(i,j ) as",

However, despite this uncertainty in which host species 295 occupied the most central positions, the findings of significant larger centrality measures for 296 domestic than wildlife species hold true for all subsets (all Kruskal-Wallis tests with \uf0632 \u2265 297 16.5, df= 1, p < 0.01) (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). prominent role of domestic animals in virus sharing across the entire network. 302 Wild mammalian host species were ca. 10 times (95% credible intervals [CIs] of odds ratio 303 8.7 -15.5) more likely to share virus species with humans and ca. 6 times (odds ratio 6 -6.8) 304 more likely to share virus species with domestic animals than with any other wild species. 305 Any pair of domestic species was ca. 84 times (odds ratio: 55 -141) more likely to share 306 viruses than any pair of two wildlife species. We found the highest frequencies of virus 307 sharing for RNA viruses shared among species of the orders Carnivora and Chiroptera 308 (averaging frequencies of 1.2 -3.4% according to CIs of sharing RNA viruses with other 309 species), whereas DNA virus sharing frequencies were below 0.7% (according to all upper 310 bounds of CIs) for all host orders (figure 3). For all host orders and both virus genome types, 311 we found virus sharing to be more likely with closely related species (negative values for 312 coefficients \u03b2phyl that depict increasing virus sharing for smaller phylogenetic distances 313 among pairs of host species). Phylogenetic clustering of host species (which translates into 314 higher host specificity for the viruses) was stronger for DNA viruses shared by Primates, 315 Lagomorpha, Artiodactyla and Chiroptera compared to RNA viruses (figure 3), signifying a 316 general tendency of higher host specificity in terms of phylogenetic similarity for DNA 317 viruses compared to RNA viruses. Notably, phylogenetic host specificity for RNA viruses 318 shared by Primates were relatively low, suggesting host sharing with phylogenetically 319 distantly related host species (figure 3). Functional distance among host species were 320 generally less meaningful in describing patterns of virus sharing among pairs of host species, 321 but we found virus sharing for Primates, Rodentia, Artiodactyla and Chiroptera with other 322 hosts to increase with increasing functional distance (positive values for coefficients \u03b2ecol that 323 depict increasing virus sharing for larger functional distances) (figure 3). Virus sharing 324 14 among host species increased with all four proxies of sampling bias for both DNA Proportion of zoonotic viruses in different host species 329 We found the taxa Primates to harbour the overall largest proportions of zoonotic viruses 330 with a group-level average of 54% (CI of 44 -64% according to \u00b5order) (figure 4), followed 331 by slightly lower proportion of zoonotic viruses in Rodentia, Carnivora, Artiodactyla and 332 Chiroptera (all CIs ranging between 14 -46%) (figure 4). The proportion of zoonotic viruses 333 carried by domestic species was 1.2 times higher than in wildlife (odds ratio of 2.2 and CI of 334 1.5 -3). RNA virus species accounted for the highest proportions of zoonotic viruses in all 335 mammalian groups, averaging to 46% (CI of 17 -65% according to hyperprior HRNA) 336 compared to only 7% (CI of 2 -25% according to hyperprior HDNA) of the DNA viruses in 337 mammalian hosts being zoonotic. 338 We found the proportion of zoonotic RNA viruses in different host species to increase 339 with the numbers of litters per year (odds ratio of 1.1 -1.6) and larger range area (odds ratio 340 of 1.02 -1.3), while it decreased with increasing longevity (odds ratio of 0.5 -0.8) and 341 decreased in open vegetation (odds ratio of 0.5 -0.99). In contrast, there was no evidence 342 that the proportion of zoonotic DNA viruses in different host species was linked to any 343 species traits (all odds ratio estimates intersecting with 1). The proportion of zoonotic RNA 344 viruses was smaller for host species, with the largest number of sequences recorded and 345 higher Shannon diversity scores of sequence records (both odds ratios between 0.7 -0.96), 346 suggesting that more intensive sequencing efforts of a large range of these viruses increases 347 the discovery of viruses confined to non-human hosts. The proportion of DNA virus species between host species from different mammalian orders and viruses from 351 different families is illustrated in electronic supplementary material, figure S4, data are 352 presented in electronic supplementary material, table S2. and the emergence of infectious diseases ultimately depend on how 356 pathogens conquer eco-evolutionary barriers to infect novel hosts [39], but spatiotemporal 357 variation in species interaction and pathogen transmission opportunities are proximately 358 driven by host occurrences and community assembly [40, 41]. It comes therefore as little 359 surprise that globally pervasive mammal groups, such as bats and rodents, are often 360 considered to share as many viruses with humans as do primates, our closest relatives [12, 42, 361 43]. Our study adds novel insights into viruses spread across mammalian communities. 362 Specifically, we provide the strongest evidence to date that domestic animals are the most 363 central species in mammalian host-virus interaction networks. We also found rather 364 distinctive patterns of how DNA and RNA viruses are shared and spread among different 365 mammalian groups, with bats and carnivores being only of minor role in spreading DNA 366 viruses through the network. We emphasize the dominant role of domestic species in virus 367 sharing, since domestication status strongly increases the chance of virus sharing among 368 multiple mammalian hosts. Likewise, we found domestic species also to carry larger 369 proportions of zoonotic viruses than 'equivalent' wildlife species after accounting for 370 phylogeny and other traits.",

However, the exceptionally high virus sharing of humans and domestic animals with 382 other mammalian species suggest that these species play a crucial role in spreading viruses,383 as frequent virus acquisition and dissemination is the most plausible explanation for such 384 intensive virus sharing. This may reflect the wide geographic distribution and contact 385 opportunities to wildlife across biogeographic borders, given that domestic species are not 386 particularly distinguished from wildlife in terms of ecological traits. In fact, contact 387 opportunity and community assembly have been shown in a number of studies to impact 388 pathogen sharing and host shifting [8, 45]. Many pathogens, including viruses, can overcome 389 species and environmental barriers to infect distantly related hosts and disperse across large 390 geographic areas [46, 47], although strong constraints in host shifting may also cause 391 biogeographic structure in pathogen diversity and zoonotic disease risk [6, 48]. Beside the 392 large geographic ranges and diverse habitats encroached by domestic species, their large 393 populations sizes and high densities, that often excels those of wildlife populations [18], 394 could further contribute to host shifting and pathogen spread. This could be especially the 395 case if large population sizes facilitate contact opportunity, virus amplification and 396 diversification caused by more intensive within-population transmission or other factors, 397 warranting future research.398 Our findings of larger proportions of zoonotic RNA viruses compared to DNA viruses carried 399 in different mammals is consistent with previous research [12, 19, 49] and is in line with our 400 finding that mammal species generally share RNA viruses more frequently with other hosts 401 than DNA viruses. Here, we reveal for the first time that these two major groups of viruses 402 are differently spread across entire networks of mammalian hosts, an important finding that 403 remains largely unnoticed when solely looking at the species richness and propensity of 404 zoonotic viruses carried in different wildlife species. Remarkably, Chiroptera and Carnivora 405 hold central positions in terms of virus sharing with other species only for RNA viruses, 406 while Primates occupy relatively more central positions in terms of DNA virus sharing 407 among hosts. In practice, these findings translate into a minor role of bats and carnivores for 408 the spread of DNA viruses (and relatively low risk that DNA viruses will spillover from these 409 species to humans), whereas at least a few primate species, namely Macaca mulatta, Pan 410 troglodytes, Chlorocebus aethiops and M. fascicularis, have relatively more central roles in 411 sharing DNA than RNA viruses. We also found that cattle (Bos taurus), goat (Capra hircus), 412 pig (Sus scrofa), horse (Equus caballus) and sheep (Ovis aries), which are globally the most 413 abundant and economically important livestock species [50], are among those species with 414 the relatively highest centrality measures in terms of DNA virus sharing. Importantly though, 415 it should be noted that for all these species, the frequencies of sharing DNA viruses with 416 other host species was considerably lower than sharing RNA viruses regardless of centrality 417 measures (as is also true for group-level estimates for different mammalian orders as depicted 418 in figure 3). We thus emphasize that aforementioned species have a relative crucial role in 419 spreading DNA viruses, whereas RNA viruses generally are much more frequently shared 420 among mammalian host species. In this context, our model framework for analysing patterns 421 in host sharing provides probabilistic estimates of the variation in the pairwise phylogenetic 422 and functional similarities of infected versus potential host species as a signal of host 423 18 specificity. This tool enables us to quantify host specificity of DNA versus RNA viruses in 424 different groups of hosts, resulting in refined and community-wide measures of previously 425 notified higher host specificity in DNA viruses compared to RNA viruses [19-21]. 426 The understanding of virological factors that ensure efficient virus replication and 427 transmission within and among host species is in its infancy [51]. Consequently, 428 disentangling host or virus traits as drivers of the differential spread of DNA and RNA 429 viruses among different mammalian orders is currently not possible and requires fundamental 430 research. Possible working hypotheses as to why primates and ungulates are of relatively high 431 central importance in sharing DNA viruses could be linked to mechanisms that enable 432 efficient within-host virus replication and population-level transmission. At the same time, 433 exploring virus attributes of the major DNA virus families shared among these host species, 434 namely Herpesviridae, Papillomavirridae and Adenovirridae (electronic supplementary 435 material, figure S4), may help to explain why these viruses are more likely to be shared by 436 primates and ungulates but are less likely to cross host species barrier with regards to bats and 437 carnivores. Moreover, the strong links of some RNA viruses such as the Bunyavirales to 438 arthropod vectors [52], requires further research into the role of host-vector associations and 439 other transmission modes for the spread of viruses. 440 We recognize several shortfalls in analysing database records of host-pathogen 441 associations. First, any record of a virus species in a host entirely relies on targeted molecular 442 screening. Certain research foci such as the boost in coronavirus research linked to bats after 443 the SARS pandemics [14] may include a sampling bias difficult to capture when only 444 accounting for publication or sequencing numbers as proxies for sampling bias, since the true 445 presence/absence of viruses in non-target host species remains unknown. Undoubtedly, major 446 research efforts are linked to viruses of public health relevance, while there is a dearth of 447 systematic pathogen surveillances in wildlife [53]. Second, detecting a pathogen in any 448 targeted host species depends on its prevalence in its host population and the number of 449 sampled host individuals but such information cannot be retrieved from database records. 450 With sparse data, any direct interpretation of absolute numbers of species richness and 451 interactions could rather reflect the observation process than true biological patterns and 452 processes [26], and we are therefore currently not able to explore such important properties in 453 our study. Network topologies can be also biased by sampling and data aggregation [54]. We 454 control for research effort in our analysis by accounting for variation in relation to 455 publications and sequencing numbers, as has been done previously [10, 12]. However, as 456 more complete data from systematic disease surveillance efforts becomes available, it will be 457 desirable to improve such analysis to better distinguish true but undiscovered interactions 458 from 'false zeros' among other sources of bias. Finally, we are aware that amalgamating 459 species-specific host-pathogen interactions into N\u00d7N adjacency matrix as used for some 460 network statistics comes at the cost of losing information about pathogen species identity and 461 thus overall connectivity of host species can no longer be traced back to particular pathogen 462 species. Overall, network connectivity and modularity are therefore community-level entities, 463 while a focus on particular virus species would require more detailed analysis of underlying 464 species-level interaction matrices. 465 Our work reveals the importance of domestication status and phylogenetic clustering 466 on the importance of virus sharing among mammals, showcasing also the limited sharing of 467 DNA viruses by bats and carnivores in contrast to primates and ungulates species that readily 468 share both RNA and DNA viruses. The emergence of novel infectious diseases through 469 pathogen spillover is a hierarchical process. Ecological factors that determine the contact 470 opportunity between different host species pave the way for cross-species transmission, host 471 adaptation and subsequent within-host reproduction and transmission, which are then largely 472 controlled by ecophysiological and genetic factors. Future work that better accounts for virus 473 20 factors and host species community assembly may shed further light on why different types 474 of viruses spread differently among phylogenetic and functional groups of mammals and 475 foster better predictions of future disease emergence. 476 477 Data accessibility statement: The data reported in this paper will be deposited at Dryad 478 (https://datadryad.org/).",
