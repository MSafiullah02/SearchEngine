The most extensively used tools are rapid antigen detection tests (RDTs) [1], [2]. RDTs are simple, fast (10\u201315 min), and suitable for point-of-care screening. Nevertheless, many reports stress the limited sensitivity and specificity of RDTs [2], [3], [4], [5], and RDT results are yet to be confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

Briefly, RPA primers (420 nM), the probe (120 nM), 45 \u03bcl of rehydration buffer containing 14 mM Mg acetate, and 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA were added.

To determine the limit of detection at 95% probability, a probit regression was performed using STATISTICA (StatSoft, Hamburg, Germany). The specificity of RT-RPA assays was determined by testing six H7N9-negative chicken samples and a reference human genome.

In addition, infected cases were reported in Taiwan and Malaysia [18], suggesting the spread of the virus to other countries as well.

However, RT-LAMP needs six to 12 primers for the amplification of the H7 and N9 genes, which are not easy to design especially for highly variable RNA viruses. By contrast, the H7N9 RT-RPA assays developed in this study were very fast (2\u20137 min). They were operated at a single temperature (42 \u00b0C), and only four primers and two exo-Ps were needed for the amplification and detection of two genes (H7 and N9). Moreover, the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assays were as good as that of the published real-time-RT-PCR [16].",

The system can be used with a solar panel and/or power pack as a source of energy for easy use in low-resource settings. All RT-RPA reagents and oligonucleotides can be stored at ambient temperature for up to 3 months. RNA extraction is achieved by a magnetic-bead-based method, which reduces the risk of environmental contamination because no centrifugation step is needed. Six samples can be tested at the same time, in addition to negative and positive controls. Kits for up to 98 samples can be stored in the DiaS. The DiaS storage box can be refilled whenever needed. Results are displayed as positive or negative on the screen of the tube scanner without the need of a laptop. Overall, nine pipetting steps are needed. Further improvements to reduce the pipetting steps could be to include lyophilized RPA primers and probe into the RPA pellet, to employ a multiplex RT-RPA assay, and to apply simple non-purification lysis. In addition, generic influenza RT-RPA assays for detection of influenza type A and B as well as H5N1 are being developed, but they have not yet been included [25].",
