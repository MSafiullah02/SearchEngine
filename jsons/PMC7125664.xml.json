            "text": "Sapelovirus A (PSV), formerly porcine sapelovirus, is a member of the family Picornaviridae of the Sapelovirus genus. Like other Picornaviridae, PSV is a single stranded, positive-sense non-enveloped RNA virus. The PSV genome contains a single open reading frame which consists of four structural proteins (VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1) and flanked by non-translated regions at both ends. The VP1, VP2 and VP3 proteins locate at the surface of the virion, expose to the immune system and exhibit the high sequence variability (Sozzi et al., 2010). PSV can be readily cultivated in pig kidney cells, including PK-15, IBRS-2 and LLC-PK (Lan et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2016). Among cell lines from other species, two PSV strains Jpsv477 and Jpsv1315 are found to replicate in human hepatocarcinoma cell line (PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2/C3a) and green monkey kidney cell line (Vero E6 and PGMKC) (Bai et al., 2018). Infections by PSV is involved in a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to clinical symptoms including acute diarrhea, polioencephalomyelitis, pneumonia and reproductive disorders (Arruda et al., 2017, Lan et al., 2011). Over the past decade, numerous outbreaks and high prevalence have occurred throughout the world (Schock et al., 2014, Son et al., 2014, Arruda et al., 2017), causing high morbidity and case fatality rate in the USA (Arruda et al., 2017). Currently, no specific treatment for PSV is available, although monosaccharide N-acetylneuraminic acid has the ability to block virus binding and infection (Kim et al., 2016). Additionally, researches regarding the mechanism of PSV entry and infection are not well exposited, and a detailed study of the endocytic mechanism involved in PSV uptake is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Most viruses utilize existing cellular endocytic pathways to enter and infect cells. These endocytic mechanisms mainly include clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveolar-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis and clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis (Mercer et al., 2010). Among them, CME is the major endocytic pathway, and is involved in cargo selection and vesicle budding (McMahon and Boucrot, 2011). This pathway encompasses the internalization of viruses, nutrients, growth factors and receptors (Tian et al., 2014, Kawaguchi et al., 2016, Li et al., 2017). CME is independent of lipid rafts, and disruption of actin which means restraining phagocytosis or macropinocytosis may affect this pathway (Merrifield et al., 2005). Caveolae are formed by integral membrane proteins known as caveolins and a coat complex of several caveolin proteins (Ariotti and Parton, 2013) and are associated with various cellular functions, including cell signaling, membrane tension and substrate adhesion (Echarri and Del Pozo, 2015, Sohn et al., 2018). Caveolae-dependent endocytosis has been reported to be implicated in host cell entry by Japanese encephalitis virus (Xu et al., 2016), canine respiratory coronavirus (Szczepanski et al., 2018) and peste des petits ruminants virus (Yang et al., 2018).",

Similarly, both reagents inhibited viral protein synthesis both at inhibitor pretreated and post treated (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, virus titer assay was performed on cells treated with NH4Cl or CQ at 1 h before PSV inoculation, which revealed that cellular endosome acidification also had a significant effect on PSV entry into PK-15 cells and NH4Cl or CQ dose-dependently decreased virus entry or replication (Fig. 1C). To further examine and validate the pH dependence of PSV infections, IFA was performed. The relative infection rates of PSV as monitored by IFA were also inhibited at different concentrations of NH4Cl or CQ (Fig. 1D).

Uptake assays first demonstrated that Tfn uptake was effectively inhibited by 10 \u03bcM CPZ (\nFig. 2A). The effect of CPZ on PSV entry was then detected by western blot. Unexpectedly, no obvious difference of PSV VP1 synthesis was found in the cells treated with 2, 10 or 50 \u03bcM CPZ before or after virus infection compared to that in the untreated control cells (Fig. 2B). We next examined the effects of CPZ on virus internalization and virus titer, and found that treatment of PK-15 cells with different concentrations of CPZ did not affect virus progeny production or virus internalization (Fig. 2C). No significant difference was found of the virus titer between cells treated with 50 \u03bcM CPZ (105.44/100 \u03bcl) and that of untreated cells (106.03/100 \u03bcl). In a different approach, we investigated the effect of silencing the expression of CHC on PSV uptake and infection. First, PK-15 cells were transfected with siRNA negative control or siRNA targeting CHC for 28 h and then infected with PSV for 8 h. We found that siCHC could specifically decrease the RNA copies of CHC (by 82.5%, Fig. 2D), whereas no significant facilitation of PSV VP1 synthesis was observed (Fig. 2E). The functionality of Eps15 WT and EPS15 DN constructs was confirmed in PK-15 cells by using labeled transferrin as a control (Shi et al., 2016). We then examined PSV infections of cells overexpressing the Eps15 WT and Eps15 DN constructs and no effect was observed on PSV VP1 production with any of the constructs (Fig. 2F). Collectively, these results indicate that PSV is capable of entering and infecting PK-15 cells lacking a functional CME pathway.",

Tfn uptake assay showed that 10 \u03bcM dynasore could effectively inhibited the internalization of Tfn by PK-15 cells (\nFig. 4A). To investigate whether dynamin is involved in PSV entry and infection, the effect of dynasore, a GTPase inhibitor that targets dynamin-1 and \u22122 (Macia et al., 2006), was tested by using western blot and virus titer assay. Data obtained from western blot suggested that virus VP1 protein synthesis was significantly affected in PK-15 cells pretreated with different concentrations of dynasore (Fig. 4B). However, no obvious effect on VP1 protein expression was found between post treated dynasore and mock-treated cells. We next examined the effects of different concentrations of dynasore on virus titers and virus internalization, and the results indicated that pretreating PK-15 cells with 10 \u03bcM or 40 \u03bcM dynasore significantly decreased PSV titers and viral RNA copy numbers (Fig. 4C).",

Furthermore, through regulating actin polymerization as well as remodeling plasma membrane, intersectin-2L could regulate caveolae endocytosis (Klein et al., 2009). To test whether PSV utilize actin-driven transport to entry cell, PK-15 cells were mock-treated or infected with PSV and then actin was examined using phalloidin staining. In mock-treated cells, the actin stress fibers arranged in order and were visible. In virus-treated cells, actin cytoskeleton depolymerization was found, following decreased actin stress fibers and more transient blebs at cell surface (\nFig. 6A). To further demonstrate the active role of the actin network in PSV replication, we used actin-specific inhibitor cytochalasin D (Cyto D), which blocks the polymerization of new actin filaments (Taylor et al., 2011), and jasplakinolide (Jasp), which reduces actin dynamics (Wang et al., 2014). We identified that disruption of actin filaments with 20 \u03bcM Cyto D led to about 2.03-fold increase in VP1 protein synthesis (Fig. 6B). Similarly, Jasp resulted in 1.25-fold increase in VP1 protein synthesis (Fig. 6C). Additionally, treatment of PK-15 cells with 20 \u03bcM Cyto D or 0.5 \u03bcM Jasp significantly increased PSV titers compared to those in mock-treated cells (Fig. 6D,E). Together, these results indicate that inhibition of actin filament polymerization needed for dynamic actin remodeling in PK-15 cells could stimulate PSV replication.",

Pharmacological inhibitors were first used to inhibit corresponding pathways, and specificity was assessed by using highly specific DN mutant plasmids and siRNA knockdown to verify the results. Among the endocytic pathways taken by viruses, CME is the most commonly used. Clathrin transports a large variety of different cargoes from the plasma membrane in response to receptor-mediated endocytosis signals, and it is composed of a clathrin light chain and a clathrin heavy chain (Halebian et al., 2017). In clathrin-mediated endocytosis, vesicle scission is accelerated by the large GTPase dynamin, which involves the dynamic function of dynamin-2 at the neck of the clathrin-coated pit (Ferguson et al., 2016). Our results indicate that through transfecting siRNAs targeting CHC, we reduced clathrin expression in PK-15 cells without affecting PSV infection. Furthermore, the EPS15 DN mutant and dynamin DN mutant does not inhibit PSV VP1 expression or virus titer, suggesting that PSV enters PK-15 cells is CME and dynamin-independent endocytosis.",

Similarly, in Cav1-deficient murine cells, caveolae formation was abrogated (Drab et al., 2001). Our data demonstrated that cholesterol depletion suppressed PSV infection, implying the importance of the fluidity of cholesterol during PSV entry and replication. Together with the evidence that knockdown of Cav1 and overexpression of DN mutant of Cav1 were also an inhibition to PSV proliferation, our findings indicate that PSV can use a caveolae-mediated endocytosis and most likely by altering the integrity of membrane lipid to initiate a productive infection.",

            "text": "Macropinocytosis is a transient, actin-dependent cellular process normally involved in fluid uptake. Usually, macropinocytosis is featured by actin and microfilament-mediated cell plasma membrane ruffling and blebbing activation (Mercer and Helenius, 2009). We did not observe typical inhibitors of macropinocytosis (EIPA) influenced PSV infection, as no effect was measurable in PSV VP1 expression level or virus titer. After disruption of the cellular actin network through exposure to pharmacological inhibitors CytoD and Jasp, PSV infection was unperturbed but strongly enhanced by CytoD and Jasp. Disruption of the dynamic function of the actin network with CytoD and Latrunculin-B leads to about 2.5-fold increase in tomato bushy stunt virus replication in infected cells (Nawaz-ul-Rehman et al., 2016). The mechanism is that tomato bushy stunt virus regulates the functions of cofilin, which leads to inhibition of the dynamic function of the actin network, and this induces virus to utilize the existing actin filaments to efficiently recruit host proteins and lipids for viral replication (Nawaz-ul-Rehman et al., 2016). However, the specific mechanism on inhibition of actin filament polymerization stimulates PSV replication whether due to dynamic actin remodeling in PK-15 cells is unclear. Thus, further studies are still needed to clarify it.",

Notable among endocytic Rab GTPases are Rab5, which functions in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, clathrin-coated vesicles fusion with early endosomes and in the homotypic fusion between early endosomes (Bucci et al., 1992, McLauchlan et al., 1998); Rab7, which acts downstream from Rab5 to regulate transport from early to late endosomes and lysosomes (Vitelli et al., 1997, Jager et al., 2004); Rab9, which regulates endosome to trans-Golgi network transport (Lombardi et al., 1993); and Rab11, which controls the transport along the recycling pathway, from early and recycling endosomes to the cell surface (Ullrich et al., 1996). A previous study demonstrates that bluetongue virus utilizes the late endosome-specific lipid factor lysobisphosphatidic acid for viral entry but not early endosome (Patel et al., 2016). In this study, the effects of Rabs protein on virus entry were detected, and we found that both transfection with siRNA Rab7 (or Rab11) and expression of DN mutant of Rab7 (or Rab11) could decrease PSV VP1 expression levels, while the expression of DN Rab5 or DN Rab9 construct was no effect of on viral infection. We speculate that Rab7 and Rab11 activity and functional late endocytic pathways and the recycling pathway are required for effective PSV infection.",
