However, few studies have investigated factors that might attenuate the impact of stress on these negative outcomes. We investigated whether the tendency to be kind to the self during times of difficulty-self-compassion-might buffer the effect of work stress on outcomes. Methods Registered nurses (n = 801), physicians (n = 516), and medical students (n = 383) were recruited using convenience sampling in New Zealand. Following consent, participants (N = 1700) completed a survey including the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form.",

Self-compassion moderated the relationship between stress and burnout in nurses (albeit in the opposite direction to what had been predicted), but not in doctors or medical students. Conclusions While self-compassion predicted better outcomes (and may thus represent a target to enhance wellbeing), it strengthened the association between stress and burnout in nurses. How self-compassion impacts the experience of stress and its correlates and why it does so differently in different groups of professionals remains unclear.",

Given differences in caseloads, timeframes, and work-related challenges, the sources of work-related stress also likely differ (Eltarhuni 2016) . Compared to doctors, nurses occupy positions with lower power (Daiski 2004) as do more recent graduates. Lower work-related autonomy may be particularly salient in ward environments (Mantzoukas & Jasper 2004) or for more recent trainees (Law & Chan 2015) . Consequently, the sources of stress may differ between physicians and nurses as well as between more versus less-experienced workers. Professional development, experience, seniority, and ageing may lead to a greater tolerance of perceived failures, complexity, and ambiguity, and greater emotional maturity (Moltu, Binder, & Nielsen 2010) , allowing more experienced clinicians (or those with more control over stressors) to more effectively manage stress and/or recognize their lack of infallibility. Thus, although it is unknown at this point, such differences create the possibility that the links between stress and burnout may differ in different groups of workers and/or that self-compassion may have different implications at different stages of development.",

Based on prior work, it was hypothesised that greater stress would predict greater burnout and lower QOL, that greater self-compassion would predict lower burnout and greater QOL, and that self-compassion would buffer (i.e., weaken) the association between stress and outcomes (burnout and QOL). We treat the possibility of differential moderation across groups as an exploratory question.",

            "text": "In extending prior research examining how stress may contribute to burnout and impaired QOL in healthcare worker populations and testing for possible protective factors, this study found the expected association in which greater stress predicted greater burnout and lower QOL in all three groups, albeit with some variation in magnitude. In seeking to identify resiliency-type factors that might buffer against the ill-effects of stress, analyses suggested that greater self-compassion consistently predicted lower burnout and greater QOL in all three groups although the magnitude of this association did vary. However, selfcompassion only moderated the relationship between stress and burnout in the nursing sample and did so in a counterintuitive direction; surprisingly, the 'protective' effect of selfcompassion was reduced at higher levels of stress in this group. Below, these findings are revisited in relation to prior literature, some preliminary interpretations are offered, study limitations are discussed, and directions for future study are given. In terms of the primary findings, greater stress predicted greater burnout and lower QOL across samples of physicians, nurses, and medical students. Prior studies have also found that stress predicts greater burnout (Visser et al. 2003) , and lower QOL (Su et al. 2009 ). Equally consistent with previous literature, self-compassion predicted lower stress (Neely et al. 2009 ), lower burnout (Alkema et al. 2008) , and greater QOL (Van Dam Sheppard, Forsyth, & Earleywine, 2010) across groups, although the strength of the associations varied somewhat. Theory suggests that more self-compassionate individuals manage stress more effectively (Alkema et al. 2008; Vigna, Poehlmann-Tynan, & Koenig 2017) , potentially via a greater reliance on positive cognitive restructuring and less avoidance and escape (Allen & Leary 2010), a greater ability to disengage from unfruitful goal pursuit and redirect energy towards alternative goals (Neely et al. 2009 ), greater selfacceptance and kindness in the face of perceived inadequacy (Neely et al. 2009) , and/or more balanced, adaptive and flexible coping strategies (Kyeong 2013; Sirois, Molnar, & Hirsch 2015) . Although these data are cross-sectional and the exact mechanisms remain unclear, self-compassion consistently predicted better outcomes in all three samples of healthcare workers, suggesting it may be a useful target for intervention in these highly stressed groups.",

            "text": "While little is known about self-compassion in the healthcare professions, it may be that this finding reflects differences between nursing and medicine. Broadly speaking, self-compassion may be considered more important in nursing. Relative to medicine, nursing has been described as having a more compassionfocussed professional culture (Boyle 2011) , with other important differences in power and status (Daiski 2004 ) and the modal personality types gravitating towards the two professions (Hardigan & Cohen 1999 ). Such differences may help create or reinforce differences in how important self-compassion is seen as Note. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; # sex coded such that 0 = male and 1 = female being, how it viewed, and thus how it relates to outcomes across different professional groups. Equally, because compassion is arguably more central to nursing, it may be that nurses are better equipped or trained to recognize the extent to which they are (or are not) being compassionate towards themselves and can provide more accurate self-compassion-related self-report data. Additionally, given that nurses reported greater levels of burnout than physicians and medical students and selfcompassion was more closely associated with burnout at the univariate level amongst nurses, it may be that self-compassion has a greater level of burnout to 'work with' (statistically speaking), allowing the moderation to be significant. However, the fact that the protective effect of self-compassion on stress was reduced at higher stress levels suggests such an interpretation to be unlikely or, at least, incomplete. Finally, although participant sex was covaried in analyses, sex differences in psychological characteristics may also be important. Women generally report lower self-compassion (Neff & McGehee 2010 ), greater stress (Matud 2004 ) and greater burnout (Linzer et al. 2002) than men. Thus, because the nursing sample in the current study was primarily female (93.90%), it is unclear whether the patterns observed in the nursing sample reflect its gender composition or factors specific to nursing itself.",

As noted, however, other studies have found different patterns of moderation. In one study, for example, self-compassion moderated the relationship between academic burnout and psychological well-being such that an association was more strongly evident at higher levels of self-compassion (Kyeong 2013) . In accordance with this study, and contrary to our expectations, greater self-compassion was associated with a stronger relationship between stress and burnout in the current study.",

In beginning to understand and interpret these findings, it is worth recalling univariate differences in the correlates of experience, sex, and self-compassion across the three groups. Specifically, greater experience was only associated with greater QOL in students, but not nurses or physicians, and was associated with lower stress in nurses and medical students, but not physicians. Equally, selfcompassion was associated with lower stress in medical students and physicians, but not nurses (see Table 2 ). Additional differences were found in the magnitude of the association amongst the constructs measured here, with global differences broadly evidenced between nurses versus those from a medical background (physicians and medical trainees). Thus, even at the univariate level, differences in how self-compassion and stress related to other variables were seen.",

Evidence suggests that 'obsessively passionate' people are prone to believing that self-compassion could lead to weakness and mediocrity or prevent them from attaining their goals (Gilbert & Procter 2006; Sutherland et al. 2014 ). Hence, it may be that 'obsessive passion' in nurses leads to a portion of this sample feeling (or reporting) less burnt out as a result (Schellenberg et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "Second, it may be that the sources of stress systematically differ across the three samples. As noted, nurses typically have lower status and control in their working environments and it may be that the sources of stress (e.g., patients, clinical duties, schedules, management) are such that self-kindness is not of benefit. In such a case, the importance of receiving compassion from others should be emphasized further, given its effectiveness in buffering against the depressive effects of self-criticism (Hermanto et al. 2016) . Prior work clearly demonstrates that the effects of controllable vs. uncontrollable stress are different (Breier et al. 1987) , perhaps because control perceptions lead to the belief that future threats can be minimized (Miller 1979) . For example, it has been shown that it is uncontrollable (rather than controllable) events that best predict illness (Stern, McCants, & Pettine 1982) . Although there was no direct measure of controllability in this study, stress was less closely linked to QOL and selfcompassion in nurses ( Table 2 ) perhaps implying that the stressors being experienced by nurses differ in some way from those experienced by doctors or medical students. Thus, while nurses report greater stress and burnout, it may be that their stressors are differentially comprised of events (e.g., administrative complexities, competing job demands, patient issues) over which they have little control. Prima facie, managing the self's response to certain types of internal difficulties via self-compassion may be more relevant or efficacious than for 'events' that have a greater external component or are inherently less controllable.",

            "text": "Although this study makes several useful contributions to the literature and employs a large sample, the extent to which findings will generalize to other populations of healthcare professionals is unclear. The study also has a few major limitations-a reliance on self-report measures, use of a cross-sectional and observational design, use of a nonstandardized three-item measure of work stress, and the absence of measurement specifically identifying the particular types of stress and self-compassion of relevance. Reliance on self-report may inflate the associations amongst measures (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff 2012 ) and measures of work stress, burnout, QOL, and self-compassion may be subject to social desirability, self-presentational, and recall biases (Podsakoff & Organ 1986; Podsakoff et al. 2012) . Although self-compassion and QOL may be difficult to access outside of-self-report, alternate measures such as the Implicit-Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz 1998) or behavioural measures are worth considering. The crosssectional and observational design does not allow the direction of causation in the associations between stress, burnout, QOL, and self-compassion to be determined. The nonstandardized (but face valid) three-item measure of work stress used in the study might not possess the same level of construct or content validity as a broader or more extensively validated measures of stress (such as the Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen 1994) and different types of stress might be more or less usefully managed with self-compassion. Future studies examining the possible stress-moderating effects of self-compassion in healthcare would benefit from incorporating standardized stress measures capturing different types of stress.",

It is also possible that the observed interaction (or lack thereof) between self-compassion and stress in predicting outcomes may be different for different elements of the global self-compassion construct and/or various types of stress. These would be fertile avenues for future research, along with (a) a deeper consideration of how specialization is relevant to the professional dynamics linking stress and self-compassion to outcomes, and (b) a focus on fears regarding selfcompassion (e.g., Hermanto et al. 2016; Miron, Sherrill, & Orcutt 2015) .",
