            "text": "Viruses provide an ideal opportunity to quantify the causal effect of a mutation in a genome on the adaptive evolution of the population. Phenotypic evolution is driven by selection pressure acting on viability and/or reproductive ability. Physiological and developmental processes of higher organisms are robust against genomic mutations (Wagner 2000; Li et al. 2004). Due to this buffering mechanism, genetic variations are preserved in phenotypically normal populations, and it is therefore difficult to establish a causal relationship between genomic mutations and phenotypic alterations (Rutherford 2000). On the other hand, viruses have a simple life cycle, so their adaptive evolution can be explained by a few factors (Beerenwinkel et al. 2002). In viral evolution, mutations in genetic coding sequences may correlate with phenotypic evolution through structural changes in proteins that function at various stages of the life cycle. This enables the simultaneous investigation of the phenotypic and genotypic evolution of viruses by monitoring the structural changes in proteins that are caused by genotypic changes and that are reflected in phenotypic differences.",

The model describes the dynamics of three interacting populations: host cells, viruses, and induced antibodies. Two types of binding affinities are incorporated into the model as coefficients in the differential equations. Our knowledge-based index of binding affinities, or association constants (Watabe et al. 2007), enables us to estimate changes in the values of the coefficients due to mutation. Assuming that epidemic factors are unchanged, fitness is measured as the size of the mutant population within a host relative to the size of the wild-type population. Adopting a population genetic approach, we calculate the probability that a mutant is fixed in a viral population within and between hosts.",

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attach its spike (S) protein to the host cell (Li et al. 2003). The cross-species transmission of the virus was permitted by a few amino acid substitutions in the RBD of the S protein (Li W et al. 2005; Song et al. 2005). In order to prevent reemergence of SARS, potent therapeutics and vaccines are needed. The S protein is a major antigenic determinant and is therefore an attractive target for neutralizing antibodies. It has been suggested that passive immunization with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) might be used to treat SARS (Holmes 2003), and human mAbs with a potent neutralizing effect against the RBD of the S protein have been identified (Sui et al. 2004; Prabakaran et al. 2006). Using our knowledge-based model of viral population dynamics and population genetics, we predict amino acid mutations that are most likely to fix in the viral population.",

We simulate the emergence of mutants by changing the amino acid sequence of the RBD of the S protein. The amino acid substitutions in the RBD affect the association constants of the protein complexes, and hence, the parameters of the mathematical model that characterize the virus change. We determine the amino acid mutation rate by structural constraints on the mutations. In the simulation, the rate is incorporated by generating mutations according to the amino acid preferences in the local structural environment, and the association constants are evaluated by a knowledge-based sequence\u2013structure fitness measure (Watabe et al. 2007).",

In the work of Nowak and Bangham (1996), the variable W represents B cells, and its production rate is set to rVW.

The virion half-life has been estimated for several viruses. In an analysis of viral dynamics during antiviral therapy, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been estimated to have an average half-life of 2.7 h (Neumann et al. 1998). For the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the estimated virion half-life is about 1 day (Nowak et al. 1996). The half-life of the human immunodeficiency virus has been estimated to be 5.8 h (Perelson et al. 1996). The estimated half-life of infected cells not only depends on the virus but also shows considerable interpatient variation. Half-lives of 1.7\u201370 days for HCV (Neumann et al. 1998) and 10\u2013100 days for HBV (Nowak et al. 1996) have been obtained.

The medical treatment may start within a few days of onset. Hence we should consider 5\u20138 days as a time period that the virus can infect to other hosts. Therefore, we set the range of integration as 0 to \u03c4. On the (\u03b2,q)-plane, a viral fitness landscape is given based on changes in w. Viruses with higher values of w can infect new hosts more efficiently. On the other hand, the final results of our analysis do not depend much on the value of \u03c4 (data not shown). The aspect of the fitness landscape is characterized by the truncation of the integration itself rather than the time point of the truncation. Hence, we set the value of \u03c4 equal to 10 days.",

The virus starts from a point on the fitness landscape and moves through the landscape based on changes of binding affinities resulting from particular mutations in the amino acid sequence of the RBD. The parameters of the mathematical model, (\u03b2,q), represent the strengths of couplings between virus particles and uninfected cells and between virus particles and antibodies. Those couplings are mediated by proteins: the S proteins, the ACE2 receptors, and the fragments of antigen-binding (Fabs) of antibody. Hence, we assume that the parameters of the mathematical model, (\u03b2,q), have the following relationships to the association constants of the protein complexes (Ka(S-ACE2)for the S protein\u2013ACE2 receptor complex and Ka(S-Fab) for the S protein\u2013Fab complex): \u03b2\u221dKa(S-ACE2) and q\u221dKa(S-Fab).

In order to carry out in silico calculations, information about the structure of the corresponding molecular complex is needed as a template. In the case of SARS-CoV, the structure of the complex formed between the RBD and the peptidase domain of human ACE2 has been determined (Li F et al. 2005), and X-ray crystallography data are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The structure of the S protein when bound by a neutralizing antibody has also been described (Hwang et al. 2006; Prabakaran et al. 2006). In order to estimate the binding free energy of the protein complex, the protein\u2013protein interactions must be investigated. Several computational methods have been proposed (Elcock et al. 2001). Molecular dynamics simulations have increasingly been used to study protein\u2013protein interactions. However, because of long convergence time, molecular dynamics simulations are prohibitive for large systems such as protein complexes (Cui et al. 2008). In this study, we employ a knowledge-based sequence\u2013structure fitness measure (Watabe et al. 2007) to evaluate the binding affinities between the S protein of SARS-CoV and the Fabs of mAbs and also those between the S protein and its receptor. The sequence\u2013structure fitness measure is a likelihood-based index, which quantifies a degree to which a sequence fits in a given structure. The measure is calculated empirically based on amino acid preferences and pairwise interactions in structural environments present in template structures. By bypassing structural prediction, it is possible to analyze thousands of sequences and correlate high-fitness sequences with structural changes along evolutionary pathways.",

The degree of residue burial characterizes the local environment of a residue, which is defined as the number of C\u03b1 atoms surrounding the C\u03b1 atom of the corresponding residue within a distance of 1 nm (10 \u00c5) (Watabe et al. 2007). The spatial distances between the C\u03b1 atoms of each amino acid pair are categorized into intervals of 0.1 nm from 0.7 to 1 nm. Pairs with spatial distances of \u22640.7 nm are compiled into one category because such small distances are rare (Watabe et al. 2007). The interaction between a residue and its neighborhood in the primary sequence plays a major role in making local structural conformations, such as an \u03b1-helix. Hence, we treat interactions between residues with small site intervals j \u2212 i \u2264 4 separately from those with larger site intervals (Watabe et al. 2006).

Hence, the appearance of the mutants that may be fixed with high probability within the host population is not a grandiose figment but in reality it can happen. The time span of the occurrence of the mutants fixed within the host population can be measured by setting an explicit value of the rate \u03b1i at which mutations occur at the corresponding residue.
