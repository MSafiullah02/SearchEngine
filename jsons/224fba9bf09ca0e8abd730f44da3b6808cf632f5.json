Notable exceptions include a stronger association between RSV and bronchiolitis in young infants, PIV and laryngotracheobronchitis, and HRVs and reactive airway disease exacerbations. In immunocompromised patients, respiratory viral infections can be associated with prolonged shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. Prolonged viral shedding can be associated with persistent respiratory symptoms or can be asymptomatic with durations up to 4 weeks (mean). 5 Persistent shedding of PIV in asymptomatic immunocompromised patients for many months has been noted using sensitive molecular detection methods, 6 and prolonged shedding has been described for HMPV, HCoVs, and HRVs. [7] [8] [9] Impairment of T-cell function appears to be commonly associated in children with prolonged shedding; additional risk factors in HCT recipients include initial high viral load, use of steroids, and myeloablative conditioning. 9 Initial clinical symptoms related to RSV infection in immunocompromised hosts are similar to those in immunocompetent persons.",

Over 1 to 2 weeks, lower respiratory tract involvement may become evident by increasing respiratory distress, worsening hypoxia, and potentially, the need for assisted ventilation. Children or adults who acquire RSV or HMPV during or shortly after chemotherapy for malignancy may also have severe, life-threatening disease. 10 Recovery after assisted ventilation for RSV and HMPV pneumonia occurs but remains uncommon despite advances in supportive care. The associated respiratory failure in severely immunocompromised patients may result in multiorgan system failure, with high mortality rates in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 11, 12 Severe and fatal infection attributed to HMPV has been reported in cancer patients, and HMPV is a relatively common cause of acute respiratory infection in children and adults with malignancy, HCT recipients or organ transplant recipients. 13 Risk factors for severe HMPV infection include lymphopenia. 7,10,13 Quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) viral load has not been associated with mechanical ventilation or death for RSV, PIV, or HMPV in adult patients after HCT; however, the detection of respiratory virus RNA in serum has been associated with fatal outcomes. 11 PIV infection with lower respiratory tract disease in immunosuppressed patients, particularly those in the immediate posttransplantation period, may result in a similar clinical picture, although the overall mortality rate may be less than that associated with RSV. 14,15 Many immunocompromised adults with PIV infection first present with symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract disease, but in contrast to RSV, influenza, and HMPV, detection of PIV-1 and PIV-3 in asymptomatic HCT recipients is relatively common, reported in 6 of 17 (35%) infection episodes in a prospective study. 6 Fewer than half of PIV-infected patients have a fever. In severely immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients less than 100 days after transplant, PIV-3 is the most common PIV subtype detected, reported in 80% of 544 HCT recipients with PIV. 16 In all PIV-infected transplant recipients, infection may progress to lower respiratory tract disease with more serious disease linked to supplemental oxygen requirement, low monocyte counts, and high-dose steroid use. The detection of PIV in BAL or other lower respiratory tract specimens is associated with decreased survival overall in HCT recipients. 16 Higher pretransplant PIV-3 antibody levels were not protective against severe sequelae. 15 Concomitant infections with other viruses, fungi, or severe graft-versus-host disease are relatively common in adult patients with PIV pneumonitis.",

Quadrivalent vaccine should be offered when available. Studies are ongoing to assess the immunogenicity and safety of high-dose influenza vaccination in immunocompromised adults and children. Influenza vaccination is recommended for all family members, close contacts, and health care workers caring for immunocompromised patients.

Ribavirin, a synthetic guanosine nucleoside, has been licensed for the treatment of RSV respiratory disease in children since 1986 and for the treatment of RSV disease in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation since 1993. Ribavirin is the only approved drug for lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, but concerns regarding efficacy, difficulties in administration, and the extremely high cost of the drug have resulted in minimal current use of the drug. 31 Ribavirin is available in aerosolized, oral, and IV forms. Several retrospective studies, including a pooled analysis, have shown aerosolized or oral ribavirin is protective against disease progression to lower respiratory tract infection and mortality in HCT recipients; however, conclusive evidence of efficacy from randomized trials is not available. 32 In patients with leukemia, multivariate models demonstrated similar effects. 33 Oral ribavirin has been retrospectively evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy or in HCT recipients, suggesting a possible effect of oral ribavirin; however, lack of randomized controls has been a limitation in all studies. 34 In adult HCT and hematologic malignancy patients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, use of aerosolized ribavirin was associated with decreased mortality. Oral or IV ribavirin although not statistically significant as the effect was smaller. 11, 12 Of note, some data suggest pediatric HCT recipients with RSV have little morbidity and mortality even without ribavirin therapy. 35 Current international guidelines recommend aerosolized or systemic (oral or IV) ribavirin with intravenous immunoglogulin (IVIG) in patients with RSV upper respiratory tract infection undergoing allogeneic HCT, allogeneic HCT recipients with risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract infection, and allogeneic HCT patients with lower respiratory tract infection. 36 Recommendations for ribavirin administration for HCT and SOT recipients, and oncology patients are outlined in Table 21 .1. Most data and guidance for use of ribavirin are in HCT and oncology; few studies have clearly demonstrated efficacy in SOT recipients, and most data are in lung transplant when both oral and IV ribavirin have been used, 37 For HCT and oncology patients, high-risk situations include patients with lymphopenia; additional risk factors, such as smoking history and use of high-dose total body irradiation, could be used to further risk-stratify patients. In general, aerosolized ribavirin is reserved for subjects with virologically confirmed (BAL positive for RSV) lower respiratory tract infection. It is administered by small-particle aerosol from a solution containing the drug at a concentration of 20 mg/mL sterile water via aerosol for 2 to 20 hours/day, or at a concentration of 60 mg/mL water over 2 hours 3 times daily. Aerosol administration results in high levels of ribavirin in the secretions, with levels exceeding 1000 mM and little systemic absorption. The potential environmental release of ribavirin has caused concern in hospital personnel because of the potential teratogenicity of ribavirin and thus exposure is contraindicated in pregnant women because of its teratogenic potential. Administration of ribavirin via a ventilator, using a high-dose, short-duration method of drug delivery or with a vacuum-exhausted treatment hood, results in minimal or no detectable ribavirin in the rooms of treated children.",

Triple-combination antiviral therapy with amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir has been proposed to treat immunocompromised patients with severe influenza A with resistance to oseltamivir. A randomized trial comparing triple-combination antiviral therapy with oseltamivir alone in high-risk adults demonstrated an effect on viral outcomes but no clinical benefit. 44 Parainfluenza. In a retrospective study of patients with leukemia or HCT recipients with PIV infection, ribavirin had no impact on viral shedding, symptom and hospitalization length, progression to lower respiratory tract infection, or mortality. 45 A systematic review evaluated aerosolized or systemic ribavirin in 10 retrospective studies in this same population and found no difference in PIV-associated mortality or in progression to lower respiratory tract infection. 46 Given lack of evidence of clinical efficacy, ribavirin is not recommended for PIV infections. The impact of IVIG alone remains to be determined, although IVIG administration for PIV lower respiratory tract infection did not reduce mortality. 16 Other Respiratory Viruses. The management of other respiratory viral infections in immunosuppressed patients is generally supportive (Table 21 .2). Ribavirin has shown efficacy against HMPV in vitro and in mouse models, with anecdotal reports describing its use in severe infection in immunocompromised hosts (with and without IVIG). Lack of controlled studies of ribavirin and the known toxicities of therapy, including hemolytic anemia, limit its recommendation for HMPV. Currently, no approved antiviral agents exist for treatment of HCoV, HRV, HBoV, or enteroviruses, although some investigational agents are upcoming. The use of IVIG has not been evaluated prospectively and is not routinely recommended for treatment of respiratory viral infections. Some centers routinely check and replete immunoglobulins, but the impact on respiratory virus acquisition and severity is not known.",

Nosocomial RSV and PIV infections in adults with leukemia and bone marrow transplants are associated with a high mortality rate. 5, 14 The transmission of identical strains of RSV from the outpatient setting into the hospital has been documented, demonstrating the importance of infection control measures. Nosocomial transmission of HMPV also occurs, with outbreaks in both inpatient and outpatient units. In one study, 15 patients were diagnosed with HMPV within 7 weeks in a tertiary care cancer unit. 7 Molecular subtyping revealed infection with genotype A2a virus, implicating nosocomial transmission. Four patients (26.6%) died of HMPV-associated pneumonia and consequent multiorgan failure. Nosocomial outbreaks characteristically occur from multiple introductions of community respiratory viral strains as well as patient-topatient spread (perhaps with health care providers as intermediaries). For prevention of nosocomial transmission, contact isolation precautions are effective, provided that compliance with the policy is maintained among personnel. Hospital personnel may play a role in the transmission of RSV and other respiratory viruses to susceptible patients. Viral spreading can be limited by adherence to strict handwashing procedures and cohorting of infected and exposed individuals. Use of gloves, masks, and goggles in the hospital setting also limits spread. Such strict measures are appropriate in high-risk settings such as pediatric intensive care units or bone marrow transplant wards. Restriction of visitors, including young children, in hospital wards with patients at high risk for RSV infection may be necessary during epidemic periods in the community. Continued compliance through the respiratory virus season by all members of the health care team is critical.",

The impact of other factors such as viral-specific risk scores, location of infection and viral load, need to be evaluated. In pediatric patients, diagnostic PCR should be considered on all transplant candidates, regardless of symptoms, and transplant delay should be considered, if feasible, with ongoing symptoms or evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.",

In most healthy children, respiratory viruses are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and are not accompanied by significant morbidity. In immunocompromised hosts, including hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and oncology patients, respiratory viruses can be associated with significant clinical manifestations, including prolonged viral shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. This chapter reviews the major respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Other viruses can manifest as pulmonary infection; however, these viruses are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 17 for discussion of cytomegalovirus and Chapter 22 for discussion of adenoviruses).",
