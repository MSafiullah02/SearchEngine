To prepare students for this environment, a newly developed, evidence-based e-learning module was designed and implemented in the undergraduate curriculum. The aim of this study was to investigate whether e-learning is a feasible method in preparing PT students for clinical work in complex ICU environments, as perceived by students and experts. Methods: A mixed methods proof of concept study was undertaken. Participants were final-year students of an international curriculum, and experts from didactic and clinical fields. An e-learning module consisting of 7 separate chapters based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical expertise was developed, piloted and incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum as a compulsory course to be completed prior to clinical ICU rotations. Data were collected through 3 focus group meetings and 5 semi-structured interviews; these meetings and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed.",

Thematic analysis revealed three themes: expected competencies of PT students in ICU, feeling prepared for ICU clinical work and dealing with local variety. The elearning module enabled students to anticipate clinical situations and PT tasks in the ICU. Higher level clinical reasoning skills, handling of lines and wires and dealing with out-of-textbook situations could not be achieved with the e-learning module alone. Conclusions: An e-learning module can sufficiently prepare PT students for their clinical tasks in the ICU, as long as it is integrated with, or closely connected to, the students' clinical placement.",

Teaching methods currently applied in preparation for the ICU include theoretical classes, classroom and in-hospital simulations with computerized manikins and compulsory clinical rotations [19] [20] [21] [22] . Despite having had preparational classes or simulation scenarios, PT students are often overwhelmed by the ICU environment and lack confidence in the execution of clinical tasks involving (sedated) patients dependent on mechanical ventilation [23, 24] . E-learning modules use a variety of interactive teaching methods, such as real-life videos, which can be helpful in transferring knowledge and reasoning skills and preparing students for complex environments. It has been shown to be an effective and flexible teaching tool in undergraduate medical and allied health education [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . With internet-based courses being accessible anywhere in the world and on any electronic device [30, 31] , an e-learning module on ICU-PT could be a convenient teaching method for an internationally oriented curriculum. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop, implement and evaluate an e-learning module on evidence-based physiotherapy in the ICU and to investigate its feasibility with regards to preparing undergraduate PT students for clinical work in ICUs worldwide.",

Undergraduate students in the ESP program are required to conduct 4 clinical rotations, each lasting 10 weeks. The last two clinical rotations are commonly Fig. 1 Phases of study: design and evaluation conducted within rehabilitation facilities, a hospital stroke unit and/or an ICU. As these rotations can take place anywhere in the world, students are provided with internationally oriented course content.

Participants felt less prepared for dealing with emergency situations, handling patients' lines and attachments, adapting to the variety in clinical expectations across international ICU settings and utilizing higher-level clinical reasoning skills, such as designing tailor-made interventions based on a patient's clinical presentation. Results from this study align with existing evidence suggesting that supervised practice in clinical settings is required to increase students' confidence and improve clinical reasoning skills [19, 22, 33, 34] . Integration of this e-learning module with clinical practice provides a foundation for the highly demanding clinical responsibilities in ICU. Timing in which the educational tool is offered in relation to the clinical experience is essential [18, 25] . If, additional to this e-learning module, more complex and clinical reasoning-provoking material would be completed during the clinical rotation, learning on the two highest levels of Miller's pyramid of clinical competence -the 'shows how' and the 'does' -could likely be facilitated [35] .",

            "text": "This study also showed the variety of clinical practice requirements in ICU settings worldwide which provides a challenge for undergraduate curricula in the context of (international) mobility of health professionals [36] . Recent studies highlight these differences; ICU-PTs working in Australia or some European countries are expected to adjust ventilator settings, perform (endo) tracheal suctioning and interpret imaging findings, whereas South African ICU-PTs must also show cultural sensitivity and be a team player [13, 15, 16] . To accommodate for this international variety in clinical practice, e-learning modules prove to be efficient teaching tools, as the content is easily adaptable and additional, elective chapters could be added [25, 28] . For faculties, where research, education and clinical practice are tightly linked, e-learning modules can serve as excellent tools to incorporate the results of ongoing communication between these departments, hence providing students with authentic content in preparation for clinical practice.",

However, the course did not fully succeed in removing student anxiety when handling complex patient cases; this objective is difficult to achieve with e-learning only.

With regards to theoretical knowledge, participants mentioned the understanding of physiological processes, interpretation of patient data and understanding of the ICU environment and equipment were the most important:\"So, I think the main thing that would be good [is] if students had a good grip on [..] physiology and the theoretical...[..] [because] it is a pain to teach them the theoretical underpinnings [in] here.\" (Amy, Irish clinical expert) \"I expect them [..] to have a good knowledge of the assessment [..] so looking at all systems so they can adequately clinically reason what they need to do [..]\" (Wendy, South African clinical expert) \"He must have knowledge of the environment [..] and the difference between the ICU and the wards ..uhm.. mechanical ventilation.\" (Alexandra, Greek clinical expert) With regards to clinical performance, participants agreed that (understanding of) cardiopulmonary assessment and interventions were required competencies. \"[my clinical site] heavily focuses also on respiratory management [..] So they were like 'oh, you don't know how to do auscultation as an assessment?' [..] so there's like a whole system of respiratory physio that I had no idea about \u2026 [Have] Auscultated maybe once in school...\" (Student: Grace)",

So, if, alarms are going off, looking at the equipment rather than looking at the patient [..] They are very awkward handling the equipment, now they do improve, it's a learning curve.\" (Amy, Irish clinical expert)In the clinical environment, students discovered the reality of the theoretical content covered in the course:\"First thing I noticed was how common delirium is [..] I was reading about it in the course but I'm like okay, that's a weird thing that might happen, but no [..] it was a daily thing.\" (Student: Sarah) \"When I actually got there and I saw the machines I was like, oh, this is this [..] but then the physios were like okay can you now unhook this person and I was like [..] No! You know, the module did not really prepare you for the handling of the wires.\" (Student: Leah)Overall, students perceived the e-learning module's general content on the ICU environment to be helpful in preparation for their clinical rotation. It decreased anxiety:\"Yes, I felt less scared, I guess. At the beginning I was like I have no idea [..] all those tubes and things and you have no idea how the patients are like, but I feel less scared doing it now [after course completion].\" (Student: Diane)",

[..] they all knew, all physios knew what it meant [..] that's how they scored [..] and then wrote SOAP notes as well, so you could see how the patient was progressing by these numbers.\" (Student: Ella) \"and I know that [in the Netherlands they] like the DEMMI, but [..] I'm not sure if it would be worth looking at, or if that's standard practice in sort of other ICUs [..] so if you're working elsewhere [..] the CPAx is quite a nice tool [..] holistic also.\" (Wendy, South African clinical expert)",
