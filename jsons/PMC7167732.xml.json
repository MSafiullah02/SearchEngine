By the end of April 2014, PEDV outbreaks had been reported in 27 states of the United States, with 2692 confirmed cases (http://www.aasv.org/news/story.php?id = 6989), resulting in significant economic and public health concerns.",

Several quantitative proteomics approaches have been used to provide specific insights into the gene expression profiles of coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) 14, infectious bronchitis coronavirus 15, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus 16. Generally, in host cells coronavirus infection gives rise to alterations in transcriptional patterns, the cell cycle, the cytoskeleton, apoptosis pathways, the immune system, stress responses, and likely also causes inflammation 17.

Apoptosis triggered by virus infection directly leads to viral pathogenesis; however, blocking apoptosis can avoid premature death of the infected cells, permitting a high titer of virus replication or a persistent infection 17. In our analysis, two apoptosis\u2010related genes, (14\u20103\u20103 and caspase\u20108) were identified following PEDV infection. The 14\u20103\u20103 proteins constitute a family of conserved adaptor and scaffold proteins present in all eukaryotic organisms. Previous reports showed that 14\u20103\u20103 proteins modulate the cell cycle and apoptosis at multiple steps, leading to an inhibition of the onset of apoptosis 23, 24. Our results demonstrate that decreased expression of four 14\u20103\u20103 proteins (eta, theta, beta/alpha, gamma) was concomitant with PEDV infection, and thus predicted to promote apoptosis of infected cells. Caspase\u20108 is the initiator caspase that is activated by the correlation between external apoptotic elements and cell surface molecules, playing fundamental roles in initiating the apoptotic cascade response 25. The downregulation of caspase\u20108 expression in PEDV\u2010infected cells suggests a mechanism that attenuates virus\u2010induced apoptosis at the early infection phase, thus favoring a virus to replicate to a higher titer. In the case of SARS\u2010CoV, stimulation of both apoptotic and antiapoptotic elements has been seen, allowing for rapid multiplication of progeny virus before cell lysis 26. The interplay between apoptosis\u2010related genes in PEDV infection might contribute to it achieving maximum viral replication before cell death.",

            "text": "Viruses are known to develop the ability to manipulate a variety of host cellular signal transduction pathways to facilitate virus survival. Among these pathways is the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) pathway, comprising Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. These play central roles in the modulation of cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation 27. Many viruses activate the ERK pathway for higher levels of cellular and viral gene production. By activating ERK1/2, enterovirus 71 prevents activation of the proapoptotic molecules caspase\u20109 and Bcl\u20102 associated death promoter 28. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection activates ERK1/2 at the early infection phase in PAM cells, with ERK activation essential for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replication in vitro 29. Some studies have shown a negative correlation between ERK activity and viral replication. The Ebola virus glycoprotein GP specifically inhibits ERK1/2 to cause increased cell toxicity and viral titers 30. Yoshizuka et al. reported that overexpression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV\u20101) Vpr protein downregulated gene expression and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the ERK/MAPK pathway. It was speculated that the decrease in ERK1/2 activation is important for HIV replication and pathogenesis 31. SARS\u2010CoV N induces apoptosis of COS\u20101 monkey kidney cells in the absence of growth factors through downregulation of the ERK pathway 32. ERK1/2 regulation of viral replication functions occurs at specific points during the replication cycle 33. The manipulation of the ERK pathway is a ubiquitous characteristic during viral infection and is not limited to specific viruses or viral events 34. In our study, ERK1 was significantly downregulated during PEDV infection. The specific mechanism by which PEDV manipulates the ERK pathway for maximal viral replication is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",

It has been implicated that HSP27 is upregulated during enterovirus 71, feline herpesvirus, and infectious bursal disease virus infections 38, 39, 40. Based on our results, HSP27 was downregulated during PEDV infection, similar to previous reports regarding adenoviruses 41, classical swine fever virus 42, and porcine circovirus type 2 21. HSP27 is an intracellular antiviral factor against hepatitis B virus through the induction of type I interferon and downstream antiviral effectors 43 and inhibits caspase\u2010independent apoptosis.
