Pitfalls associated with this technique include limits to the number of targeted pathogens, the requirement for continuous monitoring to ensure sensitivity/specificity is maintained and the need to evolve to include emerging pathogens. Introducing target independent next generation sequencing (NGS) could resolve these issues and revolutionise respiratory viral diagnostics. Objectives: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of target independent NGS against the current standard diagnostic test. Study design: Diagnostic RT-PCR of clinical samples was carried out in parallel with target independent NGS. NGS sequences were analyzed to determine the proportion with viral origin and consensus sequences were used to establish viral genotypes and serotypes where applicable. Results: 89 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. A viral pathogen was detected in 43% of samples by NGS and 54% by RT-PCR. All NGS viral detections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Conclusions: Target independent NGS can detect viral pathogens in clinical samples. Where viruses were detected by RT-PCR alone the Ct value was higher than those detected by both assays, suggesting an NGS detection cut-off -Ct = 32. The sensitivity and specificity of NGS compared with RT-PCR was 78% and 80% respectively. This is lower than current diagnostic assays but NGS provided full genome sequences in some cases, allowing determination of viral subtype and serotype.

Assays can be developed quickly to detect novel/emerging pathogens and can be combined to identify multiple microbiological pathogens in a single test. Yet there is a limit to the number of targets, usually up to four, which can be included in an in-house test before compromising test sensitivity. As a result, diagnostic laboratories must develop a panel of multiplex tests in order to detect the whole range of pathogens. Also, as for all PCR based assays, detection is based on targeting conserved regions of the pathogen genome and mutations can lead to reduced sensitivity or false negative results. Furthermore, only the targeted pathogens included in the assay will be identified, therefore atypical or emerging pathogens will generally evade detection by PCR. Although commercial PCR based tests [1] are available that overcome some of the pitfalls associated with in-house tests, they remain PCR based technologies and as a result suffer from the same sequence based pitfalls outlined above. Introducing NGS into a diagnostic setting may revolutionize the investigation of respiratory infections. Combining sequence independent amplification with NGS will potentially detect viral and non-viral pathogens within a clinical specimen without actively targeting them, while simultaneously analyzing the genetic sequence. NGS is established in virus discovery, whole genome studies and metagenome studies [2] [3] [4] thus the simultaneous detection of multiple different pathogens with this technique is possible.
