Since you cared for me in the ICU, I have been out of the hospital and trying to get on with my life for the past 2 years. Primarily, how long my memory will be effected? I am having daily problems with many different things. I have trouble with people\u2019s names that I have worked with for years. I can\u2019t remember where I put things at home. I can\u2019t help my children with their homework because I don\u2019t remember how to do simple multiplication problems. It is so embarrassing that I cant balance my check book and keep having these bounced checks. Goodness, I am a college graduate! This is really effecting my day to day life. Is there any way I can find out to what extint this will effect my memory and for how long? I just want to know what to expect and is there any way for me to improve my situation? Please contact me with any information regarding my condition.",

While research is limited regarding cognitive outcomes in patients who survive critical illness, these patients are at risk for physical, emotional, and neurocognitive morbidity [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Although additional research is necessary to address crucial questions regarding cognitive impairment in ICU survivors, early reports are worrying, and in some respects parallel early reports of cognitive impairment following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Two decades ago studies on CABG and cognitive outcome were in their infancy and received relatively little attention [7]. Since that time over 50 investigations [8] have studied the effects of CABG on cognition and have documented the existence of pervasive and frequently severe cognitive deficits in 20\u201380% of patients following surgery [9]. The cognitive impairment reported in ICU survivors is similar to that observed following elective CABG surgery [10] and following carbon monoxide poisoning [11].",

Among specific populations of ICU survivors such as patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) the prevalence of persistent cognitive impairment is even greater and may be as high as 78% at 1 year [12] and 25% at 6 years [13] (Table 1). While cross-study comparisons are difficult due to differences in study design (e.g., prospective vs. retrospective), definition of sequelae, neurocognitive tests administered, time to follow-up, patient population, and disease severity, the potential ramifications of these findings are significant, particularly if cognitive impairment goes unidentified. The purpose of this report is to highlight the problem of cognitive impairment following ICU survival, to assist clinicians in identifying probable cognitive impairment in ICU patients through objective as well as clinically oriented strategies, and to provide guidelines for referral of cognitively impaired patients to specialists in cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation.

The term cognitive impairment, as defined here, refers to clinically significant abnormalities in one or more brain functions including memory, attention, mental processing speed, executive function, visual spatial abilities, and intellectual function. Cognitive impairment can be mild, moderate, or severe and can limit an individual\u2019s ability to think, reason, and/or perform everyday tasks. The term cognitive decline refers to deterioration in cognitive abilities from baseline and is not necessarily synonymous with cognitive impairment as it does not imply an absolute level of functioning. For example, a person with an intelligence quotient in the superior range might experience significant cognitive decline and still function within the normal range, therefore not being characterized as cognitively impaired. However, this type of decline can cause significant disruption in the everyday life of a person who is used to performing at high levels in occupational and vocational areas. Such was the case of the person quoted in the opening paragraph. Alternatively, slight decline in a person with below average intelligence could result in the diagnosis of cognitive impairment but have a minor impact on everyday function.",

In contrast to common dementias, there is only limited information regarding the clinical course of ICU-related cognitive impairment. For example, cognitive functioning appears to improve in many ICU survivors from hospital discharge to 1 year; however, significant numbers (46%) of ICU survivors remain impaired at 1 year [12], with little improvement during the 2nd [16].",

            "text": "The cognitive impairment experienced by many ICU survivors varies widely with regard to severity and should be thought of as acquired disease or an exacerbation of a preexisting disease (depending upon the individual patient\u2019s situation). Acquired cognitive impairment can range from mild to severe. For example, Jackson et al. [6] reported that after excluding those with detectable pre-ICU baseline cognitive impairment 34% of patients suffered from persistent cognitive impairment of a severity similar to the cognitive impairments observed in mild to moderate dementia. Although the nature of deficits differs across studies, it appears that impairment is particularly pervasive in areas of memory, visuoconstruction, processing speed, and executive functioning (Fig. 1). The cause and risk factors for the development of cognitive impairment following ICU hospitalization are largely unknown, although the risk factors for cognitive impairment following cardiac surgery are well documented and include advanced age, lower premorbid intelligence, cerebrovascular and peripheral-vascular disease, and hypoxia [17, 18]. Researchers have hypothesized that the presence of certain factors such as sepsis and ARDS and its associated hypoxemia [12], the development of delirium [19], and the use of sedative and narcotic medications are associated with the development of cognitive impairment after critical illness, although such mechanisms are in need of further exploration.",

Cognitive impairment resulting from a host of illnesses and medical syndromes including human immunodeficiency virus, ARDS, traumatic brain injury, and bacterial meningitis are associated with decreased quality of life [13, 24, 25, 26]. Even mild forms of cognitive impairment can be extremely problematic and may lead to significant difficulties in activities of daily living such as impaired driving, money management, and performance of basic household functions (e.g., cleaning, cooking, organizing) [27, 28, 29].",

For example, a 3-point decrease on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is associated with a $6,000 per year increase in overall healthcare expenditures [31]. The \u201cper-patient societal cost burden\u201d of even mild forms of cognitive impairment is estimated to be over $15,000 per year [32].

Reasons for limited recognition of cognitive impairment include time constraints, perception of limited treatment options, and limited knowledge regarding how to perform cognitive screening [40]. Intensivists and those caring for patients after the ICU stay should be aware that there are excellent brief screening tools that can be readily used in the midst of a busy day by themselves or other members of the ICU team (Table 2).

Although it is unlikely that they have the time to assess these patients individually, evaluations can be performed by nurses and other allied healthcare professionals such as psychologists, social workers, and speech therapists [41, 42]. However, due to multiple factors in ICU settings such as mechanical ventilation, related communication difficulties, the high prevalence of delirium, and patient fatigue, formal in-depth assessment of critically ill patients is often not possible. Sometimes the only assessment possible in such populations is related to detection of delirium, which can be rapidly and reliably assessed with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist [43, 44] or the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) [45, 46]. For free downloads of material used to monitor delirium in the ICU (including translations into multiple languages) the reader is referred to the educational website: http://www.icudelirium.org. If patients are not delirious, their cognitive function can be quickly evaluated using the MMSE or another brief cognitive screening tool. The detection of delirium may be important in light of evidence suggesting an association between delirium and an increased risk of cognitive impairment and other adverse outcomes (although much remains to be discovered about this association) [19].",

At this point neuropsychological assessment may be appropriate and the completion of such testing more realistic. In cases where cognitive screening is possible numerous suitable instruments are available [47]. The MMSE is widely considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d among screening tools and consists of 17 items (30 possible points) that assess a range of global abilities including orientation, memory, and attention [48]. A score of 23 or below on the MMSE indicates the presence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment, but it should be noted that the test is susceptible to the effects of age and education and can be more reliably scored using age and education adjusted norms [49]. Other screening tools that are equally \u201cuser friendly\u201d and, in some cases require even less time to administer are available (Table 2). In general, cognitive screening instruments require little if any specialized training to administer and score, and depending on the instrument the administration time varies from 1 to 10 min. While the sensitivity and specificity of these instruments vary, they generally have acceptable reliability and validity and are effective at identifying moderate to severe cognitive impairment. They are less sensitive in the detection of mild forms of cognitive impairment [47]. While more comprehensive and sophisticated instruments exist, using them with hospitalized patients may be impractical as they can be quite lengthy and may require specialized training to administer.",

By then patients have recovered from any transient cognitive dysfunction (e.g., delirium, effects of medications) and may be functioning at levels that reflect their new baseline. Generally, individuals have begun to resume their normal activities and may experience previously nonexistent functional limitations due to acquired cognitive impairment. It may be beneficial to repeat the MMSE and compare the current score with those obtained during the patient\u2019s hospitalization. Improvement in cognitive function is expected and a decline of more than 3 points (or a score below the standard cutoff of 23), as well as the presence of persistently abnormal scores, suggests the need for further evaluation, as the MMSE is a relatively stable, reliable measure and resistant to large fluctuations in scoring in the absence of actual neuropsychological change [53].",

Formal assessments of functional abilities can be carried out with instruments such as the Pfeffer et al. [55] Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) and the Lawton and Brody [56] Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Table 3) or by asking simple, targeted questions. For example, clinicians can inquire about a patient\u2019s ability to perform complex tasks such as using a telephone or a remote control, following a complex recipe, making a grocery list, or managing money or medications [57]. An important factor to evaluate is the presence of change and the degree to which the current level of function is different from prehospital levels. Poor performance on measures of functional ability are not proof of cognitive impairment but can assist a practitioner in determining whether a patient should be referred for a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment [58].",

The prevalence and severity of affective disorders including symptoms of depression and anxiety in ICU survivors range from less than 10% to 58% [6, 12, 60, 61, 62]. Depression has been reported to occur in up to 30% of ICU survivors [6], and it is estimated that 47% have clinically significant anxiety [59]. Indeed, it may be that the high rates of depression among ICU survivors are related to the cognitive impairment they experience, although this has not been evaluated in ICU cohorts. Affective disorders such as depression as well as posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety may adversely affect test performance, especially if severe [63, 64]. Moderate to severe depression may result in decreased effort and low motivation that may decrease neuropsychological test scores in cognitive domains such as psychomotor speed or attention [65, 66], whereas moderate to severe anxiety may result in increased distractibility and blocked thoughts or words [67, 68]. In some cases severe depression may mimic symptoms of cognitive impairment, although important differences exist between these conditions. In general, individuals with depression retain the ability to learn and do not forget as rapidly, do not display significant decrements in language, are inconsistent with regard to orientation to time and date and are typically more self-aware than their cognitively impaired counterparts [69, 70, 71].",

Therefore this is not recommended. An alternative approach is to screen only those individuals with an increased likelihood of developing cognitive impairment, although, as discussed above, only limited research has assessed causal mechanisms and risk factors of cognitive impairment following critical illness. More general evidence from investigations of neuropsychological dysfunction following medical illness suggests that risk factors include advanced age, the presence of disease states with central nervous system involvement (ARDS, sepsis, bacterial meningitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and hypoxemia [12, 25, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84].",

When patients are thought to have cognitive impairment, they should be referred to a clinical neuropsychologist for consultation and further neuropsychological evaluation. Although few neuropsychologists are actively involved in the assessment and management of survivors of critical illness at the present time, they are the appropriate professionals to assess cognitive function in these patients. It should be noted that neuropsychologists might be unavailable in small hospitals or rural areas. Neuropsychologists are typically employed in neurology, rehabilitation medicine, or psychiatry departments in most moderately sized or large medical centers. In cases where neuropsychologists are unavailable, it is appropriate to refer patients to a clinical psychologist, as they are trained in performing basic cognitive evaluations.",

Although much remains unknown, it appears that a significant percentage of critically ill patients and survivors experience cognitive impairment affecting quality of life and overall daily functioning. Intensivists, particularly those that follow patients after ICU discharge, are uniquely positioned to initiate cognitive screening and subsequent referral of critically ill patients and survivors. Cognitive screening is simple, quick, and of great potential benefit, particularly in the early detection of cognitive impairment and should be widely incorporated in relevant clinical settings.",
