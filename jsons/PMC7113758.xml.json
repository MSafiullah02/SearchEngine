There is evidence that many of these viruses have been transmitted from bats to other hosts where they caused serious disease (Drexler et al., 2012, Changula et al., 2014, Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015). Over 200 different viruses from 27 families have been detected in bats [reviewed in (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015)] but most of these viruses have yet to be isolated and there is scant information regarding the biology of these viruses in bats.",

Currently a single bat cell line (Tb1-Lu, ATCC number CCL-88, derived from the lung of Tadarida brasiliensis) is available through the American Type Culture Collection. Research groups have established other bat cell lines, from fruit and insectivorous bats using established techniques such as using the SV40 T-antigen and expressing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), but these are not commercially available yet (Crameri et al., 2009, Jordan et al., 2012, Maruyama et al., 2014).",

For example, they display unique strategies for neutralizing the DNA-damaging by-products of oxidative metabolism produced as a result of increased metabolic activity (Shen et al., 2010). Zhang et al. hypothesize that bats have evolved and accumulated genetic changes as a result of their adaptation to flight. This is to limit collateral damage caused by by-products of an elevated metabolic rate (Zhang et al., 2013). These genetic changes may be important in the expansion and contraction of important gene families, including genes involved in the innate response pathway (Zhang et al., 2013).",

American Big brown bat) using the Myotis polyomavirus T antigen (MyPVTag). We characterized the capacity of MyPVTag to enhance DNA replication in Vero cells and found that it significantly increased their DNA content. We then transfected MyPVTag into primary bat kidney cells and sub-cloned several cell lines. We characterized the lineage of these clones and tested their expression of the interferon beta (IFN beta) gene in response to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) stimulation. We further tested three cloned kidney cell lines for their ability to support the replication of viruses from the families Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae and Rhabdoviridae. The parental cell line and clones were capable of expressing IFN beta and supported the replication of viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; family Rhabdoviridae, genus Vesiculovirus), herpes simplex virus (HSV; family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, genus Herpesvirus), PED-CoV and MERS-CoV. PED-CoV and MERS-CoV are viruses for which transmission from bats, either directly or via an intermediate reservoir, has resulted in high mortality in pigs (Lee, 2015) and humans (Coleman and Frieman, 2014), respectively. VSV and HSV are members of viral families that have previously been detected in bat species [reviewed in (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015)]. Although E. fuscus primary embryonic cells have been described before (Qian et al., 2013), to our knowledge, this is the first cell line established from a northern latitude insectivorous bat that was transformed by using a viral element (MyPVTag) selected from a known bat virus. Furthermore, the established kidney cell lines were able to support the replication of selected viruses from three different virus families.",

For VSV inoculations, WST50 concentration of the virus was used to infect the cells, which were seeded in 12 well plates at a concentration of 2 \u00ed 105\n cells/well. WST50 was determined as that dilution of virus that produced 50% cell death as measured using the WST-1 assay. WST-1 assay is similar to the MTT assay (Heldt et al., 2006). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 1 \u00ed 104/well and analyzed with the WST assay at the indicated time points. 10 \u03b1/4l WST-1 reagent (Roche, USA) was added to each well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Colour developed was measured at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm using Molecular Devices Vmax spectrophotometer. Intensity of the colour developed is directly proportional to the number of viable cells in the wells. Cells cultured in 12-well plates were inoculated with 100 \u03b1/4l virus (VSV) for 1hr, rinsed with sterile PBS and medium replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells and the supernatant were harvested at 4 and 48 h post infection and frozen at \u222780 \u00b0C. After freeze-thawing the supernatant and cells three times, virus from Efk3 parental cell line and the subclones was titrated in Vero cells using the WST50 assay. Virus was quantified using the WST50 assay and formula as described by Heldt et al. (Heldt et al., 2006). For HSV titration, MRC5, Efk1B, Efk2F and Efk3 B subclones were seeded in triplicates at a concentration of 2.5 \u00ed 105\n cells/well in 6 well plates. The cells were inoculated with HSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Viral inoculum (0.5 ml) was replaced with complete medium and plates frozen at 0 and 24 h post inoculation. Plates were freeze-thawed 3x, transferred to 15 ml tubes and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatant was collected and serially diluted 1:10 down to 10\u22276 and titrated in Vero cells (1 \u00ed 105\n cells/well in 24-well plates). For quantifying the virus, 100ul of diluted virus was added to the wells and incubated for an hour. The inoculum was replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM + 1% pooled human serum (MP Biomedical Cellect).

SV40 T-ag is known to enhance DNA content in cells (Ohkubo et al., 1994, Ahuja et al., 2005) and interestingly the bat polyomavirus T-antigen shared similar properties. Myotis polyomavirus belongs to the same family as SV40. Large T-ags from both these viruses were transfected to immortalize the E. fuscus kidney cells, but only cells expressing MyPVTag gave rise to stable cell lines.

There is evidence, however, that tumor cells can co-express both epithelial and fibroblast markers (Viale et al., 1988). It is also possible that MyPVTag immortalized a mixture of both epithelial and fibroblast cells and the epithelial cells had a replication advantage during the process of limiting dilution cloning.

We were able to generate an insectivorous bat cell line capable of upregulating IFN beta gene expression in response to a known innate immune stimulus. An early interferon response is known to inhibit replication of some viruses (Katze et al., 2002). Interferon response in terms of interferon beta transcript upregulation by bat cell lines, mostly cell lines from fruit bats, has been demonstrated before (Hagmaier et al., 2007, Crameri et al., 2009, Biesold et al., 2011, Virtue et al., 2011). We analyzed the capacity of the Efk clones to respond to poly(I:C) stimulation by monitoring interferon beta gene expression. This synthetic analogue of dsRNA is usually used as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to stimulate interferon responses (Crameri et al., 2009). The clones responded to poly(I:C), as we observed a several thousand-fold increase in interferon beta transcript when compared to mock treated cells. Immortalization of cells is sometimes known to compromise the ability of the cells to transcribe the interferon beta gene (Biesold et al., 2011). The Efk clones, however, retained a remarkable but variable capacity to respond to poly(I:C).",
