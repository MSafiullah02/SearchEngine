This follow-up Review focuses on the main public health issues arising from planned religious, sporting, scouting, cultural, and musical mass gathering events held between 2013 and 2018: the Kumbh Mela 2013 and 2016 pilgrimages in India, the 12th Festival of Pacific Arts, the UN's Third Conference on Small Island Developing States, and the Micronesian Games in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup, the 23rd World Scout Jamboree in Japan in 2015, and the annual Hajj pilgrimages of 2015, 2016, and 2017 in Saudi Arabia. We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases, emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents arising from stampedes and terrorist attacks, and non-communicable diseases, including heat-related disorders. Priorities for further investments and opportunities for research into prevention, surveillance, and management of communicable and non-communicable diseases, thermal disorders, and mass casualty incidents are discussed.",

A rise in non-bloody diarrhoea cases was seen just 2 days after the main bathing day on Jan 29, 2013, and a peak in upper respiratory tract infections coincided with the peak in non-bloody diarrhoeal disease. The use by pilgrims of fires fuelled by cow dung or firewood resulted in more than 23% seeking cough medicine and smoke from choolahs using wood or coal was the commonest cause of respiratory illnesses among 15 000 patients.13 The observation that a so-called shaving ritual could increase the risk of bloodborne disease transmission has not yet been confirmed, because the practice is surrounded by secrecy and there is little of information on how widespread it is.13\n",

These cases were all associated with one scout unit. Two confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal disease were reported from Sweden.65 Molecular analysis65, 66, 67 showed that the same N meningitides isolates were responsible for the six cases and that they belonged to the ST-11 clonal complex, which is usually associated with large outbreaks. No other cases were reported from scouts who attended from other European countries or Japan. All participants were made aware of the outbreak and of signs and symptoms of invasive meningococcal disease through an information campaign and were offered ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis.66, 67 To make a decision on the need for prophylactic treatment for close contacts of returning scouts, throat or nasopharyngeal swabs from participants receiving antibiotic prophylaxis were taken. The carrier state in Swedish teenagers was studied comparing sensitivity of throat versus nasopharyngeal swabs from 1020 of the 1890 Swedish teenagers who participated in the Jamboree. The overall positivity for N meningitidis in this group was 83 (8%) of 1020, of which 61 were non-groupable.67 Further carriage studies are required during mass gatherings to determine the epidemiology and association between carrier isolates and disease-causing isolates in the population and the dynamics of globalisation from mass gathering events.",

The Indian Medical Mission studied 495 Indian pilgrims admitted for intensive care management during the 2016 Hajj and found that 262 (53%) had respiratory tract infections (53%) and 199 (24%) had traumatic injuries.68 Risk factors associated with high morbidity were old age and pre-existing comorbidities. A substantial number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj are elderly with pre-existing chronic medical conditions.10, 75, 95 These pilgrims might be unable to cope with the arduous rituals condensed into a 5-day period and thus exacerbation of existing non-communicable diseases occurs.95\n",

This initiative should aim to define the risk and threats to global health security and help reduce the risk of outbreaks and spread of zoonotic infections, such as Rift Valley fever, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers, across both humans and animals. This risk was illustrated dramatically by the Rift Valley fever outbreak in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, in 2000117 and the subsequent ban on East African livestock imports for several years.",

Although the formalisation of mass gatherings medicine has led to an increase in research studies into the specific health issues affecting pilgrims at the Hajj, they have not been forthcoming for the Kumbh Mela and other mass gatherings. Research output from mass gathering events is focused on small studies of pilgrims from individual countries and the data are not generalisable and no outputs have changed global policy. A need remains for more coordinated action by a global coalition of interested partners to share experiences from various mass gathering events, gather and translate appropriate evidence base into public health policy, and push for the best health promotion and educational policies. The creation of a mass gathering medicine specialist society or formal network, with a dedicated journal, might generate more frequent dialogue and enhance international collaborations on mass gathering medicine. A need also remains for high quality studies that are appropriately designed and adequately powered using participants from several geographical regions to provide data that stand up to rigorous scientific review. Advances in technology and closer monitoring of pilgrims at the Hajj provide an opportunity for large cohort studies of attendees of mass gathering events. These studies could focus on infectious diseases priorities, including neglected tropical diseases,119 non-communicable diseases, mental health, and heat-related disorders (Panel 4, Panel 5). The widespread availability of next-generation sequencing, genotyping and phenotyping, and other molecular methods also provides an opportunity for analyses of health risks among large population cohorts and for appropriate research to obtain an evidence base for the production of WHO-approved guidelines, which will be useful for countries that host mass gathering events.Panel 5Needs and opportunities for cross-continental multidisciplinary research and training\n\u2022Development of a stronger evidence base for public health planning and health services for mass gatherings\u2014 coordination and collation of experiences of the organisers and hosts of the recurrent annual mass gathering events on a range of communicable and non-communicable diseases can provide ideal platforms to take the formal discipline of mass gathering medicine forward, do appropriate research to obtain a strong evidence base, and update mass gathering-specific and individual guidelines\u2022High quality studies that are appropriately designed and adequately powered to provide data that stands up to rigorous scientific review and can move the public health and health promotion agendas forward\u2022Determination of the causes of mass casualty incidences, including stampedes, crush injuries, and fires, streamlining crowd flow, management of crowd behaviour and pilgrim psychology, and implementation of measures for reducing risk\u2022Determination of the underlying factors of thermal disorders, pathophysiological studies, and determination of the effectiveness of measures for reducing risk\u2022Surveillance of diseases with epidemic potential, determination of prevalence, prevention of transmission, management of the disease and patients, prevention (vaccines, chemoprophylaxis, or infection control), and cohort follow-up studies\u2022Surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, determination of prevalence, prevention and monitoring of transmission, management of the disease and patients, monitoring of globalisation, and long-term cohort follow-up studies (before travel, during mass gathering event, and after mass gathering event).\u2022Defining the scale of the problem of non-communicable diseases and comorbidities and their effects on pilgrim health and reduction of the risk of increased morbidity, hospitalisation, and mortality.\u2022Advances in molecular methods, genotyping, and phenotyping for analysis of health risks and underlying genetic and other risk factors using large pilgrim cohorts\u2022Real-time interoperable surveillance and reporting systems for active surveillance of communicable and non-communicable diseases during mass gatherings\u2022Big data collection, repository, sharing, and analyses\u2022Creation of a mass gathering medicine specialist society or proactive global network to enable frequent dialogue and enhance international multidisciplinary surveillance, research, and training collaborations\n",
