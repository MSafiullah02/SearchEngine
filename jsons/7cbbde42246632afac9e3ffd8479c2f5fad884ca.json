Fourteen HPeV genotypes have been described worldwide [Ito et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2005; Benschop et al., 2006a Benschop et al., , 2008 Al-Sunaidi et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007; Drexler et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Calvert et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010] . Clinical manifestations of HPeV infection including gastrointestinal, respiratory, and neurologic syndrome. HPeV1 and 2 have been associated with mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections [Abed and Boivin, 2006; Harvala et al., 2008; Harvala and Simmonds, 2009 ] and, in rare cases, with necrotizing enterocolitis [Birenbaum et al., 1997 ]. HPeV3 has been associated with sepsis-like illness, severe neurologic manifestations [Ito et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2005] , and infant death [Levorson et al., 2009; Sedmak et al., 2010] . Although HPeV genotypes 4-14 were identified in a number of different countries, their clinical role remains to be clarified [Benschop et al., 2006a Al-Sunaidi et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007; Drexler et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Calvert et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010] . On the other hand, HPeVs are not included usually in diagnostic panels, thus, the HPeV infection rate might be underestimated.",

In our series, five patients <1 month of age with sepsis-like illness were infected with HPeV3. In three of these patients, multiple samples (plasma, stool, CSF, or respiratory sample) were HPeV-positive. These findings support the hypothesis of a disseminated infection caused by HPeV3 [Pi\u0148 eiro et al., 2010; Sedmak et al., 2010] . The detection of HPeV in different biologic specimens from patients with sepsis-like illness may help to clarify the extent of the infection. On the other hand, none of patients with neurologic syndromes in the absence of sepsis-like illness was positive for HPeV, thus suggesting that HPeV neurotropism might be limited to specific clinical conditions. In keeping with other reports [Benschop et al., 2006b van der Sanden et al., 2008] , the majority of HPeV infections in our study were observed in the fall season.",
