The first clinical sign of sepsis, fever, is usually are not typical or specific. Similarly leukocytosis is nonspecific. The more typical signs or laboratory parameters such as arterial hypotension or lactate accumulation are often are late symptoms associated with organ dysfunction and a rising mortality rate. Traditional laboratory methods for confirming diagnosis of infectious diseases involve microbial identification that relies on morphological features, growth characteristics, and biochemical substrates. Microbiologists have searched for more rapid and efficient means of microbial identification. Nucleic acid amplification technology, PCR, has opened up new frontiers for microbial identification. Advent of molecular diagnostics has provided a tool for faster diagnosis of infections. Even PCR-based methods have time limitation as they cannot be performed within half an hour required for the POC diagnosis of infections. Non-PCR methods have been developed for this purpose and the role of biomarkers that can be detected more rapidly is being explored. The diagnosis of infections will, however, continue to require a critical clinical awareness, careful patient history, dedicated physical examination, and appropriate cultures.",

Some primarily indicate severity of inflammation (e.g. IL-6), others respond to infection, but do not indicate the host response well (endotoxin, lipoprotein binding protein, triggering receptor on myeloid cells). Recent data and cumulative analyses indicate that biomarkers of sepsis improve diagnosis of sepsis, but only a few biomarkers have impact on therapy and fulfill the clinical requirements. Characteristics of an ideal biomarker of infection are:High levels in sepsisPositive correlation with severity of infectionProlonged persistence in the bloodShould enable an early diagnosis by rapid and accurate bedside measurementShould indicate the course and prognosis of the diseaseShould facilitate therapeutic decisions\n",

Unfortunately, there is paucity of specific biomarkers of mitochondrial damage in vital organs. Carbomyl phosphate synthase (CPS)-1, a protein primarily localized to liver mitochondria, is present in high concentrations in the plasma of patients with sepsis. A prospective, randomized, controlled animal study has verified that circulating CPS-1 is a biomarker of mitochondrial damage and depletion in the liver during the subacute phase of sepsis (Crouser et al. 2006). From a mechanistic standpoint, mitochondrial depletion is not due to cell death but is apparently related to the removal of damaged mitochondria by lysosomes, followed by repletion of mitochondrial populations. Restoration of mitochondrial populations in the liver and reduced levels of CPS-1 appears to signal recovery from sepsis. CPS-1 may be superior to conventional biomarkers of liver damage during sepsis. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of CPS-1 as a biomarker of severity of sepsis.",

Chemokines act through a family of chemokine receptors, which are present on cell types such as leukocytes, dendritic cells and endothelial cells. Chemokines and their receptors play an important role in the innate immunity against infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.

It has been reevaluated now by a highly sensitive biological assay, which has been approved by the FDA for use in the US. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA\u2122 , Spectral Diagnostics Inc) is quite sensitive and is based on an ex-vivo whole blood measurement system. It measures the zymosan- and anti- endotoxin-antibody elicited respiratory burst in a kinetic luminometric assay. The antibody is directed against lipopolysaccharides of various gram-negative bacteria. Despite being a good biomarker for the exclusion of infection, it does not indicate well the host response. The indication for clinical use of this test thus is limited to the exclusion of infection in patients admitted to ICU. Because of the low response to severity of infection, it may have a limited value as guide to therapy. Also the low specificity may restrict clinical use.

After translation from CT-mRNA, ProCT is cleaved enzymatically into smaller peptides, finally to yield the 32 amino acid mature CT. Most CT precursor peptides, including ProCT, are found in the serum of normal persons. In microbial infections and in various forms of inflammation, circulating levels of several calcitonin precursors, including ProCT but not mature CT, increase up to several thousand-fold. This increase and especially the course correlate with the severity of the condition and with mortality.

During the onset of sepsis, a massive inflammatory reaction involving chemical mediators such as cytokines and chemokines and inflammatory cells such as the polymorphonuclear neutrophil and macrophage takes place. In addition to this systemic inflammatory process, sepsis and septic shocks cause a profound decrease in the peripheral vasomotor tone leading to a great decrease in the peripheral resistance. This event is central to derangement of hemodynamic and perfusion parameters. SIRS can be also precipitated by non-infective events such as trauma, pancreatitis, and surgery. As a consequence of an overactive SIRS response, the function of various organ systems may be compromised, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death. Efforts are being made to identify biomarkers for prognosis in SIRS. Sepsis causes an estimated 250,000 deaths annually in the US and 750,000 worldwide.

Skin testing does not distinguish latent infection from active tuberculosis. In addition, distinguishing M. tuberculosis from an atypical mycobacterium can prove difficult under the microscope. For reliable detection, a large number of organisms must be present. Sputum smears are positive in only one-half to three-quarters of cases. Culture to distinguish mycobacteria from atypical forms and to determine antibiotic sensitivity takes as long as 3\u20136 weeks. This distinction is important because atypical forms of mycobacteria do not respond to conventional antibiotics. This time lag in diagnosis, however, delays both the isolation of this contagious disease and the initiation of treatment.

Key finding from recent are that no one factor seems able to explain the complex course of M. tuberculosis infection.

Candidate biomarkers should differentiate people with active tuberculosis from healthy individuals, normalize with therapy, and reproducibly predict clinical outcomes in diverse patient populations (Wallis et al. 2009). Although a large number of promising candidate biomarkers have been examined to date, few patients in these studies have reached clinically meaningful outcomes, and few of the studies have been conducted to international research standards. The challenge now is to validate the suggested biomarkers being described and then reduce them to clinical practice (Doherty et al. 2009).

In addition to limited efficacy, treatment is often poorly tolerated because of side effects that prevent some patients from completing therapy. For these reasons, identification of a biomarker of response to treatment is a high priority. A genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, encoding IFN-lambda-3, has been reported to be associated with an approximately twofold change in response to treatment, both among patients of European ancestry and African-Americans (Ge et al. 2009). Almost 80% of those with the favorable response genotype eradicated the virus, while only about 30% with the less favorable response genotype did so. Because the genotype leading to better response is in substantially greater frequency in European\nthan African populations, this genetic polymorphism also explains approximately half of the difference in response rates between African-Americans and patients of European ancestry. On the other hand, among African Americans who did carry the CC genotype, treatment response was 53.3% \u2212 higher than the 33.3% treatment response observed among individuals of European descent who had the TT genotype. The favorable C allele also tended to be found less frequently in those with chronic HCV infections, suggesting a role in overall viral clearance. Unexpectedly though, the authors reported that the C alleles actually appeared to be linked to higher rather than lower baseline viral loads. More research is needed to determine whether the newly identified SNP is a biomarker for other important genetic changes or whether the change itself directly influences treatment outcomes.",
