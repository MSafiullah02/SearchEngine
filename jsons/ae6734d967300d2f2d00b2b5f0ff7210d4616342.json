This is in agreement with results by Boivin et al. [2002] , who reported that rhinoviruses were frequently associated with important respiratory and systemic symptoms in adults during the influenza season in a study that recruited patients from various regions of the world (Canada, Hong Kong, Germany, Switzerland, France, United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, The Netherlands, and Belgium).

Once thought to cause only common colds, rhinoviruses have been increasingly detected in association with lower respiratory infections [Miller et al., 2007] . In line with a role of rhinoviruses in more severe clinical ARI manifestations, fever occurred in 50.5% of the rhinovirus-related cases in the present study. The presence of coryza in 91.3% of rhinovirus positive cases indicates that this is probably a good predictor of the presence of rhinovirus infection in a patient with ILI (Table I) . One limitation of the present study was that the rhinovirus assay was performed only in samples that were negative for other viruses and this may have resulted in an underestimation of the true incidence of rhinovirus in this population.",

However, since antiviral therapy is available for influenza, etiologic diagnosis of influenza by rapid tests may be cost-effective, including reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, decrease in hospital admissions by early flu treatment, and implementation of specific infection control precautions for influenza in hospital wards, particularly among high risk patients [Woo et al., 1997; Barenfanger et al., 2000] . ILI case definitions vary among different surveillance programs around the world [Nichol, 2006] . Sensitivity and predictive values of ILI diagnosis for confirmed influenza cases vary among studies, with positive predictive value ranging from 23% to 81% [Monto et al., 2000; Thrusky et al., 2003 ]. In the present study, the ILI case definition adopted by the Health Office Surveillance System was shown to be adequate for influenza strain recovery (sensitivity of 91%) from a surveillance standpoint. In contrast, this clinical case definition was not highly predictive (31%) of laboratory confirmed influenza since 69.1% of ILI cases were caused by other agents. Similar data and implications have already been reported in other studies [Thrusky et al., 2003; Navarro-Mari et al., 2005] .",
