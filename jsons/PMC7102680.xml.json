Furthermore, B19 monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were slower to differentiate into macrophages upon in vitro culture than monocytes from the PBMC of birds with the B2 homozygous haplotype (Dawes et al., 2014). Macrophages, important cells of innate immunity, are directly involved in cellular interactions with pathogens, resulting in release of cytokines that activate other immune cells and in antigen presentation to cells responsible for adaptive immunity (Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997, Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000a, Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000b, Romagnani, 1992). Dawes et al. (2014) demonstrated that macrophages isolated from B2 birds were significantly more responsive than B19 derived macrophages to polyriboinosinic acid:polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C), which simulates viral RNA replication and to IFN\u03b3, an indicator of lymphocyte activation.",

Samples were centrifuged for 35 min (400 x g; 23 \u00b0C; brake off) before collecting the interphase cells. Isolated cells were washed twice in 5 ml PBS (400\u00d7g; 10 min, 23 \u00b0C), counted and viability of \u226590% was confirmed based on the exclusion of 0.1% trypan blue dye. Cells were re-suspended in RPMI to a final concentration of 5 \u00d7 107 cells/ml. Five hundred \u03bcl of the cell suspensions were added to each well in 24 well plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 6 days until the monocytes differentiated into macrophages at 70 to 80 percent confluence. Macrophages were counted in wells after adherence via the NIS Elements program, with cells being counted per mm2 and calculated per well as previously described (Dawes et al., 2014).",

The allantoic fluid was harvested 48 h post inoculation and virus was quantified by titrating in ECE and expressed as embryo infectious dose 50 (EID50) (Beard, 1989). Each well with a macrophage preparation was inoculated with 250 \u03bcl of virus preparation from a stock of 102 EID50 of virus. Macrophages infected with virus were incubated at 39 \u00b0C for 45 min before washing twice with RPMI medium, followed by overnight culture. Infection was confirmed after 24 h of incubation by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) (Singh et al., 2010a). Primary antiserum used was AIV (+) serum from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and the secondary antibody used was goat anti-chicken IgG (Alexa 488, Molecular Probes). Viral load in macrophages was determined with the TCID titer 10\u22122.2/500 \u03bcl at 16 h after infection by real time PCR. Primer sequences: cDNA synthesis: TGCTCTCTCGAATGGAAGGT, PCR primers: GAATCCTGGGAATGCTGAAA and GTGCTGGATTTTCGTTTGGT. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min-hot start, 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s according to manufacturer instructions for the Biotool 2x Sybr Green qPCR Mix (Biotool, Houston, Tx). Viral infections were also confirmed with TCID50 as previously described, using cytopathic effects (CPE) and the hemagglutination (HA) assay (Moresco et al., 2010, Reed and Muench, 1938). Briefly, macrophages were isolated as described above and 500 \u03bcl of PBMC in media were placed in 48 well plates at 5 \u00d7 107 cells/ml. Stocks of 102 EID50 of virus were used to infect wells at 1:10 dilutions in duplicates and CPE was evaluated by microscopy.

(2013) had suggested that innate immunity initially contributed to the enhanced resistance of the B2/B2 birds to IBV associated clinical illness. In the current study, we used AIV rather that IBV because macrophages are readily infected with AIV. Although belonging to different viral families with distinctly different properties, both viruses have single-stranded RNA genomes and both have enveloped virion particles. It should be assumed that IBV, although not readily infecting macrophages, infects epithelial cells and consequential pathology would be expected to activate innate immunity.",

However, the deficiency is not universal for all immune cells from the B19 haplotypes, since B19 T lymphocytes surprisingly not only responded to ConA stimulation, but responded significantly better than the B2 derived T lymphocytes. Upon stimulation of macrophages with ch-IFN\u03b3, Irizarry and Drechsler (personal observations) also have now found differences in a number of cellular pathways in macrophages from either B19 or B2 birds.",

Differences in macrophage function, correlating with differential innate immune responses (Dawes et al., 2014), corroborate recent studies that demonstrate a much more important role macrophages play, in general, in directing the adaptive immunity, particularly T cell responses, in a variety of diseases including cancer and autoimmunity (Mills et al., 2000, Mosser, 2003, Mills, 2012, Biswas et al., 2012).",
