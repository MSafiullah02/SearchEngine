The Quicktrach is a device that is sold as a single operating unit capable of introducing air in an airway by inserting the Quicktrach catheter in the airway through an incision in the cricothyroid membrane. The device is secured with neck tape and can be used with either a low pressure ventilator or a high pressure jet ventilator (Manujet) system. This system is advantageous in that it requires less than 1 min for attachment and involves a single step procedure, which can be critical under emergency scenarios (5). At the same time, some of the major shortcomings of this product include the unreliable neck affixing approach (neck tape) and the short cannula, which can be difficult to attach to some patients due to neck, face, or head trauma. It was also found that the device cannot adequately withstand the high pressure jet ventilation (4).",

On one hand, a study in 1999 (9) stated that none of the existing devices for cricothyrotomy was truly reliable or convenient. The four step method has been known to cause injury (13). On the other hand, another study found that BFSM had 100% success rate and non-BFSM cricothyrotomy procedures had a 25% complication rate (14). The modified BFSM and Melker system are lengthy, multistep procedures that have shown some deficiencies in ensuring proper ventilation (5). Lastly, the Quicktrach does not deliver high flow rates, making it less effective (9). A summary of the principal advantages and disadvantages of current devices as described by the other authors is listed in Table 1; the present paper did not independently verify these claims and solely lists these for the purpose of assessing various design approaches to cricothyrotomy procedures.",

This device, which comes fitted around its insertion needle, has many advantages over existing devices (15).

The device is novel in that it is self-anchoring for maximum stability using an expandable internal sock and external restraint and sliding mechanism. It is simple to insert and remove. Other features include a flow direction indicator and an optimal nozzle shape that was designed to minimize risks of barotraumas and injury to trachea wall from air bursts. Lastly, the device allows for proper gas exchange by the insertion site and requires a smaller and less invasive insertion site reducing trauma to the patient. The components shown in Fig. 1 include the flexible curved exhaust nozzle, internal expanding restraint (the \u201csock\u201d), external restraint, outer graduated catheter, inner catheter (connected to nozzle), and direction indicator and male Luer lock. Also provided are the dimensions of the device. These components would be presented pre-assembled to the clinician. Further operating procedures are discussed below.",

The outer graduated catheter will allow responder to determine depth of the needle. The syringe can be used to verify if air flow is possible. Experienced emergency medical technicians (EMTs) will likely not require this, but it was believed to be a valuable addition for both verifying air flow and as a longer grip for the EMT.2Needle (bottom Fig. 1) is removed, leaving the ENCD in place.3The device must be turned to ensure the nozzle will direct air toward the lungs. Proper orientation can be confirmed by ensuring the \u201cnose\u201d indicator flap is pointed toward the patient\u2019s nose (Fig.2d).4Device is secured against removal from the site by engaging the sock restraint. This is done by sliding the outer catheter over the inner catheter (Figs. 2b\n2c), displacing the outer catheter precisely the amount required to expand the sock (Fig. 1). The ENCD is withdrawn until resistance indicates that the expanded sock is in contact with the inner wall of the trachea.5The external restraint is slid to the outer wall of the neck, securing the device to the patient. The device is now ready for air transfer.6Luer lock is attached, which will allow the jet air into the lungs and for exhaled flow out.7An air tube is attached to the Luer lock to allow either jet or bag ventilation.\n",

The nozzles must be able to perform fours tasks: conform without permanent deformation along the needle in the sterilized packaging prior to use for 1 year (best before date), deploy back to the desired shape once the needle is removed, direct air toward the lungs, and not flap or deform during jet ventilation. The restraint sock must meet the following criteria: have a small diameter on insertion through the trachea wall, expand as much and as quickly as possible without failure, prevent extraction of the device at low forces while causing minimal trauma to the trachea wall, and pull out at high extraction forces without damaging the insertion site (a fail safe feature), thus, collapsing nearly entirely when retracted by user and squeezing through the insertion site (i.e., sock is sufficiently flexible to, either through elastic or plastic deformation, collapse when pulled hard enough and prior to causing trauma to the trachea wall during extraction). The device airflow must allow 500 mL of air to pass through into the lungs within 2.5 s (12 l/min), mimicking normal tidal breathing conditions.",

The four slit socks (d) succeeded in large numbers when produced out of Tango Plus; failures that occurred from layers delaminating at locations that were of no consequence were disregarded. Socks with additional slits were not tested; the four slit configuration provided sufficient deformation are retained the required strength to prevent failure during expansion. Socks with six or additional slit configurations would not have had sufficient material to provide the required stiffness.",

The threaded end of the jig was inserted in an adaptor developed for the MTS system, thus, anchoring the device to the load cell. The device was inserted through a minimal hole in the latex. Socks were subsequently expanded. Force displacement curves were recorded using associated MTS software. A minimum of 5 socks were tested per configuration. Three materials were used, Tango Grey, Black, and Plus. Tango Grey is very rigid and does not allow for the required deformation; premature failure occurred during expansion with all sock configurations of this material. Tango Black does not allow for high strain levels, resulting in premature failure during expansion as well. As seen in Table 3, Tango Plus provided good results, especially with 1.5 time wall thickness.",

The sock was expanded and pulled with approximately 10 N of force (half the expanded pull-out force). The number of cycles to failure for these five samples ranged between 1 and 13. Failure for these tests was defined as any change in the structure that would render it unusable (rip, tear, and plastic deformation) and allowed the device to pull out. Due to the high failure rate of the sock/adhesive during the first expanded pull-out test, these results are not statistically conclusive. However, since this process is significantly more destructive than and, in fact, would not exist in the clinical situation, the findings are very encouraging.
