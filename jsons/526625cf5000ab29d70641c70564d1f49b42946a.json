Communities therefore have to monitor the incidence of COVID-19 carefully and attempt to project the demand for health care. To enable such projections, we have developed an interactive web application that simulates an age-structured SEIR model with separate compartments for severely and critically ill patients. The tool allows the users to modify most parameters of the model, including age specific assumptions on severity. Infection control and mitigation measures that reduce transmission can be specified, as well as age-group specific isolation. The simulation of the model runs entirely on the client side in the browser; all parameter settings and results of the simulation can be exported for further downstream analysis.

The illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, clinically presents with a large variance of symptoms that range from mild and asymptomatic infection to acute severe respiratory illness.

The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (The WHO COVID-19 group, 2020).

            "text": "A critical component of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic is the possibility to explore different scenarios for local outbreaks within communities across the world using mathematical modelling. Modelling is important not only to guide governmental public health policy but also to inform hospital readiness and educate the general public on the importance of social distancing efforts. The spectrum of models used to analyze * contributed equally COVID-19 outbreaks ranges from computationally intensive agent-based simulation (Neil M Ferguson, 2020) , variants of SIR/SEIR models (Kermack et al., 1927) , to phenomenological curve fitting approaches (\"IMHE COVID-19 forecasting team\" and Murray, 2020). However, traditional epidemiological modelling protocols do not scale for a global pandemic -modelling has to be done on a region-by-region basis. Thus, to make such modeling widely available, we have developed an interactive, online tool that allows users to efficiently explore COVID-19 scenarios based upon different epidemiological assumptions and potential mitigation strategies. The dynamics are modelled by an age-stratified SEIR model, with additional novel compartments that correspond to hospital and ICU utilization with finite capacity. Our deterministic approach strikes a compromise between the accuracy of the approximation of the outbreak dynamics and the speed of the simulation. On a typical modern computer and browser, the simulation will complete in under one second such that many different parameter values can be explored interactively. The output of the model is a time series of simulated COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and ICU usage. Surveillance data such as case counts, COVID-19-related fatalities, and hospitalizations can be compared to the model output when such data are available. Additionally, we utilize these data to estimate a few basic parameters for each provided scenario to provide reasonable starting points for further parameter explorations. However, we stress that the focus of this tool is on the exploration of scenarios and not on parameter inference.",

The progression of illness is approximated by the following compartment transitions: susceptible individuals are exposed to the virus by contact with an infected individual; exposed individuals progress towards a infectious state; infectious individuals either recover without hospitalization or progress towards a severe illness that requires hospitalization; hospitalized individuals either recover or worsen towards a critical state; individuals with a critical illness either transition to the ICU or, if the hospital is at capacity, to an \"overflow\" compartment and either return to the hospital state or die; recovered individuals can not be infected again. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of the model. We note that direct comparisons between the model predictions and available surveillance data are difficult since only a fraction of cases are confirmed by a positive test and this fraction various between regions. The number of COVID-19 deaths is often a more robust measure.",

The mean infectious time of a COVID-19 case is \u03b3 \u22121 i , which together with the incubation period \u03b3 \u22121 e defines the serial interval.

Finite hospital resources and staffing acutely impact the outcome for critical COVID-19 patients and thus the overall COVID-19-related fatalities. We phenomenologically capture this effect by introducing non-linear constraint of a finite number of ICU beds C that can accommodate critical patients. Once the number of critical cases exceeds this parameters, additional critical cases are redirected to an \"overflow\" compartment. We take the mortality rate of an overflow patient relative to a patient with an ICU bed to be \u03be.",

Therefore, we give the user control over all model parameters in order to facilitate the exploration of the dependence of the predicted results on the input parameter values, see Fig. 2A for a screenshot of the UI. We note that users specify timescales instead of rates in the UI, e.g. \u03b3 \u22121 i corresponds to the \"Infectious period\" input box of Fig. 2A , as we felt timescales are easier to directly interpret.

On the left, we have grouped parameters of the population under study, e.g. the initial number of cases and the size of population. Conversely, on the right, we grouped phenomenological parameters related to COVID-19 epidemiology. All numbers can be entered manually with a keyboard or stepped with the scrollbox. B) Individual mitigation measures can be added or removed from the model via the the shown interface. Each intervention has a unique name, a range of times it is applied for, and a range of possible efficacies. The net mitigation on COVID-19 transmission is calculated via Eq. 3 1. The overall mitigation efficacy modulates COVID-19 transmissibility as seen in Eqn. 1. Additionally, our model allows for the input of simple, time-independent age-specific isolation measures. As can be seen in Fig. 3 , we provide a column for \"age-specific\" isolation. These numbers result in a reduction in exposure of individuals from specific age-groups to the general population. For example, this feature could explore the effect of measures specific for the elderly.",

The future trajectory of COVID-19 will therefore primarily depend upon the level of social distancing and infection control that is maintained.

This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that the prediction of absolute numbers are exceedingly sensitive to small variations in input parameters. Due to nature of exponential growth experienced within an epidemic, a small uncertainty in either the growth rate or initial date will naturally result in large uncertainty in case numbers. Therefore, it is critical that these uncertainties are communicated effectively to policy makers. We therefore allow the user to specify plausible ranges for the parameter R 0 and the efficacy of the interventions. In case of several interventions, this results in a high dimensional space of possibilities that we sample uniformly.

(top) A plot of the time-dependent effective reproductive number. This is controlled via mitigation interventions and seasonality. The colored line corresponds to the median and the shaded area is bounded by the 20% and 80% percentiles. (middle) Plot that shows both the interval (length) and ranges of possible efficacies (width) for the applied mitigation interventions. (bottom) Plot that shows the resulting trajectories of all compartments. The colored line for each compartment shows the median trajectory while the shaded area is bounded by the 20% and 80% percentiles. Additionally, the aggregated case count data is plotted (where available) as individual points. The display of individual compartments can be toggled by clicking on the legend. cess to their tool-stack.",
