Memory T cells achieve these functions through their high frequency and elevated activation state, which lead to rapid responses upon antigenic challenge. The significance and characteristics of memory CD8 + T cells in viral infections have been studied extensively. In many of these studies of T-cell memory, experimental viral immunologists go to great lengths to assure that their animal colonies are free of endogenous pathogens in order to design reproducible experiments. These experimental results are then thought to provide the basis for our understanding of human immune responses to viruses. Although these findings can be enlightening, humans are not immunologically na\u00efve, and they often have memory T-cell populations that can cross-react with and respond to a new infectious agent or crossreact with allo-antigens and influence the success of tissue transplantation. These cross-reactive T cells can become activated and modulate the immune response and outcome of subsequent heterologous infections, a phenomenon we have termed heterologous immunity. These large memory populations are also accommodated into a finite immune system, requiring that the host makes room for each new population of memory cell. It appears that memory cells are part of a continually evolving interactive network, where with each new infection there is an alteration in the frequencies, distributions, and activities of memory cells generated in response to previous infections and allo-antigens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary:"}, {"text": "The antigen-specific memory T-cell populations that are important in protection against subsequent infection (1) (2) (3) have diverse T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires (4, 5) but also are intrinsically cross-reactive. The TCR of a CD8 + T cell discriminates peptides of usually eight to 10 amino acids that are embedded in major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules (6) . Crystal structural studies revealed that only a few TCR contact residues on the peptide presented by MHC molecules are required for activation (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) , although a TCR can tolerate certain amino acid substitutions in the peptide sequence and still become activated. For example, amino acid substitutions for a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B8-restricted Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) peptide at positions 1, 2, and 8 were tolerated, while substitutions at positions 4, 6, and 7 were crucial for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte recognition (12) . Thus, 'molecular mimicry', whereby a peptide ligand differing from the original ligand retains sites that are necessary for interaction with the TCR (13) , is one of several paths to cross-reactive T-cell responses. However, an alternative explanation for this flexibility in TCR binding may be explained by thermodynamic studies of TCR -peptide -MHC interactions (14) (15) (16) (17) . The TCR undergoes conformational changes of the TCR complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for proper accommodation to cognate antigen, as seen with human T cells binding flu-M1 58-66 /HLA-A2.1 and EBV-EBNA3 339-347 /HLA-B8 epitopes (15, 16) and mouse T cells binding a cytochrome C epitope MCC 88-103 / H2-E k (14) . Wu et al. (17) have suggested an 'induced fit' model, where an ab-TCR with low conformational complementarity to a peptide-MHC first contacts the MHC molecule via the CDR1 and CDR2 loops, followed by readjustment of the flexible CDR3 loops to the peptide -MHC complex. This flexibility in the CDR3 molecule leads to an enhanced ability of a single TCR to accommodate structurally diverse peptides. It is possible that this kinetic flexibility in the TCR may also lead to different regions of the same TCR interacting with different sites on two separate ligands, termed as alternative recognition (18, 19) . Another mechanism for T-cell crossreactivity is the ability of T cells to express two different TCRs, due to incomplete allelic exclusion of the TCRa chain (20) . Mathematical calculations suggest that a single TCR should be able to react against 10 6 different nonamer peptides (21) . Taken together, these mechanisms make cross-reactivity very difficult to predict and a fairly common event.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 113, "end": 116, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "(4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 172, "end": 174, "text": "5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 531, "end": 534, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 535, "end": 538, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 539, "end": 542, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 548, "end": 552, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1088, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1303, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1308, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1313, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1318, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1563, "text": "(15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1567, "text": "16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1641, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1658, "text": "Wu et al.

The CD8 + T-cell memory pool created after a virus infection has a distinct hierarchy of epitope-specific responses in a na\u00efve host. Some viral epitopes are dominant, stimulating high frequency T-cell responses, while others are subdominant, stimulating weaker or barely detectable T-cell responses (51) . This immunodominance hierarchy is regulated by various parameters, including the efficiency of processing and presentation of the peptide, the affinity between peptide and the MHC-I, the availability of T cells with TCRs that recognize the peptide-MHC complex, and the competition between T cells for domains on the antigen-presenting cell (APC) (52) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 520, "end": 524, "text": "(51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 873, "end": 877, "text": "(52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T-cell cross-reactivity"}, {"text": "Many epitope-specific responses have distinct TCR CDR3 amino acid motifs that are maintained between clonotypes and between different individuals.

Conservation of CDR3 amino acid motifs suggests that these sites are required for the TCR to bind to the MHC -ligand structure.

Thus, the TCRs on the antigen-specific T-cell clones are unique to the individual, and these unique regions have been referred to as the 'private specificity' for that epitope-specific response.

This cross-reactive expansion can alter the hierarchy of T-cell responses; we saw this in sequential heterologous virus infections in mice with two distantly related arenaviruses, LCMV and Pichinde virus (PV) (34) . These viruses encode epitopes in NP 205 with six of eight amino acids in common. This epitope is normally subdominant for either virus in a na\u00efve host. However, due to a selective expansion of NP 205 -specific cross-reactive memory CD8 + T cells, this NP 205 -specific T-cell response became dominant when LCMV-immune mice were infected with PV or when PV-immune mice were infected with LCMV (34) . These data support the concept that expansions of cross-reactive T-cell populations substantially contribute to the immune hierarchies of T-cell responses. This study may explain some of the variability in immunodominant hierarchies observed in human viral infections, where the host has been exposed to numerous infections throughout life. For instance, patients with identical haplotypes infected with HIV or HCV show high variability in their T-cell immune hierarchies (60, 61) .

This outcome could be explained by the stochastic nature of clonal dominance and by the private specificities in antigen-specific TCR repertoires in each immune host. Thus, the proportion of epitope-specific memory T cells cross-reactive with another antigen would differ from host to host. This variation is indeed what we have observed in LCMV-immune hosts challenged with VV (36, 63) . In our study to predict which LCMV-encoded epitopes might be driving cross-reactive responses to VV, substantial variability was noted when individual mice were tested. In 50% of mice, the VV infection stimulated strong expansion of T cells specific to the LCMV NP 205-212 epitope, in 23% of mice they were specific to either the glycoprotein (GP) 33 or GP 34 overlapping epitopes, and in 15% of mice specific to the GP 118-125 epitope (Fig. 1A) . Often there was expansion of T cells specific to only one LCMV epitope, but sometimes T cells specific to more than one epitope were expanded. The question was whether these variations in expansion represent random stochastic events in an LCMV-immune mouse challenged with VV, where only a limited number of the cross-reactive T cells actually engage antigen, or whether each mouse had a unique T-cell repertoire in regards to its potential cross-reactivity with VV. To address this point, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE)labeled splenocytes from different donor LCMVimmune mice were adoptively transferred into three recipients, which were each then challenged with VV. The pattern of epitope-specific T-cell expansion was virtually identical among the recipients of a single donor but differed in recipients from different donors.

This narrowing of the repertoire had different patterns between individuals, and adoptive transfer studies indicated that this variation was a reflection of the private specificities of the immune system that developed after the primary infection. Most studies, with few exceptions (65) , have linked narrow TCR repertoires to poor viral clearance and an enhanced probability of selecting for epitope escape variants (66) (67) (68) (69) .

Correspondingly, although VV elicits the proliferation of a subset of CSFElabeled adoptively transferred LCMV memory cells, LCMV stimulates very little proliferation of a VV-immune population (63) . Since VV encodes over 200 proteins and perhaps thousands of potential epitopes, it is probably much more likely to encode an epitope that would activate some cells from an LCMV-immune T-cell population, whereas LCMV, which encodes only four proteins and a far more limited number of epitopes, may be less likely to encounter a VV-immune T-cell to stimulate. This finding could explain why so many large DNA viruses have evolved to encode gene products that interfere with MHC-I antigen presentation (72) . Other factors may also be involved.

The T-cell-mediated pathology during acute infection likely results from the inflammatory conditions induced by the presence of high numbers of T cells lysing infected tissues, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which recruit other cells. Disease outcome is ultimately based on a fine balance between the number of memory T cells recruited to sites of viral replication, the efficiency and length of time these T cells are present, and amplifying pro-inflammatory responses, before virus is cleared. The efficiency of the activated T cells in viral clearance is at least partially dependent on the avidity of the TCR interaction with its ligand. Studies with altered peptide ligands (APLs), which represent an in vitro model for cross-reactive responses, show that high-and low-potency ligands differ in the length of time the TCR interacts with MHC/ligand, i.e. TCR 'avidity', and modify the functional potential of individual clones (7, 79) . These studies help explain why a lower avidity cross-reactive response may not protect as well against a heterologous virus or why heterologous immunity may not be as effective at mediating protective immunity as homologous immunity.

Some cross-reactive cells bound both tetramers and produced tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), IFNg, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1b (MIP1b) to both ligands, some bound only one tetramer but produced TNFa, IFNg, and MIP1b to the alternate ligand, while some bound only one tetramer but were able to produce only MIP1b to the alternate ligand.

It seems that the apoptotic properties of epitope-specific T cells are an intrinsic property of the epitope, presumably learned during the early phases of infection and imprinted permanently in those T cells. One might expect that the ratio of NP 396 -to GP 33 -specific T cells should change in the resting memory state, and indeed there is a moderate shift to GP 33 dominance over time within this otherwise moderately stable memory population (175) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 138, "text": "(175)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 440, "end": 444, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 445, "end": 449, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 450, "end": 454, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 455, "end": 459, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 460, "end": 464, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 465, "end": 469, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 470, "end": 474, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 475, "end": 479, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 480, "end": 484, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 867, "end": 872, "text": "(175)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 990, "end": 992, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1849, "text": "(175)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-induced lymphopenia"}, {"text": "With the caveat of some subtle shifting of the hierarchies of T cells having different apoptotic properties, our studies of infections with LCMV, PV, VV, MCMV, and VSV have indicated that CD8 + T-cell memory is generally quite stable for well over a year but that it is significantly reduced after subsequent infections with heterologous viruses (34, 142, 157) . Very little information is available concerning the stability of CD8 + T-cell memory in humans, because most studies are done with persistent virus infections, such as HIV, EBV, CMV, and HCV, or with repeatedly encountered pathogens like influenza virus. Recent studies of individuals immunized with VV, the small pox vaccine, have indicated relatively stable memory populations over several decades, though the memory frequencies did decline over 10-fold (155) . It will be necessary to determine whether the VVspecific T-cell repertoires remain stable over time to assess how stable this memory is. That is because our studies in the mouse have suggested that VV may be highly crossreactive with other viruses, inviting the possibility that some of the VV-specific T cells may be maintained through cross-reactivity (36, 71) (Fig. 3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 346, "end": 350, "text": "(34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 351, "end": 355, "text": "142,", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 356, "end": 360, "text": "157)", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 819, "end": 824, "text": "(155)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1185, "text": "(36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1189, "text": "71)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1190, "end": 1198, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Loss of memory after viral infections"}, {"text": "A loss of pre-existing memory after subsequent infections has also not been clarified during human infections. With a 'larger' immune system, humans may be able to accommodate large pools of new memory cells without excluding others. The somewhat stable VV-immune frequencies, assuming that the T cells are not maintained through cross-reactivity, might argue that the loss of memory is not a major issue in human infections. However, the infections that drive memory loss in mice are major systemic infections that cause a substantial lymphopenia and then splenomegaly, so one might expect substantial memory loss to occur more frequently in children rather than adults, who do not have many diseases of this nature.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Loss of memory after viral infections"}, {"text": "We have proposed two models to explain the loss of pre-existing memory occurring as a consequence of a heterologous viral infection: the Active Attrition Model, whereby something directly kills off the memory cells, and the Passive Attrition Model, where the newly formed memory cells compete with the previously formed memory cells for protective niches in the spleen and lymph nodes as the immune response contracts (27, 71, 170) . Although both these mechanisms might influence the survival of memory, our data support the active model, occurring during the early cytokine-induced lymphopenia phase of infection (156) . By quantifying pre-existing antigen-specific CD8 + memory cells and following their frequencies through the course of infection, it is clear that their numbers go down very early during the virusinduced lymphopenia and that their recovery is rather modest. There may still be some accommodation issues in competing for protective niches later in infection, but its relative importance seems less than the active attrition in these models of infection. Because virus-induced lymphopenia is a commonly described event occurring during many human infections, including influenza, West Nile, Ebola, HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona, and even human LCMV (166, 168) , we suspect that this will be a factor driving attrition in memory in humans. There has been little analysis of the effects of human virus-induced lymphopenia on CD8 + memory to other antigens, though it is known that patients receiving IFN therapy at least initially have a loss in memory phenotype CD8 + T cells (180) . These types of issues are now being examined in controlled vaccination studies, but the vaccines may not drive the level of lymphopenia necessary to cause a loss in memory. Otherwise, the vaccinees would get sick. This issue may be best addressed in those many volunteers who get bad reactions to the small pox vaccine! Memory cell attrition during persistent infections T-cell dynamics are greatly altered during persistent infections, which not only induce proapoptotic cytokines but also drive T cells into apoptotic deletion by AICD or functional exhaustion (181) . Our studies have shown that memory T cells specific to heterologous viruses are greatly deleted after the initiation of infection with a high dose of LCMV clone 13, which will cause a persistent infection, and those T cells do not rebound in frequency (156) . In addition, when CSFElabeled memory T cells are transferred into mice persistently infected with the LCMV clone 13, a few attempt modest levels of homeostatic division, but most are rapidly eliminated. If similar mechanisms occur in humans, it would suggest that persistent infections such as HIV or HCV should vigorously delete memory to everything else that does not receive restimulation by its own antigen or by cross-reactive antigen. During persistent human infections, could residual memory T cells specific to nonpersistent antigens be cross-reactive with the pathogen driving the infection?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 418, "end": 422, "text": "(27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 423, "end": 426, "text": "71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 427, "end": 431, "text": "170)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 615, "end": 620, "text": "(156)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1290, "text": "(166,", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1295, "text": "168)", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1616, "text": "(180)", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2186, "text": "(181)", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 2441, "end": 2446, "text": "(156)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cause of the loss in memory"}, {"text": "Failure of depleted memory cell populations to recover The residual populations of memory cells remaining after the early cytokine-induced deletion during infections are ineffective in restoring their population frequencies (156) . This ineffectiveness is for two reasons, the first being that they have to compete with antigen-specific T cells responding to the ongoing infection. Antigen-driven proliferation at three to four divisions per day occurs at a much higher rate than homeostatic division (43, 182) , and the pre-existing memory cells cannot compete. The second factor is that bona fide memory cells are not very effective at homeostatic proliferation in the first place, even in the absence of an infection (183) . When CSFE-labeled LCMV-immune splenocytes were transferred into T-cell-deficient mice or mice rendered lymphopenic by irradiation or poly(I:C) inoculation, the proportion of LCMV-specific T cells in the reconstituting population of cells became, in comparison with its starting frequency, substantially reduced as the cells proliferated to fill up the lymphopenic environment. Thus, the memory cells compete poorly with the HP cells that respond to selfantigens or microbial flora (131, 183, 184) .

With each new infection, memory T cells must compete for limited space. This competition is at least partially accomplished by the preferential loss of prior memory populations by active cytokine-dependent mechanisms. Also, memory T cells specific to previously encountered pathogens but also cross-reactive with the newly encountered pathogen are preferentially maintained or expanded, such that the T-cell repertoire specific to the previous pathogen becomes permanently altered (Fig. 3) . These activated cross-reactive memory T cells play a role in heterologous immunity by modulating the T-cell immune hierarchy and the private specificity of individual antigen-specific TCR repertoires, leading to an alteration in the balance between protective immunity and immunopathology. Virus-specific T-cell responses cross-reactive with allo-antigens can also alter the memory allospecific T-cell pool and influence graft rejection and tolerance induction. Thus, getting the wrong infection in a host with a particular MHC and at the wrong time in a sequence of other infections might have significant consequences for the host.

Using the concept of molecular mimicry, LCMV epitopes were identified that induced cross-reactive CD8 + T-cell responses recognizing the VV a11r 198 epitope (shown in green). The arrows mark positions 4, 7 (white), and 6 (yellow), which are important for TCR interaction. For modeling 3-D structures of putative peptide-H-2K b complexes, we used X-ray coordinates of the crystallized TCR(2C)-dEV8-H-2K b (PDB access number 2CKB). Using Swiss-PDB Viewer software (GlaxoSmithKline R & D, Geneva, Switzerland), we mutated dEV8 to simulate the peptides whose sequences are shown in (B). The modified variants with minimal rotamer penalties were subjected to an energy minimization protocol. For graphical presentation of the simulated peptide-H-2K b complexes, PyMol software (DeLano scientific LLC, San Carlos, California) was utilized.
