Participants were recruited at antenatal preparation courses, information evenings in hospitals and in private practices, where approximately 35 000 families were reached. Overall, 782 newborns were enrolled, and of these 336 (43%) in Braunschweig, 174 (22%) in Hannover, 97 (12%) in Bremen, 91 (12%) in Munich and 76 (10%) in Halle (Saale) resulting in a response proportion of 2%. In total, 422 (54%) children were included before and 360 (46%) children after birth. The first enrolled child was born in November 2014 and the last in February 2018. The sex ratio of the participating children is 1:1. There are 27 sibling pairs within the cohort, including eleven pairs of twins. In total, 285 children (36%) were enrolled in a nested subcohort with more frequent collection of asymptomatic samples and additional blood sampling at the ages of 1 and 2 years (Figure 1).\n",

Our sample sizes will continuously increase as our participants get older and the number of biological samples is thus subject to change. Except for blood samples, all biological samples are self-collected by the parents. In the main cohort, routine nasal swabs and stool samples of the symptomless child are taken once a year for microbiome analyses. In the nested subcohort, routine samples are taken every 3 months in the first 2 years of life and yearly at ages 3\u20136 years. The collection of nasal swabs and stool samples during acute disease is triggered by signs of acute respiratory disease and signs of acute gastroenteritis, respectively. In detail, for respiratory symptoms, a swab is taken when the child shows one of the following symptoms: fever, wheezing, productive cough, or otitis media or pneumonia diagnosed by a physician, or two of the following symptoms: rhinitis, dry cough, sore throat, rigors, lack of appetite, increased need of sleep, or increased attachment according to a definition by Lambert et al.12 Swabs are taken using the Copan Liquid Amies Elution Swab (ESwab, Hain Lifescience) and transported via regular mail (typically 2\u20133 days) and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. For gastrointestinal symptoms, a sample is taken if diarrhoea occurs four or more times within 24 hours and/or vomiting occurs at least once within 24 hours. Stool samples are transported via mail and stored at \u201380\u00b0C in RNASepar Solution (Biosepar). For both, nose swabs and stool samples, we successfully tested the stability for up to 2 weeks at room temperature before starting collection. Four aliquots each containing at least 200 \u00b5l of the sample-storage solution mixture are available for nasal swabs and stool samples. Regarding completeness of biological samples, we have analysed the data of all 754 children (96%) who have turned 1 year old to date. In the main cohort, nasal swabs are 87% and stool samples 88% complete. In the subcohort, 67% and 75% have returned at least three of the four required nasal swabs and stool samples, respectively. Umbilical cord blood is taken whenever possible depending on the hospital chosen for birth. However, only 20 participants (3%) have provided samples, limiting the scope of research questions possible to address. Blood samples are taken by a physician within the subcohort at the age of 1 and 2 years and in all children at the age of 6 years (planned). We collect at least two aliquots each of 200 \u00b5l of serum and 500 \u00b5l of plasma and at least 3x106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Blood samples are stored at \u201380\u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen. Of 285 eligible participants in the subcohort, 150 (53%) have provided a blood sample after the first year of life. We expect blood samples in about 70% of these participants after the second year of life, resulting in around 106 complete blood sample sets from the first and second birthday (calculation based on the samples we have collected after the second year so far). Buccal swabs for genetic analyses are planned to be taken from all children (dry sterile swabs, Nuova Aptaca). We ask the parents to provide these samples when the child is 1 year old. Buccal samples are transported via regular mail and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. So far, 53% of the already contacted participants of the subcohort and 44% of the main cohort have provided buccal swabs.

Here, we aim to use symptomatic nasal swabs and stool samples to identify causal pathogens of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. For pathogen identification, we plan to implement a wide assay including 39 respiratory and 36 gastrointestinal pathogens (Allplex\u2122 Respiratory Panel Assays and Allplex\u2122 Gastrointestinal Panel Assays, Seegene). Our focus is on viruses and we expect prevalence of human respiratory virus and respiratory syncytial virus as well as rotavirus, norovirus and adenovirus.13 Nevertheless, research on other causative agents of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections is planned or may evolve in future collaborations. Furthermore, all nasal swabs and stool samples will be analysed regarding changes of microbial community composition over time and with respect to influencing factors like infections, vaccinations, antibiotic intake and breastfeeding/nutrition over time. Analyses based on 16S rRNA gene region sequencing are part of the analysis plan. This can be further extended to metagenome or metatranscriptome analyses for specific questions in subsets of eligible samples. Identification of the virome and mycobiome will give insights into a holistic understanding of the overall microbial development within the first years of life. Blood samples will be used to determine cytokine and serological patterns as well as cellular immunoprofiles after infections and vaccination, but may also be analysed with regard to certain microbiota enterotypes or extrinsic factors like breastfeeding/nutrition. Buccal swabs will be used to determine the genetic background, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms, with regard to infection susceptibility, asthma predisposition or responsiveness to vaccinations. In the long-term, all of these data can be connected, and once asthma and atopic diseases become prevalent in the LoewenKIDS cohort, they will be linked to the development of atopic diseases and allergies. However, it is important to emphasize that we rely on laboratories of collaboration partners regarding analyses of all biological samples. Since our youngest participant is born in February 2018, we are still gathering data and samples and have not begun with the analysis of biological samples yet. We have several aliquots of each sample and are thus relatively flexible and open to providing our biological samples for different approaches and research questions.",

Data are held by the LoewenKIDS research team and access can be applied for.\n",
