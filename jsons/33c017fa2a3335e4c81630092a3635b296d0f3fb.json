However, this rate is close to the age-based rate published 280 recently by Imperial College London of approximately 1.2% of patients requiring hospitalisation in 281 the age range 20-29 years [33] . Our explanation for such a difference might be due to most of the 282 returnees were male students, which may be mainly due to the Universities preference for religious 284 study in Iran [34] . Interestingly, the attack rate of COVID-19 amongst females was rather less than 285 male (1:4.5) in our current study, which is very different from the reports in the general population 286 There was 15% rate of COVID-19 cases amongst international students, which is substantially Paradoxically, our data show that the COVID-19 infection rate was greater amongst those who 306 wore masks while in Iran (24% infection rate) compared to those who did not wear masks (10% 307 infection rate). We speculate that this observation may be related to several factors: firstly, returnees 308 who chose to wear masks may have been involved in activities that placed them at greater risk of 309 exposure, for example, living in dormitories, attending university classes and mosques. All three of 310 these activities were identified in this study as increasing the risk of infection. By comparison, those 311 returnees who chose not to wear masks may have been largely involved in low risk activities, for 312 example, house-bound spouses engaged in domestic duties and childcare. Secondly, those who 313 wore masks may have over-estimated the effectiveness of the masks in preventing infection, and 314 thus may have neglected other measures to avoid infection, such as social distancing and scrupulous 315 hygiene. Thirdly, the masks may not have met P2/N95 standards for use against viral infections 316 and/or the technique for using the masks may have been inadequate, for example, touching the 317 outside of the mask after use or multiple uses of the same mask. We note that recommendations 318 concerning the mass wearing of masks remains controversial [39], and we urge caution in the 319 application of our data in relation to this issue. 320",

There was an exceptionally higher rate 188 of infection amongst these returnees; 16 of the 108 returnees (15%) who resided in Qom province 189 and 15 of the 49 returnees (30%) who resided in Golestan Province tested positive for On the other hand, only 2 of the 71 returnees (3%) who resided in Tehran tested positive(Figure 3).191 Notably, both Qom and Tehran were reported to have experienced a large number of infections 192 amongst the local population (>400 persons) at the time of evacuation, while Golestan Province had 193 experienced a much lower number of local infection (100-199) (Figure 3). 194 Furthermore, among these 37 identified COVID-19 infected returnees, there were 13 (35%) from 195 Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (13, 35%), 9 (24%), from Gansu Province and 7 (19%) from 196 Qinghai Province (Figure 2). These infected patients had lived in Qom Province (18, 49%), and 197 Golestan Province (15, 41%) in Iran (Figure 3). 198 For easy identification of the provinces in China and Iran, the map with all of the provinces of 199 China and Iran is provided in Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure here on the government organised evacuation of Chinese nationals from Iran to Gansu 203 Province, north-western China in response to the COVID-19 international pandemic. The selection 204 of the designated area to return to within China was mainly based on geographic location, cultural 205 background and religious distribution [16] of the returnees. There were 37 confirmed cases of 206 COVID-19 infection detected upon arrival in China, amongst the 311 returnees from Iran. The 207 highest levels of infection amongst the returnees corresponded well with the location of residence 208 within Iran and the levels of infection within the local Iranian population [17]. Conversely, the 209 likely final destination province within China (mainly within the north west of China), corresponds 210 to areas with relatively low rates of infection amongst the local Chinese population, highlighting the 211 large potential risk of reverse transmission of COVID-19 within China from returnees from high 212 risk international locations. 213 The outbreak of COVID-19 is coming under controlled in China at this stage, evidenced by the 214 gradual reduction in new cases, particularly that there have been no more new confirmed local cases 215 all over the country. The clearance of COVID-19 infection has been mainly due to the enforcement 216 of stringent restriction orders, banning public activities, minimising outdoor activities, and 217 enforcing mandatory facemasks. Of course, there is a substantial financial cost in terms of 218 restriction of travel and social gathering, shopping and working. In addition, there is very high 219 psychological stress accumulated over the nearly 6 weeks of lockdown amongst the general 220 population in China, which should be taken into consideration [18]. Thus, with the improving 221 situation of COVID-19 cases, the authorities from a number of major cities and/or provinces in 222 China have been able to lift the restrictions orders, with the expectation that this will ease the 223 people's anxiety and there will be a recovery from the business loss, commencing during April 224 2020 [19]. However, new COVID-19 cases have been identified amongst the overseas returnees 225 from Italy, Iran and the United States [17], leading to reverse transmission cases of SARS-CoV-2 226 virus exceeding local cases from March 14, 2020 [20]. This phenomenon has been aggravated by 227 the large numbers of overseas Chinese who have hastily returned to China in order to shelter from 228 the risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV2 virus, based on the recognition that COVID-19 infection is 229 almost under control in China [21]. Inevitably, such activities cause much concern about reverse 230 transmission of COVID-19 to China. 231",

The source of COVID-19 infection amongst these returnees may be 247 from the study places at the University and/or the Mosques where they worshiped. During studies 248 and/or worship, SARS-CoV-2 can easily be transmitted via close contact on the prayer mats or 249shaking hands, or even through breathing[24]. Thus, in attempts to stop the spread of the virus, 250Iranian authorities decided to limit inter-state travel between major cities by placing checkpoints251 and have halted the Friday prayers in all major cities till further notice [25]. Using the same 252 approach has proven effective in controlling virus transmission in China over the last 6 weeks in 253 combating the COVID-19 outbreak [21]. It has been reported that it may be possible for COVID-19 254 to be transmitted during flights, which has prompted the mandatory wearing of N95 facemasks for 255 crew and passengers on any incoming flights to China, and when known positive COVID-19 cases 256 are on-board, isolation in a screened-off section of the aircraft and the wearing of fully protective 257 gowns, face masks and goggles [26]. Thus, during the repatriation flight and during the short 258 interval in China prior to swab testing, stringent quarantine precautions were used, making infection 259 during the repatriation flight and upon return to China unlikely. Nevertheless, this caveat needs to 260 be acknowledged when trying to clearly identify and quantitate the infection source and spread 261 range. 262 On 19 February, 2020, the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported at Qom, Iran, 263 starting the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran. In the current study, the confirmed COVID-19 patients 264 among the returnees from Iran were all students from Al-Mustafa International University at the 265 Qom and Gelstan campuses, which together enrol 9,000 students [27]. The outbreak of COVID-19 266 at these university campuses, and the subsequent repatriation of international students' to their 267 home countries, has created an enormous challenge for the authorities to control the viral 268 transmission [28]. The most immediate concern facing the Authorities of Disease Control around 269 the world is working on blocking the viral transmission to ameliorate a COVID-19 pandemic. 270 The number of new COVID-19 cases from the returnees were more than Gansu local existing cases 271 on 17 March 2020 [29]. Importantly the routine quarantine period of 14 days for COVID-19 may 272 not be suitable for the returnees, because it has been reported that the longest incubation period of 273 COVID-2019 in China can be up to 19 days [30] and infectivity may persist for up to 21 days even 274",

This discrepancy 291 may be due to multiple factors, including the timing of the start of the spread of the infection and 292 the earlier intervention and more rigorous measures taken by local Chinese students. For example, 293 Chinese students had just started their winter vacation when the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in 294 December 2019. Additionally, the enforcement of a restriction order in Gansu: mandatory to wear 295 facemasks in public places, no public gathering and lockdown of Gansu from 28 January until 296 further notice [36] is expected to have mitigated spread. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education 297 enforced the subsequent suspension of the opening of schools and all classes have been conducted 298 online to allow the students to stay at home, facilitating the battle against COVID-19 [37]. Such 299 measures have effectively controlled the epidemic in schools. On the other hand, most of the 300 international students in Iran lived in the school dormitories with several roommates and shared 301 facilities. Another reason for the higher attack rate may be almost complete absence of precautions 302 taken by the returnees prior to their returning back to Gansu Province, for example, only a small 303 number of the students (12%) wore facemasks amongst those already identified or suspected of 304 being sick students [38]. 305",
