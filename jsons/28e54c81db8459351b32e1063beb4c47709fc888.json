            "text": "Background There are few studies on the safety and respiratory consequences of the use of a skeletal traction (ST) device in the management of femoral shaft fractures with damage control orthopaedics (DCO) strategy, particularly in cases of prolonged use. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of ST compared with an external fixator (EF) on respiratory complications and mechanical ventilation requirements in patients with severe trauma with a femoral shaft fracture managed by DCO strategy. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients with severe trauma patients with a unilateral femoral shaft fracture admitted to our institution from 2010 to 2015. Patients who did not undergo definitive osteosynthesis during the first 24 h were included and divided into two groups: DCO-ST group and DCO-EF group. In addition to trauma severity, global management of respiratory complications, the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation requirements and outcome were compared. Results Fifty-five patients were managed with DCO strategy (mean Injury Severity Score, 28.4); there were 31 in the DCO-ST group and 24 in the DCO-EF group. No significant difference in terms of the main characteristics, initial severity and associated injuries was observed between the two groups. In contrast, ARDS was found more frequently in the DCO-ST group (81% versus 54%; P = 0.035). Number of ventilation days also tended to be higher in the DCO-ST group (9 days [IQR 3-15 days] versus 7 [IQR 2-16 days]; P = 0.24). No difference was found for mortality and hospitalization duration between the DCO-ST and DCO-EF groups. Conclusion The prolonged use of an ST device in the present cohort was associated with a higher incidence of impaired respiratory function. Therefore, our findings suggest that EF is preferable to ST in the DCO setting for femoral shaft fracture, especially in trauma patients at high risk of developing delayed respiratory failure.",

The arguments for ST are that its implementation does not require general anaesthesia or transport to the operating room. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the safety of an ST device in severe or multiple trauma patients, particularly in cases of prolonged use.

This change was introduced according to an institutional protocol from 2014. If ST was initially placed in a DCO setting, EF was increasingly used following this protocol. ST was thus progressively abandoned. Choice of the DCO device, whether EF or ST, was decided by the attending surgeon. Definitive stabilization was subsequently achieved when the clinical status of patient allowed placement of femoral intra-medullary nailing. In parallel, Patients with chest trauma were managed according a multi-disciplinary approach including respiratory management, surgical stabilization and effective physiotherapy. All intubated patients were mobilized every two hours. Backrest position with 45\u00b0 angle was achieved as preconized if possible.

The development of the \"inflammatory concept\" in the late 1990s, introduced the principle of operative burden caused by aggressive and early surgical interventions, especially intra-medullary nailing [20, 21] . This second aggression following severe trauma, also called \"second hit\", was indeed incriminated in the generation of a post-operative inflammatory response responsible for clinical systemic disorders, ARDS and MOF [20] [21] [22] . Consequently, the DCO strategy was developed and is now recommended by most experts for borderline and severe trauma patients with long bone fractures [5, 6, [23] [24] [25] . In these patients, DCO has proved to be time saving, effective and safe [8] . DCO permits effective temporary stabilization while focusing on resuscitation and restoration of homeostasis in critical patients [5, 6, [23] [24] [25] [26] . DCO management is associated with a decrease in the systemic inflammatory insult that results from early orthopaedic surgery and intramedullary hyperpressure [27] .",

            "text": "All the evidences on the benefits of DCO were reported using EF for temporary stabilization. EF is a device that allows fixation of the fracture site, maintaining the anatomic axis of broken bones. On the other hand, ST was proposed as an alternative to EF because of its simplicity and the speed with which it can be applied. However, only one series has described the safety and efficiency of ST in DCO management. Scannel et al. [11] thus reported a retrospective study comparing EF versus ST in terms of pulmonary complications, MOF and mortality. These authors did not highlight statistical differences for the main endpoints and, therefore, concluded that ST could be a valuable and safe alternative to EF. However, these conclusions must be regarded with caution because of important limitations in this study. First, it was monocentric, retrospective study with a small sample. Second, the definition of ARDS in this study was questionable (i.e., PaO 2 /FIO 2 \u2264 200 mmHg for 5 consecutive days or more), which explains the low incidence of ARDS of around 5%. The incidence of ARDS in DCO management is usually around 15-30 in the literature [5, 6, 25, 26] . This methodological bias probably led to a significant lack of statistical power and an erratic prevalence of ARDS. Finally, severity of respiratory criteria probably does not allow objective assessment of all respiratory changes. The safety of ST use in patients at high risk of respiratory failure must consequently still be demonstrated, especially when its use is prolonged. Many constraints have been suggested in the case of ST implantation. First, continuous fixation of the fracture site is not ensured, which may promote delayed fat embolism, supplementary soft injuries and higher blood loss, mal-union and non-union. Second, the traction device strongly limits mobilization of the patient because of unreliable continuous stabilization and risk of micro-displacement at the fracture site. Therefore, it is reasonable to wonder about potential risks of respiratory impairments induced by ST in patients with severe trauma. In our series of severe trauma patients (mean ISS 27), where 91% had at least one extra-femoral severe injury and 85 required mechanical ventilation, the ARDS incidence was significantly higher in the DCO-ST group than in the DCO-EF group (81% versus 54%; P = 0.035). This difference would seem to be maximal in the first week (Fig. 3) . Moreover, the duration of ventilation tended to be longer in the DCO-ST group (8.5 days [IQR 3.0-14.75 days] versus 6.75 days [IQR 1.75-16 days]; P = 0.24). This comparison probably lacks statistical power to highlight a significant difference. The worse outcome was thus observed in the DCO-ST group even though the two groups were comparable in terms of initial respiratory status and trauma severity on admission (Table 1) . Our data, therefore, support a potential adverse risk to respiratory function with prolonged use of an ST device. One explanation could be that ST requires a permanent dorsal decubitus and limits mobilization, favouring alveolar derecruitment, atelectasis and posture lung injuries. Based on these findings, it seems difficult to recommend the ST for trauma patients at high-risk of developing delayed respiratory failure, when multiple emergent surgeries or ventral decubitus are planned, or when definitive stabilization is not expected in first days. EF has been shown to be in contrast reliable and relevant in these specific cases, with a possible maintaining during 3 weeks without compromising definitive osteosynthesis [26] . A prospective randomized study would be, however, necessary to confirm the superiority of EF on respiratory function.",

            "text": "Some limitations apply for the present series. First, as in other studies, there is a lack of statistical power, with a retrospective and monocenter design. Second, our study is somewhat comparable to a before/after study because of the change in DCO strategy during the study period (Fig. 2) . The usual biases associated with this kind of design could, therefore, apply, particularly the associated changes in clinical practices. However, except during the admission period, trauma severity and the main admission characteristics were comparable between the two groups (Table 1) . Third, timing until definitive fixation was slightly longer in the DCO-EF group (161 h versus 95 h, P = 0.046) ( Table 2 ). The limits of ST that applied previously probably encouraged clinicians to anticipate performing definitive osteosynthesis. Furthermore, EF was the definitive treatment of the femoral fracture in our cohort for 6 patients. The maintaining of these patients may lead to analysis bias. We hypothesize that the timing may have been inappropriate or premature in some patients, promoting lung injuries and ARDS. This phenomenon could explain the differences observed between days 3 and 6 ( Fig. 3a, b) . Fourth, our high incidence of ARDS may seem surprising at first glance, because it was higher than in other series on DCO strategy [5, 6, 27] . This higher rate is certainly consequence of the definition of ARDS that we chose. The Berlin international definition highlights mild respiratory failure. The rate of moderate and severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 200) was thus nearly similar to that in previous studies [5, 6, 27] . We assume that the detection of mild and moderate ARDS is one of the main strengths of our study. Previous work suggest when PaO2/FiO 2 ratio assessed under standardized ventilator settings, numerous patients with severe ARDS were reclassified as moderate, mild and non-ARDS. Consequently, ARDS diagnosis based on PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at ARDS onset may underestimated severity of ARDS [28] . Fifth, isolated contusions may not be properly considered as an ARDS. Indeed, lung contusion may be considered as a confusion factor and leads to false-positives for ARDS diagnosis. However, among the pathophysiological pathways involved in trauma-related ARDS, the activation of local and systemic inflammatory mechanisms, resulting from the activation of innate immunity, plays a key role. Nosological entities are numerous and potentiate themselves, such as contusion, fat embolism, alveolar collapse or pneumonia in later phase. All these entities may be superimposed and the distinction between each one of them is almost impossible. Sixth, we could not demonstrate a significantly higher risk of pseudarthrosis and inadequate consolidation with the ST device (Table 3 ). Our analysis certainly lacked statistical power regarding this. Consequently, no definitive conclusion can be drawn on these observations.",
