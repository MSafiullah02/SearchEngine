            "text": "The transition from fossil fuels to as ustainable global energy system is one of the key challenges of the 21 st century.T he increasingu se of alternative sources has given rise to significant obstacles in storage and mobility; that is, how to utilize generated electricity for transportationo rl ater use. Hydrogen is a promisingo ption for ac lean burning fuel, although issues remain over its storage. [1, 2] Possible solutions include physical approaches such as high pressures, low temperatures and physisorption, as wella sc hemical storage in thef orm of hydrides. [3, 4] Of these, amine-boranes have emerged as lead candidates due to their high storagec apacity,s tability,a nd lowe nvironmental impact. [5] These compounds have been the focuso f considerable attention, with the presence of adjacent protic and hydridic hydrogens providing an excellent system for hydrogen storage and release. [6] [7] [8] Hydrogene volution from amine-boranes may be achievedb ys olvolysis, thermolysis,c atalysis,o rs omec ombination of the above. Of these,s olvolysis creates an undesirable thermodynamic sink through the formation of very strong B\u00c0Ob onds; [9, 10] and thermolysist emperatures are often high, affording ac omplex mixtureo fp roducts. [11] In contrast,c atalytic hydrogen release can occur at moderate temperatures, often yielding well-defined products. Given the dominance of transition metals in catalysis, it is unsurprising that the d-block has received the most attention in this field, with early dehydrocoupling catalysts based on rhodium and iridium. [12, 13] Driven by considerations of resourcea vailability and sustainability, recenti nvestigations have focusedo n base metals such as titanium, [14, 15] manganese, [16] [17] [18] [19] iron, [20, 21] cobalt, [22, 23] and nickel. [5] Looking beyondthe transition metals,there has been significant work in recent years on catalysis with main group species. [24, 25] This expansion has carried throught oa mine-borane dehydrocoupling, [26] [27] [28] with one of the most noteworthy examples being a bis-(borane) reported by Wegner et al. capable of releasing 2.45 equivalents of H 2 from NH 3 \u00b7BH 3 . [29] Despite their ubiquitous nature,l ow cost, and low toxicity( barring beryllium and barium), the s-block elements are underrepresented in this area. Predominantly investigated as storagem aterials rather than catalysts, [30] [31] [32] [33] their lacko fp opularity may be due to poor selectivity and extendedr eaction times of, for example, 124 h (72 %c onversion)w ith Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 as as ubstrate, as reported for Group 1 bis-(trimethylsilyl)amides. [34] However,r ecent work is yielding more active systems. [35, 36] WhilstG roup 2s ystems have shown greater activityt owards morec omplex amineborane substrates, [37] [38] [39] it should be noted that some systems studied have subsequently been shown to exhibit \"spontaneous\" dehydrocoupling. [40] In contrast, the Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 and iPr 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 substrates investigated here showed no hydrogen releaseint he absence of catalyst.",

Ther eaction is remarkably selective, affording[ Me 2 NBH 2 ] 2 (3)a lmost exclusively (< 3% Me 2 N= BH 2 , 4,f ormed, Figure S18 ). High conversions are achieved in a relativelys hort time with low catalystl oadings (at 60 8C; ca. 99 %c onversion after 80 mins at 10 mol % [ 1] , 150 mins at 5mol % [ 1] ; Figure1a). High conversions were obtained even at catalyst loadings as low as 1mol %, with > 99 %i n6 0h at 60 8C( implying aT ON ! 100;F igure S19). Increasing the temperaturet o8 0 8Cg ives > 95 %c onversion in around 23 minutes with ac atalyst loading of just 1.5 mol %( Figure S29d ). The catalysta lso works in THF,a lbeit at as ignificantly reduced rate ( Figure S16 ), which is attributed to co-ordinationo ft he solvent to the catalysta ctive site. [43] As imilar solvent effect was seen with al ithium-based dehydrocoupling catalyst studied by Mulvey and co-workers. [44] Reactions with the related amine-borane iPr 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 afforded the dehydrogenated compound iPr 2 N=BH 2 as the dominant product (> 95 %, Scheme 1d). This reactionp roceeded (albeit slowly)a tr oom temperature ( Figure S21 and S22) and increasing the temperature to 60 8Cg ave near total conversion in less than 1hour (5 mol %c atalyst loading, Figure S23 ). The formation of iPr 2 N=BH 2 has been observed in previousw ork on the catalytic dehydrogenation of iPr 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 . [45] [46] [47] Scheme1.Synthesis of compounds 1 (a) and 2 (b), and catalytic dehydrocoupling/dehydrogenation of Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 (c) and iPr 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 (d) by 1. To put this reactivity into context, the most effective previous alkalinee arth catalystf or the reaction in Scheme 1c was published by Hill et al. in 2010. [38] This catalystr equired7 2hat 60 8Ctoe ffect high (> 90 %) conversions, and was less selective than 1,a ffording several side products including( Me 2 N) 2 BH. The same catalyst provedm ore effective at amine-boraned ehydrocoupling with other substrates, catalyzing the reaction between secondary and primary amines with either pinacolborane (HBPin) or 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN). [48] In most cases these reactions proceeded to completion in 1h at room temperature (10 mol %c atalyst loading). [48] Ar elated magnesium complex was effective at catalyzing the dehydrogenationo fiPr 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 to iPr 2 N=BH 2 ,b ut could only effect stoichiometric conversions of Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 to 3. [47] There have also been reports of magnesium and calcium bis(trimethylsilyl)amides catalyzing the dehydrocoupling of amine-boranes with amines to afford asymmetric diaminoboranes. [49] In most cases, however,t hese transformations required high temperatures and long reaction times (i.e. 70 8C, 48 hf or coupling Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 and tBuNH 2 ,2.5 mol %c atalyst loading). [49] Looking at Group 1s pecies, we can compare 1 to ar ecent lithium-based catalyst published by Mulvey et al. [36] Although relativelys electivef or the formation of [Me 2 NBH 2 ] 2 from Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 ,t he catalyst showed significantly lower activity than species 1,w ith 89 %c onversion after 60 ha t8 08Ci nt oluene (2.5 mol %c atalyst loading). Broadening our scope to the rare-earth metals,alanthanum hydride complex published by Okuda et al. catalyzed the dehydrocoupling of Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 at a comparable rate to species 1 (100 %c onversion in 2hat 60 8C, 3mol %c atalyst loading). [50] However,t he catalystw as less selective than 1,a ffording[ Me 2 NBH 2 ] 2 and (Me 2 N) 2 BH in approximately 80:20 ratio. [50] To the best of our knowledge,t here are no examples of an alkaline earth catalyst (for any amineborane dehydrocoupling reaction) that are reported to be effective at < 2.5 mol %l oading, [39] with 1 the first catalystf or which this has been demonstrated. [51] Catalyst reusability was tested by repeated injections of Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 to asolution of 1 in toluene, with reaction progress monitored by hydrogen evolution. At 10 mol %c atalystl oading, 1 was found to tolerate two consecutive injections before asignificant deteriorationofactivity was observed ( Figure S26 ). This is likely due to catalystd ecomposition from the gradual ingress of air and moisture with repeated injections. There are very few studies in the literature where the recyclability of main group catalysts for the dehydrocoupling of amine-boranes has been ascertained, [29] and to the besto fo ur knowledge this is the first such determination for an s-block metal catalyst.",

It should be noted that similar activation parameters were obtained for the dehydrocoupling of 9-BBN and N-methylaniline by Hill's magnesium catalyst( D\u00b0H8 =+ 125.1(3) kJ mol \u00c01 and D\u00b0S8 = + 85(2) JK \u00c01 mol \u00c01 ), and that this was also attributed to deprotonation of the amine. [48] The observed deviation from first-order kinetics in Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 can be explained by the insertion reactionbetween I 1 and 4 being non-rate limiting provided [Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 ] @ [1] , and becoming rate limiting as the reaction nears completion. The fact that compound 5 is fully consumed at the end of the reaction, while some 4 remains unreacted, can be explained by both speciesb eing steady-statei ntermediates of the catalytic cycle (i.e. their rate of formation and consumption is approximately equal). This means the concentration of both 4 and 5 remains low and relatively constant throughout. As the reaction nears completion, 5 is fully converted to 3 through reaction with the catalyst. However,c ompound 4 can only be consumed in the presenceo fb oth Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 and 1 (see Scheme2). As the reaction nears completion, all the Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 will be converted to 4 by reacting with the catalyst. This means that there is no Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 left for 4 to reactw ith, and thus as mall amount of 4 is left unreacted once all substrate is consumed. It should be noted that the off-metal dimerization of 4 to 3 has been observed previously,a nd may occur in our systemg iven sufficient time.
