Many clinicians and patients alike are now realizing the full potential of these digital tools, as they are forced to, for the first time, utilize them to connect in a time when in-person and face-to-face visits are impossible. Harnessing this surge in interest, enthusiasm, and acceptance has immediately been recognized as an opportunity for the field [1]. Thus, the field\u2019s next steps will also be critical in ensuring digital health is used today to deliver the best care during the current crisis, ready for any resulting mental health spike following the immediate crisis, and prepared to support future crises as well as care as usual. In this perspective piece, we draw largely from our team\u2019s experience with digital health and recognize the impressive global innovation and research in this space that cannot be captured in any single piece [2-9].",

Current evidence for apps for behavior change remains limited [17], and self-help for mental health remains equally limited [18]. Although companies will boast about positive outcomes from randomized controlled trials [19], results from higher-quality studies with valid comparisons groups, proper statistical analysis, and low risk of bias do not tell the same story [18,20]. This is not to say that mobile technologies do not have a role in care. Rather, they possess a tremendous and still largely untapped potential to augment and extend care. Our team in Boston uses mobile apps to better understand the unique lived experience of each patient [21] in both our research as well as our digital clinic. Using apps in conjunction with current care has been shown to greatly increase the efficacy of app interventions [18]; in addition, the sensor, survey, and digital phenotyping data can be used to make more informed, data-driven, and evidence-based decisions about care. Our (JT and NRR) experiences of running a novel \u201cdigital clinic\u201d in Boston offering such hybrid care confirm the theoretical advantages with real-world benefits. Now, bringing app data into telehealth visits offers a practical means for patients to share data of their lived experience during this crisis (eg, changing exercise and stress levels or response to new medications) and practice new therapy skills between sessions.",

Our team is fortunate in that we have created our own app tool (freely available and open source) [22] that we often utilize in research and care, but we realize that different apps are often needed for different situations. Picking from those different apps is challenging as many offer little protection of user data, make exaggerated claims, may be ineffective, and often are quickly abandoned because of usability issues [18,23,24]. Thus, careful attention is warranted when recommending such apps to patients [25]. Thus, relying on static lists of \u201ctop apps\u201d or others\u2019 scoring systems for selecting apps is often unhelpful and even dangerous, given how out of date these recommendations are [26]. Although many app-evaluation tools exist, our research and development of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s app evaluation framework offers a practical and ready-to-use resource today for both patients and clinicians [27].",

Consideration of these lifestyle factors for mental health may be particularly important during periods of isolation/prolonged home time, due to the adverse psychological effects of reduced exercise [29] or prolonged sedentary behavior [30], and the ongoing debate about certain types of screen time and social media usage (with quality of online interactions mattering more than time) [31]. Social distancing (which is actually physical space distancing) and self-quarantine will place millions of people at higher risk of disruption to lifestyles that likely benefited their mental health. Nonetheless, digital technologies and smartphone apps may also present a novel platform for the remote delivery of lifestyle interventions [32]. However, there is still a great need for further research to establish how this can be done in an engaging and effective way, to reach those with mental illness.",

The efforts reducing implementation barriers to video visits (also known as synchronous telehealth) during this current crisis highlight the potential to bend the curve on access to care (Figure 1). Further efforts and investments will be required to now have more access and quality as the field aims to fully utilize technologies like apps and beyond. Investing in the evidence, outcomes, workforce, engagement, and ethical uses of these newer technologies and innovations will allow them to bend the curve and truly deliver on their full potential, just as we are seeing telehealth today benefiting from its legacy of prior investments.",

Frameworks for competencies already exist [34,35], and a few have already been implemented. Our personal experience in teaching psychiatry residents about mobile mental health in formal didactics has been positive, and there are already many examples of teaching telehealth [36,37]. Training new care team members around digital health, a role we have termed a digital navigator [38], offers opportunities to easily liaison between digital and classical care. Although training does not offer an immediate solution to the current crisis, it creates the workforce and builds the capacity to support increased access to care for the mental health sequelae of the current crisis and readiness for the next.",

Ensuring all patients, especially the most vulnerable ones, have the digital literacy and competency to partake in digital care is a matter of equity and social justice. Many people today find it easy to use their smartphone to set reminders, download apps, join video calls, and connect with peers. However, many people do not, and offering training and skills building is critical to ensure digital health actually offers help to those who need it the most [39]. Our Digital Opportunities for Outcomes in Recovery Services (DOORS) program offers 6-8 weeks of group sessions to develop smartphone skills and competences that have been well received by those with serious mental illness [38] and is freely shareable for others to expand upon. Focusing on and developing programs like this one, which ensures everyone is able to connect and receive care, may not have the attention-grabbing status like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, but such programs are likely of more importance now more than ever.",

Subsidized phone programs such as Lifeline Assistance may have data, speed, and calling limits. As such, the people we serve may have to make choices about what they will download and how they will use their mobile devices, even though greater opportunities exist. Further, we need to understand how people use their mobile devices\u2014from sharing them with family, housemates, and friends to \u201crenting them for a day\u201d to access funds to meet basic needs\u2014as this will impact privacy as well as research if we are not sure whose hands the phone really is in. During this time of self-quarantine and stay-at-home orders, if one is homeless or unstably housed, charging the phone or laptop is a huge barrier as is finding public or library hotspots. For now, and in the future, we need to prepare the workforce to conduct street psychiatry and outreach work in order to carry chargers and portable hotspots and provide treatment via street psychiatry or connecting with peers or outreach workers. Some people still have and use flip phones (non-smartphones), and this population cannot be ignored. For digital mental health to impact those who are most vulnerable we must be vigilant when addressing these disparities. Ensuring digital data collected for mental health purposes is not repurposed and used for surveillance or sold for profits/marketing is critical, as any lack of trust or transparency in such a system will erode meaningful use. A focus on equity and ethics will ensure digital health truly increases access to care [40].",
