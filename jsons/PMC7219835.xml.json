A disposable 3.8-mm Ambu aScope (Ambu A/S, Baltorpbakken, Ballerup, Denmark) bronchoscope is preloaded with a 6.0-mm microlaryngeal tube. The bronchoscope handle has a connector that allows attachment of the tracheal tube. A CIV-Flex 610-637 ultrasound probe cover (CIVO, South Kalon, IA) is used, which is a 91.5 \u00d7 8.9 cm sheath. The distal end of the probe cover is cut off so that it is open-ended at both ends. The bronchoscope is inserted into the probe cover until the whole insertion cord is covered. The proximal end of the probe cover is wrapped tightly against the bronchoscope handle, with the remaining loose cuff twisted into a plait. A small Tegaderm Film (3M Deutschland GmbH;Health Care Business, Neuss, Germany) tapes both the plait and proximal end of the probe cover to the handle, forming an airtight seal. Approximately 10 cm proximal to the distal end of the probe cover, a small slit is created and the patient-end of a filter is inserted. The edges of the opening are taped around the filter, forming an airtight seal.",

The distal part of the probe cover becomes folded in a concertina-like manner, which needs to be intermittently straightened out. The filter is attached to the tracheal tube to complete intubation (Figure, panel E). The probe cover is carefully detached from the filter and SGA.

Third, 100% oxygen can be delivered to the patient by the anesthetic circuit via the filter (Figure, panel B).
