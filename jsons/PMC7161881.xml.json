These constructs are considered very efficient as vaccine platforms and therapeutic delivery systems.1 Many antigens can readily be displayed on the surface of VLPs. These antigens can be genetically or chemically fused to the VLP.2 Regarding to the reports, the immune stimulation by VLPs contains: (a) Stimulation of innate immunity through TLRs and Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) due to the expression of multivalent structures; (b) Induction of strong humoral response and also IgM in T\u2010cell independent way; and (c) Enhancement of the uptake, processing and presentation by APCs through MHC I and MHC II cross\u2010presentation pathway due to the particulate nature of VLPs.3 VLPs can be subcutaneously or intramuscularly injected. Their small diameter facilitates entry into lymphatic vessels and direct drainage into local lymph nodes. Once in the lymph node, VLPs are taken up by lymph node resident dendritic cells (DCs). This uptake is enhanced by the size and form of VLPs. VLPs stimulate CD4 T cells via the MHC II pathway, as well as highly efficient cross\u2010presentation on the MHC class I pathway.3 Generally, viral\u2010like particles, are considered as vaccine candidates because their natural properties such as multimeric antigens and their specific structures are suitable for the stimulation of efficient humoral and cellular immunity. Currently, the development of recombinant subunit vaccines (SUVs) has been significantly increased using heterologous expression systems. Antigens derived from many bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic pathogens were used for safe and effective vaccination. Five VLP\u2010based vaccines have been already approved including three for HBV and two for HPV, while in the veterinary field; a VLP\u2010based vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has been approved. Some VLP\u2010based vaccines targeting human and animal diseases are recently in late stages of clinical trials. VLPs have a positive value as academic, industrial, and commercial systems especially in gene therapy and design of nanomaterials. However, the study of the VLP\u2010based applications (vaccination, gene and drug delivery, and imaging) must be followed to show the reliability, and cost efficiency of this technology. Furthermore, the expression systems would be improved to achieve the best strategy for VLP production from different viral genes. This review will focus on VLP characteristics and its applications especially as vaccines or delivery systems for DNA, SiRNA and drugs. It should be noted that in the vaccination field whenever a viral\u2010like particle carries genetic material is called \u201cvectored vaccines4\u201d and in gene therapy, they are called viral vectors. However, for simplicity in this review, we called all particles entitled as viral\u2010like particles (VLPs).",

HBsAg has been expressed in Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and Hansenula polymorpha (H. polymorpha) (Table 1).5, 16 It is critical to consider that the viral\u2010like particles are not always formed during the cultivation procedure of the yeast cells. These studies showed that the self\u2010assembly of the VLPs in Pichia system should be completed during the protein purification.16, 66, 67, 68 The expression and self\u2010assembly of recombinant bacteriophage Q coat protein (Q\u2010CP) was indicated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. The yeast\u2010derived Q\u2010VLPs were greatly immunogenic in mouse similar to that in E.coli\u2010derived Q\u2010VLPs.69 MS2 VLPs produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae could package functional heterologous mRNAs. For example, the linkage of the MS2 packaging sequence to the human growth hormone mRNA allowed the packaging of the mRNA in MS2 VLPs. Indeed, the high stability of MS2 VLPs suggests them as an efficient delivery system for RNA\u2010based vaccines.70\n",

Such yeast\u2010derived HBc VLPs are valuable for vaccination and diagnostics.76 Furthermore, the potent multigene expression systems have been constructed in yeasts. For example, the expression of three rotavirus structural genes from a single plasmid vector led to the generation of triple layered VLPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.8, 77 However, the multimerization of protein into VLPs is not supported for the enveloped viruses (e.g., Gag VLPs of HIV\u20102), suggesting that yeast does not have the essential factors of host.8 Thus, the generation of enveloped HIV\u20101 Pr55Gag VLPs has been performed using S. cerevisiae spheroplasts, morphologically similar to immature viral particles.5, 78 In general, the construction of yeast expression systems, especially Hansenula and Pichia strains, are more difficult than bacterial vectors. In addition, the yield of VLP production is less than that in E.coli.8 Other limitation of yeast system is its dissimilarity with mammalian cells in the PTM of proteins, especially glycosylation.79, 80 Therefore, this system is more suitable for the generation of non\u2010enveloped viral\u2010like particles.",

Indeed, insect cells are able to generate both VLP types (i.e., enveloped and non\u2010enveloped). There are enveloped VLPs in clinical trials.9 The main limitation of insect cell system is protein contamination with the enveloped baculovirus particles, suggesting the development of efficient plans for purification of VLPs.85 Recently, co\u2010expression of four genes of human influenza H3N2 virus (i.e., HA, NA, M1, and M2) in insect cells led to generate influenza VLPs which protected mice against H3N2 virus challenge.86 These data suggested that viral\u2010like particles are a hopeful vaccine candidate for H9N2 influenza and probably other subtypes of virulent avian influenza viruses.87 The non\u2010infectious viral\u2010like particles of the alphavirus SAV was also generated using the recombinant baculoviruses expressing SAV capsid protein and two major immunodominant viral glycoproteins (E1 and E2) in insect cells.88 Moreover, baculovirus expression system was utilized to generate VLPs from cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), tomato bushy stunt virus, and entorovirus\u221271 (EV71).8, 89, 90 Recently, non\u2010replicative baculovirus have been developed to cope with the problem of baculovirus contamination.91 Stable systems using insect cells have been also tested.92 Moreover, silkworm expression systems were efficiently applied to generate VLPs and the surface of VLPs could be changed by some strategies, irrespective if their constructs are enveloped or not.

The feasibility of recombinant plants for generation of vaccine antigens were shown in tobacco plants, potato tubers, and others.102 This approach develops vaccine strategies which can stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. In addition, it can be delivered orally as part of a normal biologic function in human.102 The antigen expressed in plant systems shows extensive disulphide cross\u2010linking and oligomerization for formation of virus\u2010like particles. For example, the hepatitis B major surface antigen has been expressed in several plant systems.103 Plants are able to express and assemble both types of VLPs (i.e., enveloped and non\u2010enveloped) as multimeric and chimeric proteins. The high expression of VLPs in plant is easy and rapid (e.g., 1\u20132 weeks) using a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA replicon system and/or a bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) DNA replicon system.104 Another advantage of plants is the use of plant virus particles as a delivery system to present foreign epitopes. Furthermore, the problem of plant\u2010specific glycans has been partially solved using the development of transgenic plants with \u201chumanized\u201d glycosylation pathways.104 Plant\u2010derived VLPs can be used for oral delivery of vaccines. Viral\u2010like particles are more resistant to digestive enzymes than soluble proteins in body, because of their highly ordered and packed structures. For example, the gastrointestinal viruses\u2010derived VLPs including noroviruses and rotaviruses were utilized orally as potent candidates for mucosal immunization.105 Plant\u2010derived VLPs showed the same structures with VLPs generated in other expression systems accompanied by a comparable or higher immunogenicity. Some plant\u2010derived VLPs could induce protective humoral and cellular immunity and also safety in clinics.105 The studies showed that the level of protein expressed in the recombinant plants is variable and often low. Therefore, further increase in expression will be necessary for practical and efficient products.102 Recent progress in the glyco\u2010engineering of plants allows human\u2010like glycol\u2010modification and optimization of desired glycan structures for increasing safety and functionality of recombinant pharmaceutical glycoproteins.1 Some plant\u2010based systems can stabilize antigen and thus reduce storage and distribution costs.103\n",

            "text": "Virus\u2010like particles show an efficient strategy to deliver antigens to the immune system, inducing both arms of the adaptive immunity.118 Indeed, VLPs present antigenic epitopes in the proper conformation, leading to induce humoral responses.5 For example, preclinical trials with influenza VLPs indicated their capacity to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses at low antigen doses. Several authors have reported antibody response to parenterally or orally administered plant\u2010derived antigens.119, 120 As exogenous antigens, VLPs are taken up by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), especially DCs, followed by antigen processing and presentation via MHC class II molecules, DC activation and maturation through up\u2010regulation of co\u2010stimulatory molecules and cytokine production, and stimulation of CD4+ T helper cells. All these events can efficiently induce both humoral and cellular immunity.5 In addition, the exogenous VLPs can enter the cytosol of DCs, be processed and presented by MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) using cross\u2010presentation.5, 121, 122 Furthermore, the B\u2010cell activation using VLPs is robust enough to induce T cell\u2010independent IgM antibodies.7, 8 DCs loaded with yeast\u2010derived HIV VLPs can alter Gag\u2010specific memory CD8+ T cells into effector cells through cross\u2010presentation in chronically HIV\u2010infected individuals, although some Gag\u2010specific T cells in these patients did not show any response.123 The reports showed that the expression system used for generation of VLP might significantly affect direction, type and outcome of immune responses.121 For example, potent and specific immunomodulatory effects were assigned to yeast\u2010derived HIV VLPs in comparison with other expression systems.123 On the other hand, plant\u2010 or insect\u2010derived VLPs, consisting of the L1 capsid protein of HPV, were both immuno genic to an equal degree. Half of mice fed transgenic potatoes expressing HPV VLPs developed L1\u2010specific antibodies.124 The studies indicated that the VLPs are taken up by clathrin\u2010dependent macropinocytosis and phagocytosis before being degraded in acidic lysosomal compartments. VLP\u2010derived peptides are loaded onto MHC I that have been recycled from the cell surface.125 A study showed that uptake and activation of DC by VLP involves proteoglycan receptors, TLR4 and NF\u2010kB, and can be inhibited by heparin.126 Several data suggest different routes of VLP uptake by DC and Langerhans cells (LC).127 For example, LCs and DCs internalize similar amounts of HPV\u2010VLPs in vaccine design, albeit through different uptake mechanisms.128, 129 VLP uptake by DCs results in activation and cross\u2010presentation of MHC I\u2010restricted peptides with co\u2010stimulation to T\u2010cells. On the other hand, VLP uptake by LC leads to cross\u2010presentation in the absence of co\u2010stimulation. Efficient VLP cross\u2010presentation by LCs with co\u2010stimulation can be achieved by addition of CD40 ligand.128 The lack of a protective immune response after viral contact with LCs may explain why some women fail to induce an immune response against the virus. LCs endocytose HPV VLPs via a non\u2010clathrin, non\u2010caveolae, actin\u2010independent pathway, whereas DCs take up HPV VLPs both by a clathrin\u2010mediated mechanism and via macropinocytosis in an actin\u2010dependent manner. This difference in endocytosis resulted in processing and presenting HPV VLP peptides by LCs similar to that by DCs on their surface, but in the absence of co\u2010stimulation. With the addition of CD40L, LCs incubated with HPV VLPs generated the efficient amounts of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine (IL\u201012) and could stimulate a HPV\u2010specific immune response after incubation with T cells.128 Despite these differences, VLPs taken up by DC and LC were able to prime naive CD8+ T cells and induce cytolytic effector T cells in vitro.127 Furthermore, HIV\u20101 Pr55Gag virus\u2010like particles could stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses. VLP expressed by recombinant baculoviruses activated human PBMC to release pro\u2010inflammatory (IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1), anti\u2010inflammatory (IL\u201010) and Th1\u2010polarizing (IFN\u2010\u03b3) cytokines as well as GM\u2010CSF and MIP\u20101\u03b1 in a dose\u2010and time\u2010dependent manner. Furthermore, VLP\u2010induced monocyte activation was shown by up\u2010regulation of molecules involved in antigen presentation (MHC II, CD80, and CD86) and cell adhesion (CD54). Exposure of VLP to serum inactivated its capacity to stimulate cytokine production.130 The linking of VLPs to adjuvant molecules was also shown to improve the immunogenicity of the nano\u2010bioparticles.131 Adjuvanted VLPs [e.g., CpG ODN1826 or poly (I: C) adjuvants] elicited a higher titer of total specific IgG compared to VLPs alone. Furthermore, while VLPs alone induced a balanced Th2 pattern, VLPs formulated with adjuvant elicited a Th1\u2010biased IgG subclasses (IgG2a and IgG3), with poly (I: C) more potent than CpG ODN1826 in animal model.118 In addition, mice immunization with chimeric simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) VLPs containing GM\u2010CSF significantly induced SIV Env\u2010specific antibodies as well as neutralizing activity at higher levels than those elicited by standard SIV VLPs, SIV VLPs containing CD40L, or standard VLPs mixed with soluble GM\u2010CSF. On the other hand, the incorporation of immunostimulatory molecules showed significantly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell responses to SIV Env, compared to standard SIV VLPs.132 Formulation of VLPs with rough LPS (R\u2010LPS) adjuvant as well as DNA primed\u2010VLP boosted regimen were led to increase specific immune responses as compared to VLPs alone, but among them the VLP/R\u2010LPS highly enhanced immune response.133 Recent studies demonstrated the potential of the HBc VLPs as an oral immunogen. Intraperitoneal immunization with the HBc VLP induced a strong, mixed Th1/Th2 response. In contrast, oral administration of the HBc VLP generated a high humoral response with mainly IgG2a antibodies, directing toward a Th1 response which is essential in the control of intracellular pathogens.134 In addition, the intranasal monovalent adjuvanted Norwalk VLP vaccine was well tolerated and highly immunogenic.135\n",

One way to overcome this obstacle is the use of appropriate adjuvants. Also, delivery of antigen to mucosal surfaces as VLP provides an efficient way of inducing mucosal immunity. After oral or intranasal immunization with Norwalk VLP, or Rotavirus VLP without adjuvant, intestinal IgA was detected in immunized mice, which were protected from virus challenge.137 In addition, the plasma cell precursors that migrate to the genital tract are derived primarily from mucosal lymphoid tissues and often secrete IgA.138 The studies indicated that immune responses generated by mucosal administration of VLP were generally weaker than systemic administration. VLP specific IgA was higher in intestine washes following intrarectally (i.r.) than intravaginally (i.va.) immunization, and higher in vaginal washes following intramuscularly (i.m.) than i.r. or i.va immunization. Some studies suggested that the immunogenicity of virus particles at mucosal surfaces is probably a property of particulate antigens assembled as multimers of subunits. Indeed, VLP might be actively taken up by mucosal APC through the integrin receptors.137\n",

Lipoparticles can incorporate a wide variety of the membrane proteins, including G protein\u2010coupled receptors, ion channels, and viral envelopes. Lipoparticles provide a platform for different applications such as antibody screening, production of immunogens, and ligand binding assays.139, 140, 141 During the assembly of enveloped viruses, lipid ordered domains of the host cell plasma membrane, known as lipid rafts, frequently function as a natural target for viral proteins. The role of lipid rafts in the organization of complex combinations of immune receptors during antigen presentation and T cell signaling is extensively recognized.142 On the other hand, in order to improve the immunogenicity of HIV\u20101 envelope glycoproteins, the fusion of gp120 was performed to a carrier protein, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which is capable of spontaneous assembly into virus\u2010like particles.

The particles resembled native HBsAg particles in size and density, consistent with a lipid composition of about 25% and a gp120 content of about 100 per particle. Particulate gp120 folded in its native conformation and was biologically active, as shown by high affinity binding of CD4. Because the particles are lipoprotein micelles, an array of gp120 on their surface closely mimics gp120 on the surface of HIV\u20101 virions.

The immunogenicity of influenza VLPs by the recombinant baculoviruses expressing HA and M1 genes, has been detected in several animal studies (mice, rats and ferrets) even after a single dose vaccination. For example, Novavax (MD, USA) was applied in three clinical trials to assay immunogenicity and safety of seasonal H5N1 and H1N1 VLPs (Table 1).5, 156\nIM immunization with VLPs comprising of the 58 kDa the Norwalk virus (NV) coat protein (CP) stimulated high levels of NV\u2010specific serum antibodies in mice, rabbits and guinea pigs.162 In addition, oral immunization with NV CP VLPs stimulated both mucosal and systemic antibody responses in mouse model,163, 164 as well as safety and immunogenicity in humans.165, 166\nA recombinant VLP vaccine including VP1 and VP2 proteins was improved to inhibit human parvovirus B19 infection in clinical settings71, 167 (Table 1).

The most common covalent bond is generated by the hetero\u2010bifunctional chemical cross\u2010linkers with amine and sulfhydryl\u2010reactive arms.104 For instance, cysteine\u2010containing antigens can be conjugated to lysine residues of VLPs surface at a high density (e.g., three peptides per coat protein molecules). The non\u2010covalent conjugation strategy contains the use of streptavidin as linkers to attach biotinylated antigens and VLPs through their efficient and specific interactions.104 SV40 VLPs can also encapsulate various materials such as DNA (\u223c5 kb) and proteins as antigens. Insertion of a special exogenous peptide into the surface loops of VP1 produced SV40 VLPs with the ability of cell targeting. Moreover, SV40 VLPs stimulated innate immunity as a natural adjuvant. Indeed, SV40 VLPs may be a promising vaccine candidate to deliver heterologous antigens followed by the induction of CTLs without synthetic adjuvants.174 Several chimeric VLP vaccines have entered clinical trials, such as the anti\u2010influenza A M2\u2013HBcAg VLP vaccine (HBcAg VLPs displaying M2 epitope of influenza A), the anti\u2010HIV p17/p24: Ty VLP, two anti\u2010malaria vaccines (HBcAg VLPs displaying malaria epitopes), the nicotine\u2010Q\u03b2 VLP and the anti\u2010Ang II Q\u03b2 VLP.175\n",

The studies showed that only peptides shorter than 30 amino acids (small peptides) can be presented without interfering with the correct assembly of VLPs. Other limitations contain the improper folding of displayed antigens and the formation of cVLPs with heterogeneous size. To prevent these issues (e.g., assembly problems), structural studies have identified domains for different VLPs such as HBcAg, HBsAg and HIV Gag that were not necessary for VLP assembly as well as allowed insertion of foreign antigens.104 The simplest way for generation of single component cVLPs, is the insertion of peptides at the N\u2010 or C\u2010terminal regions of chimeric VLPs. Multiple fusion positions should be identified to produce multi\u2010component cVLPs inducing broad immune responses.104 The direction and intensity of the immune responses are significantly influenced by the VLP type, the foreign antigen density, and its accessibility on or within the VLP. Furthermore, pre\u2010existing immunity against the epitopes of the VLP as a delivery system may importantly change the response against the heterogenous antigen. For example, HBcAg was also utilized to display a neutralizing epitope of HPV16 L2 protein.

AP205\u2010derived VLPs were highly immunogenic in mice. Furthermore, Influenza M2 VLPs stimulated an efficient M2\u2010specific antibody response and full protection against lethal influenza virus challenge.176\nVLPs containing Flt3 ligand (FL\u2010VLPs), a DC growth factor, could effectively increase immunogenicity in mice. DCs exposed to VLPs also produced high levels of IL\u20106.177\nA plant VLP\u2010based approach was used to develop Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. A target peptide displaying amino acids 170\u2010190 of the RSV G protein was delivered on the surface of recombinant alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) particles. This construct induced high pathogen\u2010specific immune responses in immunized animals.178, 179\nIn a recent study, a peptide from an external loop of mouse CCR5 protein was inserted into a neutralizing epitope of HPV L1. The particles generated by this chimeric L1 could elicit high levels of CCR5 antibodies that specifically recognized the surface of CCR5\u2010transfected cells and blocked in vitro infection of an M\u2010tropic HIV strain in mice.161 In addition, chimeric VLPs containing the full length HPV16 E7 oncoprotein linked to L2, or the N\u2010terminal region of E7 fused to L1, could induce antigen\u2010specific protection of mice from lethal challenge with E7\u2010expressing tumor cells.180, 181, 182\nA pre\u2010S1 epitope of HBV was also inserted into the EF loop of HPV VLP recognized by HBV\u2010specific antibody.6 Chimeric VLPs produced in E.coli carried a virus\u2010neutralizing HBV pre\u2010S1 epitope in the major immunodominant region (MIR) and a highly conserved N\u2010terminal HCV core epitope (aa 1 to 60) at the C\u2010terminal region of the truncated HBV core VLPs (HBc). The presence of two different foreign epitopes within the HBc molecule did not interfere with its VLP\u2010forming potential, with the HBV pre\u2010S1 epitope exposed on the surface and the HCV core epitope buried within the VLPs. Mice vaccination showed a specific T cell activation by both foreign epitopes and a high\u2010level antibody response against the pre\u2010S1 epitope, whereas an antibody response against the HBc carrier was inhibited.183\nThe researchers have shown that the nanosized HBc\u2010VLPs bearing mycobacterial antigen CFP\u201010 (HBc\u2010VLP: CFP\u201010 fusion protein) induced an increased immune response in Balb/c mice compared to mixtures of native antigen.184\nChimeric papillomavirus VLPs based on the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV\u20101) L1 protein were designed by replacing the 23\u2010carboxyl\u2010terminal amino acids of the BPV1 major protein L1 with a synthetic \u201cpolytope\u201d minigene, containing known CTL epitopes of human PV16 E7 protein, HIV IIIB gp120 P18, Nef, and reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins, and an HPV16 E7 linear B epitope. The chimeric L1 protein assembled into VLPs in insect cells. Polytope VLPs could deliver multiple B and T epitopes as immunogens to the MHC class I and class II pathways. This study has demonstrated that hybrid VLPs can be used as an efficient antigen delivery system to transfer more than one CTL epitope through MHC class I pathways.185\nThe chimeric HPV VLPs were generated in which HPV16 L2 neutralization epitopes (L2 residues 69\u201381 or 108\u2013120) are inserted within an immunodominant surface loop (between residues 133 and 134) of the L1 major capsid protein of BPV1. Immunization of rabbits with assembled particles elicited high L2\u2010specific serum antibody responses.186, 187 The self\u2010assembly of a chimeric HPV16 L1 harboring the M2e influenza epitope in plants also represented an efficient expression of chimeric HPV 16 L1 harboring an epitope of a heterologous virus.188\nThe chimeric BPV L1 protein with insertion of a polyglutamic\u2010cysteine residue in the BC, DE, HI loops and the H4 helix was constructed. The polyanionic sites on the surface of VLPs were recognized with a polycationic MUC1 peptide containing a polyarginine\u2010cysteine residue linked to twenty amino acids of the MUC1 tandem repeat through electrostatic interactions and redox\u2010induced disulfide bond formation. MUC1\u2010fully assembled VLPs induced MUC1\u2010specific CTL, delayed the growth of MUC1 transplanted tumors and induced complete tumor rejection in some animals.189\nIn a study, six amino acids encoding for the epitope 78\u201083 (DPASRE) of the HBc antigen were introduced within the different loops of the L1 protein at positions 56/57, 140/141, 179/180, 266/267, 283/284 or 352/353. All these chimeric L1 proteins were able to self\u2010assemble into VLPs. All VLPs could stimulate neutralizing antibodies in different levels.190\nPlant viruses can be genetically modified to generate chimeric VLPs harboring heterologous peptides.191 The studies demonstrated the potential to produce multi\u2010gram amounts of chimeric CPMV VLPs in plants for development of peptide\u2010based vaccines.192 In addition, potato virus X (PVX) was used to display the H\u20102Db\u2010restricted epitope ASNENMETM of influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) on VLP surface. The results indicated that cVLPs activate ASNENMTEM specific CD8+ T cells without co\u2010administartion of adjuvants.191 Furthermore, the highly conserved ELDKWA epitope from HIV\u20101 glycoprotein 41 was expressed as an N\u2010terminal translational fusion with the PVX coat protein. The resulting cVLPs in plant could induce high\u2010titers of HIV\u20101\u2010specific IgG and IgA antibodies in mice model.193\nThe studies showed that the C\u2010terminal region of Gag fused by T cell epitopes from human cytomegalovirus pp65 led to the formation of hybrid VLPs activating antigen\u2010specific CD8+ memory T cells ex vivo.161 Regarding to previous studies, the Gag polyprotein is the only retroviral protein required for VLP formation.194, 195, 196 VLPs, derived from an avian retrovirus, were applied to deliver proteins to cells, either as part of Gag fusion proteins (intracellular delivery) or on the surface of VLPs. The construct is an effective system because the VLPs are completely made of the Gag fusion protein, and a single VLP will deliver 2000\u20105000 copies of Gag fusion protein into a transduced cell.197\n\n",

The pseudovirus induced more potent immune responses than DNA vaccines. The pseudovirus could be used in gene therapy by transferring the therapeutic genes into lymphoid tissues in human.5 In addition, the recombinant HPV16 L1 VLPs, produced in insect cells, could efficiently encapsulate a plasmid harboring either a gene for the GFP or \u03b2\u2010galactosidase during in vitro disassembly\u2010reassembly of VLPs.200 VLP\u2010mediated delivery of a GFP reporter construct in vitro showed to be highly dependent on the presence of full\u2010length L2 protein within the VLPs. Similarly, expression of GFP and luciferase reporter plasmids in vivo was efficiently enhanced by co\u2010administration of L1/L2 VLPs. In addition, co\u2010administration of VLPs with a HPV16 E6\u2010expressing plasmid increased significantly E6\u2010specific cellular immune responses.201 The reports indicated that the recombinant major structural protein of the BK polyomavirus (BKV VP1) was shown to self\u2010assemble into VLPs with a diameter of 45\u201050 nm. The potential of BKV VP1 VLPs was investigated to transfer gene into COS\u20107 cells using three methods for the formation of pseudovirions: disassembly/reassembly, osmotic shock and direct interaction between VLPs and plasmid DNA. The most efficient method is the direct interaction between VLPs and linearized plasmid DNA. The findings generally demonstrated that BKV VLPs have exogenous DNA\u2010binding activity, as a promising vehicle for gene transfer studies.200\n",

Systemic delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) was restricted by its poor stability and low cell\u2010penetrating properties. To overcome these limitations, an efficient siRNA delivery system was designed using polyethyleneimine (PEI)\u2010coated VLPs derived from adeno\u2010associated virus type 2 (PEI\u2010AAV2\u2010VLPs). Generally, one of the strategies to integrate siRNA into nanoparticles was to coat these particles with positively charged polymers, including PEI, poly \u03b2\u2010amino ester, or poly L\u2010lysine. Electrostatic coating could increase the efficiency of systemic siRNA delivery due to its protective effects and improved cellular uptake. An insect/baculovirus expression system was used to generate AAV2\u2010VLPs. PEI\u2010AAV2\u2010VLPs could condense siRNA, protect it from enzymatic degradation, transfer it with high efficiency and induce cell death in MCF\u20107 breast cancer cells, for breast cancer therapy.201 Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in immunoregulation and may be involved in the pathogen esis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Among these SLE\u2010related miRNAs, miR\u2010146a, acts as a significant inhibitor of autoimmunity, myeloproliferation, and cancer. A novel miRNA\u2010delivery approach was described via bacteriophage MS2 VLPs for evaluation of the therapeutic effects of miR\u2010146a, in BXSB lupus\u2010prone mice. Treatment with MS2\u2010miR\u2010146a VLP increased the level of mature miR\u2010146a, leading to a significant reduction in the expression of autoantibodies and total IgG. Furthermore, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 were decreased in mice. The stimulation of dysregulated miRNAs by an MS2 VLP\u2010based delivery system may be considered as a novel therapy.202, 203, 204 The use of MS2 VLPs was reported for selective delivery of nanoparticles, chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNA cocktails, and protein toxins to human HCC.205 In addition, the researchers used JC virus (JCV) VLPs as a vector for delivering RNAi in silencing the IL\u201010 cytokine gene. JCV VLPs were non\u2010toxic, and showed the therapeutic use as a gene therapy approach for autoimmune diseases (AID) including SLE.206, 207\n",

            "text": "A major challenge in pharmacology is to find methods that drugs (especially anti\u2010cancer drugs) can be delivered specifically to target tissues. A potential strategy would be to package or encapsulate the drug molecules inside a particle which is bound to the cancerous tissue. Such encapsulation would protect the drug from degradation in blood. For this purpose, it will be necessary to develop particles which can be modified on their outer surface to carry drug molecules into the target cells. Novel nanocarriers such as dendrimers, liposomes, polymersomes, micelles, and VLPs indicated high potency in improving drug delivery, and targeting strategies. All of these delivery systems make drugs more biocompatible, water\u2010soluble, or colloidal, indicating low toxicity and high uptake in cells.208 Different virus\u2010based materials were studied for drug delivery such as: the CCMV, the CPMV, the red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), MS2 RNA\u2010containing bacteriophage, the bacteriophage Q\u03b2, M13 bacteriophage, the TMV.208 Drug cargo can be loaded through covalent attachment of drugs or their analogs to particular reactive residues on the capsid proteins.209 Several cancer cell targeting ligands were attached to different types of VLPs, including small molecules, antibodies, peptides and proteins, as well as DNA aptamers. Folic acid (FA) was broadly used in drug delivery targeted to cancer cells. Uptake of FA into cells is mediated by the folate receptor (FR).210 Recently, lactobionic acid (LA) was applied for the specific targeting of a rotavirus capsid VP6 to hepatocytes or hepatoma cells bearing asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs).211 Human holo\u2010transferrin (Tfn) is essential for iron homeostasis. Tfn is especially recognized by the Tfn receptor (TfnR), which is over\u2010expressed on the surface of various tumor cells and efficiently taken up by cells in the clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis.212, 213 Tfn has been conjugated to CPMV214 and bacteriophage Q\u03b2.215 The cellular uptake of the Q\u03b2\u2010Tfn particles was relative to the Tfn density; while the internalization was prevented by comparable concentrations of free Tfn. Antibodies contain another group of targeting proteins that could be chemically linked to VLPs. For instance, a single\u2010chain (scFv) antibody that recognizes the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) over\u2010expressed in a variety of tumor cells, has been attached to CPMV.216 An important strategy to improve cellular uptake of therapeutic molecules is the use of cell\u2010penetrating peptides (CPPs).217 The HIV\u20101 tat peptide is one of the CPPs that were extensively used in the delivery of VLPs.218, 219 In general, virus\u2010like particles represents an attractive system for drug delivery in vitro.220 The efficient delivery of hydrophobic drugs into target cells without the use of organic solvents or chemical linkage to delivery carriers is a critical issue in the biological field. Recently, the intracellular delivery of hydrophobic dyes or drugs encapsulated in VLPs through cyclodextrins (CDs) showed high efficiency. As a model anticancer drug, paclitaxel (PTX)\u2010CD complexes encapsulated inside VLPs exhibited a dose\u2010dependent cytotoxic effect with a 20\u2010fold smaller IC50 than that of free PTX dissolved in DMSO.221\n",

For instance, bacteriophage MS2 VLPs, were chemically conjugated to a targeting peptide (SP94) for the selective delivery of nanoparticles, chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNA cocktails and protein toxins to human HCC.223, 224, 225 Recently, the chemical conjugation of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) to simian virus 40 VLPs allowed for cell selective targeting.226\nSimian viruses 40 VLPs have attracted a great attention in gene delivery due to their high stability and low toxicity in blood.172\n",

However, in the case of nanobioassemblies, chemical or genetic modification can be applied for bioconjugation of fluorescent dyes or other probes. Another advantage of nanobioassemblies such as VLPs for bioimaging is their biological compatibility. Quantum dots (QDs) and GFP were used broadly for in vitro and in vivo imaging as alternatives to labelling. For example, fluorescent chimeric VLPs of canine parvovirus were expressed in insect cells.227 To create the fluorescent chimeric VLPs of canine parvovirus, GFP was genetically engineered onto the N\u2010terminal region of the viral protein VP2, as a visualization tool to understand mechanisms of viral infections.

They have a special benefit against other delivery systems in size, stability, and capacity to transfer biological molecules across cell barriers. Particles in the 20\u2013200 nm range can stimulate CD4+, CD8+ cells and especially generate Th1 responses. In addition, despite a limited number of VLP vaccines approved for human use, they represent a promising platform for the development of novel mucosal vaccine strategies. Indeed, VLPs are sufficiently small, and the composition of their surface chemistry can be designed to minimize hydrophobic and electrostatic adhesive interactions with mucus. They can also be engineered for recombinant expression of multiple antigenic epitopes and for incorporation of co\u2010stimulatory and immuno\u2010regulatory proteins. However, VLP technology can be limited by difficulties of scale\u2010up and the need for purification from the expression systems.231 Other limitation in chimeric VLP vaccine is to determine the compatibility of peptide with assembly of VLP and its immunogenicity property. Under the host immune defence, pathogens undergo mutation which render the VLP vaccine ineffective and will be effective for only highly conserved B or T cell epitopes.230 The major challenge is to develop novel production platforms that can deliver VLP vaccines while significantly reducing production times and costs.104\n",
