            "text": "Acute lung injury and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are leading factors of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [1]. Histologically, acute lung injury/ARDS is characterized by hypoxemia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, low lung compliance, and widespread capillary leakage [2]. Airway inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a primary component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, can lead to various human disorders including acute lung injury by triggering severe inflammation [3]. In animal models, LPS challenge has been shown to promote rapid infiltration of inflammatory cells, consequently resulting in the release of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2) [4, 5]. LPS can stimulate many intracellular signaling pathways, in particular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Mammalian MAPKs include three subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. It has been documented that MAPKs are involved in the inflammatory response of lung injury [6]",

            "text": "Severe inflammation is commonly linked to induction of oxidative stress [7]. Oxidative stress usually occurs when there is an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination. Excessive ROS may exacerbate pathological inflammation and tissue damage [8]. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an important antioxidant enzyme that can be induced by oxidative stress. It has been shown that activation of HO-1 confers protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in rats [9]. Nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) also contributes to lung inflammatory injury due to oxidative stress [10]. Therefore, identification of therapeutic approaches to treat inflammation and oxidative stress is of importance for acute lung injury/ARDS.",

Arctigenin was dissolved in 0.5 % DMSO at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Mice were administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 50 mg/kg/day arctigenin 1 h before exposure to LPS. To control for the toxic effects of the arctigenin solution, 0.5 % DMSO (a vehicle) was used. There was no evidence of lung injury after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 % DMSO alone for 4 consecutive days (data not shown). Mice were anesthetized with i.p. ketamine and acetylpromazine (150 and 13.5 mg/kg, respectively) before exposure of the trachea. Escherichia coli LPS (E. coli serotype O111:B4; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was administrated intratracheally during inspiration at a dose of 10 mg/kg via a 20-gauge catheter. Physical saline intratracheally given to the mice did not cause evident damage to the lung and was thus used as a control for LPS. At 4 days after instillation [17], mice were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and lung tissues were collected. This time point was chosen because our prior experiments showed the onset of severe lung injury at 4 days after LPS challenge. The left lung was fixed and embedded in paraffin for morphological analysis. BALF samples were taken from the right lung. After the collection of BALFs, lung tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for Western blot analysis and NO production.",

It has been reported that arctigenin suppresses neuroinflammation in a focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rat model [19]. Our data revealed that arctigenin inhibited LPS-induced lung inflammatory injury, evidenced by decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar wall thickening. Massive inflammation causes vascular leakage in the lung of LPS-induced mouse [20]. We found that LPS elevated the levels of total protein and albumin in BALFs. Interestingly, arctigenin significantly inhibited LPS-induced vascular leakage. Inflammatory cell migration and infiltration are an important factor leading to lung damage [21]. LPS enhanced the inflammatory cell influx into BALFs. Arctigenin pretreatment attenuated the numbers of leukocyte (macrophage, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) migrating into the alveoli. LPS challenge induces rapid infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocyte, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemotactic factors [22, 23]. Subsequently, inflammation is induced in alveolar space and epithelial-endothelial barrier is disrupted, resulting in the lung injury. ELISA assay showed that arctigenin inhibited the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MIP-2 in BALFs. Collectively, our results indicate that arctigenin inhibits LPS-induced acute lung inflammation through suppressing inflammatory cell influx and cytokine and chemokine secretion in BALFs.",

The antioxidative activity of arctigenin has also been described in other different biological settings. For instance, Swarup et al.
