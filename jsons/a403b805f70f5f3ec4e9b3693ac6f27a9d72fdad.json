Here we show that there is already a sufficient amount of data collected in Italy to predict the outcome of the process. We show that using the proper metric, the data from Hubei Province and Italy has striking similarity, which enables us to calculate the expected number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths by the end of the process. Our predictions will improve as new data points are generated day by day, which can help to make further public decisions. The method is based on the data analysis of logistic growth equations describing the process on the macroscopic level. At the time of writing of the first version, the number of fatalities in Italy was expected to be 6000, and the predicted end of the crisis was April 15, 2020. In this new version, we discuss what changed in the two weeks which passed since then. The trend changed drastically on March 17, 2020, when the Italian health system reached its capacity limit. Without this limit, probably 3500 more people would have died. Instead, due to the limitations, 17.000 people are expected to die now, which is a five-fold increase. The predicted end of the crisis now shifted to May 8, 2020.",

Both of them have some subjective elements, and never the less the deaths data seems to be more objective. In Fig.1 , we show the daily growth rate of death cases. Since the reporting of death cases is uneven, deaths are sometimes reported a day later. Therefore we calculate the daily rate from the average of two consecutive days \u03bb n = 0.5 \u00b7 (N n \u2212 N n\u22122 )/N n . The first data point is January 24, 2020, three days after the lockdown of Wuhan. The daily growth rate is fluctuating around 25-30%, which seems to be the \"natural\" rate of growth in the absence of public actions. Then 14 days after the lockdown at about 500 deaths, the daily growth rate drops to about 10%. Then a linear trend sets in with some fluctuations due to some errors in the reporting. The slope of the linear fit is \u03bb 0 /N \u221e = 4.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b7 10 \u22125 , \u03bb 0 \u2248 0.146, and N \u221e \u2248 3158.",

In Fig.3 , we show the daily growth rate of fatalities again as a function of the cumulative number of deaths. We keep the original linear fit too, which would lead to about 6000 deaths. Instead, the slope changed sharply on March 17, and the new, clearly visible trend predicts about N \u221e = 19557 \u00b1 1670 deaths. The new slope is \u03bb 0 /N \u221e = 8.1 \u00b7 10 \u22126 , and the rate of deaths falls only 0.8% for every 1000 new deaths. The reason for this radical change in the slope is probably not related to the progress of the epidemic. The number of deaths is simply a proxy for the size of the epidemic. It depends on the number of people infected and the probability of death. We assume that the latter changed drastically when the Italian health Fig.2 , while the black line is fitted to the data from March 17 to 30, 2020.",
