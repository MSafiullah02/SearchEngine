A small number of particles of this pathogen is sufficient for infection. Severe disease is mostly observed in the elderly, children and immunocompromised people (Teunis et al\n2008).",

            "text": "Noroviruses belong to the Caliciviridae family and are non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. Human norovirus genomes are 7.4\u20137.7 kb in length and have three open reading frames (ORFs). The non-structural proteins, such as the RNA dependent polymerase (RdRp), are encoded by ORF1, while the structural proteins are encoded by ORF2 (VP1) and ORF3 (VP2) (Xi et al\n1990, Jiang et al\n1993). The major capsid protein VP1 forms dimers, which assemble into the viral capsid with T  =  3 icosahedral symmetry of approximately 36\u201342 nm diameter. VP2 is considered as minor capsid protein and carries multiple functions, which are still not completely deciphered (Vongpunsawad et al\n2013). VP1 can be divided into a shell (S) domain and a protruding (P) domain, which is further subdivided into P1 and P2. The S domain forms a scaffold surrounding the viral RNA with a diameter of 30 nm, whereas the genetically more variable P domain builds the viral spikes and facilitates cell attachment (Prasad et al\n1994, 1999). Research on human noroviruses has been limited by the lack of a robust cell culture system. Nevertheless, production of virus-like VP1 particles (VLPs) show comparable characteristics to the native virion (Jiang et al\n1992). Electron microscopy (EM) and x-ray crystallography studies have deepened the understanding of capsid assembly and interactions with potential receptors like human histo-blood group antigens (Harrington et al\n2002, Tan and Jiang 2005).",

Here, intact non-covalent protein complexes are transferred into the gas phase from an aqueous solution of a volatile buffer surrogate, such as ammonium acetate, via nano-electrospray ionization (ESI). All coexisting oligomers can be detected with high sensitivity, allowing to monitor assembly processes. Recently, charge detection MS has been introduced, enabling simultaneous charge and mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio determination and therefore mass assignment of single ions (Keifer et al\n2017). VLPs can also be analyzed by mobility-based approaches (Weiss et al\n2015). However, ESI with time-of-flight (ToF) detectors are mostly employed, which rely on charge state resolution for exact mass assignment of m/z signals.",

VLPs completely disassembled at low ionic strength and alkaline pH, whereas smaller particles formed at high ionic strength in alkaline conditions. Most importantly, they showed that small VLPs, which were previously observed in EM under alkaline conditions, corresponded to T  =  1 capsids. The dynamic behavior of VP1 upon changing pH may have implications for the infection process as the virus passes through very different environments in the intestinal tract. Using ion mobility, pH dependent intermediates were shown to be consistent with partial capsid structures and an assembly pathway was proposed (Uetrecht et al\n2011). These findings confirmed previous studies, which combined EM with spectroscopic techniques like circular dichroism and high resolution second-derivative UV absorption spectroscopy (Ausar et al\n2006).",

Noroviruses can be divided into at least seven genogroups (GI-GVII), with GI, GII, and GIV causing infections in human. Each genogroup can be further subdivided into numerous genotypes based on the capsid amino acid sequences (Kageyama et al\n2004, Hansman et al\n2006). The prototypical Norwalk virus (GI.1 Norwalk) is rarely found to cause outbreaks nowadays. It is replaced by strains of the genogroup II, where GII.4 noroviruses have been prevalent (Eden et al\n2013). A reemerging genotype of this genogroup, GII.17, seems to become a major threat nowadays in East Asia. First isolated in 1978, they were the cause of several outbreaks in Asia in 2014 to 2015 (Chan et al\n2015, Lee et al\n2015, Zhang et al\n2015, Singh et al\n2016).",

Surprisingly, the outbreak-causing isolate showed a much stronger resistance to pH.

Ions were introduced via a nano-ESI source into the vacuum at a source pressure of 10 mbar using both premade (Waters, Manchester, UK) and handmade capillaries. For the in-house production, borosilicate glass tubes (inner diameter 0.68 mm, outer diameter 1.2 mm with filament; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, USA) were pulled using a two-step program in a micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, USA) with a squared box filament (2.5  \u00d7  2.5 mm). The capillaries were gold-coated using a sputter coater (Quorum Technologies Ltd., East Sussex, UK, 40 mA, 200 s, tooling factor of 2.3 and end bleed vacuum of 8  \u00d7  10\u22122 mbar argon) and opened directly on the sample cone of the mass spectrometer. Voltages of 1.55\u20131.65 kV and 145\u2013155 V were applied to the capillary and cone, respectively. Xenon was used as a collision gas at a pressure of 2.0  \u00d7  10\u22122 mbar to improve the transmission of large ions (Lorenzen et al\n2007). Starting from 10 V, collision energies were increased up to 200 V in steps of 25 V. The presented spectra were generally recorded at 50 V collision energy. MS profile and pusher settings were kept constant for all measurements. A caesium iodide spectrum was recorded the same day in order to test the performance of the instrument and to calibrate spectra where necessary. Analysis was performed using MassLynx\u2122 (Waters, Manchester, UK). In order to generate intensity fraction plots, signals were accumulated over 100 s and in a respective m/z range all signals belonging to the broad ion distributions of a given oligomer were summed. The range was kept constant for both variants to simplify comparison, although ion distribution widths varied.

They observed the intact T  = 3 capsid, at neutral and near neutral pH, which disassembled upon alkaline treatment into VP1 oligomers. Whereas the prototypical GI.1 Norwalk virus was investigated previously, the GI.1 West Chester variant is studied here. Our assignment of ion distributions is analogous to the Norwalk results (Shoemaker et al\n2010), since VP1 heterogeneity again precluded charge state resolution (figure S1). The broad ion distribution around m/z 40 000 indicates the presence of intact VLPs consisting of 180 copies of the VP1 protein (figure 1). The observed m/z is in line with the linear relation of charge state to the square root of the mass (Heck and van den Heuvel 2004) and is therefore assigned to T  =  3 particles. Following this scheme, further VP1 oligomers, namely VP1 80 mers and 60 mers (T  =  1), can be assigned in high ionic strength solutions (250 mM ammonium acetate) at pH ranging from 6\u201310 (figure 1). Intact T  =  3 is observed at pH 6 and pH 7. A shift of the corresponding ion distribution at pH 8 indicates that T  =  3 disassembles and instead VP1 80 mers form. A second dominant ion distribution is located around m/z 20 000. Ions in this m/z region can be assigned to the T  =  1 capsid. These ions are detected at pH 6 up to pH 9 and high ionic strength, although with strongly decreasing signals at alkaline pH. Several smaller oligomers are detected up to pH 8 between m/z 10 000\u201320 000 in line with disassembly of T  =  3 and reformation of 80 mer particles. The dominant signal around m/z 15 000 corresponds to VP1 18 mers already detected at pH 6. VP1 6 mers and 4 mers are observed in solutions at pH 7 and higher. VP1 dimers are present in all tested solutions with strongly increasing signals upon alkaline treatment. To further illustrate and confirm the different VP1 oligomers, the ammonium acetate VLP preparations were imaged in negative stain EM (figure 2). At pH 6 and pH 7, round structures with a diameter of about 40 nm corresponding to intact T  =  3 capsids can be found. Smaller particles with a diameter of about 20 nm are also seen in pH 6\u20138, likely the detected T  =  1 particles. Size estimation is affected by aggregation. However, a clear trend in line with the MS measurements is observed as bigger spherical structures are no longer visible at pH 9 and 10.",

In both protocols a baculovirus expression system was used and VLPs were purified via CsCl gradient centrifugation. The T  =  1 particles with a diameter of approximately 21 nm are a known byproduct in VLP production and also found in stool samples (Taniguchi et al\n1981, White et al\n1997). Truncated VP1 proteins were described as a possible reason for formation of smaller particles (Huo et al\n2015). The versions of West Chester VP1 observed in the low m/z region after particle disassembly show differences in methionine processing (\u0394m ~ 270 Da per monomer) as was previously described for Norwalk VP1 (Shoemaker et al\n2010). Therefore, the T  =  1 formation likely represents an intrinsic property of the VP1 protein. This is also in agreement with the observation of T  =  3 particles at neutral pH of the Norwalk virus S domain (Baclayon et al\n2011). Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that small particles in stool samples are T  =  3 particles lacking the P domain or other aberrant assemblies. Furthermore, West Chester VLPs are more sensitive to alkaline treatment as they disassemble at even lower pH than the previously described Norwalk virus (Shoemaker et al\n2010). Smaller oligomers, such as the VP1 18 mer, are also detected at lower pH values for the West Chester. Importantly like Norwalk, the West Chester virus retained the ability to reversibly assemble when diluted from a high pH solution into a low pH solution including reformation of T  =  1 particles (figure S2).",

It is therefore of interest, whether these still exhibit a similar stability profile as GI noroviruses, in other words whether particle stability is a conserved feature in noroviruses. Therefore, GII.17 Kawasaki VLPs are also analyzed with native MS (figure 3). Broad ion distributions corresponding to the T  =  3 and T  =  1 intact capsids are detected throughout the whole pH range (pH 6\u201310) both at low (50 mM ammonium acetate, figure 3) and high ionic strength (250 mM ammonium acetate, figure S3(A)). The ratios of the capsid sizes remain unchanged up to pH 9. At pH 10, mild disassembly is observed, as is evident from the arising dimer signal. Based on the intensity fractions, no preference for disassembly of either capsid form is observed. Disulfide bonds as cause of this extraordinary stabilization can be excluded, as no additional bands corresponding to oligomers are observed under non-reducing conditions in SDS-PAGE (figure S4).",

At pH 9, also T  =  1 particles have disappeared. Thus, West Chester VLPs maintain a lower stability at lower ionic strength as was shown for Norwalk VLPs (Shoemaker et al\n2010). Conversely, the Kawasaki VLPs show a more intense VP1 dimer signal at pH 10 at higher ionic strength indicative of decreased stability (figures 3(C) and S3(C)).

The influence of temperature, ionic strength and pH on the adhesion of VLPs to surfaces also revealed higher stability and more adhesion for GII.4 viruses than GI.1 (da Silva et al\n2011, Samandoulgou et al\n2015). However, the investigated pH range was limited. In 2010, Donath and coworkers investigated the norovirus genotype GII.7 with atomic force microscopy (AFM) in a pH range of 2\u201310 (Cuellar et al\n2010). Despite belonging to GII genogroup, VLPs were found to be sensitive to alkaline treatment. GII.7 noroviruses were reported as slowly evolving genotypes with decreasing prevalence (Hoffmann et al\n2012). Based on these and our own findings on GI.1 and emerging GII.17 viruses, it is tempting to speculate whether increased VLP stability could be related to prevalence. However, other causes cannot be excluded and genome containing viruses likely have altered stability profiles.",

            "text": "A sequence alignment of VP1 of GI.1 Norwalk and West Chester virus reveals 13 substitutions (figure S6), with seven amino acids exchanged for similar residues. Four out of the six dissimilar residues are located in the S domain (N-terminal 225 amino acids); all of them are located at the dimer surface and potentially involved in inter-dimer contacts (figure 5). Substitutions for similar amino acids are exclusively found in the P domain together with two dissimilar residues close to the intra-dimer interface and therefore unlikely to cause the differences in assembly behavior. The P domain also contains the only substitution involving charged residues (H286Q), therefore altered electrostatic interactions are an unlikely cause of the observed changes. In light of the Norwalk S domain, which assembles into T  =  3 particles like the full length protein VP1 albeit with lower stability (Baclayon et al\n2011), the amino acid exchanges in the S domain most likely cause the occurrence of the smaller West Chester T  =  1 at neutral pH. Which amino acids contribute to stability or alteration of capsid size requires further investigations by mutagenesis. Nevertheless, the quasi-equivalent B subunit shows a serine to asparagine substitution at residue 11 in the N-terminal arm, which directly interfaces with the \u03b2-sheet of subunit C. A/B and C/C dimers show a different arrangement of the S domain, bent and flat, respectively (Prasad et al\n1999). The substitution at residue 11 may alter the capability of the VP1 protein to switch to the alternate C conformation and therefore also small particles can form at neutral pH. The GI.1 Norwalk and GII.17 Kawasaki sequences are 46% identical (figure S6). The substitutions are located across the entire sequence but with higher frequency in the P domain. However, in all three variants the pI remains similar (Norwalk virus pI 5.64, West Chester isolate pI 5.57 and Kawasaki isolate pI 5.24). Given the number of substitutions, it is impossible to link the increased stability to any specific residues. Interestingly, residue 11 is not substituted in Kawasaki virus but flanked by two substitutions, S10P and V12N, which could again be an explanation for the increased T  =  1 amount compared to Norwalk virus. Again, further studies are required to pinpoint the residues responsible for the observed stability and size differences.",

The combination with negative stain EM confirmed the observed differences between norovirus-like particles of different genogroups. Notably, also isolates from the same genotype show distinct profiles and can pinpoint residues altering the assembly. The results are therefore informative for designing capsids with specific properties for nanotechnological applications (Worsdorfer et al\n2011). It is of interest to test whether ligand binding to e.g. glycans alters the stability profiles, which would be indicative of structural changes. Furthermore, if stability differences persist at the virion level, mass determination in conjunction with determination of mechanical properties from AFM or similar methods could have potential as a diagnostic tool with the capability to distinguish specific isolates. Especially for rapidly evolving RNA viruses like noroviruses, this is a promising approach to identify new variants without the need for prior knowledge.",
