            "text": "Inoculation of the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) into the CNS of susceptible strains of mice provides an excellent model in which to examine host response mechanisms responsible for both control of viral replication within distinct cell lineages present in the brain as well as host-derived factors regulating neuroinflammation (Bergmann et al., 2006). JHMV infection results in an acute encephalomyelitis characterized by wide-spread replication primarily in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with relatively few neurons being infected (Knobler et al., 1981, Buchmeier and Lane, 1999, Parra et al., 1999, Perlman et al., 1999, Bergmann et al., 2006). Control of viral replication during acute disease relies on virus-specific CD8+ T cells, which function by two different effector mechanisms within the CNS: IFN-\u03b3 secretion is responsible for controlling viral replication in oligodendrocytes whereas a perforin-dependent mechanism promotes viral clearance from astrocytes (Lin et al., 1997, Parra et al., 1999). Infiltrating CD4+ T cells provide a supporting role for the maintenance and expansion of CTLs within the CNS, as well as enhancing effector responses (Stohlman et al., 1998, Phares et al., 2012). Although a robust cell-mediated immune response occurs during acute disease, sterilizing immunity is not achieved, resulting in viral persistence (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981). Histological features associated with viral persistence include the development of an immune-mediated demyelinating disease with both T cells and macrophages being important in amplifying disease severity by contributing to myelin damage (Cheever et al., 1949, Perlman et al., 1999, Lane et al., 2000, Pewe and Perlman, 2002, Pewe et al., 2002).",

EBI3 is capable of binding subunits p28 or p35 (a subunit of IL-12) to form the cytokines IL-27 and IL-35, respectively (Collison and Vignali, 2008, Wojno and Hunter, 2012). Both IL-27 and IL-35 have important immunoregulatory roles controlling cytokine secretion and inflammation (Collison and Vignali, 2008, Yoshida and Miyazaki, 2008, Wojno and Hunter, 2012). Recent studies have highlighted that genetic ablation of EBI3 results in altered T cell-mediated cytokine expression (Yang et al., 2008) associated with increased inflammation as well as changes in the composition of the cellular infiltrate in experimental models of delayed-type hypersensitivity (Tong et al., 2010), autoimmune inflammation (Igawa et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2012), as well as hepatitis (Siebler et al., 2008). The influence of EBI3 in host defense in response to infection with a neurotropic virus has not been well characterized and was the focus of the present study.",

In brief, single cell suspensions of experimental tissues (all depleted of red blood cells) were stained with combinations of antibodies directed against the following surface markers: CD4, CD8a, CD44, CD25, CD62L, IA-IE (BD Biosciences), CD45 (eBiosciences), and F4/80 (Ab Direct). In all cases, isotype-matched control antibodies were used. Virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells recognizing their respective immunodominant epitope between amino acids 133 and 147 of the membrane (M) glycoprotein (M133\u2013147) and surface (S) glycoprotein (S510\u2013518) were determined by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining using previously described methods (Glass et al., 2002, Glass and Lane, 2003). The presence of virus-specific CD8 + T cells was also evaluated using S510\u2013518 MHC class I tetramers as previously described (Stiles et al., 2006). Frequency data are presented as the percentage of positive cells within the gated population. Total cell numbers were calculated by multiplying these values by the total number of live cells isolated.",

As shown in Fig. 2A, similar viral titers were present within the brains of both WT and EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice at day 5 p.i. By day 7 p.i., EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed elevated titers (p \u2264 0.05) compared to WT mice yet both groups of mice reduced titers below the level of detection (~ 100 PFU/g tissue) at day 12 p.i. Flow analysis of T cell infiltration into the CNS of infected animals revealed reduced (p \u2264 0.05) numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells present within the brains of infected EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice at day 5 p.i. (Fig. 2B). However, by day 7 p.i., there were increased numbers of CD8 + T cells present in the CNS of infected EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice and this was sustained out to day 12 p.i.

Further examination revealed enhanced activation (CD62L\u2212CD25+) states in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell (Fig. 2C) subsets present within the CNS of JHMV-infected EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice. Macrophage (CD45highF4/80+) infiltration, as determined by flow cytometric analysis, was elevated in infected EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice at days 7 (p \u2264 0.05) and 12 p.i.

Specifically, JHMV infection of EBI3-deficient mice increased mortality during the acute stage of the disease and this is not the result of impaired ability to control viral replication. Rather, increased disease severity was associated with enhanced leukocyte entry into the CNS with greater numbers of both CD8 + T cells and virus-specific CD8 + T cells when compared to WT mice. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 secretion was increased following viral peptide stimulation of EBI3-deficient CD4 + and CD8 + T cells isolated from JHMV-infected mice. Although IFN-\u03b3 production was elevated in CD8 + T cells, CTL activity was muted indicating differential roles for EBI3 in contributing to antiviral effector functions. These findings highlight that within the context of JHMV infection of the CNS, EBI3 is important in influencing virus-specific CD8 + T cell effector function yet the overall impact of how this contributes to increased mortality remains enigmatic and requires continued investigation.",

            "text": "Previous studies indicate that genetic ablation of EBI3 influences cytokine production by T cells. For example, delayed-type hypersensitivity is dramatically exacerbated in EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 associated with enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells into the footpad of antigen-challenged mice as compared to control animals (Tong et al., 2010). In addition, EBI3 negatively regulates T cell production of IL-17 and IL-22 and this correlated with enhanced expression of the transcription factor RORgT (Yang et al., 2008). Experimental infection of EBI3-deficient mice with Leishmania demonstrated muted Th1 responses indicating a potential role in regulating immune responses following microbial infection (Zahn et al., 2005). The majority of studies examining the importance of EBI3 in tailoring T cell responses have characterized a role within the context of IL-27 (EBI3/p28) signaling. These studies have highlighted an important role for IL-27 in modulating T cell as well as inflammatory responses. IL-27 signals through a heterodimeric receptor consisting of IL-27Ra (WX1) and gp130 (Pflanz et al., 2004). Originally characterized as a proinflammatory cytokine that was necessary for initiation of Th1 differentiation (Pflanz et al., 2002), IL-27 expression was shown to be critical in generation of protective T cell responses in response to infection with Leishmania major (Zahn et al., 2005). However, additional studies have shown that loss of IL-27 signaling through genetic ablation of either EBI3 or IL27Ra does not diminish the ability to generate a protective Th1 response (Batten and Ghilardi, 2007). Rather, animals lacking these genes have exhibited enhanced immune responses associated with accelerated tissue damage that correlates with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 following infection with Toxoplamsa gondii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Villarino et al., 2003, Holscher et al., 2005). With regard to viral infection, IL-27 has been shown to exert an anti-viral effect on HIV and evidence suggests that this is mediated, in part, by activating multiple interferon-inducible genes (Fakruddin et al., 2007, Imamichi et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Whether increased neuroinflammation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion by T cells in response to JHMV infection of the CNS is due to impaired signaling through either IL-27 or IL-35 remains to be determined. However, a recent study by Liu et al. (2012) examined the influence of EBI3 within the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune model of neuroinflammation and demyelination. Similar to our findings, there was increased neuroinflammation in MOG-immunized EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT controls and this was accompanied by increased Th1 responses (Liu et al., 2012). However, production of IFN-\u03b3 was not affected in EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice but IL-2 and IL-17 levels were dramatically elevated. Although neuroinflammation was increased in EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice with EAE, the severity of disease was only marginally enhanced compared to WT mice and this may be the result of increased numbers of CD4+Foxp3 + Treg's that exhibited potent suppressive functions (Liu et al., 2012). IL-17-producing T cells are not detected within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice so it is unlikely that the absence of EBI3 affects secretion of IL-17 in this model (Held et al., 2008, Kapil et al., 2009). Whether Tregs are increased in number and/or exhibit enhanced suppressor functions in response to JHMV infection of EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice is unknown at this time. It is interesting to speculate that a reason that the severity of demyelination is not dramatically increased in JHMV-infected EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice even in the face of increased neuroinflammation may be the result of enhanced suppressor activity by Tregs and this is currently under investigation.",

Moreover, a recent study by Stumhofer et al. (2006) has demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor responses by CD8 + T cells in EBI3 \u2212/\u2212 mice associated with increased IFN-\u03b3 production.
