Bacterial and fungal organisms accounted for over 96% of microbiologically documented infection during febrile neutropenia. Since then, research efforts have largely focused on strategies to reduce or prevent the morbidity and mortality related to infections caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens. However, the advent and clinical availability of an array of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools have afforded clinicians and researchers the opportunity to identify previously undetected viral pathogens. More recent literature has linked as many as 34% of fever and neutropenia episodes to a viral pathogen 2.

The incidence of identified respiratory viral pathogens per febrile episode ranged from 7% to 59%. The variation in frequency of identified pathogens is related to variation in the diagnostic tests utilized, the specimen type collected, and the implications for testing (screening vs. symptom guided testing). Across the three studies, the more commonly identified viral organisms included rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, influenza, and adenovirus. Less frequently HMPV, human bocavirus, and coronavirus were also identified. Although less data exist in HCT recipients, one recent prospective study showed that with surveillance PCR testing, 50% of patients receiving an allogeneic HCT have a positive test for a primary respiratory pathogen 7. The distribution of viral isolates was similar to that of children with malignancy. Among the respiratory pathogens, RSV is of particular concern for resultant mortality in high\u2010risk patients. In immunocompetent patients, RSV is often a self\u2010limiting upper respiratory infection. However, in patients with AML and HCT recipients RSV can progress to a lower respiratory tract process. In this setting RSV is associated with a 14% case fatality rate in patients with AML and a 50% case fatality rate in pediatric recipients of HCT 8, 9.",

In one survey of HCWs, 86% of those reporting a recent respiratory infection stated that they provided patient care after their symptoms had started 50. Guidelines on work restriction in this setting have been published and should be enforced 51. Finally, patient visitors, both children and adults, can serve as a reservoir for viral transmission to hospitalized children.

Although a number of vaccines are live virus vaccines and thus contraindicated in immunocompromised children, it is still important to encourage families to maintain compliance with vaccine recommendations in all close family contacts. This practice is referred to as \u201ccocooning\u201d which can help to provide protection around the more vulnerable immunocompromised patient 53. Oral poliovirus vaccine (no longer administered in the US) is the only live virus vaccine with a definitive contraindication for administration to household contacts of immunocompromised patients. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices offers the suggestion that close contacts of patients with \u201cseverely weakened immune systems being cared for in a protective environment\u201d should not receive the live attenuated nasal spray influenza vaccine (LAIV) 54, however this suggestion is not supported by published data or the biology of the vaccine. In actuality the LAIV may be superior to the trivalent inactivated vaccine in preventing the transmission of wild\u2010type influenza virus from close contacts to immunocompromised patients. In LAIV recipients local production of mucosal IgA antibodies neutralize wild type virus at its portal of entry thus limiting the potential for shedding of wild type virus. Additionally, LAIV provides some protection against circulating influenza strains not included in the vaccine. Furthermore, fear of transmission and subsequent infection from the attenuated and cold\u2010adapted vaccine virus is unfounded, as the LAIV virus cannot replicate at core body temperatures 55. Given this, it is not at all surprising that there have been no cases of documented infection from the attenuated virus in close contacts of LAIV recipients.",

Patients without a history of varicella or unknown or negative varicella serologies and receiving chemotherapy for malignancy or recipients of HCT are considered at risk for varicella infection after a true exposure. The definition of \u201ctrue\u201d exposure can be challenging but close face\u2010to\u2010face contact with someone who has chicken pox or intimate contact with someone who has herpes zoster are often considered real exposures. Passive immunoprophylaxis within 96 h should be established by administering Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin (VariZIG). VariZIG is available for routine use in Canada but in the United States it must be administered via an investigational new drug protocol from FFF Enterprises (800\u2010843\u20107477; http://www.fffenterprises.com/Products/VariZIG.aspx). If VariZIG is not available conventional intravenous immunoglobulin can be substituted. If 96 h from the time of exposure has elapsed then immunoprophylaxis will be less effective. In this setting chemoprophylaxis with acyclovir started 7\u201310 days after the exposure and continued for 7 days can be administered. Fisher et al. 74 recently reviewed the available data for the effectiveness of both of these post\u2010exposure approaches in immunocompetent and immunocompromised children. There are reasonably strong data to support the effectiveness of immunoglobulin in reducing the risk of severe disease in immunocompromised children. The data for the effectiveness of acyclovir chemoprophylaxis in immunocompromised children are limited to case reports and small case series.

            "text": "We have entered an era where advanced and commonly available diagnostic modalities have made it possible to identify the presence of many viral pathogens. This technology has helped to establish the significant impact that viral infections are having on the morbidity and mortality of children with malignancy and those receiving HCT. Despite this knowledge, there continues to be a paucity of effective interventions available to prevent or suppress these infections. Research efforts should focus on discovering novel therapies that are both effective at preventing and treating infection and that also have an attractive safety profile. However, even when effective antiviral agents or vaccines are available there is often a lack of data and consensus for best practice recommendations. Therefore, at this time, establishment of rigorous and consistent guidelines for both infection control measures and prophylactic therapies may be the most effective way to reduce the impact of viral pathogens. Such guidelines should be formally proposed, evaluated and appropriately adjusted by committees composed of experts representing the disciplines of oncology, infectious diseases, and infection control and prevention.",
