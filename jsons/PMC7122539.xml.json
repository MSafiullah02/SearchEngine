These methods rely on antigen\u2013antibody interactions, and they can be adapted to allow direct detection of the virus (antigen detection) or to identify the host\u2019s immune response to the virus infection (antibody detection). The methods are also used to identify and characterize virus isolates following in vitro or in vivo propagation. Although molecular detection is often more sensitive than antigen detection, immunological methods still have an important role in the study of the epidemiology, pathology, and assessment of clinical disease associated with viral infection.",

Isolation of a virus from a normally sterile site, such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood, is generally highly significant and usually establishes the etiology of the infection. The identification of certain viruses, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens, also is diagnostic because an asymptomatic carrier state has not been shown to exist. However, prolonged and generally asymptomatic excretion or shedding of other viruses can make the determination of the effect of a particular virus on the disease process very difficult. Viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenoviruses, and enteroviruses are shed in disease states but also may be shed asymptomatically for prolonged periods of apparent good health. An additional complicating factor is the differentiation of primary infection from reactivation of disease, a problem common to the study of infections with viruses such as herpes simplex (HSV) or CMV, especially in immunocompromised hosts such as transplant recipients or patients infected with HIV. Interpretation of laboratory results in such situations requires a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the virus.",

It was another several decades before diagnostic viral serological methods were developed, including complement fixation in the 1930s and hemagglutination inhibition in the 1940s [2]. Immunofluorescent methods for detecting virus antigen were developed in the 1950s by labeling virus-specific antibodies with a fluorescent reporter such as fluorescein isothiocyanate [3]. A little more than one decade after the initial description in 1959 of the radioimmunoassay [4] for detecting human plasma insulin, the method was adapted for virus antigen detection [5]. The radioisotope used as a reporter was replaced later during the 1970s with enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase that allowed colorimetric detection [6]. The method was also readily modified (see below) to allow detection of antibody. A further modification of immunoassay detection methods followed with the use of substrates that allowed detection of the antigen\u2013antibody interaction via measurement of a chemiluminescent reaction.",

The higher the affinity of a paratope for a corresponding epitope, the greater the strength of binding and the lower the K\nd value. A related concept is antibody avidity, which is a measure of the overall binding strength of an antibody to the corresponding antigen. Antibody avidity is correlated to its affinity, but it is also affected by the number (or valency) of interactions between the antibody and antigen. For IgG antibody, the valency is up to two. Since the antigen\u2013antibody interaction is in equilibrium, the presence of multiple binding interactions can maintain the antigen\u2013antibody complex once formed during periods of dissociation between an epitope and paratope.",

As noted above, antibody affinity and concentration are particularly important when developing an antigen detection assay. The relative concentration of antigen-specific antibody is lowest in postinfection sera. It can be increased through hyperimmunization with the antigen to generate polyclonal antisera, and the relative concentration can be increased further by affinity purification of the antibody. The highest relative concentrations are reached through the generation of monoclonal antibodies, and selection of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies for use in diagnostic assays is now widely used in the development of antigen detection assays [7].",

Many of the low-affinity interactions can be removed by washing steps, use of blocking reagents and use of lower concentrations of antibody, but each antibody used in a diagnostic assay should be evaluated for the presence of these nonspecific reactions.

Viruses that primarily cause disease at a mucosal surface or cause vesicular skin lesions generally can be identified in specimens taken from those sites. However, viruses causing generalized or congenital disease or causing symptoms in an internal organ (e.g., central nervous system) often can be identified in specimens taken from multiple different sites. Viruses that cause respiratory tract disease such as influenza viruses, RSV, and rhinoviruses are most frequently identified in samples of respiratory secretions; viruses that cause gastroenteritis, such as rotaviruses, caliciviruses, and astroviruses, are identified in fecal specimens; and viruses that cause generalized or congenital diseases, such as measles, CMV, and mumps, are identified from respiratory secretions, urine, and blood. However, antigen detection methods may not be available for some of these different sample types. Furthermore, some samples may be more likely to yield a positive sample than others (e.g., fecal specimen vs. rectal swab for rotavirus and bronchoalveolar lavage for respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients) [10, 11].

The direct IF test may offer enhanced specificity due to lower background fluorescence. The indirect IF method requires more reagents and more time to perform. Whether monoclonal or polyclonal antisera are optimal for use in either test method is still debated. The use of monoclonal antibodies generally provides the lowest background but may be limited by the high specificity of these reactions. This problem can usually be overcome by using a pool of monoclonal antibodies.",

The IF method has the advantage of allowing rapid viral diagnosis in properly obtained specimens [17\u201320]. When working with large numbers of clinical specimens, the time required for sample collection, processing, and interpretation of the stained slide becomes substantial. The enthusiasm for this technique in clinical specimens has varied due to the time and degree of technical competence required to read such samples, the availability of other, the less labor-intensive antigen detection methods, and the frequency of false-negative results obtained because of the dependence of the assay on having a high degree of viral antigen expression in the clinical sample. Nevertheless, the appropriate use of this test can result in reliable and sensitive rapid diagnosis from clinical samples. The use of IF for the detection of RSV in pediatric patients by an experienced laboratory can detect up to 90\u201395 % of the samples positive by culture [21, 22], although many laboratories report rates of 60\u201380 % [23\u201325].",

This technique, pioneered by Coons [28] in 1942, has been used to study the structure and function of a variety of viral proteins and continues to be utilized in both the research and clinical laboratories. It has been used both for detection of viral infection of a monolayer prior to the appearance of cytopathic effect and in rapid screening assays for drug resistance [29, 30]. This method utilizes reagents similar to those used in the IF assay except that the fluorescent marker is replaced by an enzyme. When enzyme-specific substrates are provided, a colored precipitate forms at the site of reaction. Typical enzymes used to detect viral antigens include alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase. A major drawback of alkaline phosphatase-based reagents is their lack of stability; a major drawback of peroxidase as a marker is the fact that this enzyme is endogenous to some mammalian tissue, thus requiring either elimination of the endogenous enzyme or use of a nonmammalian enzyme, glucose oxidase [31].",

Both direct and indirect staining with immunoperoxidase and other enzymes have been utilized to detect many viruses. Refinements have been developed that allow even greater sensitivity than that seen with indirect staining without the need to conjugate enzyme to an antibody. For example, a modification of these techniques has been a four-layer sandwich technique involving (1) virus-specific antibody raised in species X, (2) an excess amount of a second antibody raised against the species X antibody, (3) a complex of peroxidase and antiperoxidase antibody (raised in species X), and (4) reducing substrate for peroxidase [32]. The second antibody acts as a bridge, binding to both the virus and the antiperoxidase antibody. Similar unlabeled assay methods have been described for alkaline phosphatase\u2013antialkaline phosphatase and glucose oxidase\u2013antiglucose oxidase [33, 34]. The sensitivity of antigen detection has been further improved by more recently developed signal amplification methods, including avidin\u2013biotin complexes (binding of 4 biotins per streptavidin), chain polymer-conjugated technology where multiple enzyme and antibody molecules are attached to an inert molecule such as dextran, and the use of tyramine conjugates as substrates for horseradish peroxidase that allow signal amplication as much as 100-fold [35].",

Initially, the technique was developed for the determination of endogenous human plasma insulin levels [4]. The first important use of RIA in diagnostic virology was for the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen [5]. The original RIA described by Yalow and Berson [36] was a competitive binding assay in which the competition between an unlabeled antigen and a radiolabeled antigen reacting with a limited amount of antibody over a short period of time was monitored. Variations in RIA methods have been developed, with the most common being the direct and indirect solid-phase RIA. In the direct solid-phase RIA, antigen or antibody are captured on a solid support and detected by radiolabeled (usually 125I) antibody or antigen, respectively. The amount of signal increases proportionally to the amount of antigen or antibody present in the sample. In indirect assays, the capture of antigen or antibody to the solid phase prevents the binding of labeled antibody or antigen, respectively, so that the amount of signal detected is inversely proportional to the amount of antigen or antibody present. RIA methods currently are utilized mainly for the detection of antigens and antibodies of viral hepatitis [37]. The use of RIA for the detection of various hepatitis markers has demonstrated the assay\u2019s high degree of sensitivity. For the most part, RIA methods have been replaced by EIA for routine diagnostic purposes due to the complexity of the assay, the use of radioisotopes, lack of standardized commercially available reagents, and high equipment costs.",

When viral antigen is present in a specimen, it binds to the immobilized \u201ccapture\u201d antibody and a second \u201cdetecting\u201d antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase then attaches to the antigen, forming a three-layer \u201csandwich\u201d consisting of the immobilized antibody, the antigen, and the detecting antibody with enzyme attached (Fig. 3.2). A substrate specific for the enzyme is added and a color reaction occurs that can be monitored by spectrophotometry or by direct visualization. The test is quite simple to run, requiring only standardization of reagents and techniques such as dilution, incubation, and washing. The principles involved in EIA are similar to those involved in immunofluorescence and RIA, but the EIA test has the distinct advantages of being simple to perform, utilizing reagents that have long shelf lives, are inexpensive, and do not require sophisticated technical evaluation to determine results.

The clinical sample and antibody conjugated to the lanthanide is added next, and after a suitable incubation period, the unbound components are removed by washing. An enhancement solution is added and the well is exposed to the appropriate wavelength of light. A fluorometer is used to measure fluorescence for 1 s, and the pattern of fluorescence allows the separation of antigen-specific signal from background fluorescence. Several different lanthanides are available for use, but europium is frequently used because of its long fluorescence decay time and the difference between its excitation wavelength (~340\u2013360 nm) and emission wavelength (~615 nm) [8].

For many viral agents, the neutralizing antibody level is directly correlated with immunity, an important clinical and epidemiologic endpoint. Disadvantages of the assay include the time required to obtain a result and the relatively high cost, due to the labor intensity and requirement for cell culture and titered viral stocks. Neutralization assays may be carried out in a variety of systems and the endpoint measured by a number of different procedures. Different neutralization systems include plaque reduction neutralization, sometimes using complement enhancement, where the number of virus plaques in control wells are compared with the number seen in cultures inoculated with the virus\u2013serum mixture; microneutralization, an assay performed in microtiter plates requiring small amounts of sera; and colorimetric assays. Colorimetric assays rely on markers indicating metabolic inhibition of the virus in cell cultures or on antigen\u2013antibody reactions with antibody tagged or reacted with enzyme-linked antibodies. Colorimetric assays are generally analyzed by measurement of optical density and have the advantage of being less time-consuming and costly to set up and analyze than other assays.

First developed in 1909 by Wasserman and coworkers [63, 64] for the detection of syphilis antibodies, CF has been adapted to test for antibodies to many bacterial and fungal pathogens of animals and man. The CF test relies on competition between two antigen\u2013antibody systems for a fixed amount of complement, with the result ultimately demonstrated by the lysis of erythrocytes. The serum is heated at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate any complement that may be present. Antigen and a known amount of complement are added to dilutions of serum. The complexes formed between the initial antigen and antibody bind the available free complement, thus preventing further reaction of the complement in the second step of the assay. In the second step, a hemolytic indicator system using red blood cells (RBCs), which have been reacted with hemolysin to sensitize them to complement, is used to detect the free complement. The RBCs are reacted with hemolysin, or antibody to the RBC, and added to the assay. Lysis of the RBCs occurs if free complement is present. Thus, the presence of hemolysis at the conclusion of the assay is indicative of the absence of specific antibody, whereas the formation of clumped RBC (often referred to as a \u201cRBC button\u201d) indicates a positive test reaction. Antibody titers can be calculated using standard endpoint determinations. Antibodies detected by CF are primarily of the IgG class and develop during the convalescent stages of illness. The greatest application of the CF test lies in the demonstration of a rise in antibody in convalescent compared with acute sera. The CF test has been widely used for the serodiagnosis of many human viral pathogens because of its broad reactivity and effectiveness in detecting changes in antibody titers and it is often the standard against which new methods are compared. The CF test has largely been replaced in many laboratories by enzyme immunoassays, but it continues to maintain its usefulness in some circumstances because reagents are relatively inexpensive and readily available and the test is rapid, reliable, and relatively easy to perform [65]. Another advantage of this assay is that many antigens can be easily tested in the same sera samples simply by changing the antigen but keeping all other reagents and conditions the same. The CF test is also adaptable to microtiter and automated methods.",

While HAI may be used to identify an unknown virus with virus-specific antisera, it also is useful for the detection of virus-specific antibodies in the serum. HAI may be used to evaluate antibody titers of influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rubella, arboviruses, and some strains of picornaviruses and noroviruses [68, 69]. In this assay, serial dilutions of sera are allowed to react with a defined amount (4 HA units) of viral hemagglutinin. Subsequently, agglutinable RBCs are added and the ability of the virus to agglutinate the RBCs is measured. Properly treated sera containing antibody specific to the virus will prevent agglutination of the RBCs, resulting in formation of RBC buttons in the test wells; sera lacking specific antibody will result in RBC agglutination. Nonspecific viral inhibitors can give rise to false-positive results in some systems, requiring that the sera be properly prepared prior to use. The specificity of the assay varies somewhat with the particular virus, with influenza and parainfluenza virus systems being more specific than the arbovirus system [69]. For example, the HAI test can identify specific strains of influenza viruses, whereas it identifies only the group-specific antigens of the arboviruses (with neutralization tests required for strain identification). Advantages of the HAI assay are its simplicity, the low cost for reagents and equipment, and speed of the assay. Disadvantages of this assay include the fact that the system only works with those viruses that cause hemagglutination and that nonviral-specific serum components may also inhibit hemagglutination, thereby invalidating the test results.",

This methodology has replaced other methods in many laboratories in part due to the commercial availability of test materials and complete test kits. The most commonly used immunoassays employ a four-layer approach: antigen is bound directly to a surface, the unknown serum sample is then added, an enzyme-conjugated antihuman IgG or IgM is added next, and an indicator system is used to determine the amount of reaction between the enzyme-linked antibody and the antigen\u2013serum reaction. As discussed in Sect. 5.5, this method has gained widespread use due to its sensitivity, specificity, safety, simplicity, low cost, and ability to be automated. The system lends itself to automation because of readily available microtiter diagnostic systems and because multiple tests for different antigens may be run by varying only the initial antigen in the system. Clinical specimens from various sources besides serum or plasma, such as respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and breast milk, also may be tested in this system. The EIA test may also be read visually and so is useful in developing countries unable to afford the photometric reader used in developed countries to accurately quantitate the antibody content.",

The development of newer molecular assays with improved sensitivity have supplanted many antigen detection methods with lower sensitivity, but the ease of performance of the antigen detection methods still makes these assays attractive to many laboratories. While molecular methodologies offer the potential for great sensitivity and specificity, they often require specialized equipment for their performance. Ultimately, the ideal diagnostic test will be rapid, easy to perform, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific and will not require the use of specialized equipment. However, even if such a test is developed, the significance of the identified virus to the observed disease process will remain in the hands of the epidemiologist, virologist, and clinician.",
