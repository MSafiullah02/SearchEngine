Timely data on attitudes and behaviors are thus necessary to develop optimal intervention strategies and to assess the consequences of the pandemic for different demographic groups. We developed a rapid response monitoring system via a continuously run online survey (the \"COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey\") across eight countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States). The survey was specifically designed to collect key information on people's health status, behaviors, close social contacts, and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an innovative approach to recruit participants via targeted Facebook advertisement campaigns in order to generate balanced samples for post-stratification. In this paper, we present results for the period from March 13-April 19, 2020. We estimate important differences by sex: women show a substantially higher perception of threat along with a lower level of confidence in the health system. This is paralleled by sex-specific behaviors, with women more likely to adopt a wide range of preventive behaviors. We thus expect behavior to serve as a protective factor for women. Our findings also show a higher level of awareness and concern among older respondents, in line with the evidence that the elderly are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19. While across all the samples respondents were less concerned for themselves than for their country or for the world, we also observed substantial temporal and spatial heterogeneity in terms of confidence in institutions and responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions.",

By mid-April 2020, the virus had already caused over 1.6 million cases and over 100,000 deaths worldwide [2] , placing a substantial burden on national healthcare systems and posing unprecedented challenges for governments and societies. As yet, governmental responses to mitigate the coronavirus epidemic have varied considerably across countries. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, specifically intended to reduce sustained local transmission by reducing contact rates in the general population, have so far ranged from moderate containment measures, such as school closures and cancellations of public gatherings, to drastic measures, such as travel bans and nationwide lockdowns [3] . In Western democracies, individual behaviors, rather than governmental actions, are potentially crucial to control the spread of COVID-19 [4] . Human behavior is in fact a key factor in shaping the course of epidemics [5] . Individuals may spontaneously modify their behaviors and adopt preventive measures in response to an epidemic when mortality or the perception of risk is high, and this may in turn change the epidemic itself by reducing the likelihood of transmission and infection [6, 7, 8] .",

Decision-making and the evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions require specific, reliable, and timely data not only about infections, but also about human behavior. Especially in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where medical treatment and vaccination are still only remote options, mitigation and containment mainly rely on massive and rapid adoption of preventive measures [9] . Understanding how the members of different demographic groups perceive the risk, and consequently adopt specific behaviors in response to it, is therefore key to measure the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, design more realistic epidemic models, and enable public health agencies to develop optimal control policies to contain the spread of COVID-19.",

In March 2020, we launched a crossnational online survey, called the \"COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey\" (CHBS), to collect timely data on people's health status, behaviors, close social contacts, and attitudes related to COVID-19. We recruit respondents through advertisement campaigns on Facebook, that we created via the Facebook Advertising Manager (FAM). This novel approach to recruiting respondents allows us to combine the flexibility of online surveys for rapid data collection, with the controlled environment of targeted advertisement. This makes it possible to recruit a balanced sample across demographic groups, that is approximately representative of the general population, after applying appropriate post-stratification weights [10, 11, 12] . Other similar online initiatives have emerged recently [13, 14, 15, 16] , but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first cross-national study addressing multiple key factors, ranging from individual behaviors and attitudes to health-related indicators to social contact patterns. Moreover, our sampling approach and continued data collection allows us to compare people's behaviors across countries that are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess changes in behaviors after pivotal events, such as nationwide lockdowns.",

To facilitate validation and warrant comparability with existing surveys, we included standard questions from several sources, such as the European Social Survey (ESS) [17] regarding socio-demographic characteristics, Ipsos [18] regarding opinions on the coronavirus outbreak, and the Polymod project [19] regarding social contacts. Note that we ask respondents about their behavior and attitudes related to the coronavirus outbreak only if they indicated that they were aware of it. In more detail, we asked respondents how much, if at all, they had seen, read or heard about the coronavirus outbreak, with the answer options \"A great deal\", \"A fair amount\", \"Not very much\", \"Nothing at all\", and \"Prefer not to answer\".

In the United States, about 69% of adults used Facebook in 2019 [21] , with similar penetration rates in Europe, ranging from 56% in Germany to 92% in Denmark [22] . The FAM enables advertisers to create advertising campaigns that can be targeted at specific user groups, as defined by their demographic characteristics (e.g. sex and age) and a set of characteristics that Facebook infers from their behavior on the network (e.g. interests). An increasing number of studies explore the use of Facebook in demographic and health research to recruit participants for online surveys [23, 24, 25] . Two main advantages of this approach are rooted in Facebook's wide reach and the possibility to directly target members of different demographic groups. Two concerns that are often raised are that in online samples self-selection might lead to bias in results, and that online sub-populations may not be representative of the general population. However, there is increasing evidence that samples obtained from Facebook do not significantly differ from samples obtained from more traditional recruitment and sampling techniques in central demographic and psychometric characteristics, especially if post-stratification weights are applied adequately [10, 12, 26, 27] .",

We added Germany and France on March 17, Spain on March 19, the Netherlands on April 1, and Belgium on April 4, 2020.

Second, when analysing responses to a given question, we exclude respondents who chose the options \"Don't know\" or \"Prefer not to answer\". In the analysis reported here, this particularly affects the question about awareness of the coronavirus outbreak (see Section 2.1); however, as Table S2 in the Supplementary Material shows, the share of respondents to whom this applies is less than 1% across countries. Third, given that in calendar week 12 we were only able to collect a small number of completed questionnaires in Spain (less than 100), we excluded these data from our analysis as the sample size would render our analysis unreliable for this period.

Here we use population data from Eurostat (2019) [28] and the US census (2018) [29] . Specifically, for each stratum i (given by each combination of sex, age, and macro-region) in each country, we compute the fraction p i andp i of, respectively, the true population counts N i and the sample countsN i , compared to the total population i N i and the total sample size iNi . The weights w i are then defined as w i = p i /p i , thus giving less weight to groups which are over-represented (w i < 1) and more weight to groups which are under-represented (w i > 1) in the sample. We provide more details about our approach to post-stratification in Section 3 of the Supplementary Material.",

As Table 1 shows, participation by week was high in all countries, with a median number of 1,610 participants per week in Belgium, 1,490 in France, 1,646 in Germany, 1,810 in Italy, 1,743 in the Netherlands, 1,842 in Spain, 1,114 in the United Kingdom, and 2,498 in the United States.

The sex ratio is somewhat skewed towards females compared to the overall population, ranging from 63% female in Germany to 71% female in France. In terms of age, older respondents tend to be over-represented, with a median age of 48 years (IQR 31-62) in Belgium, 45 years (IQR 29-61) in France, 40 years (IQR 27-56) in Germany, 39 years (IQR 26-56) in Italy, 55 years (IQR 38-64) in the Netherlands, 49 years (IQR 36-60) in Spain, 56 years (IQR 41-65) in the United Kingdom, and 55 years (IQR 37-65) in the United States.

In this paper, we have presented insights from survey data collected through a cross-national online survey, the COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey (CHBS). The survey is ongoing, and here we presented results based on data collected during the period March 13-April 19, 2020 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In particular, Italy was the first most affected country in Europe in terms of numbers of cases and deaths, as well as the first country in Europe to implement a nationwide lockdown on March 11, 2020 .

In the United States, instead, restrictive measures were implemented at the state level, starting in California on March 19, 2020 . Notably, regarding the United Kingdom and the United States, our data collected before and after lockdown measures were implemented (considering the United States as a whole) allow to observe temporal variation in the self-reported behaviors and attitudes: the perceived threat has increased in the population, along with the adoption of social distancing measures. In the case of the United Kingdom, after the lockdown was implemented, the level of confidence in the health systems and different levels of government sharply increased, possibly reflecting discontent in the population about previously announced strategies. By contrast, the results for Germany are more difficult to interpret. In Germany, somewhat less restrictive measures were implemented on March 22, including school closures, cancellations of public gatherings, and the encouragement of social distancing. However, in contrast to the United Kingdom and the United States, for which we observe a change in the temporal trends only after the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, we find for Germany that the share of respondents who had adopted social distancing measures was already high before such measures were implemented, and did not change much after this point. Furthermore, compared to other countries, the level of confidence in the health systems and different levels of government in Germany was high from the beginning of our observation period, and has further increased since then, whereas the perceived threat of COVID-19 has decreased over time. This might be interpreted as a case of spontaneous bottom-up behavioral changes emerging from the population, following high trust in decisions and preparedness of the government. Also, of the European countries considered in this study, Germany had the third highest number of cases (about 140,000), but placed only sixth in terms of deaths (about 4,000) as of April 19, 2020 [31] , which might explain the lower perceived risk perception in the 13 .

Yet, even though the perception of threat to oneself among our respondents was comparatively low, we found that a high share of them had increased their hand hygiene. This insight renders it uncertain as to what extent behavior can be straightforwardly linked to perceptions of personal threat. Furthermore, we found that the perceived threat posed by COVID-19 is significantly higher than the perceived threat posed by seasonal influenza. One likely explanation for this is that although seasonal influenza causes regular annual epidemics worldwide [32] , the novelty and uncertainty that surround COVID-19 leads risk perception to be substantially higher.",

This is in line with the evidence that older adults are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19 [33] . By contrast, the age structure in the perceived threat to the family is less pronounced, which suggests that respondents were concerned about their family members, regardless of their own age and the perceived threat to themselves.",

First, online surveys potentially suffer from bias due to self-selection and non-representativeness of the sample. In the case of Facebook, there is increasing evidence that samples obtained from this social media network are not significantly different in central demographic and psychometric characteristics from samples obtained by more traditional recruitment and sampling techniques [12] . Furthermore, by applying post-stratification weighting, which is a standard procedure in survey research, we can correct for non-representativeness in observable characteristics (but not necessarily for self-selection based on unobservable characteristics), at least at the level of the entire sample. Ideally, in our cross-temporal comparisons, we would apply this approach at the level of the week, to warrant complete comparability of observations over time, but issues of data sparsity complicate this approach. We do not expect this to strongly affect our results, but it should be kept in mind that our weekly results might suffer from somewhat larger bias than our aggregate results.",

Taken together, the insights gained from our survey data are particularly relevant for policy makers and help design appropriate public health strategies and communication campaigns, and to design realistic epidemic models, which can account not only for the spatio-temporal spread of the infection, but also for accurate data on individual human behaviors.",
