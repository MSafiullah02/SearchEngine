Behavioural changes during the quarantine could be associated with lower risk of trauma. The decreases of sport injuries and of injuries in children during school closure seem to support this hypothesis. However, the drop of patients seeking emergency care affected all injuries, including serious ones potentially associated with vision loss. We believe that some patients may intentionally avoid urgent care rather than risking coronavirus exposure at hospitals. Anecdotal reports suggest that this is also happening for life-threatening medical emergencies such as myocardial infarction and stroke [5, 6]. Since ocular trauma is a major cause of vision loss, the importance of not delaying or avoiding treatment should be stressed to all patients to prevent ocular morbidities.",
