Pneumococcal carriage is linked to several risk factors, including age or family size [21] . While the models accounted for age, site, sex, and time period, residual confounders may exist. Pneumococci are commonly recognized as the primary etiology of pneumonia [22] . Pneumococcus vaccines have dramatically decreased the incidence of pediatric pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae in the United States [23] , but only recently been introduced in several developing and emerging countries: 138 (71%) countries had introduced PCV by December 2016 (\u22642 years ago in 20 countries). However, most countries would achieve the same coverage of PCV as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hepatitis B-polio-Hib vaccine. Therefore, preventive measures against S. pneumoniae-mainly vaccination-should be a priority. While PCV coverage was higher in controls, this study was not designed to analyze vaccine effectiveness [24] . WHO radiographic criteria for pneumonia were defined as a robust endpoint for PCV and Hib vaccine trials. This may bias our results toward bacterial causes, as viral pneumonia is less likely to present with lobar consolidation or effusion. However, we aimed to focus primarily on severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Most study sites had very low PCV vaccine coverage. Epidemiology may vary in developing countries with higher vaccination coverage; it would be useful to reassess pneumonia etiology in a few years to evaluate the impact of PCV vaccination. RSV was the main viral agent associated with pneumonia (aPAF, 18.2%); consistent with a previous meta-analysis showing that RSV causes 20% of acute lower respiratory infections [8] . RSV detection decreased with age, in accordance with recent findings in other settings with a different source population and case definition [25] . In our population, rhinovirus was significantly associated with pneumonia, with a high detection rate in controls. Rhinovirus was detected in 27% of American children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [25] . While under debate, growing evidence suggests a causal role for rhinovirus in pneumonia etiology [26] [27] [28] . Human metapneumovirus may also be important, and has been described as a common respiratory pathogen in children (particularly <1 year of age) accounting for 5%-10% of pediatric acute respiratory infection hospitalizations [29, 30] .

This approach, which seeks to control the causes of incidence, is complementary to case-centered epidemiology and may guide global preventive strategies [33] . Multivariate models were adjusted for all pathogens tested, meaning that pathogens significantly or not significantly associated with pneumonia were retained. Nonsignificant results for some microorganisms suggest a lack of power to detect weak associations, the effect of chance (ie related to study samples), or bias. Advanced molecular diagnostic tools may be useful for epidemiological purposes, though their imperfect sensitivity and specificity may induce confusion between carriage and infection and miss some true infections [34] . Some viral agents were detected in upper respiratory samples consistently more often in cases than controls at all sites, with low detection rates in controls. However, detection of other viruses or bacteria using molecular diagnostic tools contributes little to clinical management [35] . In addition, the sensitivity of a nasopharyngeal swab is likely to be higher for pneumonia cases because of larger mucous volumes due to symptoms such as coryza [34] .The main strengths of this study include prospective collection of standardized data with advanced molecular diagnostic techniques. While difficulties were encountered related to its multicultural context, this project enabled construction of a decentralized infectious disease research network in developing countries [13] . Multicentric design and inclusion of countries bearing the majority of global pneumonia burden would permit generalization of these results to other developing countries. We identified similarities in the leading pathogens across countries. Multivariate analysis accounted for baseline levels of carriage in controls and estimated the independent contribution of each pathogen. However, residual confounding might persist if the sensitivity of respiratory samples varies depending on the microorganism. Among pathogens with strong positive associations (eg, S. pneumoniae, RSV, hMPV), adjustment increased the OR, suggesting that other pathogens may be \"protective\" and simultaneously associated with index pathogen carriageor other pathogens may be a pneumonia risk with a negative association between pathogens, as described for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae [21] . Finally, despite exclusion of patients with respiratory signs from controls, analyses permitted adjustment for respiratory carriage in non-infected children.Limitations include limited power to track seasonality and differences between sites. The sample size was relatively small to estimate site-specific differences and the number of cases varied between sites, which could lead to geographical confounding. However, pooled analyses were adjusted by study site. Second, case definition was amended due to the difficulties of enrolling patients without wheezing, which could have jeopardized internal validity. However, the data remained robust in sensitivity analyses after successively excluding individual sites or cases with wheezing. Sensitivity analysis after exclusion of cases with prehospital antibiotic exposure suggests that the importance of S. pneumoniae and RSV in pneumonia might be underestimated and that of rhinovirus overestimated. Seasonal enrollment discrepancies were observed at some sites; although the multivariate models were adjusted for this potential limitation, residual cofounding might persist. Publication of the large Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study will help assess the validity and causality of both studies [36] . In addition, a possible higher detection rate of bacteria-principally S. pneumoniae but possibly other microorganisms-in patients with coryza would lead to misclassification bias regarding this bacterium. Indeed, it may be easier to identify nucleic acid if the respiratory sample is voluminous. Finally, although causality is difficult to approach, our results are consistent with other estimations [1, 2] .In this pre-PCV population of children <5 years old from developing and emerging countries, almost half of pneumonia cases may be attributable to S. pneumoniae. Major viruses associated with pneumonia were RSV, rhinovirus, and hMPV. Additional longitudinal studies could test for larger numbers of bacteria and account for the poor sensitivity of blood cultures. While increased S. pneumoniae vaccination coverage would substantially reduce pneumonia burden in developing and emerging countries, other therapeutic measures should be considered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 201, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 737, "end": 741, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1031, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1199, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1524, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2386, "end": 2390, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3665, "end": 3669, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4072, "end": 4075, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 4076, "end": 4078, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.
