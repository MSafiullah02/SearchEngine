Typically, HAdV\u2010B species (types 3, 7, 12, 14, and 55), HAdV\u2010C (types 1, 2, 5, and 6), and HAdV\u2010E (type 4) are closely associated with respiratory tract infections [Metzger et al., 2007; Kajon et al., 2010; Walsh et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2013]. Identification of serotypes is important because the pathogenesis of HAdV infection is determined mainly by serotypes. Based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the hypervariable region in the hexon gene, phylogenetic analysis has been used for the clustering and typing of HAdVs [Crawford\u2010Miksza and Schnurr, 1996a; Biere and Schweiger, 2010]. Accordingly, phylogenetic analysis can facilitate molecular epidemiological investigations of HAdV outbreaks.",

Repeated outbreaks of such diseases have been reported worldwide [Ryan et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2008]. In the same context, respiratory HAdV infections can be identified from patients with an upper respiratory tract infection throughout the entire year, with an average detection rate of 4% in Korea [Lee et al., 2010]. However, in 2010\u2014after a major H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009\u2014an outbreak of HAdV infections occurred in Korea. This study aimed to identify the major type of HAdV involved through direct PCR amplification followed by hexon gene sequence analysis. The public health impact based on clinical features of the outbreak is also emphasized. This is believed to be the first report of a nationwide outbreak of respiratory adenovirus infections in Korea.",

Specimens were placed in virus transport medium (BD, Sparks, MD) and sent to 17 local institutes of health and environmental research maintained at 4\u00b0C to be tested for major respiratory viruses including HAdVs.

To compare any difference in HAdV prevalence between the pre\u2010 and post\u2010pandemic phases, 91 samples of nasal aspirates taken in 2008 before the H1N1 influenza pandemic were collected through the acute respiratory infection network.

Nevertheless, several symptoms associated with HAdV\u20103 infection such as nasal congestion, runny nose, and coughing were fewer in 2010 when compared with 2008 (P < 0.001). Because little is known about the association between disease severity and the virulence\u2010determining factors of HAdV, it is unclear whether these reduced clinical symptoms arose from a particular change in virulence.",

The strategy of serotype analysis used in this study was also based on a hexon gene sequence and allowed basic molecular biological information on circulating HAdVs to be obtained. Even though HAdVs have DNA as their genetic material, recombination is very frequently reported for this virus, which could be important for HAdV evolution resulting in shifts in its pathology and virulence [Craford\u2010Miksza and Schnurr, 1996b; Walsh et al., 2009; Rebelo\u2010de\u2010Andrade et al., 2010]. One recent report indicated that recombinant HAdVs introduced into the community could produce highly virulent strains with epidemic and lethal potential [Halstead et al., 2010]. Therefore, there might be a limit to explaining the relationship between clinical manifestations and HAdV infections through PCR\u2010based molecular typing targeting just one gene. It would be better to use two or more genomic point comparisons for serotype determination to obtain better evidence for the pathogenicity and disease severity of particular serotypes of HAdVs.",

            "text": "The unusually high incidence of HAdV\u20103 in 2010 following a pandemic of influenza (H1N1) in 2009 might have had several causes. One possibility is there was a micro\u2010environmental change in hosts following the pandemic era. As presented in this study, the outbreak caused by HAdV\u20103 following the pandemic era seemed not to be associated with specific changes in the viral hexon gene, which is known to encode major antigenic sites of HAdV. Instead, extensive changes in the overall host population's immune status resulting from the primary introduction of H1N1 influenza into the community could have mediated this unusually high incidence of HAdV. There was no significant changes were observed in the HAdV genome supports this hypothesis. The other possibility is that the original introduction of HAdV could lead to fluctuations in population immunity triennially, regardless of the influence of the influenza pandemic. During the preparation of this manuscript, repetitive HAdV outbreaks caused by HAdV\u20103 were also detected in 2013 (data not shown). Again, no significant mutations were observed using hexon sequence analysis targeting randomly sampled HAdV\u20103 viruses. This repetitive outbreak caused by the HAdV\u20103 suggests that when HAdV\u20103 was the major circulating virus, population immunity might have been diluted. Thus, newborn infants might be a newly susceptible group to HAdV\u20103 and this might have contributed to the triennial outbreak of HAdV\u20103 infection. To validate this hypothesis, a birth cohort\u2010derived seroepidemiological study targeting specific antibodies against HAdVs should be carried out to test the present data further.",
