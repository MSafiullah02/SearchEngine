Progress of this devastating outbreak of bubonic plague was limited by 14th century travel networks to an average daily dispersion of approximately 1.5 km [1]. In frightening contrast, the recent Zika outbreak in South America was found to spread with an average daily dispersion of 42 km, rising as high as 634 km in the most densely populated parts of Brazil [2]. This extraordinary difference is indicative of a mobile society that is no longer rigidly bound by spatial structure, making the relevant notion of distance network based rather than geographic. Similarly, in the highly connected domain of social media, the spread of concepts, memes, and hashtags can be explosive. One recent empirical study of the dynamics of online rumour cascades\u2014often reaching tens of thousands of users in a matter of days\u2014made the worrying finding that false information spreads faster than true [3]. It takes little imagination to see how an understanding of propagation speeds in modern networks would have, in the digital case, great commercial and political benefit and, in the physical case, be invaluable in planning outbreak prevention, monitoring, and response.",

One approach to the problem of spreading speed is through numerical simulations (see, e.g., [8]), which yield useful results on small scales but, for increasingly large complex networks, may prove slow and impractical. Alternative approximations have been made by considering only the most probable path between a given target node and the source [9]. It is known that this shortest-path approach can significantly overestimate the infection arrival times [10], but to take into account all possible paths would soon be infeasible because their numbers typically grow exponentially with the number of vertices in the network. One promising idea is a conjectured connection between centrality measures and infection arrival time [11], which so far has only been tested numerically.",

Exploitation of this sparse network structure has been a key tool in network epidemiology: in particular, via the message-passing approach pioneered in [12]. This technique has allowed for efficient characterization of the epidemic (percolation) threshold [13,14], and it gave rise to the new notion of non-backtracking centrality [15]. In [16,17], a message-passing approach was used to make individualized predictions for node responses to spreading processes, giving a physical interpretation of non-backtracking centrality as the probability for a node to appear in the percolating cluster. None of these works has yet addressed the important questions of how fast an epidemic will spread in a given network and which nodes may fall victim first.",

We finish by observing that the time for the infection to spread through the bulk of the network is independent of network size, implying an almost instantaneous jump from a low to a high density of infection when time is properly scaled; a property that we show to be common to time-ordered percolation in general.",

Viewing F\u02dc as a vector with entries indexed by directed edges, Eq.

Thus, for large n, we can expect F\u02dci\u2192jn(k)\u221dvi\u2192je-\u03c9(k)n,(5)where the coefficient vi\u2192j contains the edge-specific information, and the function \u03c9(k) determines the overall exponential growth rate. Substituting this ansatz into Eq. (4), we find v=f\u02dc(k)e\u03c9(k)Bv, where B is the non-backtracking matrix [15]. This is an eigenvalue equation for B with a non-negative eigenvector v; according to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, for a connected network, there is a unique maximum eigenvalue \u03bb, which is real and positive. Thus, the growth rate is found as \u03c9(k)=-log[\u03bbf\u02dc(k)]. Note that 1/\u03bb=\u03c1c is the percolation threshold of the network [13,16,17].",

One might expect the time delay \u03c4 to be scaled by the mean delay time; but, beyond this, it is difficult to discern from Eq. (6) how the shape of the distribution should affect the global speed of spread. To explore this aspect, we show in Fig. 3 the observed and predicted spreading speeds for Weibull distributed delays, interpolating between heavy tailed and Dirac distributed. Crucially, we find that the shape of the distribution of the transmission time has a substantial effect on the speed of spread in a network. If there is mass near zero, then delays are minimal due to the presence of extremely fast transmission routes. Conversely, if the transmission time is close to deterministic, then spreading is determined entirely by graph distance, meaning \u03c4\u22481. In the Supplemental Material [18], we prove that \u03c4 is always less than the mean delay time, with equality only for Dirac-delta distributions.",

Remarkably, the log-linear relationship derived above continues to hold in this more complex setting, as illustrated in Fig. 4. In addition to this visual demonstration, we present in Table I the Pearson correlation coefficients between log-non-backtracking centrality and the infection arrival time for various disease dynamics in various networks.

Taken together, these results imply that, on the timescale of the spreading contagion in a large network, one will observe an almost instantaneous jump between a vanishing fraction of nodes infected to almost complete infection. We illustrate this result in Fig. 5 for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs of increasing size, and we provide precise theoretical derivations in the Supplemental Material [18], where we show that this property holds for models of temporal percolation in both sparse and dense networks.",
