There has not been any systematic empirical study of the dynamics of emerging coordination behaviour and knowledge transfer process during a disease outbreak. In this paper, we first introduce our approach for the analysis of multi-agency intervention during a disease outbreak using the study of social networks. Using social networks and its analytic framework, we explore questions such as: How does the multi-agency coordination emerge for supporting the complex knowledge transfer process during different phases of disease outbreak? How effective are these formal and informal coordination mechanisms in achieving a robust outcome in response coordination through effective knowledge transfer process during the outbreak? What are the key lessons learned by studying the emerging coordination and knowledge transfer process during past disease outbreak in improving the multi-agency preparedness for dealing with future outbreaks? The discussion is supported by a qualitative study of the implementation of the results of the analysis. We reveal that profound understanding of social network behaviour and emerging coordination concepts are pivotal to the optimisation of knowledge transfer process which is a prerequisite for successful outbreak intervention. We look qualitatively at how Hunter New England Area Health Services applied these concepts to lead a successful coordination plan during an H1N109 endemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Disaster management is inherently complex due to the interdependent nature of the responses from multiple organisations that have responsibility for dealing with the situation collectively (Comfort et al, 2001) .

Taking into consideration that demographics are similar and pathogen is the same, then management and coordination of the response to the outbreak is one factor affecting the infection rate. This effort is led by the corresponding agencies in each individual state and area health services within the states. Usually, outbreak detection and intervention plans standardise each type of outbreak according to disease type. Hence, researchers and epidemiologists prepare tuberculosis plans, influenza plans and so on. By contrast, coordination of the multi-agency response is left to public health officials with very little academic research to support their decisions (Comfort et al, 2004; Dawes & Government, 2004; Shen & Shaw, 2004; Chen et al, 2008) . As a result, there are discrepancies in the application of resources, which will impact on infection rates and may partially explain the variation in the rates shown in Tables 1 and 2. Successful intervention is a direct consequence of successful coordination. It is the coordination effort that brings together different types of resources such as information, expertise, and supplies (Chandler, 1973) for the most efficient intervention plan. Coordination is also based on building a common understanding about the task in hand. In this paper, we use measures from social network theory to better understand the dynamics of inter-organisational coordination during disease outbreaks and how this leads to collective decentralised knowledge sharing. We collect disease outbreak coordination data from Hunter New England Area Health Services (HNEAHS) in NSW, Australia for demonstrating the effectiveness of these network-based measures to accomplish an effective coordination and communication plan that will contribute to the reduction of infected cases and transmission rates.

In its simplest conceptualisation, coordination brings the activities of many disciplines or organisations together to achieve desired goals. It describes both processes and the goals (Chisholm, 1992) and is particularly challenging where the chains of interaction are complex and long.

The two concepts are linked because communication can be regarded as a necessary and sufficient precedent associated with coordination.

Therefore, the coordination structure for disease outbreaks cannot be modelled or analysed using current standard and static coordination methods that focus on market theory proposed by Malone & Crowston. The concept of dynamic emerging coordination (Comfort et al, 2001 ) is seen to be better suited to model the inter-organisational communication where agencies have a tendency to establish, drop, and enhance communication links over time in order to achieve the optimal coordination scheme.

Using this modelling approach, a node represents an entity (organisation, agent), and the links represent communication channels. These channels can be unidirectional (oneway communication -push or feed communication) or bidirectional (two-way communication). Modelling emergent coordination as a network structure can be beneficial as it can incorporate the dynamism of the process of emergence. This is represented by re-configuring the nodes based on their new contexts, which are determined by updated communication links.

However, it is practically impossible for a single agency to collect all the data. There will be many agencies gathering information, each following its own protocols under its own jurisdiction. The coordination of the information collection effort and the assessment and optimal investment of this information complete the data collection circle. Disease monitoring systems must be adaptive according to different criteria: Intensive care units (ICUs) for example usually have a limited number of beds and nurses, as well as a strict nurse to bed ratio. Also the ICUs' surge capacity is limited and can only add a small number of beds or personnel. Resources such as these need a 'lead monitor' that will quickly flag the number of cases that are using, or will use, this resource. This will enable the organisation to operate within their capacity or coordinate with other organisations to receive overflow cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Local inbound case definition communication"}, {"text": "The monitoring system needs to be distributed geographically and functionally in order to capture cases at early signs of development.

They aggregated the lag monitors, which require less attention than the lead ones, to the Public Health Emergency Operation Centre.

In this scenario, the HSFAC sacrificed the higher degree of centrality and betweenness, which would have meant a connection to every single node (star network).

As discussed in the communication section, this information was pushed to each group rather than creating a central knowledge base (KB) and relying on their willingness to access and use it. This also enabled tailoring the pushed information to these groups based on their general needs, as well as scheduling the information updates periodically according to each group requirement rather than tying them all to a one-bit-one-time scenario.
