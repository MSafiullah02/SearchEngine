            "text": "There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure development is contingent on the availability of robust, scalable, and readily deployable surrogate viral assays to screen antiviral humoral responses, and define correlates of immune protection, and to down-select candidate antivirals. Here, we describe a highly infectious recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S as its sole entry glycoprotein that closely resembles the authentic agent in its entry-related properties. We show that the neutralizing activities of a large panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera can be assessed in high-throughput fluorescent reporter assay with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S and that neutralization of the rVSV and authentic SARS-CoV-2 by spikespecific antibodies in these antisera is highly correlated. Our findings underscore the utility of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S for the development of spike-specific vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of viral entry and its inhibition.",

Given limited access to biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) containment facilities required to safely handle SARS-CoV-2, researchers have turned to surrogate viral systems that afford studies of cell entry at biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) and facilitate rapid inhibitor screening through the use of fluorescence or luminescence-based reporters. These include retroviruses, lentiviruses, or vesiculoviruses 'pseudotyped' with SARS-CoV-2 S and competent for a single round of viral entry and infection Nie et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Pu et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) . However, these single-cycle pseudotyped viruses are typically laborious to produce and challenging to scale up, yield poorly infectious preparations, and suffer background issues in some cases due to contamination with viral particles bearing the orthologous entry glycoprotein (e.g., low levels of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing VSV G).",

Pretreatment of cells with NH 4 Cl, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, reduced entry by rVSVs bearing SARS-CoV-2 S or the Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GP) in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . However, S-mediated entry was comparatively less sensitive to NH 4 Cl than that by EBOV GP ( Fig. 2A ). Next, we tested cysteine cathepsin inhibitors E-64 ( Fig. 2B ) and FYdmk ( Fig 2C) . Pre-treatment of cells with both of these compounds also inhibited S-mediated entry, albeit with reduced sensitivity relative to that observed for EBOV GP-dependent entry ( Fig. 2B -C). Together, these findings confirm that rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S resembles the authentic agent in its requirements for endosomal acid pH and cysteine cathepsins. They also suggest a reduced dependence on these host factors for entry by SARS-CoV-2 S relative to EBOV GP, a model glycoprotein known to fuse in late endo/lysosomal compartments following extensive endosomal proteolytic processing.",

In this regard, it is tempting to speculate that one or more additional S glycoprotein mutations detected in the passage 5 and 9 viral populations and in the six plaque isolates (Table S1 ) arose as compensatory changes to suppress the syncytiogenic propensity of the rVSV-encoded S\u220621 glycoprotein spikes. Indeed, several mutations in the S1 NTD and RBD may serve to modulate spike glycoprotein fusogenicity, as also may mutations at the S1-S2 and S2' cleavage sites (R685G and P812R, respectively) (Table S1 ). Further, at least one mutation (H655Y), present in five of six rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S plaque isolates, has arisen during natural SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans , during transmission studies in a hamster model , and possibly during SARS-CoV-2 passage in tissue culture (this report). Our current efforts are aimed at understanding what role(s) these mutations in the S glycoprotein ectodomain play in the maintenance of high levels of rVSV infectivity without the formation of large numbers of syncytia. These findings also highlight a feature of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 S not shared by any of the viral entry surrogates described to date-its utility for forward genetics. This can be used to dissect structure-function relationships in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and to elucidate the mechanisms of action of spike-or entry-targeted antivirals.",

We have exploited the fidelity and high throughput of our rVSV-based 384-well plate microneutralization assay to rapidly pre-screen >300 COVID-19 convalescents and identify potential convalescent plasma donors first for the expanded access program and now for an ongoing randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma therapy (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2020 ; Clinical Trial -NYU/AECOM, 2020; Chandran & Pirofski, manuscript in preparation). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues apace and the development of plasma-, hyperimmune globulin-, mAb-, and small molecule-based countermeasures accelerates, the need for highly scalable surrogate viral assays continues to mount. The availability of a highly infectious rVSV surrogate that can be scaled up with relative ease to produce standardized batches for antiviral screening and readily deployed in reporterbased microneutralization assays will facilitate these efforts.",

Supernatants from the transfected cells were transferred to Huh7.5.1 cells every day (day 2-7 post-transfection) till the appearance of eGFP-positive cells.

The cytoplasmic tails of the S glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly similar and carry signals for their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including a conserved K\u00d7H\u00d7\u00d7 motif located near the C-terminus (McBride et al. 2007; Ujike et al. 2016). 18-19-amino acid deletions in the cytoplasmic tails of SARS-CoV S (Fukushi et al. 2005; Fukushi et al. 2006) and SARS-CoV-2 S (Ou et al. 2020) have been shown to increase the infectivity of single-cycle VSV-S pseudotypes. As previously observed for ER/Golgi-localizing hantavirus glycoproteins (Slough et al. 2019), these deletions likely redistribute S glycoproteins to the cell surface, thereby relieving the spatial mismatch in budding between VSV and SARS-CoV2 (plasma membrane vs. ER, respectively) and enhancing S incorporation into VSV particles.",
