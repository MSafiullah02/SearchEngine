            "text": "Glycoproteins and glycolipids are major components of eukaryotic cell membranes. Although their biological or physiological functions are known in some cases, the specific biological function of the glycan chains starts to be defined (Pilatte et al., 1993, Varki, 1993). Glycosylation as a covalent modification of proteins is highly diverse and, in many cases, this diversity has been shown to be species, tissue, and cell specific (Lis and Sharon, 1993). Sialic acid is part of a family of nine-carbon carboxylated sugars usually found at the outermost units of vertebrate oligosaccharides, the most common being 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), which could be considered as the precursor for almost all others. Additional diversity in sialic acids is generated by the glycosidic linkage at carbon 2, resulting, in most animals, in Neu5Ac\u03b12,3 or 2,6 linkages with the hydroxyl groups of galactose (Gal), N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) or N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues (Schauer and Kamerling, 1997). Lectins, due to their high specificity for carbohydrates of defined structures, have been used in cytochemical and histochemical studies to identify modifications of glycosylation (Alroy et al., 1987, Damjanov, 1987). These studies support the notion that regulated glycosylation is important for cell-to-cell interactions during development and growth (Suzuki et al., 1995). In addition, the use of lectins has led to identify abnormal glycosylation in mammalian tissues under pathological conditions (Ito et al., 1996, Roth et al., 1996). Presence or prevalence of specific saccharidic sequences has been considered indicators of maturity or cell transformation, e.g. the Thomsen\u2013Friedenreich (T and Tn) antigens (Gal\u03b21,3GalNAc\u03b11-0-Ser/Thr and GalNAc\u03b11-0-Ser/Thr, respectively) have been identified as specific structures for immature or transformed cells. Substitution of these antigens with Neu5Ac, forming the cryptic equivalent forms, represents the developmental or activated state of the T- and Tn-containing structures or cells. T and Tn antigens are highly expressed in different organs during fetal life; they have been also detected in most carcinomas, therefore it has been proposed that they represent general carcinoma antigens (Hanisch and Baldus, 1997).",

            "text": "Glycans have been selected by several virus as the preferred attachment sites on their host cells and tissues. Host range, tissue tropism and target cell specificity demonstrated by a particular virus are determined, at least in part, by a stereochemical fit between viral lectins and complementary carbohydrate receptors on host cell surfaces (Lis and Sharon, 1993). In pigs, the pathogenic effect of viruses, such as influenza virus (Kilbourne et al., 1988), coronavirus (Schultze et al., 1996), rotavirus (Rolsma et al., 1998) and rubulavirus (Reyes-Leyva et al., 1993, Reyes-Leyva et al., 1997) depends on a positive organotropism, which is determined by specific interactions between sialic acid-expressing cells and viral adhesion proteins. In general, the infectivity patterns of porcine viruses change with the host maturation stage. For example, rubulavirus induces neurological and respiratory pathologies in newborn and suckling pigs, whereas in adult pigs, it lacks its neurotropism and induces lesions in reproductive tissues (Ramirez et al., 1997). On the base of these findings, we have hypothesized that age-related changes in virus tropism are due to modifications in the tissular expression of sialic acids. The purpose of this study was to use several lectins with well-known sugar specificity, to identify the differences in the sialylation pattern between newborn and adult pigs.",

Indeed, a notable decrease in Neu5Ac\u03b12,3Gal expression was found in ten of the 18 CNS tissues examined; however, it was more important in structures involved in olfactory perception, i.e. olfactory nerve, bulb and tract; and piriform lobe brain cortex, which did not express Neu5Ac\u03b12,3Gal moieties at all (Fig. 1A), although staining with LPA and MAA increased in medulla oblongata and dispersed positive cells were now identified in the cervical spinal cord. The other most important change was the identification of Neu5Ac\u03b12,6Gal/GalNAc residues in adult olfactory structures and brain cortex, which were totally absent in the newborn ones. Other nervous tissues also showed a marked increase in this sialic acid derivative. In general, Neu5Ac\u03b12,6Gal over expression paralleled Neu5Ac\u03b12,3Gal downregulation (Table 1). Expression of Neu5,9Ac2 also increased with CNS maturation. This acetylated sialic acid was now observed in all regions of the brain cortex, pons and medulla oblongata, as well as in the lateral fascicles of spinal cord regions. In other tissues, such as cerebellum and olfactory bulb, the staining intensity also increased. MRL staining disappeared in mature midbrain, thalamus and hippocampus. It is important to note that brain cortex maturation involved the new expression of both Neu5Ac\u03b12,6Gal and Neu5,9Ac2 molecules. Expression of terminal Gal/GalNAc residues (T and Tn antigens) also increased in mature CNS tissues, this change was observed in several nervous tissues, but was more notable in structures forming the encephalic trunk (Table 2).",

            "text": "In this study, we performed a screening of sialylated structures in newborn and adult porcine organs to identify the possible role of maturation as determinant of the rate and type of sialylation. As our results indicate, the most evident modifications on sialylation occurred in the nervous system. The terminal position of sialic acid residues on animal glycoconjugates makes of them critical components of ligands recognized by a variety of animal, plant and microbial lectins (Sharon and Lis, 1997). The lectin from L. polyphemus recognizes sialic acid irrespective of the glycosidic linkage (Marchialonis and Edelman, 1968); for this reason, its recognition pattern, in pigs, is not modified in most of the organs tested. However, recognition of M. amurensis (specific for Neu5Ac\u03b12,3Gal) (Konami et al., 1994) and S. nigra fraction I (specific for Neu5Ac\u03b12,6Gal/GalNAc) (Shibuya et al., 1987) lectins is modified by the maturation process. Neu5Ac\u03b12,3Gal is preferentially identified in neonatal nervous system and adult genital organs, whereas Neu5Ac\u03b12,6Gal appear to be more prevalent in adult nervous tissues. Another modification of sialic acid is its 9-O-acetylation, which is specifically recognized by MRL (V\u00e1zquez et al., 1993). Although Neu5,9Ac2 was expressed at low levels in newborn pigs, it showed a broad distribution in diverse neonatal organs, but most of them became MRL negative after maturation; except for nervous tissues that increase their Neu5,9Ac2 expression. Neu5,9Ac2 occurred only in particular regions of neonatal thymus medulla and germinal centers of lymphonodi. Several studies have shown that 9-O-acetylation is commonly seen in cells of neuroectodermal origin and seems to play a role in the migration of developing neurons in the embryonic brain (Blum and Barnstable, 1987), and in the organization and growth of cones and neurites (Araujo et al., 1997). It has been shown that the concentration of Neu5,9Ac2 residues in CD4+ T lymphocytes is modified during activation and maturation processes (Krishna and Varki, 1997). In the porcine lymphatic system, this sugar residue was identified in cells from spleen, lymph node and tonsils from adult organisms, confirming that memory lymphocyte subsets present in germinal centers possess Neu5,9Ac2.",

These antigens showed attenuated levels of expression in other adult organ systems, including genitourinary and lymphoid. This suggests that these antigens may exist in a cryptic sialylated form in most organ systems in adult pig. A. leucocarpus lectin has been used to identify murine and human lymphocytes in the late stages of maturation and its interaction with the GalNAc moiety is not modified by the presence of sialic acid (Zenteno et al., 1992, Lascurain et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Sialic acids occur at terminal positions of the carbohydrate groups of glycoproteins and glycolipids, the transfer of sialic acids from CMP-NeuAc to these positions is catalyzed by a family of sialyltransferases (Harduin-Lepers et al., 1995). Changes in the expression of sialyltransferases have been previously described during maturation of cells as well as during development. As an example, during weaning, the epithelium of the mammalian small intestine undergoes a glycoform switch from predominantly sialylated glycoconjugates to those expressing fucose at their termini. Developmental regulation of \u03b2-galactoside \u03b12,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I; EC 2.4.99.1) in rat small intestine epithelium has been reported (Vertino-Bell et al., 1994). Induction of ST6Gal I by glucocorticoids in suckling rat small intestine has also been reported (Kolinska et al., 1996, Hamr et al., 1997). Furthermore, evidence for the regulated expression of the Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc \u03b12,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal I; EC 2.4.99.4) in developing thymocytes has been presented (Gillespie et al., 1993). Cortical regions of the thymus composed of immature thymocytes show low levels of ST3Gal I mRNA, whereas medullary regions of the thymus composed of mature thymocytes overexpress the enzyme. The relevance of the modifications in the sialylation process is not yet well known; however, it is necessary to assume that sialic acids could participate not only as targets for specific pathogens, but as important molecules in the regulation of the immune system (Pereira et al., 1976). However, the possibility that a specific modification of the porcine sialyltransferase activity could be modulated during maturation by sexual steroids cannot be ruled out (Vandamme et al., 1993, Hamr et al., 1997).",
