In LBSNs, users can share their experiences and tips for Point-of-Interests (POIs) [2], e.g., restaurants and sightseeing sites, in the form of check-ins [14]. The rapid growth of LBSNs has attracted billions of users, promoting our urban experience to a new stage [17]. To benefit LBSN users and promote location-based marketing, POI recommendation on LBSNs has become an essential task aiming to recommend new POIs to a user according to his personal preferences and to facilitate his exploration of the city [18].",

First, locations of POIs are important factors for POI recommendations, since users prefer to visit POIs that are not far away. For example, in Gowalla and Foursquare, 90% of users\u2019 consecutive check-ins are within the distance less than 50km [15]. Second, users\u2019 preference over POIs exhibit salient temporal periodic patterns, e.g., restaurants are preferred in dinner time and theaters are visited more frequently in weekend than in weekdays. Finally, a user\u2019s check-in records form a POI sequence with continuous distance and time intervals, offering various sequential patterns [12], e.g., POIs planned in a trip. In sum, users\u2019 check-in records contain rich spatial-temporal context information that should be synthetically integrated to reflect the dynamics of the underlying check-in system.",

However, these methods only partially leverage the spatial context and temporal context, and they integrate these contexts using a global weighting scheme [9, 19, 25], assuming that the importance of each context is unchanged for all POIs. These methods fail to capture the dynamic role of context, given that the importance of each context is POI-specific. Let\u2019s say we are going to make POI recommendation to a big foodie at 3 p.m. We may push a restaurant to him considering his long-term preference as a foodie. However, recommending a restaurant must happen at the right time, e.g., dinner time, rather than 3 p.m, at which restaurant cannot meet the user\u2019s current needs. In this scenario where restaurant is a candidate POI, we should inhibit the importance of user\u2019s long-term preference and let the temporal context play a more decisive role in user\u2019s check-in choice. That is to say, each context\u2019s importance to current recommendation should be POI-specific.",

For spatial context, due to the lack of location information of user, we infer the spatial context by exploiting users\u2019 check-in records, obtaining a low-dimensional representation through an attention enhanced recurrent neural network. Finally, a POI-guided attention mechanism is adopted to learn the importance of each context for each recommendation, offering high flexibility to capture the dynamic nature of context.",
