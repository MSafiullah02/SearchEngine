Functional communication is defined as a behavior that is directed to another person who in turn provides either direct or social rewards. Nine critical communication skills will be described. These skills are critical because, if children cannot calmly and effectively engage in each skill, then they will most likely try other means to obtain the same outcome. Typically, these other means are challenging-crying, fussing, shouting, hitting, and so on. We have identified nine such skills, of which some are skills to be used as a speaker and some are to be used as a listener, as outlined in Table 1 .",

For example, Mary enjoys eating vanilla pudding but does so only with a spoon, never with her fingers. It is fair to say that she likes pudding, but it would be unusual Transitioning (going from one activity to another) Asking for a break Following directions (spoken and/or visual instructions) Accepting (\"Yes!\") Following a schedule Rejecting (\"No!\") to declare that she likes spoons. Mary does not have a collection of spoons, and when asked to name things she likes or enjoys, she never mentions spoons. Therefore, parents are advised to list both things their children like and things they may need within a context. Furthermore, many traditional approaches to preference assessment attempt to compare individually offered items for the purpose of ranking them within a hierarchy. Although it may be true that a child prefers a ball in comparison to a napkin, this strategy places too much emphasis on individually presented rewards as opposed to combinations. Simply put, imagine how most children would respond if asked, \"Do you want peanut butter or jelly?\" Adults rarely simply order coffee from a barista. Therefore, parents are advised to investigate combinations of items or activities in order to enhance their effectiveness: cookies and milk, french fries and ketchup, music and dancing, and so on.",

Some transitions involve changes from activities that are highly rewarding to those that are less rewarding-and no one looks forward to leaving pleasant activities. Some children become upset even when they are asked to change from a less rewarding activity to one that is more rewarding.
