Identification of which disaster relief workers may be at risk of experiencing psychological distress or mental health disorders is frequently carried out through preemployment or pre-deployment psychological screening. The primary objective of our review was to assess the evidence for pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening of relief workers who work in disaster situations. We aimed to identify specific pre-employment and pre-deployment characteristics that predict impaired wellbeing of an individual following engaging in disaster-related work. Methods: A combined list of search terms was composed relating to disaster-related occupations, screening methods, psychological disorders, and study design. The databases used were PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GlobalHealth. We included studies that used cross-sectional or longitudinal study designs; were published in the English language in peer-reviewed academic journals; reported on the association between pre-employment and pre-deployment features and post-deployment psychological disorders or distress; considered any occupational groups responding to a specified, discrete crisis; and used at least one validated measure of distress or disorder. We extracted data on the author; year of publication; disaster description; country of study; study design; population sample; disorder(s) outcome and the measures used; and results. Results: Sixty-two, high-quality studies were included in the review. Forty-one potential predictors were identified. Of these, only volunteer status and previous history of mental illness and life stressors emerged as reliable predictors of distress or disorder. Conclusion: The results suggest that whilst it is attractive to screen for pre-employment and pre-deployment indicators of resilience, the evidence base for doing so is weak. At best, this sort of screening can only weakly suggest vulnerability and at worst may result in discrimination. Until better evidence about its usefulness becomes available, employers should exercise caution over its use.

Disaster relief workers include professionals such as firefighters, police, search-and-rescue and relief teams, and medical personnel alongside volunteer relief workers with no formal training. Previous research has identified that the rates of PTSD amongst these populations range from 8 to 25% [7] [8] [9] . Whilst these figures underline the risk associated with relief work, they also indicate that only a minority of traumaexposed workers develop psychological distress and illness [10] . This raises the question of whether it is possible to predict which individuals will be susceptible to psychological distress or disorder following the trauma exposure that can occur in disaster relief work.",

Those identified as being vulnerable may be prevented from taking up a disaster worker role, be more closely monitored during their work or be restricted in the duties they can undertake. However, pre-deployment psychological screening has a chequered history. In World War II, the USA identified around 2 million men as being at risk of breaking down under the stress of combat, the majority of whom subsequently proved to be resilient, effective soldiers [11] . Recent efforts to screen military personnel have demonstrated a similar lack of precision [12] ; a study [13] screened military personnel for mental disorders pre-deployment, a frequently reported riskfactor [14] , only to find that it had low positive predictive value for developing mental health disorders postdeployment.",

A recent review on screening within the emergency services [15] identified multiple predictors of mental health including neuroticism, pre-existing psychopathology, trauma history, maladaptive coping styles including catastrophic thinking and rumination, and social factors, such as substance related disorders. Still, the study came to conclude that there were no reliable ways to enhance personnel selection through screening and the authors deduced that further research on this topic was needed. The review [15] , however, was limited to individuals working in general emergency service roles rather than disaster responders with most of the identified studies only including trainee police officers and firefighters.",

Conversely, voluntary status, previous history of mental illness and previous life stressors spanning from in the past 3 months to throughout life, did emerge as reliable predictors. Locus of control, attachment style, childhood environment, and whether a person is reassured by physicians when unwell and experiencing symptoms were also identified as possible predictors and might be worthy of additional research as relatively few studies have assessed these features.

These results deviate from previous findings. Both being a woman and belonging to an ethnic minority have often been identified as vulnerability factors for psychopathology as such individuals may be more susceptible to life-time stress [79, 82] . Similarly, our finding that those with lower education were not more at risk of psychological distress is contrary to other researcher's views that less educated people are more vulnerable to trauma because they have a reduced capacity to make sense of difficult experiences [83] . It was also unexpected to find that marital status was not associated with vulnerability; being married or in a long term relationship has been assumed to be associated with greater social support, which in turn is associated with reduced vulnerability to distress [84] . These findings suggest that such demographic variables are less relevant as predictors of distress or disorder among those people who choose to work in the field of disaster response, perhaps reflecting a generally high level of resilience among the group.",

This suggests that emergency services have procedures in place, such as mental health training for managers [85] , to protect employees with such predisposing factors.

Practical difficulties exist in basing pre-deployment screening on these findings however. First, those studies that explored life stressors used a range of time-periods in their measures, from life-stressors experienced in the past three to 6 months to those experienced at any point in the participant's life. Excluding or supporting all employees who have ever experienced a life stressor would be impractical and probably detrimental; it would prevent people who have experienced prior challenges from using their experience as a disaster worker. The evidence from this review suggests that people who have experienced significant life stressors should have their fitness to deploy carefully scrutinised and their mental health carefully monitored. Second, although a robust association was found between a history of mental illness and future mental health problems following humanitarian or disaster work, it remains unclear whether the increased risk of developing mental health problems post deployment is only related to recent episodes of ill mental health or not. Once again, we suggest that having a prior mental health history should not be seen as a bar to deployment, but as an indicator that someone's fitness to deploy should be carefully scrutinised by suitably experienced occupational health professionals and their mental health carefully monitored.",

Organisations would be well advised to encourage staff to talk about mental health which may help empower them to seek support [88, 89] . We would also suggest ensuing that program managers have access to mental-health training and well-developed protocols for differential responses based on the level of presenting problems and any identified risk to self or others [85] .

With few exceptions, the evidence base underlying the variables that might be included in such screening is weak. Given that risks also exist for screening, including the risk of inappropriately excluding skilled staff and of enhancing stigma or discrimination against those identified as high risk [86] , employers may wish to exert caution when using screening tools until better quality evidence relating to their use become available. Our findings suggest that in some cases, careful scrutiny of individuals who appear vulnerable by appropriately skilled occupational health staff is warranted.",

In particular, the use of distress as the primary endpoint in many studies posed a difficulty. Distress, at least in the shortterm, is a normal response to a traumatic exposure and does not necessarily indicate the presence of any mental health disorder. On this basis, pre-employment screening for risk factors for distress may be uncalled for. On the other hand, distressed employees may require additional support from their colleagues and line manager, making identification of risk factors a worthwhile exercise. In this review, we elected to include studies relating to both distress and disorder. Although we include both types of outcome in our synthesis, our impression is that excluding distress would not have dramatically altered our conclusions. It would be helpful if future studies could look at the risk of experiencing longer term illness rather than short term distress.",

Our results do support disaster response organisations ensuring that volunteers are as well prepared and supported as professional disaster works. Additionally, people with a prior history of mental illness, or who have recently experienced significant life stressors, should be scrutinised by occupational health staff to ensure that any associated risks are properly managed. However, our results suggest that until better evidence becomes available, there is no role for the use of pre-employment and pre-deployment mental health screening for this population.",
