Awareness was lower compared with previous surveys of similar Australian studies showing that up to 49% of pilgrims were aware of MERS-CoV; 7,12 other studies have shown 45% of Turkish and 65% of French pilgrims to be aware. 8, 9 Importantly, this study showed that pilgrims who were aware of MERS-CoV were twice more likely to intend to avoid contact with camels and consume their raw products during Hajj than those who were unaware. Similarly, those who were concerned of catching MERS during Hajj were approximately four times more likely to intend to use facemask during Hajj. This may indicate that pilgrims' awareness of infectious diseases is reflected in how acceptable they find using some preventive measures and is consistent with a previous study by our team that showed that pilgrims who were aware of MERS-CoV were also significantly more aware of its risks from drinking unpasteurized camel milk compared with those who were unaware (43% vs 23%, P < 0.01). 12 Conversely, this study highlights that while the knowledge and perceived susceptibility to the disease were associated with their intention to use preventive measures, these factors were absent in their actual use. Theoretically, the frame work of \"precaution adoption model\" sets forward stages of health behavior change in an individual and the factors that lead people to move from one stage to another such as awareness, perceived severity and susceptibility, and cues to action. 13 However, in this study we observed that perceived severity and susceptibility did not seem to play much role in motivating the pilgrims to comply with preventive measures (Figure 1 ). Although majority of pilgrims who were concerned with contacting MERS-CoV at Hajj planned to use preventive measures, in practice few applied the measures and no significant difference was observed between those who were concerned and those who were not. This may indicate that among Hajj pilgrims, there may be unique factors and barriers that affect their compliance with preventive measures against the infectious diseases which needs further investigation. Other studies have documented the pilgrims' willingness to comply with MERS-CoV preventive measures, 8, 9 in practice many participants might not have adhered to those as seen in this study. Two percent (n \u00bc 7) of pilgrims actually came into contact with camels or consumed their products during their pilgrimage, which is an improvement compared with the previous year when between 7 and 16% pilgrims were reported to be exposed to camels. 12, 14 This apparent decline may be attributed to the Saudi Arabian authorities' banning of bringing and sacrificing camels into Hajj sites in 2015. 15 To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study which has assessed pilgrims' awareness about MERS-CoV and their actual practice of risk avoidance, especially their contact with camels at Hajj; however, the study findings have limited generalizability outside of Australia. Additionally, the pilgrims' participation in the pre-travel survey may have increased their awareness of the recommended preventive health measures, leading to higher reported usage (known as 'the Hawthorne effect'). Although this is certainly a theoretical consideration, research into the Hawthorne effect on practice-based research suggests that its impact is minimal. 16 Moreover, the exact site and time of camel exposure were not explored, and data collection relied on self-report.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 455, "end": 457, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2441, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2779, "end": 2782, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1864, "end": 1873, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, this study showed that many Australian pilgrims are unaware of the risk of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia; and some engaged in high-risk practices such as coming in contact with camels.
