            "text": "The influenza pandemic of 2009 saw the emergence of a new influenza A (H1N1) 2009 strain that showed initial resistance to adamantanes and susceptibility to oseltamivir (Dawood et al., 2009). However, by the summer of 2009, there were reports of isolates with an amino acid change from histidine (H) to tyrosine (Y) at position 275 in the neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein that was linked to oseltamivir resistance (Chen et al., 2009, Harvala et al., 2010, Janies et al., 2010, Thabet et al., 2010, WHO, 2009a). Some of these cases were identified in Alberta, Canada starting in July 2009. Although the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance in the 2009\u20132010 respiratory season has been low, there have been instances in the recent past of dramatic increases in oseltamivir and adamantane resistance in seasonal influenza A (IFVA) over a relatively short time frame in the absence of selective pressure by anti-viral usage (Deyde et al., 2007, Dharan et al., 2009, Hauge et al., 2009, Hurt et al., 2009, Janies et al., 2010, Nelson et al., 2009, Pabbaraju et al., 2010, Sheu et al., 2008). Resistance to oseltamivir has been reported to result from point mutations in several regions of the NA protein of the virus (e.g., D79G, S247G or S247N, and H275Y) (Sheu et al., 2008). Phylogenetic studies have revealed that the oseltamivir-resistant seasonal IFVA (H1N1) strain evolved from a susceptible strain (clade 2B) which circulated in the 2007\u20132008 season by acquiring the H275Y change in the NA gene (Zaraket et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Currently, the gold standard method for detection of the C823T nucleotide polymorphism that leads to the H275Y amino acid change is dideoxy Sanger sequencing of the NA gene. Neuraminidase inhibition assays including commercial kits such as the NA-Star\u00ae Influenza Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) have been described for phenotypic resistance testing (Hurt et al., 2009). These phenotypic assays require culturing of the virus, which would not be possible in the case of novel sub-type variants such as the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prior to characterization of the virus. Both sequencing and phenotypic testing are labor intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. The use of pyrosequencing for monitoring nucleotide changes has also be described, however this requires specialized instrumentation (Deyde et al., 2009, Deyde et al., 2010). A reverse-transcriptase PCR coupled with a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (RTPCR-RFLP) has been described for seasonal H1N1 viruses but it is a lengthy process and not practical for high volume testing (Guo et al., 2009). A multiplex RT-PCR for subtyping and determination of oseltamivir resistance for seasonal and pandemic H1N1 influenza A viruses has been reported recently using liquid microarrays on the Luminex platform (Mahony et al., 2010). Real-time reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes for allelic discrimination have been described for the detection of H275Y mutation in seasonal H1N1 viruses (Bolotin et al., 2009, Carr et al., 2008, Operario et al., 2010) and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses (van der Vries et al., 2010). Rapid methods for the detection of mutations leading to oseltamivir resistance allow diagnostic laboratories to monitor the development and transmission of resistance especially in high risk populations such as immuno-compromised patients and patients requiring antiviral treatment.",

Samples that test positive for IFVA are tested subsequently for H1, H3 and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 sub-types (Dawood et al., 2009, Pabbaraju et al., 2009). Specimens from patients with a significant travel history, epidemiological links to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, severe respiratory infection, immuno-compromised/bone marrow transplant cases and intensive care unit patients were identified based on the requisitions submitted by the physician. Additionally, patients from the community with none of the above predisposing factors for development of resistance were also included in the analysis. Selected pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus confirmed samples were tested for oseltamivir resistance using the gold standard Sanger sequencing method (n\n = 306). Sixty-nine specimens were selected for the assay validation, of which 45 were upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, 24 were lower respiratory specimens including endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage and auger suction.",

Nucleotide sequences of the primers and probes are indicated in Table 1\n. Optimal primer concentrations were determined by checkerboard titrations using concentrations ranging from 400 nM to 800 nM.

The Ct values by this screening assay for the three discordant samples were 26.44, 35.48, and 36.79. A negative result suggests either a low viral load or sequence variation in the primer or probe binding region. The sequence of the assay detection region was determined for these samples and analyzed for the presence of mutations. The sample with a Ct value of 35.48 had no change in the probe binding region indicating that the sample possibly tested negative as a result of low viral load. The samples with Ct values of 26.44 and 36.79 were found to have a base pair mutation at different positions in the probe binding region (Fig. 2\n). Researchers using this region for the design of probes to detect oseltamivir resistance should be aware of the presence of these mutations in some isolates.

The current gold standard methods for detection of resistance include phenotypic detection using the NA-Star\u00ae assay from Applied Biosystems or genetic detection of relevant mutations using Sanger sequencing. Both of these methodologies are labor intensive, time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, phenotypic methods require viral culture which may not be feasible for novel sub-type influenza viruses that are restricted to high-level biosafety environments. Other methods such as reverse-transcriptase PCR coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (RTPCR-RFLP), pyrosequencing, microarray and multiplex RT-PCR with Luminex detection technologies have also been reported for detection of resistance but require specialized equipment and training (Bolotin et al., 2009, Carr et al., 2008, Deyde et al., 2009, Deyde et al., 2010, Guo et al., 2009, Hindiyeh et al., 2010, Mahony et al., 2010, Operario et al., 2010, van der Vries et al., 2010).",

This may result in false negative results; the presence of such mutations was detected in this study and has been published previously (Hindiyeh et al., 2010). To address this issue degenerate probes have been utilized by other investigators, however, the issue of cross reactivity and sensitivity was not investigated thoroughly (Hindiyeh et al., 2010). SNP assays may also be unable to detect minor populations in heterogenous mixtures of H275 and H275Y alleles within some specimens. Given the concerns about how H275Y SNP assays perform in the context of mixed viral populations and mutations in the probe-binding region, the authors feel that the results of a SNP assay should be interpreted with caution and ambiguous results should be confirmed by sequencing.",
