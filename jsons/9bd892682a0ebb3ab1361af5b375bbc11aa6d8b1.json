A dynamic process is observed in the variation of codon usage of the strains enrolled in these studies. These results suggest a balance of mutational bias and natural selection, which allow the virus to explore and re-adapt its codon usage to different environments.

IAV is one of the most important infectious diseases in humans [2] . Unlike most pathogens where exposure leads to lasting immunity in the host, IAV presents a moving antigenic target [3] , evading specific immunity triggered by previous infections. This process, called antigenic drift, is the result of the selective fixation of mutations in the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein and to a lesser extent in the neuraminidase (NA) protein [4] . Variants that best escape the host immune response are thought to have a significant reproductive advantage [5] . Another process, called reassortment, is also considered a major force in the evolution of IAV [4] . It occurs when the virus acquires an HA and/or NA of a different IAV subtype (via reassortation) of one or more gene segments. This process has been in the basis of the devastating influenza pandemics that occurred several times in the last century [6] .",

In several organisms, natural selection and mutational input seem to bias codon use toward a certain subset of codons [11] . Two major models have been proposed to explain codon usage: the translational selection and the mutational models [12] . Codon usage bias related to translation efficiency (at two different levels: speed and accuracy) seems to be linked to local cognate isoacceptors tRNAs abundances, which in turn determine the major codon preferences [13] . On the other hand, discrepancies on codon usage could be due to genome compositional constraints and mutational biases [14] .

The correlation between the position on the first dimensional factor generated by this analysis on RSCU (20.7% of the total variability) for each strain and the respective G + C content at synonymous variable third position (GC 3 s) values was significant (r = \u22120.47, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, this dimensional factor also significantly correlated with A content at synonymous variable third position (A 3 s, r = 0.68, p < 0.0001) and G content at the same position (G 3 s, r = \u22120.71, p < 0.0001) ( Figure 1 ). This means that the major factor shaping codon usage among these strains is an opposite trend between purines at third codon positions. Furthermore, this result is mainly due to the frequencies of the codons CGA (Arg) on one side of the distribution and GCG (Ala) and CGG (Arg) at the other side (see Additional file 1: Table S1 ). In other words, the differential usage of three low frequent codons (RSCU \u2264 0.63) is among the major factor shaping codon usage among these strains.",

Interestingly, when the second dimensional factor (11.1% of the total variability) was analyzed, we found that the position of each strain significantly correlated (r = 0.64, p < 0.0001) with the respective usage of the dinucleotide CpG. Besides, although the global usage of this dinucleotide is very low, we found that the correlation is due to the differential usage of CGU (Arg) and CCG (Pro) codons, since these triplets display the most extreme values on the second dimensional factor (see Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Importantly, we also found that the third and the fourth dimensional factors of COA (8.7% and 5.5% of the total variability, respectively), are again mainly linked to the low usage of codons containing the dinucleotide CpG, mainly at the positions 2 and 3. Moreover, among the 16 dinucleotides, 15 are highly correlated with the first dimensional factor value in COA (Table 2 ).

This is triggered by the intracellular Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) Tool-like 9 (TLR9), which activates several immune response pathways [28] . It seems reasonable to suggest that exists among vertebrates a TLR9-like mechanism acting at the RNA level [29] .

Marked CpG deficiency has been observed in several other RNA viruses [24, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , including H1N1pdm IAV [12, 30] .

By deoptimization of codon usage (replacing wild-type codons with codons and codon combinations whose sequences impair replication and/or expression), it might be possible to attenuate a virus [41] . Moreover, as the codon changes do not alter the protein sequence, the antigenicity should not differ from the wild-type virus. Besides, codon changes tend to have individually small fitness effects, so many nucleotide changes will be required to restore wild-type fitness, itself requiring 100 s or more generations [42] [43] [44] [45] . This \"death by a thousand cuts\" strategy may provide an alternative method of attenuation [46] . Interestingly, it has been show that replacement of natural codons with synonymous triplets with increased frequencies of CpG gives rise to inactivation of Poliovirus infectivity [47] . Very recent studies revealed that this strategy can be applied to IAV [48] . Gly GGA UCC(9), GCC(15), CCC (7), ACC(0) 31",
