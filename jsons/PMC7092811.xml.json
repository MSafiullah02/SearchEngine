For instance, beside isolation of Enterococcus spp. and Salmonella spp., Al-Ruwaili et al. (M.A., 2012) reported seroprevalence for E. coli, Brucella abortus and group A rotavirus. Fouda and Al-Mujalii (2007) reported clinical infection caused by Proteus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens. Resulting either from rearing in close vicinity to small and large ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goat or an experimental infection, clinical susceptibility of camels to B. abortus and B. melitensis has also been reported previously (Damir et al., 1989; Hamdy and Amin, 2002). Similarly, for viral infections in camels, seroprevalence (Abraham et al., 2005; Swai et al., 2011; Woma et al., 2015) and sequence-based phylogeny has been revealed for peste des petits ruminants (PPR) (Omani et al., 2019). Seroprevalence, either upon natural exposure (Chandel et al., B. 2003) or experimental infection (Batten et al., 2011), also indicate its susceptibility to BTV.",

            "text": "For an agriculture-based economy worldwide, such as Pakistan, rearing small and large ruminants is an integral part of such a production system. However, despite the use of necessary preventive and disease control measures, repeated occurrence of infectious diseases in small and large ruminants is not uncommon resulting in subsequent economic losses in terms of morbidity, mortality and trade embargo (e.g., in case of brucellosis and PPR). While an extended range of host susceptibility including camel has been evidenced for some pathogens, such as brucellosis (Abbas and Agab, 2002; Gwida et al., 2012), PPR (Abraham et al., 2005; Swai et al., 2011; Woma et al., 2015) and BT (Chandel et al., 2003), most of the disease control interventions accounts for small and large ruminants whereas unusual hosts and/or natural reservoirs, such as camels, remain neglected for any of such disease control initiatives, including routine vaccination. Such a policy drawback not only plays an important role in disease epizootiology, particularly in settings where these diseases are endemic, but also serves an obstacle in its control and subsequent eradication, such as proposed by OIE/FAO for PPR. This is important to consider because, with an overall population of 1.2 million heads, Pakistan ranks 8th among major camel raising countries around the globe and does produce 908,000 tons of milk and 50,603 tons of meat per annum for human consumption (Economic Survey of Pakistan 2018\u201319). With this background, we conducted a large-scale antigen (pathogen)- and antibody-based surveillance for three of the most important endemic infectious diseases (brucellosis, PPR and BT) in camels representing a wide geographical region in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Providing a prevalence status for each of the infectious diseases, the study outcomes are expected to ascertain necessary interventions for disease management and control particularly in a setting where there is frequent contact among ruminants and camels.",

Socioeconomic activities in this particular region are mostly centered for agriculture and livestock production for human livelihood. The region has an arid climate with an extreme weather conditions such as hot summer and cold winter where the recorded average temperature and humidity is 25.6 \u00baC and 48.0% (https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Humidity-perc,Multan,Pakistan), respectively. Within this region, there exists a dense population of camels in a desert area called \u201cCholistan\u201d. The camel rearing or production system is largely dominated by the sedentary farming system followed by nomadic and/or transhumant system. Sedentary system involves camel rearing in a designated land along with small and large ruminants, while nomadic/transhumant system is characterized by diversification of herds with small ruminant, seasonal migration for feed and water, and loaning/sharing of herd or animals within a herd. Despite importance of camels in meeting the routine livelihood of individual/s involved in each type of the rearing systems, there is an absolute paucity of proper farming and husbandry practices exclusive for camels and they are usually kept along with domestic ruminants including sheep, goat, cattle and buffalo. Such a mixed livestock production practice most likely supports an increased incidence of disease/s which has potential to transmit across the species. Though, in the recent past, L&DD Punjab has conducted a mass-scale campaign for camel population enumeration, farmer's awareness on camel diseases and their management, deworming, trainings to the farmers and veterinarian in the area (http://livestockpunjab.gov.pk/LiveStockAdmin/uploads/item_files/camel_project_njbnu.pdf); howeve other than hemoparasites and/or fecal parasites examination, there lacks a continuously updated system for vaccination, disease monitoring and surveillance in camels across the Punjab province.",

For a sera positive or negative to one of the selected pathogens, the development of color intensity varied accordingly and measured in terms of optical density (OD) (iMark\u2122 Microplate Absorbance Reader, BioRad, USA) at 450 nm for both brucellosis and BT, while it was 492 nm for PPR.

Therefore, for a number of infectious diseases, time-to-time antigen and antibody detection-based surveillance has previously been conducted in small and large ruminants in Pakistan. Nevertheless, except for a few studies on brucellosis in camels (Shahzad et al., 2017; Baloch et al., 2017), there is an absolute paucity of data on surveillance of PPR and BT, and subsequent necessary interventions in terms of evidence-based decision making to ultimately improve veterinary and public health, the environment and the society. An integration of animal health surveillance into an economic framework has indicated no or a very limited economic value; however, when combined with decisions on interventions, surveillance contribute to disease mitigation and therefore justify the resources used (Howe et al., 2013). This can fairly be evidenced for Foot and Mouth disease in Pakistan where disease control and eradication strategies are taken as top-priority by national and international organizations (FAO/OIE). With this background understanding, we conducted pathogen- and antibody-based surveillance for selected veterinary and public health pathogens in the camel population of Southern Punjab, Pakistan. An indirect antigen-antibody interaction (iELISA) was employed for the detection of anti-Brucella antibodies, while competitive ELISAs were used for the detection of antibodies for PPR and bluetongue. The used assays are highly efficient, sensitive and specific for each of the selected pathogens and are considered reliable for sero-surveillance of brucellosis, BT and PPR (Paweska et al., 2002: Biteau-Coroller et al., 2006; Bodjo et al., 2018).",

Such a high level of seroprevalence of these pathogens is not surprising because of the reported endemicity of the studied pathogens in livestock populations of the Punjab province (Khan et al., 2008; Abubakar et al., 2010; Aziz-ul-Rahman et al., 2016, 2017; Shabbir et al., 2018; T. Sohail et al., 2019). As can be evidenced from the annual reports of Livestock and Dairy Development department of the Punjab province (http://www.livestockpunjab.gov.pk/dashboard/lndd_punjab), a frequent occurrence of clinical cases of PPR and brucellosis in small and large ruminants are not uncommon, while for bluetongue, it is conceived to be sub-clinical. Since the camels are not included for any vaccination program for prevalent infectious pathogens in the country, particularly those included in this study, the serum-based prevalence is truly an indication of natural exposure, either from the environment or via horizontal transmission while sharing vicinity or close proximity for housing and pasture with other livestock.",

A varying prevalence of BT in camels has also been evidenced from neighboring countries, as well as other parts of the world, such as 67.8% in Iran (Mozaffari et al., 2013), 41.8% and 42% in Morocco (Touil et al., 2012; Drif et al., 2018), 25.7% in Saudi Arabia (Yousef, Al-Eesa and Al-Blowi, 2012), 21% in Algeria (Madani et al., 2011) and 19.3% in India (Chandel et al., 2003). Taking camels a potential reservoir of BTV, particularly in case of subclinical infection, either the movement or rearing of camels in mixed farming system could be speculated as one of the potential sources of infection to other susceptible hosts. This is important because recent studies have indicated a role of camelids as a disease reservoir that may lead to dissemination and persistence of BTV into the environment and, therefore, can result in an increased risk of infection in susceptible ruminants (Garc\u0131a-Bocanegra et al., 2011; Batten et al., 2011). Though disease is believed to be sub-clinical in Pakistan, an increased prevalence in camel population in this study and those reported in the recent years in small and large ruminants in Punjab province (T. Sohail et al., 2019), and small ruminants in Baluchistan province (Sohail et al., 2018) and Khyber Pakhtun Khwan province (Malik et al., 2018) suggest otherwise and, therefore, urge to strengthen clinical expertise of veterinarians to a level enough to discriminate BT from other closely related clinical conditions, such as PPR and foot and mouth disease, and develop appropriate laboratory-based differential diagnostics. As far as genome-based serotyping of prevalent BTV is concerned in camel population, multiple serotypes (1, 8 and 11) were identified. The current observation agrees with most recent studies in the country where, dominated by serotype 8, a co-circulation of serotypes 2, 4, 6, 9, 11 and 16 in small and large ruminants originating from a wide geographical area has been evidenced (Sohail et al., 2018; Sohail et al., 2019; Malik et al., 2019). Hence, while living in close vicinity to small and large ruminants, an identification of serotypes 8 and 11 in camels is not unusual other than detection of serotype 1. Such an evidence argues for host-dependent potential of each of the BTV serotypes simply because, compared to other serotypes such as 4, 6, 8, 11, 14 and 16, a previous study observed an increased incidence of serotype 1 in camels (Drif et al., 2018). Though camels is generally conceived to be a non-susceptible host for BTV in the past, experimental investigations have suggested otherwise, where, particularly for serotype 1 and 8, a low rate of replication or infection along with development of neutralizing antibodies have been evidenced and therefore may serve as potential source of infection for susceptible hosts living in close proximity (Zanolari et al., 2010; Batten et al., 2011; Schulz et al., 2012). Thus, routine BT surveillance in camels should be conducted in disease endemic region/s in order to elucidate disease epidemiology and future interventions for its control.",

Indeed, there exists a controversy regarding clinical infection of PPRV in camels (Ul-Rahman et al., 2020). A few studies have reported an occurrence of natural clinical infection with a mortality ranging from 60%\u221290% (Khalafalla et al., 2010: Saeed et al., 2015), whereas another study claimed an absolute lack of clinical infection upon experimental exposure (Fakri et al., 2019). We observed a higher seroprevalence (19.46%) in camels as compared to the ones reported from Ethiopia (3.0% and 3.36%), Nigeria (7.9%) and Egypt (14.0%) (Roger et al., 2001; Haroun et al., 2002; Abraham et al., 2005; Woma et al., 2015). Such variations in seroprevalence may partly be attributed to differences in management system, health care practices, sample size, study periods, climate, socio-ecological factors and presence of concurrent disease infection (Khalafalla et al., 2010; Kihu et al., 2015). None of the samples was found positive for genome corresponding to the nucleoprotein gene. Though further investigations in camels are needed, one of the potential reasons may be the fact that PPR virus-induced viraemia is short-lived and virus does reside somewhere else in the body tissues. This is important because, despite exhibition of clinical picture corresponding to PPR infection in its primary host (the goat), genome corresponding to PPR virus was either not detected or detected in blood in a very low concentration among experimental animals (Bamouh et al., 2019). We used N gene specific PCR amplification simply because, among the molecular markers across the whole length of viral genome, it is considered the most replicative of the virus genes and the sequence and residue characteristics provide a distinctive resolution for PPRV epidemiology in disease endemic countries (Muniraju et al., 2014; Parida et al., 2015). Although the detection of PPR antibodies with absence of viral nucleic acids in camels in this study may not be an indicative of clinical disease, it remains to be investigated whether the existence of the virus in camels has any epidemiological significance for persistence of virus and subsequent transmission to other susceptible animal species.",

This is expected because the disease is endemic in the country with multiple evidences on varying rate of prevalence in human, small and large ruminants (Shafee et al., 2011; Arif et al., 2018; Saeed et al., 2019) and camels (Fatima et al., 2016; Shahzad et al., 2017). Despite zoonotic implications and potential of Brucella spp. to target a wide range of hosts (Musa et al., 2008; Khamesipour et al., 2014), brucellosis in camels has not received much attention worldwide. Camels are not believed to be a primary host of disease; however, when kept in a mixed farming system with small and large ruminants, they have a potential to play a significant role in cross-species transmission of brucellosis including humans (Rhodes et al., 2016; Viana et al., 2016), while sharing same vicinity for water and pasture (Teshome et al., 2003). A varying disease prevalence has also been evidenced in other camel rearing settings worldwide; however, rate of seroprevalence has been found to be relatively low (2\u20135%) in countries where camels are kept as nomadic pastoralists/agro-pastoralists, compared to those where they are kept intensively in a mixed animal population (8\u201315%) (Al-Khalaf and El-Khaladi, 1989; Radwan et al., 1995, 1992; Abbas and Agab, 2002), such as the studied herds in Pakistan.",

            "text": "MMultiple species of Brucella with a varying rate of prevalence have been evidenced from camel herds across many parts of the globe (Hamdy and Amin, 2002; Dawood, 2008; Khamesipour et al., 2014; Viana et al., 2016). A few of the examples include B. melitensis in Libya (Gameel et al., 1993), Egypt (Abdelgawad et al., 2017) and Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2002), and B. abortus in Sudan (Yagoub et al., 1990). Despite the fact that 1) we used a well-validated assay that can simultaneously detect and differentiate presence of particular Brucella spp. in a given sample, and 2) the presence of multiple Brucella spp., particularly B. abortus and B. melitensis, is being speculated in the susceptible animal population including camels in Pakistan without any laboratory-based evidence, we found a total of 19 herds (25.7%) exclusively infected with B. abortus. This corresponds to previous observations, where only B. abortus was reported in seropositive sheep and goat (Ali et al., 2015) and camel population (Fatima et al., 2016) in Pakistan. However, a caution in this regard must be considered, because detection of the bacterium may vary according to a particular body fluid or tissue, and therefore there is a need for future investigations. For instance, a varying rate of detection of B. abortus and B. melitensis was reported for blood sample (4.1% vs. 2.4%) and lymph node (3.3% vs. 1.6%), respectively (Khamesipour et al., 2014). In another study, again using blood and lymph nodes, genome corresponding to Brucella abortus was detected in blood (2.2%) and Brucella melitensis in lymph nodes (3.0%) exclusively (Khamesipour et al., 2015). Hence, with these variable outcomes depending upon type of tissue to be used for antigen detection, another suggested thing to do in future is an antibody-based screening in camel population using a highly specific and sensitive assay corresponding exclusively to B. melitensis.\n",

            "text": "A number of categorical variables were significantly associated with an increased seropositivity of BT, PPR and brucellosis in camels in this study. These included pregnancy status (non-pregnant), mixed farming system, and breed (Desi) for BT, intensive or mixed feeding for PPR, and body condition and breed (Desi) for brucellosis. In a previous study from India, a high seroprevalence of BT in Desi breeds of camels has been evidenced (Chandel et al., 2003). Similarly, an increased odds of seropositivity were found for buffalo breed, large ruminants (cattle and buffalo) with a history of abortion (T. Sohail et al., 2019), and breed-type, parity, transhumant nature of animals and presence of vector for goat (Sohail et al., 2018). The odds of occurrence of PPR have been found varying in different geographical settings. For instance, in a study from Nigeria, age and body condition was found to be associated with the seropositivity in camels (Woma et al., 2015). Another study reported pregnancy, recent calving and old-age as risk factor for an increased seropositivity (Khalafalla et al., 2010). Although a number of potential risk factors are identified for an increased seropositivity of PPR, BT and brucellosis in animals other than camels, such as transboundary animal movements, introduction of new animal in a flock, environmental factors (increased temperature, humidity and rainfall), lack of awareness about disease, role of wildlife, illegal vaccination, lack of vector or other appropriate control measures etc., it is difficult to correlate observations reported in studies involving camels simply because the susceptibility of pathogen varies at large for small/large ruminants and camels.",

            "text": "This study had a few limitations. For instance, pooled sera were used for detection of specific pathogen through multiplex PCR, RT-PCR and rt-PCR. The pooling of samples was unavoidable due to resource limitations precluding the use of the commercial kit on samples from a large number of individuals. Although rt-PCR assay is considered more sensitive than conventional PCR, a use of standard PCR for brucellosis and PPR, and rt-PCR for BTV was associated to the availability of assay for each of these pathogens under limited resources in the laboratory. A random selection of animals was a consequence of the fact that selection of animals for resampling based on preliminary disease prevalence data was not practicable because most of the animal owners were nomadic and there exist an absolute lack of animal identification/tagging system. All camels included in this study were apparently healthy at the time of sampling and, according to the owners, none of them had previously shown clinical signs of brucellosis, BT and PPR, or at least they were not aware of it. Hence, these results indicate the disease carrying potential of camels posing a serious concern to veterinary and public health, and subsequent food insecurity. A continuous disease surveillance and appropriate interventions, particularly the vaccination of camel population, is suggested for an effective control of brucellosis, BT and PPR in the region.",
