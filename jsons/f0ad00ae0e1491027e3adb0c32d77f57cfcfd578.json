            "text": "Mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19) spread are used for guiding the design of mitigation steps aimed at containing and decelerating the contagion, and at identifying impending breaches of health care system surge capacity. The challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections and mortality counts are compounded by the geographic heterogeneity of the population. This combination complicates prediction, particularly when homogenized population models with an underlying assumption of well mixed cohorts are used. To address this problem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The setting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency of contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may change over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other communities where the infection is present. To account for these important aspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact between its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census and cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network, which can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation measures. In order to make the network SEIR model that we propose easy to customize, it is formulated in terms of easily interpretable parameters that can be estimated from available community level data. The models parameters are estimated with Bayesian techniques using COVID-19 data for the states of Ohio and Michigan. The network model also gives rise to a geographically distributed computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion, e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas. arXiv:2005.06137v1 [q-bio.PE]",

Both SIR and SEIR models assume that the underlying population and the subpopulations within each compartment are well mixed, a necessary condition for the mean field description to be accurate. In the case of COVID-19, the lack of immunity of the population due to the novelty of the virus and the ease of transmission make its spread very sensitive to the type and frequency of contacts among individuals in the community. Such contact depends partly on population density; therefore separately modeling communities with differing population density can reduce violation of the mean field assumption.",

In response to these needs, the aim of this study is to adapt a new network SEIR inspired model of COVID-19 spread to understand the dynamics of the pandemic in a network of 18 counties in the region of Northeast Ohio around Cleveland, and a network of 19 counties in Southeast Michigan around Detroit. The computational model addresses all of the points discussed above: The model parameters may be variable in time, and up to date Bayesian computational tools are used to inform the model on a daily basis regarding the progression of the epidemic, providing also an estimate of the uncertainties of the estimates. The metapopulation model uses census data to track population density and the movement of individuals between communities [3] . Furthermore, the model gives an estimate of the size of the asymptomatic cohort based on the observed new infection count. Finally, to avoid introducing intractable parameters that limit use and interpretation, the basic model is kept as simple as possible without overlooking some fundamental characteristics of COVID-19. The output comprises interpretable quantities that can be immediately communicated to public health and health system decision makers, and allow a comparison with existing model predictions. The computational framework can be shown to reproduce within reasonable uncertainty the observed spreading timeline between the communities included in this study; and the predictive skills over relatively short time windows, up to a few weeks, can be demonstrated.",

The model can be modified to account for an incubation period during which an individual has been exposed but has not yet become infectious by adding the exposed (E) cohort. This is the essence of the SEIR model of [2] which has been used successfully to model epidemics for nearly a century. In the case of the COVID-19, there is evidence of exposed individuals shedding the virus already a few days before developing any symptoms. In fact, according to some recent laboratory tests the amount of virus released is largest right before the onset of the symptoms, and over the next few days it start to decay. Moreover, antibodies found in individuals who did not report any symptoms of COVID-19, points towards a presence of a potentially large number of asymptomatic infectious individuals, who spread the virus without being detected, due to the current practice of reserving the testing for persons with clear symptoms. Furthermore, if the I cohort in the SEIR model comprises symptomatic infected and infectious individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19, it is reasonable to assume that most of them will be in some form of isolation, hence with limited contribution to the spreading of the infection.",

To underline this interpretative difference, and the immersion of the asymptomatic (A) cohort in E, we refer to the model as SE(A)IR model. Figure 1 shows a schematic compartment diagram and the governing equations, illustrating the modification to the standard SEIR model to account for asymptomatic infectious individuals. the standard SEIR model, the flux E \u2192 R has been added, and the nonlinear interaction term is modified by the replacement I \u2192 E + f I.

The latter three parameters (incubation, recovery, and mortality rates) are strongly pathogen dependent and to some extent sensitive to factors like demographics and comorbidities, but for the modeling purposes, they can be considered as independent of time. Arguably, the most important parameter is the product \u03b2r, controlling the rate at which susceptible individuals are infected. While the value of \u03b2 depends mostly on the infectivity power of the virus, the factor r accounting for the frequency of contacts between infectious and susceptible individuals and may change significantly with the introduction or lifting of social distancing.

Each day, the predictions of the particles for the next day are computed and compared to the new data, and particles whose results are in better agreement with the data are retained and replicated, while particles less well fit to explain the data are discarded. After this \"survival of the fittest\" step, the replicated particles are proliferated through a randomization, guaranteeing a rich variability of the particle cloud to account for the variations in the next time step. Since the effects of changing mitigation strategies are reflected in the value of r\u03b2, this quantity is updated daily, thus providing a time series for each particle.

One of the key parameters of interest to us is the ratio \u03c1 = E/I. It turns out that this ratio tends towards an equilibrium value, \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1 * , as the infection progresses, allowing us to define in a very natural way an equivalent of the basic reproduction number R 0 of the SE(A)IR model.

In line with the county by county reporting of the cases, metapopulation network models (MNM) are an appropriate tool to address the population inhomogeneity. To model the effect of daily commuter traffic on COVID-19 spread, an MNM can be designed as a directed graph where the counties constitute the nodes and the weights of the directed edges are proportional to the number of commuters between pairs of counties. Although the epidemic within each county can be described locally with a SE(A)IR model, the model cohorts need to be adjusted to reflect the movement of individuals between counties, thus affecting the infection dynamics. Figure 2 : Schematic representation of the network model with three nodes, with only the in-links and out-links of C 1 included. The symbol n jk indicates the number of residents of node C j commuting to node C k , the home community being an option, and N k is the population size resident in node C k , while N k is the size of the population working at the community C k . The average number of daily contacts in community C k is r k , and \u03b7 is the fraction of time spent in the destination of commute, and 1\u2212\u03b7 is the fraction of time spent in the home community.

Figure 4 shows the outcomes for select counties. In the sample calculations, the recovery and incubation times were kept constants, T rec = 21 days, T inc = 7 days. Figure 5 sheds some light on how the R 0 changes if different values were used. Here, the R 0 value is plotted against the rate of contagion with different combinations of the two time constants. Figure 6 illustrates of the prediction skill of the PF method. In the figure, the last ten day's data are left out from the PF update and the state/parameter estimation is stopped early. Consequently, the state and parameter values for each particle are propagated forward for ten days, and the predicted average of the new cases for each particle is calculated. These average values are used as means for a Poisson process, and random realizations of predicted new cases for each particle is computed. Finally, the predicted data are used to calculate the predictive envelopes of given level of belief. In general, the true data may not fall in the predicted intervals, but in general, the algorithm anticipates . The red arrows indicate the direction of growth of the time constants T rec or T inc , respectively. The derivation of the formula for R 0 is given in [17] . In the form given here, it is implicitly assumed that the infection is in its outbreak phase, and no herd immunity is present. Figure 6 : Examples of the prediction skill of the PF method. The PF updating is stopped ten days before the last data, and the particles are propagated using the last update of the states as initial values, and corresponding estimates for the parameter \u03b2r. The data are simulated drawing them from Poisson distribution, and the 50% and 75% predictive intervals for the data are computed. The true data is shown as stem plots.

Note that in the reference case, the nature of the network caused a 1 to 2 week delay in peak infection for Genesee and Summit counties with respect to Wayne and Cuyahoga counties, while in this reduced traffic scenario, the delay was more prolonged with 3 to 4 week difference. The overall peak of each of the curve remained similar in profile to what was observed in the reference case. This study shows that while the reduction in commuter traffic may delay the rise of infection, it does not attenuate the severity of the disease. ",

In Figure 11 , we observe that the virus initially spreads to the three counties that constitute the core of the Detroit metropolitan region before the lower contact frequency regime begins. After the intriduciotn of the lower contact frequency regime, the infection does not spread to other surrounding counties and is contained to the three core counties, as seen in Figure 12 . In Ohio, the lower contact frequency regime occurs before the virus is able to gain a foothold in Cuyahoga County. In Figure 12 , we notice a small growth in the number of infected, but not enough to result in an appreciable number of infected individuals in the Northeastern Ohio region.

Classical population models [2] have been used extensively to study the spread of epidemics for nearly a century, and the models commonly assume that the populations in the various compartments are homogenous, in the sense that all individuals be- have similarly, and well-mixed, i.e., transmission affects all individuals in a compartment at once [18, 19, 20] . These models can be useful to understand the overall dynamics of an epidemics and provide fairly realistic predictions for a homogeneous population, but may not have enough resolution when the population consists of communities with different socio-urban characteristics or demographics. The need for models that account for the diverse modes of social interaction within each community has been acknowledged for a long time, and the mobility pattern among communities is particularly crucial when trying to forecast the effects of different measures to contain and control the transmission. The concept of metapopulation, intended as a group of spatially separated populations that have some kind of interaction, was initially introduced for insect pests [21] and later used in conjunction with networks to introduce a spatial dimension in modeling transmission of disease. The network aspect comes from the transfer of individuals among the nodes, and the level of communication between any pair of nodes is determined by the mobility network [22] . Information about the mobility network can be gleaned from census data, domestic or international air travel schedules, as relevant for the spatial scale of the model.",

The common feature of these three epidemics was the speed at which their incidence spread over a wide geographic range: in 2003, SARS-CoV spread from Hong Kong to over 30 countries in 4 continents, before being contained, and in 2009 A(H1N1) spread over 30 countries in 3-4 months. By comparison, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country in the world in less than 6 months, following a pattern similar to that of a wild fire. Human recurrent commuting data in metapopulation network models have been used to study changes in contagion processes [23, 24, 25] . For a comparison of large scale computational approaches to epidemic modeling, in particular agent-based approach versus structured metapopulation models, see Figure 10 : Plots of the relative (left to right) susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and deceased populations for the reduced traffic study (Sect. 3.2.2) for (a) Wayne, Genesee, and Sanilac counties in southeast Michigan and (b) Cuyahoga, Summit, and Holmes counties in northeast Ohio. The plots on top have the same y-axis scales and the plots on the bottom are with a relative scale for the y-axis. [26] . Changes in human mobility pattern are often enforced at the outbreak of an epidemic to keep it localized to the original hotspot, however, it has been questioned how effective travel bans really are at containing a pandemic [27, 28, 29, 30] . To contain COVID-19 pandemic, the measures to control human mobility have varied from the ban of most international flights from affected areas to the near suppression of traffic between communities in regions with high prevalence of infections. In addition, additional changes in mobility have been caused by human reaction to the spread of the epidemics [31, 32, 33] . As reported in [34] , the changing perception of risk did indeed affect the 2009 H1N1 pandemic dynamics.",

One important question is where the pandemic will hit next, and how severely the next hotspot will be affected. The geographic pattern followed by the spread of COVID-19 has been rather consistent. As the epidemic moves into a region, the initial hotspots are typically urban centers with large population density and high contact rates, then the infection moves to less crowded communities, where the peak is reached at a later time. The rapidly changing situation and the need of swiftly updating the information based on the inflow of new data underlines the importance of dynamic rather than static models, and the capability of model updating on a daily basis. The proposed Bayesian particle filtering approach combined with a metapopulation network model seeks to address these needs. We refer to [35] as a dynamic metapopulation network model with methodology and goals similar to ours, applied to a network of cities in China. The current study concentrated on 18 counties in Northeastern Ohio and 19 counties in Southeastern Michigan, representing a mix of urban, suburban and rural setting. However, as the network is constructed on a basis of publicly available mobility data from the US Census database, the model can be adapted to any county level network.",

Panels (c) and (g) show the daily reported number of infections on April 4, 2020 in the Michigan counties, and on April 16, 2020 in the Ohio counties, which are remarkably similar to the model predictions, shown in panel (d) and (h). The numerical simulations with altered rates of daily contacts clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures in slowing down the epidemics. In particular, two findings are worth highlighting: First, the simulations demonstrate that compared to an non-diversified social distancing measures in all counties, equally effective is a strategy in which social distancing measures are enforced only if the relative frequency of infected individuals exceed a certain threshold. This finding suggests an efficient and economically less burdensome alternative for state-wide mitigation measures, however, it relies heavily on availability of extensive testing. The second finding, in light of the simulations, is the relative inefficiency of travel restrictions. While mobility is undoubtedly the key factor in spreading of epidemics, somewhat counterintuitively, the volume seems to be only a secondary factor, determining how fast the spreading takes place, and not how widely the epidemics spreads. This finding is in line with the discussion in literature [27, 28, 29, 30] .",

The demographic data can be introduced in the metapopulation model in a straightforward manner, and preliminary tests of doing this are underway. Furthermore, a simultaneous and parallel estimation of the parameters of connected communities will be part of the future work. As demonstrated in earlier articles by the authors [36] , the particle filtering technique is particularly well suited for parallel computing.

The plots on top have the same y-axis scales and the plots on the bottom are with a relative scale for the y-axis.",
