            "text": "Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is a pathogen of worldwide importance for cattle, causing significant economic losses (Brownlie, 1991). BVDV is classified within the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae (Heinz et al., 2000). Pestiviruses are small, enveloped viruses that contain a single-strand positive sense RNA molecule of approximately 12.5 kb. The genome is transcribed as a single open reading frame, flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs). The BVDV polyprotein is co- and post-translationally cleaved to give rise to a number of viral structural and non-structural proteins (Collett et al., 1988). Acute BVDV infection is often clinically unapparent or mild; clinical signs including transient pyrexia, leucopenia, oculonasal discharge and depression. Although frequently unnoticed, acute infection can contribute to or cause a variety of problems including diseases of the reproductive, respiratory and enteric systems (Baker, 1995). BVDV infection during pregnancy may result in foetal infection. Foetuses infected before the onset of immunocompetence can become persistently infected. Persistently infected (PI) animals continuously shed virus and act as a major reservoir of infection for other cattle (Paton et al., 1999).",

Real-time PCR is now being used to identify, classify and quantify many viral pathogens as it is a highly sensitive and rapid method for detecting viral nucleic acid sequences in clinical specimens. Furthermore, real-time PCR is a quantitative technique and as such may be used to assess viral RNA levels. Real-time RT-PCR methods for genotyping BVDV have been described previously (Bhudevi and Weinstock, 2001, Bhudevi and Weinstock, 2003, Lettellier and Kerkhofs, 2003). These papers have focused on the detection and classification of BVDV into either of the two recognised genotypes (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2) rather than monitoring the changes in viral load during the course of an acute or persistent infection. However, as real-time PCR is a quantitative technique it may also be used to assess viral RNA levels during the course of infection and recovery.",

            "text": "Using real-time PCR to quantify the viral RNA levels in BVDV-infected animals presents particular technical and biological challenges. Collection and processing of samples from different animals over a number of different days inevitably results in some degree of sample to sample variation in the technical detection of the target nucleic acids. This arises from differences in efficiency of RNA extraction, reverse transcription or PCR reactions which is made particularly significant by the sensitivity of this technique. These technical variations are often \u201ccontrolled\u201d for by normalisation of the signal to an internal standard, typically a \u201chousekeeping\u201d gene, facilitating the comparison of different data sets. This presents two further problems: firstly, whilst this is common practice, such housekeeping genes are rarely truly static and may alter under experimental conditions (Thellin et al., 1999, Whelan et al., 2003). To take account of this, best practice would recommend assessing the validity of a number of different housekeeping gene targets and comparing them under the test conditions used. This laborious task is the only way to objectively identify more stable mRNA sets. However, this process is not relevant to the BVDV situation during infection as, secondly, during acute infection with BVDV animals experience a measurable leucopenia and the number of cells per volume of blood changes over time. Traditional methods of virus isolation quantitate the amount of virus recovered from a fixed volume of blood irrespective of the cell numbers in this sample, which during acute BVDV infection will fluctuate (Polak and Zmudzinski, 2000). By standardising the viral RNA measured by real-time PCR to a housekeeping gene set the quantitation is essentially done on a per cell basis rather than a per volume basis rendering the comparison of samples from leucopenic calves more difficult and precluding a simple comparison with more traditional virological methods.",

Each sample was spiked with a known amount of a second RNA virus, Canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov), prior to RNA extraction. While the external standard is not an exact mimic of the true target it is subject to the same experimental procedures and provides an external standard for correction of differences in the efficiency of RNA extraction or RT-PCR.

The calves were housed in a purpose-built barn with appropriate bio-security measures in place to avoid exposure to adventitious pathogens. After an initial acclimatisation period the calves were challenged intranasally with 2 \u00d7 106\n TCID50 of virus 456497 (early passage BVDV-1; kindly donated by VLA, Weybridge, UK). EDTA blood samples were taken at appropriate days post-challenge to process for virus isolation and real-time PCR. All EDTA blood samples taken for virology were prepared by lysis of the erythrocytes using ammonium chloride lysis buffer. The samples were subsequently pelleted and washed, as described in Nobiron et al. (2003). To detect BVDV, the samples were diluted 1:5 in maintenance medium and then seeded, in duplicate, onto freshly prepared foetal bovine lung (FBL) cells and incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. After one round of freeze thaw and dilution of material, the inoculum was passed once more onto FBLs, which had been previously seeded onto coverslips, and incubated for a further 5 days. Presence of virus was detected via immuno-fluorescence staining using a BVDV hyperimmune serum and a Cy-3-conjugated anti-bovine antibody. Scoring was performed using a fluorescence microscope and appropriate filter sets.",

Lettellier and Kerkhofs (2003) demonstrated using a BVDV type 1 virus stock that there were 2400 copies of virus genome per infectious particle. This presumably reflects a ratio of infectious to defective viral genomes. Similar ratios have been observed for Yellow Fever Virus (Bae et al., 2003). The results from the current study would support these observations and, in vivo at least, it is proposed that although BVDV RNA is still being detected, infectious virus has been complexed with antibodies thereby leading to cessation of viraemia. In the case of calf 20, virus neutralising antibody titres of 1:564 were measured on day 14 (data not shown), supporting this premise.",

However, housekeeping gene expression can vary and the use of these genes as internal controls should be carefully considered in relation to cell type and the cell metabolism (Thellin et al., 1999). The large number of publications focusing on the validation of internal reference genes demonstrates the difficulty in selecting appropriate candidates. Indeed, many authors now recommend the use of at least two (Dent et al., 1997) or three (Bustin, 2000, Vandesompele et al., 2002) validated housekeeping genes to ensure the accuracy of data. In addition, the use of housekeeping genes to control for the variation in RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis is difficult when a fixed amount of blood is analysed (Johansson et al., 2000). The normal range of leucocyte counts in blood from healthy cattle is 4\u201312 \u00d7 109\n l\u22121 (Blood, 1994), thus demonstrating a potential threefold variation in cell numbers. Furthermore, acute BVDV infection causes transient leucopenia, leading to a reduction in numbers of circulating leucocytes which can be pronounced. Virus virulence as well as host factors may result in the reduction of white blood cells ranging from mild to severe. In the current study all five calves were challenged with the same dose of virus and the degree of leucopenia varied from animal to animal (Fig. 1).",

A second RNA virus, Canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov) was used as a control for the each stage of the method. To enable ease of sample handling the method was based on quantification of BVDV RNA per volume of frozen whole blood. Each bovine blood sample was spiked with a known amount of the reference CECov prior to RNA extraction. The coronavirus was co-extracted and subsequently amplified in a quantitative manner. This enabled validation of nucleic acid isolation and amplification efficiency for each sample and detection of those samples for which sample preparation or amplification failed by determining the signal generated from the CECov standard. This system of \u2018spiking\u2019 samples with a heterologous virus has been used previously for Hepatitis C virus quantification (Cleland et al., 1999, Castelain et al., 2004) and for the detection of Epstein\u2013Bars virus and Cytomegalovirus (Niesters, 2001).",
