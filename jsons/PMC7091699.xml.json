Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed strong interactions between the DNA and the capsid proteins, while separate experiments using fluorescently labelled DNA as a template revealed that the fluorophores were buried within the capsid protein nanotube. These experiments showed DNA strands to act as templates with the capsid proteins assembling around them. Intriguingly, the diameter of the tubes remained the same, irrespective of the length of the DNA template, suggesting that the diameter was determined by the properties of the proteins and contained similar numbers of assembled DNA strands.",
