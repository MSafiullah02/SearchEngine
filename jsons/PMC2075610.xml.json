In addition to activating phagocytosis and secreting superoxides and hydrolytic enzymes, the neutrophil must be able to chemotax, or migrate toward the source of a chemoattractant. Upon activation by a chemoattractant, G-protein coupled receptors on the membrane of the neutrophil change conformation and bind to G proteins, activating a signal transduction pathway that results in intracellular actin polymerization, the formation of pseudopodia, reorientation toward a chemoattractant gradient, and adhesion to and infiltration through the blood vessel endothelium [1], [2]\n",

It is thought to play an important role in allowing phagocytic cells to recognize the presence of bacteria, which are believed to be the source of formyl peptides [3]. FPR is activated by other ligands in addition to fMLF. FPR binds peptides derived from the GP-41 envelope protein of HIV-1 [4], [5]. FPR activation is inhibited by a polypeptide secreted by S. aureus\n[6], [7], an undecapeptide (Cyclosporin H) derived from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum\n[8], and peptides derived from murine leukemia virus and human T cell leukemia virus [9]. A peptide derived from herpes simplex virus type 2 elicited chemotaxis and superoxide production in neutrophils in a process that appeared to involve FPR [10]. Thus FPR appears to interact with peptides derived from a variety of sources.",

No polymorphisms were found in the closely related receptor FPRL1 [13]. One possible reason for the existence of polymorphisms is that polymorphisms might prevent pathogens from binding to receptors and using them as an entry point into cells. Several G protein-coupled receptors have been used by pathogens as a point of entry into cells and the use of CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors for HIV-1 and CXCR4 as a co-receptor for FIV are notable examples [14], [15], [16]. The CCR5 receptor in African green monkeys [17] has been shown to be polymorphic and these polymorphisms provide some protection against SIV infection.",

They also found that aggressive periodontitis patients of African American decent were much less likely (P\n = 0.003) to have one of their alleles as the W190/N192 polymorphism. R190/K192 was not associated with an increased risk of aggressive periodontitis among either Brazilians or Turks nor was W190/N192 associated with reduced incidence of aggressive periodontal disease in these two populations [24]. It is unclear at this point why FPR W190/R190 and N192/K192 are only associated with altered risk of aggressive periodontitis in African Americans but the effects of these polymorphisms on receptor function clearly needs to be determined.",

In order to determine whether polymorphisms W190 or K192 might similarly affect ligand binding and possibly explain why K192 is associated with an increased risk of periodontal disease and W190 is associated with reduced risk of disease, we expressed R190/N192, W190/N192, and R190/N192 FPR variants in CHO S cells and determined their affinity for numerous ligands, including several formyl peptides and peptides derived from HIV-1 gp-41 and analogous peptides derived from HIV-2, SARS coronavirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus OC43, and Ebola virus.",

Since gp41 is a fusion glycoprotein which contains two heptad repeat regions, we chose viral glycoproteins with this property. T20/DP178 is derived from the second heptad repeat region of HIV-1 gp41 but also includes residues C-terminal to the end of the heptad 2 repeat region [28]. Sainz et al. called these residues in HIV-1 and SARS coronavirus the \u201caromatic rich region\u201d and they noted a similar region in Ebola virus [29]. This region has also been called the membrane proximal region. We therefore chose to synthesize peptides from HIV-2 and several human coronaviruses (SARS, OC43, and 229E) that corresponded to T20/DP178 in HIV-1. An alignment of sequences is shown in Table 1\n, which also includes the newly discovered coronaviruses HKU-1 and NL-63 [30], [31], [32] and the aromatic rich region from the Ebola spike protein.",

The location of R/W 190 and N/K 192 at the extracellular loop 2\u2013TMH5 interface is indicated in the figure. Residues that have been shown in previous crosslinking and mutagenesis studies to be important in ligand binding are V83 (TMH2), R84 (TMH2), K85 (TMH2) [35]; L78A (TMH2), D106N (TMH3), L109A (TMH3), T157A (TMH4), R201A (TMH5), I204Y (TMH5), R205A (TMH2), W254A (TMH6), Y257A (TMH6) and F291A (TMH7) [26]. D106 and R201 are the sites of formyl group binding and R205 interacts with the C-terminus of fMLF [25]. The beginning of TMH5 was assigned to residue 191 and the end to residue 228 by hydrophobicity analysis according to Kyte and Doolittle [36]. We analyzed CHO S cells expressing R190/N192, W190/N192, and R190/K192 FPR for their ability to bind formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013FITC. We observed that the polymorphisms in FPR result in significantly altered formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013FITC binding affinity (Fig. 2\n) with R190/K192 having the highest affinity (K\nd\n = 0.71 \u00b1 0.10 nM), R190/N192 intermediate (K\nd\n = 1.06 \u00b1 0.09 nM), and W190/N192 having the lowest affinity (K\nd\n = 1.68 \u00b1 0.13 nM); P\n = 0.02; R190/N192 vs. R190/K192 : P\n = 0.001; R190/N192 vs. W190/N192, and P\n < 0.0001 R190/K192 vs. W190/N192, respectively). We also synthesized formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor and determined the K\nds: R190/K192 (K\nd\n = 0.76 \u00b1 0.05 nM), R190/N192 (K\nd\n = 1.20 \u00b1 0.14 nM), and W190/N192 (K\nd\n = 2.0 \u00b1 0.10 nM), the results being essentially identical as that observed with formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013FITC.

Both formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe and MMWLL bound with \u223c3 fold higher affinities to R190/K192 than to W190/N192. W190/N192 had the highest affinity for most virally derived peptides, especially the coronavirus peptides. W190/N192 bound the SARS coronavirus peptides with 4\u20136 fold higher affinity than either R190/N192 or R190/K192. This indicates that changes in these two positions affected ligand specificity, but most of the change in specificity was associated with the R to W change at residue 190. Most of the binding affinity of the coronavirus 229E peptides appears to reside in the 5 C-terminal residues since WWVWL exhibited only a modest reduction in affinity compared to ETYIKWPWWVWL. ETYIKWP was completely devoid of activity. WPWWVWL had similar affinity to WWVWL. ETYIKWPWWVWL bound to all three FPR variants with 15 to 30 fold higher affinity than the HIV-2 12 mer (KLNSWDVFGNWF) indicating a preference of coronavirus peptides over HIV-2 peptides. The reverse peptide, LWVWWPWKIYTE, exhibited very little inhibition at concentrations up to 40,000 nM. Formylation of MYVKWPWYVWL enhanced its affinity 6 fold for both R190/N192 and R190/K192 but had only a very modest 2 fold affect on affinity for W190/N192.",

The EC50s for internalization were \u223c4 fold lower than the K\nd for binding (R190/N192, R190/K192, and W190/N192; 29 \u00b1 5 nM, 27 \u00b1 8 nM, and 20 \u00b1 3 nM, respectively). This indicates that either the affinity of ETYIK-(Alexa Fluor)WPWWVWL for FPR is greater at 37 \u00b0C used for internalization than at 4 \u00b0C used in the binding experiments to prevent internalization or that saturation of the internalization process occurs at concentrations well below those required for receptor saturation. Since the peptides behaved as antagonists, we were somewhat surprised that they were so readily internalized. This probably reflects turnover of FPR on the cell surface, since treatment of the cells with ETYIKWPWWVWL did not result in net receptor down regulation (see Fig. 9) below. Nonetheless, it indicates that if a virus interacts with FPR, it could be effectively internalized even if it is unable to activate the receptor.",

Interestingly, formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor fluorescence internalized by W190/N192 FPR was enhanced in the presence of 0.1% SDS by 95 \u00b1 5%, but 0.1% SDS did not affect the fluorescence of formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor internalized by either R190/N192 FPR or R190/K192 FPR.

This indicates that W190 resides in or very close to the ligand binding pocket (\u223c1 to 1.5 nm average distance [38]). Since Alexa Fluor-ETYIKWPWWVWL exhibited twice the fluorescence of formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor when bound to W190/N192 (the expected value if it was not quenched), it is unlikely that W190 can come in contact with the Alexa Fluor of ETYIK-(Alexa Fluor)WPWWVW when bound to FPR. After correcting for the quenching of formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor on W190/N192, we estimate that ETYIK-(Alexa Fluor)WPWWVW is internalized at about 20\u201330% of the rate of formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor in R190/N192, R190/K192, and W190/N192, based on their relative internalization rates by FACScan. This level of internalization was too low to accurately quantitate by direct fluorescence readings so the degree of quenching of Alexa Fluor- ETYIKWPWWVWL could only be estimated by FACScan analysis.",

Both 300 nM formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe and 300 nM formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL stimulated GTP\u03b3S binding in all three FPR variants, but neither ETYIKWPWWVWL nor MYVKWPWYVWL had any effect on the three FPR variants (Fig. 5\n). This indicated that the formyl group on formyl- MYVKWPWYVWL was essential for agonist activity but not for binding. 2 \u03bcM MYVKWPWYVWL inhibited 300 nM formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding by W190/N192 FPR by 60% but did not have a significant effect on formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding in either R190/N192 FPR or R190/K192 FPR. This is consistent with the data in Table 2 where formylation of MYVKWPWYVWL enhanced the affinity for R190/N192 and R190/K192 by 6 fold but only 2 fold for W190/N192. We then tested ETYIKWPWWVWL for its ability to inhibit the stimulation of GTP\u03b3S by 300 nM formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe (Fig. 6\n). ETYIKWPWWVWL was more effective in inhibiting the stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding in W190/N192 (EC50\n = 300 \u00b1 120 nM; (P\n = 0.003 vs. R190/K192; P\n = 0.005 vs. R190/N192)) than either R190/N192 (EC50\n = 1600 \u00b1 400 nM) or R190/K192 (EC50\n = 1600 \u00b1 440 nM). These results are consistent with the results in Table 2, which show that W190/N192 has a similar affinity for formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe and ETYIKWPWWVWL but that R190/N192 and R190/K192 have 6\u20138 fold higher affinities for formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe than ETYIKWPWWVWL. We also tested ETYIKWP and WWVWL for their ability to inhibit the stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding by 300 nM formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe in W190/N192 FPR. The results are shown in Fig. 7\n. WWVWL inhibited formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding with a slightly higher EC50 (EC50\n = 1300 nM) than ETYIKWPWWVWL (EC50\n = 300 \u00b1 120 nM). ETYIKWP had no effect. Again this is consistent with the results shown in Table 2. We also tested the HIV-1 36 mer and the Ebola virus 12 mer for their effects on GTP\u03b3S binding. As observed with ETYIKWPWWVWL, neither peptide at 10 \u03bcM stimulated GTP\u03b3S binding but both peptides at 10 \u03bcM markedly inhibited the stimulation by 300 nM formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe (data not shown).",

Zhang et al. also reported that R190/K192 was not associated with an increased risk of aggressive periodontitis among either Brazilians or Turks nor was W190/N192 associated with reduced incidence of aggressive periodontal disease in these two populations [24] so it was unclear why this association was only true for African Americans. A recent study by Maney et al.

We previously determined that D106 and R201 likely form an ion pair between TMH3 and TMH5 and that this ion pair imparts formyl group selectivity to ligand binding since mutation of either residue changes the preference of formylated to non-formylated peptide from 4000/1 to \u223c 1/3 and 1/1, respectively, for D106N and R201A [25]. Here we observe that W190 is likely to be close to the lys residue of formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor since quenching of the Alexa Fluor fluorophore is observed only in W190/N192 and not in either R190/N192 or R190/K192. It is likely therefore that when bound, formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013Alexa Fluor is in a somewhat helical conformation (it contains residues with high helical propensity) with the formyl group near R201 and the AlexFluor moiety near W190 and presumably near R190 as well. This mode of binding is different from that proposed for fMLF where the C-terminus of fMLF interacts with R205 [25]. This is consistent with our previous observations that mutation of R205 to A results in a 1000 fold reduction of affinity to fMLF [25] but only an 8 fold reduction in affinity for formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe\u2013Nle\u2013Tyr\u2013Lys\u2013FITC [26]. Given that W190/N192 binds coronaviral peptides better than R190/N192 or R190/K192, it is likely that W190 interacts with some as yet unidentified residues in these peptides. One explanation of why R190/K192 binds formyl peptides better than W190/N192 is that the former contains two additional positive charges. Formylation removes the positive charge from the N-terminus of peptides. If R190 is near the entry site of the ligand, the positive charge would repel peptides with free N-termini but allow entry of formylated ones. Since formyl-Nle\u2013Leu\u2013Phe has a net negative charge, it would be attracted toward R190 but not W190. W190 would be expected to exhibit a relative preference for peptides with free N-termini and peptides with net positive charges compared to R190. This is consistent with our observation that MYVKWPWYVWL exhibits a 3 fold higher affinity for W190/N192 than for R190/N192 or R190/K192 and that formylation of MYVKWPWYVWL enhances its affinity 6 fold with R190/N192 and R190/K192 but only 2 fold with W190/N192. Formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL has a net charge of zero, and it binds equally well to all three variants.",

We subsequently showed that DP178 binds to FPR expressed in CHO S cells and observed that two FPR mutants (D106N and R201A), which bind fMLF poorly, exhibited an enhanced ability (30 fold and 3 fold, respectively) to bind DP178/T20 [25].

They exist as sequential helical domains; one n terminal HR region (HR1) adjacent to the fusion peptide and a c-terminal HR region (HR2) close to the transmembrane anchor. Peptides derived from the HR2 and proximal membrane regions of HIV-1, SIV, HRSV, human parainfluenza virus type 3, measles virus, and a coronavirus have all been shown to be able to block virus infection [28], [46], [47], [48]. A twelve mer peptide derived from the proximal membrane region of FIV gp41, QLQKWEDWVRWI, was a potent (low nanomolar) inhibiter of FIV infection [49]. Here we observed that peptides derived from the proximal membrane region of HIV-1, HIV-2, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, and coronavirus 229E act as antagonists to the formyl peptide receptor. The coronavirus peptides are the most potent antagonists and these peptides exhibited an enhanced affinity for W190/N192 FPR. Our observation that tryptophan-rich peptides act as antagonists is consistent with the observation of Bae et al., who observed that WRWWWW was a potent antagonist for FPRL1 and FPRL2 [50], [51]. WRWWWW did not affect FPR [50], and it has been shown that DP178/T20 does not bind to FPRL1 [4], indicating that these receptors have slightly different ligand binding specificities but that both receptors may bind tryptophan rich peptides. A recently discovered FPRL2 agonist is also tryptophan rich [52] and the C-terminus of that peptide, WPWQVL, is remarkably similar to WPWWVWL which we found to be a potent antagonist for FPR. The FPRL2 agonist did not, however, bind to or activate FPR.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are common infections among the human population [53], [54] and as such might affect the evolution of FPR if they were able to attach to FPR, become internalized, and spread through the body on the many cells that express FPR [55]. On the other hand, it is possible that FPR's ability to bind virally derived peptides allows it in some way to recognize the presence of a viral infection and inhibit its spread. A recent report showed that HIV-1 viruses are inactivated by transport to acidic endosomes and proteosomes and that blocking these processes can increase HIV-1 infectivity by up to 400 fold [56]. If FPR could bind viruses and transport them to endosomes and proteosomes, this might result in protection against viral infection. Another possibility is that FPR could serve as a \u201cfly-trap\u201d for viruses and prevent them from finding their appropriate receptor. Also, FPR might interact with the aromatic rich region subsequent to virus binding to a surface receptor and prevent membrane fusion. The scenarios are not of course mutually exclusive and the binding of viruses to FPR could have positive or negative consequences depending on the exact situation. Klestadt et al. [57] observed that activation of FPR in THP-1 cells markedly downregulated the expression of CD4 and CD13, the receptors for HIV-1/HIV-2 and coronavirus 229E, respectively [11], [58], [59]. In addition, activation of FPR downregulates the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 [60], the co-receptors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 [9], [58]. Thus activation of FPR could serve as protection against viral infection by downregulation of viral receptors, and presumably FPR antagonists would prevent downregulation. Ueda et al. noted that the HIV-1 envelope gp41 was able to down regulate the expression of FPR and other chemokine receptors at low nanomolar concentrations, but that the downregulation of FPR and the chemokine receptors was dependent upon expression of CD4 [61]. Thus, there are a complicated set of interactions between FPR and the receptors and co-receptors of viruses, and FPR may play an important role in viral infections.",
