Similarly, SSA countries could take advantage of the large number of existing GeneXpert\u00ae tools, located at both central and peripheral laboratories. GeneXpert\u00ae is a multi\u2010disease diagnostic platform used initially to test TB and later adapted for HIV and Ebola. The GxAlert, a web\u2010based data management system associated to GeneXpert\u00ae, allows automatic transfer of test results from the diagnostic device to the GxAlert web server. This avoids delays in notifications and helps to monitor testing in the whole country, two key aspects for successful containment of an emerging infectious outbreak. As of March 21, thanks to an emergency approval by the US FDA, GeneXpert Xpress SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 cartridges are available on the market. If properly rolled out, such technology will allow to decentralize SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 testing and provide results in less than 45 min with minimal staff training. On the other hand, the implementation of GeneXpert presents major challenges, particularly related to cost and infrastructure. The price of GeneXpert equipment and cartridges had been an undeniable barrier for scaling up this technology in many LMICs and could be a major problem during the current pandemic.",

ACE2 is involved in the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) that regulates blood pressure and is expressed in epithelial cells of the lung and other organs. ACE\u2010inhibitors, commonly prescribed blood\u2010pressure drugs, are less effective in African Americans compared with Caucasians, which has been linked to genetic predisposition of African Americans to higher baseline RAAS activity with increased susceptibility to salt retention rather than to the ACE protein itself (Spence & Rayner, 2018). There are limited data associating genetic background to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pathogenicity and no evidence so far of ACE2 polymorphisms that confer resistance to viral infection. Recent single\u2010cell RNA\u2010sequencing expression data (preprint: Zhao et al, 2020), although limited in the numbers of donors analyzed, noticed that lung tissue from an Asian male had significantly higher ACE2\u2010expressing cell content than Caucasian or African American donors.
