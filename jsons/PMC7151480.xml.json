Confirmed cases in the United States as of April 1, 2020 have exceeded 200,000 with more than 4400 deaths as per the online virus tracker created by The Lancet, and hosted by John Hopkins University.4 Common clinical symptoms of patients infected with COVID-19, include fever, fatigue, dry cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea. In severe cases, patients present with dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia 1 week after the onset of the disease, and rapidly deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation abnormalities.5 Cheng et al found that there was no statistical difference in clinical features in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and those with non-COVID-19 infection except for leukocyte and platelet counts. Patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results had lower median leukocyte and platelet counts than those with negative results.6 Although viral nucleic acid detection using RT-PCR remains the gold standard of diagnosis, imaging may play a vital role in reinforcing the diagnosis, can assess disease progression, and identify complications that may need additional procedures or changes in management. This case series aims to outline the clinical features, illustrates the most common reported imaging findings of COVID-19 infection, and demonstrates different management plans used.",

It is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses infecting humans, along with the zoonoses middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).1 The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a global health emergency, with morbidity and mortality exceeding the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012. Despite radiologic similarities to SARS and MERS pneumonia, significantly fewer number of patients with COVID-19 infection have abnormalities on the initial CXR.7, 8, 9 CXRs remain the initial imaging tool of choice but have a limited role in the diagnosis of disease. Wong et al found that consolidation was the most common finding on CXRs in COVID-19 patients with a peripheral, lower zone predominance.10 The variety of the findings in COVID-19 have been categorized in the consensus documents from American College of Radiology/Society of Thoracic Radiology /Radiological Society of North America Radiology as typical, indeterminate and atypical features, and negative for pneumonia.11 The typical features are peripheral bilateral GGOs, rounded GGOs, and reverse halo sign of organizing pneumonia. Indeterminate features include multifocal, diffuse, perihilar, or unilateral GGOs with nonrounded, nonperipheral distribution. Atypical features include isolated consolidations, tree-in-bud opacities, cavitation, and smooth interlobular septal thickening with pleural effusion. CT can be used to better assess the extent of disease, identify complications and monitor treatment response.12 In the early stages of the disease, the abnormalities on CT are localized to the subpleural or peribronchovascular regions of one or both lungs, and manifest as pure GGOs with or without vascular enlargement.13 Disease progression is associated with increasing GGOs, and multilobar involvement.14 Progression to bilateral consolidations is often seen in hospitalized patients,15 due to the development of ARDS. Interlobular septal thickening, crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchograms are common. Pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rarely seen and most likely favor alternative etiologies.",

Two of the 8 patients expired from respiratory issues, and the remaining individuals are responding to treatment. Associated comorbidities were present in more than half of the patients. Leukocytosis was seen in only 1 of the 8 patients in our series. One of the 8 patients experienced a loss of sense of smell and taste, which has been anecdotally reported in literature with COVID-19 infection worldwide. In addition to the commonly reported imaging manifestations (Table 2\n), which include patchy peripheral GGOs with lower lobe predominance, we encountered one patient with a pneumothorax, and asymmetric involvement at initial presentation. Pattern of GGOs and consolidative opacities seen in COVID-19 patients can mimic those of other viral pneumonias, particularly influenza, and organizing pneumonia due to other causes such as bacterial infection, drug toxicity, inhalation injury, connective tissue disease, and idiopathic. Imaging features can also be seen synchronously with chronic abnormalities like granulomatous disease or malignancies.16 This case series hopefully adds to the knowledge base that is evolving and helps in the understanding of this relatively new and unknown viral pandemic.",
