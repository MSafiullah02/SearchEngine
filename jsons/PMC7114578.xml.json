Administrative Matters were analysed only quantitatively in this study. Other agenda items besides Administrative Matters were labelled as Technical & Health Matters. Then, we classified Technical & Health Matters into two groups: Health Matters and Progress Reports. Here, Progress Reports are follow-ups of the previous WHA agenda items, usually responding to the requests of previous resolutions adopted by the WHA in the past.

Categories were drawn from one of the 65th WHA agendas entitled \u201cWHO reform\u201d [11]. The five categories are (1) communicable diseases, (2) noncommunicable diseases, (3) health through the life course, (4) health systems, and (5) preparedness, surveillance and response. We added another category, (6) others, for agenda items which did not fit in these five categories. The sub-categories were developed with reference to the Handbook of Resolutions and Decisions of the World Health Assembly and Executive Board, Volumes I, II, and III\n[12], [13], [14], and also in light of the functions of the WHO according to its Constitution, Article 2 [1]. In this labelling system, the health systems category includes items related to health policies, such as PHC, health for all by 2000, and MDGs, since health systems are strongly connected to the health policies. The sub-category \u2018Strengthening health systems\u2019 was defined according to the concept provided by the WHO in the Everybody's Business: Strengthening health systems to Improve Health Outcomes, WHO's Framework of Action\n[15]. The noncommunicable diseases category consists of 10 subcategories. One of them that includes the agendas entitled \u201cprevention and control of noncommunicable diseases\u201d or similar titles, was named as \u201cnoncommunicable diseases in general\u201d to avoid any confusion between category and subcategory. Health issue milestones in the each category were selected from several publications and web sites [16], [17], [18], [19].",

The other sub-categories shown in Table 1 were summarized as \u201cothers\u201d in this figure. For the category of communicable diseases, the agenda item of smallpox was mainly discussed in the 1970s in order to eradicate the disease. This topic was then discussed after 1996 for destruction of variola virus stocks. The agenda of HIV/AIDS was started to be discussed from 1986 and frequently discussed after 2000. It corresponded with the period of accelerated response to HIV/AIDS such as UN Security Council discussed the effect of AIDS on peace and security in 2000 and the founding of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2002. For the category of noncommunicable diseases, the sub-category of noncommunicable diseases in general was discussed in 1998 and 2000 and frequently discussed after 2007. These discussions led to the United Nations General Assembly holding a High Level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases. In the category of health through the life course, the agenda titled maternal and child health (MCH) including newborn health was discussed only three times in 1979, 1992 and 2007, even though there had been some important milestones such as the Safe motherhood initiative in 1987, International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994, the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health in 2005 (PMNCH) and UN MDG summit in 2010. For the category of Health systems, after the Alma-Ata Declaration in 1978, agenda items relating to health for all were discussed 18 times between 1979 and 1998. After 2000, the agenda items related to strengthening health systems and MDGs were discussed 19 and 9 times, respectively. The result indicated a shift in the major health issues from health for all based on PHC to strengthening health systems and MDGs after the UN Millennium Summit in 2000. After 2003, for the category of preparedness, surveillance and response, influenza and IHR were discussed 10 times and 8 times, respectively.

Even when there were no Health Matters in the WHA in 1985, WHO documentation mentioned that Technical Discussions entitled Collaboration with Non-Governmental Organizations in Implementing the Global Strategy for health for all seemed to have taken place separately from the Agenda in the WHA (WHA38/1985/REC/2). Having many debates between selective and comprehensive PHC as well as considerable obstacles to progress towards health for all [20], [21], [22], the WHA in 1995 stressed the continued validity of health for all as a timeless aspirational goal and agreed that a new global health policy should be elaborated [23]. Thus, the Alma-Ata Declaration provided the revolutionary principles of health throughout the world in 1978 [24], and WHA adopted the Global Strategy for Health for All by the year 2000 in 1981 [25], which seemed to affect the number of WHA agenda items from the 1980s to mid-1990s.

In this sub-category, the WHO has mainly focused on the breast milk issue, which led to the International Code on Marketing of Breast Milk Substitute (hereafter referred to as the Code) adopted in 1981. The objective of the Code was to restrict advertising of formula milk aiming to eliminate the negative impact on babies of formula milk, especially in the developing world. Within three years of its adoption, 130 countries had taken action by passing legislation or formulating policies to restrict advertising [28]. However, the formula milk industry continued to undermine the Code [29], [30], [31]. As Forsyth pointed out, it was not uncommon that a formula-milk company located in one country may violate the Code regulations in another country [32]. This must be a challenge for future WHA resolutions. Although MCH including newborn health is tremendously important [33], [34], there were only three Health Matters related to MCH, including newborn health, in 1979, 1992 and 2007. It seems to be imbalanced agenda setting compared with the burdens of mortality and illness of infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases [35], [36], [37].",

On the other hand, maternal conditions (DALY 2.6), perinatal conditions (DALY 8.3), neuropsychiatric disorders (DALY 13.1), and road safety (DALY 2.7) have high burdens of disease and injuries, but were not frequently discussed at the WHA. Meanwhile, there are many agenda items which do not have DALY. The WHA also should not overlook other important health issues such as potable water, climate change, healthy ageing, occupational health, which are not frequently discussed, while appropriate measures are not available to assess the burdens of their risks.",

This ties up with the recent attentions on the diseases and leads to the United Nations High Level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases [40]. It indicates that the WHA discussed the important agenda item which has great disease burden before any other major health organization may decide to do so. Regarding the IHR, WHA had frequently discussed and revised it as IHR (2005), which could respond timely the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and health risks and emergencies [41], [42].",

Recognizing that the numbers of the agenda items do not directly reflect the weight of health issues, we selected a simple and clear way to compare the number of the agenda items in this analysis. Second, we did not focus on the resolutions, but on the agenda items of the WHA. Since a resolution was not always adopted from each agenda item, we decided to use the agenda items to analyse the trends and characteristics of international health issues. Third, we did not analyse WHO budgetary allocations relating to the WHA agenda items in this study. Stuckler et al. [43] noted that WHO biennial budget allocations from 1994\u20131995 to 2008\u20132009 were heavily skewed towards infectious diseases. Our data indicated that the WHA agenda items for the Communicable diseases from 1994 to 2009 accounted for 61 out of 196 Health Matters (31.1%). Further studies about the resolutions and budgetary allocations would be our future challenge. Finally, we utilized the five categories from the WHO reform in the 65th WHA. Since the new categories are created for the WHO's priority setting and programmes, each category in our study includes a limited number of health issues based on that priority [11]. Thus, 82 agenda items were classified into others in our analysis. However, we believe that our analysis will help to consider the WHO reform and which agenda items should be discussed in the future WHA.",

Among the five categories of the WHO reform, communicable diseases was the most discussed, followed by health systems, but health through the life course was relatively small compared with the other categories. Among the sub-categories, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases in general, health for all, MDGs, influenza, and IHR discussed frequently and appeared associated with the public health milestones. The fact that the number of noncommunicable diseases in general as sub-category increased after 2007 deserves attention. However, the agenda items of the WHA do not always reflect international health issues in terms of burdens of mortality and illness, such as MCH including newborn health. Most of the WHA agenda items are decided by the Executive Board meeting every January. Therefore, reflecting from the number and the trend of the WHA agenda items, Member States and Associate Members of WHO should take more respective and responsive roles in setting agenda items to attain the highest possible level of health for all.",
