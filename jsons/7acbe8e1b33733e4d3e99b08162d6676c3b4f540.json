The graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) is a very powerful and flexible methodology which can be employed for modeling and analyzing tough conflict situations [1] [2] [3] . In the modeling stage, the DMs, their options, feasible states and each DM's preference over states should be identified according to the background information about a particular conflict. The preference of DMs is very important in stability analysis but difficult to be determined due to the diversity of individual value systems. Three preference ranking methods were developed by Fang et al. [4, 5] within the framework of GMCR for conveniently acquiring DMs' preference over states: direct ranking, option weighting and option prioritization.",

Similarly, one can continue to calculate the option statement reducts for UR and LG. By using the Rosetta software, {3 IFF1, \u22125, 2 IFF\u22125} is the reduct for UR's option statements {3 IFF1, \u22124, \u22125, 2 IFF\u2212 5}. And the ranking of states for UR under the option statement reduct is s 1 1 s 4 1 s 8 $ s 9 1 s 5 1 s 2 1 s 3 1 s 7 1 s 6 , which is not equal to the initial preference of UR. Hence, there are no redundant option statements of UR. For LG's option statements {\u22124, \u22121, 3IF\u22121, 5IF1, \u22122, 5}, one can find that there are two reducts: {\u22124, \u22121, \u22122, 5} and {\u22124, 3IF\u22121, \u22122, 5}. But only the first reduct can generate the preference ranking list which is equal to LG's initial ranking of states. Hence, {\u22124, \u22121, \u22122, 5}is",
