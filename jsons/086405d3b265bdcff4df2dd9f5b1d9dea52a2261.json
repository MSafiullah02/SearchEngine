Objective: To determine whether a higher prevalence or viral load for WUPyV and KIPyV exists in immunocompromised children compared with immunocompetent children. Study design: We measured the prevalence and viral load of WU and KI PyV by quantitative real-time PCR of viral DNA in respiratory tract specimens from pediatric hematology/oncology patients and immunocompetent controls with acute respiratory illnesses. Results: The prevalence of WUPyV in the immunocompromised population was 5/161 (3%) versus 14/295 (5%) in the control population (P = 0.5), and 9/161 (5.6%) versus 7/295 (2.3%) respectively for KIPyV (P = 0.13). The mean viral load (in copies per cell or mL of sample) for KIPyV, was higher in the immunocompromised group compared to the control group (P = 0.019), but was not statistically different for WUPyV. A higher prevalence was seen in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients compared with other immunocompromised patients (6/26 versus 3/43, P = 0.054). Viral persistence was demonstrated only in 1/25 (4%) of sequential samples for KIPyV, and no persistence was seen for WUPyV.

However, our study is the first to measure the viral loads of WUPyV and KIPyV in respiratory secretions, in an attempt to differentiate their pathology in immunologically distinct patient populations. Viral loads were measured as copies per mL as well as copies per cell, in order to account for the high degree of variability in viral load among respiratory samples depending on sample collection methods and sites of collection. The lack of viral detection in sequential specimens may reflect this non-standardized collection of specimens, rather than a lack of viral persistence, and is one limitation of the study. Inclusion of samples from different sites of the respiratory tract likely contributed to the variability in viral load, but ensured a wider spectrum of disease presentations, given that more ill patients are more likely to have bronchoalveolar lavages and tracheal aspirates. Viral load measurements have been shown to be a helpful tool in analyzing some respiratory viruses (such as RSV 9 and human bocavirus 10 ) but not for others such as rhinovirus. 11 Higher viral loads for KIPyV in our immunosuppressed group suggest increased pathogenic potential in this population.
