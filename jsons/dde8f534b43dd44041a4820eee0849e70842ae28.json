Moreover, the rate of positivity in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, in congruence with the epidemiological trend estimated for the interested provinces. Virus infectiveness was always not significant, indicating the effectiveness of wastewater treatments, or the natural decay of viral vitality, which implied the absence of significant risk of infection from wastewaters. Samples from receiving rivers (two sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to PCR amplification, probably due to non-treated discharges, or the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers vitality was negligible, indicating the absence of sanitary risks. Phylogenetic analysis of genome indicated that the isolated virus belongs to the most spread strain present in Europe and similar to another strain found in Lombardy.",

This emergency saw an unprecedented investment of energies and resources by the scientific community to rapidly contains the spread of the virus. Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 circulation and real time trend monitoring were advocated as key actions to activate pandemic responses. The high rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (Al-Tawfiq, 2020) has challenged the estimation of infection spread basing on survey on ill patients, and alternative approaches, such as wastewater-based epidemiology, were proposed (Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020) . Since SARS-CoV-2 duration in faecal samples of infected patients is supposed to be high (Gupta et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) , the identification and quantification of viral RNA in raw wastewater (WW) could be a reliable marker of infection prevalence in the population indeed, as demonstrated for other viruses (Hovi et al., 2012; Wigginton et al., 2015) .",

The northern part of Italy has reported the prevalence of Italian cases. In particular the Milano Metropolitan Area, including the Province of Milano and Monza/Brianza with 18'559 and 4'516 cases, respectively, experienced an infection rate (case divided by resident population) almost double (0.58 and 0.52%, respectively) respect to the rest of Italy (0.32%) (https://github.com/pcmdpc/ . In the present study, we evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw and treated WWs collected in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), covering the entire Milano Metropolitan Area, including the northeastern densely inhabited productive area and the Milano urban centre. The main aims of this survey were: 1) evaluating the effectiveness of WWTPs in reducing or eliminating the viral load, after checking for the presence of SARS-CoV viral RNA in WWs; 2) testing for virus vitality before and after WWTPs, in relation to the intrinsic persistence of SARS-CoV-2; 3) comparing genomic strains of SARS_CoV2 found in WWs to those isolated from ill patients in the area and worldwide; 4) checking for the presence of SARS-CoV viral RNA in rivers downstream the Milano Metropolitan Area.",

Both Provinces recorded the same magnitude of relative daily new diagnosed cases and similar trends. The infection started to increase since the end of February, 2020, reached a maximum in the second half of March, 2020, and then has slowly decreased. These epidemiological data need standardized collection methods (Sims and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2020) and in Italy are probably affected by unequal sampling efforts and asynchrony of records respect to the real infection dates. Hence, temporal correlation between wastewater-based and clinical epidemiology can be hampered by these factors. However, in this study amplification data are congruent with the main falling trend of the epidemic event, suggesting that wastewater-based epidemiology could be a feasible approach in monitoring the diffusion and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Mallapaty, 2020) . It is worth of mention that, at this purpose, more sensitive quantitative approaches (i.e., quantitative PCR on concentrated viral samples) should be tuned.",

Enveloped virus are more susceptible to decay of their infectiveness in wastewaters than non enveloped viruses (Ye et al., 2016) , especially when in presence of free active enzymes activity or predators like protozoan or metazoan (Kim and Unno, 1996) . Survival of coronaviruses, or enveloped viruses, in wastewaters is also dependent on temperature, being around 7-13 h, but higher in some conditions, at mild temperature (23-25\u00b0C) and longer in colder conditions (36 h at 10\u00b0C) (Casanova et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2016) . In the present case-study, the time from faeces emission to the arrival at the WWTP has been estimated to be about 6-8 hours according to the mean corrivation times of WWs provided by the WWST managers. Climatic conditions were mild (15-20\u00b0C) in the weeks of sampling activities, and probably did not favour the survival of SARS-CoV-2 up to the WWTPs. A few studies have .

Any speculation about the role of wastewater treatments in reducing the viral concentration, respect to the natural decay of virus load in the WWTPs, cannot be advanced at this stage. At this regard, specific analysis targeting the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WWs under different environmental conditions are ongoing. Public concern for potential infection risk due to accidental contacts with WWs (e.g., airborne aerosols and droplets) seems to be negligible in the case of the investigated WWTPs. From the environmental point of view, WWTPs should not constitute a significant source of infective SARS-CoV-2.",

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rivers in spite of the absence in treated WWs of the analysed plants probably indicates that an aliquot of nontreated WWs was present in the surface waters, and this situation was exacerbated in the sampling period characterised by an anomalous and prolonged drought (Bollettino Idrologico Arpa Lombardia, 2020). The explanations could be the presence of non-collected domestic discharges or the lack of separation of the urban runoff waters from the domestic effluents, which causes combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The latter possible source of contamination is common to the central Europe, with approximately 70% of combined sewer systems (Butler and Davies, 2004) during high precipitation events in order to prevent damages on the WWTPs. However, even during prolonged drought, some CSO devices can be active due to possible failures of the sewerage system (Salerno et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, all the possible sources should be investigated by using anthropogenic substances, such as e.g. caffeine, which are specific tracers of untreated domestic sewages (Viviano et al., 2017) .",
