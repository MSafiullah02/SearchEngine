Moreover, these endophytes could efficiently execute this spectacular attribution of plant growth enhancement via certain important interrelated mechanisms like phytostimulation, phytoimmobilization, phytostabilization, phytotransformation, phytovolatilization, phytofilterastion, biofertilization and biocontrol (Conesa et al. 2012) . Phytostimulation is a direct manifestation of plant growth promotion through the up-regulation of phytohormones directly or indirectly (Bloemberg and Lugtenberg 2001) . Likewise, phytoimmobilization is another remediation technology where contaminants are effectually removed by the means of plants, the intake and sequential release into the soil is further followed by immobilization in either a mineralemended soil or a geomate commonly known as mineral-containingmat (Arthur et al. 2005) . Removal of the contaminants from the location is quite sophisticated therefore stabilization provides another important and effective mode of technical amelioration strategy adapted by nature for self-sustenance (Perez-de-Mora et al. 2011). Together phytoimmobilization and phytostabilization leads to phytotransformation or otherwise known as phytodegradation (sequestration and/or compartmentalization) phytocompounds involve the transformation or deterioration of intricate organic molecules into unadorned or simple molecular form that could be further absorbed into plant tissue in necessary (Etim 2012) . The efficient degradation of contaminants or the xenobiotics, the subsequent release is sometimes regarded as phytoextraction/phytovolatilization where they are efficiently removed out of the plant system into the atmosphere (Limmer and Burken 2016) . Phytofiltration is a fascinating scheme tailored by the plants where, with the help of certain surface anchorage phytocompounds, contaminants or nutrients are either absorbed/bound to the nonliving part of the plant (biosorptation), or to the root (Rhizofiltration), or to the seedlings (Blastofiltration) (Conesa et al. 2012) . Though there is tremendous advantage in the usage of this phenomenon for the agricultural remediation but till date the advancement of research in the field is scanty. Biofertilazation on the other hand is one of the most growing, demanding, advanced and widely researched area of agriculture and environmental science. It is a technique where living microorganisms effectively aggrandize the nutrients and mineral uptake of the plants by means of establishing a symbiotic relationship with the plant and simultaneously sustains the dynamic nature of the soil (Roychowdhury et al. 2017) . And finally, the protection of plant from pathogens before or after the harvest by the help of endophytic microbes is another growing sector of agricultural research where the endophytes produce a bioactive compound or induces the host plant to produce a specific and/ or a group of phytoactive compound that inhibits the growth and survivability of the pathogens (Eljounaidi et al. 2016; Shahzad et al. 2017 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 154, "text": "(Santoyo et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 470, "end": 490, "text": "(Conesa et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 628, "end": 659, "text": "(Bloemberg and Lugtenberg 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 964, "end": 984, "text": "(Arthur et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1595, "text": "(Etim 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1847, "text": "(Limmer and Burken 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2176, "text": "(Conesa et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2739, "end": 2765, "text": "(Roychowdhury et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 3132, "end": 3156, "text": "(Eljounaidi et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3157, "end": 3176, "text": "Shahzad et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Plant Growth Promotion by Endophytes"}, {"text": "The method of removal of wastes and hazardous pollutants from the environment employing micro-organisms is known as bioremediation.

But in some case the modulation of these phytohormones or other bioactive phytocompounds is induced by biotic factors living within the plant in a symbiotic relation as endophytes. These endophytes or endo-rhizosphers are currently been exploited for their capacity to produce exopolysaccharides, growth hormones (Indole-3-acetic acid), phyto-enzymes (1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid [ACC] deaminase), volatile compounds, osmoregulatory hormone and antioxidants (Table 19 .4) (Vurukonda et al. 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 868, "end": 891, "text": "(Vurukonda et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 854, "end": 863, "text": "(Table 19", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Phytostimulation"}, {"text": "Phytohormones such as auxins, cytokinins and gibberellic acids are produced by bacterial endophytes (Bloemberg and Lugtenberg 2001) .

On the basis 16S rRNA gene sequencing phylogenic analysis reveled of about 118 isolates comprising of 17 proteobacterial genera in the chromium treated plant sample of Albizia lebbeck. The proteobacterial genera commonly comprised of Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Salinococcus and Marinomonas (Manikandan et al. 2015) . There are certain multi-metal resistance endophytes, one of such endophyte is Achromobacter piechaudii a bacterium isolated from Sedum plumbizincicola and characterized by morphological features, biochemical and 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenic analysis. The bacterial strain portrayed increased level of resistance to cadmium, zinc and lead along with other salutary properties such as solubilization of phosphors and production of IAA and lastly presence of the strain significantly increased the availability of cadmium, zinc and lead in soil (Ma et al. 2016) . Effective bioremediation can be generally achieved by constructed wetland vegetated with Leptochloa fusca. It was found that, when a combination of three endophytic bacteria namely Pantoea stewartii, Microbacterium arborescens and Enterobacter species used for bioaugmentation, the consortium of the bacteria could enhance the growth of L. fusca and simultaneously contributed to the removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants and also ameliorated the toxicity in the constructed wetland (Ashraf et al. 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 244, "end": 260, "text": "(Ma et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 638, "end": 659, "text": "(Compant et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1106, "text": "(Sun et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1355, "text": "(Divya and Kumar 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1692, "text": "(Manikandan et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2259, "text": "(Ma et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2776, "text": "(Ashraf et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phytoimmobilization"}, {"text": "Fungus on the other side also plays an important role in phytoimmobilization, which is a direct representation of the capacity to tolerate and immobilize pollutants by concurrently increasing the amount of biomass (Sudha et al. 2016) . Currently studies are focused on evaluating the capacity of endophytic fungus to induce metal tolerance and partial immobilization in plants. One such example can be cited for the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium that enhanced cadmium tolerance and its partial immobilization in infected plants named Festuca arundinacea and F. pratensis. Additionally it was observed that photochemical efficacy of photosystem II increased, indicating the reduction of cadmium stress (Soleimani et al. 2010a, b) . Species of Exophiala, Metarhizium, Promicromonospora and Pencillium also showed increased tolerance to metal stress of copper and cadmium. But it was Pencillium funiculosum that highly ameliorated biomass yield, chlorophyll and total protein contents in its host plant Glycine max L. under Cu stress (Khan and Lee 2013) . Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus (AMF) is a group of mycorrhizal fungus that could penetrate roots through cortical cells of the vascular plants. In Triticum the grain and shoot yield was increased under different concentration of Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn when inoculated with AMF compared to un-inoculated Triticum (Khan et al. 2014) . Dark Septate Endophytes (DSEs) are asexual chlamydospores ascomycetous fungi that inhabits within the living plant root in a symbiotic relationship. One of such endophyte is Exophiala pisciphila, which regulates physiological response in Z. mays under soil cadmium stress. The mechanism is not clear how such tolerance is achieved by Z. mays by the help DSE (Wang et al. 2016) . The immobilization of soluble arsenic is another interesting feature displayed by these endophytic fungus. Piriformospora indica is one of such fungus the colony of which was isolated from Oryza sativa root and was evaluated for its impact on the plant. Primarily it was found that hyper-colonization of the fungus that ultimately alleviated biomass density, root amelioration, number of chlorophyll and stabilization of oxidoredox status by the modulation of the antioxidative enzyme system which finally protects the plants photo-system under stress induced due to hyperconcentration of arsenic (Mohd et al. 2017) .
