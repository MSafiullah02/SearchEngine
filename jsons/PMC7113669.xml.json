Four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus, have been described (Woo et al., 2010, Woo et al., 2012). In pigs, five CoVs have so far been identified and these include: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in the Alphacoronavirus genus; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in the Betacoronavirus genus; and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in the Deltacoronavirus genus. PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV primarily cause enteric infections in pigs; PRCV has a predilection for the respiratory tract; PHEV infection produces encephalomyelitis rather than enteritis.",

            "text": "PEDV was first identified in England in the 1970s and has since spread to other European and Asian countries (Song and Park, 2012). In October 2010, the PEDV strains circulating in China were reported to have become more virulent than classical PEDV strains, with some causing up to 100% morbidity and high mortality in suckling piglets (Li et al., 2012, Sun et al., 2012). In April 2013, PEDV emerged in United States (U.S.) swine and caused severe illness and high mortality in piglets (Stevenson et al., 2013). Sequence analyses revealed that the U.S. virulent PEDVs (U.S. PEDV prototype strain) are most genetically similar to the Chinese virulent PEDV strain AH2012 (Chen et al., 2014, Huang et al., 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013). In January 2014, a mildly virulent PEDV variant was identified in the U.S. that had insertions and deletions in the spike gene (U.S. S-INDEL-variant strain) compared to the virulent U.S. PEDV prototype strain (Chen et al., 2016a, Vlasova et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014b). Since its emergence in the U.S. in April 2013, PEDV has spread rapidly across the country and resulted in the estimated death of 8 million pigs in the first year, causing economic losses of $900 million to $1.8 billion (Paarlberg, 2014). In addition, PEDV has recently also emerged or re-emerged in China, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Belgium, France and Portugal (Grasland et al., 2015, Mesquita et al., 2015, Pasick et al., 2014, Puranaveja et al., 2009, Song and Park, 2012, Stadler et al., 2015, Theuns et al., 2015, Vlasova et al., 2014, Vui et al., 2015). Currently, PEDV remains a significant threat to the global swine industry.",

            "text": "Infection with PEDV, PDCoV and TGEV can lead to similar clinical symptoms including diarrhea, dehydration, variable vomiting, and high mortality especially in neonatal piglets. These clinical diseases and lesions are indistinguishable and specific laboratory diagnostic testing is imperative to differentiate PEDV, PDCoV and TGEV infection. However, prevalence of TGEV in the swine population has been very low in recent years based on data from various veterinary diagnostic laboratories (unpublished) while detection and differentiation of emerging PEDV and PDCoV have become critical. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid, sensitive and specific tool and is currently most commonly used for detecting PEDV and PDCoV from clinical samples. A number of real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays have been developed for the detection of PEDV (Alonso et al., 2014, Jung et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2007, Lowe et al., 2014, Opriessnig et al., 2014, Thomas et al., 2015) and PDCoV (Chen et al., 2015, Marthaler et al., 2014). A spike gene-based real-time RT-PCR has also been described to differentiate the U.S. prototype and S-INDEL-variant PEDV strains (Wang et al., 2014c). However, implementation of these rRT-PCR assays requires trained technicians and sophisticated and expensive instruments and therefore these rRT-PCR assays are not suitable for on-site applications. In recent years, a point-of-need PCR detection platform integrating the insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology and a field-deployable device (POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyzer) has been developed and is now commercially available for automatic detection and interpretation of PCR results within one hour (Tsai et al., 2014, Tsai et al., 2012b). The iiPCR or RT-iiPCR assays have been demonstrated to have excellent sensitivity and specificity for the detection of various targets, including classical swine fever virus in pigs (Lung et al., 2015) and various pathogens in shrimp, dogs, cats, and horses (Balasuriya et al., 2014, Tsai et al., 2012a, Tsai et al., 2014, Wilkes et al., 2015a, Wilkes et al., 2015b, Wilkes et al., 2014a).",

As shown in Table 1\n, the primers and probe for PEDV were designed to target a highly conserved region in M gene among PEDV strains; the PDCoV RT-iiPCR primers and probe also targeted a highly conserved region in M gene among PDCoV strains. Both PEDV and PDCoV RT-iiPCR probes were labeled with FAM fluorescent reporter dye at the 5\u2032 end. The PEDV probe was labeled with an internal ZEN quencher and Iowa Black FQ (IWBkFQ) quencher at the 3\u2032 end. The PDCoV probe was labeled with a minor groove binder group (MGB) with a non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) at the 3\u2032 end. After adding 5 \u03bcl of the nucleic acid sample, the final Premix/sample mixture was transferred to an R-tube\u2122 (GeneReach USA). The tube was spun briefly in a Cubee\u2122 mini centrifuge (GeneReach USA) and placed into the reaction chamber of POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyzer. The default program of the POCKIT\u2122 device includes an RT step at 50 \u00b0C for 10 min and an iiPCR step at 95 \u00b0C for about 30 min. The reaction completed in less than one hour. POCKIT\u2122 device collects optical signals through an integrated circuits controlled-regulated sensor. Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios were calculated by dividing light signals collected after iiPCR by those from before iiPCR (Tsai et al., 2012b). Based on the default thresholds, S/N ratios of <1.2 and >1.3 were assigned as \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201d, respectively. A \u201c?\u201d result was assigned to those with an S/N ratio between 1.2 and 1.3, indicating that the signals were ambiguous and the sample should be tested again.",

An internal control (IC) containing an artificial nucleotide sequence was also included in this multiplex rRT-PCR. The expected size of the IC amplicon was 100 bp. The PEDV, PDCoV, and IC amplicons were individually detected by a FAM-, NED-, and Cy5-labeled TaqMan probe, respectively. The rRT-PCR amplification was carried out in 25 \u03bcl reaction mixtures containing 20 \u03bcl of master mixture, 2.5 \u03bcl of 200 nM ROX and 2.5 \u03bcl of the extracted nucleic acids. The duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR was performed on an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The conditions were set as follows: 30 min at 42 \u00b0C and 15 min at 93 \u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 93 \u00b0C for 15 s and annealing-elongation at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. Fluorescence signals were captured at the 60 \u00b0C step. The threshold for the Ct analysis was manually adjusted to 0.05, together with an automatic baseline. The Ct of the internal control was designed to be about 30 under these conditions. In addition to clinical samples, the serial dilutions of PEDV IVT RNA, PDCoV IVT RNA, PEDV isolates and PDCoV isolates were also tested by the duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR. The linear correlation coefficient (R2) and slope of the curve were determined automatically with the 7500 Real-Time PCR System software. The slope was used to calculate amplification efficiencies (E = 101/\u2212slope\n \u2212 1) for each primer/pair set. Based on statistical analysis of analytical sensitivity with IVT RNA of known copies, cutoff Ct of the duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR for PEDV (FAM) and PDCoV (NED) detection was both set at 40 to achieve >50% detection at 10 copies per reaction (Caraguel et al., 2011).",

For example, iiPCR methods have been used in small animal clinics and shelters (e.g. canine distemper virus and canine influenza virus), on livestock farms (e.g. porcine circovirus type 2), on shrimp farms (e.g. white spot syndrome virus and Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei), and by government agencies (e.g. classical swine fever virus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus-acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease) for surveillance and diagnostic purposes in various countries (Lung et al., 2015, Tsai et al., 2014, Wilkes et al., 2014b). In the current study, we developed and evaluated PEDV RT-iiPCR and PDCoV RT-iiPCR assays which were highly specific and did not cross react with other enteric pathogens. The PEDV RT-iiPCR and PDCoV RT-iiPCR had high analytical sensitivity with LoD95% of 21 copies of PEDV RNA molecules per reaction and 9 copies of PDCoV RNA molecules per reaction, respectively. Analysis of viral RNA extracted from 10-fold serial dilutions of PEDV cell culture isolates (a U.S. PEDV prototype strain and a U.S. PEDV INDEL-variant strain) showed that the PEDV RT-iiPCR was 10\u2013100 fold less sensitive for endpoint detection compared to the reference PEDV rRT-PCR (Lowe et al., 2014, Madson et al., 2014, Thomas et al., 2015). However, it is noteworthy that the reference PEDV rRT-PCR was run 40 cycles in this study and all Ct values <40 were reported as positive without an established cutoff Ct. The endpoint dilutions negative by the PEDV RT-iiPCR but positive by the reference PEDV rRT-PCR had very high Ct values (35.4\u201337.5). When testing 10-fold serial dilutions of a PDCoV cell culture isolate, the PDCoV RT-iiPCR had equal sensitivity for endpoint detection to the reference PDCoV rRT-PCR (Chen et al., 2015). Overall, the PEDV RT-iiPCR and PDCoV RT-iiPCR had analytical sensitivities comparable to the reference PEDV rRT-PCR and PDCoV rRT-PCR.",
