And the modern social network study has inferred much new quantitative knowledge about human activity patterns, such as influencer\u2019s identification [2]\u2013[5], the network topology measurement [6], [7], trust analysis [8]\u2013[10], social hot spot-tracing [11]\u2013[13], and the dynamics of information spread [14]\u2013[16]. However, many applications, from pandemic prediction to earthquake response, require an understanding of how these patterns change when human encounter unfamiliar conditions [17], [18]. Especially for China, who suffered from frequent natural disasters, the understanding of how the behaviors of hundreds of millions of Web users change is very important. The empirical study of the human flesh search (HFS) [19], [20], for one, provided quantitative insights into these collective responses of Web users in China. Inspired by previous research on Web users collective responses, we choose two empirical cases in China-Yi\u2019liang (2012) and Ya\u2019an earthquakes (2013). What makes it additionally useful is that many densely populated areas in mainland China, such as Sichuan, Fujian, and so on, are frequent earthquake areas and often suffered severe damage from earthquakes.",

However, after further study, a group of researchers represented by Huberman et al.\n[28] found that social interactions within Twitter cannot be inferred directly from a declared relationship set of friends and followers: many users interact with few other people in their declared relationship network [28]\u2013[31]. The key problem is that the structure of the underlying interaction network is not visible and must be inferred from the flow of information between individuals, which poses a serious challenge to our efforts to understand how the structure of the network affects social dynamics and the spread of information [32].",

The goal of our work is to provide a way to extract the underlying hidden social network that more clearly represents the information cascade and actual interactions among users after an earthquake. We will then address the problem in understanding of hidden social networks behind the online information flow.\n1)What about the languages used by participants? How is the demographics of participant users? Are there regional features? What are the differences before and after the earthquake?2)What are the common features of influential users? What are the key factors in user influence?3)When a user reposts, will he/she evenly repost tweets that attract him/her, or just those tweets posted by his/her friends? Also for users whose message are reposted, does the reposting all take place solely among their followers? Are there any differences in information diffusion patterns before and after the earthquake?4)Compared with early Web2.0 online communications, does the Sina-Weibo platform have unique features that include social and information dissemination functions?5)Are there any correlations between the type of interacted user relationships and the topological feature of user networks?",

Section III-A includes the empirical results of eight individual attributes: the configured language of a personal page, gender, location, the number of followers, the number of friends, the number of posted tweets, the number being reposted, and the correlation among three user rankings. Section III-B analyzes the proportion of each type of user relationship between interacted users and discusses the differences in reposting patterns of each interacted user group by the user relationships. Section III-C uses social network analysis to unveil the topological properties of two types of underlying interaction networks, which are extracted by the WIF model, and analyze the correlation between influential user groups of two networks. Section IV closes this paper with remarks for future work.",

During the aftermath in Yi\u2019liang which was hit by a 5.7-magnitude earthquake on September 7, 2012, Fig. 4(b) shows that Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong topped the rank in the number of participant users and the proportion of active users located in these three areas is 27.83%, these three cities are the political center, the financial center, and the largest province in the economy, respectively. Only 3.5% of active users are located in the local province (Yunnan). In cases prior to the earthquake, there is too little data to analyze unfortunately, probably because Yi\u2019liang is a very remote country in Yunnan province. Therefore, we replaced it with Ya\u2019an which is a popular tourist destination (in the same way later). Then, we found in Fig. 4(a) hat local province (Sichuan) ranked first in the number of active users posting Ya\u2019an common topics, with a share of 26.33%, at the same time the sum of shares in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong still reaches 29.25%.\n",

That is, human communities are much larger than those of other primates and hence require more time to be devoted to social maintenance activities. However, there is an upper limit on the amount of time that can be dedicated to social demands, so this sets an upper limit on social group size [41], [42]. It is known that humans have the cognitive capacity to maintain about 150 stable social relationships. With the advent of different types of super social networking services developing one after another, people have once again picked up the topic for discussion [43], [44]. Many researchers have investigated how tools, such as Facebook and Twitter, have changed our capacity to handle social connections using the empirical study [45]\u2013[47]. Here, Fig. 5(a) and (b) also shows the shadow of Dunbar\u2019s number on Sina-Weibo.",

Maybe this is what makes Weibo different from other online social platforms. Third, followers are indeed the major driving force for the Weibo information spread, but at the same time, the reports from strangers are equally crucial. Particularly in some public emergencies, strangers are likely to be in the vanguard of discussing and distributing news in real time. So, from the point of view of information distribution, in addition to the followers\u2019 count of a user, it is also important to examine whether the tweet is selected as a hot message used to push to all other users (see http://hot.weibo.com/).",

For the scale-free property in a social network, the research team of Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1s holds that it is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, there will be heavy tail phenomenon [55]. We do not rule out the possibility, because the number being reposted is indeed an important factor for a tweet in a real-time-based push service shown in Fig. 7(c).

In fact, Fig. 8 has given us some intuition that there is probably a serious structural imbalance between the \u201cdeclared\u201d relationship network and the real interaction network [57]\u2013[59].
