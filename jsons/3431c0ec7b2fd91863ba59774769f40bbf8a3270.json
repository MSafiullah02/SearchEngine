            "text": "M arjorie Reid was a remarkable woman who epitomised the wealth and breadth of veterinary training, by successfully accepting challenges that ranged from practice, laboratory, fieldwork and senior veterinary administration. Marjorie, who was born in 1926, graduated from the Royal Veterinary College in 1950 and was one of a small, but elite group of women in the veterinary profession in England. She had always had a strong sense of adventure and pioneering spirit and, in 1951, she commenced practice in South Africa. Later, she moved to Kenya and joined the well known Veterinary Research Institute at Kabete near Nairobi. Marjorie enjoyed working in Kenya, where there was a constant challenge to use basic veterinary principles to provide a diagnostic service for commercial and wild animals. Her two daughters were born during this period in Kenya. During 1963 she immigrated to Australia and became the first female veterinarian at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide. It was during this period she became interested in bacteriology and began to develop her skills in this subject.",

            "text": "Always seeking adventure, in 1966 she joined the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries in Papua New Guinea and was based at the Kila Kila Veterinary Laboratory in Port Moresby. When she arrived the laboratory was a converted airport control tower from the Second World War. This tested her strengths in more ways than one, not only in bacteriology, but also filling in as Port Moresby's veterinarian on occasions. With her colleagues, Ifor Owen and Noel Talbot, she showed a remarkable ability to use good practical commonsense to simplify what seemed to be highly complex issues. When the new laboratory was built, she was able to demonstrate her considerable laboratory skills to all and was a good but firm teacher to many. This was a happy and productive period of her life. Marjorie was very good with animals of all species ranging from the usual to exotic species such as crocodiles. Because of her combination of ability and character, she was the 'preferred vet' in a strongly male-dominated society, which reflected her high standing in the community. Many at first underestimated her strength of character and discipline; everyone soon learnt not to loaf about when Marjorie was around.",
