            "text": "The cyanines are among the oldest synthetic dyes commonly used today. The name \"cyanine\" comes from the first member of this class, which was reported by Williams in 1856 and was blue in color [1] . In the ensuing 150+ years, thousands more cyanines have been synthesized due to demand based on diverse applications of these versatile dyes [2] . Their ease of synthesis and rich palette of colors initially motivated the use of cyanines in the textile industry. Later, the cyanines became important components of photographic films, making possible the development of vibrant color images. Both of these applications rely on the ability of cyanines to efficiently absorb light at specific wavelengths in the visible region. Most recently, the cyanines have found a third home in the biotechnology sector that relies on their ability to emit light, i.e., fluoresce. In particular, cyanine dyes have become widely used as fluorescent labels and sensors for bioimaging and detection applications. Many of these applications involve the interaction between the dyes and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which is the subject of this chapter. A brief summary of the structural and spectroscopic properties of the cyanines is in order.",

In these dyes, two nitrogen-containing heterocycles are linked by a polymethine bridge containing an odd number of carbons, which allows resonance delocalization of a positive charge between the two nitrogens. Variation of the length of the polymethine bridge and the identity of the heterocycles allows tuning of the absorption and emission spectra throughout the visible and nearinfrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, addition of two extra methine units typically causes a ca. 100 nm spectral shift to a longer wavelength. Meanwhile, dyes based on dimethylindole and benzothiazole heterocycles have comparable absorption and emission wavelengths, whereas benzoxazole-containing dyes absorb at shorter wavelengths. Adding substituents to one or both rings allows further fine-tuning of the spectra.",

This chapter will consider these two structural classes separately, since they often exhibit vastly different spectral and nucleic acid binding behavior, which leads to distinct applications. For example, the fluorescent DNA labels Cy3 and Cy5 are symmetrical cyanines, while the commonly used fluorescent DNA stain thiazole orange (TO) and the dimeric analogue TOTO-1 are unsymmetrical cyanines (the latter with respect to the chromophore, not the overall structure). This introduction concludes with a brief description of nucleic acid binding modes. Cyanine dyes typically associate noncovalently with doublehelical DNA in one of two ways: (1) intercalation, in which the dye inserts between two adjacent base pairs resulting in a \u03c0-stacked sandwich complex, or (2) minor groove binding, in which the dye inserts lengthwise into the narrower of the two grooves present in the DNA structure. Methods for determining DNA binding modes are reviewed elsewhere [3] and so will not be discussed here. For additional information, interested readers are also referred to recent detailed reviews of the interactions between cyanine dyes and DNA [4, 5] . This chapter will focus on how the dye structure relates to nucleic acid binding mode and photophysical behavior, with emphasis on both fundamental properties and applications. ",

The dye, pinacyanol, caused a decrease in the viscosity of a DNA solution, in contrast to acridine dyes, which increased the viscosity of the same solutions. Intercalation necessarily causes the DNA to lengthen, leading to the observed increased viscosity, so Lerman concluded that pinacyanol bound in a nonintercalative manner and this conclusion was supported by later studies. However, simply decreasing the bridge length of the dye by two methines yields pseudoisocyanine, which unequivocally binds to DNA by intercalation at low dye to DNA ratios [7] . Another example is provided by the tricationic dye DiSC 3+ (5) , which binds to various types of DNA by intercalation as well as by minor groove binding as either a monomer or a cofacial dimer [8] .",

            "text": "An interesting class of symmetrical cyanines features substitution of the methine bridge. For example, Yarmoluk and coworkers synthesized Cyan2, an analogue of DiSC 1 (3) bearing a methyl group at the beta (i.e., central) carbon of the trimethine bridge [9] . Under identical conditions, the unsubstituted dye exhibits a <5-fold increase in fluorescence in the presence of DNA while the \u03b2-methyl analogue displays a ca. 100-fold fluorescence enhancement (Table 1) [9, 10] . The difference can be traced to the background fluorescence of the two dyes in the absence of DNA. A similarly large enhancement is observed for the \u03b2-methyl dye in the presence of RNA as well. The origin of this behavior has been attributed to a change in the stereochemistry of the trimethine bridge [11] . In the unsubstituted dye, the strongly fluorescent all-trans isomer should be favored. However, substitution on the bridge is expected to lead to cis isomers, which are nonfluorescent (Fig. 3 ). Whether binding of Cyan2 to DNA or RNA induces isomerization to the all-trans form or promotes fluorescence by another mechanism is unclear. Regardless of the mechanism, the fact that the \u03b2-methyl dye has a low fluorescence quantum yield in solution allows it to exhibit a large enhancement upon nucleic acid binding. The idea of using fluorogenic dyes as indicators for the presence of nucleic acids will also be an important theme for the unsymmetrical cyanines described later in this chapter. The same group studied the impact of substituents at carbon 6 of the benzothiazole ring system for trimethine dyes bearing unsubstituted or \u03b2-substituted bridges [10] . Bulky benzoylamino groups at these positions (e.g., dyes 1 and 2) led to improved fluorescence enhancements in the presence of DNA, relative to DiSC 1 (3) and Cyan2 (Table 1 ). In both cases, the larger fluorescence enhancement is due to lower fluorescence in buffer rather than higher fluorescence in DNA. The likely explanation for these results is enhanced formation of nonfluorescent aggregates by the 6,6 -substituted dyes in the absence of DNA rather than to a change in the inherent photophysical properties of the dye. The peripheral amide substituents also increase the selectivity for DNA over RNA and bovine serum albumin, a protein that is known to bind organic dyes via hydrophobic interactions.",

One exception is the monocationic dye DiSC 2 (5) , which was found to assemble into helical aggregates in the presence of a hybrid duplex composed of complementary DNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) strands [12] . (Like many symmetrical cyanines [13, 14] , DiSC 2 (5) also aggregates in water, but only at higher concentrations than were used in the assay.) Aggregation of DiSC 2 (5) in the presence of PNA-DNA duplexes leads to a 120-nm shift to shorter wavelength of the absorption spectrum, resulting in a visible blue-to-purple color change. Thus, the PNA oligomer and cyanine dye constitute a simple qualitative sensor for the presence of specific DNA sequences. Several subsequent reports described improvements on the original assay [15] [16] [17] .",

These dyes exhibit very low fluorescence quantum yields in aqueous solution but 10 2 -10 3 -fold enhancements upon binding to nucleic acids [19] . The fluorescence response has long been attributed to restricted torsional motion of the dye excited state when intercalated into DNA [20] . Recent ultrafast time-resolved experiments by Ernsting and colleagues were consistent with a twisting motion leading to nonradiative relaxation of TO in fluid solution [21] . In addition, calculations by Yaron and coworkers indicate that twisting beyond an interplanar angle of 60 \u2022 is required before nonradiative relaxation becomes efficient [22] . Thus, TO and presumably other unsymmetrical cyanines need not be planar in order to exhibit a large fluorescence enhancement: rigidification with an interplanar angle less than 60 \u2022 should also lead to strong fluorescence from the dye.

This means that nucleic acids present at nanomolar or lower concentrations will not be detected by the fluorogenic dye. In order to improve the affinity and, therefore, sensitivity of DNA/RNA detection, a series of bis-cyanine dyes such as TOTO-1 (Fig. 2) have been synthesized [26] . The presence of two intercalating groups as well as four positive charges leads to binding at nanomolar concentrations. Vauthey and coworkers showed that the maximum fluorescence enhancements observed for bis-intercalating cyanines are lower than those for the corresponding monointercalating analogues [27] . This is not due to differences in the quantum yields of the bound dyes, which are very similar. Rather, in the absence of DNA, the two chromophores of a bis-intercalating cyanine dye can \u03c0-stack, yielding an intramolecular dimer. The authors propose that stacking of the two chromophores actually suppresses the twisting motion that leads to deactivation of the dye excited state. Thus, where fluorophore dimerization is often associated with reduced fluorescence, in the case of the bis-cyanines dimerization enhances fluorescence, albeit only slightly. Since the quantum yield in the absence of DNA is higher for the bis dyes, they exhibit smaller enhancements upon intercalating into DNA. In practice, the significantly higher affinity of the bis-intercalators usually outweighs the lower fluorescence enhancement, so dyes such as TOTO-1 are more widely used than monointercalating analogues.",

Whereas most applications of these dyes involve detection of the DNA or RNA into which they intercalate, these investigators used a DNA-dye assembly to fluorescently label other things, such as mammalian cells and polystyrene beads. The concept is shown in Fig. 5 : intercalating dyes bind to the DNA template at high densities, creating very bright fluorescent objects (where \"brightness\" is defined as the product of the molar extinction coefficient and the fluorescence quantum yield). By virtue of having so many dyes bound to the same DNA template, the overall assembly has a very large extinction coefficient. (A similar concept was proposed by Glazer in a patent [36] ; the main innovation in the pub- Fig. 5 Illustration of the DNA nanotag concept. Intercalating dye is an unsymmetrical cyanine such as a high-affinity thiazole orange or oxazole yellow analogue. Branched DNA substrates allow assembly of high-density fluorophore arrays lished work is the use of a branched DNA template to increase the density of fluorophores.) This supramolecular fluorophore, referred to as a \"DNA nanotag\", can be functionalized with various groups that allow its attachment to a wide variety of substrates, imparting an intensely fluorescent label. Furthermore, additional attachment of longer-wavelength energy acceptor dyes leads to efficient FRET. This allows large separation between the excitation and emission wavelengths, which should improve image quality due to reduced background fluorescence from the sample. The main drawback to the system is that the dyes are noncovalently bound to the DNA template, meaning they are free to dissociate and bind to other molecules in the sample. Nevertheless, straightforward chemistry is available that allows dyes to be covalently attached to DNA, so this problem should be readily addressed.",

Genomic DNA generally exists in highly compacted states when packaged into cellular nuclei, and an important question concerns how this affects DNA binding of dyes that are used for microscope imaging.\u00c5kerman and coworkers approached this question by studying the association of four different unsymmetrical cyanines with genomic DNA packaged into protein capsids of bacteriophage T5 [37] . The dyes varied with respect to overall charge (+1 to +4) and DNA binding mode (intercalation vs minor groove binding). Binding of the dyes to the packaged capsid DNA was compared to the same DNA extracted from the capsid. The binding kinetics were considerably slower, particularly for the tetracationic bisintercalator, YOYO-1. In addition, the affinities of the dyes were ca. fivefold lower for the capsid DNA. Possible explanations for these results include conformational constraints imposed by packaging of the DNA into the capsid, which is expected to im-pact intercalation because of the structural distortion imposed on the DNA by the dye, and competition with multivalent cations that are present inside the capsid to help balance the high negative charge density compared with extended DNA in solution. Another intriguing result from this study was the tendency of the dication intercalator (YO-PRO-1) and groove binder (BOXTO-PRO [38] ) to induce aggregation of the bacteriophage. The authors suggest that this is due to association of the dyes with the phage tails by electrostatic attraction, resulting in cross-linking of the phage and assembly into clusters.",

In an attempt to address this, Seitz and coworkers synthesized a series of PNA oligomers in which the central base was replaced by TO and was flanked by various combinations of bases [40] . The PNA-TO conjugates were then hybridized with their corresponding perfectly matched and mismatched single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. (A thymine was always placed directly across from the TO.) In contrast to the earlier report by Netzel et al., the highest quantum yields (\u03c6 f = 0.20-0.27) were observed when at least one of the flanking base pairs was A-T/T-A. When both flanking base pairs were G-C or C-G, \u03c6 f = 0.13-0.16. Whether the lower quantum yields in G-C/C-G intercalation sites reflect a less restrictive environment or partial quenching by a competitive mechanism such as electron transfer is unknown. Similar experiments in which TO is forced to intercalate at a specific site within DNA-DNA duplexes would also be interesting because the different helical parameters for DNA-DNA and PNA-DNA could lead to different fluorogenic responses by the dye in homologous sequence contexts.",

If the dye conjugate binds to another molecule and the local environment of the dye is substantially changed in the resulting complex, a change in fluorescence might be observed allowing sensing of the binding event. The first example of this concept was reported by Ishiguro and coworkers, who attached oxazole yellow to a DNA oligonucleotide at an internal position [41] . (The dye was linked to the phosphorus in the internucleotide linker, so no base was replaced.) Hybridization of the YO-DNA conjugate to a complementary DNA resulted in a ca. 20-fold fluorescence enhancement. This effect was attributed to intercalation of the dye into the DNA double helix.",

A slightly different application involves using the fluorescence enhancement of the conjugated TO to report on successful hybridization of a PNA to a desired nucleic acid. For example, Peteanu and coworkers developed a FRET assay for RNA splicing, a posttranscriptional process that deletes internal regions of RNA (introns) and connects the flanking regions (exons) [48] . PNA probes labeled with fluorescent donor and acceptor dyes were designed to hybridize to the exons on either side of an intron. Splicing deletes the intron and links the exons, bringing the donor-and acceptor-labeled PNAs into close proximity and leading to a large increase in FRET efficiency (Fig. 6) . TO-labeled probes were used initially to demonstrate that both PNAs bound to the large, folded RNA target. In the FRET experiments, TO was retained as the donor fluorophore while an Alexa dye was conjugated to the acceptor PNA. Splicing resulted in >75% FRET efficiency and was detected both in bulk solution and by using single molecule microscopy. The fluorogenic dye used in hybridization probes need not be attached to a terminal position. As described earlier, Seitz and coworkers have synthesized PNA probes in which TO was attached directly to the backbone at an internal site [40] . The resulting PNA-TO conjugates are called \"forced intercalation\" (FIT) probes due to the fact that TO, like other intercalators such as ethidium bromide [49] , binds only weakly to PNA-DNA hybrids. These probes can be hybridized to complementary DNA targets having any base opposite the TO [50] . Good mismatch discrimination was observed when the dye was attached to the PNA via a short linker extending from the quinoline ring. Fluorescence enhancements of 10-20-fold were observed upon hybridization to perfectly matched targets, whereas lower enhancements result from targets having single mismatches directly adjacent to the TO site. Comparison of a series of linker lengths and conjugation site revealed that an acetyl linker to the quinoline ring gave the best results, with tenfold greater fluorescence than the same linker to the benzothiazole ring.",

Conjugation of TO to three different polyamides did not alter their specific recognition sequences [54] . Fluorescence enhancement values of >1000 were observed for specific targets and these were at least tenfold greater than for mismatched sequences. The affinities were in the expected range for the polyamides (K d = ca. 10 nM). In addition, DNA footprinting experiments verified that the polyamide domain bound in the minor groove while plasmid relaxation assay demonstrated unwinding of the DNA, indicating that the TO chromophore intercalates into the DNA.
