It is used as a tool to assist mechanical engineers in specifying the correct plant sizes to meet the anticipated space cooling requirements. It is common that the engineering tools and rules of thumbs already have a safety margin, in addition to which engineers typically load another margin (Houghton 1998). Assumed in this approach is that there will not be any energy constraints placed in the life of the building and its equipment. It assumes that it is acceptable to over-engineer the mechanical ventilation system for that worst case scenario with the consolation that it can always be operated at partial load, even if that requires far more power than running a correctly sized plant at full load.",

Electricity is so scarce it only exists to run government-owned computers, and personal computers are pedal operated like an old-fashioned sewing machine. Energy is produced by the muscles of people or beasts of burden, then stored kinetically in either flywheels or springs to power factories, transport and weapons. What is realistic and sobering about Bacigalupi\u2019s future is the challenge he makes to many assumptions we take for granted: unlimited resource, continued global collaboration, genetic diversity. What if the only energy available was what we could muster from our muscles in a world with limited food?Overhead, the towers of Bangkok\u2019s old Expansion loom, robed in vines and mold, windows long ago blown out, great bones picked clean. Without air conditioning or elevators to make them habitable, they stand and blister in the sun. (Bacigalupi 2009, p. 10).\n",

Based on the psychrometric analysis of a PMV response, reducing air temperature will drive a response far more significant than the reduction in humidity. So in terms of comfort energetics we can say that reducing temperature (15 W/vote) is 17 times more effective than reducing relative humidity (262 W/vote), and that an evaporative cooler is 100 times more effective in achieving comfort than an air-conditioner, even if the air-conditioner does not perform any dehumidifying function.",

These are used in outdoor and semi-outdoor settings with the common notion that they are unsuitable for indoor use because they increase the moisture ratio of indoor air. From the human thermal comfort point of view, this logic is flawed. If the indoors and outdoors were at the same temperature and the misting fans were merely saturating the air surrounding an occupant, then there is no psychrometric difference. If all environmental (T\u00b0C, RH%, MRT\u00b0C and v m/s) and personal variables (clo and met) were made equal to both indoor and outdoor conditions, the PMV will be identical. Likewise, the adaptive model will show that if the daily, or mean monthly T, were the same in both the in and outdoor, the ideal T will be the same. So strictly speaking, from the thermal comfort perspective, there should be no objection that would prejudice against the indoor operation of misting fans, an example being provided by gadget blogger Christen Costa (2012).",

At high altitudes and in the absence of condensing nuclei, air can be supersaturated to \u2018several hundred per cent\u2019 (Battan 2003, p. 8). Where condensing nuclei are present it will be correct to say that air cannot contain more moisture in the vapour state, yet still more moisture can still be accommodated as suspended droplets. For instance if one were to breathe outdoors on a cold morning when the air is saturated, one can observe a breath mist. In a similar condition if one were to go for a run, the profuse perspiration will evaporate, condense into suspended droplets, and appear as steam emerging from the hot skin. It is thus incorrect to think of saturated air being incapable of accommodating more moisture. The determining function is that as long as the saturated vapour pressure of skin was higher than the vapour pressure of air, perspiration can still evaporate.",

Graphically, the acceptable range is bound by two (horizontal) limits in terms of humidity ratio lines of 4.25 and 12 g/kg, and so it is erroneous to interpret the standard as thinking the acceptable range is bound by (the curved) relative humidity lines of 20 and 90 %.

            "text": "On closer inspection of Sterling\u2019s et al. (1985) graphical presentation, a number of concerns can be raised:The term \u201chumidity\u201d is used very loosely. Of interest to the issue of RH should be that of gaseous atmospheric humidity. However references are made to \u201chumidifying equipment\u201d where it is water in liquid state that becomes a breeding site for bacteria. Control of RH is immaterial to the subsequent delivery of these contaminants in the misting aerosol.The literature review is based on work done with airborne pathogens but the selection does not necessarily reflect a representative sample of the most common variants in the indoor environment. Salmonella and rhinovirus are, respectively, the most striking bacterium and virus missing. Uncommon viruses like polio and cowpox are included in the mix and their relevance is somewhat stretched.It is unclear what is meant by \u201ceffect\u201d which for microbes could possibly refer to the increase in colony forming units per cubic metre of air (i.e. cfu/m3). Alternatively, it could even refer to absenteeism, occupants who complain of at least two SBS symptoms, perceived air quality, and an unending list of criteria. Without understanding the actual mechanics of each parameter it is impossible to plot wedges to indicate linear relationships between effect and RH%.In many instances the relationships are non-linear to RH%. Different species of viruses also behave differently: influenza and vaccinia decrease in viability at increasing RH whereas results for poliomyelitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis showed the opposite tendency (Harper, 1961 in Kowalski 2005). One can as easily argue that 50 %RH is the ideal condition for limiting, as it is for promoting, respective strains of virus.The graphical presentation gives the impression that at certain point in the RH scale, there are no deleterious effects. A casual observer will not realise that the author of the paper admits, \u2018\u2026there is probably no level of humidity at which some biological or chemical factor that affects health negatively does not flourish\u2019 (p. 615).Many other parameters come into play to influence the \u2018effect\u2019. For example the termination of microbes from desiccation is affected by \u201cthe initial moisture content, growth phase, rate of drying, relative humidity or composition of the surrounding medium, temperature, the coincident presence of sunlight, and other factors\u201d (Kowalski 2005 p. 113). No mention has been made if these conditions have been kept constant to isolate RH % as the determining factor in the review of literature.An impression is given that all the listed contaminants should be controlled for good IAQ. However, whilst \u2018viruses are almost exclusively communicable\u2019, fungal spores, on the other hand, \u2018are almost exclusively noncommunicable\u2019 and come \u2018mainly from the outdoor environment\u2019 (Kowalski 2005 p. 4).\n",

It is typically 5 \u03bcm or smaller in size\u2019 (Rural Infection Control Practice Group, 2008, Sect. 2.1). At 50 %RH, a droplet of distilled water of 3 \u03bcm can be reduced to a tenth of its original size in a fraction of a second (Dunklin and Puck 1948). Figure 5.7 shows that RH has an impact on the initial evaporation rates, with droplets evaporating about four times faster at 0 %RH than at 70 %RH. However, droplets which contain bacteria do not evaporate completely, and despite similar initial evaporation rates, droplets with bacteria retain the nuclei for much longer that those without. The authors of this graph observed:\nthe graph shows how droplet-contained bacteria might not appreciably affect droplet evaporation until almost all of the droplet water had evaporated and the agglomerated bacteria or droplet nuclei were left. At this point the survival of the agglomerated bacteria might depend on such unknowns as the water evaporation rate, the position in the agglomerate, and the life-sustaining water content of the bacteria.

Carrying the argument further, it is hypothesized that as the cells agglomerate or form a protective shell configuration during evaporation, the outermost cells would dry to a critical (life-sustaining) water content before those cells deeper in the agglomerate do. From this, it might be expected that those relatively large droplets that originate with the most microbes would contain at least one deeply embedded viable microorganism for the longest period of transport time downwind.

In this scenario it is assumed that the occupants will sit in the region where the fan speed is about 1 m/s (Rohles 1983, figure). The moving air across a lightly clothed occupant will cause a difference in temperature (dT) from the forced convection. Various models exist (Emmanuel 2005, p. 69) to determine the magnitude of the dT. At 1 m/s the average of these eight models is dT = \u22123.89 \u00b0C (s.d. = 1.69 m/s) in agreement with the difference in equivalent temperature of 3.3 \u00b0C when ceiling fans are compared to still air (Rohles 1983).
