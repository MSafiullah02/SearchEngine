Analysis of available epidemiological data suggest that physiological adaptations that counterbalance the hypoxic environment altitude may protect from severe impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Potential underlying mechanisms such as: (i) a compromised half-live of the virus caused by the high-altitude environment, and (ii) a hypoxia mediated down regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main binding target of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the pulmonary epithelia are discussed.",

ACE2 is a trans-membrane protein located in the cells of the respiratory tract, lung, heart, arteries, veins, kidney and intestines (Hamming et al. 2004 ). In the pulmonary epithelium ACE2 acts as a vasodepressor, balancing the action of its counterpart the homologous enzyme ACE1 which acts as vasoconstrictor, and both enzymes form the oxygen-sensitive renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) (Hampl et al. 2015) . In normoxia, the RAS system is regulated by the dynamic equilibrium between the expression of ACE1 and ACE2.",

Similar results were obtained in rats (males, SD) exposed to conditions equivalent to 4,500 meters of altitude, which after 28 days showed increased levels of ACE1 and decreased expression of ACE2 in heart cells (Dang et al. 2020) . These observations are highly relevant for the pathogenesis of COVID-19, since the level of expression of ACE2 in pulmonary epithelial cells has been demonstrated to be positively correlated with the rate of infection of the first SARS-CoV (Jia et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2020; Ren et al. 2020; Rothan and Byrareddy 2020) . These studies clearly may suggest that high-altitude inhabitants (i.e., chronically exposed to hypoxic conditions) express reduced levels of ACE2 in their lungs (and other tissues). Thus, adaptation to high-altitude environment could render local inhabitants less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virus penetration and consequently are protected from the development of the disease defining acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, is located at an elevation of 3,500 masl. The road distance between Lhasa and Wuhan (the center of the COVID-19 epidemic) is 3,503 km. However, Lhasa and Wuhan are also connected by train, bus, and by air, which indicates that tourist and commercial exchange between these cities may be considerable (Tseten 2020). The impact of COVID-19 on the plateau region (of 9,000,000 inhabitants) has been drastically low compared to the rest of China (Lei et al. 2020) . Indeed, only 134 confirmed cases were reported for the plateau region (Tibet, Qinghai and part of Sichuan) (Gelek 2020; World-Health-Organization 2020) ( Figure 1A) . A representative cohort of 67 patients (only two imported cases) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Sichuan reveals that 54% were completely asymptomatic (no cough, fever, or headache), and less than 10% of the patients presented fever. Nevertheless, 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort developed severe medical condition, however, all of these patients fully recovered after treatment, resulting in no mortality. Moreover, 29% of all the patients were potential high-risk due to predisposition with chronic respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (Gelek 2020; World-Health-Organization 2020). Thus, it appears that both the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the general prevalence of infection in Tibet does not correspond to global trends.",

La Paz, the administrative capital of Bolivia (2,706, 000 inhabitants) and the capital of the province of La Paz, is situated in a range of 2,400 to 4,000 masl, with a greater part of its metropolitan population located in the region of El Alto (at 4,150 masl, 922598 inhabitants) These data become more striking when compared to the rate of infection in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, as the second largest and the most important province of Bolivia which is located at the Bolivian lowlands (400 masl; 1,686,375 inhabitants) (Instituto-Nacional-de-Estad\u00edstica. 2018; Ministerio-de-Comunicaci\u00f3n. 2017 ). Santa Cruz, which since the first registered case (March 10 th ) amassed a total of 100 positive Covid-19 cases until April 7 th (Prensa-Latina 2020). Furthermore, analyzing the Covid-19 pandemic in all Bolivian regions below 2,500m until April 7 th (40 cases distributed between Pando (110,436 inhabitants -6 cases), Cochabamba (1,916,000 inhabitants -33 cases), and Tarija (482,196 inhabitants -1 case), there are a total of 140 infected patients (Ministerio-de-Comunicaci\u00f3n 2020). In conclusion it appears that Covid-19 infection rates at high-altitude regions in Bolivia are approximately three-fold lower than lowlands ( Figure 1B) .",

Indeed, a high-altitude environment is characterized by drastic changes in temperature between night and day, air dryness, and high levels of ultraviolet (UV) light radiation (United-States-Environmental-Protection-Agency 2017). In particular UV light radiation A (UVA) and B (UVB) is well known to be capable of producing alterations in the molecular bonds of the DNA and RNA, and thus UV radiation at high-altitude may act as a natural sanitizer (Andrade 2020; Zubieta-Calleja 2020a; Zubieta-Calleja and Zubieta-DeUrioste 2017). In relation to SARS-CoV-2, while complete disinfection cannot be achieved by UVA and UVB, these radiations should shorten the half-life of any given virus (Andrade 2020; Zubieta-Calleja 2020b) . It is clear that, all together, these factors may dramatically reduce the \"survival\" capacity of the virus at high-altitude, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and therefore its virulence. Finally, due to the lower density of air and greater distance between molecules at high-altitude, the size of the airborne virus inoculum must be smaller than at sea level.",

Apart from the province of La Paz, the provinces of Oruro(at 3,735 masl; 538,200 inhabitants), Potosi (at 4,090 masl; 141,251 inhabitants), and Sucre (2810 masl, 300,000 inhabitants) are also part of the Bolivian high-altitude Andes (Instituto-Nacional-de-Estad\u00edstica. 2018; Ministerio-de-Comunicaci\u00f3n. 2017).The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Bolivia were reported on March 10 th , one in Oruro (a person returning from Italy), and a second in Santa Cruz (a person arriving from the United States). Four days later, on March 14 th , seven new cases were confirmed in Oruro, and from that date until April 7 th (26 days later), no new positive cases were confirmed. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in La Paz was reported on March 19 th , and to April 7 th ; (17 days later), there are a total of 36 confirmed new cases (8 imported, 28 local infections).Finally, only 8 positive cases of COVID-19 were detected in Potos\u00ed, and 1 in Sucre, making a total of 54 cases in Bolivian provinces located at high-altitudes (Ministerio-de-Comunicaci\u00f3n 2020). Despite the fact that strict political measures were enacted across the country to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f restrict the movement of its population since the start of the pandemic (March 15 th , restriction of access to Bolivia for travelers from the Schengen area, United Kingdom, Ireland and Iran; March 16 th and 17 th , restriction measures moderate circulation; March 21 th , total quarantine; March 26 th , state of sanitary emergency), the low rate of infections in Bolivia's high-altitude population is remarkable, and clearly does not follow the often exponential infection rates reported in many countries after an initial COVID-19 outbreak (World-Health-Organization 2020) for this disease.",
