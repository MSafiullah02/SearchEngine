Its value to the biodiversity of the world is not only warranted by its unique physical characteristics, such as being the fastest land mammal (Chapter 7), but also its unique evolutionary lineage as the only extant representative of its genus, Acinonyx. Concerns over levels of genetic variation among cheetahs were first raised as captive programs grappled with difficulties in breeding cheetahs (Chapter 27). These observations led to research investigating the biological basis of the low rates of captive breeding success (10%\u201315%) and the concurrent high rate of infant mortality (29%) (O\u2019Brien et al., 1985). This research led to the discovery of low levels of genetic diversity in the cheetah, which were attributed to one or several severe population bottlenecks. As a consequence, debates arose regarding the impact of low genetic diversity on the survival of the species, and the cheetah has been featured in genetic textbooks since the 1980s. Early research on cheetah represented one of the first studies in the new field of conservation genetics.",

While publications on cheetah genetics may appear contradictory at times, the fundamental conclusions have been consistent for over 30 years, with various measures confirming low genetic diversity (section \u201cGenetic Diversity\u201d), which was shown to have originated thousands of years ago (section \u201cHistoric Demography\u201d), and with a relatively recent divergence of extant published subspecies (section \u201cSubspecies Definition and Divergence\u201d). The differences debated among geneticists only affect the interpretation of genetic results regarding precise timing of events and extent of reduced genetic diversity. This chapter also covers the cheetah\u2019s phylogenetic (evolutionary relation based on genetic data) position among other felids (section \u201cSpecies-Level Taxonomy\u201d), the genetic structure of the subspecies and within geographical regions (section \u201cPhylogeography\u201d), an overview of additional genetic studies including kinship (section \u201cAdditional Insights Into Cheetah Genetics\u201d), and implications of genetic findings for cheetah conservation (section \u201cDiscussion\u201d).",

One of the most striking aspects of molecular genetic studies in the Felidae was how rapidly felids evolved into eight different lineages (over a 6-million-year period), each with unique biogeographical histories. Earlier groupings of felid lineages were largely based on morphological features and life-history patterns. The cheetah was generally considered to be an early divergence from the felid radiation due to some of its unique adaptations, including its incompletely retractile claws (Chapter 7). However, the advent of genetic approaches has provided clarity to more confidently reconstruct felid evolutionary history, and today the cheetah is included in the Puma lineage, which was the sixth of eight lineages to branch off during felid evolution [7 million years ago (MYA); Johnson et al., 2006, Li et al., 2016, Werdelin et al., 2010; Fig. 6.1]. The cheetah\u2019s closest living relatives are known to be the puma (Puma concolor) and the jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) (Johnson et al., 2006, Li et al., 2016, Werdelin et al., 2010; Fig. 6.1), with whom the cheetah likely shared a common ancestor and evolutionary history prior to their divergence. Today the cheetah is found in the Old World, and the puma and jaguarundi in the New World (Chapter 3). The cheetah has 19 chromosomal pairs (i.e., 38 chromosomes) like most felid species (O\u2019Brien et al., 2006). The cheetah is the only extant representative of its genus.",

Allozymes are\nvariant forms of enzymes and can be detected with electrophoretic analyses. The observed differences of protein migration reflect differences at the amino acid level, which correspond to alleles (alternative genetic variants) of the corresponding gene(s) (locus/loci) at the DNA level. The percentage of polymorphic allozyme loci within several mammal species was estimated to range from 15% to 60% (O\u2019Brien et al., 1987). Thus, it was surprising that analyses of 55 southern African cheetahs failed to identify genetic polymorphisms across a total of 52 allozyme loci (O\u2019Brien et al., 1983, O\u2019Brien et al., 1985; Table 6.1), and that additional analyses only identified 3 polymorphic loci in 73 eastern and southern African cheetahs [observed heterozygosity (differing alleles at a given locus/set of loci; measure of diversity) = 0.014 and 0.0004, respectively; O\u2019Brien et al., 1987; Table 6.1]. Presence of multiple protein forms at 155 abundant soluble protein loci within individual cheetahs was also low (observed heterozygosity = 0.013) compared to 7 other felid species (O\u2019Brien et al., 1983; Table 6.1).",

In addition, protein-based markers are more likely to be linked to functional differences and as such allele frequency differences may be susceptible to selective pressure (environmental conditions affecting survival of organisms with a particular characteristic).

Only 2 MHC I alleles were identified in 2 individual cheetahs through sequencing (Yuhki and O\u2019Brien, 1994; Table 6.1) and 5 MHC II-DRB alleles were identified in 25 individuals through Reference Strand-Mediated Conformational Analysis (Drake et al., 2004; Table 6.1).

While a 5-fold increase in the number of MHC I alleles identified in 2011 may appear like an increase in genetic diversity, the identification of only 8 additional alleles despite a 54-fold increase in the number of study animals is in fact further confirmation of low levels of allelic diversity in the cheetah. The low level of allelic diversity was further confirmed by comparison to other species, which harbor more alleles in fewer individuals (Table 6.1). More recently, a 95%\u201398% reduction in single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was observed when the complete MHC sequence of 7 cheetahs (4 Namibian, 3 Tanzanian) was compared to that of human (Homo sapiens), dog (Canis familiaris), and an outbred domestic cat; only 11 variants affecting the amino acid sequence were detected in the MHC I coding region of cheetahs (Dobrynin et al., 2015; Table 6.1).",

Menotti-Raymond and O\u2019Brien (1993) proposed a scenario of distant past, rather than recent, reduction in the global population size. The demographic event causing this drastic loss of diversity was estimated to have occurred during the end of the Pleistocene (10,000\u201312,000 years ago; Table 6.2\n). This proposal was based on the time estimated for the near-reconstitution of genetic variation at rapidly evolving minisatellite (nuclear DNA marker consisting of variable numbers of tandem repetitions of 5\u201350 nucleotides) loci. The authors obtained similar estimates with mtDNA RFLP data calibrated on estimates of divergence of the species from the Panthera genus. This estimated timeframe was later corroborated with 82 microsatellite markers (Driscoll et al., 2002), with the time needed for nuclear alleles to reach fixation in the MHC (Castro-Prieto et al., 2011), and with whole genome data (Dobrynin et al., 2015) (Table 6.2). In the Asiatic cheetah population a more recent, independent, bottleneck was inferred based on a significant heterozygosity excess observed in the 18 microsatellite loci tested (Charruau et al., 2011).",

The separation of the two sub-Saharan populations was further supported with mtDNA-CR (Freeman et al., 2001), microsatellites (Driscoll et al., 2002), and whole genome variation (Dobrynin et al., 2015; Table 6.3). The time of divergence was estimated to be a minimum of 4500 years ago by both Driscoll et al. (2002) (Table 6.3) and O\u2019Brien et al. (2017). In 2017, based on their interpretation of the published evidence, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Cat Specialist Group\u2019s Cat Classification Task Force has suggested that A. j. raineyi and A. j. jubatus be synonymized into a single subspecies (Kitchener et al., 2017). Additionally, Kitchener et al.

This finding refuted the possibility that the current Asiatic cheetah population may have originated from individuals imported from eastern Africa for hunting purposes in the past century. The time of divergence between A. j. venaticus and A. j. jubatus was estimated at 4,700\u201367,400 years ago. The extent of the separation of A. j. venaticus from the African subspecies was not clear-cut. mtDNA data placed the split between A. j. jubatus and A. j. venaticus slightly more recently than that of A. j. jubatus with A. j. soemmeringii, while microsatellite data suggested that the divergence with A. j. soemmeringii was the more recent event (Charruau et al. 2011; Table 6.3). The pairwise genetic distance (F\nST: measure of difference between populations) of A. j. venaticus to the African subspecies appeared to be possibly slightly larger than distances within African populations (mtDNA F\nST values: 0.818\u20130.958 compared to 0.724\u20130.930; Charruau et al., 2011). However, it is important to keep in mind that divergence values between A. j. venaticus and the other subspecies could have been stochastically increased due to a postulated recent bottleneck in A. j. venaticus (section \u201cHistoric Demography\u201d).

Multiple component analysis distributed the regions somewhat according to their geographical location, with the most northern region (Outjo) appearing to be most distinct, but F\nST values for Okahanja and Outjo (F\nST = 0.086) were below the recommended threshold for separate population assignment (0.15\u20130.20; Manel et al., 2002).

This was significantly higher compared to the 5%\u201310% mortality in domestic cat or the corresponding coronavirus (SARS) outbreak in humans in 2002, making this the deadliest documented death toll of a coronavirus.

While no molecular work has been performed on the morphological traits to date, insight was gained on several coat related phenotypes. Genes from the keratin-associated protein family were found to be expressed at higher levels in the yellow background of the cheetah fur (Kaelin et al., 2012), which is consistent with observations that fur of the black spots is softer relative to the coarser textured yellow background. Conversely, genes responsible for pigmentation were expressed at higher levels in the black spots relative to the less pigmented yellow background of cheetah fur (Hong et al., 2011). Another gene whose expression was increased in the black spots was a paracrine hormone, which was hypothesized to be involved in coordination of the spot pattern (Kaelin et al., 2012). The genetic basis for the king cheetah coat variant was determined to be a mutation in the transmembrane aminopeptidase Q gene (Kaelin et al., 2012). Rare cases of gross morphological deformities have occurred in the past, but no literature is available to substantiate whether they were based on low genetic diversity, inbreeding in a captive setting, or teratogenic influences.",

In the same study over 10 million nucleotides of segmental duplications were identified, and affect genes that are believed to be involved in energy balance, nutrition, and sensory adaptation. In addition, gene expansion was observed in the MHC extended class I region, which includes vomeronasal receptors, as well as olfactory and G-coupled receptor genes; these gene expansions were tentatively linked to behavior (pheromones) and physiology (e.g., LDH-A and LDH-B are linked to a carnivorous diet).

Therefore, the initial discovery of genetic uniformity of the cheetah was quickly followed by concerns about the species\u2019 chances of long-term survival. However, the discovery that the event or events leading to the loss of diversity could be placed over 10,000 years ago and that cheetah numbers had recovered by the 19th century, indicate the cheetah\u2019s ability to survive and thrive, despite reduced levels of genetic diversity, over extended periods of time.

Wild cheetah populations of the same subspecies and geographical region were generally panmictic; minor population structure was only observed in allele frequencies of the rapidly evolving immune response genes. As such, translocations of wild caught individuals performed as part of conservation actions within these populations, only mimic natural connectivity (which may be restricted by anthropogenic barriers to gene flow).",

While in principle exchange between populations of different subspecies should be avoided as they may be considered evolutionary significant units (Moritz, 1994), a compromise between preserving the existing structure and the urgency to rescue a small population at risk of disappearing, may have to be reached. Relatively recent times of subspecies divergence and the merging of two subspecies in 2017, are additional considerations during such decision making processes (section \u201cSubspecies Definition and Divergence\u201d). This dilemma may have to be addressed for the Iranian population at some point if the numbers remain below 100 individuals (Chapter 5). Additional information on the genetic health of the existing population is critically and urgently needed to determine if this population is likely to survive without management actions.\n",

Breeding decisions are guided by the genealogical data managed through the regional and international cheetah studbooks (Chapter 23). Reputable captive programs (Chapter 22) aim to retain 90% of genetic diversity over 100 years (Lacy, 2012). However, this may not be sufficient in the long term as the small number of founders only represents a subset of the genetic diversity found in the wild (founder effect) and the 10% genetic diversity lost is irreversible. This loss of diversity can only be compensated for by the recovery of lost breeding lines through \u201creinjection\u201d of viably preserved reproductive material (e.g., gametes) of founders into the captive population, addition of new founder individuals (or gametes) obtained from the wild, or inclusion of unrelated captive individuals to the breeding pool. As with wild populations, interconnectivity of captive populations should be maintained as much as possible, through regional and interregional exchange of animals or reproductive material. As the cost of genetic research continues to decrease, it will provide the possibility to assess the genetic makeup of all captive cheetahs, and thus the integration of animals of unknown origin into the cheetah breeding pool, if genetic evaluation determines that they represent a new breeding lineage. Of note, inbred individuals (high homozygosity levels) can also be used for further breeding if they represent a unique breeding lineage, as homozygosity is not heritable.",

Non invasive samples are increasingly employed to provide answers regarding populations that have not yet been intensely studied (Chapter 31). Additional research involving contemporary and museum samples is currently under way to fill existing knowledge gaps regarding the published subspecies (L\u00e9na Godsall Bottriell, personal communication). However, it is crucial to remember that data obtained from genetic studies published to date agree sufficiently in confirming the low genetic diversity of the species at nonrepetitive loci (section \u201cGenetic Diversity\u201d), dating the origin of the low diversity to more than 10,000 years ago (section \u201cHistoric Demography\u201d), providing support for genetic differences, although short divergence times, between the populations corresponding to most published subspecies (section \u201cSubspecies Definition and Divergence\u201d), and showing only minimal population structure within geographical regions (section \u201cPhylogeography\u201d). This in turn enables a joint message in terms of recommendations for cheetah conservation, as well as in situ and ex situ management (sections \u201cGenetic Diversity and In Situ Cheetah Conservation\u201d and \u201cGenetic Diversity and Ex Situ Cheetah Conservation\u201d).
