PED is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration followed by high mortality in suckling piglets (50\u2013100%). Animals of all ages are susceptible to PEDV; however, older pigs usually present a milder form of the disease with lower mortality rates (Alvarez et al., 2015, Annamalai et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The PEDV genome consists of a large (\u223c28 kb) single-stranded, positive sense RNA molecule that contains seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2-6). ORFs 1a and 1b encode large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b), which are cleaved by viral encoded proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) involved in basic mechanisms of viral RNA transcription and replication (Lee, 2015, Song and Park, 2012). ORFs2-6 encode four structural proteins, including the Spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and one accessory protein ORF3 (Huang et al., 2013, Lee, 2015, Song and Park, 2012). Among the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein plays an important role in receptor binding, cell membrane fusion and entry, and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV (Cruz et al., 2008, Sun et al., 2008, Wicht et al., 2014). Notably, the S gene has been frequently targeted in epidemiological studies involving phylogenetic analysis and in a number of molecular and serologic diagnostic assays for PEDV (Gerber et al., 2014a, Huang et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2015, Li et al., 2015, Park et al., 2007, Paudel et al., 2014b). Additionally, the M and N proteins have been targeted for the development of molecular and serological diagnostic assays for PEDV (Ishikawa et al., 1997, Okda et al., 2015, Wicht et al., 2014)",

However, given the similarities of these clinical manifestations with other enteric pathogens of swine, including the closely related coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Chen et al., 2015, Kim et al., 2000a, Kim et al., 2000b, Song et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2014a), a diagnosis of PEDV cannot be made based on the clinical signs and histological changes observed in the gastrointestinal tract. A positive PEDV diagnosis involves the detection and identification of PEDV-specific proteins or its RNA genome in clinical samples from affected animals. Conventional PEDV diagnostic methods are based on the detection of the virus, its nucleic acid, viral proteins or antibodies induced in response to infection. While the diagnosis of a PEDV outbreak is usually best obtained by virological detection methods, serological assays provide important information regarding previous exposure to the virus and the immune status of a given animal and/or herd. Here we present a brief overview of virological and serological diagnostic methods that allow rapid and accurate detection of PEDV and assessment of the host responses to infection.",

Following an incubation period that varies from one day in 1-day-old nursing piglets to 3\u20136 days in 3-week-old weaned piglets, characteristic clinical signs of PED, including diarrhea and vomiting, are observed and usually persist for approximately 5\u201310 days (Jung et al., 2015, Madson et al., 2016, Madson et al., 2014, Stevenson et al., 2013). Fecal shedding of PEDV occurs shortly after infection (1\u20133 days), and the virus RNA has been detected in feces for up to 24\u201330 days post-infection (pi) (Thomas et al., 2015). A short viremic phase has been described between one and five days pi in suckling piglets (Jung et al., 2015, Madson et al., 2016). Viral antigens have been detected in enterocytes in the duodenum and ileum as early as 12 h pi in 1-day old piglets (Madson et al., 2016), and through day 14 pi in 3-week-old weaned pigs (Madson et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The dependence on exogenous trypsin and the lack of a better cell culture system, make the isolation of PEDV in cell culture difficult. Two recent studies undertook a comprehensive approach to optimize the isolation of PEDV in cell culture (Chen et al., 2014, Oka et al., 2014). However, from a total of 138 clinical samples that were positive for PEDV by RT-PCR, only 13 PEDV isolates were recovered in Vero cells (Chen et al., 2014, Oka et al., 2014). All these isolates were obtained from intestinal contents (Oka et al., 2014) or intestinal homogenates (Chen et al., 2014), and no virus was recovered from rRT-PCR positive fecal samples (Chen et al., 2014). Recently, however, Chen and collaborators (Chen et al., 2016a) reported the isolation of three PEDV strains from rRT-PCR fecal samples. These observations indicate a low diagnostic sensitivity of PEDV isolation methods, and highlight the need for improved cell culture systems for the isolation PEDV in vitro. Primary intestinal epithelial cell cultures or cell lines expressing the PEDV receptor, porcine aminopepidase N (APN) (Li et al., 2007, Nam and Lee, 2010, Shan et al., 2015), could be valuable alternatives and potentially increase the success rate of PEDV isolation in cell culture (Liu et al., 2015).",

The principle of the assay consists of the immune-detection of viral antigens (antibody-antigen reaction) in cell culture or ultrathin cryosections of tissues from pigs suspected of being infected with PEDV. Intracellular viral antigens are detected using fluorophore-conjugated PEDV-specific antibodies. Fluorescent viral antigens are visualized in the cytoplasm of infected cells under a fluorescent microscope. PEDV antigens have been detected by IF in villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine during various stages of infection, including at early stages involving the incubation period of the disease (first 12\u201324 h pi). Viral antigens have been detected in intestinal samples for up to 72 h after the onset of clinical signs by the IF assay (Debouck et al., 1981, Guscetti et al., 1998, Jung et al., 2014).",

IHC is based on the detection of PEDV antigens in tissue sections by means of immunological (antibody-antigen) and chemical (enzyme-substrate) reactions (Ramos-Vara, 2011). Viral antigens are detected using PEDV-specific antibodies that are subsequently detected using an enzyme-linked secondary antibody followed by chemical substrate development (Guscetti et al., 1998, Ramos-Vara, 2011). Similar to the results obtained via IF, PEDV antigens have been detected by IHC prior to the development of clinical signs (1 day pi) and up to day 14 pi (Guscetti et al., 1998, Madson et al., 2016). The major advantage of using in situ detection methods such as IF and IHC for the diagnosis of PEDV is that they allow the visualization of target cells and the tissue distribution of viral antigens during the course of infection (Duraiyan et al., 2012). Additionally, IHC is performed in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, which allows long-term storage and retrospective testing of archived tissue samples.",

PEDV antigen capture or sandwich ELISAs are based on the use of a pair of PEDV-specific antibodies to capture and detect virus antigens onto a solid phase (Aydin, 2015, Callebaut et al., 1982, Carvajal et al., 1995, Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005). The solid phase (polystyrene, polyvinyl or polypropylene microplate well) is coated with the PEDV-specific capture antibody and incubated with the sample, when the PEDV antigens present in the sample bind the capture antibody. The detecting antibody will bind to the virus antigen, and the reaction is developed by adding an enzyme-linked secondary antibody, followed by a chemical substrate (Aydin, 2015). PEDV capture ELISAs have been developed for detection of PEDV in fecal samples (Callebaut et al., 1982, Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005, Sozzi et al., 2010); however, detection of the virus in clinical samples may be affected by several factors (Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005), including the timing of sample collection and the conditions of sample storage and shipping to the laboratory (i.e. temperature) (Jung and Chae, 2004, Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005). Fecal shedding of PEDV, for example, was consistently detected by antigen capture ELISA during the acute phase of the disease, but much less frequently during the incubation period or the recovery phase (Callebaut et al., 1982, Sozzi et al., 2010). It is advisable, therefore, that samples are collected during the acute phase of infection, shortly after the onset of the clinical signs (Sozzi et al., 2010), and shipped on ice to the laboratory (Jung and Chae, 2004).",

Given the higher diagnostic specificity of probe-based assays, they are usually the best choice for molecular diagnostics.

Another advantage of the rRT-PCR is its multiplexing capability, which allows simultaneous testing and discrimination of different strains of PEDV (Zhao et al., 2014) or of other enteric viral pathogens of swine, including the closely related coronaviruses TGEV and PDCoV (Kim et al., 2007, Song et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2014). Recently, a multiplex rRT-PCR assay developed for simultaneous detection of PEDV, TGEV, group A rotaviruses, and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) revealed that PEDV is the most common viral cause of enteric infections in China (42.1%), whereas the most common co-infection found in the study involved PEDV and PCV2 (9%) (Zhao et al., 2014).

Initially, gel-based PCR assays were used; however, these were quickly replaced by more sensitive and high throughput rRT-PCR assays (Wang et al., 2014b). With the introduction of PDCoV in the US swine population in 2014 (Wang et al., 2014a), multiplex rRT-PCR assays were developed to allow simultaneous testing and discrimination between the two swine enteric coronaviruses. At the SDSU Animal Disease and Research Diagnostic Laboratory (ADRDL), for example, a multiplex rRT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of PEDV, PDCoV and TGEV has been used routinely since July 2014. Since then, approximately 22,000 samples from about 25 US states have been tested using this multiplex assay. Of these 12% were positive for PEDV, 2.2% were positive for PDCoV and 1.8% were positive for both PEDV and PDCoV. No TGEV positive samples were detected from July 2014 to March 2016. A summary of the multiplex rRT-PCR results for individual years (2014, 2015 and 2016) is presented in Fig. 4\n. Notably, similar cumulative detection rates are observed at national level, with 12.3% of accessions tested since 2014 being positive for PEDV and 2.2% testing positive for PDCoV (www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/secd).",

Recently, Miller and collaborators evaluated two rRT-PCR assays targeting the N and the S gene of PEDV (Miller et al., 2016). The detection limit of these rRT-PCRs were 10\u22126 and 10\u22125 for the N and S assays, which corresponds to a virus suspension containing \u223c10\u22122.2 and \u223c10\u22120.2\n TCID50/mL of PEDV, respectively (Miller et al., 2016). Additionally, from a total of 1064 fecal swabs that were subjected to these rRT-PCR assays, 354 samples tested positive by the N assay, while 349 were positive by the S assay, indicating a slightly better performance of the N-based assay. Interestingly, by inoculating 3-day-old piglets with a serial dilution of PEDV with known Cq values, the authors were able to determine the infectious dose of the virus (101.3 and 102.3 TCID50/mL) and correlate it to the Cq values obtained by the N rRT-PCR assay (24.14 [\u00b10.02] and 27.28 [\u00b10.07], respectively) (Miller et al., 2016).",

The assay uses four to six primers that recognize six to eight regions of target DNA in association with the Bst DNA polymerase, which presents strand-displacement activity (Notomi et al., 2015, Ren and Li, 2011). The synchronized binding of the primers to the target sequences maintains the specificity of the assay (Notomi et al., 2015, Ren and Li, 2011). Notably, the amplification step can be performed under a single temperature (isothermal conditions), resulting in the synthesis of large amounts of nucleic acid (Notomi et al., 2015, Ren and Li, 2011). The amplification reactions can be performed using inexpensive equipment (i.e. water bath), without the need for thermocyclers (Notomi et al., 2015, Oura et al., 2013). Furthermore, the addition of a fluorescent dye in the reaction mix allows the assessment of the results by simple visual inspection (Tomita et al., 2008). To date, two isothermal amplification assays have been designed and evaluated for the diagnosis of PEDV (Ren and Li, 2011, Yu et al., 2015).",

The analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined and compared to a conventional and a real-time RT-PCR by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of a viral stock containing a known amount of PEDV. The detection limits of the rRT-LAMP and the rRT-PCR were identical with both assays detecting 10\u22121\n TCID50/mL, whereas the detection limit of the conventional RT-PCR was 100-fold higher (101\n TCID50/mL) than the other two assays.

The IFA assay is based on an antibody-antigen reaction. Usually, PEDV infected Vero cell cultures are used as antigen substrates to detect antibodies present in serum samples from suspect animals. If the sample is positive, the PEDV specific antibodies bind to the antigens immobilized in the solid phase. In a second step, these antibodies are detected with fluorophore-labeled anti-porcine secondary antibodies and visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Thomas et al., 2015, Clement et al., 2016). The IFA assay presents specificity comparable to ELISA and FFN assays and has the advantage of being less time consuming and easier to perform (Lee, 2015). IFA can also be used for qualitative (positive or negative) or quantitative (antibody titer) evaluation of PEDV-specific antibodies in serum. To determine the titers of antibodies, serial two-fold dilutions of serum are incubated with PEDV infected cells, and the antibody titers are determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum in which specific fluorescent signal is observed. PEDV-specific antibodies are first detected by IFA by 7\u201314 days post-exposure, and titers seem to be maintained for at least 43 days pi when a decline in the detectable levels of antibodies is observed. Despite being a useful assay for detection of antibodies during the acute stage of infection, the IFA is not the test of preference to determine prior exposure to PEDV due to the lower analytical sensitivity of the assay. Additionally, interpretation of endpoint IFA antibody titers is more subjective than other PEDV antibody detection assays.",

Virus neutralization is defined as the reduction in viral infectivity mediated by antibodies (neutralizing antibodies [NAbs]) (Klasse, 2014). By binding to the virions, NAbs block one or more steps of the viral replication cycle (i.e. entry, binding to cellular receptors, uncoating), and/or cause aggregation or lysis of virus particles, thus neutralizing or reducing virus infectivity (Klasse, 2014). Historically, CPE-based VNs have been used to detect NAbs against PEDV (Paudel et al., 2014a, Paudel et al., 2014b). However, interpretation of endpoint neutralization titers based on CPE is complicated by the fact that the trypsin added in the culture media leads to cell rounding and detachment, thus impairing precise differentiation between virus- and trypsin-induced changes in cellular morphology (Okda et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Recently, neutralization assays using a fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) format have been developed for PEDV (Okda et al., 2015, Thomas et al., 2015). The FFN allows for rapid assessment of NAbs titers (\u223c30 h) against PEDV, because viral antigens can be detected earlier than virus induced CPE in infected cells. To detect the presence of PEDV neutralizing antibodies using the FFN assay, serial dilutions of serum samples are incubated with a constant amount of PEDV, thus allowing the antibodies to bind to the virus. The antibody-virus mixture is transferred to susceptible Vero cell cultures and PEDV infectivity is assessed by using an anti-PEDV fluorophore-conjugated antibody (Okda et al., 2015, Thomas et al., 2015). NAb titers are determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in 90% or greater reduction in fluorescent foci relative to negative control samples (Okda et al., 2015). Neutralizing antibodies against PEDV have been detected by day 7\u201314 pi (Okda et al., 2015, Thomas et al., 2015) in experimentally infected animals, with high titers of NAbs being detected for at least six months post-natural infection (Clement et al., 2016, Ouyang et al., 2015).",

This is important to monitor the transfer of maternal immunity to suckling piglets. The levels of NAbs detected in colostrum are higher (four-fold) than those detected in serum. Whereas, levels of NAbs detected in milk are similar to those detected in serum (Clement et al., 2016, Okda et al., 2015). Given that VN or FFN assays detect functional antibodies capable of neutralizing PEDV infectivity, these assays have been frequently used in studies evaluating novel vaccine candidates for PEDV (Collin et al., 2015, Goede et al., 2015, Liu et al., 2012, Paudel et al., 2014a). Additionally, NAbs are very specific, and VN assays are capable of discriminating between serologic responses induced against PEDV and the closely related TGEV (Chen et al., 2016b, Lin et al., 2015).",

The reaction is developed as described above for the indirect ELISA, with the addition of an enzyme-linked secondary antibody followed by an enzyme-substrate colorimetric reaction. The main advantage of the blocking ELISA is its increased specificity when compared to the indirect ELISA (Aydin, 2015); however, the assay specificity seems to be dependent on the isotype of the blocking antibody and its specificity for the target antigen (Carvajal et al., 1995).",

Thus, reliable virological and serological diagnostic assays are extremely important. While virological tests allow the rapid identification of PEDV and its differentiation from other enteric pathogens of swine, serological assays provide valuable information regarding prior exposure to PEDV and the prevalence of infection. Additionally, serological screenings allow the evaluation of novel vaccines and vaccination strategies in the field. Immunoassays such as ELISAs and FMIAs also allow the evaluation of isotype-specific immune responses against PEDV. The introduction of PEDV in the US in 2013 and its re-emergence in Asia have resulted in the development of a broad array of improved diagnostic assays to detect the virus or to evaluate the host responses to infection. As more reagents become available (i.e. monoclonal antibodies against S, N and M), we are likely to see the development of additional diagnostic approaches that may allow rapid on-site diagnosis of PEDV.",
