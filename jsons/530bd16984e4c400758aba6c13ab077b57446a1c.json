This powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media, scientists, and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning and uncertainty quantification. During the early outbreak, the reproduction number was 4.5\u00b121.4, with maximum values of 6.5 and 5.9 in Spain and France. As of today, it has dropped to 0.7\u00b120.2, with minimum values of 0.4 and 0.3 in Austria and France. We found a strong correlation between passenger air travel and the reproduction number with a time delay of 12.6\u00b122.7 days. Our new dynamic SEIR model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe solutions in the benefit of global health.",

Epidemiologists use the basic reproduction number R 0 to quantify how many new infectious a single infectious individual creates in an otherwise completely susceptible population [10] . The public media, scientists, and political decision makers across the globe have started to adopted the basic reproduction number as an illustrative metric to explain and justify the need for community mitigation strategies and political intervention [16] : An outbreak will continue for R 0 > 1 and come to an end for R 0 < 1 [19] . While the concept of R 0 seems fairly simple, the reported basic reproduction number for COVID-19 varies hugely depending on country, culture, calculation, stage of the outbreak [29] . Knowing the precise number of R 0 is important, but challenging, because of limited data and incomplete reporting [9] . It is difficult-if not impossible-to measure R 0 directly [41] . The earliest COVID-19 study that followed the first 425 cases of the Wuhan outbreak via direct contact tracing reported a basic reproduction number of 2.2 [27] . However, especially during the early stages of the outbreak, information was limited because of insufficient testing, changes in case definitions, and overwhelmed healthcare systems [39] . Most basic reproduction numbers of COVID-19 we see in the public media today are estimates of mathematical models that depend critically on the choice of the model, the initial conditions, and numerous other modeling assumptions [9] . To no surprise, the basic reproduction number predicted by mathematical models covers a wide range, from 2.2-3.6 for exponential growth models to 4.1-6.5 for more sophisticated compartment models [29] .",

            "text": "Compartment models are a popular approach to simulate the epidemiology of an infectious disease [23] . A prominent compartment model is the SEIR model that represents the timeline of a disease through the interplay of four compartments that contain the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations [4] . The SEIR model has three characteristic parameters, the transition rates \u03b2 from the suscep-tible to the exposed state, \u03b1 from the exposed to the infectious state, and \u03b3 from the infectious to the recovered state [19] . The latter two are disease specific parameters associated with the inverses of the latent period A = 1/\u03b1 during which an individual is exposed but not yet infectious, and the infectious period C = 1/\u03b3 during which an individual can infect others [26] . For COVID-19, depending on the way of reporting, these two times can vary anywhere between A = 2 to 6 days and C = 3 to 18 days [33, 35, 36] . The most critical feature of any epidemiology model is the transition from the susceptible to the exposed state. This transition typically scales with the size of the susceptible and infectious populations S and I, and with the contact rate \u03b2 , the inverse of the contact period B = 1/\u03b2 between two individuals of these populations [19] . The product of the infectious period and the contact rate defines the reproduction number R = C \u03b2 [9] . Community mitigation strategies and political interventions seek to reduce the contact rate \u03b2 -and with it the reproduction number R-to control the outbreak of a pandemic [36] .",

We express the time-varying contact rate \u03b2 (t) = R(t)/C as a function of the effective reproduction number R(t) and use machine learning [1] to learn the evolution of the reproduction number for each country of the European Union from its individual outbreak history [12] . Our model allows us to precisely quantify the initial basic reproduction number, the reduced current effective reproduction number, and the time to achieve this reduction, which are important quantitative metrics of the effectiveness of national public health intervention. Our model also specifies the exact time delay between the implementation of political actions and their effects on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. This time delay is particularly important to plan exit strategies and estimate risks associated with gradually or radically relaxing current local lockdowns and global travel restrictions.",

For each country, our simulation window begins on the day at which the number of reported cases surpasses 100 individuals and ends on April 25, 2020. For all simulations, we select fixed latency and infectious periods of A = 2.5 days and C = 6.5 days [25, 27, 39] . To account for uncertainties in the initial exposed and infectious populations E 0 and I 0 and in the effective reproduction number R(t), we use Bayesian inference with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo to estimate the following set of model parameters",

A powerful quantitative concept to characterize the contagiousness and transmissibility of the new coronavirus is the basic reproduction number R 0 [41] . This number explains-in simple terms-how many new infections are caused by a single one infectious individual in an otherwise completely susceptible population [10] . However, against many false claims, the basic reproduction number does not measure the effects of public health interventions [9] . Here, we quantify these effects, for every point in time, for every country, using the effective reproduction number R(t), a time-dependent metric that changes dynamically in response to community mitigation strategies and political actions.

It belongs to a class of infectious disease models that epidemiologists characterize as compartment models [11] . Compartment models represent the population via a sequence of compartments through which the population passes as the disease progresses [46] . Out of the many different compartment models, the SEIR model seems best suited to mimic the epidemiology of COVID-19 via four compartments: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations. For more than three decades [4] , epidemiologists have successfully applied the SEIR model to understand the outbreak dynamics of the measles, chickenpox, mumps, polio, rubella, pertussis, and smallpox [19] . For this class of diseases, the outbreak ends as the number of daily new cases, \u03b2 S I, decreases. As such, the classical SEIR model is self-regulating: It naturally converges to an endemic equilibrium, at which either the susceptible group S, or the infectious group I, or both have become small enough to prevent new infections [26] . In epidemiology, this equilibrium is known as herd immunity [17] . In a homogeneous, well-mixed population, herd immunity occurs once a fraction of (1 \u2212 1/R 0 ) of the population has become immune, either through the disease itself or through vaccination. For the basic reproduction number of R 0 = 4.50 \u00b1 1.44 we found in this study, the herd immunity level would be 78%. This value is lower than 94% for the measles, 89% for chickenpox with, 86% for mumps and rubella, and 80% for polio [2] , but significantly higher than the values of 16% to 27% for the seasonal flu [5] . Knowing the precise basic reproduction number of COVID-19 is therefore critical to estimate the conditions for herd immunity and predict the success of vaccination strategies.",

The classical SEIR model is a valuable tool to understand the interplay of the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations under unconstrained conditions. However, for the current COVID-19 pandemic, similar to SARS, MERS, or Ebola, the dynamics of these four populations are tightly regulated by public health interventions [7] . This implies that model parameters like the contact rate \u03b2 , the time it takes for an infectious individual to come into contact and infect others, are not constant, but modulated by social behavior and political action [3] . Here we explicitly account for a dynamic contact rate \u03b2 (t) and express it as a function of the time-varying effective reproduction number R(t) [44] . This allows us to \"bend the curve\" and predict temporary equilibrium states, far away from the equilibrium state of herd immunity, but stable under current conditions [26] . Yet, these states can quickly become unstable again once the current regulations change. Our dynamic SEIR model allows us to study precisely these scenarios.",

The constant reproduction number in Figure  1 , left, nicely captures the exponential increase at the early stages of the outbreak, but fails to \"bend the curve\" before herd immunity occurs. Nonetheless, several recent studies have successfully used an SEIR model with a constant reproduction number to model the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China [35] and in Europe [28] by explicitly reducing the total population N to an affected population N * = \u03b7 N. The scaling coefficient \u03b7 = N * /N is essentially a fitting parameter that indirectly quantifies the level of confinement [3] . For example, when averaged over 30 Chinese provinces, the mean affected population was \u03b7 = 5.19 \u00b7 10 \u22125 \u00b1 2.23 \u00b1 10 \u22124 , suggesting that the effect of COVID-19 was confined to only a very small fraction of the total population [35] . The Gaussian random walk in in Figure 1 , left, naturally captures the effects of public health interventions, however, in a daily varying, rather unpredictable way. It is a valuable method to analyze case data retrospectively, but since it does not allow for a closed functional form, it is not very useful to make informed predictions. From Figure 1 , we conclude that the hyperbolic tangent based ansatz with four physically meaningful parameters is the most useful approach to represent the time-varying effective reproduction number R(t) for our current purposes.",

Unfortunately, we can neither measure the basic nor the effective reproduction number directly. However, throughout the past four months, the COVID-19 pandemic has probably generated more quantitative data than any infectious disease in history. Machine learning offers incredible opportunities to evaluate these data and learn correlations and trends [32, 47] . Here we learn the effective reproduction number R(t) directly from the reported COVID-19 cases in all 27 countries of the European Union, starting from the day of the first reported case on January 24, until today, April 25, 2020. This not only allows us to identify the model parameters and confidence intervals, but also to quantify correlations between travel restrictions and reduced effective reproduction numbers. Table 3 and Figures 2 to 4 summarize our basic reproduction numbers R 0 and the reduced effective reproduction numbers R t for all 27 countries. Our mean basic reproduction number of R 0 = 4.50 \u00b1 1.44 exceeds the first estimates of 1.4 to 2.5 from the World Health Organization based on a tracing study that reported a value of 2.2 during the early outbreak in Wuhan [27] . However, our results agree well with the more recent values of 5.7 for the Wuhan outbreak [39] and with a recent review that suggested values from 4.1 to 6.5 calculated with SEIR models [29] . Our basic reproduction number of 4.5 is lower than the numbers of 18 for measles, 9 for chickenpox, 7 for mumps, 7 for rubella, and 5 for poliomyelitis [2] . Compared to the SARS coronavirus with a range from 2 to 5 [29] , our values of SARS-CoV-2 in Table 3 are rather on the high end, suggesting that the new coronavirus would spread more rapidly than SARS. Knowing the precise basic reproduction number will be critical to estimate the number of contacts to trace, if we want to successfully control the dynamics of COVID-19 through contact trancing [18] .",

On March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Europe the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined [42] . To prevent a further spreading of the pandemic, four days later, for the first time in history, the European Union closed all its external borders [13] . In the following two weeks, the local governments augmented the European regulations with local lockdowns and national travel restrictions. Figure 5 shows that these measures had an enormous effect on the mobility within the European Union: By March 22, 2020, the average passenger air travel in Europe was cut in half, and as of today, April 25, it is reduced by 86% in Germany, 92% in France, 93% in Italy, and 95% in Spain [14] . These drastic actions have triggered an ongoing debate about the effectiveness of different outbreak strategies and the appropriate level of constraints [31] . Table 3 and Figures 5 to 7 summarize our time-varying effective reproduction number R(t) and highlight the time delay of its reduction with respect to the European travel restrictions. An important socio-economical metric is mean time delay of \u2206t = 12.6 \u00b1 22.7 days between the effect of the current travel restrictions and the inflection point of the reproduction number curve. Figures 6 and 7 show that this time delay varies hugely across Europe with the fastest response of 1 day in France and Luxembourg, followed by Spain with 4 days, Germany, Ireland, and Italy with 5 days, and Austria with 6 days. These fast response times naturally also reflect decisions on the national level. France had the first reported COVID-19 case in Europe on January 24, 2020 and acted rigorously and promptly by introducing the first national measures on March 16. Similarly, Italy, Germany, and Spain had introduced their national measures on March 9, March 13, and March 9 [43] . Figures 6 and 7 clearly highlight the special role of Sweden, where the government focusses efforts on encouraging the right behavior and creating social norms rather than mandatory restrictions: The time delay of 21 days is one of the longest in the European Union, and Sweden is one of the few countries where the effective reproduction number .

Political decision makers around the globe are currently trying to identify safe exit strategies from global travel restrictions and local lockdown. Mathematical models can provide guidelines and answer what-if scenarios. Our predictions in Figure 2 show projections of the number of total cases, for three different scenarios: a rapid release of all measures over a period of one month, a gradual release over a period of three months, or a maintenance of the current status quo. Naturally, the case numbers increase in all three cases, with the steepest increase for the most rapid return. Interestingly, our method provides significantly different confidence intervals for different countries suggesting that a controlled return will be more predictable in some countries like Austria and less in others. Our projections suggest that in Sweden, were policy makers had encouraged each individual to take responsibility for their own health rather than enforcing political constraints, the projected case numbers will follow the current curve, without major deviations.",

Just like any infectious disease model, our model inherently faces limitations associated with data uncertainties from differences in testing, inconsistent diagnostics, incomplete counting, and delayed reporting. For our specific study of COVID-19, we encounter a few additional limitations: First, although a massive amount of data are freely available through numerous well-documented public databases, the selection of the model naturally limits what we can predict and it remains challenging to map the available information into the format of the SEIR model. Second, the initial conditions for our exposed and infectious populations will always remain unknown and many new first cases have been reported throughout the past couple of weeks. To reduce the influence of unknown initial conditions, our machine learning algorithm learns these populations alongside the effective reproduction number. Third, in its current state, our model does not distinguish between community mitigation strategies, local public health recommendations, and global political actions. We are currently integrating the current approach into a global network model that will provide more granularity of individual mitigation strategies. Fourth, and probably most importantly, our current knowledge limits our ability to make firm predictions about the recovered group, which will be critical to estimate the return to normal. Recent studies have shown that there is a huge unreported asymptomatic population, up to an order of magnitude larger than the reported symptomatic population traced in our study. More targeted tests will be needed to identify the size of this population and explore whether it behaves differently in terms of contact rate and infectious period, which would both radically change the overall reproduction number. As more data become available, we are confident that we will learn from uncertainty quantification, become more confident in our model predictions, and learn how to quickly extract important trends.",

We adopted an SEIR epidemiology model with a dynamic effective reproduction number, which we learned for each country from its individual reported cases using machine learning and uncertainty quantification. We found that, during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the effective reproduction number across Europe was 4.5\u00b11.4. Today, on April 25, 2020, massive public health interventions have successfully reduced the effective reproduction number to 0.7\u00b10.2. Strikingly, this reduction displays a strong correlation with mobility in the form of air travel, with a time delay of 12.6\u00b122.7 days. This time delay is an important metric as we seek to identify safe exit strategies from the current lockdown and travel restrictions. To highlight the potential of our model, we predicted of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 for different exit strategies that either maintain the current status quo, gradually return to normal, or rapidly return to the early outbreak exponential growth. We showed that our dynamic epidemiology model provides the flexibility to simulate the effects and timelines of various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify solutions that minimize the impact of COVID-19 on global health.",
