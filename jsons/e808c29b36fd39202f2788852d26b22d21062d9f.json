Only the sub-terminal cell which appears to divide immediately before the onset of development becomes an akinete. There is first an elongation and then a rounding out of the sub-terminal cell. The akinete that develops is larger than a vegetative cell, but it has the same cell-wall components and the same kinds of inclusions. An unusually large number of structured granules and ribosomes is present. Unlike the vegetative cell a heavy fibrous coat is laid down outside the inner investment and an electron-dense material, possibly pigment-containing, accumulates within the fibrous coat. The fibrous coat is of medium electron density and the pigment-containing material is drawn outward into rays as the akinete matures. The fibrous coat and the inner investment are separated bv a lucent space in the mature akinete. cells. This is demonstrated by phase-contrast and interference-contrast microscopy of living hyphae and by electron microscopy of preserved hyphae. The young hypha is divided into three protoplasmically differentiated zones: an apical zone, a subapical zone, and a zone of vacuolation. The apical zone extends from the tip basipetally 3-{j,.. and is characterized by an accumulation of cytoplasmic vesicles, often to the exclusion of other organelles. Vesicle membranes are occasionally continuous with plasma membrane. Ribosomes are notably infrequent in the apex, and endoplasmic reticulum is found only in the basal portion of this zone. The transition between the apical and subapical zones is gradual over a distance of several microns. Mitochondria are typically clustered in this transitional region. The subapical zone is largely non-vacuolate and contains representatives of all protoplasmic components including nuclei, dictyosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, abundant ribosomes, miorotubules, secretory__ vesicles, microbodies, and even a few lipid bodies. With increasing distance from the apex the subapical zone merges into the zone of vacuolation. The size and number of vacuoles increases progressively until the bulk of the protoplast is comprised of vacuoles. The demonstration illustrates hyphae of P. ultimum and compares the protoplasmic organization of this fungus with other fungal genera. These findings, along with observations on membrane differentiation and cytochemical reactions, support an hypothesis to explain the origin, transformation, transport and destiny of organelles involved in the expansion of cell surface at the hyphal apex. This demonstration presents models and drawings of the form of the fretwork among adjacent grana. The codirectionality of the helices leads to an integrated, interlocked fretwork. It is suggested that this complex system of intergranallamellae is derived, to a large degree, by fusions of membranes rather than by continuous growth of a once simpler system. DRYAND-The flower of Hibbertia scandens consists of five sepals, five petals many stamens (more than 100), and usually five carpeis. The sepal and petal primordia are initiated in acropetal (centripetal) succession. Mter the inception of the fifth petal, the flat floral apex increases considerably in Width. During this growth of the apex, the stamen primordia are formed in centrifugal sequence. The first stamen primordia arise in groups, usually alternately with the petal primordia. These groups of stamen primordia are formed almost simultaneously, either in continuity with the spiral phyllotaxis of the perianth, or proceeding from one side of the floral apex to the other. Then the inception of more stamen primordia lateral to and outside of the first ones closes the gaps between the initial staminal groups. This process, which occurs rapidly, makes it rather difficult to determine the number of the initial groups of stamens. It seems that in some buds five staminal groups are discernible, whereas in other buds more than five such groups have been distinguished. A special technique was used to obtain a three-dimensional picture of the developing floral apices and buds. The material was stained in alcoholic acid fuchsin and photographed completely immersed in 100% ethyl alcohol, using a microscope with an incident light condensor and objectives with dipping cones. As a result of this technique, the protoderm cells of the floral apex and the primordia of the appendages become visible. to be described had two objectives: (a) to determine if meristematic cells could be induced to enter a particular interphase period and caused to remain in this period for several hours, and (b) to determine if the level of metabolism was phasic in nature as a cell progressed through the mitotic cycle. A stationary phase in the root meristem of excised pea roots was established by prolonged carbohydrate deprivation in sterile culture medium. When established, cells that had collected in the G, period of the mitotic cycle were induced to enter S by pulses or spurts of sucrose provision. Progression and cycle location of the G, cells induced to enter S were measured with tritiated thymidine and radioautography. The results indicated that the number of G, cells induced to enter S increases directly with the spurt duration and that cells could be positioned and retained in the Sand/or G2 periods by varying the duration of the spurt. The data support the hypothesis that S and maybe M have a relatively larger dependence on carbohydrate availability and presumably a greater energy requirement than G, or G2\u2022 1:45",

Van Roots of Pisum sativum have been cultured under nitrogen for different lengths of time to investigate the effects of anaerobic conditions on the mitotic cycle and to compare these effects with those of sucrose starvation. Stationary phase pea roots with meristem cells in either G, or G 2 have been exposed to H3-TdR in the presence and absence of both sucrose and nitrogen for periods of up to 12 hr. Liquid scintillation counting has shown that the onset of DNA synthesis requires both oxygen and a carbohydrate source. Radioautography further demonstrated that the entry of Gi cells into Sand G2 cells into mitosis is prevented under anaerobic conditions. This inhibition is completely reversible upon return to air, the patterns of entry of cells into S and mitosis being unaffected. The results of short air spurts on pushing cells through the cycle will also be described.",

Y.-ANAEROBIOSIS AND THE INITIATION OF CELL DIFFERENTIATION IN ROOT MERISTEM CELLs-During the course of experimentation designed to study variations in energy requirements in the mitotic cycle, it was discovered that prolonged anaerobiosis prevented initiation of chromosome replication and cell division of most but not all stationary phase G, and G2 cells. The present experiments were designed to localize and characterize the exceptional cells. This was accomplished with radioautography of squashed and sectioned material and scintillation counting. After establishment of the stationary phase by carbohydrate deprivation, excised Pisum root tips were provided sucrose ana cultured under N 3 for several hours. Scintillation counting showed tritiated thymidine was incorporated during anaerobiosis at a low but significant rate. Radioautographs of squash preparations indicated that incorporation occurred in a very small percentage of cells and radioautographs of sectioned material showed the labeled cells to be primarily the group that gives rise to the pericycle or cells closely associated with the pericycle. The results suggest that the metabolic machinery for or associated with differentiation may be present and operative soon after or even during the division of the meristematic initials.",

Two polyploid series of fern plants have been utilized, a gametophyte series and a sporophyte series, both of which have been produced by cultural techniques and maintained aseptically. Routine cytological examination of plants in each series indicates that individuals at every level of ploidy are characterized by a marked stability in chromosome number and, therefore, levels of nuclear DNA are also considered to be stable. With this material we have examined various cytological phenomena and physiological processes in cells where the amount of nuclear DNA is known, constant, and can be increased by substituting cells at higher levels of ploidy. Measurements of respiratory and photosynthetic activity of plants in each series are interpreted to show the extent to which these processes are influenced by ploidy levels. has been shown to exist between nuclear volume, DNA content, and minimum mitotic cycle time in several diploid species of plants. Evidence indicates that the synthesis of nuclear DNA may be a critical factor in regulating the duration of the mitotic cycle. The implication is that a cell which has to replicate twice the amount of DNA as another cell will take twice as long to complete the replication ( Van't Hof and Sparrow, 1963) . In animal tissue culture studies a dependence of synthesis time on nuclear DNA content has been recorded. However, the metabolic status of the culture may significantly alter the synthesis and total cell cycle times (Malamud, 1967) . 'To determine if similar correlations hold in a polyploid series of fern gametophytes (In, 2n, 4n) and sporophytes (2n, 4n) , the incorporation of a pulse of tritiated, thymidine was followed radioauto-. graphically for 72 hr in plants from each of the ploidy groups. Plants of Todea barbara wereremoved from sterile solid cultures and transferred to liquid media 3 weeks previous to pulsing. Pulsing was accomplished aseptically by adding tritiated thymidine to the medium (0.5~c/ml, sp act 2.0 C/mM) for.3 hr, followed by successive washes with lOOX unlabeled medium to remove unincorporated, thymidine. Plants were prepared for histological analysis, stained with Feulgen reagent and coated with, NTB-3 liquid emulsion. Estimates of chromosome number were\" recorded to verify the ploidy of the material and eliminate possible endopolyploidy, The pattern of labeled cells in mitosis in the meristern was examined to detect possible mitotis cycle time variations between different histological zones. The results of these studies will be. discussed with reference to ploidy, nuclear volume, meristematic zonation, and, minimum mitotic cycle time.

Calluses also appear o~decapitated plants. Using the Murashige and Skoog medium, calluses from colchicine-treated and from decapitated plants have been cultured in vitro. Callus tissue from the latter plants grows moderately well on Murashige and Skoog medium; callus from colchicine-treated plants, however, requires the addition of coconut milk (1.5%) or~,~-D (0..5 mg/liter).

North Carolina State University, Raleigh-TIME-LAPSE OBSERVATIONS ON DEVELOPMENT OF PHRAGMOPLASTS IN INDIVIDUAL PLANT CALLUS CELLS-Regardless of whether the cell was slightly or greatly elongated, the division figure could be either in a mass of cytoplasm at the center or adhering to a lateral wall. In the first case a meshwork of cytoplasmic strands extended outward from all sides of the two nuclei and connected with the peripheral cytoplasm. The cell plate developed outwardly through this cytoplasmic meshwork, which became a layer of cytoplasm extending to the lateral wall. When the division figure originated along a lateral wall there was an extension of a massive layer of cytoplasm between the derivative nuclei across the cell. Immediately back of this advancing front of cytoplasm was the developing edge of the cell plate. In neither case was a phragmosome developed prior to formation of cell plate. There was no conspicuous marginal enlargement of the phragmoplast as it developed across a dividing cell. When the cell plate reached the lateral wall it developsd a narrow edge which grew into a dissolved ridge of the original wall. The~ew. cell wall was deposited completely around the derivative protoplasts, yielding two cells separated by intercellular substances.

Various histochemical and ancillary techniques have been carried out at the light-microscope level to determine the nodular growth and activity from inception to time of leaf abscission. All visible nodules in leaves of different ages were punched out using a hypodermic needle and syringe. These nodules were then formed into pellets according to age and sectioned so that variations in both nodule orientation and activity could be observed. The bacterial mass within the nodule exhibits a strong uniform RNA reaction in very young and actively growing leaves. At maximum leaf enlargement this reaction decreases rapidly from nodule center to periphery and is negative at the time of leaf abscission. Other techniques indicate that nodule activity in some ways parallels leaf g~'owth and development. Elaboration of these results wJ!1 be presented.",

University of Leeds, Leeds, England-NucLEOLAR VACUOLES AS LIQUID CRYSTAU; IN PLANT CELLs-Homogeneous-appearing refractile regions of interphase nucleoli of plant cells (commonly referred to as vacuoles under bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy) show optical anisotropy under polarizing microscopy in a number of plant, genera (Zamia, Lilium, Citrus, Zea, Poncirus, and Pinu.5*) . The degree of double refraction increases with an increase in size of the nucleolar inclusions. In unstained squash preparations and paraffin sections and in st ained histological preparations the inclusions show a polarizutiou cross the shape of which varies with the shape of the inchl~ion (spherical, ovoid, cylindrical). Jn specially stained preparations the polarization cross is JlO longer evident and the inclusions manifest distinct bright and dark alternations when rotated between crossed polars, appearing to be optically active. The loss of the polarization cross in these stained preparations coupled with the bright and dark alternations during rotation between crossed polars indicate that the nucleolar inclusions are a two-component system consisting of a birefringent core surrounded by a birefringent envelope. The anisotropic properties of the nucleolar inclusions in stained and unstained preparations and their variability in size and shape indicate that they are liquid crystals, possibly of the cholesteric type. separately and in combination were investigated. Three hundred ppm BA proved toxic, and fatally so, except in the presence of 300 ppm GA. GA increased overall plant height, leaf area, leaf fresh weight and dry weight, chlorophyll and protein. The effect of GA on retarding leaf senes~ence is far less significant than the effect of BA. BA alone produced nonsignificant effects on overall plant height, but it increased significantly the leaf area. fresh weight and dry weight as well as the production of leaf chlorophyll and protein. The interaction between GA and BA, analyzed at the 5% level of probabilitv. produced significant, inorease III leaf area, fresh weight. and chlorophyll, and also significant retardation of leaf senescence. Their interaction had no significant effect on overall plant height, leaf dry weight, or leaf protein content. 4: 1. 5 Laetsch, W. M. University of California, Berkeley-SENEsCENCE IN TOBACCO LEAVES: RELATION OF THE LEVEL OF SENESCENCE TO BLEACHING AND PO-TENTIAl, FOR CELL DIVISION-It was previously found that 2-mm discs from mature tobacco leaves could be maintained in the dark on a sucrose and mineral medium for more than 3 months and that callus could be induced from such tissue. One part of the present study concerns the rate of chlorophyll loss in discs from very young leaves, partially green dark-grown leaves, and leaves in various stages of senescence. The other part concerns the potential of tissue which has senesced on the plant or in culture to proliferate. When discs from dark-grown leaves are placed in the light for 2 days, they have half the chlorophyll of discs from mature leaves. LIttle, If any, of this chlorophyll is lost when the discs are maintained in the dark for 2 weeks. Discs from mature leaves lose at least. .50% of their chlorophyll in the same time. Dis(;s from young leaves of light-grown plants also lose their chlorophyll in the dark much slower than older leaves. It app.ears that chlorophyll~urnover might ?e almost non-existent III young cells. DISCS from leaves III various stages of senescence were cultured in the dark on Murashige and Skoog medium. Discs from leaves with only 12% of their former chlorophyll content proliferated into 705 callus. Discs from the same series of senescent leaves were maintained in the dark for 3 weeks on sucrose and minerals and then placed on a complete medium. All these discs formed callus. When discs from mature leaves were bleached rapidly on agar in the dark and transferred to complete medium, they would not form callus if they had lost more than 60% of their chlorophyll. It is concluded that the senescence of intact tobacco leaves is largely a matter of limiting factors and that the initiation of irreversible degradative processes does not occur until the final stage of senescence. 'Templini' (variegated leaves) can be stimulated to subdivide. The cells so formed continue to divide producing first a mound of cells, and then, on leaves and stems, t.wo-stipulate leaves, and on peduncles, male flower primordia. The stimulus to division of epidermal cells is provided by injury to or partial removal of the root system. The number of outgrowths on a leaf blade may be as high as 4,000, on a petiole 500, on a stem internode in the thousands, and on a peduncle in the hundreds. None of the floral outgrowths produce fully developed flowers possibly because they do not live long enough-the peduncles abscise after 1-2 months, the plant being sterile. Many foliar outgrowths cease growing after a few months but remain alive as long as the leaf stays on the plant (1-2 years). Some foliar outgrowths on sterns are still living after 4 years. Most still have only one leaf of the bilaterally symmetrical juvenile begonia leaf form. No outgrowths on leaves and less than 1% of stem outgrowths develop a stem meristem and thus a succession of leaves, which though small are of the mature leaf form of this species. When a stem forms roots can be induced and a plantlet, separable from the parent plant, is formed. No vascular connection between the outgrowths and the parent plant ever develops. Instead a bulbous mass of xylem matures at the base of the outgrowth.",

The stinging cell is initiated first, br a protrusion of a single epidermal cell. The asymmetrica tip differentiates just after initiation. Further growth of the stinging cell is intercalary. Adjacent epidermal and hypodermal cells later divide and contribute to the pedestal. The nucleus of the stinging cell is about five times larger in diameter than nuclei of adjacent epidermal cells, suggesting polyploidy. The cytoplasm of the mature stinging cell contains numerous PAS-positive particles, several large vacuoles, and a greater amount of RNA than other epidermal cells. Other histochemical results during ontogeny will be discussed. Increased levels of succinic dehydrogenase in axils of some leaves, indicating sites of lateral bud initiation, are visible in late March. Bud primordia can be identified cytochemically as vegetative or reproductive by early June. During the 10 weeks following initiation, the fate of the bud primordia is not fixed. Some will abort and disappear completely, and others will cease development at a later stage and become latent. Only about half of.-j,he buds initiated fully develop. The proportion of developing buds which become vegetative or seed or pollen cones varies from tree to tree and from year to year'. Cytochemical differences between potentially vegetative and potentially reproductive apices have been studied. Levels of RNA, as indicated by pyronin-Y staining, are higher in reproductive than vegetative apices before these apices can be distinguished anatomically.",

Gibberellic acid in lanolin was applied to the base of the shoot tip of orthotropic shoots in concentrations of 50 and 1000 mg/liter, These applications resulted in a marked increase in shoot length and a significant increase in leaf number.

Application of eytokinins and indoleacetic acid at appropriate concentrations increases the number of buds formed on these root segments. A detailed anatomical comparison of induced buds for a wide range of concentrations of these growth substances has shown that all are endogenous in origin and are comparable structurally with buds normally occurring on roots of various species of Ophioaloseum. Each apical meristem, consisting of an apical cell and a few of its derivatives, appears somewhat sunken and is located below an air cavity formed by the breakdown of adjacent cortical cells. Leaf primordia are large in comparison to the small apical meristem, and vascular tissue differentiates basipetally in relation to them. Treatments with higher concentrations of benzyladenine and kinetin stimulate the root cortical tissue to proliferate into a callus-like outgrowth. Within this proliferation numerous bud apical meristems of normal anatomical structures are organized in close proximity. to each other. In addition, abnormally large starch-filled parenchyma cells are differentiated in root segments treated with high concentrations of kinetin.

The Rockefeller University, New York-THE EFFECT OF INHIBITORS, OF PROTEIN AND NUCLEIC ACID SYNTHESIS ON DIFFERENTIATION OF THE GAMETOPHYTE OF ANEMIA PHYLLITIDIs-Germination of spores of Anemia phyllitidis can be induced in the dark by gibberellic acid (GA3) . The inhibitors of RNA synthesis, fluorouracil, 8-azaguanine, and actinomycin D (AD), do not inhibit or delay this germination. The inhibitors of protein synthesis cycloheximide and pfluorophenylalanine do inhibit the GA3-induced germination. The effect of AD on GA3 induction of antheridia was also investigated. The spores were allowed to germinate in the light and then transferred to the dark, at which time AD and/or GA3 were added. At all concentrations of AD used (50-200 ,ug/ml), suppression of antheridium production was observed and found to be correlated with AD concentration. By contrast, vegetative growth in the absence of GA3, as measured by cell number, was not inhibited at these concentrations of AD. Division of the central cell of the antheridium and development of the sperm are inhibited by AD to a greater extent than in the induction of antheridia. If AD is present during GA 3induced dark germination, some delay in the first vegetative-cell division is observed. Development of rhizoids is inhibited and the formation of antheridia is suppressed to a greater extent than when AD is added after lightinduced germination. Experiments on the effect of these inhibitors on the synthesis of RNA and protein are in progress and will be discussed. These studies demonstrate that once the meiotic process has been initiated, it is possible to provide conditions which are adequate for completion of the cycle. However, initiation of the meiotic process in vitro and completion of the developmental events in culture remain rare events. This paper reports observations made on young fern plants of Todea barbara in which sporangial development, the occurrence of meiosis, and the production of viable spores were induced in vitro on a simple nutrient medium. Meiosis is initiated in the sporogenous cells and proceeds to completion in vitro with the formation of viable spores. Sporangial development, meiosis, and the production of spores occur in plants which exhibit signs of senescence. Fertile leaves are characterized by a reduction in chlorophyll concentration and total cellular nitrogen when compared to sterile leaves. The data suggest that the process of sporogenesis may be correlated with a reduction in metabolic activity of the leaf.",

In all cases buds enlarge slightly but significantly for a I-week period after the emergence of the epieotyl from the cotyledons. Following this all buds persist in an inhibited state. By clearing whole segments of tissue it has been possible to locate and measure bud traces in situ. Complete traces (continuous from the largest bud to the stem vascular bundle) first occur prior to the cessation of bud growth in seedlings exposed to white and red light. It takes as much as a week longer for complete trac(,s to appear in seedlings kept in the dark. This delay apparently results from a slower differentiation of xylem and from a disruption of the trace by stretching. Cases of disruption and repair of disruption through the formation of new xylem bridges will be described. These observations indicate that the presence of a complete bud trace is not necessarily a primary factor in the \"release\" of a bud from an imposed apical dominance. root tips were grown on an agar-solidified medium containing modified White's minerals, casein hydrolysate (500 ppm), tuber extract (10%) and 2,4-D (0.05 ppm), and the effect of blue light, red light and unfiltered white light on the chlorophyll formation were studied. The roots grown in white light turned green in color in 4-6 weeks, whereas in blue or red light, localized green color occasionally appeared. The chlorophyll contents, as determined by the acetone-extraction spectrophotometric method, were found to be the maximum in unfiltered light (21.1 nanograms/milligram), followed by blue (8.5 ng/mg) and red light (8.3 ng/mg.) In all the light treatments the chlorophyll a contents were higher than chlorophyll b; however, in red light this was' reversed.

They may be contrasted with the comparatively great histological response to wounding in the shoot apex, by the production of abundant cell divisions and new cells beneath a cut surface, and by the unlimited production of new foliar primordia by a shoot apex regenerated from a portion of an original one. globeberry were fixed for light and electron microscopy at several stages in the development of the mature fruit color. As the green fruits undergo maturation they pass through a very brief yellow stage, then through an extended orange stage, and they finally attain a deep red-orange in the ripe fruit. During this sequence very little change in size occurs. As the chloroplasts change to chromoplasts the original plastid structure is lost; thus at an intermediate stage only the plastid envelope and a few thylakoids are present. As development proceeds new series of thylakoids form in bands near the margin of the plastid and polyhedral fibrils begin to arise in the stroma. At first the fibrils are random in distribution, but they become ordered into bodies which increase in size. The bodies consist of several hundred hexagonally packed polyhedral filaments in arcuate arrays. The individual filaments are clearly polyhedral in cross section and of an undeterInined but extended length. With KMnO, fixation the fibrils are about 200 A in diam and show a distinct lumen about 50 A in diam; with glutaraldehyde-osmium fixation they are thinner and do not exhibit a lumen. As development progresses \"crystals\" begin to appear in the chromoplasts, In the light microscope these crystals consist of dense deposits of yellow or orange pigments and are largely responsible for the color of fruit. In the electron microscope the crystals are not homogenous but are complex structures which appear to be formed by the union of subunits initially found free in the stroma. As these crystals develop the paracrystalline arrays of fibrils diminish in size and number. Growth of the crystals causes modification of the plastid shape; when mature the plastids may be elongate, triangular or banjo-shaped.",

T., Jr. Iowa State University, Ames-SPOROPOLLENIN FORMATION AND SECRETION BY TAPETAL CELLS-Production and secretion of sporopollenin by tapetal cells in the form of granules, plaques or Ubisch bodies have been frequently observed in sporangia and anthers of the Embryophyta. The site of synthesis within tapeta is still questionable, however. Tapeta in Selaginella megasporangia and mierosporangia and Citrus anthers produce different types of sporopollenin monomers which, when secreted, polymerize into granules or plaques. Production of the monomers appears to be associated with the proliferation of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum during the tetrad and separate microspore periods. In Selaginella the tapetal walls remain intact during sporopollenin formation, whereas in Citrus these walls are dissolved away first. In Citrus Golgi vesicles then appear to fuse with the tapetal plasmalemma, depositing the monomers to the outside. These monomers polymerize, forming smooth, spherical sporopollenin granules. The monomers in Selaqinella sporangia appear fibrous at first; then they aggregate into granules or plaques in the locule. Sporopollenin in this form then accumulates on the spore exine, forming the sculptured pattern, while in Citrus the sporopollenin seems only to add to the sculptured pattern already produced by each microspore. The implication of these results will be compared with previous studies. o\\.EMANTHUS KATHERINAE Baker-During telophase of microspore mitosis, one set of chromosomes aggregates opposite the microspore aperture and is surrounded by very few organelles. The other chromatin mass and most of the cell's organelles lie adjacent to the aperture. Cellwall formation partitions the new pollen grain into two cells of unequal size, vegetative and generative. The generative cellia the smaller of the two and always lies opposite the aperture. Initially the wall which surrounds the generative cell is attached to the pollen wall. The nucleus is highly condensed and nucleoli are present. A scattering of mierotubules as well as mitochondria, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes can be seen in the cytoplasm. Following separation of pollen wall and generative wall, the generative cell moves towards the center of the pollen grain. At this time mierotubules become more abundant and are aften associated with areas of finely fibrous material. As the generative cell and its nucleus assume an elongated form, the chromatin becomes more highly condensed and nucleoli disappear. The microtubules become aligned along the wall with their long axes parallel to the long axis .of the cell. This arrangement of microtubules persists throughout pollen development and is also present when the generative cell has moved into the pollen tube. The absence of prolamellar bodies in chloroplasts of tissue cultures that have been grown in the dark and placed in the light on a normal medium has been previously reported. Although the chloroplasts that result are identical to those found in leaf tissue, the prolamellar body does not take part in their development. When dark-grown callus tissue is placed on a medium lacking kinetin, the plastids fail to develop into chloroplasts, but a structure similar to the prolamellar body is observed. Buds induced from callus tissue by high kinetin concentrations in the dark form etiolated shoot systems whose proplastids contain prolamellar bodies. The presence of the prolamellar body in the development of the chloroplast in these tissues may be determined by levels of cytokinins in the tissue.",

University of California, Santa Cruz-AsPECTS OF SPOROPHYTE DEVEL-OPMENT IN SPHAEROCARPOS DONNELLu-Ultrastructural and histochemical changes during sporophyte development . were studied with the aid of electron and light microscopy. The sporophyte consists of three parts: the foot, which is embedded within the gametophytic tissue; the seta or stalk; and the capsule, within which the spore mother cells and nutritive cells will eventually develop. The capsular cells are initially indistinguishable from one another. They: contain small vacuoles and abundant cytoplasm WIth numerous mitochondria, proplastids, some dictyosomes, endoplasmic reticulum which is often oriented in arrays parallel to the cell wall, and numerous vesicles which occur on both sides of the plasmalemma. Differentiation can first be detected ultrastructurally about 13 days after fertilization. By 15 days differentiation between spore mother celIs and nutritive cells is clearly discernible by light microscopy. At this time the nutritive cells are highly vacuolate, contain many plastids with much starch, and are often multinucleate. In contrast, the spore mother cells have an extremely dense cytoplasm fewer starch-containing plastids, and many lipid vesicles. The increase in volume of the spore mother celIs which occurs prior to meiosis appears to be caused by an increase in cytoplasmic components, particularly the lipid-containing vesicles, rather than by vacuolar expansion. internodal epidermis arises by a sequence of three cell divisions in short epidermal cells. The first two divisions, resulting in formation of two subsidiary cells, occur in the long epidermal cells on each side of a guard cell mother cell (GCMC). Microtubules occur in two bands adjacent to the GCMC wall where the subsidiary cell plate will join the parent cell wall. The third division (longitudinal) occurs in the GCMC, resulting in the formation of two guard cells. The cell plate usually fails to develop completely to the GCMC wall. This leaves a well-defined pore between the two guard cells. During development of subsidiary celIs, a single large vacuole forms in each cell. During guardcell differentiation, the nuclei become greatly elongated, small vacuoles form in the ends of these cells, and plastids with poorly developed grana lamellae become apparent. Atthe ends of the guard cells, the outer cell walls become substantially thickened. Numerous microtubules appear along the center portion of the wall common to the two guard cells. At this same locus, after the appearance of these microtubules, the wall forms a thick pad. Lysis of the middle lamella, which results in stoma formation, appears to occur concomitantly with this wall thickening. These observations indicate that subsidiary and guard cells of the stomatal apparatus, though similar in form and in the kinds of organelles present initially, follow remarkably divergent pathways of differentiation during development of the stomatal apparatus.

Now 10 months in culture, the cells display a rapid growth rate, do not differentiate organs, produce dense cell suspensions in liquid medium, develop prominent chloroplasts in the light, and when plated on an agar medium 40% or more of 1-5-celled units grow into multi-cellular colonies within 7 days. Studies in progress are aimed at further improving the growth rate, cell separation, and plating efficiency through manipulation of the nutrient medium and the environment. These cells have displayed the behavior described above for the past 5 months, and their nuclei are now aneuploid about the 4n number. In early passages when most cells had 2n or 4n nuclei, there was little cell separation and adventitious roots were produced prolifically. Just before roots ceased being produced by the main cell line, a subline was started using root tips or root segments as transfer inocula. The nuclei of root-tip cells by that time were all tetraploid. Placed in a medium containing auxin (routinely used in maintaining the root subline), these very slender roots branch freely, and after a lag period the branches elongate at a rate of about 1 cm per week. Large mats of roots are thus produced during a monthly subculture period. Factors influencing root development in this subline are being investigated.",

Several changes were noted in the treated plants. Those dealing with the long term changes in particular will be considered. In treated cabbages growing shoots had formed within 7-10 days. After 3 months calluses appeared on these plants. The calluses were first formed close to the site of treatment, but they have continued to form on growing shoots, where they grow out of leaf scars. Some calluses gave rise to root-like outgrowths, but these never exceeded 5 mm in length. Six months after the original colchicine treatment, shoots developed from calluses' some plants have produced several shoots. These growth changes are similar to those found in genetic tumors. The induction of abnormal growth cannot be attributed solely to the colchicine treatment since similar changes have occurred in cabbage plants that were decapitated when other plants were treated with colchicine. Tobacco (N. glaucalangsdorffii, amphidiploid plants) has also been treated with colchicine-lanolin paste. Teratomatas and lateral branches have formed on treated plants. The teratomatas have formed both at the apex of the treated shoot and below the first leaf. It is well known that this particular abnormality would develop on these hybrid plants after flowering, or can be induced by irradiating them. The fact that they are developing on young plants with 5-8 fully formed leaves that are also giving rise to lateral branches indicates that the change induced by colchicine is operative at a site unrelated to that involved in the induction of polyploid cells. These results suggest that a change occurs in the ability of shoot apices to control lateral bud formation. Such a change may be related to an effect on levels of growth factors.

Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., and University of Kentucky, Lexington-ISOLATION OF PHYCOBILISOMES-Previous evidence suggested that small granules (300-400 A diam) which are found attached to the chloroplast lamellae of Porphyridium cruentum contained phycobiliproteins. In order to. ascertain the nature of the granules and to see whether or not they indeed contained the phycobiliproteins, it was necessary to isolate them. The isolation procedure involved the use of electron micro-scopy, density gradient centrifugation, and spectrophotometry. Cells, suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.8, were disrupted in a French pressure cell. The material was then treated with 0.2% deoxycholate (10-15 min) to free the granules from the photosynthetic lamellae. Glutaraldehyde was subsequently added to stabilize their structure. Lamellar material and other cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the red supernatant was placed on a sucrose density gradient (0.2 M-2 M). Following centrifugation at 53,500 X (J in a swinging bucket rotor, phycobiliproteins were present in a top pink layer, right below the meniscus, and a purple layer, in the middle of the gradient. Samples were removed along the entire gradient and examined by electron microscopy. Granules were present only in the purple layer (middle). The absorption spectrum of this layer showed a broad major peak at 540-563 mIL (phycoerythrin) and a smaller peak at 620 mIL (phycocyanin). The top pink layer contained some dissociated subunits and other unidentified UV absorbing substances. Since the granules contained the phycobiliproteins they have been given the name phycobilisomes (phycobiliprotein bodies). It should be noted that the location of the phycobilisomes on the lamellae is significant, because the phycobiliproteins play an important role in photosynthesis by transferring excitation energy of absorbed light. Phycobilisomes have been observed in several members of the Rhodophyta and Cyanophyta.",

Light microscopic studies of these abnormalities reveal that cell division is halted but that cell enlargement continues, progressing apically into the former region of cell division. The resultant growth is not normal, however, in that polarity of cell enlargement is lost. Cells which would typically be elongate parallel to the vertical axis assume an isodiametric configuration, because of an abnormally large lateral expan-sion. Electron microscopic studies reveal that microtubules oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the root and located near the plasmalemma disappear from the cytoplasm during the colchicine treatment. It is suggested that these microtubules are responsible for polarity of cell enlargement in timothy roots and that their removal by colchicine permits the abnormal cell enlargement involved in \"C-tumor\" formation.

Various intermediate stages were examined for gross morphological changes and chloroplast ultrastructural differences. During early stages the leaves and stems turned a reddish-green, later pink, and finally yellowishwhite. If the plants were returned to lower light mtensities during intermediate stages in chlorosis, a regreening occurred. The ultrastructural changes in the chloroplasts followed a typical pattern of chromoplast formation: an accumulation of starch, followed by an increase in osmophilic droplets, accompanied by a breakdown of grana and intergrana lamellae.

In contrast to the surrounding lavers of cells in which the parenchyma has become highly sclerotic, the cell walls of the parenchyma in the region of the ventilation bands remain relatively unthickened.

Carpels of the family contain either three (dorsal, two ventrals) or five (plus two sub-marginal laterals) prominent bundles. Among the genera progressive reduction in ovary size and ovule number (many to one) is accompanied by: increased fusion of involute carpel margins and adaxial carpel surfaces to form partially to fully septate ovaries; progressive fusion between opposing ventral and lateral bundles of adjacent fused carpel margins. Ovule traces depart from ventral bundles. Ovaries of Liquidambaroideae, Rhodoleioideae, Bucklandioideae, and Disanthoideae are half-inferior, partially septate, and pluriovulate (many to few). Each carpel is supplied with three major bundles. In Rhodoleioideae, Bucklandioideae and Disanthoideae carpel walls also receive several minor supplementary bundles, some of which anastomose with the ventral bundles. The supplementary strands may represent diffuse lateral bundles. Modifications of vasculature are introduced both through adnation between ovary and hypanthium and through fusion of flowers into heads. Ovaries of Hamamelidoideae are superior to nearly in-ferior, and septate. Each carpel bears one (minus three) ovules and is supplied by five major bundles. The ventral and lateral bundles of each margin arise separately in the receptacle but fuse near the apex of the locule to form a single marginal bundle in the style. Among the Hamamelidoideae reduction and loss of a reeeptacular stele (absent in other subfamilies) is accompanied by increasing adnation between hypanthium and ovary followed by increasing adnation of hypanthial trunk bundles with dorsal and lateral carpel bundles, resulting in a diffuse ori~n of the lateral carpel bundles from adjacent hypanthial trunk bundles in advanced cases.

R., and Ernest Ball, North Carolina State University, Raleigh-ORIGIN OF PERIGYNY IN PORTULACA GRANDIFLoRA-Ontogeny of sepals through carpels occurs on the flanks of the floral apex in the manner of a hypogynous flower. During the maturation of the floral appendages, the tissues subjacent to all except the carpels undergo growth in the vertical direction by cell divisions and cell stretching, causing the attachment positions of these organs to assume the form of the edges of a bowl, at the bottom of which the carpels undergo their fusions and maturation. This perigyny is thus ontogentically late in development and may be interpreted as a derived condition. It contrasts fundamentally with the perigyny of Spiraea ulmaria as described by Gregoire, in which the bowl-shaped form of the floral apex was assumed prior to the origin of the floral appendages. Under uniform growing conditions stem length has varied by as much as 230%, shape of the leaf base has ranged from simple to crested, and root systems formed have been much stronger on some plants than on others of the same age. Difference in stem length has been related to point of origin on the parent leaf. An explanation based on differing hormonal balance is substantiated by the fact that the first plantlets to appear on attached leaves do not produce roots until those which appear later have produced numerous roots. General Section-continued genesis of these divergent leaf types; one interpretation suggests that the extensive radial growth early in foliar development of unifacial origins results from extensive divisional activity in an adaxial meristem, while the other states that unifacial leaves exhibit a sympodial growth pattern with the early radial expansion resulting from growth activity of the primary leaf apex which becomes arrested early in its development. Subsequent longitudinal growth is then interpreted to proceed from a secondary leaf apex which arises from the abaxial side of the primordium. Both types of leaf development have been described in various groups of monocotyledonous plants and have been considered as non-homologous developmental patterns. Detailed comparative analysis of early foliar development in five different populations of Acorus calamus indicates that the distinctions between these two developmental patterns are merely the results of quantitative differences in the extent of expression and time of onset of adaxial meristematic activity, as well as the distribution of growth in the derivative zones, of the shoot apex. Because both ontogenetic patterns can be found in different populations of the same species and they fall within the range of quantitative variations in the distribution and timing of growth of unifacial organs, it is suggested that these hitherto contrasting developmental patterns be considered homologous.",

The tracheary elements studied are long, slender, essentially scalariform ones with long, sloping end walls.

In the second half of the 19th century some well-known American botanists, for example Asa Gray, William Beal, and Liberty Hyde Bailey, wrote botanical works designed for children.

Some of these transformations were the result of scribal carelessness and dialectal peculiarities. Others, however, were caused by a deep-seated confusion concerning the nature and identity of the 'plant whose name or names originated in classical antiquity. As a consequence error was introduced in medieval botanical literature by nomenclatural changes and w!l;s perpetuated by the li~erary forms (commentaries, glossaries, etc.) used by medieval botanical writers. In the myxomycete Didymium iridis (Ditmar) Fries vegetative or plasmodial fusion is controlled by a compatibility system consisting of several loci. On the other hand, mating capacity is determined by an i-locus multiple allelic system in which all heteroallehc crosses are fertile. The operation of this system is such that each plasmodium from heterothallic isolates typically carries a different pair of mating-type alleles. Vegetative fusions which bring together non-identical pairs of mating factors are apparently rare, probably because of dissimilarity in the plasmodial compatibility systems of the various isolates. In the laboratory appropriate interisolate crosses sometimes yield hybrids which are genetically sufficiently similar to allow for occasional production of mating type heterokaryons by means of plasmodial fusion. A heterokaryon composed of AIA2and A2A\u00b7 nuclei was induced to sporulate and recovery of the 3 factors was attempted. Retrieval of A 2 and A\u00b7 in a 1: 1 ratio suggests that only A2A4 nuclei survived to become incorporated in spores. In view of this, heterokaryons were produced in which there was a 4: 1 and 10: 1 size difference in favor of the AlA2 plasmodium. Even under these conditions only As and A\u00b7 mating types were recovered. The broad implications of heterokaryosis and nuclear selection as they r~late to certain aspects of myxomycete life cycles will be discussed.",

The sectors are all incompatible with the normal mycelium but show a high degree of compatibility when mated with each other. Three of the sectors which are compatible in all combinations with each other were produced by the same normal dikaryon (Ax Bx:Ay By). It appears that both the A and B incompatibility factors. of the normal mycelium have either mutated or have been modified by some mutation at another locus, since a change in only one of the incompatibility factors would not account for the origin of such a series of sectors. Basidiospores which are produced from compatible crosses of the sectors show a regular tetrapolar pattern when crossed with each other or when backcrossed to the parents. The progeny show the same incompatibility with the normal mycelium as did their parents. The fruiting structures produced by compatible combinations of sectors are nothing more than coralloid or raduloid structures a few mm high and are completely lacking a stalk or pileus. The basidia and basidiospores of the sectors have the same morphology and dimensions as the basidia and basidiospores of the normal fruits.

Clark University, Worcester, MasS.-ULTRASTRUCTURE OF THE LICHEN ALGA Tnnaorrxrx-c-Ultraetructural studies are being conducted on lichens and the isolated lichen symbionts. The purpose of this paper is to describe one phase of this work, namely, the ultrastructure of the phycobiont Trebouxia. This genus previously has been separated into two groups with the aid of the light microscope. In group 1, which is found in fruiticose lichens, the divided chloroplast fragments assume a parietal position in the cell. In group 2, found commonly in foliose and crustose lichens, the divided chloroplast fragments retain a central position in the cell. Other differences can be found at the ultrastructural level. Group 1 Trebouxia are found to have the normal chlorococcoid pyrenoid, while group 2 species have a highly vesiculate, stellate-shaped pyrenoid with small electron-dense bodies scattered throughout. The core of the group 2 pyrenoids has a lamellar structure. The two groups differ also in their arrangement of starch granules around the pyrenoid, organization of chloroplast lamellae, and the size and distribution of mitochondria. A. peruviana is homothallic: however, the morphology of this organism is different from all other isolates identified as Anixiops1:Sand its inclusion in this genus is questionable. Forty isolates of organisms identified as belonging to the genus Anixiopeis are under study. Single ascospore isolations indicate that 20 of these isolates are homothallic and 20 are heterothallic, Clones established from each of the heterothallic isolates were crossed among themselves. The results of these crosses show the existence of a singlelocus, two-allele mating type system in all 20 heterothallic isolates. When clones from the individual isolates were crossed to clones from the other isolates, the results indicated the existence of at least four different genetic groups. Studies are being conducted that show morphological differences also exist that correspond to the genetic groups. Morphological studies of the homothallic isolates are also being conducted. 'Red Kidney' to simazine (2 chloro-4, 6-bis ethylamino-S-triazine) and kinetin was tested. The plants were analyzed with respect to the length of the leaves and stems, the number of flowers, and the number and size of nodules. A three-factorial analysis was performed combining the herbicide at 5 X 10-5 M and 5 X 10-6 M, kinetin at 9 X 10-7 and 9 X 10-8 M, and the presence and absence of Rhizobium phaseoli in all possible combinations. At both concentrations of simazine, nodulation was inhibited. However, at either kinetin concentration formation of nodules was evident. The actual mechanism of induction is unknown. A comparison was made between groups which were simultaneously treated with kinetin, simazine, and an inoculum of Rhizobium phaseoli ATCC 14482. The nodules formed by species of Rhizobium are different from the pseudonodules induced in tobacco roots. Simazine (5 X 10-6 M) caused chlorosis in plants. Chlorosis was also observed 2-3 weeks later with 5~X 10-6 !f simazine with the action site being the mesophyll areas of the leaf. No antagonistic effects were observed with application of kinetin. parasitic on an unidentified myrtaceous leaf. A comparison at Beltsville of the Indian material with the type of Phaeofabrea miconiae Rehm, until now known only from four collections from Brazil and Venezuela, proved the two to be identical. There are two additional species in the genus: P. lachnoides (Rehm) Sydow from Brazil and Costa Rica and P. leonensis Sydow from Sierra Leone. All Phaeofabrea spp. are hyperparasites of Phyllachoraceae, a family of stromatic pyrenomycetes. Contrary to the previous published accounts, the ascospores of P. miconiae are unseptate. The \"septum\" of these authors is a hyaline cytoplasmic band in the equatorial region of the otherwise brown ascospore. As the ascospore matures an inner secondary wall is deposited except in this equatorial region. The pigmentation in the primary wall also becomes denser, making it somewhat more conspicuous than the inner wall. The hyaline band in the ascospore is also characteristic of the other two species of Phaeofobrea, PALEOBOTANICAL SECTION [Vol. 55 Session 7. Tuesday Afternoon. C. B. BECK, presiding.",

University of Illinois, Chicago Circle-THE SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE, A NEW RESEARCH TOOL IN PALEOBOTANy-The development of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides a new method of examination and interpretation of surface features of plant microfossils and microdetails of macrofossils. Its availability reduces limitations of resolution, depth of field, and maximum magnifications available imposed by light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes provide greater depth of field, higher magnifications and resolution than light microscopes, but are limited because of the necessity of using thin specimens or vapor-deposited replicas of specimen surfaces. The scanning electron microscope combines advantages of both light and transmission electron microscopes and is particularly adapted to the examination of solid specimens having minute surface features. In addition, the twoaxis rotational capability of the specimen stage of the scanning electron microscope allows one specimen to be viewed and photographed at several different angles. Magnifications from 14 to 100,000 times are available, with the depth of field being 500 times that of the light microscope. Scanning electron microscopy depends upon the collection of secondary electrons which are emitted from the surface upon the impingement of higher energy primary electrons. Voltages range from 1.5 kv to 20 kv, thus making it possible to investigate materials which would be destroyed by the 50 kv, or higher, voltages of conventional electron microscopes. A further significant feature is the possibility of preparing stereopictures.

The units in the chains are thought to be similar to those of glucuronic acid. Like fossil sporopollenin, that separated from modern pollen is very sensitive to oxidation. Treatment with H 202 solutions quickly breaks down beet-pollen exines that had withstood weeks of attack by hot mineral acids and bases. The extraordinary resistance of beet-pollen exines to degradation possibly accounts for the abundance of fossil chenopod pollen in various sediments. Ohio) .

University of California, Los AngeleS-PRECAMBRIAN MICROORGANISMS FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA-8tromatolitic black cherts from the Late Precambrian Bitter Springs Formation of the central Australian Amadeus Basin contain a diverse assemblage of exceptionally well-preserved filamentous and spheroidal plant microfossils. Some 30 species of green and bluegreen algae, bacteria, probable fungi and other microorganisms are indigenous to this approximately 1,000million-year-old deposit. Certain of the spheroidal green algae of the assemblage contain structures interpreted as representing partially degraded nuclei; these chlorococcoid algae appear to be the oldest eucaryotic organisms now known. Although many of the microorganisms are rather dissimilar from modern thallophytes, several of the Bitter Springs algae are comparable in morphological detail to extant Cyanophytes, In particular, microorganisms resembling members of the following genera are represented: Lyngbya, Oscillatoria, Microcoleus, Spirulina, Anacystis, and perhaps Anabaenopsis. On the basis of lithologic similarity and stratigraphic position, the Bitter Springs Formation has been correlated with the Late Precambrian Skillogalee Dolomite of the Adelaide Geosyncline. Septate, apparently heterocystous algal filaments, spheroidal algal unicells, and a distinctive ascus-like microfossil of uncertain systematic position have been detected in cherty units of this South Australian formation. Although the Skillogalee filaments appear to be conspecific with one of the Bitter Springs blue-green algae, the evolutionary conservatism exhibited by the Bitter Springs cyanophytes indicates that these organisms are probably unreliable \"index fossils\"; the occurrence of this alga in both deposits is not necessarily indicative of temporal equivalence. These two Australian assemblages of organically and structurally preserved microorganisms provide additional links in the rapidly expanding knowledge of Late Precambrian organisms and their evolutionary status.",

The presence of clamp connections is a structural characteristic occurring at present only in the class Basidiomycetes. This structure, which insures that sister nuclei from a conjugate division of a dikaryon become properly separated into daughter cells, is an integral part of the basidiomycete life cycle. The occurrence of clamps is direct evidence of the existence of the dikaryotic stage in the life cycle of the Basidiomycetes, and as such supports the premise that the characteristic life cycle of the Basidiomycetes was probably evolved to a point comparable to that of modern fOrIDS by the middle of the Pennsylvanian Period. This provides the first indisputable evidence of the presence of Basidiomycetes in the Paleozoic.",

Two other spineless plants are probably referable to Psiwphyton: (1) A small, dichotomously forking plant with axes up .to about 2 mm in diam; the specimens are abundantly fertile and bear numerous paired sporangia at the tips of the ultimate branchlets, (2) A somewhat larger plant of monopodial habit with axes up to 3 mm in diam; this occurs in great abundance through several inches of rock at one locality, but sporangia have not been observed. One of the most interesting members of the flora is a rather stoutly spiny plant exhibiting Il-branching and with laterally-arranged sporangia about 6 mm in diam. The general habit resembles that of Zosterophyllttm except that it is spiny and the sporangia are borne on conspicuous stalks.

The spores are monolete, oval in outline, and range from about 100 to 135,.. in overall length. The exine has distinct separation of its layers and the ektexine is sculptured with conspicuous spinae. The monolete suture exhibits angular deviation near its center, as in Schopfipollenites Potonie and Kremp (1954) which is an associated constituent of the small-spore assemblage. The general morphological features of the new spore indicate a probable relationship to the Medullosaceae, a family of Paleozoic pteridosperms. Stigmaria, anatomically distinct from the well-known S. ficoides, has been found in coal balls from the Upper Pennsylvanian of Illinois. The new species is characterized by having a dissected siphonostele with a central parenchymatous pith. The exact outline of primary xylem cannot be determined and no direction of differentiation can be recognized at present. Apparently the primary and certainly the secondary xylem are dissected by gaps associated with the departure of vascular traces to lateral appendages (rootlets). These gaps appear ovate to orbicular in tangential sections of the secondary xylem which is predominantly multiseriate. Both primary and secondary cortical tissues are present. The primary cortical tissues are typical of those of other forms of Stigmaria; however, the secondary cortical tissues are almost identical with those known to have been produced in aerial stems of Sigillaria. The deeper secondary cortex appears to have been produced by one or more meristematic zones at the inner margin. An alternative method of designating cortical zones which does not imply a comparison of secondary cortex of lycopods with the periderm of seed plants is presented. Lateral appendages or rootlets, borne in a spiral arrangement on the axis, are characterized by having a monarch collateral bundle suspended in the hollow middle cortex of the appendage by a parenchymatous connective for the entire length of the free appendage. The parenchyma bridge and outer cortex of the appendage contain a branched system of tracheids in connection with the xylem of the appendage bundle. Abscission of the lateral appendages occurs, and the abscission zone produced has a distinct and consistent histology and configuration. The new species forms a well-defined anatomical type which may be distinguished from Stigmaria ficoides on the basis of features of the primary xylem, secondary xylem, primary and secondary cortical tissues, and the histology and mode of abscission of the lateral appendages.

Indiana University, Bloomington-REvISION OF EOCENE PALMS FROM SOUTHEASTERN NORTH AMERICA BASED UPON CUTICULAR ANALYSIS-Incomplete fragments of palm foliage have always presented a problem to paleobotanists. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to give a meaningful generic determination of such fragmentary fossil material. Only by a comparison of the arrangement of the venation of such fossil fragments with the venation of more completely preserved specimens have attempts been made to use such fragmentary material. However, since the parallel venation of the lamina of palms is often not unique to any particular genus, the determinations based upon venation of leaf fragments is generally not satisfactory. Several fragments of palm leaves and a few nearly complete leaves have been collected from Eocene deposits of western Tennessee. Most of this fossil material has good cuticle preservation and the leaf fragments can be easily related by cuticular analysis to the more complete leaves which have been found. On the basis of venation and gross morphology, the palm leaves and leaf fragments studied can be identified as either Chamaedorea danai or Sabalites grayanus which Berry (1916, 1930) recognized in these deposits. However an investigation of the cuticular material indicates that there are three types of fossil palms present. The similarities of these fossil leaves and their cuticular features to modern palms indicates that two of these fossil palm types have close affinities with the Sabiloid palms and one fossil palm type has affinities with the Chamaedoroid palms.",

The reconstruction of any reasonable picture of the character of vegetation and plant-community organization in areas surrounding such a sedimentary depo-sitional area on the basis of distribution ot spores and pollen is not possible, because whole plant communities containing a wide variety of plants, as well as many individual species from partially represented communities, are not represented or are only sparsely represented. The causes of the disproportionate representation of palynomorphs are many, but some of the more significant are: (1) wind pollination vs. insect pollination (wind pollination is virtually a prerequisite for distribution at any distance from the parent plant, even though water may be equally or more important as an agency of transportation); (2) the durability factor, i.e., the differential degree or rate of degradation and destruction of palynomorphs (this is extremely variable for different species and even for whole groups of plants); (3) energy conditions both in transportation and at depositional sites and periodicity of effective movement by transporting media (such energy peaks or maxima as storms, tidal waves, seasonal winds and floods have much greater effect than 'average\" conditions); and (4) re-cycling of sediments. Some palynomorphs show high concentrations coincident with distribution of clays, at delta mouths, and in the vicinity of or in front of submarine channels. Low concentrations occur along some shores because of dilution by terrigenous sediments (rate of sedimentation), winnowing and penecontemporaneous re-cycling (affected by energy conditions, geomorphology of the basin, ete.). Some palynomorphs decrease in percentage offshore and others show increase in relative percentages (the result of greater durability and inherent hydrodynamic or aerodynamic properties); none show increase in absolute frequency beyond the shelves.

Relatively extensive specimens allow adequate characterization of the fertile portions of the Arkansas material. A basal axis bears primary laterals alternately.

Only seed plants have fertile structures of this complexity, but the anatomy of the fertile structures is unknown and their external morphology is still subject to divergent interpretation. Mrs. Plumstead believed them to be bisexual, but this now seems doubtful; she postulated ontogenetic stages that must be reevaluated. The new morphologic interpretation is based on study of additional material. Probably all glossopterid fructifications are unisexual. They consist of a fleshy, dorsiventrally flattened, capitulate head (sporophyll?) mounted on a stalk which, in its proximal portion, is adnate to a leafy bract. Except for a much greater resemblance of subtending bracts to foliage leaves, this arrangement is most comparable to the bract and axillary fertile shoot of cordaitaleans, Nevertheless, a great phyletic gap separates the glossopterids from the cordaitaleans, The glossopterids probably constitute a separate and rather isolated order, a precocious and specialized group, among the ancient coniferophytes. Comparison with other groups of Paleozoic seed plants shows that in most respects the Glossopteridales are advanced and specialized. Among coniferophytes, their net-veined foliage is not as advanced as that of modern Gnetum, and it seems unlikely that the glossopterids bear any more relationship to modern flowering plants than Gnetum. Variations on the theme of dichotomous reticulate nervation have been duplicated many times in the evolution of leaves in terrestrial vegetation. Jurassic from the Mixteca Alta in Oaxaca, Mexico, yield an abundance of foliage that most closely resembles the Late Paleozoic genus Glossopteris. Associated fossils, namely cycadophytic foliage and ferns, are not characteristic Gondwanaland forms, however. If the Mexican leaves are truly Glossopteris, then the geographic and geologic ranges of the genus are considerably extended. Although morphologically indistinguishable from Permian glossopterids, these leaves might be best viewed as biologically . distinct from the Paleozoic forms. This situation, along with the fact that there are a number of kinds of glossopterid fructifications, suggests that Glossopteris is only a form genus.",

Indiana University, Bloomington -SEQUOIA, AN ELEMENT OF THE EOCENE FLORA IN SOUTHEASTERN NORTH AMERICA-A reinvestigation of the lower Eocene flora from the southeastern states described by E. W. Berry in 1916 and revised by him in 1930 has been undertaken. This reinvestigation focuses particular attention on the fine venation and the frequently preserved cuticular material of these fossils in addition to the more general diagnostic leaf characters used by Berry. Additional fossil material has been collected from the western Tennessee Eocene clay deposits which Berry studied. A preliminary survey of this material indicates that several revisions should be made concerning the affinities of these fossil leaves with modern taxa. Leafy shoots of gymnospermous material similar to the fossils identified by Berry as Taxodium dubium and Taxites ? sp, were studied in this investigation. The leaves of the fossil material are attached to the axis spirally which is characteristic of Taxus, Taxodium and Sequoia. Because these three genera all have spiral leaves which are arranged distichously on the shoots it is often somewhat difficult to determine if compressed leafy shoots are most similar to Taxodium, Taxus, or Sequoia. However, the epidermal features of these genera are quite characteristic. The papillate epidermal cells of Taxus differ conspicuously from the non-papillate epidermal cells of Taxodium and Sequoia and the irregular transverse arrangement of the stomata of Taxodium is quite different from the longitudinally oriented stomata of Sequoia. The fossil material has cuticle preserved which was used in this study. The disposition of the stomata on the upper and lower epidermis, the nature of the epidermal cells and the accessory cells, and the longitudinal orientation of the stomata of the fossil material is nearly identical to that found in modern Sequoia semperuirens. The leafy shoots of Sequoia sempernirens commonly have smaller basal leaves and a terminal bud. Several of the fossil leafy shoots also show these characters. Therefore, on the basis of observations of the gross morphological and cuticular characters it is suggested that Sequoia was present in southeastern North America during the Eocene.",

Washington State University, Pullman-LEAF CUTICLES OF MIOCENE T AXODIUM DUBIUM FROM CENTRAL WASHINGTON -Leaf epidermal cell patterns from cuticles of living species of Taxodium are compared with those of Miocene T. dubium (Sternberg) Heer, collected near Rock Island, Wash. The cuticle of T. dubium provides conclusive evidence that it is specifically distinct from living species and suggests that it was likely the ancestor of T. mucronaium Ten. as well as of T. distlchum (L.) Rich., with which it has usually been compared. Leaf cuticles offer a feasible way to trace the evolutionary history of the genus Taxodium with some precision, though lack of a biosystematic study of the living species hinders interpretation. have a maximum diam of 2.5 em. Numerous scales are arranged spirally around the axis and each scale bears two winged seeds. The bract sub tending the ovuliferous scale is 3 mm long and is free from the scale throughout its length. The pith and cortex of the axis are constructed of thick-walled parenchyma cells and 18-21 resin ducts occur in the cortex. Those resin ducts entering the base of the cone scale are restricted to the abaxial side with vascular tissues occupying the adaxial side. At the tip of the cone scale is a broadly rhomboidal apophysis with a raised umbo that terminates in a stout spine. The shape of the cone, its anatomical features, and the morphology of the tip of the cone scale indicate closest affinity with the section Pseudosirobue of the subgenus Diploxylon. This is the first sp'ecies of structurally preserved pinaceous cones to be described from the Tertiary of North America, and these fossils indicate that cone structure characteristic of recent members of the subgenus Diploxylon had evolved by the Lower Oligocene. TRACHEID CELL WALLS-In many physiological investigations of ion uptake and water transport there is the assumption that available free space exists in the plant cell wall; however, there are no estimates or measurements of the actual amount of free space within the cell wall. In addition the amount of wall material itself, i.e., the cell-wall density, is an important parameter, particularly with respect to the mechanical strength of cells. Combining two-wavelength microspectrophotometry and interference microscopy, methods were developed to determine the amount of free space and cell wall density. The microspectrophotometric procedure requires the introduction of a chromophore and techniques were developed using the periodic acid-Schiff reaction. Validation of the method including hydrolysis times, staining schedules, Lambert's law tests, effects of vacuum desiccation and compression are presented, and preliminary measurements of the free space in tracheid cell walls of Pinus resinosa Ait. are tabulated.",

Emphasis is placed on the movement and metabolism of sucrose and IAA in the section. When the embryonic root is removed by a slanting cut, the root always forms at the tip of the slanting cut, suggesting the accumulation of morphogenetic materials there. Polar auxin movement is demonstrable in the sections. On 2% sucrose medium, 10-6 M IAA promotes the number of sections producing roots as well as the number of roots per section. More than twice as much auxin is transported by sections pretreajedby IAA than by those grown on 2% sucrose alone: When the sucrose level in the medium is raised to 10%, IAA does not promote regeneration. Sections grown on high sucrose produce more roots than those on low sucrose. Thus high sucrose (10%) or low sucrose (2%) + 10-6 M IAA both promote rooting when compared to 2% sucrose alone. An interaction between sucrose, IAA, and root formation is suggested and is being investigated.",

University of California, Davis-BIDIRECTIONAL TRANS-LOCATION OF K-FLUORESCEIN IN THE PHLOEM-When K-fluorescein (0.1%) was taken up through lightly scraped areas on the leaves or stems of Vicia [oba, it was found to be translocated exclusively in the phloem. The youngest fully expanded leaves exported the dye into the stem where it moved in both directions, some entering the root system and some entering immature leaves. Mature leaves were bypassed. The same pattern of translocation .was also found using CU-assimilate as a tracer, indicating similar transport behavior for the two tracers. A study of the vascular system of V. [oba revealed that. the bundles usually do not divide or anastomose in the internodes. Fluorescein applied to the middle of the internode below the youngest fully expanded leaf was found both above and below the site of dye entry. After a short treatment time, the dye was present in different bundles in each area, indicating that movement within a bundle occurred only in one direction. After a longer time interval which allowed a lateral movement of fluorescein at the nodes, the dye could be observed in the same bundle both above and below the treated area in a number of cases. These results were confirmed by treating stems of Phaseolus vulgaris, Pelargonium sp., and Vinca rosea, and petioles of Ecballium elaterium. It is concluded that individual sieve tubes as well as bundles conduct unidirectionally.",

Southern Illinois University, Carbondale-ON THE EFFECTS OF DMSO IN CATION TRANSPORT BY EXCISED BARLEY ROOTs-Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in concentrations of up to 10% by volume stimulates the uptake of zinc by excised barely roots. In the same concentration it severely depresses uptake of sodium and of rubidium. It does not seem to affect the permeability of the membrane, since roots treated with desorption solutions which were 10% in DMSO did not lose more of the preferred ion than did roots desorbed in solutions not containing DMSO. Oxygen utilization (measured in the Warburg respirometer) was reduced when DMSO was present. It is suggested that DMSO is a poisoning agent which interferes with cation transport by attacking some aspect of metabolism and not by influencing the permeability of the membrane. TREEs-Radioisotopes are being used to measure rate and pattern of water movement in Pinus contorta and Abies magnifica. Purpose of the study is to develop a method for estimating the volume of water transported through tree stems under given conditions. Experiments have been conducted in the snow zone of the Sierra Nevada in different seasons. Injections into 60-year-old trees were made by immersing ellQ-S of small lateral roots, in situ, into vials of phosphorus-32 solution. Rate of upward movement was monitored with a portable scintillation detector, and pattern of movement was determined from radioautographs. Midwinter rates averaged 0.3-1.3 ern/hr. Some movement occurred even during periods of harsh weather. During spring and summer upward movement of the transpiration stream was as fast as 2 m/hr, No consistent differences between species were found. The channel of ascent in both species was narrow, and the paths of radioactivity tended to spiral dextrally. In the lower part of the boles the isotope was concentrated in the outer 2-3 em of sapwood, but radioactivity was found as deep as 6-8 cm during periods of rapid ascent. Techniques of injection and measurement are being improved in current studies in an effort to inject and measure radioisotopes in the tree sys.tem without affecting the physiology of the stem. Radioautography of~llcrotome sections is being used in an attempt to determine actual fiber-cavity space utilized in water transport under various environmental conditions.",

In order to further test the thesis that protein conformational changes imposed upon the enzyme by the matrix affect characteristics of the enzy~e activity, other supports have been used. Ethylene-malic acid copolymer, aminopolystyrene, and polyvinylamine have been covalently bonded to potato apyrase (from Sigma Chern. Co.). Properties of the solid-supported enzyme differed from the soluble activity and the seve.ral enzyme-matrix complexes exhibited properties which were different from each other. The level for optimal activation by calcium is 10-2 M for the polyvinylamineenzyme complex, 10-1 M for CMC azide-enayme complex; other preparations were identical with the soluble enzYIJ?-e in this character. K m values are: 0.09 mM for apyrase in solution; 0.63 mM for CMC azide-apyrase; 2.26 mM for polyvinylamine-apyrase; 2.35 mM.for E-MA copolymerapyrase; and 1.18 mM for ammopolystyrene-apyrase. OXYGEN-A few 1O-25-cm-long segments of excised apple branches with bark from 1 to 4 mm thick enclosed in an unventilated but slightly permeable polyethylene bag will naturally generate and maintain an atmosphere saturated with moisture and containing approximately 2% oxygen, 25% carbon-dioxide and 25 to 50 PPJ.ll of ethylene after a few days at room temperature. Within a week numerous white puffy masses of large, thin-walled (ells will protrude from the lenticles on the surface of the branches. Such proliferation continues for several weeks or longer if contamination can be avoided, and it may eventually involve vigorous meristematic activity that results in soft spongy succulent sheets of new cells between the several bands of periderm, while the outer thin brown layer is separated and splits off. The sheets of new cells remain white and turgid so long as the atmosphere remains humid, but they collapse and turn brown and powdery soon after exposure to dry air. However, no callus will be formed from the vascular cambium exposed at the cut edges of the segments unless the bag is ventilated through a few punctures, 1-3 mm III diam, Such ventilation can be adjusted to cause an increase of ?xygen in the enclosed atmosphere to about 10 to 15%, With the carbon dioxide falling to around 10%, and with ethylene remaining at a level of approximately 20 ppm without reducing the humidity too much. If an appropriate oxygen level and high humidity are provided at the outset and maintained throughout a period of several weeks, little or no proliferation from the bark tissues occurs, but abundant callus will be formed from the exposed vascular cambium, and a few latent buds will push out to produce short leafy shoots. The unexposed cambium between the phloem and the xylem becomes slippery and active enough to allow easy separation of .bark and wood~t all levels of oxygen that keep the tissue alive, even m the absence of active shoot growth from the latent buds. Ethylene naturally produced by the branch segments seems to be responsible for the initiation of meristematic activity, which can be greatly increased by enclosing a small apple in the bag, or by the introduction of a minute quantity of pure ethylene.",

The manner in which GA treatment arrested senescence in tomato leaf discs may be similar to that shown by other growth regulators such as kinetin and auxin. It is suggested that retardation of senescence by GA in this case may be associated with the maintenance of DNA as a functional template for DNA-dependent synthesis of RNA. The effect of boron in retarding senescence may be related to its effect on sugar and starch balance, translocation of sugar, water balance, or perhaps nucleotide and protein metabolism in plants. Boron may play an important role in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acids. -The factorially designed experiment was designed to determine the effects of any interaction between boron (5.0 X 10-6 and 5.0 X 10-8 M), gibberellic acid (3.5 X 10-3 and 3.5 X 10-4 M) and kinetin (1.0 X 10-5 and 1.0 X 10-6 M) on the senescence of partially expanded leaf discs of Solanum aculeatissimum Jacq. Osborne (1962) demonstrated retardation of both protein loss and chlorophyll degradation in kinetin-treated leaf discs of Xanthium. Beevers (1966) demonstrated that nasturtium-leaf discs floated in gibberellic-acid solutions showed less than a 10% loss of chlorophyll and delayed decrease of RNA content. Gross morphological studies and analyses for chlorophyll, protein, RNA, and DNA demonstrated that discs treated with gibberellic acid, boron and kinetin in both high and low concentrations exhibited an initial increase of size, protein, chlorophyll concentration, RNA and DNA. This period of increase in activity was about 72 hr. It appeared that gibberellin and boron both affected the senescence phenomena. After 7 days the gibberellin and boron (in combination)-treated discs, on the average, demonstrated greater retardation of the manifestations of senescence. Kinetin, when acting in combination with gibberellin and/or boron, seemed to inhibit the aforementioned phenomena. It appeared that boron (5.0 X 10-8 M) when combined with kinetin retarded to a lesser extent the senescence phenomna than other combinations. Session 1. Thursday Afternoon. GRAEME P.",

Preliminary results indicate that changes m protein components occur when two compatible calli are grown together as compared with those extracted from the pure components. In mixed calli, certain proteins which had occurred in pure cultures were missing, and conversely new proteins appeared which had not been in the pure cultures. This effect has also been clearly demonstrated with the isozymes of certain dehydrogenases and esterases. In total darkness the leaf showed three movement phases. During the first phase the leaf assumed the down position and exhibited small irregular movements. This phase averaged 18 hr in length, but the range varied from 5 hr to as long as 30 hr. In the second phase the leaves moved in short distinct cycles with an average of 6.6 hr per cycle over an amplitude of 90 degrees. This phase averaged 72 hr in length with a range of 36-103 hr. The third phase showed subtle rhythmic cycles averaging 24 hr per cycle. These cycles were the types normally seen in leaf movement studies but were relatively low in amplitude. Under continuous light the leaf movements persisted uninterrupted over the entire 7-day test period. The major rhythmic cycles averaged 28 hr with the angle ranging up to 90 degrees.

Significant curling is observed within 2 hr after auxin application, and maximal curling with the lateral margins meeting (induced at response-saturating auxin concentrations) occurs about 6 hr after application. This change is readily measured and the response expressed quantitatively in terms of the margin to margin width of the curled leaf relative to the fully extended width of the leaf at its broadest point prior to auxin application. Slight curling can be obtained with auxin concentrations of 10-6 M, and the amount of curling is increased in proportion to the log of the auxin concentration to about 10-3 M. The leaves are most sensitive to auxin at about 7 da:ys after planting (leaf width 28 mm), and by day 9 (leaf Width 43 mm) the primary leaves no longer show a hyponastic response to auxin. Employing buffered solutions (0.1 M phosphate at pH 7), the response appears to be specific for auxins and compounds readily converted into auxins. The relative sensitivity of the bioassay is 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid > indole acetic acid > naphthalene acetic acid > indolebutyric acid\u00bb indolepropionic acid.

Ferulic acid delayed the auxin response but was not otherwise inhibitory, while p-coumaric acid showed no observable effect in the presence or absence of auxin. Triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), which alters normal auxin transport, produced hyponasty followed by epinasty of the primary pinto bean leaf when added to the dorsal surface of the leaf. Addition of TIBA to the ventral surface of the leaf induced only epinasty. In combination with auxin, TIBA can promote the auxin-induced hyponastic response or inhibit this response, depending on whether they are added singly or in combination to either the upper or lower surface. The data indicate that auxininduced hyponasty results from the movement of auxin from the upper to the lower leaf surface where it increases the growth of the cells of the lower surface.

In this study the procedures necessary for somatic hybridization, including the requirements for cellular fusion, proliferative growth of cells, and differentiation into plants, were evaluated with tissue-culture methods. Methods for the initiation and proliferation of monocotyledonous cell cultures (callus) were also intensively studied. Germinating seeds were excellent sources for callus initiation in most dicotyledonous as well as monocotyledonous species tested, with the most consistent response being obtained in the presence of the growth substance, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Kinetin was not essential for the induction or proliferation of callus of the monocotyledonous species studied. Proliferative growth was most consistent in the presence 0' the growth hormone, p-chlorophenoxyacetic acid. Sucrose was equal to or more effective than glucose as a carbon source. Citrate and succinate buffers were utilized in defined media to provide pH control in the pH 4.0-6.0 region, thus permitting control of the degree of ionization of the acidic auxins and basic cytokinins which influence cellular differentiation.

Western Carolina University, Cullowhee-e-S'rtmras CONCERNING THE BIOGENESIS OF C-GLYCOSYLFLAVONEs-Previous research has indicated that C-glycosylation is not a terminal reaction during the synthesis of C-glycosylflavones in the Lemnaceae. C-glycosylation of flavone aglycones did not occur during the biosynthesis of either 6-C-or 8-C-glycosylflavones, nor were 6-C-mono or 8-C-mono-C-glycosylflavones found to be C-glycosylated to 6,8-di-C-glycosylflavones. These data did not indicate when C-glycosylation actually occurred. The hypothesis was presented that the Cglycosylation reaction could have occurred at the chalcone or prechalcone stage of C-glycosylflavone synthesis. Subsequently Spirodela polyrhiza plants have been grown axenically in media containing labeled 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone 2'-glucoside in addition to mineral nutrients and sucrose. Radioautographic studies of the chromatographed methanolic extracts from these plants showed that the chromatographic area representing luteolin 7-O-glucoside contained radioactivity, whereas the areas corresponding to orientin did not. These data indicate that the chalcone aglycone was not a precursor to the C-glycosylflavone in S. polurhiea. Since chalcones have been shown to be precursors to all flavonoids studied, it is hypothesized that if C-glycosylchalcones are precursors to C-glycosylflavones then the C-glycosylation reaction probably occurs prior to the chalcone stage in biosynthesis.",

Carcinogenic aromatic compounds used in this study were: acetamidofluorene (AAFL), aminofluorene (AMFL), and p-dimethylaminoazobenzene (DAB). These chemicals were applied to the apical meristem of the dwarf bean shoot. This was done after the complete emergence of primary leaves and before the development of first trifoliate leaves. After 96 hr of application the total reducing and hydrolyzable sugars in the primary leaves significantly increased. This effect was more pronounced in the case of AAFL and AMFL. The increase in sugar content was correlated with the increase in hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, viz., invertase and amylase. These compounds also increased total soluble proteins and indole-acetic acid content of primary leaves. Additional effects such as various morphogenic responses will be discussed. shastense appear to exist presently at the type locality, whereas the other two species are abundant there and often occur in mixed stands.

Plant species having flowers mechanically adapted to bumblebee form and behavior show vertical distribution patterns correlated with those of Bombue species. Such flowers are infertile in the absence of bumblebees and at higher altitudes may in some cases be infertile even in their presence. Phenologically restricted plants of the alpine tundra exhibit marked forager specificity corresponding to caste development in the annual Bombus colonies. In these circumstances plant species having similar flowerform and/or pollination mechanisms appear to share the same pollinators. At lower elevations the pollinator species spectrum is broader. but still phenologically determined by forager form and abundance. Congeneric plant species exhibiting mutually disjunct vertical distributions are pollinated to a substantial degree by different Bombus species, but pollinator species with wide vertical distributions may effect some degree of ltene flow between them. Hybridization by diurnal vertical foraging migration of pollinators is presently restricted to circumstantial evidence.

Analyses of natural populations by means of Gay's hybrid number method and polygonographs also indicate the close relationship of these taxa.

University of Miami, Coral Gables, Fla.-ROLE OF ORCHID-FLOWER FRAGRANCE IN POLLINATOR SPECIFICITY-Species specific pollination in the sub-tribes Catasetinae and Stanhopeinae of the family Orchidaceae is directly related to the fragrance produced by the orchid flower. Pollinator specificity is the primary barrier to hybridization of species within these sub-tribes. Knowledge of the flower fragrance is therefore essential to understanding the taxonomy of these orchids. Gas chromatographic techniques have shown that where there is a specific pollinator of an orchid species there will also be a distinctive fragrance produced by the flower associated with the specific pollinator. Compounds identified from the flower fragrances are of several types. Field tests in Panama and other South and Central American countries indicate that 1,8-cineole and methyl salicylate are general attractants. Benzyl acetate, d-carvone, linalool, and methyl benzoate appear to be specific attractants. Other compounds such as a-pinene and~-pinene appear to be neutral or repellent. By mixing the co~ pounds identified in the proportions that they occur III the flower fragrance, the specific pollinator can be attracted. alliance, comprises four morphogeographic races which replace each other in shallow winter-wet soils around the borders of the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington and Oregon. There is no morphological or geographical overlap among the races, but the distance between the closest two is only 10 miles. All races are diploid with 2n = 14 chromosomes. Chromatograms representative of the complex revealed 53 different spots. Each race has a characteristic pattern of flavonoid-like components which is distinct from those of the other varieties. It is concluded that Allium douglasii is an assemblage of closely related taxa which replace each other in a linear fashion, possibly in p,hylogenetic sequence, thereby forming a \"Rassenkreis. '",

The significance of these chemical patterns to the evolution of both species is discussed. The other species, M. cinereum, is morphologically heterogeneous but clearly can be divided into three varieties; one of these varieties, however, possesses two distinct morphological entities presumably representing two cytological levels.

The Ohio State University, Columbus-WESTERN LAKE ERIE'S CHANGING AQUATIC AND MARSH FLORA-Floras are continually in a state of flux and any contemporary floristic analysis should take into account those changes in species composition that have occurred through time and the possible factors affecting those changes. The aquatic and marsh flora at the western end of Lake Erie provides an opportunity for this type of study because of the habitat and land-use changes that have been occurring in the marshes, bays, rivers, and ponds since the advent of European man. Furthermore, several previous detailed floristic surveys dating from 1900 onward provide historical data for comparison with information obtained in recent field studies. These comparisons indicate that once common species, such as Typha latifolia, Sagittaria rigida, Phragmites communis, and Zizania aquatica are now rare. Their habitats have become occupied by previously infrequent or rare native species, such as Typha angustifolia, Sagittaria latifolia, Phalaris arundinacea, Calamagrostis canadensis, Hibiscus palusirie, and H. militaris. Submersed aquatics (e.g., Najas jlexilis, Megalodonta beckii, Vallisneria americana, Elodea canadensis, and several species of Potamogeton) which formerly were more abundant are now rare or absent. Naturalized species such as Potamogeton crispus, Butomus umbellatus, Rorippa sylvestris, and Lythrum salicaria are now common in certain portions in the area. More recent invaders presently known to be restricted to a few localities are Epilobium hirsutum, Lycopus asper, L. europoeus, Mentha gentilis, Najas marina, N. minor, Phalaris comariensis, Polygonum orientale, and Ranunculus bulbosus. Possible factors affecting changes in species composition, particularly with reference to the disappearance of the native submersed plants, have been suggested to be (1) carp feeding habits, (2) habitat changes about the margin of the lake, and (3) increased turbidity and silting primarily brought about by land use changes in the lake's western drainage basin. Other possible explanations for the observed floristic shifts bear further investigation.",

The results provide classes of taxa which may help the investigator in his formal taxonomic decisions. But the same set of data used for grouping taxa can also be used to carry out the inverse analysis, the grouping of characters. It is suggested that the results of such a character analysis have great heuristic value for biosystematics and can serve as an efficient context for generating hypotheses of evolutionary importance which can then be strengthened OJ: disproved by regular biosystematic methods. As an illustration, a recent study in the Limnanthaceae will be presented. Although Hitchcock used no tribal designations in the work referred to above, it can be assumed that he considered Triniochloa to be a member of the Agrostideae, since he placed it next to Muhlenbergia. In subsequent publications (in which tribes are indicated) this same arrangement is followed. Other authors have continued this alignment with the exception of Pilger (19.'>4), who assigned Triniochloa to the Stipeae. Recent studies of the type species, T. siipoides, utilizing cytological and anatomical techniques in addition to traditional methods, suggest that the affinities of Triniochloa are with the Meliceae. As in other members of this tribe the leaf sheaths are closed, the ligules are membranous, and the lodicules are truncate and lack vascular traces. The chromosome number of 2n = 32 suggests that this species is a tetraploid with a basic number of x = 8. The chromosomes are small as in other members of the Meliceae, but in the others the basic number is usually x = 9 or x = 10.",

University of South Florida, Tampa--8oME OBSERVATIONS ON THE FLORA OF SOUTHERN FLORIDA--8outhern Florida is an area long recognized as having a unique flora in the continental United States. Although a number of floristic and ecological investigations of this region have been conducted in the past, the area has not received a modern taxonomic account. An investigation is now nearing completion that will result in a manual for use in the description and identification of its plants and plant communities. During the course of this study some statistics have been prepared regarding the floristic composition, including information relative to the tropical and non-tropical elements in the flora, apparent relationships of the flora to that of other phytogeographical divisions, and the principal plant communities and associations. Special attention has also been given to the flora, particularly as it compares with accounts given by previous workers, and to critical groups of plants such as established exotics, endemic species, weed species, and species-complexes. The total flora of approximately 1,500 taxa of vascular plants is largely tropical in origin and the various'communities are remarkably uniform. The apparent limits of the flora . . in southern peninsular Florida are identified. Some of the effects of land development and changes of the local environment on the flora are discussed. Previous studies on microscopic leaf characters have indicated that the cuticular patterns of the lower leaf surface are species-specific in Vaccinium, and that with hybridization the specific patterns break down and result in patterns different from the parental types. Since Vaccinium vacillans and V. tenellum have distinctive leaf shapes, presumed hybrids between them can be recognized by leaf shapes of varying degrees of intermediacy. Variability in 10 variable populations of these two species was studied with respect to cuticular pattern and to leaf morphology. The leaf morphology was evaluated by a graph using leaf-shape characters as coordinates and by a polygonal graph using various leaf characters. Hybrid Index values based on these characters were also used to determine the degree of presumed hybridization of each plant. Trends in variability in leaf-shape characters differed from one population to another; trends established within one population were reversed or nonexistent in other populations. On'y a general correlation between leaf shape and cuticular pattern was established, in that plants of \"hybrid\" cuticular pattern had intermediate leaf shapes. Of the 150 plants of V. vacillans and V. tenellum studied with respect to leaf characteristics, nearly one-third were determined to have leaf characters of varying degrees of intermediacy. Further study and knowledge of the other species in the section Cyanococcus with which V. vacillans and V. tenellum are known to hybridize are necessary before the relationships are better understood and any nomenclatural changes are made in the genus Vaccinium.",

As a result the taxonomy of the tropical species is confused. In the New World tropics there are at least four taxa of the genus. Num-\u00bbhoides ftaccida occurs in a small area in the Colombian llanos and is easily recognized because of its distinctive foliage. It apparently does not reproduce sexually awl this may account for its restricted distribution. The taxon generally called N. humboldtiana is inseparable from white-flowered forms of N. indica of the Old World and the two should be considered conspecific. The yellowflowered Bahaman N. aurea is identical in floral morphology to N. indica; such yellow-flowered populations are sometimes given separate specific status in the Old World. In Mexico and Guatemala there is another yellowflowered species which is either unnamed or is conspecific with a Cuban species whose identity is unknown and is unlikely to be forthcoming in the future. A correct nomen-clature for the neotropical species is impossible without revision of the paleo tropical species. In view of the unlikelihood that such a revision will be forthcoming, and because of the necessity of applying names to the neotropical species, it is suggested that the New World Nymphoides should continue to be called by their traditional, although possibly incorrect, names. The characteristic morphological appearance most people associate with the Umbelliferae is found principally in one of the three subfamilies, Apioideae. In the other two subfamilies, Hydrocotyloideae and Saniculoideae, the presence of \"un-umbelliferous\" morphological appearance is more characteristic. In an attempt to increase our knowledge of the relationship of these three subfamilies seed proteins from selected Umbelliferae were compared using serological and disc electrophoretic methods. Data indicate that the subfamilies can be separated on the basis of protein chemistry and that within the Apioideae a high degree of protein heterogeneity is present.",

This attempt to resolve the question was based on a study of flowers from Cochlospermum, A moreuxia and Bixa from throughout their geographic ranges. Their flowers are usually considered as unspecialized with five free petals alternating with five free sepals, numerous stamens on a broad receptacle, and a two-or three-to five-carpellate pistil. At the base of the receptacle a siphonostele vascularizes the perianth with two flat spirals of five traces each to the calyx and corolla. The stamens are vascularized by five or more trunk bundles which divide into traces in a centrifugal pattern. Controversy over the nature of the septa in the gynoecium in the CocWospermaceae is solved by recognition of their anatomical nature as fused carpellary walls. Analysis of characters reveals numerous differences between Biza and the genera Cochlospermum and Amoreuxia. These include vestiture of the flower, nature of the gynoecium, form of the anthers, and several differences in pollen morphology. These data plus previously reported vegetative morphology support the concept that these families are related but should not be combined into one family.

Michigan State University, East Lansing-CoNsTRUCTION OF IDENTIFICATION KEYS BY COMPUTER-Key construction by computer is superficially similar to numerical taxonomy, but it -differs in that taxa rather than specimens are the fundamental working units, and proper identification rather than classification is the goal. Indeed, the distinguishing features of the taxa must be determined before a key can be constructed. Once this is done, a multitude of keys can usually be produced, of which only a few are acceptably convenient and reliable. The approach is founded on the statistical conclusion that in general the best key to a given group of taxa is the one which approaches equalization of the number of taxa in the two subgroups formed by each dichotomy. However,this method must be modified since other factors are also involved. Weighting of characters is definitely advantageous, as is consideration of how frequently a particular taxon will be encountered by users of the key. The most common taxa should be identified in the fewest steps. Variable taxa offer the choice of lengthening the key by placing them in both subgroups of a dichotomy, or of reducing the overall quality of the key by using a character which is in general less useful. By varying the way these parameters are combined into character-selection criteria, several keys can be obtained from the same data, and the best one for a particular use can then be selected. In the program the data are submitted in three files. First the taxa are listed by name, and a reference number is assigned to each. Next a series of numbered statements is prepared, describing the characters potentially useful as leads in a key. Third, a data table is prepared giving the status of each taxon for each character. For this table a four-symbol code is used, indicating whether a particular characteristic is expressed by all specimens of a taxon, expressed by some, expressed by none, or is not determinable for the taxon. Using whatever character-selection criterion the taxonomist specifies, the computer constructs the best key possible from the data given. The output of this program is a set of numeric records from which a conventional key is generated and printed by a second program, which can also be used independently for revising and editing previously prepared keys. Output is in either the indented or the bracketed style, and as many copies as desired can be produced.",

University of Illinois, Chicago Circle-THE EFFECT OF COROLLA COLOR AND OUTLINE ON INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN FLOW IN Par.ox-c-Interspecifie pollen flow in Phlox was measured from P. glaberrima toa series of P. drummondii cultivars which varied in corolla color and outline. The size of the pollen of these species differs conspicuously and therefore a stigma inspection readily reveals the number of alien grains. Pollen from P. glaberrima, whose corolla is red-pink, was transported most often to the pink, lavender and magenta phases of P. drummondii, and infrequently to the red and white phases. Pollen from P. glaberrima, whose corolla lobes are entire, was carried primarily to the entire-lobe form of P. drummondii as opposed to the laciniate-lobe form. These facts indicate that Phlox pollinators, primarily butterflies, can discriIninate strongly between certain groups of colors and not others, and between conspicuous differences in corolla outline. Thus differences in color and outline may play a major role in ethological isolation.",

IN THE LEMNAcEAE----'Eighty-eight collections of the Lemnaceae, including species belonging to the genera Spirodela (foul' species), Lemma (seven species), Wolffia (three species) and Wolffiella (three species), were examined by gel acrylamide disc electrophoresis for their glutamate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and beta-esterase zyrnograms (i.e., isoenzyme patterns among these enzyme systems). These data were assembled from organisms grown axenically under uniform cultural conditions. The zymograms were found to consist of major and minor isoenzyme bands; the former being relatively consistent among the various clones of anyone taxon; the latter were often variable but nonetheless diagnostic. Nearl;y all of the isoenzyme systems showed polymorphism WIthin the various species, except for glutamate dehydrogenase. This enzyme was nearly always present as a single band, but the Rp of the enzyme varied among the taxon from a low of 16 to a high of 32. Systematic implications of these data were mostly confined to the recognition of specific isoenzyme pattern for a given taxon; that is, each of the species could be recognized by the various zymograms in combination. In a few cases these data suggested that some redisposition of certain species among the genera might be made. Thus, the GDH, MDH and LDH zymograms suggested that Spirodela oligorhiza was related to Lemma through the species L. gibba and L. obscura. It was concluded that while isoenzyme information of this type might prove useful at the specific level, especially for purposes of identification and/or populational study, it was unlikely to prove useful in the evaluation of relationships above the generic level.

The resultant ears compared favorably with those resulting from late morning and early afternoon pollinations. Evening pollinations provided an opportunity to perpetuate inbred lines and build hybrids, when other duties or commitments interfered between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, the usual hours for controlled hand-pollination. Less possibility of contamination by unwanted pollen was an added advantage of working at this time. Carriers of Ii 0, Iw., and lW2 genes for chlorophyll deficiency in Zea are examples of lines that were selfed during these hours with good results. Also at this time of day crosses were made that were necessary to build lines which carried two and three different genes for \"albinism\" in Zea. The multiple lines (plants which carry two or more different genes for chlorophyll deficiency) exhibited heterosis and when selfed in the evening likewise produced wellfilled average to large ears.

The various media are used to increase a lecturer's effectiveness rather than offer a substitute for professional excellence. Human beings can learn while being entertained if the entertainment vehieles encourage emotional, personal involvement with the material being presented and do not distract or otherwise interfere. As non-science majors often seem hostile towards science curricula, an effort is made to utilize all available means for presenting General Botany in such an exciting and relevant manner that almost anyone could become interested in plants. This type of presentation is most satisfactory with student audiences of 100-1000 in auditoria equipped with modern light and sound equipment, and it is in part an attempt to overcome the empty magnification phenomenon which accompanies many poorly attended general background courses in large universities.

It was found that unvernalized (not treated with low temperature) shoot apices of wheat plants remained in the vegetative stage and never flowered under the condition of short-day photoperiod (8 hr). However, the vernalized (low-temperature-treated) shoot apices of wheat plants grown under the long-day photoperiod (16 hr or longer) passed from the vegetative into the reproductive stage and produced flowers throughout the life of the plant. The methods and techniques used during this experiment were relatively simple and can be adapted easily for a laboratory exercise in any introductory botany course. Throughout the semester students should make their own observations of the apices of wheat plants grown under these various environmental conditions. They can gain experience in observing morphogenetic changes and recording them, particularly those related to floral initiation and differentiation.

The pollen record allows a more certain check of the wind-pollinated plants of a region at a particular time than may be obtained bv studying only the macrofossils. Because the Inyan Kara Group of South Dakota is the source of an important Lower Cretaceous flora (Ward et al., 1899), a palynologic investigation of it was undertaken, The older formation of the group, the Lakota, is characterized by a lack of tricolpate pollen (angiosperm). The wind-pollinated vegetation of Lakota time was dominated by conifers, including numbers of the Araucarlaeeae, Podocarpaceae and Pinaceae: ferns were abundant and diverse.

Harvard University, Cambridge, MasS.--SPORANGIAL FRAGMENTS IN TRIASSIC CHERT FROM SARAwAK-Numerous sporangial fragments are organically preserved in primary chalcedonic chert from the Upper Triassic (Carnian/Norian) of Sarawak, North Borneo Region, Malaysia. Based on the better preserved and most complete capsules, two more or less distinct groups of sporangia are morphologically distinguished. One group, consisting of small sporangia (ca. 0.3 mm in diam) , exhibits complete, uninterrupted annuli with no,' or only slight, stomial differentiation. These are comparable in diameter to the smaller sporangial sizes reported for certain Rhaetic Dipteridaceous ferns. The other group, consisting of much larger sporangia (ca. 0.6 mm in diam) , exhibits annuli with an evident zone of primitive stomial differentiation. This annular type has a. bow region composed of approximately 20 highly indurated cells. Apparently representing an early form of stomium are three or four cells which lack the induration characteristic of advanced stomial lip cells. On either side of the stomium, three and two (or three) transitional cells form hardly differentiated hypostomial and epistomial zones respectively. The attachment of the stalk to the apparently lenticular capsule has not been observed, but evidence suggests an oblique annulus uninterrupted by the attachment of stalk tissue. Comparison of size and annular features with the sporangia of fossil forms reported from the early Mesozoic suggests affinity with the Keuper-Rhaetic Dipteridaceous complex, especially with Dictyophyllum exile (Brauns) Nath, and Camptopteris spiralis N ath. 10:.55 Hall, J.

Subsequent.ly, crosses have been made between var. squamulosu8 and var. tigrinus followed by 100 backcrosses, replicated four times, to the recessive parent,var. squamulosus.

The morphology and behavior of mature RS thalli were observed using Zeiss Normarski phase-interference microscopy. The results suggest that mature resistant sporangia grown under any of the above conditions all exhibit a similar type of pitted-wall sculpture. Under suitable conditions RS from all of the above will germinate, cleave out zoospores, produce exit tubes, and release zoospores.
