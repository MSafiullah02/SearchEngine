However, clinical FIP has been reported more commonly in purebred cats elsewhere, and Benetka et al (2004) has suggested that some purebred cats might have strong genetic predisposition to develop disease. Our small study suggested widespread FCoV infection in both pedigree and domestic cats, and showed a wide age range to be affected. Clinical FIP has previously been documented to be more common in cats less than 1 year of age (Addie and Jarrett 1992), and consistent with this observation, we found a higher rate of FCoV infection in younger cats (71% in cats 6\u201312 months) than older cats (47% in cats over 1 year).",

Vennema et al (1998) have also reported that FIPV, unlike FECV, is generally not transmitted horizontally from cat to cat (FIPV variants arising de novo within a cat already infected with FECV). The use of RT-PCR assay has been suggested by several researchers (Benetka et al., 2004, Campolo et al., 2005) as a suitable technique for detecting FCoV carrier cats at early periods of infection. However, viraemia has been shown to occur not only in cats with FIP, but also in healthy carriers (Herrewegh et al., 1995, Gunn-Moore et al., 1998), and there are presently no diagnostic assays that distinguish virulent and avirulent FCoV variants. Nevertheless, using the same methods we employed in this study (an identical RT-PCR detecting mRNA for the highly conserved M gene), Simons et al (2005) reported that the detection of FCoV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a high specificity for the clinical diagnosis of FIP with a very low proportion of healthy cats (or cats with non-FIP disease) testing positive with this assay.",

            "text": "In contrast to the results obtained by Simons et al (2005) we found that 14 of 26 (54%) blood samples from cats were positive for FCoV mRNA, and only one of these cats had clinical disease that was consistent with a diagnosis of FIP. Although long-term monitoring of the outdoor cats in this study could not be performed, we are aware that three of the 13 PCR-positive healthy cats (the three that were housed together in a single house) remained healthy for at least 6 months. These three cats, which were 6, 7 and 13 years old, had previously lived with another cat which had developed FIP-like clinical signs and had died 1 month before this study was undertaken. Overall, we found positive PCR results in 13 of 25 healthy cats (52%), whereas Simons et al (2005) reported positive results in only 5% of healthy cats (and 93% of cats with confirmed FIP). Our detection rate was also higher than that reported by others (Herrewegh et al., 1995, Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) who used different RT-PCR technique for detection of FCoVs in blood from healthy cats. We do not know exactly why our results are so different to those of Simons et al (2005), but they raise important questions over the specificity of this assay in diagnosing clinical FIP. The sequencing of FCoV isolates detected in this study has not yet been completed, but such results may help to clarify whether the positive results relate to infection with FECV or FIPV biotypes. However, the lifestyle of these cats (mainly outdoors, but living in groups and sharing food and toileting areas) would certainly predispose to a high rate of FECV transmission (Kass and Dent, 1995, Pedersen, 1995, Addie et al., 1996), and this may explain the high number of PCR-positive samples.",
