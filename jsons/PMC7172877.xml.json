New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia encompasses an adult and pediatric academic quaternary medical center, in addition to community sites in upper Manhattan and Westchester, with a collective annual volume of approximately 250,000 visits. For the month of March, we have seen approximately 850 cases of COVID-19 with the majority arriving from March-15th-30thz. Faced with rapid acceleration of volume and acuity, broad challenges have included: optimization of physical space and staffing, the development of management strategies for high numbers of patients requiring respiratory support, minimizing transmission risk to other patients and healthcare staff, determining best strategies for redeployed non-emergency medicine physicians and staff, and finally, frontline staff fatigue and well-being.",

With the support of institutional leadership we orchestrated a multi-departmental response to the crisis. To accommodate the anticipated ED volume and acuity, flexible approaches to staffing from within and outside our ED were implemented. Due to low pediatric volumes and cancellation of elective procedures/surgeries, we harnessed an influx of available critical care beds, physicians, and support staff. We designated an incident commander to help lead efforts and support clinical staff 24 hours per day. In collaboration with the hospitalist service, transfers of care (e.g. \u201csign out\u201d) to admitting teams were done in the ED, with redeployed off-service clinicians managing admitted patients to allow emergency clinicians to treat new patients. In collaboration with ambulatory care providers, \u201ccough and cold\u201d clinics were established outside of the ED to rapidly evaluate low acuity patients with viral symptoms, helping to reduce ED volumes. In addition, they performed a medical screening exam, facilitating transfer to specialty clinics for isolated low acuity complaints (e.g. orthopedics, gynecology). Finally, patient bedding was adjusted to reduce transmission risk, with suspected COVID-19 patients placed into isolation rooms and positive cases cohorted together.",

Additionally, a COVID-19 \u201cSWAT\u201d team consisting of surgical chief residents and attendings was organized and available to perform procedures such as central lines and arterial lines. Given the increased need for difficult goals of care conversations, we involved palliative care, social services, and ethics consultations early and often for critically ill patients, including pre-intubation.",
