            "text": "Answer: Current evidence is limited to a small number of studies with small numbers of patients. Prior to scanning, ensure that your machine is set to a lung preset. If your ultrasound machine does not have a lung preset, use the abdominal or cardiac preset with tissue harmonic imaging and multi-beam (MB) settings turned off. By turning off these settings, ultrasound artefacts, which are the basis of lung ultrasound, will become more prominent. Patients with COVID-19 commonly have lung ultrasound findings: B lines with variable appearance (including focal, multifocal, and confluent), subpleural consolidations ( Figure 1 ), pleural thickening or irregularity, and larger consolidations with occasional air bronchograms. A multi-lobar distribution of abnormalities is common. Ultrasound B lines correspond to the typical ground glass opacities visualized on CT imaging. Pleural effusions, other than small localized effusions, are rare. Abnormalities are most commonly visualized in the posterior and inferior lung fields. [1] [2] [3] In the early stages of infection, the main ultrasound finding is focal B lines. As the disease progresses, B lines can become multifocal and confluent, with further development into frank consolidations. 1-3 Early lung ultrasound findings of B lines and subpleural consolidation can be seen here: https://youtu.be/fO3fFsZQjUg. COVID-19 patients may also develop severe cardiac complications, including heart failure, myocarditis, and cardiogenic shock. Point-of-care echocardiography may demonstrate ventricular dilatation or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. 4 ",
