N protein is composed of three distinct and highly conserved domains: two structural and independently folded regions, N terminal domain (NTD, \u223c180 amino acids) and C-terminal domain (CTD, \u223c160 amino acids), that are separated by an intrinsically disordered region (LKR, \u223c70 amino acids).

Caspar and Klug extended this idea by introducing the principle of quasiequivalence 10 , that allows larger viruses to form, requiring even smaller relative portions of their genomic sequences to code for their capsids. Recently, Twaroc and Luque showed that this theory is a special case of an overarching design principle for icosahedral, as well as octahedral, architectures that can be formulated in terms of the Archimedean lattices and their duals 11 . The basic symmetry rules imply a general principle whenever a structure of a definitive size and shape has to be built up from smaller subunits 12 , the packing arrangements have to be repeated and hence the subunits are likely to be related by symmetry operations 9 . Spherical viruses must be contained in one of the three possible cubic point groups: tetrahedron, cube/octahedron, dodecahedron/icosahedron.",

Structural proteins must hence combine in modules that obey certain types of geometries and exist as monomers, dimers, trimers, etc 14 . There are limited possibilities to build structures that are close to spherical and that optimize resilience. These can be algebraically constructed and can be expressed as three-dimensional shapes with sets of regular polyhedra, its truncations, duals and geodesics. These polyhedra have three algebraic origins: the icosahedral, octahedral and tetrahedral, and its capacities to tessellate the bi and tri-dimensional space. As far as our current understanding goes, most of the viruses adopt an efficient strategy, that of the icosahedron, that can get close to sphericity with its 20 facets 15 . Examples of even more efficient forms include the icosidodecahedron (32 facets), and its dual, the rhombic triacontahedron (30 facets). The octahedral and the hexahedral geometries are algebraically bonded and are capable of generating a set of polyhedra by truncation and geodesic iteration that occupy the volume very close to a sphere. Given their algebraic origin, these are tillable by self-similar building blocks and can be modulated 16 . An overview of the model we propose is presented in Figure 1 . There is a fundamental characteristic that gives the octahedral geometry a preference for CoVs RNP structure. This geometry allows the polyhedra to be constructed with a continuous linear coil winding, that is to say one linear element composed of identical modules that, in the case of RNP, is a large tubular helicoid that preserves the long, continuous, RNA chain. The truncated vertex of the octahedron is bidimensionally tillable in a linear and periodic manner. On the contrary, the pentagonal truncated vertex of the icosahedron is only tillable by non linear, aperiodic structures and thus cannot be built with a linear, modulated, coil winding. Accordingly, CTD can conform helices that have akin geometry to the octahedron, constructing threads that can turn at 135 \u2022 preserving the helical constitution.",

These linear orderings are modulated in segments of \u223c8nm for each CTD octamer and 4nm for the tetramers (Fig. 3a) . The hexagonal facet is composed of 6x4 and the square facet by 4x4 modules (Fig. 1 ). There are 8 hexagons composed of 74 CTD tetramers and 6 squares composed of 16 CTD tetramers. The winding of the helicoid is completed with 2752 CTD, with a linear extension of RNP of \u223c11000nm, coincident with the expected size for packing the complete CoV genome. The helicoidal assemblies that form the winding of the helices conform with the structure of the NTD outer shell in the form of a truncated octahedron, such that they contain n-1 triangular modules in each level of the hexagonal facets as they approach the vertices (Fig. 4) . The packing is such that the tubular arrangements of 10nm stack 2.5nm, leaving 5nm for each level.",

Taking into account that the space in between the external facets of both polyhedra is 7nm, the interstitial space is about 3nm. NTD have 2nm protuberances to the inside that pack precisely against the tubular levels of CTD (Fig. 4) . Since both NTD and CTD are connected by the LKR region, and both globular domains have been shown to interact with RNA 1 , we speculate that the interstitial space is filled with the LKR and RNA that is winded along the CTD helix. Cryo electron tomography showed that the coronavirus nucleocapsid is separated from the envelope by a gap, which has revealed to contain thread-like densities that connect the protein density on the inner face of the viral membrane to a two-dimensionally ordered ribonucleoprotein layer 5 . Focal pairs revealed the existence of an extra internal layer that was attributed to the M protein, but that is compatible with the composite model we propose. Moreover, nucleoprotein densities were observed as a paracrystalline RNP shell, and may be partially organized at points of contact of the RNP lattice. The distribution of density in the viral core was consistent with a membrane-proximal RNP lattice formed by local approaches of the coiled ribonucleoprotein 5, 17 . In the interior of the particles, coiled structures and tubular shapes were observed, consistent with a helical CTD model. The ribonucleoprotein appears to be extensively folded onto itself, assuming a compact structure that tends to closely follow the envelope at a distance of 4 nm 5 . This indicates the existence of an additional layer that would confer the virion envelope its remarkable thickness.",

            "text": "Viral nucleocapsids must obey a structural strategy that efficiently packs a long continuous chain of nucleic acid in an ordered manner, and thus it needs to adopt a consistent morphology. At the same time it is biologically required to have the versatility to disassemble and reassemble the components, in this case a tubular helicoidal packing of RNA and protein. We propose that these cannot be arbitrarily packed inside the virion but must be modulated, implying structural forms that are robustly built. The model we present is compatible with the known high resolution structures of the basic elements of N protein, their stoichiometry, and the lattice densities observed by cryoEM and cryo electron tomography. The octahedral geometry was previously observed in the bacteriophage MS2 (pdb 2VTU 19 ), a smaller nucleocapsid with no membrane. However, many EM studies did not observe a clear octahedral nucleocapsid as we propose, but rather describe roughly spherical pleomorphic particles. We propose that these observations can be reinterpreted under the current model. The apparent pleomorphism of CoVs may not be caused by RNP, but the transformations of the membrane that surrounds the nucleocapsid. If the capsid is octahedral, the membrane may flatten in the facets, giving the impression of strong deformations (Fig. 5 ).",
