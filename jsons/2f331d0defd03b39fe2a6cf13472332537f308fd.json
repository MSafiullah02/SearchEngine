A large number of lymphoid nodules were present in the pyloric gland region. There were many silver-positive, Gram-negative, spiral-shaped organisms in the lumen of the gastric glands and they were mainly present in the upper half of the gastric mucosa. Many were attached to the epithelial cells of the gastric glands and some were found in groups and large clusters on the surface of the gastric mucosa, in the gastric pits, or deep in the glandular lumina. Numerous neutrophils had infiltrated into the lumen of the gastric gland, the gastric pits and the lamina propria. There was a correlation between the number of organisms observed and the degree of gastric inflammation. The lesions of the proximal small intestine, especially the jejunum, showed advanced degeneration and desquamation or shedding of the villous epithelial cells ( Figure 2 ). Also identified were oedema and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages in the lamina propria and decrease of lymphocytes in the lymphatic follicles. The spiral-shaped organisms were also present in the intestinal mucosal surface, adhering to the degenerative epithelium. In the other organs, there were decreased lymphocytes and atrophy of lymphatic follicles in the spleen, lymph nodes and thymus.",

Three morphologic forms of these organisms in dogs have been reported. 4 All three are now known to be Helicobacter on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence analysis. 2 The organism in this study could not be strictly classified according to Lockard typing methods based on morphologic criteria, including the length, width, coils, periplasmic fibers and sheathed flagella. They were stained by polyclonal antisera against H pylori, and the location of these organisms was similar to H pylori of humans, therefore, they seem to be one of the pathogenic Helicobacter species. However, we could not check the specificity of the polyclonal antisera with all other morphologically similar bacteria such as Arcobacter spp and Campylobacter spp. Therefore, the term Helicobacter-like organisms is appropriate in this study. In unweaned beef calves H pylori was not visualised or cultured from any of the abomasal tissue samples. 5 On the other hand, one report indicates the presence of serum antibodies in 6 of 22 calves, which reacted with epitopes from H pylori. 6 Moreover, spiral-shaped bacteria, including H pylori, may be found frequently in the bovine abomasum. 3 However, the relationship between those organisms and gastrointestinal lesions in ruminants is still unclear. Our results indicate that the inflammatory lesions and erosions found in the gastrointestinal tracts in the reindeer were associated with Helicobacter-like organisms.",

Helicobacter-like organisms and rotavirus were present in the small intestinal lesions at the same time. Rotavirus infection can result in high mortality and this usually is attributed to mixed infection with such agents as coronavirus, adenovirus and toxigenic Escherichia coli. 11 The small intestinal lesions seemed to be caused mainly by rotavirus in the present case, 1 perhaps associated with Helicobacter-like organisms. Some Helicobacter species (for example, H cinaedi and H fennelliae) have been linked to proctitis and colitis in immunocompromised humans, 12 and furthermore, two cases of human enteritis associated with H pullorum have been reported. 13 Taken in the light of recent reports, our findings indicate that Helicobacter and rotavirus infection occurred in the gastrointestinal tract of a reindeer at the same time. The findings further suggest that Helicobacter-like organisms may play a role in the enteritis associated with rotaviral infection in reindeer. ",
