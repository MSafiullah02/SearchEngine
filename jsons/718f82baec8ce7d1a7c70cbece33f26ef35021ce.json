Our approach recognises the fact that testing capacities are severely constrained in many countries. In this setting, we show that finding the best way to utilise this limited number of tests during a pandemic can be formulated concisely as an allocation problem. Our problem formulation takes into account the heterogeneity of the population and uses pooled testing to identify and isolate individuals while prioritising key workers and individuals with a higher risk of spreading the disease. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of our testing and containment mechanism, we perform simulations using a network-based SIR model. Our simulations indicate that applying our mechanism on a population of 100, 000 individuals with only 16 tests per day reduces the peak number of infected individuals by approximately 20%, when compared to the scenario where no intervention is implemented.",

Testing can be used to identify infected individuals in order to give them appropriate treatment, to trace a chain of transmissions, to estimate the infection rate in the population, and to limit the spread by removing infected individuals from the population through self-isolation. However, the number of tests available is often much less than what would be required to test and isolate all suspected cases. In this resource constrained scenario, tests must to be allocated efficiently in order to have maximum impact on public health. A number of methods to reduce the number of tests required have been discussed, using group testing [Gollier and Gossner, 2020] and focusing testing on health care workers [Matthew Cleevely et al., 2020 . The underlying idea behind both of these approaches is that efficient testing and isolation strategies can be a way to reduce the economic consequences of the pandemic, by allowing individuals who test negative to rejoin the workforce. We propose a more general approach, combining both group testing and segmented testing, as a way of containing the disease while allowing for some economic activity. By considering a reduction in the transmission of the virus to be the principal goal of testing, we formulate an optimisation algorithm that finds the best allocation with a limited testing budget to achieve this goal.",

Instead of simply testing those that happen to first become ill with severe symptoms, we argue that these tests can be used more efficiently. First of all, group testing is more beneficial than individual testing, as it misses fewer infected individuals. Second of all, certain segments of the population, those with many social interactions such as grocers and nurses, are at high risk of transmitting the virus to others should they become infected and should therefore be prioritised for testing. However, since nurses are needed in health care the social cost of their self-isolation if they are not infected is high, so they should be tested in smaller groups compared to other professions. This is a strategic and systematic way to approach the problem, and would greatly reduce the transmission rate compared to randomly testing individuals. Our method works well even for recurring waves of the disease, which has been modelled in the literature [Ferguson et al., 2020] , and does not require long-lasting immunity in order to be feasible. It is also possible to include the sensitivity of the test itself as part of the optimisation problem. While we have primarily focused on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to its urgent nature, our approach is generally applicable and can also be used for other infectious diseases.",

Our simulations do not include implementing any other interventions, such as isolating symptomatic cases, which would further increase the reach of a limited number of tests by mainly testing asymptomatic individuals.",

In reality, tests have a false positive and false negative rate which need to be taken into account when deciding whether individuals self-isolate or not as a result of test results. To model this scenario within our resource-constrained optimisation framework, we can assume that a given group of g individuals is given a test of \"intensity\" s, and as a function of the intensity, the test has a false positive rate of p + (s) and a false negative rate of p \u2212 (s). Intensity can for example represent making s independent tests on the same group, and taking the majority vote of the results as the final group test result. In this setting, we can consider an identical containment policy to what we've outlined in Section 2.3, but refine the relevant costs with more nuanced false positive and false negative rates. With this in hand, we obtain a similar optimisation program where each segment of the population, C i is tested at granularity g i , scope",

This approach cannot be immediately used if the groups themselves are randomly selected. Especially if the probability that an individual is infected is small, for a group to test positive there would need to be an infected individual inside it that is also randomly selected, drastically changing the result from proper group testing. This may or may not be desirable, as although different, random group testing can (on a large scale) reflect more accurately the situation within groups: the probability that a random group (of any size) testing positive is exactly p i . However, pseudo-group testing might be appropriate for groups which are highly correlated and a randomly selected individual is most likely a good representative of the group.",
