            "text": "An outbreak of a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause that began in Wuhan, China has continued since December 2019. This illness is reported to have affected more than 79 602 people so far (74 680 confirmed, 4922 suspected, 16 646 cured, and 2122 deaths). In addition to Hubei, Wanzhou, Chongqing ranks third in infection rates among all of the cities in the provinces of China. A literature review was performed, and it was found that there have been no studies regarding the characteristics of patients infected with COVID\u201019 in Chongqing. Clinically, the disease is characterized by fever, dyspnea, dry cough, and fatigue. Upper\u2010respiratory tract symptoms are not prominent, but diarrhea was reported by some patients. Pulmonary imaging has shown multiple ground glass and infiltrative shadows in both lungs. Severe cases have been shown to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. On 7 January 2019, scientists successfully isolated the pathogen that causes the pneumonia, a new type of \u03b2\u2010coronavirus, and it was named 2019\u2010nCoV.\n1\n Subsequently, WHO named it coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019). An epidemiological survey showed that the first occurrence of COVID\u201019 patients was closely related to a seafood market in south China. Due to the \u201cSpring Festival Movement\u201d (known as the \u201cannual migration of the population in China\u201d), COVID\u201019 rapidly spread throughout the country, and the number of infected people gradually increased. The spread of COVID\u201019 among people has been confirmed to occur through multiple channels, such as droplets, aerosols, feces, and mouth mucus membranes.\n1\n\n",

A total of 135 patients were enrolled in this study. Oral consent was obtained from all of the patients.

This facility is responsible for the treatment of COVID\u201019 patients as assigned by the government. All of the patients with COVID\u201019 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance\n2\n and were jointly diagnosed by a multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment team composed of infectious disease experts, respiratory medicine staff, critical care medical staff, and emergency medicine staff.

General information included epidemiological histories, current medical histories, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory examination results, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations, treatment measures, complications, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and other parameters. The patients were divided into mild (including normal and mild) and severe (including severe and critical) groups. The mild group had mild clinical symptoms and no pneumonia on imaging. The normal group had symptoms of fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging showed pneumonia. The severe group had respiratory distress, RR \u2265 30 beats/minute in a resting state, a mean oxygen saturation of \u226493%, and an arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) \u2264 300 mm Hg.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of male and female patients, and infection in children was rare, which was inconsistent with the results of a study performed by Zhong et al.\n6\n Their results showed that males were more likely to be infected than females.\n6\n A total of 83.7% of the patients included in this study had contact history in Wuhan, had been to Wuhan, or had contact with people from Wuhan, which again verified the conclusion of human to human transmission.\n7\n The primary symptoms were fever and cough, which agreed with the research results of Zhao et al.\n8\n, \n9\n Other symptoms included myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, and anorexia. COVID\u201019 patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhea), whereas about 20% to 25% of patients infected with MERS\u2010CoV or SARS\u2010CoV experienced diarrhea.\n10\n The primary complications during hospitalization included ARDS, arrhythmia, and shock. Patchy shadows of the bilateral lungs and ground\u2010glass shadow were typical CT signs of COVID\u201019. The most severe patients were older and had more basic diseases compared to mild patients.",

The imaging of pulmonary changes due to COVID\u201019, like most viral pneumonias, was pleomorphic with interstitial changes and patchy and ground glass shadows.\n11\n The imaging of pulmonary changes was often out of step with the patient's symptoms and nucleic acid test results. The expert group from our hospital called this phenomenon the \u201cshadow\u2010syndrome discrepancy.\u201d Some mild patients often had no fever, cough, dyspnea, and other symptoms. In contrast, the symptoms were mild, and multiple nucleic acid tests were negative, but the CT showed a large ground glass area in the lung. Therefore, some clinicians have suggested that a CT examination should be the first choice in the screening and diagnosis of COVID\u201019, and it has been suggested that patients should have a chest CT scan every 3 to 5 days to understand the changes in the lung lesions to more accurately evaluate the condition.",

In most patients, the leukocyte count was in the normal range and lymphocyte count was generally reduced, which agreed with the recent research results published by academician Zhong et al.\n6\n This suggests that the virus may cause disease by attacking the immune system. LDH and aspartate aminotransferase generally increased, but the albumin of patients decreased.

Lymphocytopenia may be related to a cytokine storm caused by viral invasion.

At present, the primary measures to control this disease are early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatment for affected patients. In this study, all of the patients were treated with oxygen therapy and antiviral drugs. In addition, many patients received antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]) and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]), and a few patients required invasive ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. According to a recent Korean scholar's report,\n14\n, \n15\n Kaletra was shown to be effective in the early treatment of COVID\u201019 patients, and the earlier Kaletra was used, the more significant the therapeutic effect. Their experience primarily came from the treatment of the MERS coronavirus in 2015, and they had established guidelines. Initially, only the severe patients were treated with Kaletra, and mild patients were not administered the drug in Wuhan, leading to a low patient cure rate. These results indicated that the application effect of Kaletra was not significant in severe patients. All of the patients in our hospital were treated with Kaletra in the early stage, with the belief that Kaletra may play a role in the inhibition of viral replication. Currently, there are 236 patients in our hospital, and 98 of them have been cured and discharged, for a cure rate of 41.5%. The therapeutic effect is obvious. Japan has also announced that they will conduct clinical trials using Kaletra on patients with COVID\u201019.",
