With this growing crisis, companies & researchers over the world are looking for the ways to address the challenges of this virus, to mitigate the spread and develop a cure for this disease. In this baffling battle, science and technology is playing a vital role. For example, early in the outbreak when China initiated its response to virus it focused on artificial intelligence (AI) by relying on like facial recognition cameras to track the infected patients with travel history, robots to deliver food and medicines, drones to disinfect public places, to patrol and broadcast audio messages to public encouraging them to stay at home [1]. AI has been used extensively to discover new molecules on the way to find aid for COVID-19. Many researchers are using AI to find new drugs and medicines for the cure, along with some computer science researchers focusing on detecting the infectious patients through medical image processing like X-rays and CT scans [2]. AI is even developing tracking software's like monitoring bracelets that helps in classification of peoples breaching the quarantine rule. Smart phones and AI enhanced thermal cameras are also being used for detecting fever and infected people [3]. Countries like Taiwan infused the national medical insurance database with inputs from the immigration and customs database, hence confronting the coronavirus patients on the basis of their travel history and symptoms [4,5].",

Scientists working on AI applications show that it can give extra time to radiologists and do a diagnosis quicker and less expensive than with coronavirus regular tests. For this purpose, the doctors can use X-rays as well as CT scans, Computed Tomography [9]. Table 2\nexplains different artificial intelligence applications in CT diagnosis of COVID-19. Coronavirus tests are short in supply and costly, however, all emergency clinics have X-Rays (or CT) machines. With the assistance of Deep Learning, radiologists can diagnose COVID-19 using X-ray pictures. COVID-Net an artificial intelligence application is created to analyze COVID-19 symptoms in chest x-rays utilizing information of different lung conditions and COVID-19 from patients [10]. In a diagnostic study, an AI platform was established using inception migration neural network for extracting COVID-19 symptoms using CT images, achieving 89.5% accuracy [11]. An initial detection model was created to recognize COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and sound cases with pulmonary CT pictures utilizing deep learning systems. The patient's infected parts were proportioned by using a 3-D deep learning model. This study showed 86.7% accuracy of the model [12,13]. Jin et al. developed a deep learning model that can precisely identify corona virus symptoms from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. A 3D deep learning framework using chest CT was constructed using a neural network (COV-Net) [14]. For Coronavirus diagnosis; a deep learning model was proposed which straightforwardly accepts CT scans information as input and implements lung division, diagnose COVID-19 and finds abnormal slices. Furthermore, the study trusts that the diagnosis outcomes of AI framework can be quantitatively clarified in the initial picture to mitigate the disadvantage of deep neural systems as a black box [15]. An automated tool was created to quantifying the symptoms of this virus in the lungs of the patient and to observe the growth of the infection or reaction to cure, using a deep learning method. The capability of AI in diagnostics isn't yet practiced, though Chinese hospitals have installed ''AI-assisted\" radiology technology. Reverse. Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the key methodology used for diagnosing coronavirus, yet they have restrictions as far as specimen assortment, time required for the study, and execution [16]. Specific abnormality in images and designs in CT scans showing COVID-19 symptoms has been discovered [17].",

Different proposition have been made to use cell phones in COVID-19 identification, either utilizing implanted sensors to recognize COVID-19 side effects or phone based surveys to channel high-risk patients dependent on reactions to key questions [20]. Berlin utilizes an epidemiological SIR model that considers containment measures by governments, for example, lockdowns, quarantines, and social distancing solutions [21].

In lieu of this, a forecast model dependent on the XGBoost calculation was made to predict mortality risk and distinguish key features which can be estimated in clinics. The researchers found out three key clinical pointers (lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocyte and high-affectability C-receptive protein) for assessing a patient's mortality. A plus point of this method is its interpretability, the three indicators identified by the methodology correspond to the most significant factors in the pathophysiological progress of COVID-19, specifically cell injury, cell immunity, and inflammation [28]. A corresponding report meant to forecast if existing COVID-19 patients would require a long stay in hospitals or not, based on a U-Net subsidiary trained on CT imaging data [29]. These two methodologies can help in recognizing the patients that may require escalated and long-term care, helping clinics deal more adequately. At last, while both of these investigations were constrained in scope and information, they establish significant roads of research that can be supplemented and stretched out with clinical information from approaching cases the world over.",

These RNA-replicating proteins, called \"polymerases,\" make a target for treatments [32]. Proteins have a 3D structure, which is evaluated by their genetically encoded amino acid sequence, and this structure impacts the role and purpose of the protein [33]. There are two primary ways to deal with the forecast task: template modeling, which predicts structure utilizing similar proteins as a template sequence, and the other is template free modeling, which predicts structure for proteins that have unknown related structure [34]. The AlphaFold model depends on an enlarged ResNet architecture and uses amino acid sequences, and also features taken out from parallel amino acid sequences using several sequence arrangements, to foresee the distance and the dispersal of angles between amino acid residues [35]. This framework has been applied to anticipate the structures of six proteins identified with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein, protein 3a, Nsp2, Nsp4, Nsp6, and papain-like proteinase) [33]. It is projected that these predictions will help to see coronavirus capacities and possibly lead to future improvement of cures against COVID-19.",

Coronaviruses cause sickness by binding the body's ACE2 receptors. The MIT specialists are utilizing an AI model trained on data about the ACE2 receptor to simulate the connection between the baits and the virus [36]. Some research focuses to find novel compounds for use in focusing on SARS-Cov2 by utilizing an exclusive pipeline to discover inhibitors for the 3C-like protease [37]. Such models utilize three sorts of information: the crystal structure of the protein, the co-crystalized ligands, and the homology model of the protein. For each info type, various models including Generative Auto-encoders and Generative Adversarial Networks are utilized [38]. The researchers investigate potential applicants using a reinforcement learning approach with a prize capacity that consolidates factors, for example, measures of medication, likeness, novelty, and assorted variety.",

WHO's reaction to fighting this infodemic is using its Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) stage for imparting data to key partners [39]. Apart from that, the Facebook promotions with content identified with the infection is analyzed. The Facebook Ad Library [40] scans all commercials utilizing the catchphrases \"coronavirus\" and \"COVID-19\" and gathered 923 outcomes across 34 nations, with most in the US (39%) and the EU (Italy made up 25% of the ad showcases). A system for COVID-19 detection utilizing information found from smartphones' sensors, for example, cameras, microphones, temperature and inertial sensors is proposed in Refs. [41]. On the other hand, sound information received from a cell phone's microphone is utilized for cough type detection [42]. This information is significant for AI calculations to learn and foresee the contamination threat of every being, subsequently helping in early identification of high-risk cases for quarantine purpose, thus diminishing the spread of the infection to the helpless populations [43]. A few drones are utilized to trail people, not applying facemasks, while others are utilized to broadcast information to bigger crowds and furthermore to sanitize open spaces. Small-Multi-Copter [44], a Shenzhen-based innovation, has assisted with decreasing the infection transmission hazard in city-wide transport of clinical supplies and quarantine materials through drones. To battle the spread of the novel coronavirus spread in India, the administrations launched Aarogya Setu [45] mobile application that trails coronavirus cases around and helps in battling the infection on an individual level. It helps in tracking the coronavirus contamination by utilizing the cell-phone's GPS framework and Bluetooth and give data that will help in deciding whether you have been close to a COVID-19 tainted individual or not.",
