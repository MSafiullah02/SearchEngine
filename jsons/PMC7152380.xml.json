If the clinician is certain the patient has a disease based on clinical presentation and prevalence (high pretest probability), then the decision to treat will likely not be altered by the test result and testing should not be ordered. Similarly, testing should not be ordered if the clinician has a high degree of a priori certainty that the patient does not have a disease, because the decision not to treat will likely not be altered by the test result. Testing is most useful when the clinician is uncertain about the probability of disease and the result can sway the physician's decision about treatment. In addition to the pretest probability, several factors affect this decision. For example, if therapy comes at a low harm (in terms of toxicity, dollar cost, and selection of resistance), then treating all patients without testing may be appropriate. If the diagnostic has a low sensitivity (i.e., the test is positive in a low percentage of patients with disease), then testing may lead to an inappropriate decision not to treat. Similarly, if a diagnostic has a low specificity (i.e., the test is positive in a high percentage of patients without disease), then testing may lead to unnecessary treatment. The determination that clinical suspicion is uncertain enough to benefit from a particular diagnostic involves the interplay of the cost and accuracy of the diagnostic test, the pretest probability of the disease, and the benefit and harm of treatment.",

Alerting laboratory staff reduces the exposure risk of laboratory staff handling specimens and cultures harboring highly virulent pathogens. A list of such pathogens is shown Table 17-1\n. Not all specimens from patients with infectious diseases should be handled by the on-site laboratory. According to guidelines developed by local and national public health officials, specimens potentially containing selected high-risk agents such as Bacillus anthracis spores, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, variola major, hemorrhagic fever viruses, or Clostridium botulinum toxin are directly sent to the public health laboratories, where appropriate containment facilities and diagnostic tools are applied to make a diagnosis. Other pathogens that are handled by the on-site laboratory but still require laboratory notification include Coccidioides and Brucella species, because cultures of these are associated with a high risk for laboratory-associated infection. Although the technologists are expected to handle all specimens and microbiologic cultures using universal precautions, accidental exposures can happen, especially if the findings are unexpected. Therefore laboratory notification serves to alert the staff to protect themselves from potential exposure to highly transmissible agents.",

First the provider must formulate a comprehensive yet pragmatic differential diagnosis that takes into account the clinical presentation, immune status, and the exposure history of the patient. Then the clinician must order the correct set of laboratory tests and ensure collection of the appropriate specimens and their placement in correct transport containers as well as their transport to the laboratory under permissive conditions for testing. Because improper test selection and specimen collection could reduce the analytic sensitivity and specificity of assays performed in the laboratory, syndromic order sets have been designed that consider the most common pathogens for the specific syndrome. Syndromic order sets incorporate general guidelines for the types of specimen required, collection and transport, and available assays for pathogens expected in a given clinical setting or syndrome. By prioritizing diagnostics that maximize yield and avoiding the need to repeat invasive procedures, these order sets also serve to minimize risk to the patient and to lower health care costs. However, it is the responsibility of the clinician to ensure that specimen requirements are met and the most critical tests are prioritized, especially when the amount of specimen material obtained is limited and multiple tests are ordered. Table 17-2, Table 17-3, Table 17-4\nshow syndromic order sets for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, and immunocompromised host pneumonia, respectively. Order sets developed to address local epidemiologic characteristics and preanalytic practices may be tailored to serve each institution. Clinicians also should familiarize themselves with local sample storage practices in case additional tests need to be performed.",

            "text": "In general, sterile specimens such as tissue samples and aspirates are the most valuable diagnostically because the absence of contamination with commensal organisms ensures that any organism detected likely represents a true pathogen. Histopathologic examination of tissue also provides information on the immunopathologic characteristics of the infectious process. However, a major diagnostic challenge of lower respiratory tract infection is that lower respiratory tract secretions are usually obtained through the oropharynx, which normally contains 1010 to 1012\ncolony-forming units (CFU) of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria per milliliter. Therefore lower respiratory tract secretions collected for microbiologic examination are commonly contaminated with diverse bacteria (Table 17-5\n),6 some of which, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria meningitidis, can also be pathogens of the lower respiratory tract.7, 8, 9 The oropharynx can also contain Mycoplasma pneumoniae\n10 and aerobic actinomycetes including Nocardia and nontuberculous mycobacteria in the absence of disease.11 In addition, aspiration of even minute amounts (0.1 to 1 \u00b5L) of oropharyngeal secretions can deliver a bolus of 109 CFU to the tracheobronchial tree. The distinction in such cases between colonization of the upper respiratory tract and pneumonia cannot be easily made by sputum examination and culture. Another challenge is that oropharyngeal secretions, which normally contain only a few gram-negative bacilli (such as Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter), often become colonized with as many as 107 CFU of gram-negative bacilli per milliliter in seriously ill patients requiring intensive care,12 patients treated with antibiotics after hospitalization for acute pulmonary inflammatory disease,13 chronic alcoholic and diabetic patients,14 institutionalized older adults and chronically ill patients,15 and hospitalized patients with acute leukemia.16 Lastly, Aspergillus spores present in the environment are commonly deposited in the lower respiratory tract and may be recovered from sputum in the absence of disease, although in immunocompromised patients it is best to consider this finding seriously.17 In summary, because lower respiratory tract secretions collected through the oropharynx are nearly always contaminated with resident microflora of the oral cavity and definitive diagnosis would require sterile lung tissue with demonstration of parenchymal invasion, appropriate steps must be taken to obtain specimens of highest quality for microbiologic testing.",

The first requirement for collection of a good-quality sputum specimen is an alert and cooperative patient who can be instructed to rinse out his or her mouth with water or even brush his or her teeth before producing a lower respiratory tract specimen. The patient then must be encouraged to cough deeply to expectorate a specimen of lower respiratory tract secretions. With some infections such as tuberculosis (TB), a larger sample volume can improve the sensitivity of culture.19 Specimens are to be collected in sterile, leakproof, screw-capped containers. Containers should be transported in a watertight plastic biohazard bag.",

Although there were no significant differences in the culture results between the immediate and delayed cultures in this study, the loss of reliable microscopic features had significant impact on the interpretation of culture results. Processing delay is particularly important for culture recovery of slow-growing mycobacteria.24 Specimens that are not sent to the laboratory for processing within 2 hours should be refrigerated for no more than 5 days. If refrigeration is not possible, samples should be treated first with equal volume of 0.6% cetylpyridinium bromide or 1% cetylpyridinium chloride in 2% sodium chloride, which reduces the survival of contaminating microorganisms while preserving the viability of M. tuberculosis for up to 8 days.24, 25, 26 Although the recovery of fungi is optimal from cultures of fresh specimens, most clinically significant fungi appear to survive storage of 16 days or longer.27 Specimens for viral cultures should be shipped refrigerated but not frozen, whereas specimens for chlamydial culture should be placed into sucrose phosphate medium and shipped frozen.",

Flocked swabs contain perpendicular arrangements of fibers with an open structure to create a highly absorbent thin layer capable of efficient uptake of respiratory samples and elution into viral transport media. Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs have been shown to be more sensitive for the detection of respiratory viruses than traditional swabs.31, 32 In turn, nasopharyngeal aspirates or washes have been shown to be more sensitive than nasopharyngeal flocked swabs.33, 34, 35 However, the modest gains in sensitivity for detection of most respiratory viruses using aspirates or washes may be offset by the ease of nasopharyngeal specimen collection using flocked swabs.

For bacterial cultures, microscopic examination of sputum and endotracheal aspirate with Gram stain is used to screen samples for adequate quality.18, 74 The presence of excessive squamous epithelial cells (>10 to 25 per low-power field) is indicative of oropharyngeal contamination and therefore grounds for rejection for bacterial culture (Fig. 17-1\n). Although earlier criteria for the adequacy of sputum specimens for bacterial cultures also required the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils), the number of neutrophils in a sample is no longer used to evaluate specimen adequacy.75 Endotracheal aspirates are rejected if the screening Gram-stained smears show no organisms.74, 76 For mycobacterial, fungal, and viral cultures, cytologic screening to determine specimen acceptability is not enforced, because contamination with commensals does not interfere with interpretation of the culture results. However, the presence of respiratory columnar epithelial cells has been shown to improve respiratory virus detection by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing.77\n",

Microscopy does routinely provide valuable information on the quality of specimen and the type of inflammatory response present. Specimens demonstrating a preponderance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, ciliated columnar epithelial cells, or alveolar macrophages with few, if any, squamous epithelial cells (<10 per low-power field) represent lower respiratory tract secretions. The presence of alveolar macrophages is a more specific marker of lower respiratory tract secretions than neutrophils and is more likely to be associated with a significantly lower incidence of oropharyngeal contamination.81 The finding of neutrophils with intracellular organisms is considered indicative of an active infectious process.82, 83, 84\n",

As expected, improving the sensitivity of the Gram stain examination by lowering the criteria for positivity resulted in reduced specificity in the diagnosis of pneumococcal infection. Similar levels of sensitivity of Gram-stained smears have been reported by others in identifying pneumococci as well as H. influenzae (Fig. 17-3\n) in sputum specimens from patients with acute CAP.86, 87 For the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia, a combination of Gram-stained smear and culture of sputum can yield the correct diagnosis in more than 80% of patients who received less than 24 hours of effective antibiotic therapy.88\n",

In most studies the carbolfuchsin-based stain has a sensitivity of 60% or lower compared to culture.90 The fluorochrome stain, which uses fluorescent dye such as auramine or auramine-rhodamine to highlight mycobacteria, is on average 10% more sensitive than carbolfuchsin90 and is therefore the method recommended by the World Health Organization for screening sputum smears for mycobacteria. The sensitivity of acid-fast microscopy depends on the bacillary burden, sample volume, host immune status, staining method, and other variables.91 The major limiting factor is that approximately 104 acid-fast bacilli per milliliter of sputum must be present to be visualized under light microscopy using an acid-fast stain.91 The insensitivity of smear microscopy for TB therefore necessitates the use of more sensitive methods such as culture and nucleic acid tests.92, 93 In addition, although acid-fast stains have high specificity, they cannot distinguish between M. tuberculosis complex and nontuberculous mycobacteria, and carbolfuchsin stains also stain Legionella micdadei (also known as Tatlockia micdadei).94 Modified acid-fast stain, a modified carbolfuchsin stain, is used for direct staining of partially acid-fast\u2013positive organisms such as Nocardia, Tsukamurella, Rhodococcus, and Gordonia.5\n",

For cultivation of particular groups or species of microorganisms, laboratories must inoculate processed samples on one or more culture media supplemented with nutrients suitable for cultivation of the desired microorganisms and inhibitors for selective inhibition of undesirable organisms. The clinician must therefore be aware that, although many organisms do grow on routine aerobic and anaerobic cultures, a number of respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Histoplasma capsulatum require pathogen-specific growth conditions (growth supplements, temperature and carbon dioxide requirements, and incubation times), which have to be specified when fastidious pathogens are part of the differential diagnosis.5 For example, Legionella species require culture media supplemented with l-cysteine and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (buffered charcoal yeast extract),95 slow-growing mycobacteria require media enriched with a lipid extract and antimicrobials to limit the growth of oral commensals,91 and H. capsulatum requires extended incubation time up to 4 weeks.108 Although most Nocardia species grow well on mycobacterial culture media as well as on ordinary bacterial and fungal culture media, optimal recovery from clinical specimens is obtained by using the same buffered charcoal yeast extract culture medium as that for the isolation of Legionella.\n109\n",

Quantitative cultures are also performed on certain respiratory specimens such as protected catheter brush specimens and BAL fluid.110 Nonetheless, a randomized trial found that in mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia, the use of quantitative BAL and nonquantitative endotracheal aspirate cultures resulted in similar clinical outcomes, although patients known to be colonized or infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were excluded and antibiotics were withheld until the results of culture were available.52 Bacteria present in quantities greater than 103 CFU/mL in cultures of protected catheter brushes48 and in quantities greater than 104 CFU/mL in cultures of BAL fluids50 are defined by the laboratory as positive and identified and tested for their susceptibility to appropriate antimicrobial agents.111 The diagnostic value of break points of bacterial growth (i.e., 103 to 105 CFU/mL) depends not only on the type of microbiologic processing used but also on the relationship of two variables: the concentration of pathogens present in the BAL fluid and the degree of contamination of the bronchoscopic channel through which lavage fluid was injected and aspirated. Other variables affecting the sensitivity of BAL specimens include antibiotic administration and the volume of lavage fluid injected and the volume of fluid retrieved.112 Diagnostic specificity depends greatly on techniques used to minimize contamination of the specimen by upper respiratory flora, such as discarding the first aliquot of aspirated fluid.113\n",

There are several aspects of this in vitro testing that are important to understand. First of all, testing methods and interpretation of results must be done according to accepted standards, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for the various categories of organism. Second, the selection of antibiotics to test and report is determined in collaboration with CLSI/EUCAST guidelines, the hospital formulary, infectious disease specialists, the pharmacy, and the infection prevention committee. Third, antimicrobial susceptibility testing should not be performed when the pathogen has a predictable susceptibility profile (e.g., all Streptococcus pyogenes are currently susceptible to penicillin), nor is susceptibility testing needed for a specific antibiotic when an organism has intrinsic resistance to that antibiotic (e.g., Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter spp., and Serratia spp. are all intrinsically resistant to ampicillin). The bacterial pathogens from the lower respiratory tract, for which the susceptibility profile is not predictable and thus antimicrobial susceptibility testing is commonly performed, are S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and other nonfermenting gram-negative rods. Fourth, because antimicrobial susceptibility testing measures in vitro activity, other factors must be considered when determining in vivo activity, including antimicrobial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and patient-specific factors such as immune status.",

Results generated by each method are reported as: \u201csusceptible,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d or \u201cresistant.\u201d Susceptible implies the organism will likely respond to treatment with the antibiotic at a standard dosage. Intermediate may be effective if higher dosing can be used (e.g., \u03b2-lactams) or the antibiotic being used concentrates at the site of infection (e.g., fluoroquinolones for urinary tract infections). Resistant implies the organism is not likely to respond to therapy with that antibiotic. The interpretation criteria (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are specific to each organism-drug combination as well as to pharmacokinetic (e.g., peak serum levels, protein binding, and clearance rate of the drug) and pharmacodynamic (e.g., whether the rate of bacterial killing is concentration dependent) characteristics of each drug. Therefore, because the measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration alone does not capture these multiple considerations, simply choosing a drug on the basis of the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration in a susceptibility report is not recommended.",

With the unique capabilities of molecular diagnostic tests and the need for rapid, sensitive detection of respiratory pathogens, molecular assays will continue to gain an increasing role in the diagnosis and management of patients with opportunistic and community-acquired pneumonia. Most NATs are based on amplification and detection of nucleic acid targets specific to the pathogens of interest. NATs offer several advantages over conventional direct examination, microbiologic cultures, and serologic assays. First, NATs have the ability to detect and identify pathogens rapidly (in hours). Second, NATs provide the only means of detection for some microorganisms that are difficult or impossible to grow in culture. Certain viruses, for example, are very difficult to cultivate by conventional culture-based methods, and NATs enable detection of these organisms in clinical specimens.139 Third, NATs make possible detection of pathogens, such as M. tuberculosis, in resource-limited settings where laboratory infrastructure for culture is lacking.140, 141 Finally, for some pathogens, NATs allow determination of antimicrobial susceptibility directly from respiratory tract specimens.",

Accuracy studies have indicated that most of these assays are at least comparable to, if not better than, conventional culture, direct antigen, and/or serologic detection methods, especially when examining respiratory specimens that contain low numbers of pathogens. For example, a rapid PCR assay has been applied for the diagnosis of an outbreak of Chlamydia psittaci that resulted from transmission of this infectious agent to humans from birds purchased in stores; in this outbreak, PCR detected 50% more cases than did culture.156 Compared to culture and serologic tests, PCR was also shown to be the most sensitive method for detection of C. pneumoniae during an outbreak of CAP.157 However, NAT results should be interpreted with caution because NATs currently cannot differentiate between organisms that inhabit the upper airway without causing disease and those that are responsible for the patient's illness. For example, as mentioned, S. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae may inhabit the upper airway without causing disease.6, 10 Similarly, the lowered diagnostic specificity of P. jirovecii NATs is likely due to the detection of P. jirovecii nucleic acid from cysts that are present in low numbers and in a latent state in pulmonary tissues of asymptomatic patients.158, 159, 160\n",

It is imperative that testing is strictly limited to samples obtained from sterile sources because contamination of the sample with commensal organisms or environmental spores could yield false-positive results and lead to mismanagement of the patient.163, 164 Sequence results must always be correlated with clinical, histopathologic, and ancillary test results (antibody or antigen detection) to ensure the clinical accuracy of sequence results.",

Following the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, there was a tremendous increase in the availability and widespread implementation of real-time PCR assays for influenza and other respiratory viruses. These real-time PCR assays include those endorsed by the CDC, as well as numerous laboratory-developed and commercially produced tests.139 However, in-house real-time PCR tests are of high complexity, requiring experienced and highly skilled staff, as well as specialized molecular diagnostic laboratory facilities. Furthermore, these tests are generally batched, thereby prolonging the turnaround time and reducing clinical utility. Finally, real-time PCR allows only a moderate level of multiplexing (i.e., use of primers and probes for detecting multiple targets in the same reaction), a potential issue for detecting a broad range of respiratory viruses with a limited number of reactions. To address these issues, a variety of commercial test systems have been developed, though no single system provides comprehensive detection of clinically relevant respiratory viruses with optimal sensitivity in a format that can be performed at or near the point of care. Three groups of molecular testing now exist, with different levels of technical and personnel demands (referred to as moderate or high complexity, as established by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments).",

The xTAG RVPs achieve high-level multiplexing through the combination of target amplicon labeling with universal, minimally cross-hybridizing, complementary oligonucleotide sequences and flow cytometric detection using a solution-phase array composed of spectrally distinct microspheres.173 In approximately 8 hours, RVPv1 detects influenza A, including subtyping H1 and H3, influenza B, RSV A, RSV B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus. Compared to RVPv1, RVP FAST has a shorter time to result (about 6 hours); however, it does not detect the parainfluenza viruses, and it does not distinguish between RSV types. Several studies have compared the clinical performance of the xTAG RVPs and found that both the xTAG RVPv1 and RVP FAST panels are more sensitive than traditional respiratory virus testing methodologies, less sensitive than in-house real-time PCR, and that RVPv1 is more sensitive than RVP FAST.174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180 Of note, these assays demonstrate low sensitivity for adenoviruses and do not distinguish between the closely related picornaviruses, rhinovirus, and enterovirus.",

At present, one assay is available in this category: the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics; Salt Lake City, UT), which integrates sample preparation, nested-PCR amplification, real-time fluorescent detection, and analysis in a single assay pouch.182 In about 1 hour, including less than 5 minutes of hands-on time, this assay detects influenza A, including H1, 2009 H1, and H3 subtyping, influenza B, RSV, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63. In addition, it detects three bacterial species: Bordetella pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae. Clinical performance is similar to xTAG RVPv1, demonstrating higher sensitivity than traditional respiratory virus testing methodologies and lower sensitivity compared to in-house real-time PCR.177, 179, 180, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188 The current Film Array Respiratory Panel also has low sensitivity for adenoviruses, does not distinguish between rhinovirus and enterovirus, and has low throughput, because only one test can be performed on an instrument at a time. However, its rapid turnaround and ease of use allows most laboratories to perform multiplexed molecular respiratory virus testing. In the future it is expected that assays in this category will improve sensitivity, specificity, and throughput to create optimal, rapid multiplex molecular respiratory virus tests.",

Galactomannan detected in serum by enzyme immunoassay can aid in the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, with pooled diagnostic sensitivity of 71% (95% CI, 68% to 74%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI, 88% to 90%) for proven cases of invasive aspergillosis.203 The reported sensitivity and specificity range from 40% to 100% and 56% to 100%, respectively, in various patient groups17, 147, 204, 205, 206 The Platelia Aspergillus test (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), a commercially available assay that detects galactomannan from A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, A. versicolor, and A. terres, has been shown to yield positive results at an early stage of infection, with positive and negative predictive values of more than 90% in high-risk patients who were tested biweekly.204 However, this assay may cross react with Histoplasma, P. brasiliensis, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Alternaria, and Cryptococcus,\n206, 207, 208 and false-positive galactomannan antigen assay results can be observed in patients receiving certain foods or intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin, or ticarcillin.208, 209, 210, 211 Cross reactivity with Listeria monocytogenes has also been reported.212 BAL fluid specimens from lung transplant recipients have also been evaluated for testing by Aspergillus galactomannan detection assay, with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 96%.213 Of note, the Plasma-Lyte (Baxter International Inc., Deerfield, IL) solution commonly used to perform BAL has been found to yield false-positive results with the Platelia Aspergillus test.214 Overall, assays for galactomannan show promise, but currently a single positive result has limited value and cross reactivity is common.",

Serologic testing is used commonly to identify infections due to pathogens that are difficult to detect by other conventional methods, to evaluate the course of an infection, and to determine the nature of the infection (primary infection versus reinfection, acute versus chronic infection). Serologic testing and IGRAs are less sensitive in patients with compromised immune systems and therefore cannot be used to rule out infection.227, 228, 229 When possible, microbiologic culture and NATs on respiratory secretions or lung tissue should be performed to detect and confirm the presence of pathogens in immunosuppressed patients who may not be able to mount antibody or cell-mediated immune responses.",

Serologic results are often expressed as a titer, which is the inverse of the greatest dilution, or lowest concentration of a patient's serum that retains measurable specific antibody-antigen reactivity (e.g., dilution of 1 : 16 = titer of 16). A fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera is usually required for diagnosis. An elevated pathogen-specific IgM antibody titer in a single serum sample suggests recent infection, and a falling titer provides further support for the etiologic significance of this organism. However, false-positive immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody tests are not rare. Thus serologic testing of pathogen-specific IgG antibody in acute and convalescent sera remains the approach to establish a specific microbial cause of the infection.230\n",

Although antibody testing is commonly used for the detection of infection with M. pneumoniae, a recent study was unable to distinguish between infection and asymptomatic colonization with this organism.10 The diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection can also be a problem. In some additional instances, such as infection with M. tuberculosis, commercial serologic tests have been shown to be inconsistent and imprecise, which is the basis of World Health Organization policy statement advising against use of existing serologic tests in TB.232\n",

Antibodies to a chloroform-methanol glycolipid extract of M. pneumoniae are detected by a CF test in more than 85% of culture-positive patients; a single elevated titer of greater than 80 or a greater than fourfold rise in titer between acute and convalescent sera is required to establish a diagnosis. Enzyme immunoassays to detect IgM and IgA antibodies that specifically recognize M. pneumoniae membrane proteins have been developed with improved sensitivity and specificity over the CF assay.233 Specific IgM antibodies appear during the first week of illness and reach peak titers during the third week. However, the IgM antibodies to M. pneumoniae are not consistently produced in adults because of prior sensitization, so that a negative IgM result does not rule out acute M. pneumoniae infection, particularly in older adults. Detection of specific IgA antibodies in the serum has been shown by one group to be a reliable approach for diagnosis, because these antibodies are also produced early in the course of disease and more reliably present in the infected individuals regardless of age.233 Others, however, found them of little value.10\n",

Antibodies to C. immitis can be detected by ID, CF, and enzyme immunoassay.

IGRAs were developed as an alternative to the tuberculin skin test (TST) for diagnosis of LTBI.245, 246 Compared to the TST, IGRAs have improved specificity for distinguishing between the responses due to bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and latent TB infection, because the antigens used in IGRAs, ESAT-6 and CFP-10, are absent from all strains of BCG. Also, compared to the TST, IGRAs offer logistical advantages because they do not depend on accurate intradermal injection and patients do not have to return to a health facility for the result to be read.244 However, like TSTs, IGRAs cannot distinguish between LTBI and active disease.247 The sensitivity of IGRAs in culture-positive active TB cases has ranged from 65% to 100%,244, 248, 249 and the sensitivity in patients with LTBI who progressed to active TB ranged from 40% to 100%.250 Both IGRAs and the TST have been shown to have similar sensitivity in adults in low- and middle-income countries.251 However, the accuracy of IGRA testing appears to falter at the borderline levels of positivity. Studies conducted in health care workers in low-incidence settings have shown highly variable IGRA results with serial testing. The rate of conversions (negative to positive result using the manufacturer- and CDC-recommended cutoff of \u22650.35 IU/mL) ranged from 2% to 15%, and the rate of reversions (positive to negative result) ranged from 20% to 40%.252, 253 Those with borderline results around the assay cutoff are more likely to revert or convert. Finally, there are limitations to the use of IGRAs. IGRA results have not proven useful for monitoring response to TB treatment. Similarly, IGRAs are no more able than the TST to predict which patients with positive results will go on to develop active TB.254, 255 Currently, therefore, IGRA is most useful as an alternative to the TST, especially in subject populations with a high incidence of BCG vaccination.",
