Experience with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to have confirmed these findings.",

The ratio of detected to undetected cases (1:1\u00b78, 95% HPDI 0\u00b75\u20133\u00b74) indicates that about 64% of imported cases have not been detected.",

This percentage is probably the lower bound since detection capacity was estimated relative to that in Singapore, which was probably not 100% efficient.2 The relatively lower prevalence of COVID-19 among short-term visitors compared with residents of Wuhan has contributed to the underestimation.2 However, Niehus and colleagues conclude that it is more acceptable than the effect of underdetection.",

The virus identified in Wuhan might not be the first generation.6, 7 The high case-fatality rate in Wuhan is probably because the detection ability of viral nucleic acid was insufficient in the early stages of the outbreak. Most patients with mild disease had no access to a medical diagnosis and were excluded from calculation of the case-fatality rate, which was primarily contributed to by patients with severe disease.8 Makeshift hospitals began to be built on Feb 4, 2020, in Wuhan, for medical care of patients with mild disease, and subsequent detection and treatment of mild cases decreased the number of deaths (numerator) while increasing the total number of cases (denominator).9 Outside Hubei province, a lower case-fatality rate of 0\u00b79% (121 of 13 500) has been attributed to perfect detection.10 People in China (outside Hubei province) who visited any place outside of their regular residential area received a test, whereas people with no symptoms would be home quarantined for 14 days, particularly those who had recently visited Hubei province, who would be strictly followed up through home visits and by telephone by community management staff.",

In this case, models fitted by early data probably produce results divorced from reality.
