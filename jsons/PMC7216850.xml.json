[5] reported that the severity of COVID-19 is associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), which resembles the cytokine profile observed in cases of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [6]. This is supported by a recent report by Mehta et al. [7] in which all 35 patients with severe COVID-19 showed hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirates, cytopenia of two or more lineages, and increased serum ferritin levels (\u2265 2000 ng/mL). Control of hypercytokinemia is key to successfully treating sHLH/MAS. However, the effectiveness of cytokine blocking with anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 on sHLH/MAS has been limited [6].",

            "text": "The most common trigger for sHLH/MAS is a viral infection, which stimulates macrophages to release inflammatory cytokine and perform phagocytosis of virus-infected cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are subsequently activated through their antigen-presenting function, and hypercytokinemia occurs, resulting in virus-infected cells undergoing perforin-mediated cell lysis. Finally, the activated CTLs selectively eliminate the activated macrophages, and sHLH/MAS naturally resolves [8]. However, unlike other virus infections, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) initially activates CTLs to induce hypercytokinemia directly and indirectly, thereby allowing for prolonged antigen presentation by macrophages, which causes CTLs to fail to eliminate activated macrophages; this lack of normal feedback regulation results in excessive macrophage activity and hypercytokinemia, thereby leading to the development of organ damage, cytopenia, and coagulopathy [8] (Fig. 1). It is reasonable to assume that COVID-19 causes a similar pathophysiology to EBV-associated sHLH/MAS, as there are common abnormalities in both diseases, such as hypercytokinemia, macrophage activation, cytopenias, immunological abnormalities in CD8-positive cells, and the rapid development and progression of organ damage and coagulopathy [1, 2, 5, 7, 9].",

            "text": "Etoposide is a chemotherapeutic drug widely used to treat various types of cancer, including lymphoma, leukemia, and lung cancer, and promotes apoptosis of cancer cells by inhibiting the topoisomerase II enzyme. Etoposide is also known to be effective at low doses in combination with cyclosporine and steroids for familial HLH [10]. However, such combination therapy may be too immunosuppressive to eliminate virus-infected cells in cases of virus-associated sHLH/MAS. Low-dose etoposide monotherapy, e.g. a single dose of 100\u2013150 mg/m2, 1\u20133 cycles, has been successfully used to treat sHLH/MAS associated with EBV and autoimmune diseases, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, with a response rate of \u2265 80% reported [8, 11, 12]. Evidence supporting the usefulness of etoposide treatment for sHLH/MAS can also be seen in a previous report [13], in which low-dose etoposide substantially alleviated all symptoms of murine HLH and prolonged the survival through the selective depletion of activated CTLs and suppression of their inflammatory cytokine production. Importantly, low-dose etoposide essentially spares quiescent na\u00efve and memory T cells while ablating activated T cells [13, 14]. In another mouse model study [15], the combination of low-dose etoposide and prednisolone improved the survival rate of fatal ARDS model mice with hypercytokinemia and hemophagocytosis, which were induced by administration of \u03b1-galactosylceramide and lipopolysaccharide, through suppressing the intrapulmonary recruitment and activation of macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and neutrophils. Low-dose etoposide monotherapy also improved pulmonary edema. Besides, the early introduction of low-dose etoposide was found to be effective in patients with EBV-related sHLH/MAC with respiratory failure [16]. These findings suggest that low-dose etoposide improves hypercytokinemia, renew CTLs so that activated macrophages and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are eliminated, and thus immunomodulatory abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are restored, potentially improving COVID-19 with ARDS (Fig. 1).",
