Comparison of primary sequences of different DNA strands remains the upmost important aspect of the sequence analysis. So far, most comparison methods are based on string alignment (Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Lake, 1994): a distance function is used to represent insertion, deletion, and substitution of letters in the compared strings. Using the distance function, one can compare DNA primary sequences and resolve the questions of the homology of macromolecules. However, it is not easy to use for long sequences since it is realized with the aid of dynamic programming, which will be slow due to the large number of computational steps.",

Some new methods have been derived with a variety of theoretical foundations. One category out of these methods is based on the statistics of word frequency within a DNA sequence (Sitnikova and Zharkikh, 1993, Karlin and Burge, 1995, Wu et al., 1997, Wu et al., 2001, Stuart et al., 2002, Qi et al., 2004). The core idea is that the more similar the two sequences are, the greater the number of the factors shared by two sequences is. The earliest publication using frequencies statistics of k-words for sequence comparison dates from 1986 (Blaisdell, 1986). Three years after, Blaisdell (1989) proved that the dissimilarity values observed by using distance measures based on word frequencies are directly related to the ones requiring sequence alignment. In recent years, many researchers employ the k-words and the Markov model to obtain the information about the biological sequences (Pham and Zuegg, 2004, Pham, 2007, Kantorovitz et al., 2007, Helden, 2004, Dai et al., 2008).",

According to the representation, some numerical characterizations are selected as invariants of sequence for comparisons of DNA primary sequences. The advantage of these methods is that they provide a simple way of viewing, sorting and comparing various gene structures. But how to obtain suitable invariants to characterize DNA sequences and compare them is still a question need our attention.",

Since then, alignment-free methods based on CGR have aroused much interest in the field of computational biology. Further studies by Almeida et al. (2001) showed that CGR is a generalized Markov chain probability table which can accommodate non-integer orders, and that CGR is a powerful sequence modelling tool because of its computational efficiency and scale-independence (Almeida and Vinga, 2002, Almeida and Vinga, 2006, Almeida and Vinga, 2009).

Apparently, DM satisfies distance conditions (a)\u2013(c). It is not obvious that it also satisfies (d). The following proposition answers this. Proposition 1\nDM(x,y) satisfies the triangle inequality, that is\nDM(x,z)\u2264DM(x,y)+DM(y,z).\nProofSuppose s is an arbitrary element of \u0394(x,z). If s is also contained in \u0394(x,y), clearly we can obtain that DM(x\u2192z)\u2264DM(x\u2192y)+DM(y\u2192z). If there exists an element t\u2208\u0394(x,z), and t is not contained in \u0394(x,y), then we can derive t\u2208\u0394(y,z), therefore the triangle inequality DM(x\u2192z)\u2264DM(x\u2192y)+DM(y\u2192z) still comes into existence. Similarly, we can prove that DM(z\u2192x)\u2264DM(y\u2192x)+DM(z\u2192y).Let a=DM(x\u2192z), b=DM(z\u2192x), c=DM(x\u2192y), d=DM(y\u2192x), e=DM(y\u2192z), f=DM(z\u2192y), we need to show a2+b2\u2264c2+d2+e2+f2.Since a2+b2\u2264(c+e)2+(d+f)2,it is sufficient to prove the following inequality: (c+e)2+(d+f)2\u2264c2+d2+e2+f2.This is equivalent to, by squaring both sides of the above inequality, ce+df\u2264(c2+d2)(e2+f2).To prove this inequality, we just need to prove (ce+df)2\u2264(c2+d2)(e2+f2),i.e. 2cedf\u2264e2d2+c2f2. Obviously, this inequality comes into existence. Therefore, a2+b2\u2264c2+d2+e2+f2.Hence DM(x,y) satisfies the triangle inequality.  \u25a1\n",

Our algorithm is not necessarily an improvement as compared to some existing methods, but an alternative for the similarity analysis of DNA sequences. The new approach does not require sequence alignment and graphical representation, and besides, it is fully automatic. The whole operation process utilizes the entire information contained in the DNA sequences and do not require any human intervention. The application of the DM algorithm to the sets of \u03b2-globin genes and coronavirus genomes demonstrates its utility. This method will also be useful to researchers who are interested in evolutionary analysis.",
