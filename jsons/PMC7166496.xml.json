Periodic dilatation and contraction of the heart is caused by a complicated interaction between biological electrocardiac signals and mechanical forces (Kwon et al., 2016). The heart vessels consist largely of endothelium, vascular smooth muscle and adventitia. The four valves open or close precisely on differential blood pressure, which is mainly made up of endothelial cells (ECs) and interstitial cells (ICs; Liu, Joag, & Gotlieb, 2007; Taylor, Batten, Brand, Thomas, & Yacoub, 2003). The atria and ventricles are divided by valves to prevent blood reflux, and the principal cell type of the heart chambers is cardiomyocytes (CMs). Besides, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) produce the extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold of the heart and are estimated to constitute more than half of total heart cells (Bergmann et al., 2015).",

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation of the Hunan Normal University (Protocol 259/2012) and the experiments were carried out according to the ethical guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology of China, 2006). The heart anatomy of rhesus monkey was previously reported to be similar to that of human (Sleeper, Gaughan, Gleason, & Burkett, 2008). The harvest of vessels, valves, and myocardial tissues was done by an experienced cardiologist under the assistance of a veterinary. At first, discreetly isolated coronary vessels ran at the surface of heart from myocardium and then harvested them. After that, opened the left atrium (LA) and the left ventricular (LV) wall was dissected starting at the anterolateral commissure to harvest LA and LV myocardial tissues, and anterior, and posterior mitral leaflets. The similar process was performed for the right heart to collect the right atrium and ventricular myocardial tissues. The chordae tendineae consisted in atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid) was not to be taken as the valve samples, as its distinctive organizational structure and cell types differed from semilunar aortic and pulmonary valves. Finally, the rest of valves were obtained after opening the aorta and pulmonary artery. Besides, the heart was identified with normal size and structure and without heart disease, that is, no signs of hypertrophy, atrophy or scar of myocardium, thickening, shortening, or stiffening of valves and atherosclerosis of great vessels, by using visual inspection of the gross appearance of explanted tissue by the cardiologist during the tissue harvest process.

The common marmoset with SARS\u2010associated coronavirus infection is suited for understanding SARS pathogenesis, and will allow for efficient testing of vaccines and various treatment modalities (Greenough et al., 2005).

Monkey model of myocardial infarction is generated by ischemia followed by reperfusion to study the extent of remuscularization of the infarcted heart by transplanting human cardiomyocyte (Chong et al., 2014). Acute myocardial infarction is also induced in monkey by left anterior descending artery ligation (Yang et al., 2011; Yoshioka et al., 2005). Adhesion molecule P\u2010selectin of coronary endothelium is overexpressed in a monkey heart ischemia reperfusion model, which allow stable adherence with leukocytes that provide possibility for detecting myocardial ischemia by molecular imaging of P\u2010selectin with targeted ultrasound contrast agents (Kaufmann et al., 2010; Kaufmann, Lewis, Xie, Mirza\u2010Mohd, & Lindner, 2007; Thomas et al., 2010). Sensitive proarrhythmia model establishing by a chronic atrioventricular block in cynomolgus monkey possesses essentially the same pathophysiological adaptations with human (Sugiyama, 2008). CCR5 inhibition observably impacts myocardial viral load and prevents cardiomyocyte functional impairment in SIV\u2010infected macaque model of diastolic dysfunction (Kelly et al., 2014). CCR5 blockade also attenuates postsurgical stress responses and favorably modulates pathogenic alloimmunity in nonhuman primate cardiac allograft model (Schroder et al., 2007). Monkey models of heart disease also serve as a suitable large\u2010animal model to examine diabetic cardiomyopathy (Gong et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2015), postmenopausal atherosclerosis (Melendez et al., 2015), and heart failure (Qiu et al., 2008). Interestingly, the major pathological process of heart disease is different in humans and chimpanzees, although heart disease is common in the two species (Varki et al., 2009). The commonest cause of heart disease in human arises predominantly from coronary artery atherosclerosis, whereas sudden death of cardiac etiology in chimpanzees is generally related to myocardial fibrosis (Varki et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The disturbance in the energy metabolism is inextricably linked with cardiac disorders (Lopaschuk, Ussher, Folmes, Jaswal, & Stanley, 2010). In the GDA study, various genes from heart regions were implicated with several heart illnesses including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Among these, vessel\u2010expressed genes like CS, SDHA, IDH1, and DLAT are enriched in TCA cycle pathway. Citrate synthase (CS), as the rate\u2010limiting enzyme of TCA cycle, reflects mitochondrial oxidative capacity in cardiac tissue (de Castro Bras et al., 2014; Jaenisch, Bertagnolli, Borghi\u2010Silva, Arena, & Lago, 2017). ACAA, ALDH9A1, and HADHB expressed in heart valves can perform these functions in metabolism pathways including amino acid and fatty acid degradation. Besides, the genes in chambers were mostly involved in metabolism pathways including glycolysis and propanoate metabolism pathway.",

Among these proteins, ACTC1, MYBPC, MYL, TNC, TNI, and TPM belonged to sarcomeric or intrasarcomeric protein which enhances Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activity and force production (Gangadharan et al., 2017; Gomez et al., 2014; Sequeira et al., 2013), PRKCG, and RYR consisted in mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, respectively, which increases cytosolic free Ca2+ level, take mutual effort in left ventricle hypertrophy and can potentially lead to heart failure (Rouet\u2010Benzineb et al., 1996; Uenoyama et al., 2010). In terms of ARVC mechanisms, DSG and DSP, which induce loss of electrical coupling between cardiac myocytes and lead to myocyte cell death (Azaouagh, Churzidse, Konorza, & Erbel, 2011; Pilichou et al., 2006), and RYR2, which disrupts normal Ca2+ cycling (Kannankeril et al., 2006; Tang, Tian, Wang, Fill, & Chen, 2012; Yano, Yamamoto, Kobayashi, & Matsuzaki, 2009), indirectly participate in symptomatic right ventricular arrhythmias mediation. In addition, protein kinase A (PKA) and sarcoplasmic protein RYR and PLN destroy intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis resulting in further left ventricle chamber dilation and systolic dysfunction (Gramolini et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2010; Yaniv et al., 2011).",
