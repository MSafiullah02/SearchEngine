It shows circumstantial evidence of a broad spectrum of effects: between a potentially causative or facilitatory role [1, 2] and an inhibitory or protective influence [3, 4], probably depending on the type and age of infection. With regard to the importance of respiratory virus infections in exacerbations of pre\u2010existing asthma, research during the past decade has provided clear positive evidence, from both epidemiological and experimental studies [5, 6]. This is less clear in COPD. Latent virus infections have been implicated in its pathogenesis [7], but this still needs confirmation. Furthermore, there are only very recent data on a potentially (limited?) role of respiratory viruses in causing exacerbations of pre\u2010existing COPD [8].",

Several clinical and epidemiological studies have described a close temporal association of respiratory virus infections with exacerbations in patients with asthma [13]. Respiratory viruses can be identified in 10%\u201344% of the asthma exacerbations in adults [14, 15], whilst in children identification rates vary from 26% to 83% [16, 17, 18, \u201319]. The use of the sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique to detect rhinovirus and coronavirus in the two most recent studies has resulted in the highest identification rates so far [15, 19]. Among the various respiratory viruses identified, rhinovirus predominates in most of these studies, accounting for about 50% of the detected viruses [15, 16, 17, 18, \u201319]. The incidence of rhinovirus infections may even be higher in asthmatic patients as compared with nonasthmatic subjects [13, 20], although rhinovirus shedding in the absence of cold symptoms does not seem to be associated with clinical worsening of asthma [17]. Taken together, these findings indicate that rhinovirus infections may have a causal role in exacerbations of asthma. Preliminary data confirm that this also occurs in exacerbations of COPD, but to a lesser degree [8].",

Such a model allows careful patient selection and monitoring, and intensive assessment of the rhinovirus\u2010induced effects, under controlled circumstances and timing. Thus, the effects of a rhinovirus infection can be assessed at the level of asthma symptoms, changes in use of asthma medication, lung function, and airway hyperresponsiveness, as well as the underlying airway pathology.",

This has been considered to be reassuring in terms of patient\u2010safety of the experimental model; however, recent results from our laboratory are demonstrating that frequent home\u2010recordings of FEV1 (three times daily) do decrease in atopic asthmatic patients in the acute phase of an experimental RV16 infection [27]. Furthermore, the maximal decrease in FEV1 in the acute phase of the infection, expressed as percentage of the recent personal best, correlated significantly with the observed increase in airways hyperresponsiveness [27]. This suggests that there is transient worsening of airways obstruction after rhinovirus infection in asthma, which may improve spontaneously during the day, or as a consequence of repeated deep\u2010breath manoeuvres as are being performed in the lung function laboratory. This points at either increased sensitivity to bronchoconstrictive stimuli and/or a reduced bronchodilating effect of a deep breath [36].",

Lemanske et al. and Gern et al. have demonstrated an enhanced hypersensitivity to histamine and allergen challenge after experimental rhinovirus 16 (RV16) infection in nonasthmatic patients with atopic rhinitis [24, 34], which was significantly different from the lack of response in normals [34]. Others, however, have not observed such an effect when using rhinovirus 39 [35]. In asthmatic subjects, Halperin et al. has found increased hypersensitivity to histamine in only four of 22 subjects after experimental rhinovirus (serotype 39 and HH strain) infection [22]. More recently, in our laboratory Cheung et al. have shown that RV16 increases asthma symptoms, coinciding an increase in the maximal bronchoconstrictive response to methacholine up to 15 days after infection [25], pointing towards the development of excessive airway narrowing due to a rhinovirus infection. In a similar design, we have shown a significant increase in airway sensitivity to histamine in asthmatic subjects after RV16 infection, which was most pronounced in those subjects who had severe cold symptoms [28]. Taken together, these data indicate that patients with asthma and/or atopic rhinitis may suffer more prominent pathophysiological consequences from a rhinovirus infection as compared with nonatopic nonasthmatic subjects, suggesting an interactive effect of virus\u2010induced airways inflammation with features of the underlying disease, such as altered airway geometry [37, 38] and/or pre\u2010existing allergic sensitization/inflammation [39].",

It has not, however, been resolved to what extent such induced inflammation contributes to the accompanying physiological changes. Initial findings suggested a major role of inflammatory cells, such as T cells, basophils, and their mediators [41]. And indeed, virus\u2010induced airway hyperresponsiveness could be transferred by bronchoalveolar lavage cells recovered after viral infection in guinea pigs [42]. However, more recent results obtained by using antibodies against pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, such as IL\u20105, are indicative of (partly) independent induction of airways hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic airways inflammation by respiratory viruses in guinea pigs in vivo [43].",

Interestingly, this seems to be mainly due to impaired inhibitory mechanisms [44]. Such impaired neurogenic protection might arise from reduced production or activity of the neuropeptide degrading enzyme neutral endopeptidasen [45], or to dysfunction of inhibitory cholinergic M2\u2010receptors [46]. In addition, there is evidence that virus\u2010induced airways hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs can be caused by impaired synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) [47]. This is potentially important, since it has recently been shown that rhinovirus can induce NO\u2010synthase expression in human primary bronchial epithelial cells in vitro [48], and that such NO can reduce rhinovirus replication and the induced inflammatory cytokine release by epithelial cells [49]. Interestingly, our latest data in asthmatics in vivo are in keeping with such a protective mechanism by NO after rhinovirus infection (Fig. 1) [50], but this hypothesis remains to be tested using appropriate pharmacological blocking agents in asthmatics in vivo.",

It is likely that epithelial cells are playing an active and major role in this. In vitro, there is evidence that infection with rhinovirus in pulmonary epithelial cells and fibroblasts induces de novo synthesis of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, such as GM\u2010CSF, IL\u201011, and IL\u20106, and the chemokines IL\u20108 and RANTES [51, 52, 53, 54, \u201355] by activating transcription factors such as NF\u2010\u03baB [53, 56, 57]. Such epithelial chemokine release appears to be prolonged until 5 days after in vitro infection [58]. Indeed, during common colds in vivo, these mediators and others were found to be elevated in nasal secretions [28, 57,59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, \u201367] as well as in sputum (IL\u20108, IL\u20106) [30, 68].",

Indeed, a rhinovirus infection is known to lead to infiltration of leucocytes, particularly neutrophils and mononuclear cells, into nasal secretions [68,70, 71, \u201372] rather than the nasal mucosa [59, 70, 73]. Both in normals and asthmatic subjects this occurs in conjunction with an increase in the number of neutrophils in peripheral blood, whereas the number of circulating lymphocytes falls in the acute phase of infection [25, 26, 28, 74]. These effects, as well as the decrease in PC20 in asthmatic subjects, are significantly related to the severity of the cold, as reflected by the cold score [28, 74] and the increase in IL\u20108 in nasal lavage [28], underlining the relationship between the severity of the cold and the pathophysiological consequences [17, 28].",

Interestingly, the numbers of eosinophils remained elevated up to 6 weeks after infection in the six asthmatic subjects [26]. This is in keeping with the increased levels of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in sputum that we have observed after experimental RV16 infection in asthmatics, which correlated significantly with the increase in airway sensitivity to histamine (Fig. 2) [30].

It appears that ICAM\u20101 expression is up\u2010regulated upon stimulation with rhinovirus in pulmonary epithelial cell lines in vitro [55, 56]. This has now been confirmed in vivo in a recent study from our laboratory demonstrating that experimental rhinovirus colds in asthmatics increase epithelial ICAM\u20101 expression in bronchial biopsy specimens [81]. Hence, up\u2010regulation of ICAM\u20101 by secondarily released cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, may facilitate rhinovirus infection in susceptible cell types [52, 55, 82].",

It has been postulated that cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03b3, and IL\u20104 may alter the expression, function, or configuration of ICAM\u20101, thereby specifically promoting (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20104) or impeding (IL\u20106, IL\u20101) lymphocyte adhesion to, for example, cytokine\u2010pretreated fibroblasts or primary tracheal epithelial cells [52, 83, 84]. Rhinovirus binding, however, does not seem to be affected by such cytokine\u2010induced functional changes [52, 83, 84], suggesting that virus\u2010induced pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines may facilitate infection, whilst promoting or inhibiting the interaction between epithelial cells and lymphocytes.",

In addition, from 3 weeks after infection onward, antigen\u2010specific lymphocyte proliferation could be demonstrated [88, 92, 93], indicating a cell\u2010mediated immune response to the infection [85]. Such CD4+ cells may be specific to either serotype\u2010restricted or serotype\u2010shared viral epitopes [85, 94, 95]. A recent report suggests that eosinophils, when expressing ICAM\u20101, may function as APCs, in that they induce T\u2010cell proliferation when incubated with rhinovirus [78].

Even though there were no significant virus\u2010induced changes in percentage eosinophils or ECP levels, the observed changes in these variables were significantly related to those in PC20: the greater the development of airways hyperresponsiveness (decrease in PC20), the greater the increase in percentage of sputum eosinophils or ECP levels.
