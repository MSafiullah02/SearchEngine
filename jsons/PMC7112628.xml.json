Instead of the anticipated influenza virus, the pandemic was caused by, for the first time, a novel coronavirus which was subsequently named the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV).1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Within a few months, the virus caused a total of 8422 cases of SARS with 916 deaths in over 30 countries among five continents, with a crude fatality rate of around 11%.7 The outbreak had left a lasting impact not only in the lives of those who were infected, but also the frontline healthcare workers, public health officials, and even general public. To many, the slightest hint of the potential re-emergence of SARS would be the beginning of another nightmare. On 23 September 2012, less than a decade after the SARS pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported two cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia which bear significant reminisce with SARS (Table 1\n).8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Subsequent laboratory tests revealed a novel human coronavirus, the human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC).14, 15\n",

Firstly, HCoV-EMC may be similar to the seasonal human coronavirus HKU1 which was detected in less than 5% of samples from those with respiratory tract infections while 22%\u201359.2% of the general population is seropositive due to mild or asymptomatic infections in the past.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Even human coronavirus HKU1 was occasionally associated with mortality in those with underlying multiple co-morbidities who presented with acute community-acquired pneumonia.23 Therefore these two severe cases of HCoV-EMC may just represent the tip of an iceberg due to another previously unknown seasonal coronavirus. Secondly, it may be analogous to the situation of avian influenza H5N1 in which there are occasional transmissions of the virus from poultry to humans manifesting with severe disease and a mortality of over 50%.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 Thirdly, this is a rare instance of a few isolated zoonotic infections which are dead-ends. The fourth situation, the most dangerous one, is that this is the beginning of another SARS-like pandemic in which there will be increasing animal-to-human and subsequent human-to-human transmissions. When the suitable environmental conditions and opportunities for transmission associated with lapse in biosafety and infection control measures are present, the virus may cause an explosive outbreak as in the case of SARS. It would therefore be important to review the current knowledge on the clinical features, epidemiology, virology, and laboratory diagnosis of this novel coronavirus, and most importantly, to formulate possible treatment options and infection control measures based on comparisons made with other coronaviruses including SARS CoV.",

The genus betacoronavirus contains four groups. Group A contains human coronavirus OC43, which is associated with respiratory tract infections. Group B contains SARS-CoV, which is associated with severe pneumonia. HCoV-EMC belongs to the group C betacoronavirus. Group D betacoronavirus contains the Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9. Members of Coronaviridae are known causes of respiratory, intestinal, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity in humans and animals. Similar to other coronaviruses, HCoV-EMC is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of about 30 kb. It is classified as a group 2c coronavirus by previous nomenclature, and was named as such by the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, which was the first institution to sequence the viral genome. It is most closely related to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 found in the lesser bamboo bats (Tylonycteris pachypus) (Fig. 2\nA and B) and Japanese Pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus abramus) (Fig. 2C and D) respectively as shown in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A).38, 39 As expected, their genome arrangements are also similar to those of the members of group C betacoronavirus but different from other groups.40 The gene order from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 is Orf1ab containing the highly conserved polymerase and helicase genes, followed by the highly variable gene encoding Spike, five other accessory proteins, and then the more conserved Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein (Fig. 1B). The polymerase gene (RdRp) of HCoV-EMC has 90\u201392% amino acid identity with that of bat coronaviruses HKU4 or 5 while its spike gene (S) has only 64\u201367% amino acid identity with that of bat coronaviruses HKU4 or 5. The environmental stability of the virus is not known at this stage but might be important in determining its potential for further dissemination. In the case of SARS CoV, the virus had a higher degree of stability in the environment than other human coronaviruses, and could survive for at least two to three days on dry surfaces at room temperature and two to four days in stool.41, 42 Further studies should be conducted to obtain the key basic virological information including its life cycle and molecular evolution in order to understand its clinical and epidemiological significance.",

It is currently unknown whether the initial mild symptoms were caused by this novel virus, or related to another mild viral infection as no microbiological diagnosis was made. Of note, some friends of case 2 who travelled on the same trip also developed the initial mild symptoms, but all recovered without subsequent deterioration. It remains to be seen whether this novel coronavirus can cause mild infections especially as specific virological diagnostic tests are not performed routinely in most places.",

The only exception is SARS CoV which causes an acute community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration. Besides the presenting symptoms of fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, and nonproductive cough, clinical deteriorations typically occurred one week after the onset of symptoms in SARS and were usually accompanied by watery diarrhoea.5, 6, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53 Physical findings were indiscriminative from other causes of atypical pneumonia.

Acute renal failure with histological evidence of acute tubular necrosis was present in 6.9% of patients with SARS which is possibly due to hypoxic kidney damage,64 and was a poor prognostic factor.65 However, 28.8% of SARS patients' urine had viral load detectable by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) which correlated with abnormal urinalysis.66 It would be important to know the relative contribution of the direct HCoV-EMC induced cytolysis and the indirect pneumonia-related hypoxic damage to the severity of the renal pathology. In broiler chickens suffering from infection by the avian nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus, severe renal swelling and accumulation of urate in the tubules were commonly seen.67 Histological findings included lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis with characteristic tubular epithelial degeneration and sloughing. Minimal respiratory involvement was noted with this nephropathogenic coronavirus. Important differential causes of viral pneumonia with acute renal failure which should be considered when the initial sepsis work-up of a compatible case is unrevealing include hantaviruses, agents of viral haemorrhagic fever, and influenza viruses. Other extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS including lymphopenia, diarrhoea, hepatic dysfunction, diastolic cardiac impairment, pulmonary arterial thrombosis, bleeding diathesis, myositis, neuromuscular abnormalities, and epileptic fits should also be looked for in the two cases of HCoV-EMC infection.43, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74\n",

In elderly and young children with SARS, atypical presentation with the absence of fever and respiratory symptoms, and mild form of infection were occasionally reported.77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82 Furthermore, co-infection with other causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia may lead to a false sense of security when other agents of acute respiratory disease were found as in the case of SARS when co-infection by human metapneumovirus was reported in 12.5%\u201366.7% of such patients.53, 83 Therefore, applying the WHO interim case definitions in the investigation of patients without individualized risk assessment may lead to a significant proportion of patients with atypical presentation, mild disease, or co-infections being missed. In order to better understand the full spectrum of clinical features, to promptly provide the necessary treatment, and to apply the appropriate infection control measures to stop further dissemination of this novel coronavirus, a working algorithm with less stringent criteria for investigation in areas where resources are available can be considered (Fig. 3\n). In Hong Kong, we recommend to investigate patients based on an individualized risk assessment approach, in which immunocompetent adult patients who have travelled to or resided in an area where infection with HCoV-EMC has been reported, or who are close contact within the last 10 days before the onset of illness with a probable or confirmed case while the case was ill, and who present with fever and respiratory symptoms, should receive a baseline chest radiograph for assessment of lower respiratory tract involvement, urinalysis and renal function tests to detect renal impairment. In immunocompromised, elderly, and paediatric patients who may have atypical or mild forms of the infection, the decision for further investigations should be more liberal.",

The development of specific quantitative real-time RT-PCR, with a turnaround time of a few hours, is expected soon but the low number of cases will impede the validation of such tests. Taking the experience from SARS CoV diagnostics, two specific gene targets, namely the polymerase gene and the nucleoprotein gene, should be considered as they are both well conserved in coronaviruses and less subject to variation with different clinical strains.84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93 However the use of the accessory protein gene sequence upstream the Envelope gene (E) present only in HCoV-EMC was reported to be highly specific.14 The nucleoprotein gene has the theoretical advantage of being more sensitive as its subgenomic RNA copy number is more abundant in infected cells, but clinical studies with SARS CoV did not definitively prove this advantage. Since the timing of the peak viral load of HCoV-EMC has not been determined, repeating the test in suspected cases with an initial negative result is necessary to avoid a false-negative result because the viral load of SARS CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) peaked at day 10 of symptom onset.44, 84 Since the implications of a positive case are significant, positive test results from a single sample should be confirmed by a second test which detects a different region of the viral genome on the same sample in order to avoid false-positive results due to amplicon carryover.",

            "text": "The information on the epidemiology of infections associated with HCoV-EMC is mainly derived from the sequence of important events which is summarized in Table 1. The most important epidemiological linkage at present seems to be the travelling to or the residence in areas where the infection has been reported, namely Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in the preceding 10 days prior to the onset of illness. Case 2 had history of contact with camels and sheep.10 Given the close phylogenetic relationships between HCoV-EMC and the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 (Fig. 1A), our speculation is that wild animals including bat may serve as the natural reservoir of many group B or C betacoronaviruses which jump into one or more intermediate hosts of food or game animals dwelling closely to human as in the case of infection due to SARS CoV (civet), Hendra (horses), Nipah (swine), and Ebola (primates) viruses.99, 100 While pipistrelles, the natural reservoir of bat coronavirus HKU5, can be found in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, they are also seen in many other parts of the world. One possible reason why cases of infection associated with HCoV-EMC have not been reported in other areas may be explained by drawing an analogy to SARS CoV, whose transmission from the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sp.) to human was enhanced by intermediate animal hosts in palm civets and raccoon dogs. In Hong Kong, the regular surveillance of coronaviruses in patients' specimens or non-bat animal specimens in the past 5 years did not reveal a single case of infection by group C betacoronaviruses using consensus coronavirus primers and amplicon sequencing.101 This might be related to the absence of the necessary intermediate hosts for amplifying the novel virus in our locality and the high level of biosecurity measures adopted at our farms and markets. Further studies are required to prove these postulations concerning animal-to-human transmission.",

            "text": "In contrast to SARS, person-to-person transmission has so far not been observed in infections associated with HCoV-EMC. In case 2, no clinically apparent infection was seen in the healthcare workers and personnel of the medical escort company involved in the care and transfer of the patient from Qatar to the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the two confirmed cases were separated by three months temporally, and had no specific epidemiological linkage except for both having been in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia prior to the onset of illness. There have been no further cases reported which might signify the absence of ongoing transmission in the community. However, if the outbreak of severe respiratory illness that occurred in a Jordanian hospital in April 2012, which involved a total of 11 people with eight of them being healthcare workers and one fatal case, was subsequently confirmed to be associated with HCoV-EMC, then person-to-person transmission, and particularly nosocomial transmission, would be possible (Table 1). In the case of SARS, person-to-person transmission by direct or indirect contact of the mucosae with infectious respiratory droplets or fomites was considered to be the primary mode of spread, although airborne transmission under special circumstances has been reported.102 Nosocomial transmission, facilitated by the use of nebulizers, suction, intubation, bronchoscopy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, was also well documented.49, 103, 104 Importantly, unlike those with influenza, patients with SARS were most infectious on or after the fifth day after the onset of symptoms, and the viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions usually peaked on the tenth day.44 Therefore, if the novel virus was truly capable of causing person-to-person spread, the optimal infection control strategies might need to be further reviewed. As the Hajj is approaching, recommendations on whether travel restrictions or additional infection control measures are required are urgently needed. It would be disastrous if the phenomenon of super-spreading events observed in SARS was also encountered in infections associated with HCoV-EMC. An example was the large community outbreak that occurred in Amoy Garden of Hong Kong in which dried U traps of sewage drains facilitated the contaminated aerosols generated in toilets by exhaust fans to ascend the light well connecting different floors and resulted in a massive outbreak affecting hundreds of residents.105, 106\n",
