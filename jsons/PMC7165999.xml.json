Furthermore, the rapid expansion and large geographical extension of its transmission over a relatively short period are now affecting more than 180 countries, ramping up to more than 1,270,000 cases and over 69,000 reported deaths, [11\u201314] mainly in the highest populated regions of the world, including all largest cities in Latin America [15\u201317]. Then, we would like to present a summary of the pattern of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in Chile, comparing them with what is seen in other regions, and provide a hypothesis on its relationship with the genetic diversity of isolates.",

In Chile, where the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was identified on March 3, 2020, in the city of Talca, 315 km from the capital Santiago, a different pattern of clinical findings among rRT-PCR confirmed cases is being described. After the reporting of the index case and throughout March 23, 2020, 10,768 cases have been investigated, and 922 (4.7%) were positive [21]. Of these, 597 (64.8%) presented with headache as a cardinal symptom, while only 8.5% and 49.0% presented fever and cough, respectively, among other symptoms (Table 1) [21]. The presence of headache in the majority of these patients may suggest the potential neurotropism and neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 like seen for other naturally neurotropic human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 and -229E [22\u201325]. If so, recognition of headache within the clinical scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and the detailed description of its nuances and attributes within the timeline of infection is of utmost importance and an aspect deserving further investigations. Up to date, suspected case definition in Chile is still focused on fever, acute respiratory syndrome, and epidemiological nexus for testing purposes. Then, considering the findings in Europe and now in Chile, the case definition probably should be updated, considering neurological manifestations such as headache, anosmia, and dysgeusia [18].",

We know that previously, other epidemic emerging conditions, such as Zika, diverged into clinical differences and impact by its two lineages, African (ZIKVAF) and Asian (ZIKVAS) genotypes. In the type-I interferon receptor-deficient mouse model, ZIKVAF causes severe disease, whereas a much milder infection was seen after challenge with ZIKVAS [30]. Studies showed that there are strain-specific virulence differences between the African and Asian lineages in ZIKV mouse models [31]. Comparing the clinical findings between infected animals with different lineages of the viruses may help to understand the impact of genomic evolution and divergence and to surveillance by analyzing their sequences periodically. Currently, GISAID has analyzed in detail over 1300 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and classified the sequences in at least three relevant clades, S (containing 439 genomes), G (404), V (108), and other clades (424) [27]. S clade contains most of America\u2019s genomes. However, six of the Chilean isolates belong to the clade B and the Chile/Santiago-2/2020 to the clade A2a (Fig. 1), which maybe is related to the different clinical pattern observed in Chilean patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, only SARS-CoV-2 sequences from isolates of Brazil, Peru, and Chile are available from South America, in addition to Mexico and Panama for the rest of Latin America.",

Apparently, the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and its frequency decreased after early January 2020. The S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure [32]. In a recent study from Chile on the first four cases of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in Chile, authors suggest that at least two different viral variants entered into the country, from Europe and Asia [33].",

As this pandemic and other similar events have taught us in the past, a virus that spillover from animals to humans and reach adequate transmissibility can quickly spread with little pressure changes on its genome. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to also look into hosts\u2019 genomes for clues to explain these genomic divergences and its translation into the differing symptomatic presentation [34]. Furthermore, it will allow countries, especially in Latin America, to adopt new measures for epidemiological surveillance, testing, and clinical protocols. For Latin American countries, preparedness and response should be consistent with their states\u2019 capacities [15, 16].",
