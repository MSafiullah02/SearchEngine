Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs).",

However, a dysregulated, exuberant immune response in the later phases of the SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to hyper-inflammatory acute lung injury and ARDS. During the previous SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, immunopathological changes were documented to be involved in the genesis and progression of ARDS. 1 Generally, after pulmonary infection, alveolar macrophages secrete IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, and interferons. Then, as a response, the tissue resident cytotoxic T cells, Th1 cells and Th17 cells secrete further cytokines in increased quantity and diversity. These increased levels of cytokines not only increase the cytotoxic effects of T cells, but also act as a chemoattractant towards circulating monocytes and neutrophils. 3 The development of ARDS in response to infectious agents is rather non-specific, though the severity could vary with the specific circumstance. Experiments with mice using Influenza-A viruses demonstrated that very high viral doses induced extensive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These traps are a mechanism to trap and immobilize pathogens. It is plausible that high viral burden could hence lead to more extensive 'NETosis', thus leading to collateral damage and ultimately impairing gas exchange at the alveoli. 4 Given the high replicative potential of SARS-CoV-2, it is plausible that very high viral burden in the lung leads to a large inflammatory response, which could be fatal.",

At the opposite end of the spectrum, cells such as the regulatory T cells (Treg) and the M2-polarized macrophages are anti-inflammatory and regenerative. In conditions such as ARDS, it can be said that 'the balance has shifted overtly in favour of the pro-inflammatory'. 3, 5 Studies with patients infected with the SARS-CoV-1 had indeed demonstrated increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels among those who developed ARDS. 6, 7 Of the various T-helper (Th) subsets, the Tregs are special in that they are vital for maintaining self-tolerance. Tregs express CD4+CD25+FoxP3 and produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine namely IL-10. Evidence suggests that Tregs have an ability to downregulate TNF-alpha, IL-2 and IL-8. Thus, manipulation of T cell populations to enhance proportion of Tregs may possibly be a worthwhile exercise in the mitigation of acute lung injury. 8 Available evidence suggests that an increased Th17:Treg ratio is known to be proinflammatory and conducive to the development of ARDS. 8 In fact, the Th17/Treg ratio has been seen as a prognostic marker for ARDS in terms of mortality prediction. 9 Worthy of mention, the occasional manifestation of hemophagocytosis in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 serves as a testament to excessive macrophage activation, which can in turn be attributed to excessive proliferation and activation of T-Cells. 10 ",

It has also been well documented to have other roles as an immunomodulator in various auto-immune disorders with a reasonable toxicity profile. 13 Cyclophoshamide had revolutionized the scene of haplo-identical allogenic stem cell transplants (HaploSCT). HaploSCT essentially involves transplants from a donor who is 'not fully matched' to the recipient. The use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) has led to a dramatic reduction in likelihood of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and graft rejections. This is because PTCY works to eliminate rapidly proliferating alloreactive T-cells (in both directions) while preserving the slowly dividing regulatory-T cells (T-regs) and memory T cells. This not only leads to lesser likelihood of GVHD and graft rejection, but also leads to better immune tolerance and immune reconstitution. [14] [15] [16] Cyclophosphamide has a rich history of being used as an effective rescue therapy when other drugs failed in severe rheumatological disorders, which too have an immunological pathogenesis. This use has somewhat declined in the previous decade owing to the development of targeted monoclonal antibodies against specific cytokines. 13 If being considered as a preventive/mitigative strategy against ARDS in SARS-CoV-2, we need to ponder upon the ideal dose and the ideal timing of cyclophosphamide delivery.",

As an example, when cyclophosphamide is utilized as an immunomodulator in multiple sclerosis, the applied dose is many magnitudes less. 17 So, a 10-20 mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide could be able to demonstrate proof of concept.",

It could be possible that the use of cyclophosphamide could have prevented the particular patient from manifesting severe pulmonary symptoms. 18 If at all a strategy using cyclophosphamide is found effective in mitigating/preventing SARS-CoV-2 associated ARDS, it is plausible that it could be put into immediate global use. Unlike monoclonal antibodies the cost of cyclophosphamide is very much affordable. In addition, cyclophosphamide production can quickly be ramped up using existing pharmaceutical infrastructure, while manufacturing monoclonal antibodies on a large scale in a short time span could be problematic.",
