Standard RT-PCR and sequencing assembly methods in which genomic sequences are generated from the consensus of all aligned reads are not sufficient. To understand the depth of diversity in the population, next-generation sequencing (NGS), commonly referred to as deep sequencing is used. This process involves the parallel sequencing of genomic fragments, generating, depending on the protocol and sample preparation, thousands to millions of short sequencing reads in a single run which ultimately allows for greater coverage at each individual nucleotide.",

The following protocol describes the process of generating a high-quality RNA preparation from IBV grown in embryonated eggs, and then partially purified and concentrated through a 30 % sucrose cushion, which was suitable for use in 454 sequencing requiring a minimum quantity of 200 ng in 19 \u03bcl. The growth of IBV in embryonated eggs has been described previously and is not discussed in this protocol (see Chapter 10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_7 for further information). It is important to start this protocol with allantoic fluid containing IBV of high titer with 106\u2013107 pfu/ml preferable. The fluid must also be free of membrane or other solid masses and ideally be free from blood. If the IBV in question causes hemorrhaging of the blood vessels, it is important to harvest the allantoic fluid before this happens.",

The pellet should not be colored.Make sure the pellet is completely resuspended in the TRIzol reagent.This incubation step allows the TRIzol reagent to break down the virus particles.It is important to take the top aqueous layer only. The interface or organic layer, which will have a cloudy white appearance, contains DNA and protein. It is therefore best to be cautious when taking the top layer and is preferable to leave a little bit behind rather than risk contaminating the RNA sample.When precipitating RNA from small sample quantities RNase-free glycogen can be added at this stage. The glycogen will act as a carrier to the aqueous phase but will be co-precipitated with the RNA. It is important therefore to consider if this will have implications to downstream applications.It is highly unlikely that a pellet will be visible; a little bit of faith is required at this stage. It helps to position the tubes in the centrifuge so that the general location of the pellet can be estimated. It is prudent to keep the supernatant, and store on ice, until you are sure the RNA extraction has been successful.Keep the supernatant, and store on ice, until you are sure the RNA extraction has been successful.Do not allow the RNA to dry completely as the pellet can lose solubility.Make sure the pellet is completely dissolved (partially dissolved RNA samples have an A260/280 ratio <1.6) and then assess the quantity and quality using a NanoDrop or RiboGreen assay.\n",
