For REaL cloning, it was necessary to remove an XhoI site within the Hy3 gene of the PCR template by site-directed mutagenesis. Since both expression vectors had lost 23 bases of the mating factor signal peptide coding sequence as a result of the XhoI digestion, the Hy3 gene was PCR amplified with primers that added those 23 bases to the 5\u2032 end of the Hy3 coding sequence. For REaL cloning the PCR primers contained XhoI (5\u2032) and NotI (3\u2032) sites. The PCR primers also contained attB sequences for cloning by Gateway recombination into the donor vector pDonr223, i.e., the same PCR product was used for both REaL and Gateway cloning. Inserts and junctions of both types of clones were fully sequenced, then the insert of the Gateway entry clone was transferred into pDest-910 by in vitro recombination.

Both the REaL and Gateway Hy3 proteins were partially purified and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined. The upper and lower bands of the Gateway and REaL Hy3 proteins (Fig. 5) had the same sequences, NH2\u2013EAEACDL\u22ef, showing that while the Pichia homolog of Kex2 had cleaved at the expected site (Fig. 4), the Ste13 homolog did not. Inefficient Ste13 processing of the AMF signal peptide in Pichia is common (for example, see [5], [6]). Migration of IFNs as doublets on SDS\u2013PAGE is presumably due to disulfide bond formation, since extensive heating with reducing agent considerably diminished the doublets (our unpublished observations).",

The Gateway strain was more productive early in the run, but the REaL strain ended up secreting about as much protein. Comparison to the \u03b12c standard on both the SDS\u2013PAGE gel and the antibody dot blot suggested concentrations of secreted Hy3 protein of 100\u2013150 mg per liter. Since neither of these expression strains was selected for multiple copies of the expressed gene, we assume that each contains one copy per P. pastoris genome, the most common number.

They also had similar antiproliferative activities, approximately 2 ng/ml inhibited cell proliferation by 50%.",
