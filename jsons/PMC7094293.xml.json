From the epidemiological point of view, the main indicators generally used to describe the severity of these infection events in livestock are: (i) the total number of infected animals and farms during an epidemic, and (ii) the duration of the epidemic. The rationale behind these indicators is based on the evidence that epidemic surveillance and control costs are directly related to spatial and temporal extension of the epidemic events [6]. Furthermore, the effect of the epidemic duration on the socio-economic burdens associated to livestock diseases is larger than in human diseases. This is due to the sanitary restrictions imposed to farms in infected areas during ongoing outbreaks, such as animal movement and export bans. Moreover, the block or the restriction of farm activities can go over the time of infection, carrying on until the disease-free status is formally regained [7]. Examples of costly restrictions for the livestock industry include: the export ban of UK cattle because of the 1996 bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic [8] and the export ban of poultry and poultry related products in Hong Kong, Laos, Thailand, and The Netherlands due to outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza [9], [10], [11].",

            "text": "By using a stochastic modeling framework for classical swine fever in The Netherlands pig farms, Mangen et al. [12] showed that the increase of the epidemic duration affects the sanitary costs associated to disease outbreaks more than a proportional growth in the number of infected farms. This prediction followed from the observation that longer epidemics are more widespread, involving a larger number of animals slaughtered. The estimate of the epidemic duration appears almost invariably in the simulation outputs of data-driven mathematical models developed to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of surveillance and control policies for several infections in livestock, such as foot-and-mouth disease [13], classical swine fever [14], bovine tuberculosis [15], and avian influenza [16]. However, few attempts have been made to address the problem of minimizing the epidemic duration from a theoretical point of view by using optimal control theory. To our knowledge, the only example of analytic characterization of the control function in a time-optimal framework is due to Jiang [17], who focused on the analysis of isolation strategies in a subsystem of the model proposed in Zhang et al. [18] to describe SARS spread. On the other hand, the optimal control theory has been widely applied to solve the problem of minimizing the total number of infected individuals (or the total infectious burden) in basic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic models by means of different control policies, such as: the implementation of emergency prophylactic vaccination plans, the isolation of infected individuals, the reduction of disease transmission through the limitation of contacts between individuals, and non-selective culling [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25].",

Isolation consists in the quarantine of infected individuals. As regards livestock diseases, in SIR models isolation is mathematically equivalent to removal of infected individuals through test-and-cull procedures. Non-selective culling consists in the slaughtering of both infected and healthy individuals and it is usually implemented in wildlife and livestock when no other options are available (e.g. no diagnostic tests available, lack of time or resources). The rationale for culling healthy individuals resides in the positive relationship between the rate at which individuals become infected and the abundance of susceptible individuals. Among humans, the reduction of transmission can be obtained through information campaigns or emergency movement bans (e.g. school closures, flight limitations), while in livestock it can be obtained by imposing limitations on animal, vehicle, and personnel movements among farms.",

In this study, we will show that the optimal control strategies to minimize the epidemic duration in SIR models can substantially differ from those minimizing the infectious burden. Specifically, we will prove that: (i) using the maximum control for the entire epidemic duration may not be the optimal strategy (even in unconstrained conditions); and (ii) when the maximum control for the entire epidemic is not an optimal strategy, a delayed control is optimal.

However, since our problem is characterized by the particular class of optimal controls A in (9), for our numerical simulations we will use a simpler ad hoc numerical scheme. The method is based on the idea of identifying each bang-bang function u(t)\u2208A with a real parameter. Since the delayed optimal control function is not defined at the switching time instant, for numerical simulations we fix by convention u*(\u03c4s*)=umax.

Specifically, we characterized analytically the time-optimal control strategies for prophylactic vaccination, isolation, non-selective culling, and reduction of transmission by using a family of simple SIR models in an optimal control framework [26]. Our analyses led to the non-trivial result that, even in the unconstrained optimal control problem (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), using the maximal effort for the entire epidemic period may not be the optimal strategy to minimize the epidemic duration. In addition, we found that, when applying the maximal effort for the entire epidemic is sub-optimal, then a delayed control represents the optimal strategy in all the cases investigated. We even found that the optimal amount of delay applied to the control may be sufficiently large to postpone the beginning of the intervention after the peak of the infection (see Fig. 1 and dark gray regions in Figs. 3(a), 4(a), and 5(a)). In addition, we showed that the delayed control may represent the optimal strategy for minimizing the epidemic duration even when a prompt intervention could immediately reduce the number of infected individuals (i.e. reduce RC below 1, see Figs. 3(c) and 5(c)).",

In other words, reducing via external interventions the number of individuals involved in the infection process at the beginning of the outbreak (especially the infected ones) may lead to slower epidemic dynamics, which implies longer times for the epidemic to go extinct. Two evidences support this explanation: (1) delayed control is generally optimal when the effectiveness of the control is low (i.e. low u\nmax ); and (2) isolation and reduction of transmission policies (which do not reduce directly the number of susceptibles) tend to select for delayed control in wider ranges of parameter settings than vaccination and culling.",

Some examples of the tension between minimizing the epidemic duration and the infectious burden can be observed in Figs. 3 and 5. In particular, Figs. 3(c) and 5(c) display the eradication time, T, and Figs. 3(d) and 5(d) display the number of susceptible individuals at the end of the epidemic, S(T), as functions of u\nmax  for both the time-optimal control and the constant control (corresponding to the optimal solution for the unconstrained problem of infectious burden minimization). From these figures, we notice that the different objective functions provide similar results when the control efforts are sufficiently large to rapidly lead the epidemic to extinction (high u\nmax ), while they provide substantially different results in the case of less efficient strategies (low u\nmax ). Specifically, the time-optimal control strategy performs poorly in minimizing the infectious burden at the boundary between delayed and constant control (see Figs. 3(d) and 5(d)), while the infectious burden minimization strategy performs poorly in minimizing the epidemic duration for slightly higher values of RC (see the peak of T\u03c4=0 in Figs. 3(c) and 5(c)).",

On the other hand, they found that the number of infected farms always increases when the vaccination is delayed [see table 4 in 13].

This is especially true in the case of isolation and reduction of transmission, where the eradication time may increase from two- to five-fold with respect to the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d alternative (see Figs. 3(c) and 5(c)). Similar negative effects of constant efforts on disease control have also been highlighted when the target of the intervention was the reduction of the number of infected individuals [38], [39], [40], [41]. All these counter-intuitive findings suggest that the implementation of simple time-dependent strategies may crucially improve the control of infectious diseases.",
