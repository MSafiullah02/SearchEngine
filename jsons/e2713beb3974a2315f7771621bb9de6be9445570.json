In fact, although it is true that more than 15 virus families have been identified in 200 species of 12 bat families and that they are more likely to be infected with more zoonotic viruses than rodents (O'Shea et al. 2014) , studies have shown no evidence that a decrease in bat density would reduce viral prevalence (Plowright et al. 2015) . Instead, they found that disrupting bat colonies and increasing bat stress may increase the amplitude of viral shedding. (Halpin et al. 2011) . In one study, Pteropus bats from Australia and Malaysia were inoculated with NiV and HeV by natural routes of infection. In spite of intensive sampling, researchers found no NiV in Malaysian bats, and HeV was reisolated from only one Australian bat. These results suggest opportunities for henipavirus transmission may be limited and that the probability of spillover is low (Halpin et al. 2011) .",

Simple things like vaccinating and fencing horses away from fruit-bearing trees where bats may roost and feed could decrease exposure to HeV (Plowright et al. 2015) . Changing agricultural practices by the creation of buffer zones between fruiting trees and domestic animals would decrease the incidence of NiV and HeV (Smith and Wang 2013) . In Bangladesh, the installation of barriers on the date palms that prevent the bats from accessing the collection vessels is a simple strategy currently being investigated to control transmission of NiV (Smith and Wang 2013) . Not only is wanton destruction of bat populations unfeasible, it is also ill advised. Bats have remarkable immune systems, and we need to study them. \"The bat immune system is astonishingly tolerant of most pathogens-a trait that could pose risks to people, but that also offers clues to preventing human disease of aging, including cancer\" (Angier 2015; Baker 2014) .

            "text": "What sets bats apart from other mammals is their ability to fly. Flight results in a 15-fold to 16-fold increase in bat metabolic rate in comparison with the sevenfold increase in rodents running to exhaustion or the twofold increase in metabolic rate of most flying birds (O'Shea et al. 2014) . Bats use 20 times more energy than other mammals of the same size during an average day (Slezak 2012) . The body temperature is consistently above normal in a fever-like state. This persistent fever state keeps viral replication at a low level, and the virus never overruns the bat immune system (Grant 2014) . But all this energy production generates free radicals that damage DNA. In spite of that bats, are extremely long lived, some living up to 40 years of age. They live 3 to 10 times longer than other mammals of similar size (Grant 2014) and demonstrate low levels of cancer . Bats have evolved a strategy to avoid DNA damage (Lyn 2013; Slezak 2012) . Scientists looked at the fruit bat Pteropus alecto and the insectivorous bat Myotis davidii and found a concentration of genes in the DNA damage checkpoint (Zhang et al. 2013 ). They also found bats were missing a gene segment known to trigger extreme and potentially fatal cytokine storms (Lyn 2013) , leading scientists to speculate that if we can manipulate the human immune response to be more like a bat immune response, we may have a better chance of surviving diseases that bats are immune to (Slezak 2012) . Instead of characterizing bats as \"pathogen ferries on wings\" (Grant 2014) , we need to study them. We need to develop bat cell culture assays and bat-specific reagents to examine lymphocyte proliferation, antibody and cytokine synthesis, cell-mediated immune responses, and a host of other immunologic functions in bats that make them important reservoirs of emerging viruses (Calisher et al. 2006) . We don't need batricide. We need intensified wildlife research.",

            "text": "In the fall of 1999, the accepted dogma was that WNV was only transmitted through the bite of a mosquito. However, WNV-positive birds had dramatic enteric pathology and demonstrated abundant viral antigen on IHC staining of intestine and kidney, which suggests they were shedding large volumes of virus into the environment. This raised the question of whether alternative modes of transmission could be involved in the epidemiology of WNV. Aerosol transmission had been known to occur with WNV in a laboratory setting. If WNV-positive flamingoes were shedding virus into their pond, could other flamingoes be getting infected via ingestion of the virus via the fecal-oral route or were they being exposed via aerosol? There was also abundant viral antigen in ovarian and testicular tissue, which suggested vertical transmission was also a possibility. However, there was no federal or state funding available to do the necessary transmission studies. Ultimately, the Bronx Zoo, in a first-of-its-kind publicprivate partnership, donated $25,000 to the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, which had the necessary BL-3 level biosecurity to run the experimental studies. These studies confirmed that birds were acquiring WNV via aerosol as well as via the fecal-oral route (Komar et al. 2002) , which had direct impact on how zoos handled suspect cases. This finding ultimately led to the creation of a rapid diagnostic test using oral and cloacal swabs that was adopted by many health departments (Komar et al. 2002; Stone et al. 2004) . By 2002, patients had acquired WNV via transfusions and organ transplants (Charatan 2002; Cushing et al. 2004) , babies had been born with WNV or became infected through breastfeeding (CDC 2002) , and alternative modes of transmission were formally recognized in humans.",

            "text": "Another concern raised by the animal studies was the level of viremias in infected birds. WNV IHC indicated birds were \"hot\" in Department of Defense terminology. There was concern the birds could present a health risk to animal handlers. Veterinarians and wildlife rehabilitators treating and housing neurologic crows and raptors might be getting exposed to large volumes of virus. But it was generally assumed the viremias with this new strain of WNV would be low, like those that occur with St. Louis encephalitis. When viremia studies were performed, the results were astonishing, and they prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to announce its plans to do occupational hazard studies on veterinarians and bird handlers. In Smithsonian magazine, Dr. Thomas Monath, virologist extraordinaire, said, \"I couldn't believe the incredible viremias these birds cook up . . . there's no precedent for it. There were from a trillion to ten trillion viral particles per milliter of blood. That's beyond no precedent. That's almost beyond belief. No self-respecting bird can gin up a viremia higher than 100,000 particles with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus. So some birds are almost a billion-fold more infectious with West Nile than with SLE\" (Hall 2003) . Basic histopathology and IHC offered another preview into human pathology. One of the zoos' bird mortalities had demonstrated pathology and IHC staining of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord consistent with poliomyelitis. The first human patients had presented with profound muscle paralysis that had not fit with the initial diagnosis of SLE. Poliomyelitis in patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease was first published in 2002 (Glass et al. 2002) , but animal studies suggested its possibility in August 1999.",

            "text": "Many of the neurologic issues that later emerged as concerns in human patients were first seen in veterinary pathology studies. One of the more sobering and prescient histopathologic findings in zoo animals was the presence of ongoing inflammation of the brain weeks to months after initial infection with WNV. In 1999, WNV was believed to cause a mild febrile self-limiting illness in the majority of patients, with a small percentage developing neuroinvasive disease. However, a 1983 Russian publication (Pogodina et al. 1983 ) on primates inoculated with a number of strains of WNV found all were capable of producing long-term neurologic sequelae and viral persistence regardless of neurologic status of the animals. Was WNV-99 really self-limiting? What did the primate studies mean for us? With this in mind, pathologists at the Bronx Zoo intensively evaluated the brains of all known seropositive animals regardless of their clinical signs at the time of infection. Evaluation of a snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and a Greater Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) that died 3 and 8 months after infection showed dramatic lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffing. An asymptomatic babirousa (Babyrousa babyrussa) died 10 months after seroconversion and also had evidence of ongoing inflammation, which suggested even subclinical infections might result in long-term central nervous system pathology and possible viral persistence. In 2004, it was recognized that WNV infection could result in a protracted convalescent period with long-term problems with memory, confusion, clinical depression, muscle weakness, tremors (Carson et al. 2006; Hall et al. 2008; Hughes et al. 2007; Klee et al. 2004; Sejvar 2007) , and Parkinsonian-like disorders (Hughes et al. 2007 ) 18 months after infection. Sixty percent of encephalitic patients in a Houston study reported symptoms 5 years after infection (Voelker 2008) . Patients with milder forms of illness are just as likely to suffer long-term health problems as encephalitis cases. Eighty-four percent of patients in a study on West Nile fever reported persistent fatigue, 59% had memory problems, and 49% had ongoing muscle weakness (Carson et al. 2006) . It wasn't until 2006 that WNV was found in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of a human patient 4 months after initial diagnosis (Penn et al. 2006) . The hamster was established as a model for West Nile encephalitis in 2001 (Xiao et al. 2001 ). It was not until 2010 that a murine model of viral persistence was established (Appler et al. 2010) . It showed that WNV persisted in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues for up to six months after infection in mice with subclinical infections. What does this mean for the estimated 1.2 million people with asymptomatic WNV infections in the United States and possible subclinical disease? Ironically, in 2005, a hamster study on WNV persistence found virus was shed in the urine up to 8 months after infection (Tesh et al. 2005) , which shifted the focus back to the impact of WNV on the kidney. Viral RNA was detected in the urine of an encephalitic patient 8 days after symptom onset in 2005 (Tonry et al. 2005) . A 2012 long-term study of patients in Houston found an association between neuroinvasive infection and the development of chronic kidney disease (Nolan et al. 2012) . We may be seeing the tip of an iceberg in terms of long-term sequelae of WNV.",

EPT draws upon expertise from all health sectors in the hope that we may be able to detect zoonotic health threats prior to spillover into the human population. The predict portion of the project includes the University of California-Davis veterinary school, the Smithsonian Institution, and nongovernmental organizations such as Ecohealth Alliance and the Wildlife Conservation Society, which represent wildlife and ecosystem health.
