Ironically, the coronavirus succeeded in making it happen. Working in the second most densely infected country, as a father of two little kids and a junior group leader, I would not say that lockdown life is easy. With our lab closed, I can only focus on the papers, reports and other writing work, and communications with students can only be done online. What is more complicated is that I have to shift my working time mainly to the night, so that I can have \"bulk time\" to concentrate on one thing. Although with less productivity, fortunately I have more time to teach my daughter mathematics, read story books for my son, make handicrafts with them, and have other fun. This greatly eases my anxiety due to the suspended research, which makes my lockdown life better than expected.",

A typical example is the big debate on whether uninfected people should wear masks. Since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, Chinese and other Asians have become very sensitive to unknown viruses, and wearing masks has been considered as an effective method to prevent the spread. However, this is treated as a sign of sickness and overreaction for most Europeans, and is thus not socially acceptable. Three weeks ago, when I wore my first mask just before the lockdown of ETH, I only saw Asian people wearing masks in Switzerland. Surprisingly, along with the situation of COVID19 getting worse, I start to see Europeans wearing masks in the stores and on the street. I even read the news that Austrians are required to wear masks in supermarkets. It is interesting to see this transformation due to the reconciliation between Eastern and Western culture, and I will continuously follow this trend during this special period.",

As a young postdoctoral scientist, I must admit it is quite harsh not only sacrificing laboratory time but also socializing only remotely. It is even more frustrating when this crisis put an instantaneous halt to promising ongoing experiments. This bizarre and heavy atmosphere is even more present in that I became, partly against my will, a troglodyte in my small Parisian apartment. While lots of my friends and colleagues returned home to spend more time with their families at the beginning of the crisis, a mixture of logic and reflection advised me to stay home for the greater good, despite my family's call to come back. Although, being organized and rigorous, COVID-19 is putting a strain on me mentally as remaining focused upon writing ongoing articles and reviews all day is really demanding with all the other distractions surrounding me. Physically, it has considerably reduced my daily physical activity to the point where the most exercise I get is the few walking steps needed to move around my flat. Although, I sincerely hope this horrific time will end soon, and we will learn lessons for future preparedness, I definitely believe that we can take advantage of it to grow mentally and learn new things.",

Nonetheless, the pandemic materialized as a storm when, from one day to the other, we had to shut down the laboratory and stop all nonessential experiments. After the initial phase of disorientation, the first work-related thoughts went to the teaching, the graduate students and their projects. While for undergraduate classes the Universite\u0301de Montre\u00e1l rapidly reacted and provided support to generate online classes, for the research, the initial stress slowly converted in the recognition that this could be a great opportunity to review and better plan our projects. Now, after a month of the home-office, I feel that this forced shutdown brought me out of a working routine, and made me appreciate even more the importance of our profession. Scientific research is the only actual weapon we have to fight this infection and to prevent or give a rapid response to future ones. Deeply, I hope this pandemic will teach us all something, and that the opinions of scientists will receive higher consideration by the society and the decisionmaking institutions.",

My return flight to the US was on January 31st, which turned out to be United Airline's last flight from China to the US. After a two-week self-quarantine, I worked hard in the lab and tried to get as many results as possible, since I realized that universities in the US could also be shut down in the near future, which happened one month later. Now, I have been staying in my apartment for three weeks\ue0d5 I work on manuscripts, read papers, think about proposals, do \"reactions\" in the kitchen, and watch TV.

I've been keeping a routine, but have found that keeping a flexible routine with some goals works better for me. Some of those goals include: sit down at my desk and get some writing done, read some literature, do yoga, make meals, check on my parents. I find that variation in my routine helps with maintaining sanity\ue0d5if I stray from a rigid routine, I start to create more inner turmoil when I cannot keep up. However, if I just try to set some daily/weekly goals, I can tackle them based on how I'm feeling that particular day. Try to practice yoga at least 4 times a week; some days it happens in the morning, some days in the evening, some days not at all. Write for at least one hour a day; some days that happens all at once, some days it is broken up into shorter sessions. I feel I'm in a precarious position as I'm wrapping up my postdoctoral work and gearing up to begin my independent career, but all I can do for now is take it one day at a time. Our laboratories closed unofficially on March 13th, 2020, as I worried about the health of my students and postdocs. It coincided with spring break and some students were traveling abroad to see their families. I was hesitant to advise them on travel and the Institute had not officially closed, making it difficult to issue strong recommendations. Georgia Tech officially closed all nonessential activities one week later. The weeks after were tough, as students got stranded abroad and experiments were not finished to the extent we wanted. Our laboratories only opened in October 2019, and we spent the past 6 months ramping up. It took one day to ramp everything down. Nonetheless, this has presented itself as an opportunity to come up with strong experimental plans, revisit the literature, and compile and analyze data that will be going into future manuscripts. The week of April 6, 2020, finally started feeling normal and we are trying to make the most of it. I have a plan for each of my students and postdocs for the next two months, after that, I will have to reevaluate! Will we turn into a computational group? We will see! As for teaching, transitioning to online format for this millennial (me) was easy and my students adapted quite well\ue0d5they ask more questions than ever.",

Since then, we have been working around the clock to build covidscholar.org, a knowledge portal designed to help researchers stay on top of the COVID-19 literature. To our knowledge, our database is the most comprehensive and current source for COVID-19 papers available today with more than 45,000 papers and we are expanding to include patents and clinical trials in the near future. Our site also includes features that leverage machine learning models that extract knowledge from the literature and help researchers make new connections that they might have missed due to the sheer volume of research coming out every day (we are seeing more than 150 papers published on COVID-19 daily.) This project has been extremely motivating for everyone on the team and we have been able to make rapid progress as a result.",

Our data were backed up, and some of us even took our workstations home. Indeed, working from home has several advantages. I get to spend more time with my family who lives in a different state, and eliminate daily commutes. To keep the research momentum going, our group holds the research meetings twice a week online. Additionally, I try to maintain my usual routines, such as work hours and breaks, and attend online seminars whenever possible.

Many conferences have been canceled or postponed to next year, but on the other hand, online conferences became increasingly popular. I have already received several invitations for online Ph.D. defenses, which is critical for our young people to progress. Web-based conferences can significantly save time, and may become more and more popular even after the pandemic.",

I stayed at my parents' home with my family for more than two months, wondering about the fates of my entire family. The virus infected several of my relatives, four of whom were hospitalized. Luckily, they all recovered, except my 99-year-old grandfather. During the most dire of days, like the people of Wuhan, I could not sleep in the night and was looking for the slightest hope in the news, while planning to limit exposure of uninfected family members. With strong backup from the Chinese people, especially medical personnel, Wuhan survived and reopened on 8th of April. I returned to Shanghai by flight on the first day Wuhan reopened, and was greeted by media instead of medical teams upon arrival.",

I sincerely cannot anticipate the outcome, had I wrote to the editor explaining that we could not provide any further experimental data in the near future due to the coronavirus outbreak, or if I were to ask for an unlimited extension of time to revise. As of now, we still do not have a schedule to reopen the laboratories. I am still waiting for another 14 days upon arrival in Shanghai before the university can clear me to return to campus.",
