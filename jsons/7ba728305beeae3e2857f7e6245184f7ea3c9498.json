            "text": "PURPOSE: Acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is characterized by sudden onset, painless, and massive hemorrhage from rectal ulcer(s) in patients with serious underlying illnesses. It is a matter of controversy whether acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a distinct clinical entity. This is the first Asian report on acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome to be made outside Japan. METHODS: From January 1989 to December 1999, 8,085 patients underwent total colonoscopy at our institution. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and colonoscopic files. The diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome was made by means of the clinical, histologic, and colonoscopic findings. RESULTS: Among the 8,085 patients, 19 patients (11 males; mean age, 71.2 \u00b1 10.1 years) were diagnosed with acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome, which accounted for 2.8 percent of the patients with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The duration from hospitalization to the onset of massive bleeding ranged from 3 to 14 (mean, 9 \u00b1 3.3) days. Characteristics of colonoscopic appearance were solitary or multiple rectal ulcer(s), with round, circumferential, geographical, or Dieulafoy-like lesions located within a mean of 4.7 cm \u00b1 1.5 cm from the dentate line. Histopathologically, the lesions appeared as necrosis with denudation of covering epithelium, hemorrhage, and multiple thrombi in the vessels of the mucosa and underlying stroma, which is considered to be similar to stress-related mucosa injury. Successful hemostasis was obtained in 74 percent (14/19) of patients with direct therapeutic maneuvers. Prognosis was largely dependent on accurate diagnosis and management of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSIONS: We assert that acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a rare but important entity and stress that awareness of this clinical entity should lead to a high index of suspicion resulting in early detection, diagnosis, and appropriate therapy. [Key words: Acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome; Rectal bleeding; Rectum; Critical illness; Rectal ulcer] I n 1974, Delancy and Hitch 1 first described three cases of acute, asymptomatic, and life-threatening hemorrhage from solitary ulcers of the rectum. In 1981, Soeno et al. 2 used the term \"acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer\" (AHRU) to describe such cases. At approximately the same time, Duff and Wright 3 reported seven cases of \"acute bleeding rectal ulcer\" with similar presentations. In 1993, Fujimaki et al. 4 considered AHRU as a syndrome. Clinically, such lesions were characterized by sudden onset, painless, massive hemorrhage from solitary or multiple rectal ulcer(s) in patients with serious underlying illnesses. The lesions usually lie 3 to 10 cm above the dentate line, and their pathogenesis is largely unknown.",

Medical records and colonoscopic files were then carefully reviewed. Those patients who fulfilled all of the following criteria were considered to have AHRUS and included into this study: 1) sudden onset of painless, massive rectal bleeding, which was defined as: hemoglobin < 10 g/dl with shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg and/or pulse rate > 110/min) or hemoglobin < 7 g/dl; 2) serious underlying disorders; 3) presence of ulcerations with ongoing bleeding or stigmata of recent bleeding in the rectum, as confirmed by colonoscopy; 4) sources of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract were excluded by esophagogastroduodenoscopy; 5) stool cultures and cultures of biopsy specimens from the margins of these ulcers were negative; and 6) no history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration within one month before the bleeding episode. We analyzed clinical features, colonoscopic findings, treatment, and outcome of the patients. The histologic slides of biopsy specimens were reviewed by one of the authors (K-BT), an independent and experienced pathologist. Table 1 . Time elapsed from hospitalization for underlying disorders to the onset of massive bleeding ranged from 3 to 14 (mean, 9 \u00b1 3.3) days. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and required massive amounts of blood transfusion to maintain hemodynamic stabilization. The mean amount of blood transfusion was 3,723 ml \u00b1 2,094 ml (range, 1,200-8,000 ml). These patients had normal bowel habits (\u0545 3 times/day and \u0546 3 times/week) or diarrhea (>3 times/day and stool weight >200 g/day).",

These lesions were located within a mean of 4.7 (range, 1-7) cm from the dentate line. For the acute nature of the ulceration, without significant changes on surrounding mucosa, and their close to the anal verge in location, the rectal ulcers of AHRUS can be easily overlooked during the emergent or elective anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy by physicians who are not familiar with this special disease entity, which happened to five patients (Patients 1, 5, 7, 8, and 10). Therefore, high index of suspicion with retroflex inspection of distal end of rectal ampulla during colonofiberscopic examination (Fig. 1) are invariably required for the identification of these distal rectal ulcers. After the diagnosis of first case in 1989, only three additional cases were identified in the following five years (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) .

These findings are identical to those of hemorrhagic necrosis of gastrointestinal tract in patients with cardiovascular dysfunction, shock, or sepsis at autopsy. 7 Therefore, we concur that the pathogenesis of AHRUS may lie in a stress-induced disturbance of the circulation in the small intramural vessels, caused by secretion of catecholamines or vasoconstrictive gastrointestinal polypeptides as suggested by Ming. 7 It has been well documented that severe physiologic stress (e.g., caused by major trauma, sepsis, head injury, burns, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, and multiple organ failure) often is associated with mucosa injury of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract [8] [9] [10] ; however, compared with the higher prevalence of mucosa injury of the UGI tract, stress-related mucosa disease of the colon and rectum is relatively uncommon. For patients with stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding, the source of bleeding was found to originate from rectal lesion in 1.2 to 6.7 percent at autopsy. 7, 11 In the past decade, traditional interventions for patients with unidentified sources of rectal bleeding have been urgent visceral angiography or emergent surgery. 12 However, AHRUS patients treated using these approaches have had a high rate of mortality and renewed bleeding. 13, 14 Because angiography may not be useful but may be hazardous because of delay in controlling the bleeding and surgery with colectomy, as performed for angiodysplasia or diverticular disease, is useless in this situation. On the other hand, hemostasis was obtained in 74 percent (14/19) of patients, by means of direct therapeutic maneuvers such as cauterization, local injection, or suture ligation. Therefore, prognosis of AHRUS was primarily dependent on accurate diagnosis and management of the underlying disorders.",

[26] [27] [28] SRUS often occurs in young adults with a previous history of constipation, self-digitation, or rectal prolapse. 29 The histologic features of SRUS are not found in AHRUS. 17, 18, 30 In stercoral ulcer, chronic constipation always precedes the occurrence of the disease, and sometimes residual solid fecal mass can be found adhering to the margin of the ulcer, 20,31-34 whereas none of our patients had a history of constipation. Patients with acute ischemic procitis often have clearly identifiable precipitating factors such as aortoiliac operations or shock, and suffer from abdominal pains. 35, 36 Lesions are most commonly involved with segmental erythema and edema, with or without ulceration. In AHRUS, however, the surrounding mucosa of the rectal ulcers was either normal or only slightly hyperemic. Radiation, NSAID-induced, or trauma-induced rectal ulcers can be readily distinguished from AHRUS by a negative history of pelvic radiotherapy, NSAID use (oral or suppository form), and trauma (enema, catharsis use, and foreign objects insertion). It may be difficult to make a differential diagnosis between infectious rectal ulcers and AHRUS; however, the culture results of stool and biopsy specimens of our patients were all negative, and no typical nuclear inclusion bodies of biopsy specimens could be found, as is true in cases of rectal ulcers induced by herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus. 23,37-39",

            "text": "To the Editor-Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding is relatively uncommon and accounts for 1.5 percent of all surgical emergencies. 1 Bleeding is usually selflimiting rather than ongoing. In western countries, the commonest causes are angiodysplasia, diverticular disease, neoplasms, and internal hemorrhoids. There are many other less frequent and rare causes, including solitary rectal ulcer syndrome 2 and Dieulafoy-like lesions. 3, 4 Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome has characteristic histologic criteria: namely, the presence of fibrous obliteration of the lamina propria with disorientation of the lamina propria with disorientation of the muscularis mucosae and extension of smooth muscle fibers into the lamina propria. 5 Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome causes massive lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage generally in seriously ill patients. 6, 7 In this issue of the Journal, Tseng and colleagues from Taiwan reported 19 cases of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome that were histologically distinct from solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. The term \"acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer\" was first introduced by our Japanese colleagues in Japanese literature 8, 9 but a clear clinicopathologic distinction from solitary rectal ulcer syndrome has not been made. In the study by Tseng et al., histology was retrospectively reviewed from margins of the rectal ulcers from 14 of 19 pa-tients. The authors described necrosis with denudation of covering epithelium, hemorrhage, and multiple thrombi in the vessels of the mucosa and underlying stroma, without any of the characteristic features of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. To add to the confusion, the authors described Dieulafoy-like lesions through erosion in otherwise normal surrounding mucosa in two patients. Of interest, both patients had biopsies taken that revealed identical histologic features as patients with clear-cut ulcers. Histologic diagnosis of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can be difficult.",

            "text": "To the Editor-Benign ulcerative diseases of the rectum are unusual disorders with diverse causes and varied clinical behavior. According to the literature, these benign lesions typically behave as a chronic inflammatory disease with variable endoscopic features, including local proctitis, frank ulceration, and polypoid mass; however, characteristic histologic changes are as follows: fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria, hypertrophy of muscularis mucosae, displacement of glands and small cysts into the submucosa, erosion of the mucosa. 1 To our knowledge, most of the information on this disease entity comes from studies in western countries. Researchers in western countries termed these benign rectal ulcerations \"solitary rectal ulcers\" and the corresponding disease entity \"solitary rectal ulcers.\" Most commonly, these ulcers affected young adults who had chronic constipation and straining defecation. The major problems are long-standing bowel disturbance and rectal bleeding. The intensity of bleeding is usually mild, and rectal bleeding requiring transfusion has rarely been reported. Cases of severe bleeding from a solitary rectal ulcer has been respectively reported by Delancy and Hitch 2 and Haycock et al. 3 ; however, no typical histologic appearance was seen. We suggest that the case reported by Delancy and Hitch were clinically similar to our presenting cases of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcers, whereas the case reported by Hancock et al. was an ulcer produced by pressure necrosis from a pelvic tumor and was pathophysiologically similar to the stercoral ulcer of rectum.",

Suggested causes include chronic constipation, excessive straining at defecation, spastic pelvic floor syndrome, rectal prolapse, and psychologic factors. It seems likely these benign chronic inflammatory diseases were produced by the repeated traumatic injury on the prolapsing rectal mucosa during the digital evacuation and straining at defecation. 4 It is noteworthy that in certain conditions such as severe sepsis, acute cerebral vascular diseases, endstage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, advanced liver cirrhosis, and advanced malignancy, etc., these benign lesions can be associated with an acute inflammatory disease, endoscopically acute bleeding ulceration, and pathologically nonspecific inflammatory change. Most information on this clinical entity comes from the work of Japanese investigators who termed these benign lesions \"acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer \" and the corresponding disease entity \"acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcers syndrome.\" In western countries, there have been no reports of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer; however, there have been two case-series reports on diseases similar to acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer. 5, 6 In contrast to their chronic counterparts, these benign acute bleeding rectal ulcers mainly affected aged patients who had significant comorbidity conditions. The major problem is life-threatening hemorrhage, which can pose an added risk of fatal sequelae to previously severely ill victims.",

Kanwai et al. 6 reported that rectal trauma, fecal impaction, ischemia, rectal prolapse, and idiopathy are the possible causes of benign bleeding rectal ulcers. We presumed that the 7 cases of acute bleeding rectal ulcers reported by Duff et al. and the 11 cases of idiopathic cause of bleeding rectal ulcers reported by Kanwai et al. were clinically similar to our reported series. From the viewpoint of demography, clinical characteristics, and colonoscopic findings, we suppose that both acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer and benign acute bleeding rectal ulcer were essentially a similar clinical entity and quite different from solitary rectal ulcer. We advocate the thesis of Fujimaki et al. 7 that acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer should be regarded as a syndrome caused by various factors. We also agree with Tjandra et al. 1 that further close examination on the colonoscopy, histology, and clinical characteristics of each patient is necessary to identify the real entity of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer.",
