            "text": "The problem of modeling how epidemics spread among individuals has been extensively studied by people from various fields for many years. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In the field of physics, most approaches to these problems are related to the theory of phase transition, statistical physics, and critical phenomenon. 6 networks has provided new grounds to the understanding of epidemic dynamics for physicists. 11, 12 They proposed various models, such as the classical susceptible-infectedsusceptible model (SIS), 13 susceptible-infected-recovery model (SIR), 14 and so on, 15, 16 to shed light on modeling the epidemic dynamics. Different models have addressed the problem from different perspectives, e.g., the frequency of contacts between people, 17 duration of the disease, 18 and risk perception. 19 Furthermore, in network modeling of a single layer topology structure, the standard approach assumes that all links have the same activation time, which is clearly an abstraction of any real topology structure and cannot reveal the true relationships in the complex system very well. 20 Therefore, as a natural way to describe the interrelated complex connections among individuals, the multiplex network is gaining more and more attention. It can overcome the drawbacks of the simplex network in which individuals interact only through one network, while in reality (same as in epidemic and information spreading), the same set of nodes might interact through multiple networks with different topologies and dynamical properties. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Each layer could have particular features that are different from the rest, which make the multiplex network define a richer structure of interactions. 26 Under the framework of the multiplex network, there has been growing interest in exploring the interplay between epidemic spreading with human response, 27-33 since it is natural for people to take measures when they become aware of epidemics. Two interdependent layers can be used for modeling different dynamical processes, and the interactions between layers represent the coevolution of the processes. Several works have studied the problem by changing the model of information spreading, such as by considering the information spreading process as a SIS model; Granell et al. 27 discovered the emergence of a metacritical point where the diffusion of awareness is able to control the onset of epidemics, whereas Guo et al. 28 replaced the SIS model by a threshold model and found a two-stage effect on epidemic threshold. Besides, Granell et al. 29 also analyzed the consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final outcome of the epidemic incidence, and the results showed that mass media could make the metacritical point disappear.",

            "text": "Until now, people pay much attention on the spreading model for the multiplex network, while the topology structure of it has gained little attention. In other words, all these models can be defined as connectivity model, where connections among individuals are long-lived elements. [34] [35] [36] [37] However, with the development of various kinds of social networks, in many cases, the interactions among individuals are rapidly changing and are characterized by processes with duration being defined on a very short time scale, such as information diffusion over an email, mobile calls among individuals, and so on. 38 Since a time-aggregated representation of network's interactions neglects the time-varying nature of real systems, 35 it is meaningful for us to model the information layer as a time varying network and to study the effects that information spreading process has on epidemic spreading. This scenario is common in reality if we consider the spreading of epidemic information originating from social media, for example, the spreading of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes. During this period, people can know about this epidemic from many sources, such as television (TV), radios, and Internet. Let us take TV as an example: the announcer can be regarded as an activated node and the connections between him and listeners are time-varying, which makes the proper topology of the connections be a time-varying network. At the same time, in order to decrease the infection probability, everyone needs to avoid contacts with strangers. And then, it is obvious that the contagion spreading layer can be treated as a static one. Therefore, in this paper, to fill this gap, a multiplex network with two layers is built. Specifically, the information spreading layer is a time varying network generated by the activity driven model, 34 and the other one is a static network. We extend the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) 27 to derive the epidemic threshold of the model analytically. Compared with extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the method shows high accuracy for the prediction of the epidemic threshold. Besides, by considering different spreading models, namely, the SIS model and the threshold model, of the time varying network, we explored the interplay between epidemic spreading with information spreading. The results show that the coexistence of antagonistic spreading effects raises interesting physical phenomena, such as not only makes the epidemic threshold become larger but also lowers the density of the final epidemic size. Corresponding to different models, the metacritical point and two-stage effects also exist in the time varying cases, which verify again that these phenomena are rooted in the competition principle of the multiplex network model. Furthermore, we also find that the temporal changes in the topology hinder the spread of awareness which directly affect the epidemic threshold, especially when the awareness layer is the threshold model.",

The awareness layer corresponds to the spread of information about epidemics, where individuals can be aware or unaware. Besides, there is a certain probability for the two states transforming between each other. More specifically, aware individuals have a probability of d forgetting epidemics while unaware individuals can become aware with the probability k through communication with aware individuals. As an important way to describe information diffusion process, the activity driven model is used to generate the connections among individuals on the awareness layer. 34 Meanwhile, on the epidemic layer, there are two categories of individuals, i.e., S (susceptible) individuals and I (infected) individuals. Furthermore, the contagion layer, where the epidemic spreading process described by the classic SIS model occurs, is a static one. Because of the existence of coupled dynamical processes, it produces three kinds of states for each individual, including US (unaware and susceptible), AS (aware and susceptible), and AI (aware and infected), as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Under the assumption of the SIS model for the spreading of epidemic, a susceptible individual can be infected by an infected neighbor with the probability b, and at the same time, an infected individual can recover to be susceptible with probability l. If an individual is infected, it is natural that this individual becomes aware of the epidemic. However, if one susceptible individual is aware of the epidemic, the infectivity b can be reduced by a factor, which results from individual's behavioral responses to the presence of the epidemic. 27 We use b U and b A to represent the infection rates without and with awareness, respectively. For the sake of simplicity, we will present the results for b A \u00bc 0 in this paper, which correspond to complete immunity for aware individuals.",

            "text": "In order to analyze the coupled dynamical processes on top of the multiplex network, we need to explore the details of the model. As described above, the multiplex network consists of two layers with different topology structures. The awareness layer is a time-varying network which is generated by the activity driven model, while the contagion layer is a static network. The activity driven model used for the spreading of information can be depicted as follows: 34 first, we consider N individuals and assign to each individual i an activity rate a i \u00bc gx i , which is defined as the probability per unit time to create new contacts with other individuals. The activity potentials x i are assigned according to a probability distribution F(x) and are bounded in the interval n x i 1. Then, at each time step, with probability a i Dt, each individual i is activated and generates m connections with other randomly selected individuals. After we build the network, information spreading process, which is the same as in the classic SIS model, will happen on it. At the next time step, we delete all the edges and repeat the above steps. It is obvious that in the model, individuals do not have memory of previous steps. Since many empirical researches show that power-law distribution of F(x) fits the real world networks, 34 in the paper, we make F(x) take the form: F\u00f0x\u00de / x \u00c0c . As a result of the coupled dynamical processes, it is worth noting that each individual in this multiplex network can only be in one of the three kinds of states: unaware and susceptible (US), aware and infected (AI), and aware and susceptible (AS). To help readers have a clear understanding of our model, we list the meanings of some key parameters used in our model in Table I. In the following, with the help of MMCA method which can be illustrated by the way of probability tree, [27] [28] [29] [30] we are able to obtain the epidemic threshold of our model. In Fig. 2 , we reveal the possible states and their transitions in our model. Here, let fa ij \u00f0t\u00deg N\u00c2N represents the adjacent matrix of the awareness layer at time t. Meanwhile, fb ij g N\u00c2N is the adjacent matrix of the contagion layer. Since at time t individual i can only be in one of the three states, we denote the probabilities of the three states as p AI i \u00f0t\u00de; p AS i \u00f0t\u00de; p US i \u00f0t\u00de, respectively. Furthermore, on the awareness layer, we define the probability for unaware individual i staying unaware as FIG. 1. A simple example of the structure of the multiplex network proposed in the paper. The awareness layer is a time varying network where the spreading of awareness happens. At each time step, the topology structure of the awareness layer is built according to the activity driven model. Relying on the newly built network, the individuals interact with each other to change the states: unaware (green node) and aware (yellow node). The other layer corresponds to the network where epidemic transfers among two kinds of nodes, namely, susceptible (green node) and infected (red node). Individuals on two layers are the same. In particular, only three kinds of states exist in the multiplex network: unaware and susceptible, aware and infected, and aware and susceptible. Note that in the figure, red individuals on the time varying network represent the activated ones and each activated individual can have 2 connections with other individuals at each time step.

From the results above, it is clear that the MMCA method has a high accuracy to predict the epidemic threshold, no matter what values other parameters are set to be. Besides, there are also some interesting phenomena revealed by our model. When the value of l is large, while the value of d is small, the value of aware probability k has an obvious effect on the epidemic threshold. The reason is that at this condition, it is easy for the aware nodes to stay in the aware state, while at the same time, the recovery ability of the nodes is strong. These two effects lead the epidemics to be difficult to outbreak. Hence, if we increase k, which means that the unaware nodes can become aware more easily, the epidemic threshold becomes larger. However, if l is small and d is large, it is easy for the epidemics to outbreak. And then, even if we increase k and nodes become aware with higher probability, the large value of d makes nodes forget the epidemics in a short time, which will decrease the spread speed of awareness. That is why in this case, k has a little effect on the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, note that there also exists a region bounded by 1 m\u00f0hai\u00feha 2 i\u00de ; 1",

It is clear that for both models, with the increase in m, the epidemic threshold and final epidemic size become smaller. The reason is that m represents the number of edges each active node can connect, the larger the m is, the denser is the network. As a result, the spreading process on the dense network is quicker, which makes the nodes become aware easier. This will then suppress the spreading of epidemics. Moreover, the results also show that the threshold model is more susceptible to random changes in the topology of time varying network, since the fluctuation of the final epidemic size, as well as the epidemic threshold, is much larger in this case (Fig. 9 ). In addition, as described above, the change of the varying topology of awareness layer can result in different spreading processes for awareness, and then, the epidemic spreading process is also changed. It is also meaningful for us to quantify to what extent the epidemic spreading is affected by the awareness parameter, which is k for the SIS model or a for the threshold model. Thus, in the following, with the help of MMCA method, we study the evolution of epidemic threshold according to the values of l and d. In order to have a better understanding of the effect of k or a, we plot the phase space of l and d, and the color of it corresponds to the value which is the epidemic threshold at k \u00bc 0.8 (a \u00bc 0.2) minus the epidemic threshold at k \u00bc 0.2 (a \u00bc 0.8), as illustrated in Fig. 10 . The results show that the awareness parameter has a more obvious effect on the threshold model since the value of b a\u00bc0:2 \u00c0 b a\u00bc0:8 is much larger than that of the SIS model, especially when d is small and l is large.

Afterwards, we build the probability tree for the coupled dynamical processes to reveal the transitions among different states of individuals. Using the MMCA method, the epidemic threshold can be obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem. Regardless of whether the information spreading process is defined as the SIS model or the threshold model, our numerical results of epidemic threshold show high accuracy compared with extensive MC simulations. Specifically, when the information spreading process is the SIS model, the coupled dynamical processes make it difficult for epidemics to outbreak and can also lower the density of the infected individuals. However, if the information spreading process is assumed to be a threshold model, the epidemic threshold exists as a sharp like transition when the local threshold a % 0:5 though all the epidemic thresholds are smaller than the single layer threshold.",

From the point of view of information diffusion model, our results show that temporal changes in the topology also hinder the spread of awareness, especially for the threshold model. Since in reality with the burst development of social networks, the way how information spreads is a very complex problem for scientists from many different fields, proposing a proper model to study it is of great significance. Although in this paper, we use the activity driven model to construct the propagation path of information, there are still many other different approaches to realize the goal, for example, bursty model 36 and so on. Only if we have a good understanding of the two dynamical processes, which include information spreading and epidemic spreading, it can be possible for us to explore the coupled effects between them. Besides, the results show that changes in the topology of the awareness layer could change the location of the metacritical point. This is particularly important since a slight delay or advance in the epidemic could have important implications to vaccination strategies. 40 Overall, our results give us some useful suggestions about how to model this kind of coupled system and also shed light on new strategies on restraining epidemics.",
