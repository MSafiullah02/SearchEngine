            "text": "The immune system has evolved in a way that optimizes the chance of encounter between the rare antigen-specific T and B cells of the adaptive immune system with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the innate immune system in organized lymphoid tissues, such as the spleen, lymph nodes (LNs) and Peyer's patches. These so-called secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) have three unique features. First, they filter lymph or blood and sample the antigens in these fluids. Second, they allow entry of antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) and other innate immune cells. Third, they allow recirculating naive T and B cells that have encountered antigen to extravasate, arrest temporarily, proliferate and differentiate [1]. To achieve this goal, the LNs and spleen are connected during embryogenesis to the lymph and bloodstream and are organized into well-defined areas rich in T or B cells. These areas are supported by a network of mesenchymal cells that provide the chemokine cues and extracellular matrix on which cells can meaningfully migrate and find each other in such a complex structure 2, 3. This highly efficient structural organization of antigen encounter and lymphocyte migration and activation can also be recapitulated after birth, in the form of TLOs; particularly when there is continued need for extravasation of leukocytes and a persistent source of antigen, such as seen in zones of infection, transplant rejection and auto-immune attack (see Table 1\nfor an overview).",

            "text": "It is well known that when inflammation becomes chronic, plasma cells and lymphocytes gradually increase in number, lymphangiogenesis is induced, and blood vessels acquire characteristics of high endothelial venules (HEVs) specialized in allowing extravasation of lymphocytes. In some conditions, the chronic infiltrate organizes into structured lesions, such as those seen in chronic granulomatous inflammation in tuberculosis, Crohn's disease, and sarcoidosis. Sometimes, the chronic infiltrate organizes into distinct T and B cell-rich aggregates. Various terms, such as ectopic lymphoid tissue, lymphoid tissue neogenesis and TLOs, have been used to describe the occurrence of these organized structures. These structures are also named according to their anatomical site, such as inducible bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) and vascular associated lymphoid tissue (VALT). Although in most disease models the structures do not fully cover the proposed TLO definition (Box 1\n), we use the term TLO throughout this paper because we believe the functional resemblance with SLOs is much more relevant than the structural resemblance.Box 1Definition and identification of TLOsA problem that arises in defining TLO structures is that the difference between a chronic infiltrate and a TLO resides in the degree of their internal organization. According to pathologists, the term TLO can only be used when all the following criteria are fulfilled: (i) the organized infiltrate contains anatomically distinct yet adjacent T and B cell compartments; (ii) the T cell area contains an extensive network of FRCs; (iii) PNAd+ or MECA79+ HEVs are present in the T cell area; (iv) there is evidence of B cell class switching and GC reactions in the B cell follicles; (v) AID enzyme is present; and (vi) FDCs are present. Often, it appears that, strictly speaking, not all criteria are fulfilled, but the organized structure can still function as a TLO.",

It is becoming clear that these structures could have similar yet distinct functions in the induction and maintenance of adaptive immune responses. In this review, we first describe the molecular and cellular signals that lead to development of TLO structures in several disease models. Second, the functional importance of TLO structures is discussed in infection and autoimmunity.",

            "text": "Before discussing the mechanisms controlling TLO development during chronic inflammation, it is important to summarize organogenesis of SLOs (reviewed in detail [2] and summarized in Figure 1\n). SLOs develop in predefined areas in the embryo, often at the crossroads of lymphatics. The lymph node anlagen are first identified in mice on embryonic day 14.5 by the presence of retinoic-acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)\u03b3+ LTi cells [4]. During SLO development [2], it is crucial that CD3\u2013CD4+CD45+ LTi cells interact with stromal lymphoid tissue organizer (LTo) cells in a process involving lymphotoxin (LT)\u03b11\u03b22 signaling to the LT\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). When these cells interact, LTo cells express several adhesion molecules [vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)1, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MADCAM)1] and homeostatic chemokines chemokine CC ligand (CCL)19 and CCL21 for T cells and DCs; chemokine CXC ligand (CXCL)13 for attraction of B cells]. These molecules act as the driving force for recruitment of lymphocytes. In addition, production of lymphangiogenetic growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, VEGF-D, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), leads to formation of Lyve-1+ lymphatic vessels 5, 6. LTo cells develop further into follicular DCs (FDCs) and fibroblast reticular cells (FRCs) that provide the conduit framework on which T and B cells migrate and interact with each other. Before LTi cells can cluster, an LT\u03b11\u03b22-independent instructive signal is given to local fibroblasts to start producing the initial CXCL13 to attract LTi cells. Recent insights indicate that signals derived from the nervous system could provide this first signal for LN development 7, 8. Together, these studies have highlighted the importance of interactions between hematopoietic cells and stromal cells, and between LT\u03b11\u03b22 signaling and homeostatic chemokines in the complex organization of SLOs.",

Conversely, in experiments in which either CXCL13, its receptor CXCR5, CCR7 or LT\u03b1 was genetically absent or neutralized, TLO structures did not develop in various infectious and autoimmune models 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. As in SLO formation, LT\u03b1 seems to instruct stromal cells to develop into FDCs and HEVs, whereas CCL19 and CCL21 acting via CCR7 control the organization of the T cell zones of the TLO 17, 20, 23, 24.",

In the perivascular TLOs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH), strong immunoreactivity for IL-7 very close to ER\u2013TR7+ FRCs was found [26].",

            "text": "In contrast to the involvement of CD3\u2013CD4+CD45+ LTi cells in the formation of LNs, their necessity for TLO induction is controversial [2]. The differentiation of LTi cells from lymphoid progenitors involves the transcription factors Id2 and ROR-\u03b3t. Mice lacking these factors do not develop most LNs (except nasal associated mucosal tissues, NALT, and tear duct associated lymphoid tissue, TALT) 4, 27, 28, 29. When Id2\n\u2013/\u2013 or Rorc\n\u2013/\u2013 mice, which are lacking LTi cells, are infected with influenza virus, they develop normal iBALT structures in the lung 23, 30, 31. Other phenomena that do not depend on LTi cells are postnatal development of omental milky spots (these are organized lymphomyelopoietic tissue in the peritoneal cavity), isolated lymphoid follicles and TLOs in the intestine caused by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, and TLOs in autoimmune thyroiditis or insulitis 12, 31, 32, 33. The controversy surrounding the role of LTi cells stems from three observations. First, adoptive transfer studies provide evidence that injection of LTi cells into normal skin is sufficient to induce TLO structures [34]. Second, LTi cells have been observed in models of spontaneous TLO development, such as the perivascular TLOs seen in hypercholesterolemic Apoe\n\u2013/\u2013 mice and the iBALT structures seen in neonatal lungs exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [30]. Human TLOs, such as those seen in IPAH, also contain adult LTi-like cells that are CD4\u2013, cKit+ and OX40L positive, and also express RORc and Id2 [26]. Third, overexpression of homeostatic chemokines under a tissue-specific promoter to induce TLOs (e.g. RIP or the intestine-specific villin promoter driving expression of CXCL13) and transgenic overexpression of IL-7 both result in increased numbers of LTi cells and dependence of TLO formation on LTi cells [33]. However, in these systems, lymphoid organogenesis starts before birth, which means that the requirement for LTi cells in induction of TLO formation could be overestimated. Nevertheless, most groups agree that LT\u03b11\u03b22 is necessary for TLO induction 17, 21.",

It has been proposed that B cells, T cells or DCs could substitute for LTi cells in their inductive function, especially when they are activated and express LT\u03b11\u03b22 on their surface 31, 35, 36, 37. Progression towards mature, fully structured TLOs is dependent on LT\u03b2-sufficient B cells [24]. In a model of thyroid overexpression of CCL21, it has been shown that CD3+CD4+ activated T cells interact with DCs at sites of chronic inflammation, and subsequently the activated T cells act as LTi cells in the absence of Id2 activity [12]. In two recent studies on neonatal mice exposed to endotoxin inhalation and mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an activated T helper (Th)17 CD4 T cell population was found to be involved in inducing TLO structures 30, 38. RORC+ IL-17-producing cells have also been found inside TLOs of patients with IPAH. In humans, Th17 cells express the CCR6 receptor, and in the bloodstream of IPAH patients, circulating CCR6+ cells are fewer, whereas the ligand CCL20 is produced in the perivascular TLOs [26]. However, TLOs seem to develop normally in Ccr6\n\u2013/\u2013 mice [30]. The induction of TLOs by Th17 cells is dependent on expression of podoplanin, but why this is so remains to be studied. One possibility is that podoplanin is required for retention of Th17 cells at sites of TLO formation 30, 38. It remains to be seen whether all forms of TLO depend on IL-17 production, and whether IL-17A and/or IL-17F is involved. In this regard, iBALT induced by infection with modified vaccinia virus Ankara or influenza virus is not affected by deficiency of IL-17A 31, 39. LT\u03b2 signaling is not triggered only via LT\u03b11\u03b22; LIGHT (TNFSF14) can also bind the LT\u03b2 receptor. In a model of nonobese diabetes (NOD), LIGHT expressed on T cells has been shown to be important in the development and maintenance of TLO structures [40].",

DCs activate T cells, therefore, it has been suggested that DCs are sufficient for TLO induction [41]. Repeated injection of DCs into the lungs of mice is sufficient for induction of iBALT structures accompanied by induction of myofibroblast differentiation 37, 42. During formation of Peyer's patches, a CD11c+ cell type expressing LT\u03b1\u03b2 accumulates at the LN anlagen and is necessary for stromal instruction [8]. DCs might also directly instruct stromal cells irrespective of their effects on T cells. In TLO structures induced in the thymus, DCs are specifically necessary for induction of lymphangiogenesis from stromal cells [43]. How DCs induce TLOs is less clear. In virus-induced iBALT, mainly CD11b+ DCs accumulate; these cells express instructive LT\u03b11\u03b22 and at the same time produce the homeostatic chemokines CXCL13 and CCL19/CCL21 [37]. However, in some models, mostly pDCs accumulate, suggesting a functional role for type I interferons. This is the case in TLOs found in end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and in a murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) model 44, 45. Three studies have shown that depletion of DCs leads to disappearance of existing TLO structures, suggesting that DCs are necessary for structural organization and maintenance of TLOs; probably through transpresentation of chemokines, or by provision of a continuous source of antigen presentation to T cells 37, 43, 46.",

It has become clear that TLOs have the same complicated network of stromal cells and the conduits they form, although their function remains undetermined [33]. Upon LT\u03b2R triggering by LTi or inflammatory cells, LTo cells express cell adhesion molecules and produce chemokines that attract B and T cells, produce cytokines that maintain lymphocyte viability (e.g. IL-7), and differentiate into FRCs and FDCs. LT\u03b2 receptor signaling from host cells is involved in formation of lymphatic vessels in thyroid TLOs 21, 43 and formation of the reticular network [33]. Several studies have suggested that LTo and FRC cells of the T cell zone, like myofibroblasts, stain positive for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and produce desmin [48]. It has been elegantly demonstrated that inflammation can induce this program of myofibroblast differentiation in tissue-resident fibroblasts, while at the same time inducing the production of the homeostatic chemokines CXCL13 and CCL21, and lymphangiogenic cytokines. This programming does not require adaptive immunity, innate lymphoid cells, LTi cells, inflammasomes, or pattern recognition receptors, but is dependent on a myeloid cell population; probably neutrophils. The molecular signal released by these myeloid inflammatory cells is not known [6]. In a model of atherosclerosis, it has been shown that mouse aorta smooth muscle cells can differentiate into a cell type that resembles the LTo cell 19, 49. Myofibroblasts are typically seen at sites of scarring and fibrosis, which might explain the occurrence of TLOs in patients with COPD, scleroderma, lung fibrosis and primary biliary cirrhosis 50, 51, 52.",

One caveat is that these studies were performed in mice lacking LNs, which could have led to overestimation of the potential of TLOs [23]. However, recent work has suggested that TLOs can be immune inductive even in mice with normal LN anatomy and a fully functional immune system. DCs in TLOs often have an activated phenotype, suggesting that they are the predominant APCs stimulating immunity [45]. The function of DCs in TLO biology has been studied mainly in iBALT structures induced by modified Ankara vaccine virus or influenza virus 37, 46. Preformed iBALT structures collect DCs that are injected into the trachea, but it is unclear how these DCs reach the T cell area of iBALT [46]. One possibility is that iBALT structures are connected to afferent lymphatics located immediately underneath the epithelial basement membrane [52]. In many instances, the TLOs are found immediately next to lymphatics, but no study so far has been able to determine if these lymphatics are afferent (bringing antigen to the TLO) or efferent (exporting lymphocytes). It is also possible that the remodeling around blood vessels and the subepithelial areas leads to formation of a conduit system that provides a path for the encountered antigens to reach the TLO. In support of this possibility is the close resemblance between the type of extracellular matrix found in atherosclerosis-associated or IPAH-associated TLOs and the one found in the FRC network and conduit system of LNs 19, 26. Whatever the mechanism, TLO structures do allow the extravasation of naive T cells and their differentiation into effector T cells upon contact with DCs [46].",

In these TLOs, T lymphocytes are detected that destroy islets and plasma cells with specificity for insulin 40, 60. The expansion of B cells inside an individual TLO around islets is often oligoclonal, suggesting the presence of an autoantigen [61].

Strikingly, the disease was also prevented by treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) to saturate Fc receptors on effector cells. This finding shows that these TLOs contribute to immunopathology via a humoral mechanism [31]. Chronic alloimmune responses induce TLOs in mice and humans, and these TLOs could be involved in chronic rejection. Transplantation of skin harboring TLOs to mice of a different strain lacking all LNs and spleen leads to chronic rejection, whereas transplantation of skin lacking TLOs is not rejected [63].",

In human autoimmune thyroiditis, most B cells inside ectopic GCs bound the autoantigens thyroglobulin and thyroidal peroxidase [66]. A study on SLE patients has confirmed the restricted B cell repertoire, with formation of isotype-switched antibodies that are deposited in the glomerular basement membrane [67]. TLOs have also been found in the meninges of patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; a severe feature of SLE.

One possibility is to interfere with the LT\u03b2 receptor. In a model of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice, disrupting TLOs by antagonizing the action of LIGHT with LT\u03b2R inhibits formation of autoaggressive T cells and progression to diabetes [40]. Similarly, disruption of TLOs in the salivary glands that develop in the NOD model of Sj\u00f6gren's disease also leads to partial restoration of salivary function [18]. Another approach could be to target crucial TLO chemokines or their receptors, such as CXCL13 or CXCR5. In a model of RA, Cxcr5\n\u2013/\u2013 mice have significantly reduced joint destruction [20]. In a model of diabetes in NOD mice, neutralization of CXCL13 leads to disorganized TLOs, yet there is no clear effect on diabetes incidence [71].
