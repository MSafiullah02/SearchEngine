Medical history was unremarkable with no history of cigarette smoking. On questioning, patient reported history of intermittent dry cough and mild fever over the last 3 days. Blood pressure was 135/90 mmHg. Temperature was 38 \u00b0C and the oxygen saturation level was 97% (SpO2) while the patient was breathing ambient air. Clinical history and slit lamp examination were consistent with a viral conjunctivitis in the RE. Because of the respiratory symptoms and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in our Region, a chest X-ray scan was ordered and showed increased bronchovascular marking with no definite signs suggestive of pneumonia (Supplemental Figure). Nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay were taken and turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Patient was admitted for observation and received supportive therapy consisting of oral paracetamol 1 g three times/day and a tapering course of topical tobramycin\u2013dexamethasone in the RE. Given normalization of temperature and improvement of both the respiratory and the ocular symptoms, patient was discharged after 3 days of observation and home isolation for 14 days was advised.",

Since it has been speculated that the virus may enters the tears through droplets, which may pass through the nasolacrimal ducts, and then into the respiratory tract [4], conjunctivitis may represent one of the first symptoms of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first European confirmed COVID-19 case presenting with conjunctivitis as the first symptom. The present case outlines the importance of questioning patients presenting with conjunctivitis about respiratory and other systemic symptoms which should prompt clinicians to rule out COVID-19 infection.",
