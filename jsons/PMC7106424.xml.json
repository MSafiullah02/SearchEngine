As blood collection increases and the needs for red blood cells surpass that of clinical plasma or cryoprecipitate, this will generate a larger number of plasma units not used for transfusions.

More countries are therefore becoming interested in fractionation programs that make use of such wasted plasma to improve access to plasma-derived products of assured quality. One major issue is that currently collected plasma in low- and medium-income countries typically does not meet specifications for fractionation and is therefore discarded. This situation may however gradually improve since the recent listing of blood components on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines [9] that should contribute increasing government awareness on the need for well-organized blood services, and implementation of good manufacturing practice (GMP) principles in blood establishments for improved product quality, safety and supply.",

In such a situation, plasma is sent to a licensed fractionator, and final products are returned to the plasma supplier for use in the country after licensing. Such a program can be implemented within a relatively short time (1~3 years) provided a sufficient plasma volume can meet the fractionator's and regulatory authority's requirements [12]. This involves the signing of a contractual agreement between the plasma supplier and fractionator. Contract fractionation requires strict oversight from regulatory authorities of both the plasma suppliers and fractionators to ensure quality requirements of the plasma for fractionation and fractionated end-products. Invariably, blood establishments, subjected to inspections and audits, will have to improve their working methodologies, practices, and procedures to follow fractionation production criteria for plasma needed by fractionators and regulators [12].",

The traditional tripod of safety of blood and plasma products for well-known blood-borne viruses [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and C virus (HCV)] is, in addition to a well-structured blood collection organization [26], selection of donors, testing of blood donations, and viral-reduction treatments implemented during plasma product manufacture [27]. In early phases of a new infection, selection of donors and testing of donations might not be effective or applicable if infective donors are asymptomatic or a test is unavailable. In such situations, viral safety relies solely on the robustness of viral-reduction steps already in place in the manufacturing process of plasma products. Over the years and following the identification of the transmission of HIV, HBV, and HCV enveloped viruses, and then non-enveloped parvovirus B19 and HAV viruses by plasma products, substantial progress has been made by the plasma fractionation industry, under close supervision of the main regulatory authorities, to develop, validate, and implement effective viral-inactivation treatments. For instance, a technology like solvent-detergent has been able to eliminate risks from lipid-enveloped viruses, including agents like WNV, DENV, SARS, avian influenza virus, and chikungunya when they entered the plasma supply and before the introduction of test procedures, if any, for viral markers [28], [29], [30].",

Under the current state of viral-reduction technology implemented by plasma fractionators and multi-step purification procedures responsible for removing viruses, it seems scientifically reasonable to conclude that potential residual infectious risks for most plasma products would be restricted to emerging resistant small (<15~20 nm) non-enveloped viruses.",
