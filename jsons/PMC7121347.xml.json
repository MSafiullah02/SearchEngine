Vaccines have emerged as effective treatments to prevent or reduce the burdens of already developed diseases. This is achieved by means of activating various components of the immune system to generate systemic inflammatory reactions targeting infectious agents or diseased cells for control/elimination. DNA virus-based genetic vaccines gained significant attention in the past decades owing to the development of DNA manipulation technologies, which allowed engineering of recombinant viral vectors encoding sequences for foreign antigens (Ags) or their immunogenic epitopes as well as various immunomodulatory molecules. Having emerged as a result of the parasite\u2013host coevolution, viruses as vehicles for delivery and expression of Ag-encoding sequences may also function as immune adjuvants, enhancing immune responses to the transgene-expressed Ags. Despite tremendous progress in the past 50 years, many hurdles still remain for the development of virus-based vaccines and their effective clinical use.",

Although this chapter primarily focuses on the use of human Ad for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, application of other viral vectors for vaccine development will also be briefly discussed. We will present vaccines first according to delivery systems/viral vector types and then with regard to their clinical applications, i.e., prophylactic or therapeutic. This will lead to detailed description of Ad as a vaccine vector, its taxonomy (serotype diversity), as well as the genomic and molecular structures. Ad biological properties related to its potential role as a vaccine vector will be highlighted along with advantages and potential hurdles for vaccine development. Along these lines, we will discuss in detail the \u201cAg capsid incorporation\u201d strategy aimed at generating robust humoral Ag-specific immune responses while circumventing vector-specific preexisting immunity.",

            "text": "Advances in basic knowledge in immunology along with the development of recombinant DNA technology in the past 50 years prompted extensive efforts in vaccine development and led to second-generation vaccines, including recombinant vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology substantially expanded the repertoire of vaccine types, which may differ with regard to the form of immunological target (immunogen) and route of delivery. Recombinant vaccines comprise several distinct classes: (1) \u201csubunit\u201d vaccines that are typically obtained by genetic cloning and expression of immunogenic proteins or their individual subunits/domains using various expression systems, such as bacterial, yeast, or mammalian; (2) \u201cconjugate\u201d vaccines, a special type of \u201csubunit\u201d vaccines using Ags or toxoids conjugated to polysaccharides, enhancing their immunogenicity, such as Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine; (3) DNA or \u201cnaked\u201d DNA vaccines; and (4) viral-vectored vaccines. In the latter instances, foreign Ags are expressed in the host cells upon the delivery of recombinant DNA molecules coding for such Ags, such as West Nile virus experimental vaccine (Alarcon et al. 1999). In contrast to \u201cnaked\u201d DNA vaccines, also known as \u201cthird-generation vaccines,\u201d virus-based vaccines use recombinant viral vectors as natural vehicles to deliver foreign Ag-encoding sequences. The term \u201cvectored vaccine\u201d is generally used for live recombinant viruses or bacteria representing a natural carrier or \u201cvector\u201d capable of incorporating transgenes from a pathogen and expressing it in the host without itself causing illness. Viral vectors provide a substantially more efficient Ag delivery method, known as \u201ctransduction,\u201d as compared to \u201cnaked\u201d DNA. Besides, naked DNA-based vaccines were found to be unable to induce strong cellular immune responses in humans. By contrast, Ags delivered in the context of viral vectors are more immunogenic than the same Ags delivered as proteins or the Ag-encoding naked DNA. This is primarily due to the ability of mammalian innate immune system to recognize viruses as danger signals through Toll-like receptors, leading to the generation/integration of innate and adaptive immune responses for a more pronounced immune efficacy against the virus.",

Recently, vaccine design expanded towards replication-competent viral vectors. The advantage of replicative viruses as vectors is the dramatic (~10,000-fold) amplification of transgene and its expression because of excessive viral DNA replication. This enhances immunization efficiency and allows decreased vaccine dosing. The disadvantages include cell lysis, which typically occurs upon infection as the ultimate step in viral life cycle and may reduce the duration of transgene expression and vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, development of vaccines based on replication-competent viral vectors requires adequate animal models that should not only be immunocompetent but also fully permissive for replication of a given virus, which may not be available or cost permissive.",

Various strategies for transductional retargeting of viral vectors have been developed in the recent years. A large variety of viral vector systems, each with its advantages and disadvantages, have been used for vaccine development. A more detailed description of those vector systems is provided in Sect. 8.3.",

Preexisting immunity (PEI), particularly Ag-specific antibodies (Abs) against many human viruses typically found in patients, significantly compromises clinical efficacy of the corresponding viral vectors when used for vaccine or gene therapy applications. Many strategies have been developed to circumvent PEI to virus-based vectors, some of which will be described in other sections. Low immunogenicity of some Ags may require a more complex regimen of vaccination involving a \u201cprime\u2013boost\u201d approach that may combine two different vaccine types for repeated delivery of the same Ag: a DNA vaccine followed by a viral vaccine or vice versa. Many contemporary vaccines are designed using a polyvalent approach allowing immunization against more than one Ag, serological variant (serotype) of a given pathogen, or even several different pathogens simultaneously. Optimal vaccination protocols are developed by considering various factors, such as dose, route of administration, type of priming and boosting vectors, number of boost immunizations, and their timing.",

These vaccines are administered to the host prior to an encounter with pathogenic infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria. A single exception is the rabies vaccine, developed by Pasteur more than 100 years ago, which is administered only after exposure to the virus. However, the application of therapeutic vaccines has recently been on the rise owing to significant technological developments and comprehensive understanding of the immune system. Unlike prophylactic vaccines that achieve their disease-preventive effect by generating humoral immune responses, therapeutic vaccines often function through robust T-cell responses against key viral Ags. The contribution of humoral responses to the therapeutic efficacy of a vaccine depends on the target pathogen or disease. Therapeutic vaccines have been developed or under development for various indications, including persistent infections, such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, malaria, as well as noninfectious chronic diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, gastric ulcers, prion-caused mad cow disease, Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and various cancers.",

While HPV does not cause obvious disease, it sets the infected host at risk of developing cancers similar to HBV and HCV. While HPV, HBV, and HCV can be eliminated by the immune system after acute infection or sometimes in chronic phase, persistent HIV infection has proved more challenging. Although there are various contributing factors, the integration of HIV DNA into the genome of the virus-targeted immune T cells appears to play a determining role (Finzi et al. 1999). Unlike prophylactic vaccines where the induction of effector immune responses against pathogens is the primary requirement for vaccine efficacy, therapeutic vaccines against chronic infections and cancer are required to overcome two major obstacles to achieve efficacy: (1) induction of effector immune responses in a host that may have developed tolerance to the pathogen or cancer Ags and (2) overcoming various immune evasion mechanisms employed by the chronic infection and progressing cancer. Furthermore, therapeutic vaccines are administered to patients with suppressed immunity due to prior chemo- and/or radiation therapy treatments and in already developed disease background.",

AAV2 is the most commonly used serotype for transgene delivery. Although, the majority of the human population is seropositive for AAV, no significant adverse events during either pretrial efficacy studies or clinical trials involving AAV were observed (Maguire et al. 2009; Bainbridge et al. 2008). The wild-type (wt) AAV integrates into a specific region of the human chromosome 19 (between q13.3 and q13.4) upon host cell infection (Kotin et al. 1992), whereas this ability for site-specific integration is lost in rAAV, possibly due to deletion of the viral rep gene. Although the integrating gene delivery systems allow for a more stable transgene expression than the episomal ones, integration of foreign DNA in the cellular chromosomal DNA is associated with the risk of insertional mutagenesis. This, in turn, may cause malignant cell transformation (Romano 2012). Therapeutic transgenes and internal promoters, regulating transgene expression in rAAV-based vectors, replace the viral rep and cap genes (Fig. 8.1) (Bartel et al. 2012). Although AAV vectors are less immunogenic than adenoviral vectors, low transduction efficiency for certain tissues, inability for targeted delivery to specific cell types, relatively low transgene-carrying capacity (~4 kb), and dependence on a helper virus for propagation limit utility of these vectors for human clinical applications.",

For example, a clinical trial in advanced cancer patients conducted in China evaluated the safety of adoptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated by the coculture with dendritic cells (DCs) transduced with rAAV encoding carcinoembryonic Ag (CEA). This study demonstrated that infusion of CEA-specific CTL was well tolerated and showed no severe adverse reactions in cancer patients (Di et al. 2012). Two phase I clinical trials (one for rAAV2 and the other for rAAV1) and one phase II clinical trial (with rAAV1) for the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene therapy have shown promising results. However, levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin were only 3\u20135 % of the target range, indicating the need to increase the dose of the vector and/or gene expression levels to achieve a therapeutic range (Mueller and Flotte 2013).",

Scientists have taken an alternative approach to conventional expression of immunization Ags in the context of viral vectors. This approach embodies genetic incorporation of Ags into viral capsids. This innovative paradigm is based on presenting Ags as components of viral capsids, achieved through genetic fusion to or incorporation in viral capsid protein(s), rather than vector-expressed transgenes. Vaccine design using Ad vectors displaying Ags on their capsid surface is known as the \u201cAg capsid incorporation\u201d strategy. Whole Ags or immunogenic peptides incorporated into the viral capsid offer a potential advantage for vaccine applications. Owing to processing of the capsid-incorporated Ags through the exogenous pathways native to the Ad capsid proteins, the Ags could accrue their immunostimulatory potential. A strong humoral response against the incorporated Ags, similar to the one induced against the Ad capsid proteins, could result from the adjuvant function of the Ad vector.",

A chimeric human rhinovirus HIV was shown to stimulate immunity against HIV-1 (Smith et al. 1994). In addition, combinatorial libraries of human rhinovirus capsid-incorporated HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 (gp41) epitopes were shown to induce Abs with activity that can mimic the NAb effect (Arnold et al. 2009). Preclinical and clinical development of Ad-based HIV vaccines has progressed faster than the development of other vector systems, such as human rhinovirus, owing to the tremendous flexibility of Ad vectors generally exceeding that of the rhinovirus systems. For instance, since human rhinovirus is a relatively small RNA virus, the human rhinovirus platform can only display 60 copies of a single antigenic epitope (Smith et al. 1994). In contrast, the Ad vector capsid platform could allow incorporation of HIV-1 epitopes into four distinct structural proteins/locales including hexon (Abe et al. 2009), fiber, penton base, and pIX capsid proteins (Fig. 8.3) (Matthews 2011; Nemerow et al. 2009; Matthews et al. 2013).\n",

Hexon is the most abundant structural protein of the Ad capsid, accounting for 63 % of its total protein mass (Rux et al. 2003; van Oostrum and Burnett 1985). Sequence analysis of hexon proteins from different Ad species revealed that, in addition to the evolutionarily conserved regions, there are also non-conserved hypervariable regions (HVRs), containing serotype-specific epitopes (Rux et al. 2003; Crawford-Miksza and Schnurr 1996). The loops at the top of the HVRs are the most pliable to modification by genetic engineering. Short heterologous peptides can be incorporated within the HVRs of the hexon without affecting the virion\u2019s stability or biological characteristics. A subset of the modifiable loops is exposed on the surface of the Ad5 capsid. HVRs 1, 2, and 5 have been utilized for peptide or Ag incorporation (Vigne et al. 1999; Wu et al. 2005; Worgall et al. 2005, 2007; McConnell et al. 2006; Matthews et al. 2008; Palma et al. 2011).",

One of the first examples of \u201cAg capsid incorporation\u201d used in the context of Ad was a study (Crompton et al. 1994) where an eight-amino acid sequence of the VP1 capsid protein of poliovirus type 3 was inserted into two distinct regions of the Ad2 hexon protein without affecting the propagation efficiency of one of the resulting chimeric vectors in tissue culture. Antiserum raised against the recombinant Ad vector with the polio epitope insert specifically recognized the VP1 capsid protein of polio type 3. A similar study demonstrated that His6 epitopes could be incorporated into Ad5 hexon HVRs 1\u20137 (now reclassified as 1\u20139) without perturbing viral viability and any major biological characteristics such as replication, thermostability, or native infectivity.

To compare the flexibilities and insertion capacities, the Ad5 hexon\u2019s HVR2 and HVR5 were modified to incorporate identical epitopes of incrementally increasing sizes, ranging from 33 to 83 amino acids, within those locales. Viable vectors were produced with incorporation of 33 amino acids plus a 12-amino acid linker at HVR2 or HVR5. In addition, viable vectors were produced with incorporations of up to 53 amino acids plus a 12-amino acid linker at HVR5. The HVR5 was found to be more permissive, allowing incorporation of peptides of up to 65 amino acids. These model Ags were surface exposed as evidenced by a whole-virus ELISA analysis. In vivo immunization with these vectors demonstrated an Ag-specific immune response (Matthews et al. 2008). Although, in vivo responses were not evaluated in the context of PEI, it is possible that these vectors would indeed escape Ad5 PEI (Matthews et al. 2008).",

To overcome limitations imposed by PEI to Ad5, the authors constructed vectors carrying modifications in the hexon\u2019s HVR5. This study characterized various immunological parameters associated with these vectors, such as vector neutralization, acquisition of adaptive immune response, and comparison of protective immunity. In this regard, Ad-Luc (luciferase protein expressed as a transgene in the Ad E1 region), Ad-HisLuc (His6 epitope presented in HVR5 region and luciferase protein expressed as a transgene), or Ad-END/AAALuc vector (containing three amino acid mutations in HVR5 and expressing luciferase protein) were administered to mice IM. The hexon-modified vector (Ad-HisLuc) generated the lowest Ad5-specific neutralizing activity, which was significantly lower than that generated by Ad-Luc at weeks 6 and 8 and by Ad-End/AAALuc vector at week 8. The individual neutralizing activity in response to Ad-HisLuc immunization was significantly lower than that in response to immunization with Ad-Luc. Further studies support the concept that modified hexon thwarts Ad5 NAbs and promotes cellular immune responses. These findings indicate that a change in the immunogenic epitope is necessary to avoid neutralization by preexisting NAbs (Abe et al. 2009).",

Characteristics of the resulting vector Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) with respect to growth kinetics and thermostability remained unchanged as compared with peptide or Ag capsid-incorporated vectors (Matthews et al. 2006; Li et al. 2010), demonstrating that incorporation of the MPER epitope within HVR2 was not substantially detrimental to the vector\u2019s biology (Matthews et al. 2006; Li et al. 2010). This study was the first demonstration that a disease-specific Ag could be incorporated within Ad5 HVR2. Most importantly, the data demonstrated a humoral anti-HIV response in mice immunized with the hexon-modified Ad vector. Immunization with the MPER-displaying vector allows boosting, in contrast to immunization with AdCMVGag vector, possibly because the Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15 (Gag) vector elicits less of an anti-Ad5 immune response. It is likely that the incorporation of the MPER epitope within this vector reduces the immunogenicity of the Ad5 vector. This finding is notable because HVR2 has not been fully explored for its potential use in \u201cAg capsid incorporation\u201d strategies.",

            "text": "In the immediate future, it is likely that viral vector-based vaccination will become a common clinical intervention. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to design vectors that can overcome Ad5 PEI (Thacker et al. 2009; Seregin and Amalfitano 2009). Towards this end, rare and nonhuman Ad serotypes have been genetically modified for vaccine development. Chimeric Ad vectors could consist of a subportion of the Ad5 vector genome that is replaced with genomic portions of another alternative serotype, thus creating \u201cchimeric\u201d Ad vectors. Alternatively, in a more extreme approach, the entire Ad vector genome could be composed of genes derived solely from alternate Ad serotypes (Noureddini and Curiel 2005; Seregin and Amalfitano 2009; Abbink et al. 2007; Youil et al. 2002; Roberts et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2009; McCoy et al. 2007). Ad hexon and fiber proteins have been manipulated genetically in chimeric strategies, primarily because these proteins are known to be the target of vector NAbs (Molinier-Frenkel et al. 2002; Roy et al. 1998; Wu et al. 2002a; Gall et al. 1996). Several chimeric fiber- and hexon-generating strategies have been employed (Table 8.2) (Seregin and Amalfitano 2009). NAbs generated against hexon HVRs account for 80\u201390 % of the anti-Ad NAb response, which plays a critical role in vector clearance, thereby reducing therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine vectors (Sumida et al. 2005). The importance of the HVRs as NAbs epitopes remains unclear as it relates to Ad5 and other serotypes (Yuan et al. 2009). Therefore, exact mapping of the NAb epitopes in these HVRs may be necessary to improve chimeric Ad5-based vectors (Alba et al. 2009).",

The chimeric vector was successfully \u201crescued\u201d in the HEK293 helper cell line. Ad5/H3 had a significantly slower growth profile as compared to the wt Ad5/H5 vector, indicating that the Ad3 hexon is capable of capsid incorporation and supporting encapsidation of the viral genome but with lower efficiency than the native (Ad5) hexon. The gene transfer efficiency of Ad5/H3 in HeLa cells was also lower than that of Ad5/H5. The host neutralization studies demonstrated that the NAbs against Ad5/H3 and Ad5/H5 generated in immunized C57BL/6 mice did not cross-neutralize each other in the context of in vitro infection of HeLa cells. Therefore, pre-immunization of C57BL/6 mice with one of the two types of vectors did not prevent subsequent infection with the other type, clearly demonstrating that substitution of the Ad5 hexon with the Ad3 hexon can circumvent the host neutralization of the Ad5 (Wu et al. 2002a).",

Previous studies demonstrated that the human coagulation factor X (FX) binds to the Ad5 hexon through a direct interaction between its Gla domain and the hexon HVRs, leading to Ad5 liver uptake/sequestration following its systemic delivery (Waddington et al. 2008; Kalyuzhniy et al. 2008). The binding affinities for FX vary among Ad serotypes and may account for the differences in their hepatocyte transduction efficiencies previously observed in vivo. While Ad2 and Ad5 bind factor X with the highest affinity, weak or no binding was observed for Ad9, Ad35, Ad48, and Ad51. The hexon\u2013FX interaction has been demonstrated for multiple human Ad serotypes, showing diversity in the affinity levels. The domains and amino acid sequences in the HVRs are integral for high-affinity interaction with FX; however, several aspects of this binding and its mechanism remain uncertain (Alba et al. 2009).",

Vectors based on Ads, which normally infect nonhuman species, have also shown a great promise. These nonhuman Ad vectors have been developed from numerous species, including canine, bovine, porcine, and chimpanzee (Bangari and Mittal 2006). For example, vectors have been recently developed from chimpanzee Ads C1 or C8 (AdC). Initially AdC vectors gained attention since human sera fail to significantly neutralize them (Roy et al. 2004). Notably, unlike some other serotypes, the E1-deleted mutant of AdC7 is easily propagated in vitro (Kobinger et al. 2006). An AdC7 vector expressing the SARS coronavirus Ag elicited higher B- and T-cell responses as compared to Ad5 vector carrying the same transgene in mice with Ad5 PEI (Zhi et al. 2006). Additional promising results were seen with an AdC7 vector for another infectious disease. In this regard, a single injection of AdC7 encoding the Ebola glycoprotein provided protection from a lethal challenge, unlike the corresponding Ad5 vector (Kobinger et al. 2006).",

            "text": "It is important to note that several Ad epitopes recognized by T cells are conserved among a broad range of human and nonhuman primate-derived Ads. Therefore, it is possible that T cells in patients with Ad5 PEI will also recognize vectors derived from the alternate Ad species (Calcedo et al. 2009; Leen et al. 2004; Tang et al. 2006; Joshi et al. 2009). Since NAbs against bovine Ad3 (BAd3) have not been reported in humans, BAd3 have been evaluated for vaccine applications. In a mouse model, a single immunization of BAd3 encoding the HA Ag of H5N1 influenza induced greater levels of Ag-specific cellular immunity than the corresponding Ad5 vector, and this property was not compromised by Ad5 PEI (Singh et al. 2008). Importantly, mice with Ad5 PEI that received a prime\u2013boost regimen of BAd3-Ad5 vectors encoding HA were fully protected from lethal flu virus challenge. In contrast, mice treated by a homologous Ad5-Ad5 prime\u2013boost regimen were not protected. Consequently, Ads of nonhuman species may induce strong responses and provide immune protection comparable or superior to those of Ad5, while retaining protective potential in the presence of Ad5 PEI. The use of alternative serotype Ads thus allows for improved induction of immune responses to vector re-administration in host that have Ad5 PEI (Abbink et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009; McCoy et al. 2007). As a result of these earlier studies, alternative serotypes vectors have been now tested in patient populations for HIV vaccine development (Barouch et al. 2011). In addition, human clinical trials evaluating Ad26 as a vaccine agent against HIV have been initiated.",

One limitation of alternative Ad serotype usage is that some of them are unable to induce adequate levels of transgene expression in infected cells and are less amenable to large-scale purification (Thacker et al. 2009). With respect to Ad immune response, humans have evolved under continuous exposure of their populations to human Ad species, as opposed to Ad species infecting nonhuman hosts. Consequently, it is possible that the human system of innate immunity reacts to the capsid proteins of nonhuman Ad species in a different way. It is also plausible that the human immune system induces a more robust innate response when challenged with different xenotype or rare serotype Ads than upon exposure to Ad serotypes native to humans (hAd2/5). Recently it has been demonstrated that the innate immune response to capsid proteins of alternative serotype Ads has not only been substantially more robust as compared to Ad5 but in some cases can cause toxicity in animal models (Abbink et al. 2007; Appledorn et al. 2008; Hartman et al. 2008; Hensley et al. 2007). Alternative serotype vectors have intrinsically different tropism than Ad5 resulting in quite different biodistribution of these vectors in vivo. Over the last decade, Ad5-based vectors have been proven to be safe in humans and animals. The knowledge gained from such safety studies must be taken into account when testing chimeric or alternative serotype-based vectors.",

Genes of the Ad5 E1 and E4 regions are essential for viral replication, and the majority of Ad vectors lacking those are replication deficient (Huang and Hearing 1989; Weinberg and Ketner 1986; Jones and Shenk 1978). A substantial amount of research has been performed with replication-deficient vectors in humans and animals, showing promise in several cases (Sullivan et al. 2000). Study of replicating Ad vaccines is difficult because the host/animal model system must support Ad replication if the vaccines are to be evaluated under conditions recapitulating their intended use in humans (Deal et al. 2013). Mice do not support human Ad replication. However, Syrian hamsters (Thomas et al. 2006a), cotton rats, dogs, pigs, monkeys, and chimpanzees partially support replication of some human Ad vectors. These animals, therefore, offer fully immunocompetent model systems that can be exploited to evaluate replicating vaccines (Thomas et al. 2006a; Pacini et al. 1984; Chengalvala et al. 1991; Jogler et al. 2006; Lubeck et al. 1989; Klessig and Grodzicker 1979). While cotton rats and Syrian hamsters have been extensively utilized for evaluation of replication properties of oncolytic Ad vectors (Thomas et al. 2006a; Toth et al. 2005), dogs have been typically used to characterize Ad-based vaccines (Chengalvala et al. 1991).

After primary immunization, both chimpanzees shed vaccine virus for 6\u20137 weeks and developed Ad7-specific Abs, suggesting successful Ad7 replication in the animals. One chimpanzee developed transient seropositivity for HBsAg after prime, and both chimpanzees developed modest Ab titers after the boost immunization. A third chimpanzee primed with wt Ad7 and then boosted with rAd4HBsAg did not develop HBsAg Abs. Both rAd7/rAd4 HBsAg chimpanzees were protected from acute clinical disease, but not from infection, as evident by development of Abs against the HBV core protein in response to an HBV challenge. The animal that did not seroconvert (wtAd7/rAd4HBsAg), along with an unimmunized control, became clinically infected with HBV (Lubeck et al. 1989).",

            "text": "Vaccines against infectious diseases that have been currently licensed for use in patients include heat-inactivated or killed whole organism vaccines, microbial extracts, purified or recombinant proteins, DNA vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), or recombinant viruses. While many diseases have been controlled or essentially eradicated owing to vaccination, the goal to generate community immunity for a wide variety of diseases remains elusive due to a number of problems associated with current vaccines (Zhang et al. 2011). A substantial amount of time and research efforts are directed towards determining which strains of influenza (flu) to include in the flu vaccine each year. In most years the vaccine matches quite closely to the current disease-causing strains of flu, while sometimes, despite all of the research efforts, the vaccine is not a good match and fails to provide adequate protection (Duda 2014). Since fewer flu B cases have been identified as compared to flu A cases, there are two strains of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2, and one strain of influenza B used in the current flu vaccine. The H3N2 strain of influenza A used in the vaccine is a good match to the H3N2 strain causing the majority of flu illnesses in the United States. During the 2012/2013 flu season, there have been two illness-causing influenza B strains. One of those strains was well matched by the flu vaccine, but the other was not. Therefore, patients who were vaccinated with this season\u2019s flu vaccine are likely to be well protected, while those who happened to contract the other strain of flu B that was not part of the vaccine may not have a good protection. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the flu vaccine has been about 61 % effective at protecting people from flu during the 2013\u20132014 mid-season for all age groups (CDC 2014). This number represents quite an impressive success rate for a vaccine. However, considering the emergence of new seasonal strains, the battle against flu should continue by changing the vaccine strain composition. In this regard, the development of a universal vaccine, capable of providing a broader spectrum of protection against the disease, would greatly benefit the community and is a task of highest priority.",

            "text": "Traditional inactivated or live attenuated vaccines are fairly effective in protecting the population against seasonal flu by targeting a viral Ag, hemagglutinin (HA). However, in case of a pandemic caused by a new strain of influenza with high mortality rate in humans, such as H5N1, it is difficult to produce adequate amounts of an effective vaccine in a timely manner using the conventional egg-based production system because: (1) it takes at least 4 months to produce the first vaccine after the identification of a new potential strain (Emanuel and Wertheimer 2006); (2) H5N1 viruses are extremely lethal to personnel, requiring biosafety level 3 containment facilities for the vaccine production; and (3) H5N1 viruses do not replicate well in chicken embryos, resulting in low yield of the virus for vaccine development (Smith et al. 2008). In addition, the supply of eggs for vaccine production might be compromised during an H5N1 pandemic due to high mortality of the affected chickens. Overall, both inactivated and live attenuated H5N1 vaccines are only mildly immunogenic in humans, requiring high doses of Ag, multiple cycles of vaccination, and/or the use of adjuvants, further complicating the process (Adams and Sandrock 2010; Rockman and Brown 2010; Clayville 2011). Furthermore, the live attenuated influenza vaccine is only approved for healthy people of ages 2 through 49 and excludes high-risk populations. Generally, the licensed platforms for manufacturing of the existing seasonal influenza vaccines are not ideal for an H5N1 pandemic scenario as experienced in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (Haaheim et al. 2009). Therefore, it is urgent to explore alternative vaccine strategies for pandemic influenza, capable of preventing or controlling H5N1 infection in a timely manner. Numerous vaccine types with egg-independent production technologies, such as mammalian cell-based vaccines, recombinant protein-based vaccines, virus-like particle-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, bacterial-vectored vaccines, and viral-vectored vaccines, have been comprehensively studied as alternative options (Haaheim et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2010; Horimoto and Kawaoka 2009). Included in the list of possible alternative strategies are recombinant Ad vector H5N1 vaccines, which are promising candidates capable of inducing a rapid and long-term cross-protective immunity against frequently evolving H5N1 viruses (Tutykhina et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2009; Vemula and Mittal 2010; Toro and Tang 2009; Lambe 2012).",

The natural tropism of Ad5 vectors for the respiratory tract makes them particularly desirable for intranasal (INL) vaccination against pathogens (e.g., influenza virus) that preferentially invade the mucosa. INL immunization with Ad-based vector vaccines through the use of a nasal spray could be advantageous since immunization becomes simple, practical, economical, and well suited for mass vaccination plans. In this context, Ad-based vectors are well suited for vaccine development against influenza that infects upper respiratory track. The effectiveness of Ad-based influenza vaccines has been extensively evaluated against various influenza virus subtypes with major focus on H5N1.",

For example, parenteral administration is associated with diminished vaccine efficacy due to the presence of preexisting anti-Ad immunity. In marked contrast, vaccination via alternative routes was shown to overcome PEI against Ad5-based vectors (Van Kampen et al. 2005; Song et al. 2010; Holman et al. 2009; Appledorn et al. 2011; Xiang et al. 2003; Pandey et al. 2012). INL immunizations can overcome some effects of PEI against Ad5 vectors, inducing substantial immune response against encoded Ags and providing protection against challenge pathogens in mice, rabbits, and nonhuman primates (Xiang et al. 1996; Shi et al. 2001; Yu et al. 2008; Croyle et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2009; Richardson et al. 2011). INL and IM immunization with an Ad, expressing HA protein from A/Hong Kong/156/97 virus, has been shown to confer effective protection against lethal challenges with the heterologous (A/Hong Kong/483/97) and (A/Vietnam/1203/04) H5N1 influenza viruses in the absence of strong humoral neutralizing responses against A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus (Hoelscher et al. 2006). These studies thus demonstrate that Ad-vectored vaccines generate a robust cellular immunity against influenza that has the benefit of conferring broader protection against continuously evolving H5N1 viruses. The cellular immune response likewise plays an important role in virus clearance and promotes early recovery from infection (Thomas et al. 2006b; Lin et al. 2010).",

This suggests that Ad-based vaccination may induce secretion of Abs against conserved epitopes of the HA molecules from different strains and/or subtypes (Du et al. 2010), providing cross-protection against divergent influenza viruses. Mounting evidence suggests that Ad-based nasal influenza vaccines induce greater Ag-specific IgA and IgG responses in the respiratory tract. These vaccines could also provide more virus-specific activated T cells in the lung and better protection than IM-administered Ad vaccines (Shmarov et al. 2010; Park et al. 2009; Price et al. 2009). This is significant because mucosal immunity can potentially provide cross-protection against different strains of influenza (Hasegawa et al. 2009; Tamura et al. 2005; Ichinohe et al. 2007; Perrone et al. 2009; Lau et al. 2012; Gustin et al. 2011). More importantly, immune responses have been found in human clinical trials where human subjects could be safely and effectively immunized with Ad-vectored nasal influenza vaccines in the presence of preexisting anti-Ad5 immunity (Van Kampen et al. (2005) and data from a recent and yet unpublished Ad H5N1 nasal vaccine phase I clinical study involving 48 patients).",

However, these vaccines must circumvent several challenges before they can be considered a suitable alternative to current licensed vaccines. One major drawback that candidate vaccines must overcome before their licensure is the lack of information related to correlation between the vaccine-induced immunity and their disease protection efficacy (Madore et al. 2010). In addition, the standardization of immune assays used in the assessment of innate and adaptive immune response is essential for the comparative analysis of such vaccines. Recently, Ad5 PEI has been thought to diminish vaccine efficacy. Emerging data from clinical trials suggest that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the vaccine dose (Catanzaro et al. 2006) or by using INL route of vaccination (Van Kampen et al. 2005). However, more clinical data is needed to clarify the influence of PEI on the Ad-vectored vaccines.",

Initial efforts were focused on the development of traditional (first-generation) vaccines using inactivated or attenuated HIV virions. However, the advancements in molecular engineering and gene-based vector development have led to the emergence of viral vector-based vaccines, eliciting robust immune responses against HIV (Casimiro et al. 2003). The generation of humoral as well as cellular immunity, particularly involving CTL with long-lasting memory, is the desired features of HIV vaccines. The role and the importance of NAbs as well as CTL responses in preventing and controlling HIV infection have already been demonstrated (Sha et al. 2004). Among all viral-vectored vaccine candidates (Table 8.1), replication-defective Ad5 is the most widely used due to its proven efficacy in producing high titers of Ag-specific Abs and strong CTL responses, as well as high safety of intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) administration (McElrath and Haynes 2010; McElrath et al. 2008).",

            "text": "While the Merck vaccine was highly immunogenic, it induced only narrow responses generating a median \u22641 T-cell response per participant (McElrath et al. 2008). The HVTN 502/Step phase IIb trial was terminated after an interim analysis showing that the tested vaccine neither reduced the rate of HIV-1 incidence nor plasma viremia after infection (McElrath et al. 2008; Buchbinder et al. 2008). Extensive work has been performed to elucidate potential causes of vaccine failure. Although preliminary results suggested a reverse correlation between the natural Ad5 Ab titers and the vaccine efficacy, subsequent analyses failed to support such a correlation (Hutnick et al. 2009; O\u2019Brien et al. 2009). The results of the abovementioned vaccine trials (using two vaccines) have been extensively evaluated to determine if (1) vaccine-induced immune responses are arbitrarily distributed across vaccine inserts or clustered into immunodominant epitope hotspots; (2) the immunodominance patterns, observed in these trials, differed from each other; (3) vaccination-induced epitope hotspots overlap with those induced by a natural HIV-1 infection; (4) immunodominant hotspots correspond to the evolutionarily conserved regions of the HIV genome; and (5) epitope prediction methods can be used to identify these hotspots. It was concluded that the observed immune responses clustered into the epitope hotspots in all three vaccine trials, while some of these hotspots were not the same as in natural chronic infection. There were significant differences between the immunodominance patterns revealed in each trial. Furthermore, in some trials such differences were observed even between different groups of participants receiving the same vaccine. Some of the vaccine-induced immunodominant hotspots were found in highly variable regions of the HIV genome. The latter was most evident for the MRKAd-5 HIV vaccine. Finally, epitope prediction methods can partially estimate the region of vaccine-induced epitope hotspots. These findings have potential implications for vaccine design and suggest a framework by which different vaccine candidates can be compared in early phases of evaluation (Hertz et al. 2013). Additional post-trial data analyses would be informative for the design of effective vaccines, in general, and Ad-based HIV vaccines, in particular.",

One critical requirement for a vaccine against the plague is its ability to prevent the Y. pestis\u2019s effector proteins from entering macrophages. Because \u201cV\u201d Ag of the bacteria plays a key role in this process, an Ad-based vaccine vector (AdsecV) was designed to encode the Ag as a fusion with a signal sequence for its extracellular secretion. High anti-V IgG titers were induced in immunized mice 2 weeks following a single IM administration of the vaccine and continued to rise through 4 weeks post-immunization. A single IM dose of AdsecV protected mice from a lethal INL challenge with Y. pestis, whereas no mice were immunized with the control vector (Chiuchiolo et al. 2004). Recently the \u201cAg capsid incorporation\u201d strategy was utilized to construct vaccine vectors for protection against Y. pestis infections. Ad vectors displaying Y. pestis\u2019s V Ag or F1 capsular Ag on the capsid surface elicited a higher V- or F1-specific response, allowing boosting and better protection against a lethal challenge than that produced by vaccination with V or F1 proteins and conventional adjuvants (Boyer et al. 2010).",

The tested vaccine was comprised of four doses of recombinant canary pox priming immunogen, ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521), and two doses of AIDSVAX B/E, recombinant HIV-1 gp120 proteins from HIV-1 subtype B and circulating recombinant form 01_AE (CREF01_AE). The RV144 HIV-1 trial was the first to demonstrate evidence of protection against HIV-1 infection with an estimated vaccine efficacy of 31.2 % (Rerks-Ngarm et al. 2009). In the absence of a vaccine that can prevent HIV-1 infection, there are still many benefits to be realized from generation of a therapeutic vaccine. A therapeutic vaccine would be beneficial if it were able to increase the viral threshold titer necessary for infection, increase the time to clinical manifestation of virus, control viral load after infection, and reduce the chance of secondary transmission (McMichael 2006; Emini and Koff 2004; Thorner and Barouch 2007; Robinson and Amara 2005; Sekaly 2008; Gamble and Matthews 2010). A therapeutic HIV vaccine could induce this type of response and would invariably decrease contagiousness, the need for costly and potentially dangerous antiretroviral treatments, and the number of opportunistic infections in patients. While the effect of controlling the normal HIV-1 pathology with therapeutic vaccines would be favorable for individual patients as well as society at large, the effect of preventing HIV-1 infections in humans with a prophylactic vaccine is also broadly appealing and of the utmost importance (Beena et al. 2013).",

Immunological therapies, including therapeutic vaccines, are needed to complement drug therapy in the search for a \u201cfunctional cure\u201d for HIV. DermaVir (Genetic Immunity Kit, Budapest, Hungary and McLean, Virginia, USA), an experimental HIV/AIDS therapeutic vaccine, combines three key elements of a rational therapeutic vaccine design: a single pDNA immunogen expressing 15 HIV Ags, a synthetic pDNA nanomedicine formulation, and a DC-targeting topical vaccine administration. DermaVir alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs was evaluated in chronically SIV-infected macaques. DermaVir provided virological, immunological, and clinical benefit for SIV-infected macaques during chronic HIV infection and AIDS. In combination with antiretroviral drugs, DermaVir augmented SIV-specific T-cell responses and enhanced control of viral load rebound during treatment delays. The data also indicated the feasibility of therapeutic immunization even in immune-compromised hosts and suggested that DermaVir can supplement antiretroviral drugs to sustain suppression of HIV-1 replication (Lisziewicz et al. 2005). DermaVir\u2019s novel mechanism of action involves vaccine transportation by epidermal Langerhans cells to the lymph nodes to express the pDNA-encoded HIV Ags and induce precursor/memory T cells with high proliferation capacity. This effect has been consistently demonstrated in mouse, rabbit, primate, and human subjects. Safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of DermaVir have been clinically observed in HIV-infected human subjects. The DermaVir technology platform for DC-based therapeutic vaccination might also offer an innovative treatment paradigm for cancer and infectious diseases (Lori 2011).",

Several clinical studies using Ad vectors for cancer therapy have been conducted in the past decade. Some of those led to the clinical development of Ad vector-based products for treatment of various cancers, such as Advexin\u00ae and Gendicine\u00ae encoding wt tumor suppressor p53 under control of cytomegalovirus or Rous Sarcoma Virus promoters, respectively (Raty et al. 2008).

Briefly, the GDEPT approach utilizes the concept of foreign (bacterial or viral) enzyme-mediated intracellular conversion of nontoxic compounds (prodrugs), compatible with systemic administration, into cytotoxic metabolites capable of blocking DNA replication or transcription/protein synthesis in target (cancer) cells upon vector-mediated delivery of the foreign enzyme-encoding transgenes (\u201csuicide\u201d genes). Due to inability of cellular enzymes to use such prodrugs as substrates, the cytotoxic effect is achieved specifically in target (cancer) cells expressing the delivered therapeutic transgenes. Suppressor replacement and RNAi-based therapies represent variations of the gene therapy approach aimed at replacing mutated/inactivated tumor suppressors or disrupting tumor-promoting factors, respectively. In the former instance, a tumor suppressor gene p53 mutated in many cancer cell types is replaced by its functional (wt) counterpart, whereas in the latter instance disruption of mRNA encoding a tumor-promoting factor (hTERT, HER2, etc.) by RNAi, delivered in the context of an Ad vector, is aimed at inhibiting tumor progression. Similarly, the anti-angiogenic therapy utilizes a gene therapy approach for systemic or intratumoral delivery and expression of anti-angiogenic factors, inhibiting tumor vasculature formation and thereby growth of primary tumors and metastases (Sharma et al. 2009).",

Immunotherapy relies on preformed effector mechanisms and is well suited for the treatment of established tumors. In this context, cancer vaccines based on whole tumor cells, DCs pulsed with tumor-associated Ags (TAAs), or TAA-based subunit vaccines with immune adjuvants have recently emerged as important modalities to combat cancer.

Intravenous (IV) administration of rAd40 resulted in Msln delivery and expression in wider range of mouse organs as compared to conventional Ad5, distributed mainly to the liver, spleen, and lungs. Besides, rAd40 showed reduced levels of liver transduction or inflammatory responses, resulting in reduced liver toxicity relative to Ad5. Msln vaccination has been reported to enhance antitumor effects against Msln-expressing tumors via Msln peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunity (Hung et al. 2007; Miyazawa et al. 2011). In line with this finding, a one-time IV administration of rAd40-Msln not only prevented growth of the primary tumors in the Ag-specific manner but also blocked metastases formation, indicating that rAd40-Msln vaccination is a promising approach to stimulate both transgene- and tumor-specific immunity (Yamasaki et al. 2013).",

A replication-deficient Ad vector expressing a CRT/E7 fusion gene (Ad-CRT/E7) has been constructed to achieve higher efficiency of Ag delivery and improve Ag presentation of E7 protein through CRT. The ability of Ad-CRT/E7 to induce Ag-specific immunotherapeutic activity against E7-expressing tumors was explored in a mouse model. Vaccination with Ad-CRT/E7 induced stronger E7-specific immune responses (i.e., T-cell proliferation, IFN-\u03b3 production, and cytotoxicity) as compared to Ad vector expressing E7 alone. The Ad-CRT/E7 vector provided complete protection in mice challenged with E7-expressing TC-1 tumors and generated long-term immune memory that controlled recurrences. Most importantly, vaccination of tumor-bearing mice with Ad-CRT/E7 resulted in complete tumor regression in all tumor-bearing animals. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Ad-CRT/E7 is an effective vaccine to prevent E7-expressing cervical tumors and could potentially be clinically effective for the treatment of already established disease (Gomez-Gutierrez et al. 2007).",

Mice vaccinated with Ad5 vectors encoding HBsAg/E7 developed Ab and CTL responses against both E7 and HBsAg. However, the Ab (IgG) titers were higher for E7 than for HBsAg (Baez-Astua et al. 2005).",

However, the resulting induction of autoimmunity may present a substantial challenge to treatment of some patients. Besides, PEI to hAd2/5 in humans and efficient liver uptake can become major obstacles in hAd-based vaccination due to rapid clearance of the vector and possible toxicities. The above factors, however, can be circumvented by using vectors based on alternate Ad serotypes or nonhuman Ad species, implementation of genetic and/or chemical Ad shielding technologies, and utilization of alternate (mucosal) routes of vaccine delivery.",

            "text": "Ad-based cancer vaccines often combine delivery and expression of TAAs along with various immunostimulatory molecules, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 (Waldmann 2006; Windbichler et al. 2000; Porta et al. 2007; Robertson and Ritz 1996; Tanaka et al. 1997; Hwang et al. 2004; Wright et al. 1999; Santodonato et al. 2001; Odaka et al. 2002; Khorana et al. 2003), and various chemokines (Lapteva et al. 2009; Namkoong et al. 2014). Apart from cytokines and chemokines, certain membrane-bound receptors are also required for efficient activation of immune response. In particular, T cells following recognition of foreign Ags in context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (\u201csignal 1\u201d) require another signal (\u201csignal 2\u201d) delivered by costimulatory receptors of the CD28 and the TNFR superfamilies for activation. These two signals are then accompanied by a third signal (\u201csignal 3\u201d), in the form of cytokines. T cells receiving all three signals undergo proliferation, acquisition of effector function, and establishment of long-term memory (Lanzavecchia and Sallusto 2005). The ligands for CD28, CD80 and CD86, and TNFR\u03b1, such as 4-1BBL, OX-40L, are expressed by APCs (Choi et al. 2006; Greenfield et al. 1998; Iwakami et al. 2001; Yoshida et al. 2003; Loskog et al. 2004). Tumors, particularly those of non-hematopoietic origin, do not express costimulatory ligands and as such exploit the lack of costimulation as an effective means of immune evasion (Allison and Krummel 1995). Therefore, the use of cancer vaccines in combination with the aforementioned immune modulators has the potential to augment effector immune responses while overcoming various tumor immune evasion mechanisms for a pronounced antitumor immune response with clinical benefits (Putzer et al. 1997; Choi et al. 2006; Habib-Agahi et al. 2007).",

Conditionally replicating Ad (CRAd) vectors proved to be a powerful tool for tumor regression not only due to their direct lytic effect on infected cancer cells but also to the immune responses against TAAs, released upon CRAd-mediated oncolysis and naturally presented to immune system by macrophages and DCs at the site of tumor destruction. Thus, replicative Ad vectors, especially oncolytic vectors \u201carmed\u201d with transgenes encoding immunomodulatory factors, play an important role as adjuvant components of therapeutic cancer vaccines. It should be noted, however, that expressing TAAs in the context of highly potent oncolytic Ads may not be always an optimal vaccination strategy because of potentially short duration of transgene expression in the CRAd-infected cells due to the rapidly developing cytopathic effect leading to oncolytic cell destruction. Furthermore, attempts have been made to augment the immunotherapeutic potential of oncolytic Ads by vector incorporation of heat shock proteins as transgenes. Since heat shock proteins act as chaperones facilitating protein folding and translocation, their overexpression in cancer cells augments adaptive antitumor T-cell immunity by stimulating the processing and presentation of TAAs to T cells via APCs (Wang et al. 2001, 2006).",

            "text": "Ad-based vaccines can be used in conjunction with APCs, particularly with DCs. DCs are highly efficient \u201cprofessional\u201d APCs that process and load intracellularly expressed TAAs onto both MHC I and MHC II molecules, thus allowing appropriate and relatively persistent induction of Ag-specific CD8+ as well as CD4+ T-cell responses. Ad vectors have been extensively used to transduce and modify DCs, either for effective TAA delivery and presentation to effector T cells or for their activation, i.e., induction of DC-mediated Ag-specific immune responses. Upon activation DCs migrate to the draining lymph nodes (LNs) and simultaneously upregulate costimulatory molecules and cytokines to prime both T helpers (Th) and CTLs in paracortical areas of LNs (Fig. 8.4). DCs thus provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity. A number of studies have demonstrated that ex vivo transduction of DCs with Ad vectors encoding TAAs and their expression in DCs results in induction of antitumor immunity upon DC inoculation back in tumor-bearing animals (Xia et al. 2006). Immune activation of DCs can be induced by delivering immunostimulatory factors or by genetic modification of the Ad5 capsid fiber protein (Worgall et al. 2004), for instance, with CD40 ligand, which binds to CD40 receptor, highly expressed on DCs (Fig. 8.4) (Belousova et al. 2003). Besides, Ad5 vectors exhibit adjuvant effect on their own and are capable of inducing DC activation and maturation upon transduction (Geutskens et al. 2000; Kanagawa et al. 2008).\n",

            "text": "In order to infectivity-enhance/retarget Ad vectors for/to DCs, a number of fiber-modification strategies have been developed. These can be classified into genetic, nongenetic (bi-specific adapter based), and a new strategy combining the two. The genetic strategies (Table 8.2) introduce modifications in the Ad5 fiber protein C-terminal knob domain by: (1) incorporation of short peptide ligands (RGD4C, pK7), (2) knob-swap between different Ad serotypes (Ad5/3, Ad5/35 fiber chimeras), or (3) whole knob replacement by artificial fusion molecules embodying the essential fiber trimerization motif and a receptor-binding motif (see also Table 8.2). This motif could be in the form of: (1) a targeting ligand (CD40L) (Belousova et al. 2003), (2) an Fc-binding domain of the Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Korokhov et al. 2003), (3) a single-chain Ab (scFv) (Hedley et al. 2006a), or (4) an affibody molecule with a given Ag-binding specificity (Belousova et al. 2008). Fiber incorporation of the Ad3 or Ad35 knobs or the CD40L has been shown to improve DC transduction efficiency, allowing selective delivery of Ags in vitro and in vivo using a human skin explant model (van de Ven et al. 2009; de Gruijl et al. 2006). The adapter-based strategies utilize engineered bi-specific fusion molecules bridging Ad capsid protein fiber and the targeted receptor on DCs (see Fig. 8.4). There are two types of engineered bivalent adapters for targeting CD40 receptor. The first type is represented by a chemically conjugated bi-specific Ab consisting of a Fab fragment of the Ad5 fiber knob-specific Ab \u201c1D6.14\u201d and anti-CD40 monoclonal Ab (mAb) \u201cG28-5\u201d (Tillman et al. 1999). The second type is a recombinant fusion between a soluble CAR (sCAR) and the CD40-specific, G28-5 mAb-derived single-chain Ab (scFv) (Pereboev et al. 2002; Hangalapura et al. 2012). Subsequently the latter adapter was improved by fusing CAR with CD40L via a trimerization motif-containing linker (Pereboev et al. 2004). The \u201ccombined\u201d strategy utilizes a genetically modified fiber, fused to the S. aureus protein A Fc-binding domain (see above) in conjunction with a protein-fusion adapter, composed of Fc-binding domain portion of the human IgG1 fused to a CD40-specific scFv, derived from the G28-5 anti-CD40 Ab. This bi-specific adapter can bridge the fiber-modified Ad particles with the CD40 receptors on DCs (Korokhov et al. 2003). A similar strategy was used to target Ad5 to DCs via a DC-specific receptor DC-SIGN (Korokhov et al. 2005).",

The authors found that priming with a DC-based vaccine induced a long-lasting CTL response in wt mice, while homologous boosting better sustained the pool of central memory T cells associated with potent protection against B16F1 melanoma challenge. Appropriate timing of booster vaccination was also critical. Conversely, prime\u2013boost vaccination proved to be of no advantage or even detrimental in therapeutic settings in B16F1 and transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) models, respectively. These results indicate that booster vaccinations impact antitumor immunity to different extents, depending on their application (prophylactic or therapeutic), and suggest evaluating the need for boosting in any given cancer patient depending on the state of the disease (Ricupito et al. 2013).",

A variety of TAAs delivered to DCs via an Ad vector have been shown to boost immune responses to tumor cells (Gallo et al. 2005; Xia et al. 2006). Replication-deficient recombinant Ads, encoding human gp100 or MART-1 melanoma Ag, were used to transduce human DCs ex vivo in model systems for cancer vaccine therapy. Vector-transduced DCs stimulated MART-1(27-35)- or gp100-specific tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes to produce IFN-\u03b3 and induced the peptides-specific, MHC class I-restricted CTLs within PBL from normal donors in vitro (Butterfield et al. 1998; Linette et al. 2000). Furthermore, a protective response to a lethal tumor challenge of unmodified murine B16 melanoma cells was observed upon vaccination of immunocompetent mice with bone marrow-derived murine DCs transduced with AdVMART-1 vector (Ribas et al. 2000). Genetic immunization using DCs transduced ex vivo with an hAd5 expressing the HER2/neu gene has also been demonstrated to induce CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-based immunity against a breast tumor cell line overexpressing HER2/neu (Chen et al. 2001).",

The protective effect of AdIL-12/AdE7 combination was significantly more profound than that of each vaccine alone and also resulted in regression of 9 mm-sized tumors in approximately 80 % of the experimental animals as compared to the \u201cno vector\u201d control group. Serum levels of E7-specific Ab and INF-\u03b3 production as well as T helper cell-proliferative responses were found to be significantly higher in mice coinfected with AdIL-12 and AdE7 than in experimental groups receiving injection of either AdIL-12 or AdE7 vaccines.

These authors used a recombinant hAd encoding VE-cad, a transmembrane glycoprotein located at junctions between endothelial cells. VE-cad (VEc) is the most endothelial cell-specific cadherin that plays a critical role in regulating the process of normal and pathological angiogenesis (Vestweber 2008; Hendrix et al. 2001; Liao et al. 2002). To enhance Ag delivery to DC and macrophages, the recombinant AdVEc virus was coupled ex vivo with mannan under oxidizing conditions. Mannose receptors (MRs, CD206), a new family of multilectin receptor proteins, are the most ubiquitous receptors expressed on APCs, including DCs and macrophages. In addition to its role as a DC-targeting ligand, oxidized mannan coupled with Ad particles could act as an immunologic adjuvant, contributing to the ability of mature DCs to generate primary T-cell responses (Zhao et al. 2011). Vaccination with AdVEc\u2013mannan complex (AdVEc-m) suppressed tumor angiogenesis and reduced density of tumor vasculature, resulting in both prophylactic and therapeutic effects on tumor growth and prolongation of mouse survival.

All vaccine combinations tested could provide significant tumor growth delay. While DCh5T4 prime\u2013Adh5T4 boost regimen was the best for tumor prophylaxis, it did not demonstrate any therapeutic efficacy in mice with established tumors. In contrast, Adh5T4 prime\u2013DCh5T4 boost vaccination was the best regimen for tumor therapy. The authors concluded that prior immunization with Adh5T4 can condition the mice to induce 5T4-specific Th1 immune responses, which can be sustained and subsequently boosted with DCh5T4. In contrast, prior immunization with DCh5T4 augments Th2 immune responses (already induced by B16h5T4 tumor growth itself), such that a subsequent vaccination with Adh5T4 cannot elicit tumor regression, whose success is dependent on altering the polarizing immune responses from Th2 to Th1. Interestingly, depletion of CD25+ Tregs after tumor challenge, but before immunization, restored therapeutic efficacy (Ali et al. 2007).",

A mouse model of prostate cancer was developed by the authors through generating clonal derivatives of the mouse RM-1 prostate cancer cell line expressing human PSMA. To maximize Ag presentation by DCs, expression of both MHC class I and TAP proteins was induced in RM-1 cells by transduction with another Ad vector encoding IFN-\u03b3 (Ad5-IFN\u03b3). Administering hPSMA-expressing DCs as well as direct intraperitoneal injection of the Ad5-hPSMA vector resulted in high levels of tumor-specific CTL responses against RM-1-PSMA cells pretreated with Ad5-IFN\u03b3. The CD40 targeting significantly improved the therapeutic antitumor efficacy of the PSMA-encoding Ad vector when combined with Ad5-IFN\u03b3 in the mouse model of human prostate cancer (RM-1-PSMA) (Williams et al. 2012). Some of those strategies have been evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials summarized in Table 8.3.\n",

An example of such contemporary cancer vaccine-based therapy is the recently FDA-approved first ever vaccine for therapy of cancer called sipuleucel-T also known under commercial name of Provenge\u00ae (Dendreon, Inc.). Although formulation of this vaccine does not involve Ad-based gene delivery, it is important to mention here with regard to the underlying approach the clinical outcomes and historical significance of the treatment approval. This cell-based vaccine is created by isolating APCs from individual patient\u2019s peripheral blood mononuclear cells and culturing them with a fusion protein called PA2024, consisting of PAP prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP; an Ag that is expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells but not on non-prostate tissues), linked to cytokine GM-CSF (PAP-GM-CSF). APCs cultured in the presence of PAP-GM-CSF display increased amounts of costimulatory molecules on their surface and constitute the active component of sipuleucel-T. These activated APCs are eventually infused back into the APC donor patient for treatment. In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, sipuleucel-T increased the overall survival of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients by 4 months, however failed to induce tumor regression. Although the exact therapeutic mechanism remains elusive, the treatment appears to favor older patients. On the downside, the underlying personalized approach makes the treatment laborious, technically complex, and extremely expensive (Small et al. 2006; Gulley and Drake 2011).",

In the past 20 years, recombinant Ad vectors expressing a variety of Ags have been constructed and tested for immunization in various settings. However, Ad infection induces pathogenic inflammatory responses in immunocompetent hosts, including humans, even if the viral vector does not replicate, as early Ad gene expression alone is responsible for the pathogenic reaction. The inflammation consists of an early phase, in which TNF-\u03b1 plays a major role and a late phase consisting of an extensive T-cell response (Ginsberg 1996; Imler 1995). In addition, PEI to Ads is a major impediment for vectors derived from common human serotypes, such as 5 or 2. Preexisting NAbs against these serotypes can be found in up to 90 % of human adults depending on age and geographic region (Chen et al. 2010). Preexisting NAbs limit Ad-delivered transgene expression, thereby reducing the immune efficacy of the vaccine to the target Ag. A series of approaches have been entertained to circumvent the negative impact of preexisting NAbs, which include genetic modifications of Ad vectors or the use of those isolated from different species, such as chimpanzees (Fitzgerald et al. 2003). Another strategy to avoid vector PEI is to genetically alter the natural tropism of the vector to improve its selective targeting to CD40 receptor on DCs in situ, thus making generation of autologous DCs more efficient and inexpensive (Hangalapura et al. 2012).",

Nasal administration of Ad vectors encoding Ags derived from selected pathogens not only provides a painless and practical means of immunization but also generates rapid and sustained protection against the pathogens. Importantly, Ad particles alone without transgene expression were shown to induce an anti-influenza state in the airway. Ad-vectored vaccines can also be used for mass immunization of animals with important application to veterinary medicine (Zhang et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, virus chimera technologies have boosted the development of novel therapeutic Ads for applications in gene therapy and oncolysis. These strategies of developing virus chimerism address the most relevant drawbacks to clinical implementation of virus-based therapies, including those that have been identified very recently such as blood coagulation factor-mediated liver tropism of Ads (Waddington et al. 2008; Kalyuzhniy et al. 2008). Safety and increased therapeutic efficiency in clinical settings have already been demonstrated by several chimeric Ads (Koski et al. 2010; Pesonen et al. 2010). All these new insights and developments led to a high number of possible combinatorial treatment modalities and delivery schemes. This calls for careful preclinical evaluation in relevant ex vivo human models and transitional in vivo tumor models, before clinical translation. To bring optimized combinations of retargeted Ad configurations and adjuvants in optimized heterologous prime\u2013boost schedules to the clinic will be a major effort both in terms of time and cost (de Gruijl and van de Ven 2012). We consider that the most promising approaches to Ad-based immune response are (1) incorporation of heterologous Ag into Ad capsid, (2) a DC-targeted Ad vaccines, and (3) an oncolytic Ads armed with both Ag and immunomodulatory transgenes. Therefore, it is reasonable to view certain properties and components of the immune system as allies, rather than enemies, taking advantage of them for improving efficacy of cancer and other disease-targeted vaccines. In this regard, by making a part of the solution what has previously been viewed as a problem, we expect to observe more Ad-based cancer vaccines achieving clinical efficacy in the years to come.",

Ad-based vaccines can be targeted to CD40 receptor expressed on DCs via an Ad5 fiber genetic modification or bi-specific conjugate/adapter molecules or combination thereof. In the ex vivo approach, patient-isolated DCs are transduced with Ad vaccines in a clinical laboratory settings and treated with maturation factors before infusing back into the patient. For in vivo vaccination, retargeted Ad-vectored vaccines with genetically modified fiber and/or complexed with adapter is injected intradermally into the patient to target DCs in their natural environment. This leads to antigen uptake by DCs and maturation and migration to lymph nodes where DCs activate T cells for the generation of CTL responses",
