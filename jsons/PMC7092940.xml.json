Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments were conducted on a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. An An60Ti rotor and standard six-sector equilibrium centerpieces were used. The freshly prepared wild-type and mutational SARS 3CL proteinase was further purified and buffer-exchanged using a gel filtration column, Superdex 75 10/300 GL (Amersham Bioscience), into sedimentation buffer (40 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.3). The molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (1.04 mg/cm2), density of the sedimentation buffer (1.005 g/ml), partial specific volume (0.723 ml/g), and molecular weight of the monomer (33 914 Da) were calculated based on its amino acid composition using the program SEDNTERP (http://www.bbri.org/rasmb/rasmb.html). For sedimentation velocity experiments, 380 \u03bcl samples (concentrations between 0.1 and 4 mg/ml) and 400 \u03bcl reference solutions were loaded into cells. The rotor temperature was equilibrated at 20 \u00b0C and rotor speeds of 60,000 rpm. Absorbance scans at 230, 280 or 290 nm were collected at a time interval of 4 min. Data were analyzed with the software Sedfit version 8.9 g [28], [29]. For the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, 110 \u03bcl samples and 120 \u03bcl reference solutions were loaded into nitrogen-flushed cells, followed by degassing and a further nitrogen flush prior to sealing. The protein was equilibrated for data collection at 20 \u00b0C and three rotor speeds (15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 rpm). Once equilibrium was reached (typically 24\u201332 h), absorption data were collected at 280 nm, using a radial step size of 0.001 cm, and recorded as the average of 10 measurements at each radial position. To determine the baseline values in the cell, at the end of the data collection time the rotor speed was increased to 42,000 rpm for 8 h, and the absorbance of the depleted meniscus was measured. Dissociation constants were determined by fitting a monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium model using the Origin-based data analysis software for Beckman XL-A/XL-I (Beckman Instruments, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Data from different concentrations and speeds were combined for global fitting.",

Sedimentation velocity provides hydrodynamics information about the molecular size distribution and conformational changes, whereas sedimentation equilibrium can perfectly characterize the thermodynamics of the self-association systems and determine the dissociation constants [30], [31]. Recently, Peter Schuck has developed a method for the analysis of protein self-association by sedimentation velocity experiments [29], [32]. In order to get a reliable result, we performed both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments to determine the dissociation constant of SARS 3CL proteinase.

Our experiments showed that the N-finger deletion mutant \u03947N could not form any dimer (Fig. 3\nB), which agrees with the previous report that the N-finger deletion mutant is in monomeric form in solution [35]. However, the seven residues in the N-finger contribute differently to the dimer stability. From Fig. 4\n, we can see that the side chains of Phe-3 and Lys-5 point away from the dimer interface to the interior of the same monomer. Ser-1, Gly-2, and Ala-7 do not have remarkable interactions. The two most important residues among the seven are Arg-4 and Met-6. The guanidyl group of Arg-4 in one monomer forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu-290 in the other monomer, which is one of the major interactions between the two monomers. Furthermore, the side chain of Met-6 forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of the Phe-140 and Tye-126 in its partner. This suggests that residues Arg-4 and Met-6 are the two possible key residues for the N-finger role in dimer stability. However, Chou et al. [33] reported that the mutation of R4A only partly affects the dimerization of SARS 3CL proteinase and keeps most enzymatic activity, which means that Arg-4 might not be the dominating factor to the dimer interface. In this study, R4E and M6A mutants were shown to have very weak dimerization according to sedimentation experiments (Figs. 3C and E) and have no detectable enzyme activity either (Table 1\n). Substituting the positively charged Arg-4 with a negatively charged Glu makes it impossible to form a salt bridge with the Glu-290 in the other monomer and even cause charge repulsion. The mutation of M6A suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between the side chain of Met-6 and Phe-140, Tye-126 in the other monomer contribute significantly to the stability of the dimer.",

The N-finger of one monomer is important for the enzyme activity of the other monomer [15], [16]. So it is easy to understand the phenomenon of no dimer, no activity. The mutation of R4A kept most of the enzymic activity and did not affect the dimerization severely [33], which means that the electrostatic interaction contributed by the salt bridge between Arg-4 and Glu-290 may not be vital to the dimerization. However, the alanine substitution of Met-6 would be lethal to the dimer. In fact, Arg-4 is not conserved and can be substituted by lysine or valine in several other coronavirus 3CL proteinases, while Met-6 is highly conserved with Leu substitution in very few cases [15]. As a single Met-6 to Ala mutation makes the enzyme to be mostly a monomer with no detectable activity, the hydrophobic effect of Met-6 should play a key role in the dimerization. Since dimerization of SARS 3CL proteinase is necessary for the enzyme activity, the interface of the dimer may be used as a new target for structure-based drug design [18], [19]. From the N-terminal mutational analysis, we propose that a hydrophobic group and an acidic moiety that can form strong hydrogen bonds with ARG-4 are essential to design strong dimer interface binding inhibitors.",

Dimerization inhibitors are easily identified using the Zhang\u2013Poorman plot as they provide lines that are parallel with that from the protease alone, while competitive and non-competitive inhibitors give non-parallel lines [36]. Zhang\u2013Poorman plot has been successfully applied in many protease dimerization inhibitor studies [20], [23], [25], [27], [36]. Fig. 5\nshows that the line in the presence of 0.8 mM peptide N8 is parallel with that in the absence of inhibitor.

Since the N-finger fragment adopts an extended conformation in the crystal structure, the side chain of Lys-5 points outwards to the dimer interface and does not participate in the enzyme dimerization. The mutation of Lys-5 to Ala (peptide N83) only slightly decreases the inhibiting activity of the N-finger fragment, indicating that Lys-5 contributes little to the inhibitor binding. However, in peptide N86, the peptide backbone may turn around with the Lys-5 taking the place of Arg-4 and interacting with the enzyme, due to the loss of the conformation restriction offered originally by Arg-4 and Met-6. This is confirmed by the triple-mutation peptide N87, which shows little inhibition activity.",

The Met-6 residue was found to be essential for maintaining the dimer structure, while Arg-4 contributed less. The N-finger octapeptide N8 has been synthesized and confirmed to be a dimerization inhibitor with a K\ni of 2.20 mM. Several N8 peptide mutants were also synthesized and tested for their inhibition activity. The hydrophobic interaction of Met-6 and the electrostatic interaction of Arg-4 in N8 play important roles in inhibitor binding. Peptide N8 is the first inhibitor designed to target the dimeric interface of coronavirus 3CL proteinase. Our current study provides a novel strategy for drug design against SARS and other coronaviruses.",
