According to the Ethics Committee of the University of C\u00f3rdoba, the bats were treated with analgesics and anesthetics. Blood samples were taken and then euthanized to obtain tissues and organs which were preserved in liquid N2 at \u2212196\u00b0C. A portion of each organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the detection of antigens by immunohistochemistry. Several pathological anatomy analyses were performed to determine the histological characteristics of tissue lesions of frugivorous bats naturally infected with the VEEV.",

The outbreaks have been registered for decades in countries with enzootic circulation. The implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with previously unknown VEEV activity. The enzootic Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.13/March-2020/15.pdf subtypes of VEEV are frequently detected and isolated in habitats where they circulate in rodent reservoirs and mosquitoes. The main reservoirs are rodents of wild species of Oryzomys, Zigodontomys, Heteromys, Peromyscus, and Proechimys. These animals become infected and develop viremia that is sufficient to infect the vectors [9, 10] . Different studies have reported evidence of VEEV infection, suggesting that bats (frugivorous, sanguinivorous, and insectivorous) could be host to arboviruses of public health impact in America [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Clinically, VEEV is indistinguishable from dengue and other arboviral diseases, often humans infected with VEEV symptoms appear within 2-5 days, and range from febrile, or flu-like symptoms, such as malaise, fever, chills, and myalgia, to coma and death are registered in ~1% of cases [3] . The confirmatory diagnosis requires specialized laboratory tests that are difficult to afford in regions with limited economic incomes.",

Although in the bats captured in this investigation, no apparent neurological symptoms were observed that were related to VEEV, a diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate was found in the brain with neuronal necrosis and multifocal vasculitis detected by histopathological diagnosis compatible with non-suppurative encephalitis of viral type, these presumptive lesions of encephalitis were confirmed by specific labeling of VEEV antigens.",

The mechanisms for the maintenance of arboviruses are intrinsically complicated and must be taken into account and incorporated when designing and constructing mathematical models that allow predicting their enzootic/ epidemic activity in a given ecosystem (wild, urban, and agricultural, as well). Consequently, to better understand the activity pattern and the transmission networks of arboviruses, it is essential to understand the assembly of host species and vectors, their interactions, and fluctuations through time and space. Although the natural infection rate found in this study by molecular methods is low (0.2%), it poses the challenge of being able to complement surveillance with serological detection to establish the presence of the virus in regions where the disease is absent in humans. The role of naturally infected frugivorous bats is challenging due to the short period during which these infected animals \"could be viremic,\" and the serological detection of specific immunoglobulin offers the most effective means of confirming it.",
