The colors are used to designate triage categories, initial cat temperament, and other conditions that determine placement and housing within the shelter. In addition, this system serves to establish the examination sequence. The assignment of color categories may vary with each case based on the availability of the color devices used (Table 69-2\n). Colored duct tape is easily used and readily purchased at home improvement, hardware, office supply, and general merchandise stores. Colored flagging tape may also be used but poses a risk of animal ingestion and can be difficult to remove from transport carriers or cages. A piece of the appropriate colored duct tape is placed on the animal identification (ID) label located on the transport carrier or cage; some animals may have more than one color assigned (Figure 69-1\n). The primary use of the color system is at the scene, but some colors may continue to be used within the sheltering system. The color system and their assigned categories should be posted at the scene, within each forensic examination area, and at multiple areas within the shelter.",

Every consideration should be made to minimize stress during removal, transport, sheltering, and examination of the cats. Physical handling of the cats and change of environment are additional but necessary stressors in these cases that carry a risk of exacerbating any pre-existing medical conditions. It is not unusual for these large groups of cats to be subclinical disease carriers that have reached a state of homeostasis that when disrupted results in new outbreaks. In addition, many of these cases involve animals that lack proper socialization and/or have been under severe emotional stress. They may exhibit aggression (due to fear or pain), or they may be completely unable to interact. Some cats may exhibit subtle behavioral clues of extreme distress. It is the initial handling at the scene that can set the animal up for success or failure more so than any setbacks that may occur during examination or sheltering.",

If possible, it is preferable to take several hours to remove a cat from the scene rather than forcefully remove it, which can reinforce the animal's fear and behavioral response. It is important to recognize that these cats may have reactions to novel stimuli different from those raised as pets in private homes. Therefore, any negative behavioral designations assigned at the scene should be considered temporary and only for the purpose of cautionary handling. The key to successful handling of animals involves the accurate appraisal of behavior, an adequate number of staff, and the appropriate equipment; proper training in each of these areas being the most important aspect.",

Individual transport carriers should be of sturdy construction, put together properly to prevent animal escape or injury, have adequate ventilation, and consist of a design that allows stacking of carriers. Special areas may need to be designated at the offloading area for animals requiring immediate veterinary care or assessment upon arrival to the shelter, especially neonates.

This requires creating a temporary shelter, which follows the same principles used for animal disaster sheltering, with the primary difference that the animals are evidence in a criminal case. Protocols must be in place for monitoring, treatment, daily assessment, and progress documentation, including change of medical or behavioral status. There should be a shelter mapping system to identify and track the location of every animal, including when animals are moved. It is important to have the veterinarian's input on the initial design and any adjustments made based on the crime scene assessment or forensic examinations. The shelter should be designed to be flexible based on changing medical or behavioral conditions of the animals. Shelter design should take into account the number of cats, special housing needs, ease of handling, infectious disease, temperature control, airflow, foot traffic, noise levels, animal stress, and environmental enrichment. Continued assessment and reassessment of cat behavior and temperament should be conducted, with changes made to address any issues noted. Any final behavior or temperament designations should only be assigned after the cats have had time to adjust to their new environment and recover from all stressors, which may take several days to weeks.",

Often these cases involve group housing or free-roaming shelter settings, and the temporary shelter results in isolation of cats into individual cages. Although this can be another stressor on the cats, it can be offset (at least for the short term) by the positive change to a sanitary environment and the elimination of competition for resources of space, litter, food, and water. Cats should be paired or group-housed whenever possible and practical to reduce stress. Shy or feral cats are often less stressed when paired with another cat. Wire cages are especially amenable to alteration, creating a \u201cdouble-wide\u201d space for this purpose. Environmental enrichment is important to incorporate into the sheltering design and protocols. This includes soft bedding, boxes, or small carriers to hide in, toys, treats, and catnip. It is critical to offer canned food, especially for cats with upper respiratory or dental disease, to assess and stimulate appetite, and for further enrichment. It is important to minimize changing of bedding and other items within the cages, which can create additional stress.3 The use of synthetic pheromones (e.g., Feliway, Ceva Animal Health) may be effective in stress reduction when sprayed on bedding and through the use of plug-in diffusers.4, 5 Whenever possible, the same persons should care for the same cats to help reduce stress, enhance opportunities for socialization, and decrease risk for injuries.

These separations are often based on infectious diseases, zoonotic diseases, critical medical observation, bite quarantine, reproductive status, and special needs (such as those cats that are difficult to handle, pregnant, neonates, or nursing). Decisions for separate housing areas must be done with consideration of the crime scene assessment. Most of these cases involve cats that have previously been exposed to each other either through housing design or fomite transmission; therefore, separation based on infectious disease is neither necessary nor recommended. In large open shelters, separate areas can be created by hanging tarps or clear plastic sheets that are open at the ceiling for airflow. Other considerations for housing of cats include lighting, number of separate rooms, secure areas, and airflow. Cats are more stressed when at ground level, so every effort should be made to elevate the housing.3\n",

Fecal testing is not necessary unless there is unresolved diarrhea after deworming, or it is otherwise dictated based on clinical illness. Coccidiosis is a common finding in large-scale cat cruelty cases; it is found in up to 23% of cats with diarrhea and 33% of clinically healthy cats.9 Based on observed diarrhea findings at the scene, within the temporary shelter, or diagnostic test results, it may be reasonable to treat all cats for coccidiosis. Ponazuril is an effective treatment for coccidiosis and is easily administered to large numbers of cats, given orally once daily at 15 to 30 mg/kg for 1 to 3 days and repeated if necessary in 1 week.3, 10 The stressors the cats have been exposed to along with dietary changes at the temporary shelter can contribute to diarrhea.

For each test considered, both the test itself and the action to be taken based on its result must be appropriate and reasonable. In a large-scale case, tests that may be recommended or conducted in private or shelter medicine practice may not be appropriate or reasonable. The goal is not to cure all animals and eliminate all pathogens prior to the cat leaving the temporary shelter, rather it is to immediately identify and address any important medical issues, improve overall physical and mental health, and address any obvious zoonotic issues. This should be a clear and constant guidepost for decisions made. It cannot and should not be the expectation to test and treat for everything. As with any shelter situation, these cats may be asymptomatic carriers of a variety of pathogens. Testing can result in information that is not currently relevant to the health of the animal yet force decisions for unnecessary and inappropriate actions for that individual animal or the general population.",

Loss of normal hair color and hair keratinization abnormalities can occur. In cats, decreased melanin deposition due to amino acid deficiencies results in a reddish cast to the hairs, sometimes called red coat (Figure 69-8\n). Erythema or crusting in areas of friction or stretching, such as in the distal extremities, may be found.
