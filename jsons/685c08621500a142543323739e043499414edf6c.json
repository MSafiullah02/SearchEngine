Data driven approaches might supply information to support the implementation of mitigation and suppression strategies. To facilitate research in this direction, we present a machine-readable dataset that aggregates relevant data from governmental, journalistic, and academic sources on the county level. In addition to county-level time-series data from the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dashboard [1], our dataset contains more than 300 variables that summarize population estimates, demographics, ethnicity, housing, education, employment and income, climate, transit scores, and healthcare system-related metrics. Furthermore, we present aggregated out-of-home activity information for various points of interest for each county, including grocery stores and hospitals, summarizing data from SafeGraph [2]. By collecting these data, as well as providing tools to read them, we hope to aid researchers investigating how the disease spreads and which communities are best able to accommodate stay-at-home mitigation efforts.",

After this, we must balance reducing the risk of spread with the adverse economic consequences of millions of furloughed and unemployed people. To inform this process, we have curated a machine-readable dataset that aggregates data from governmental, journalistic, and academic sources on the county level. While most of these sources are freely available, there is significant work to align them and put them in a standard format that enables analysis. In addition to time-series data from [1], which details COVID-19 per-county infections and deaths, our dataset contains more than 300 variables that summarize population estimates, demographics, ethnicity, housing, education, employment and income, climate, transit scores, and healthcare system-related metrics. Further, we source a significant number of journal articles detailing implementation dates of interventions, including stay-at-home orders, school closures, and restaurant and entertainment venue closures [10]- [48] . Finally, we aggregate out-of-home activity data from [2] in each county, possibly measuring compliance with the aforementioned restrictions. Fig. 1 shows a sample of out-of-home activity for selected counties.. We hope that this dataset proves to be a useful resource to the community, facilitating important research on epidemiological forecasting. In particular, a machine learning approach to identify highly relevant factors may inform a graduated rollback of isolation measures and travel restrictions.",

At the time of this writing, efforts to improve the availability of COVID-19 tests are ongoing, but the current strategies prioritize patients with severe symptoms. Thus, modeling efforts may wish to take into account random subsampling of the true population, where untested individuals still spread the virus. This is especially true given that nearly half of all COVID-19 infections may be asymptomatic [72] . Fig. 3 shows the infections in King County, WA collected by [1].

If that happens too quickly, it will completely overwhelm our healthcare system. The number of individuals who will ultimately be infected-and the number of deaths that will result-depend on the interventions reinforced now. At the same time, the economic impact of these interventions, which is not evenly distributed across counties, cannot be ignored. It depends on the characteristic qualities of each area-very different, for example, New York as opposed to Silicon Valley. The former has a large population in the entertainment and service industries, which will need financial support during quarantine, whereas the latter is dominated by large tech firms, whose employees can adapt to working from home. By providing the socioeconomic attributes of each county, the spread of COVID-19 confirmed cases, and the ongoing response in a machine-readable format, we hope to inform the decisions made to most effectively protect each area.",
