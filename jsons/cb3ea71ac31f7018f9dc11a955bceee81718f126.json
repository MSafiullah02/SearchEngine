This study evaluated the association between the detection of multiple viruses by RT-PCR and disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. Methods: Children less than 2 years of age with clinical symptoms of bronchiolitis were prospectively included during three winter seasons. Patients were categorized in three groups based on disease severity; mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Multiplex RT-PCR of 15 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: In total, 142 samples were obtained. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected virus (73%) followed by rhinovirus (RV) (30%). In 58 samples (41%) more than one virus was detected, of which 41% was a dual infection with RSV and RV. In RSV infected children younger than 3 months, disease severity was not associated with the number of detected viruses. Remarkably, in children older than 3 months we found an association between more severe disease and RSV mono-infections. Conclusion: Disease severity in children with bronchiolitis is not associated with infection by multiple viruses.

Our main finding was that the detection of more than one virus is not associated with increased disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. These findings debate the cumulative effect of the detection of a certain virus on disease severity during co-infection.

The amount of multiple infections (41%) in this study is consistent with current literature. 5, 10, 11 However, in 97% of our samples at least one virus was detected which is high compared to other studies. 15, 16 This may be explained by the inclusion period between November and April in which virus activity as reflected in the number of respiratory tract infections is highest in The Netherlands in combination with strict inclusion criteria of bronchiolitis. Furthermore, RT-PCR is a sensitive method to detect viruses. As the detection of a virus by RT-PCR does not necessarily mean that it causes symptoms, the presence of a virus, RV particularly, has to be interpreted carefully.

To date there has been little agreement on the effect of viral co-infection on disease severity in children with bronchiolitis in which both RSV and RV are detected. Papadopoulos et al. 13 demonstrated that the presence of RV in children with RSV bronchiolitis increased the risk for severe disease approximately five times. Although this study was supported by another study that also described dual viral infection as a relevant risk factor for intensive care admission, 23 others did not find an additional effect of RSV/RV dual infections on disease severity compared to RSV single infections. 15, 24 RSV has been described as the most common pathogen causing bronchiolitis and is associated with increased disease severity in young children and in those with underlying diseases. 24, 25 In our study, children with RSV mono-infections suffered from most severe disease. The young age of the children in the most severe group may have caused a bias in our results, since young age is a well-known risk factor for severe RSV infection. This is supported by our findings that demonstrate that children with severe symptoms upon viral infection are younger than children with milder manifestations of viral infection.
