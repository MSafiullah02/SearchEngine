            "text": "Species diversity in the Philippines is intrinsically linked to the geological history of the region (Heaney, 1985; Brown & Diesmos, 2001 (2002), 2009). The Philippine archipelago formed during the last 15 Myr as continental plate movement and volcanism caused the emergence of multiple large oceanic islands (Hall, 1998). During low sea\u2010level stands of the Pleistocene, islands separated by shallow channels were connected by land allowing for faunal and floral range expansion through dispersion and dispersal (Fig. 1: Brown & Guttman, 2002; Roberts, 2006a, 2006b). These connected islands are often referred to as Pleistocene aggregate island complexes (PAICs). Species are commonly endemic to a single PAIC, although some species span multiple PAICs. Sphenomorphus atrigularis, Sphenomorphus beyeri, Sphenomorphus boyingi, Sphenomorphus diwata, Sphenomorphus hadros, Sphenomorphus igorotorum, Sphenomorphus kitangladensis, Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus, Sphenomorphus lawtoni, Sphenomorphus leucospilos, Sphenomorphus luzonensis, Sphenomorphus tagapayo, Sphenomorphus traanorum, Sphenomorphus wrighti, and Sphenomorphus victoria only occur on one island. Sphenomorphus acutus, Sphenomorphus arborens, Sphenomorphus bipartalis, Sphenomorphus fasciatus, Sphenomorphus llanosi, Sphenomorphus mindanensis, and Sphenomorphus variegatus are endemic to a single PAIC and can be found on multiple islands within that PAIC. Sphenomorphus abdictus, Sphenomorphus coxi, Sphenomorphus cumingi, Sphenomorphus decipiens, Sphenomorphus jagori, and Sphenomorphus steerei have widespread distributions occurring on more than one PAIC.",

These 31 taxonomic units are organized into six groups in the foundational work of Brown & Alcala (1980); although not created in a phylogenetic framework, these groups have served as convenient phenotypic categories for diagnoses of new species (e.g. Brown, Ferner & Greer, 1995; Ferner et al., 1997; 2010, 1999; Linkem, Diesmos & Brown, 2010a) and as the basis for hypotheses of evolutionary relationships (Linkem et al., 2010b). Each group is diagnosed by a combination of morphological features. Some Philippine groups are similar to Sphenomorphus species groups that occur outside of the Philippines (Greer & Parker, 1967). The species in each of the Brown & Alcala (1980) groups are summarized below.",

The authors also included Sphenomorphus luzonensis and Sphenomorphus palawanensis in Group 2. The discovery of Parvoscincus sisoni led to the transfer of Sphenomorphus palawanensis to the genus Parvoscincus (Ferner et al., 1997). As the two species of Parvoscincus resemble Group 2 species morphologically, we conditionally consider them as members of this group for the purpose of this review of phenotypic variation. The most recent species added to Group 2 was Sphenomorphus tagapayo (Brown et al., 1999); giving a total of eight species in Group 2. Most species in this group have limited distributions, with Sphenomorphus lawtoni, Sphenomorphus luzonensis, and Sphenomorphus tagapayo occurring only in limited regions of Luzon Island; Sphenomorphus atrigularis in western Mindanao; Sphenomorphus biparietalis in the Sulu Archipelago; Parvoscincus palawanensis on Palawan Island; and Parvoscincus sisoni on Panay Island.

Group 3 was considered most similar to Bornean Sphenomorphus murudensis and Sphenomorphus kinabaluensis, which are part of the Greer & Parker (1967) Sphenomorphus variegatus group. Brown & Alcala (1980) partitioned Philippine species of Greer & Parker's (1967) Sphenomorphus variegatus group into Groups 3 and 4 (see below) based on the ratio of midbody scale rows to lamellae beneath toe IV, which were on average fewer in Group 3 species than Group 4 species. Brown & Alcala (1980) placed the following species in Group 3: Sphenomorphus leucospilos, Sphenomorphus mindanensis, Sphenomorphus victoria, Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus, and Sphenomorphus acutus. Sphenomorphus acutus does not fit into any of Brown & Alcala's (1980) groups, but resembles Groups 3 and 4, and was placed in Group 3 by Brown & Alcala (1980). The Group 3 species occur in disparate parts of the archipelago, with Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus and Sphenomorphus leucospilos occurring on Luzon Island, Sphenomorphus victoria on Palawan Island, and Sphenomorphus mindanensis and Sphenomorphus acutus broadly distributed on Mindanao, Samar, and Leyte. Since Brown & Alcala's (1980) review, Brown (1995) described another Group 3 species, Sphenomorphus kitangladensis, from eastern Mindanao (Brown, 1995).",

First, we assess whether there is statistically significant phylogenetic support for the morphological species classifications of Brown & Alcala (1980). We then determine whether these supraspecific assemblages are natural monophyletic groups or whether these apparently cohesive phenotypic clusters of taxa represent instances of morphological convergence. In the context of these broad goals, we address three specific questions. (1) Are the morphologically cohesive, phenotypically defined species groups of Brown & Alcala (1980) natural, monophyletic units or has convergent evolution obscured and confounded our understanding of evolutionary trends in Philippine Sphenomorphus? (2) Are Philippine Sphenomorphus species derived from a single common ancestor, or is this diversity the product of multiple invasions from Asian and/or Papuan sources? (3) Is our current understanding of Sphenomorphus species diversity accurate (28 species), or is species diversity as grossly underestimated as suggested by recent studies (Brown et al., 2010; Linkem et al., 2010b)?",

We did not include all of the previously published data for this Australian clade because previous studies have found it to have high support, although these analyses lacked adequate outgroup sampling.

Similarly, Parvoscincus palawanensis has not been observed by researchers since its original collection and no genetic samples are available. For two widespread species (Sphenomorphus decipiens and Sphenomorphus steerei), we incorporated samples from multiple populations to maximize geographical coverage across known biogeographical boundaries such as mountain ranges and marine channels (Brown & Diesmos, 2001 (2002), 2002), 2009).

As we sought to determine whether Brown & Alcala's classification reflects natural phenotypic variation in the characters that vary amongst Philippine Sphenomorphus, we measured and counted the same characters on adults for all species of Philippine Sphenomorphus (see Brown et al., 2010 for a list of specimens examined). Scale counts, except mid\u2010body scale rows, were taken on the right side of the body and the average value of each species was used for subsequent multivariate analyses (Table 2). Morphological data were analysed in the R statistical package and in JMP8 (SAS Institute Inc.). We used the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA: Sokal & Michner, 1958) to create a phenogram of the morphological characters. Principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted using a correlation matrix on the raw scale counts for midbody scale rows and subdigital lamellae and log\u2010transformed paravertebral scale rows and snout\u2013vent length.

In addition to two mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S) used in Brandley et al. (2005), we sequenced ND2 and ND4, which have been informative in Sphenomorphus group skinks (Reeder, 2003; 2010a, 2010b). We assumed that these mitochondrial genes share a single evolutionary history as a result of matrilineal inheritance and the lack of recombination of the mitochondrion. Brandley et al. (2005) found that the best partitioning strategy for mitochondrial genes was to partition by gene, codon, and ribosomal secondary structure. We therefore concatenated our mitochondrial genes following the partitioning strategy of Brandley et al. (2005) for an 11 partition mitochondrial data set. The nuclear genes we sampled have not been used in skink phylogenetics, so we tested whether they should be partitioned by codon or analysed as a continuous gene. We analysed each gene in MrModelTest v2.2 (Nylander, 2004) to estimate the best\u2010fit nucleotide substitution model, using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the appropriate model. When multiple models had similar scores, we chose the most parameter\u2010rich model within ten AIC units of the best AIC model (Table 4). We assumed that partitions within genes (codons and ribosomal secondary structure) have the same overall model as the entire gene because simulations have shown that choosing the correct model may be difficult with a few hundred characters (Posada & Crandall, 2001).",

Each data set was run with four independent analyses for 20 million generations sampling every 1000 generations. Partitioned Bayesian analyses were completed with rates across partitions unlinked and the prior on branch lengths adjusted to exponential base 100 (Marshall, Simon & Buckley, 2006; Marshall, 2010).

Our results suggest that these morphological novelties represent multiple evolutionary transitions from a generalized plesiomorphic ancestor, repeated independently throughout the range and evolutionary history of the Sphenomorphus group. One such example involves the transition from a scaly lower eyelid to a transparent \u2018window\u2019 in the lower eyelid. Within our sampling the transparent \u2018window\u2019 is found in Lipinia, Scincella, and Papuascincus (clades C and D). It is also found in Sphenomorphus assatus and northern populations of Sphenomorphus cherriei; however southern populations of Sp. cheerei have a scaly eyelid. Clade E is nested within this group of transparent \u2018window\u2019 taxa, but the taxa in clade E have the plesiomorphic state of a scaly eyelid. As Sphenomorphus cherriei and clade E both have the plesiomorphic state, there are two equally parsimonious reconstructions of this character within these taxa, one requiring two reversals to the plesiomorphic state and one requiring a convergence of the derived character with one reversal. These convergences and reversals of complex characters have contributed to the complexity of taxonomic and historical evaluations of the Sphenomorphus group.",

The finding that these separate invasions primarily have been restricted to clades occupying the south\u2010western portion of the archipelago is expected given the geographically proximate potential sources of dispersal (Inger, 1954; Brown & Alcala, 1970). Invasions seem to have originated from different directions, including two potential invasions from Borneo into Mindanao (Sphenomorphus atrigularis, and Sphenomorphus variegatus), one potential invasion from an unknown source into Palawan and Panay (Sphenomorphus arborens, Sphenomorphus traanorum, Sphenomorphus victoria, Sphenomorphus wrighti), and one potential invasion from the New Guinea faunal region into Mindanao (Sphenomorphus fasciatus). Sphenomorphus variegatus was conspecific with Sphenomorphus multisquamatus, Sphenomorphus sabanus, and Sphenomorphus simus (Inger, 1958), the first two species, sampled in this study, are from Borneo, the latter is not sampled and is from Papua New Guinea.

This finding is biogeographically unexpected and may be a result of our missing\u2010taxon sampling from Papua New Guinea and/or Indonesia, or of our phylogenetic misplacement because of our limited gene sampling of the Australian taxa. Outside of the Philippine taxa, clades tend to be geographically restricted, with the caveat that our sampling is taxonomically sparse in these regions (Fig. 3).

Clade I shows some biogeographical patterns similar to those seen in other Philippine animals (Heaney, 1985; Kennedy et al., 2000; Brown & Diesmos, 2001 (2002), 2002), 2009), with speciation events occurring across PAIC boundaries, although there are many speciation events within PAICs. The biogeography of Clade H is discussed in detail by Linkem et al. (2010b). Generally, widespread species in Clade H do not conform to PAIC predictions and there are multiple instances of divergent clades within a species occurring sympatrically. On Luzon Island, there are multiple instances of speciation on the island within Clade K \u2013 cases of potential allopatry across mountain ranges. The most obvious example of this is the clade of Sphenomorphus beyeri, Sphenomorphus boyingi, Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 4, Sphenomorphus hadros, Sphenomorphus igorotorum, and Sphenomorphus laterimaculatus. All of these species are high\u2010elevation endemics found on different mountain ranges on Luzon (Brown et al., 2010). The Sphenomorphus decipiens complex may be another example, but the putative new species have not yet been described.",

Nevertheless, the degree of paraphyly is surprising given that every genus of the Sphenomorphus group sampled is nested within Sphenomorphus sensu lato. One explanation for this problem is that Sphenomorphus was never properly defined with diagnostic characters (Myers & Donnelly, 1991; Greer & Shea, 2003). Thus, species were placed in the genus if they possessed generalized plesiomorphic character states or if their phylogenetic affinities were unclear (Grismer, Ahmad & Onn, 2009).",

As we lack samples of Sphenomorphus buettikoferi, Sphenomorphus malayanus, and Sphenomorphus butleri, we cannot comment on the relationships of those species, but the others are closely related, except Sphenomorphus luzonensis. Recently, numerous small, diminutive species have been described from Malaysia (Grismer, 2006, 2007a, 2007b; Grismer, Ahmad & Onn, 2009; Grismer, Wood & Grismer, 2009). In the recent description of Sphenomorphus temengorensis, Grismer, Ahmad & Onn (2009) summarized the eight species of diminutive skinks in Peninsular Malaysia, all of which are morphologically and ecologically similar to the species in Clade A. We also expect that diminutive species in Indonesia: Sphenomorphus temmincki, Sphenomorphus schlegeli, Sphenomorphus sanana, Sphenomorphus textus, Sphenomorphus necopinatus, and Sphenomorphus vanheurni to be part of this clade based on morphological similarity.

Greer & Parker (1967) divided Papuan Sphenomorphus into the Sphenomorphus variegatus and the Sphenomorphus fasciatus groups. Part of the Sphenomorphus fasciatus group was later put in the Sphenomorphus maindroni group based on a synapomorphic scale character (Greer & Shea, 2003). We have shown that the Sphenomorphus variegatus group is nonmonophyletic, and the one species (Sphenomorphus concinnatus) from the Papuan region that we sampled appears in Clade F. However, other species in the Sphenomorphus variegatus group fall into different clades. Members of the Sphenomorphus maindroni group (Sphenomorphus cranei, Sphenomorphus fasciatus, Sphenomorphus solomonis, and Sphenomorphus scutatus) form a clade based on the four species sampled (of the 22 species in the group).

In some cases, these divergent clades occur in sympatry (Sphenomorphus cf. steerei sp. 5 & 6 on Panay; Sphenomorphus cf. steerei sp. 4 & 5 on Negros; Sphenomorphus cf. steerei sp. 1 & 7 on Mt.

As Sphenomorphus steerei is a diminutive skink it is difficult to find externally diagnosable characters for these separate lineages. Populations of Sphenomorphus decipiens also show significant levels of genetic divergence; unlike Sphenomorphus steerei, there are pronounced morphological differences amongst clades. The most divergent population (Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 4) occurs at high elevations on Mt. Banahao and Mt. Palali on Luzon Island.

Scale counts and the size of Sphenomorphus cf. decipiens sp. 4 diagnose it as Sphenomorphus decipiens; however, these resemblances clearly are convergences because these populations of skinks are genetically so distinct from other Sphenomorphus decipiens.

Clade K is clearly a unique and supported group of mostly small species of Philippine Sphenomorphus.

When Greer (1974: 33) revised the genus Leiolepisma, he provided detailed comments about the potential relationships of these Central American skinks. Morphologically, these species are a mix of Sphenomorphus and Scincella, with Scincella assatus and Scincella incertus lacking a postorbital bone but possessing a window in the lower eye (characters of Scincella) and Scincella cherriei possessing a postorbital bone but having population variation in the presence of the lower eyelid window. Greer (1974) inferred that Scincella cherriei was the primitive form of the Central American radiation owing to the possession of the postorbital bone and placed these species in Sphenomorphus. He noted that this did not make sense biogeographically because it inferred a separate migration across the Bering Bridge, but he argued it was more plausible than the re\u2010evolution of the postorbital bone in Scincella cherriei. Our molecular evidence shows that the Central American species are part of the same radiation as North American Scincella, following the biogeographical expectation. It is therefore reasonable to move these Central American skinks to the genus Scincella.",

We have shown that the largest genus of skinks in Scincidae is highly paraphyletic. Based on our phylogeny, morphological convergence in scale characters and body size are common within Philippine Sphenomorphus; these phenomena clearly have confounded past supraspecific taxonomic treatments. Taxonomic revisions based on robust molecular phylogenies may avoid misdiagnosing phylogenetic relationships resulting from high levels of homoplasy in some morphological characters. However, it is clear that many of these same morphological characters are useful for identifying new species. We have shown that species composition varies on different islands, with Luzon and Palawan being composed of closely related species, and the Mindanao faunal region being composed of an assembled fauna, derived from multiple separate invasions of the archipelago. Widespread species in the Philippines continue to show divergent relationships both within and between islands, and divergent clades often occur in sympatry. It is likely that morphological examination of subclades of these widespread species may reveal greater species diversity than currently recognized. If so, a more comprehensive understanding of Philippine Sphenomorphus group skinks will require a deeper knowledge of the diversity of the skinks in this unique archipelago.",

Morphological UPGMA clustering was calculated in JMP using average distances. The PCA plot is for PC1 and PC2 in Table 7. Species groups from Brown & Alcala (1980) are colour\u2010coded. Morphological UPGMA clustering shows species groups are morphologically congruent, but the phylogeny demonstrates that the same morphological types are convergent.",
