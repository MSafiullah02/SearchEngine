Longing for the COVID-19 surge, the hospital teams reorganized to increase efficiency and avoid burnout. I meet with the third-year resident and the intern; a future dermatologist, who I have known since she was a student. My team has only volunteers; they want to see patients with COVID-19. At this moment of the pandemic, we have learned that asymptomatic transmission occurs and that with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) no one in our hospital caught the virus [2, 3] . This combination makes us feel safe, as every one of our suspected COVID-19 patients is seen in full PPE, and our risk is thus low. The few patients we see only wearing our masks have already been ",
