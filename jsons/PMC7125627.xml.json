            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease first described in early 2003.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 It is transmitted by a coronavirus and presents as an atypical pneumonia. The morbidity and mortality associated with SARS is high. From early March 2003 to late May 2003, SARS was detected in Singapore. Two hundred and thirty-eight patients were infected of which 33 died. Ninety-seven (42%) of those infected were health care workers. Five of them died. The whole medical system in the country was put under stress. One major hospital became the designated SARS hospital and stopped receiving other cases. Emergency cases were then diverted to the other remaining public hospitals; the Singapore General Hospital was the main recipient of diverted cases. The increase in workload of critically ill cases, new infection control procedures including mandatory wearing of the powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and personal protective equipment (PPE), and limiting the number of person-contacts with each patient were thought to affect resuscitation and airway management. Our aim was to study the effects of the wearing of PAPR, PPE and the restriction in the number of resuscitation personnel on airway management during the SARS crisis.",

In the pre-SARS period and in the 1999\u20132002 study, medical officers attempted 45.1% and 40.5% of intubations, respectively. During SARS and immediately post-SARS there was a significant decline in the proportion of intubations performed by them (35.2% and 17.7%, respectively) (Table 4). This could be due to the fact that there was a restriction in the number of healthcare workers in contact with each patient in an attempt to minimise the risk of spreading SARS. As a result, the most experienced or confident personnel performed the intubation and this was usually the attending emergency physician. The higher first attempt success rate during SARS compared to the other periods could have been a combination of factors including competent emergency physicians performing more intubations and an increase in the number of patients with cardiac arrest during SARS who generally are easy to intubate. What is difficult to comprehend is the observation that the medical officer intubation rate dropped even further after the SARS crisis. Was it because attending emergency physicians found it more convenient to perform the intubations themselves rather than to supervise the medical officers? Or did the medical officers shun from managing ill patients for fear of contracting SARS? This trend will possibly affect the training of medical officers in emergency airway management and should be monitored closely. Intervention may be necessary if the trend persists.",
