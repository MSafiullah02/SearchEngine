The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed by One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the primer set which amplifies the S1 gene of IBV [17] . After 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, the amplification products were purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The commercialized outsourcing sequence service (Fasmac DNA sequence service, http://fasmac.co.jp/gene_loupe) was utilized for the sequence of amplification products. Based on the sequences of amplification products and several S1 gene sequences of IBV retrieved from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (500 bootstrap replicates) using MEGA 6 Software (https://www.megasoftware.net). The S1 genotypes of each sample were defined according to the classification that Mase et al. identified [17] [18] [19] .

Also, the major clinical sign caused by IBV isolates submitted from the various regions in Japan for phylogenetic analysis was mostly nephritis since 1989, whereas that was respiratory from 1951 to 1980 [17] . Hence, it appeared that the pathotype of IBV field strain chronologically changed from respiratory to nephropathogenic in Japan. In Kagoshima prefecture, there was no report regarding the pathotype of IBV field strain except for the report in 1981 [20] and the predominant pathotype of IBV has not been known for a long period. The result of the present study showed that the detection of IBV field strain with nephropathogenicity has significantly increased in Kagoshima prefecture since 2014, suggesting that the nephropathogenic strain of IBV became predominant in Kagoshima prefecture. Conversely, the change of pathogenicity from highly nephropathogenic to respiratory has been reported in the field strain in Australia [8] , and thus it appeared that IBV field strains have constantly altered the pathogenic features.",

            "text": "The JP-I is indigenous to Japan [17] , and it was speculated that the JP-I has originally evolved for a long time also in Kagoshima prefecture. On the other hand, the origin of JP-III is unclear. The phylogenetic analysis of present and previous studies suggests that the JP-III is closely related to the isolate in China [1, 17] . It has been believed that the IBV has a wide host range and infects not only poultry but also wild birds such as a duck [6, 15] . Mase et al. inferred the possibility of involvement of wild birds regarding the dissemination of IBV into Japan [17] . In Kagoshima prefecture, there is a large plain (called \"Izumi plain\") as an overwintering site for wild migrant birds including a duck that infects with a virus such as avian influenza virus and that migrates among neighboring countries including China [21] . The predominance of JP-III in Kagoshima prefecture might not be irrelevant to the existence of a \"portal site\", such as Izumi plain, for viruses derived from neighboring countries. It is essential for the prevention and control of IB to estimate the S1 genotype of IBV field strain because the S1 genotype of field strain is associated with the vaccine selection in a chicken farm. All of the S1 genotypes, except for JP-II, were detected in Kagoshima prefecture since 2008. It implied the diversity of IBV field strain in Kagoshima prefecture. A flexible vaccination strategy would be needed for the prevention and control of IB.",

The 3 samples were collected from 3 different cases (Case 2, 8 and 11 in Table 1 ) and the earliest detection case was in January 2009 in a broiler farm (Case 2 in Table 1 ). On the other hand, the JP-IV was initially reported as a novel genotype of IBV in Japan, which was identified from the samples collected in September 2009 in a layer farm located at Ibaraki prefecture [19] , more than 1,000 km far away from Kagoshima prefecture. Although the JP-IV was found in the farms located at Ibaraki and Kagoshima prefecture almost during the corresponding period, there was no geographic and epidemiological relationship between the two farms. Hence, it appeared that JP-IV has widely disseminated into Japan since at least 2009. In addition, the virulence of JP-IV was believed to be low in the previous study [19] . However, the both of respiratory and renal lesions were histopathologically confirmed in 2 of 3 cases (Case 8 and 11, Table 1 ) that the JP-IV was detected, and the JP-IV alone was detected in Case 11 ( Table 1 ). The 2 cases suggest the altered pathogenicity of JP-IV strain in Japan although the virulence to affected chickens in the cases might not necessarily be due to the IBV alone because of the complications such as Coccidiosis and Colibacillosis. Moreover, the antigenicity of JP-IV differs from others detected in Japan [19] . Therefore, the JP-IV strain could be a great threat to all of the chicken farms in Japan. Further studies regarding the pathogenicity and the prevalent status of JP-IV strain in Japan would be needed for the prevention of IB caused by JP-IV strain. ",
