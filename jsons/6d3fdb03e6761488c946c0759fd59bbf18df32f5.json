Chromanones are also distinctive compounds of this genus. A number of plants of this genus are used as traditional herbal medicines, such as being a diuretic [4] , for the treatment of malaria, venereal diseases, and for blood pressure [5] , rheumatism, varicose, haemorrhoids, and chronic ulcers [6] , as well as skin infections, wounds, leprous nephritis, pain, eye diseases, and inflammations [7] . The modern pharmacology research of genus Calophyllum has further revealed many activities, such as antiviral, antitumor-promoting, antimalarial, antibacterial, as well as cytotoxic activity.",

Natural coumarins isolated from the Calophyllum genus belong, from a biogenetic point of view, to a homogeneous group of naturally occurring heterocycles with a biosynthetic scheme related to that of neoflavonoids [76] . The known coumarins of the genus Calophyllum isolated over the past few decades include pyranocoumarins, 1 -47, furocoumarins, 48 -65, furo-pyranocoumarins, 66 -69, simple coumarins, 70 -80, and others, 81 -84. Individual members of the groups vary with respect to the substituent at C(4) of the lactone ring of the coumarins, where Me, Pr, or Ph groups may be encountered. In 1996, McKee et al. concluded three basic structural types of pyranocoumarins which are the most frequent coumarins (Fig. 1) : i) tetracyclic dipyranocoumarins A, in which the C rings have a geminal dimethyl moiety, e.g., compounds 1 -18; ii) tricyclic pyranocoumarins B, e.g., compounds 19 -32; and iii) tetracyclic dipyranocoumarins C with reversed C and D pyran rings, i.e., the geminal dimethyl groups are in the D ring, e.g., as in compounds 33 -35 [19] .",

McKee et al. isolated this compound and its diastereoisomer calanolide E2 (27) from the stem bark of the same plant. So, they renamed calanolide E as calanolide E 1 , but the configurations of the two diastereoisomers were not defined [19] . Recedesolide (31) was isolated from C. recedens and C. blancoi with different structures [26] [27] . Compounds 34 and 35 were first identified as shown in Fig. 2 , with the names as calanolides C and D, respectively [3] , but later, their structures were revised, and they were renamed as pseudocalanolides C and D (Table) [77] [78] .

            "text": "2.2. Xanthones. The genus Calophyllum is considered as a rich source of xanthone derivatives which are simply oxygenated and substituted with isoprenyl group(s) [79] . The xanthones with differences from C(1) to C(8), i.e., 85 -13 are listed in the Table. Besides OH, MeO, isoprenyl, and COOMe groups, the substituents also include some special groups such as 3-carboxybutyl (i.e., 119 and 120), 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl (i.e., 121), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl (i.e., 123), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl (i.e., 124), and 1,1-dimethylprop-2-enyloxy (i.e., 133). The compound 122 is 1,5-dihydroxy-6-(3,3-dimethylbut-2-enyl)-1,5-dihydroxyxanthone, named as calophyllin B by Jackson et al. [46] , while Iinuma et al. and Gottlieb et al. named it as guanandin [31] [42] . Apetalinone A (133) was a novel xanthone with 1,1-dimethylprop-2-enyloxy ether moiety, which indicated a new biosynthetic pathway including Claisen rearrangement and Diels -Alder reaction. The occurrence of a xanthone with a 1,1-dimethylallyl group was reported for the first time in 1997 [40] . Compounds 134 -147 were pyranoxanthones that possess a pyran ring at C(5)\u00c0C(6), C(6)\u00c0C (7), or C(7)\u00c0C (8) . Two of them were named differently by different authors, compound 138 was named as caloxanthone C, inoxanthone, or blancoxanthone [10] [49] [53] ; compound 139 was named as macluraxanthone and 3-hydroxyblancoxanthone [10] [36] [49] [53] . Jacareubin (135) and 6-dehydroxyjacareubin (136) are very common constituents in genus Calophyllum. They have been found in C. cordato-oblongum, C. tomentosum, C. neoebudicum, C. brasiliense, C. inophyllum, C. ramiflorum, and C. austroindicum [31 -34] [37] [41] [42] [44 -46] . C. moonii afforded a trioxygenated diprenylated chromenxanthone, dombakinaxanthone (144) [55] . The pyranoxanthones 148 -151 possess two pyran rings at C(2)\u00c0C(3) and C(6)\u00c0C (7) Papuanic and isopapuanic acids (186 and 187, resp.) represented the first pair of stereoisomeric products isolated from a species of Calophyllum [63] . Compounds 189 -191 were isolated from C. verticillatum [64] . They have a rarely occurring cyclobutane moiety derived from the equally unusual lavandulyl chain. Compounds 190 and 191 are definitely distinct substances, since they can be easily separated on TLC plates. Small, but significant differences were also observed in the 1 H-NMR spectra, particularly in the chemical shifts of the signals for the two side chains. It was proposed that the absolute configuration at C(6) may differ in compounds 190 and 191, although changes in the absolute configuration at C (22) and C(23) cannot be totally ruled out.",

Calanolides A and B (7 and 10, resp.) were completely protective against HIV-1 replication and cytopathicity (EC 50 values of 0.1 and 0.4 mm, resp.). 12-Acetoxycalanolide A (8) was also active, albeit less potent (EC 50 2.7 mm). The apparent in vitro therapeutic indices (TI) for compounds 7, 8, and 10 were 200, 5, and 37, respectively. Studies with purified bacterial recombinant RT revealed that the calanolides are HIV-1-specific RT inhibitors distinct from any previously known pharmacologic class. Moreover, calanolide A (7) was active not only against AZT-resistant viral strains, as well as against the A 17 strain, which is known to be resistant to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors. Therefore, the pyranocoumarins provide a new class of anti-HIV compounds [3] . In 1993, Kashman et al. tested compounds 1, 2, 14, 16 -19, 36, 37, 66 , and 67 for their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 RT. Inophyllums B and P (16 and 17, resp.) inhibited HIV RT with IC 50 values of 38 and 130 mm, respectively, and both were active against HIV-1 in cell culture (IC 50 1.4 and 1.6 mm, resp.). The configuration at C(12) is not critical, because 16 and 17 are both active at submicromolar concentrations, but the presence of a C\u00bcO group at this position lowered the activity significantly. The other compounds were much less active or inactive [2] . Soulattrolide (15) , the enantiomer of inophyllum P (17), which was isolated from C. teysmannii latex, also found to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 RT with an IC 50 value of 0.34 mm [21] . In 2003, Yu et al. reviewed the recent progress in the development of coumarin derivatives as potent anti-HIV agents [81] . For the coumarins isolated from genus Calophyllum, they determined the structure -activity relationship as well as the mechanism of action. First, bulky substituents are required at C(4); second, both calanolides and inophyllums require Me groups at C(10) and C(11) of the chromanol ring to be trans-diaxial; third, both calanolides and inophyllums require a H-bond acceptor at C (12) . In case of calanolides, the configuration at C (12) should be (S), or C\u00bcO group can be present. The configuration at C(12) of inophyllums can be either (S) or (R), but a C\u00bcO group is not allowed.",

In 2001, Ito et al. investigated the antitumorpromoting activity of ten natural 4-phenylcoumarins using the short-term in vitro assay of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced Epstein -Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation in Raji cells [82] . The compounds are tetracyclic (i.e., 1, 2, 14, and 18), tricyclic (i.e., 19, 39, and 44) , and dimethylcyclopropan fused (i.e., 48 and 68) 4-phenylcoumarins, and isocalophyllic acid (37) , which were isolated from C. inophyllum. All tested compounds except for inophyllum C (1) and calocoumarin C (68) showed an inhibitory effect on EBV-EA activation, even at 1 \u00c2 10 mol ratio, and only weak cytotoxicity against Raji cells, even at 1 \u00c2 10 3 mol ratio. Calocoumarin A (44) showed more potent activity than any of the other compounds, suggesting that the prenyl side chain is decisive in increasing the antitumor-promoting effect [83] . Furthermore, calocoumarin A (44) exhibited a marked inhibitory effect on mouse skin tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage carcinogenesis test. The results of the investigation by Ito et al. indicated that some of these 4-phenylcoumarins might be valuable as potential cancer chemopreventive agents (antitumor promoters) [82] . In 2005, Ito et al. also tested three 4-phenylcoumarins (i.e., 21, 43, and 55), and five 4propylcoumarins (i.e., 7, 20, 23, 34, and 73), which were isolated from the stem bark of C. brasiliense [11] . All tested compounds showed inhibitory activity against EBV-EA without showing any cytotoxicity. The IC 50 values of all tested compounds were lower than that of b-carotene. Among 4-propylcoumarins, 7, 23, and 73 showed more significant activities compared with 4-phenylcoumarins, 21, 43, and 55. Mammea B/BB (73), 4-propylcoumarin with a prenyl side chain, exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity. Calanolide A (7) with trans-oriented 10,11-dimethyl groups was more potent than the corresponding cis-derivative, i.e., calanolide C (34). These results are in accordance with the pattern of anti-HIV activity that the functional groups at C(10), C(11), and C (12) , and their derivatives are critical for their anti-HIV activity [11] .",

The highest activity was exhibited by mammea A/BA (70; IC 50 0.04 to 0.59 mm). The mixtures of mammea A/BA \u00fe A/BB (70 and 71), mammea B/BA \u00fe B/BB (72 and 73) , and mammea C/OA \u00feC/OB (74 and 75) were also highly active (IC 50 < 4.05 mm). In contrast, mammea B/BA cyclo F (52) pure or in mixture with mammea B/BB cyclo F (53) were less potent with IC 50 values of 5.0 -63 mm. The above data suggest that a Pr, pentyl, or Ph group at C(4) (i.e., 70 -75) is relevant for high cytoxic activity. On the other hand, a 6-prenyl chain (i.e., 70 -75) increases cytotoxicity, but this effect decreases if this substituent is cyclized to a dihydrofuran or a pyran ring (i.e., 52 and 53) [24] . GUT-70, characterized as a tricyclic coumarin, 5-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-6-(2-methyl-1-oxobut-2-enyl)-10-propyl-2H,8Hbenzo[1,2-b;3,4-b']dipyran-8-one (23) , was tested on six human leukemic cell lines, BV173, K562, NALM6, HL60, SEM, and the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HCT116, including a P-glycoprotein over-expressing cell line. It significantly inhibited the growth of leukemic cells by inducing caspase-mediated and p53-independent apoptosis, and can overcome multidrug resistance [84] . The cytotoxic effect against KB cell of a number of known compounds isolated from genus Calophyllum was evaluated. Calophyllolide 19 displayed the most significant cytotoxic activity against KB cells with an IC 50 value of 3.5 mg/ml. Other compounds such as caloxanthone A (139), with an IC 50 value of 7.4 mg/ml, was considered, in addition to calaustralin (40) and inophyllum E (2), as inactive [10] . The furanocoumarins mammea A/BA cyclo F (49), mammea A/ AA cyclo F (63), mammea A/AB cyclo F (64), mammea A/AC cyclo F (65), together with other coumarins, isodispar B (76), disparpropylinol B (78), and disparinol B (79) , which were all isolated from C. dispar, also exhibited significant activities in this assay, since these compounds inhibited 50% of the cellular growth at concentration ranging from 5 to 9 and 4 to 8 mg/ml, respectively [29] [30] .",

All extracts showed a range of activity against all the tested bacteria and protozoan. Fractionation improved the level of activity, particularly the petroleum ether fraction of the root bark [5] . Besides the extracts, the antibacterial activity of several constituents were also evaluated. Six chromanone acids, i.e., 192 -197, isolated from C. brasiliense showed moderate-to-strong antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Compounds 194 and 195 were most active against B. cereus, while compounds 196 and 197 are less active. Thus, the presence of a cyclobutane ring in compounds 192 -195 most probably contributes to the strong antibacterial activity [65] . Mammea A/BA \u00fe A/BB (70 \u00fe 71), and mammea C/OA \u00feC/ OB (74 \u00fe 75) inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and B. subtilis [24] . The inhibition of S. aureus was also observed with calozeyloxanthone. The MIC values of calozeyloxanthone (162) for S. aureus ranged from 4.1 to 8.1 mg/ml. Hence, 162 appears to hold promise as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of infections with S. aureus [85] . In 2004, Yimdjo et al. also evaluated the isolated compounds for their antimicrobial and potency against representative Gram-positive (S. aureus, Vibrio anguillarium) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria, and yeast, and Candida tropicalis organisms, in agar well diffusion assays. At the dose of 20 mg/disc, caloxanthone A (137), calophyllolide (19) , and inophyllum C (1) and E (2) were found to exhibit significant inhibitory activity against S. aureus, but not against other microorganisms [21] .",

Sartori et al. investigated the pharmacological basis for the ethnomedicinal use of stem bark extracts of C. brasiliense in gastrointestinal affections. This study examined the effects of a CH 2 Cl 2 fraction, obtained from the hexane extract of bark, on EtOH, indomethacin, and hypothermic restraint stress-induced gastric lesions in mice and rats, respectively. Oral administration of CH 2 Cl 2 fraction at doses ranging from 12.5 to 250 mg/kg significantly inhibited the development of gastric lesions in all three test models. It caused significant decreases of the pyloric-ligation and bethanechol-stimulated gastric secretion, and also the free and total acidities. Besides, CH 2 Cl 2 fraction offered protection against EtOHinduced depletion of stomach-wall mucus and reduction in nonprotein sulfhydryl concentration. The results indicate that CH 2 Cl 2 fraction from C. brasiliense possesses antisecretory, antiulcer, and cytoprotective properties [6] .",

Four xanthones, 127, 128, 135, and 136, and two coumarins, 70 and 74, which were obtained from C. brasiliense, were tested as substrates and inhibitors for two recombinant sulfotransferases (SULTs). Assays were performed using recombinant phenolsulfotransferase (SULT1A1) and hydroxysteroidsulfotransferase (SULT2A1). Two xanthones, 135 and 136, and two coumarins, 70 and 74, tested were substrates for SULT1A1, while the coumarin mammea A/BA (70) was a substrate for SULT2A1. The xanthones 127, 128, 135, and 136 reversibly inhibited SULT1A1 with IC 50 values ranging from 1.6 to 7.4 mm. Both coumarins 70 and 74 inhibited SULT1A1 with IC 50 values of 47 and 185 mm, and SULT2A1 with IC 50 values of 16 and 31 mm. The results indicate that SULT1A1, but not SULT2A1, is highly sensitive to inhibition by xanthones. The potency of this inhibition depends on the position and number of OH groups. Conversely, SULT2A1 is 3 -6 times more sensitive to coumarins than SULT1A1 [86] .",

Biflavonoids and neoflavonoids are also distinctive constituents in this genus. The studies on chemical constituents in recent years have disclosed many different activities of the isolated compounds, such as antiviral activity, antitumor-promoting activity, inhibition of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein, cytotoxic activity, antimalarial activity, antibacterial activity, activity in gastrointestinal affections, and inhibition of sulfotransferases, especially anti-HIV activity of calanolides and inophyllums. The possible biosynthetic pathways of several compounds are also reviewed in this article. Nevertheless, there are still many plants of this genus that have not yet received enough attention. This review might provide some motivation for further investigations on genus Calophyllum.",
