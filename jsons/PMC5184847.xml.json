Upon antigenic encountering in the secondary lymphoid organs, na\u00efve CD8+ T cells undergo stepwise stages of responses including activation, expansion, and differentiation into effector CD8+ T cells (i.e., cytotoxic T lymphocytes) 1, 2. Effector CD8+ T cells acquire tissue tropic chemotactic receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR3 while simultaneously downregulate lymphoid tissue homing receptors such as CCR7 1, 2, which allow them to infiltrate peripheral tissues to clear pathogen\u2010infected or transformed cells. In the tissue, effector CD8+ T cells use multiple mechanisms to combat invading enemies. Most prominently, effector CD8+ T cells express key cytolytic molecules including granzymes, perforin, and death receptor ligands and are able to clear virus\u2010infected cells or transformed cells through contact\u2010dependent mechanisms. In addition, effector CD8+ T cells also express multiple antiviral and antitumor proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, to inhibit viral replication and kill tumor cells. Notably, these direct and indirect antiviral and tumor activities of effector CD8+ T cells, if unchecked, also can cause severe inflammation and tissue destruction 1, 3, 4, 5.",

Furthermore, we showed that IL\u20102 cooperates with innate cell\u2010derived IL\u201027 to upregulate IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells specifically in the lung through the transcription factor B\u2010lymphocyte\u2010induced maturation protein\u20101 (Blimp\u20101) dependent mechanisms 6.

Initially discovered as the proinflammatory \u201csignal 3\u201d cytokines, type I IFNs were shown to promote CD8+ T\u2010cell expansion and effector differentiation during bacterial and viral infections 13, 14. Moreover, type I IFN signaling in CD8+ T cells can protect CD8+ T cell from NK\u2010cell\u2010mediated deletion during chronic virus infection 15, 16. Besides their role in enhancing antiviral immune responses, type I IFNs signals also promote IL\u201010 and PD\u2010L1 production/expression and suppress effective CTL responses during chronic LCMV infection 17, 18, suggesting that type I IFN signaling possesses immune\u2010regulatory functions. Similarly, recent evidence has demonstrated that type I IFNs are required for IL\u201010 production during influenza infection 19, 20. Arimori et al. showed that IFN\u2010\u03b1 receptor 1 (IFNAR1) deficient mice exhibited diminished IL\u201010 levels in the lung, enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production, and increased host mortality following influenza virus infection 20. However, how type I IFN signaling promotes IL\u201010 production during influenza infection is currently unknown. Furthermore, given that T cells, particularly effector CD8+ T cells, are a major cellular source of IL\u201010 during influenza infection, it is important to determine whether and how type I IFN signaling affects IL\u201010 production of T cells.",

We found that type I IFN signaling is critically important in driving IL\u201010 production by effector CD8+ T cells, but only plays modest role in promoting IL\u201010 production by CD4+ T cells during influenza infection. We found that type I IFN signaling promotes IL\u201027 production by APCs to indirectly facilitate CD8+ T\u2010cell IL\u201010 production in a CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2010nonautonomous fashion. Interestingly, we found that direct type I IFN signaling in CD8+ T cells is also critical for the maximal generation of IL\u201010\u2010producing effector CD8+ T cells during influenza infection. Mechanistically, type I IFN signaling, in cooperation with IL\u201027 and IL\u20102 signaling, promotes and sustains the expression of Blimp\u20101 and IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), two transcription factors required for the production of IL\u201010 by effector CD8+ T cells.

At day 7 post infection (at the time when maximal IL\u201010 was made in vivo) 6, 8, we stimulated lung T cells with influenza\u2010infected WT BM\u2010derived DCs (BMDCs) and measured IL\u201010 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by T cells following stimulation as we previously reported 6, 8. We found that IFNAR1 deficiency modestly affected IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by CD8+ T cells, but dramatically diminished IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1A). We then normalized IL\u201010+ CD8+ T cells to IFN\u2010\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells to determine the relative abundance of IL\u201010\u2010producing cells in IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing antigen\u2010specific CD8 T cells. We found that IFNAR1 deficiency significantly abrogated IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells within the antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell population (Fig. 1B). IFNAR1 deficiency also decreased the per\u2010cell production of IL\u201010 by effector CD8+ T cells as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IL\u201010 in IL\u201010+ cells diminished in the absence of IFNAR1 (Supporting Information Fig. 1A). In addition, IFNAR1 deficiency diminished IL\u201010\u2010producing CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1C), although the relative abundance of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD4+ T cells in antigen\u2010specific IFN\u2010\u03b3+ CD4+ T cells only modestly diminished in the absence of IFNAR1 (Fig. 1D). Consistent with their diminished levels of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, IFNAR1\u2010deficient mice exhibited diminished airway IL\u201010 levels and increased airway IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels in vivo during influenza infection (Figs. 1E and F), consistent with the recent findings that type I IFN signaling is required for IL\u201010 but not IFN\u2010\u03b3 production in vivo during influenza infection 19, 20. Following type I IFNs engagement, IFNAR initiates downstream events to form a signaling complex consisting of STAT1/STAT2/IRF9, which mediate the major functions of type I IFNs 23, 24. We therefore examined whether STAT2 is required for the generation of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells in vivo during influenza infection. We found that STAT2 deficiency significantly diminished IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells in the lung (Fig. 1G and H). STAT2 deficiency also significantly decreased IL\u201010 MFI in IL\u201010+ CD8+ effector T cells (Supporting Information Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data suggested that STAT2\u2010dependent IFNAR1 signaling is required for the generation of IL\u201010\u2010producing effector CD8+ T cells during influenza infection.",

We infected IFNAR1\u2010deficient Vert\u2010X mice with influenza and then examined in vivo IL\u201010 production through the reporter eGFP expression on T cells at day 7 post infection. We found that, compared to those of IFNAR1\u2010sufficient Vert\u2010X mice, CD8+ T cells from IFNAR1\u2010deficient mice exhibited diminished percentages of IL\u201010/eGFP+ cells (Fig. 2A and B) and a lower per\u2010cell level of IL\u201010/eGFP (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the idea that IFNAR1 signaling is required for the potent induction of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells. We also examined IL\u201010/eGFP expression by influenza\u2010specific PA224 tetramer+ CD8+ T cells and found that the deficiency of IFNAR1 resulted in decreased percentages of IL\u201010/eGFP+ cells within PA224+ CD8+ T cell population and diminished IL\u201010/eGFP MFI (Fig. 2D\u2013F). The deficiency of IFNAR1 did not significantly decrease IL\u201010/eGFP expression by CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2G and H).

Type I IFNs have been shown to stimulate IL\u201027 production by APCs 26. We found that APCs (including macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils) are the main sources of IL\u201027 expression (particularly p28 subunit) in the lung at day 5 post influenza infection, at the time when effector T cells begin to migrate to the lungs and upregulate IL\u201010 expression there (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the previous findings, we found that type I IFNs were able to induce the expression of IL\u201027 in DCs, macrophages, and neutrophils (Supporting Information Fig. 2), the main APC types in the infected lungs when CD8+ T cells start to produce IL\u201010 27, 28. Therefore, we reasoned that type I IFNs induce IL\u201027 production, thereby supporting IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells. To address this hypothesis, we examined the expression of IL\u201027 subunits in the draining mediastinal LNs (MLN) and the lungs 6, 8. We found that, compared to those of WT mice, EBV\u2010induced 3 (Ebi3) and p28 expression in the lung of IFNAR1\u2010deficient mice was significantly decreased (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, airway IL\u201027 p28 protein levels were also diminished in IFNAR1\u2010deficient mice following influenza infection (Fig. 3C). Together, these data suggest that type I IFN signaling is required for the optimal production of the IL\u201010 inducing cytokine, IL\u201027, during influenza infection.",

To do so, we lethally irradiated WT mice and then reconstituted the mice with 1:1 mixed CD45 mismatched WT and IFNAR1\u2010deficient BM cells (Fig. 4A). Twelve weeks after reconstitution, we infected the chimeric mice with influenza and found that the T\u2010cell compartments in the lungs of the infected mice were successfully reconstituted with both WT or Ifnar1\u2212/\u2010 cells (Supporting Information Fig. 3A). We then checked IL\u201010 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production following in vitro restimulation of T cells. We found that IL\u201010 production by IFNAR1\u2010deficient CD8+ T cells is significantly lower than that of WT CD8+ T cells even within the same hosts (Fig. 4B and C). Furthermore, the IL\u201010 MFI is also significantly lower in IFNAR1\u2010deficient CD8+ T cells than that of WT CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4D).

We have shown previously that Blimp\u20101 is required for the development of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo during influenza infection 6. We now observed that type I IFNs cooperated with IL\u20102 and IL\u201027 to induce the expression of Blimp\u20101 in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6A and B). To determine whether Blimp\u20101 is required for the induction of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells in vitro, we cultured WT or Blimp\u20101\u2010deficient CD8+ T cells in the absence or presence of IFN\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20102/IL\u201027, or IFN\u2010\u03b1/IL\u20102/IL\u201027.

Furthermore, Blimp\u20101 was also required for the secretion of IL\u201010 by CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6D). Thus, these data suggest that Blimp\u20101 is required for the production of IL\u201010 by CD8+ T cells upon type I IFN signaling, consistent with the our previous findings that Blimp\u20101 is essential for the development of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells in vivo during influenza infection 6.",

IRF4 was also shown to regulate IL\u201010 production by effector CD4+ T cells and Foxp3+ regulatory CD4+ T cells 30, 31. We therefore examined whether type I IFNs signaling promoted IRF4 expression. We found that IFN\u2010\u03b1 was able to cooperate with IL\u20102/IL\u201027 to promote and sustain IRF4 expression in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6E and Supporting Information Fig. 4).

Besides their direct antiviral functions, type I IFNs are well known to regulate the development of innate and adaptive immunity during respiratory virus infections 32, 33. Early type I IFN signaling was important in the production of inflammatory cytokines during influenza infection 34, 35. Furthermore, type I IFN signaling plays a critical role in regulating the development antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes during influenza infection 21. Consistent with their role in promoting inflammation and immunity, overproduction of type I IFNs contributed significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza virus and mouse\u2010adapted coronavirus infection 36, 37, 38. On the other hand, our data here and results from Arimori et al. have also suggested that type I IFNs could have regulatory role by restricting exuberant inflammatory responses through the induction of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL\u201010 20. Indeed, IFNAR1\u2010deficient mice showed an exuberant host inflammatory response and IL\u201010 administration could ameliorate excessive lethal inflammation and associated mortality following influenza infection in IFNAR1\u2010deficient mice 20. Such a regulatory role of type I IFN signaling in inflammation and immunity has been documented during chronic viral infections 17, 18. Thus, type I IFNs could display differing roles in regulating the development of inflammatory responses and immunity following viral infections, and their exact function in regulating inflammation and immunity would be dependent on the infectious organism as well as the timing and levels of the production of these pluripotent antiviral cytokines.",

Conversely, the production of IL\u201010 at the time of effector T\u2010cell infiltration into the lung (i.e., day 5 and thereafter) could suppress the development of lethal pulmonary inflammation during influenza infection 8, 41. Similar beneficial effects of T\u2010cell\u2010derived IL\u201010 have also been reported during RSV and coronavirus infections 7, 9, 10, 11. Currently, the role of type I IFNs in regulating IL\u201010 production by human CD8+ T cells has not been investigated. However, a recent clinical study has established that both type I IFNs and IL\u201010 were elevated in patients with severe influenza virus infection 42. These data suggested that type I IFNs might facilitate IL\u201010 production by effector T cells during human influenza infection. Whether IL\u201010 production is beneficial to the host by keeping inflammation under control or is detrimental to the host by suppressing antiviral immunity in these patients warrants further investigation. However, understanding the timing\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent regulating of pulmonary inflammation and immunity by type I IFNs and IL\u201010 will be insightful for developing novel therapeutic strategies aiming to dampen excessive respiratory inflammation and diseases during severe influenza infection.",

Similarly, we found that type I IFNs could stimulate IL\u201027 expression in major lung APCs during influenza virus infection, including macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils. Furthermore, IL\u201027 levels were significantly diminished in the respiratory tract in the absence of type I IFN signaling. Thus, type I IFNs could promote IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells through its indirect effects on regulating IL\u201027 levels in vivo. Surprisingly, through the mixed BM chimera experiments, we have also established that direct type I IFN signaling is important in IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells during influenza infection. Currently, the relative contribution of the indirect and direct effects of type I IFN signaling in CD8+ T cells in promoting IL\u201010 production remains to be determined. Further experiments such as supplementation of influenza\u2010infected IFNAR\u2010deficient mice with recombinant IL\u201027 would be interesting to evaluate with respect to the induction of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, type I IFN signaling substantially enhances IL\u201010 by CD8+ T cells in vitro in the presence of IL\u20102 and IL\u201027. At present, the mechanism(s) by which type I IFNs cooperate with IL\u20102 and IL\u201027 to promote IL\u201010 production is unknown. Type I IFN signaling has been shown to sustain the expression of high affinity IL\u20102 receptor on CD8+ T\u2010cell surface 43. So, it is possible that type I IFN signaling promotes IL\u201010 production by facilitating IL\u20102 and/or IL\u201027 signaling in CD8+ T cells. Conversely, it is possible that IL\u20102 and IL\u201027 treatment could boost IFNAR1 expression and/or its downstream signaling to promote IL\u201010 expression.",

In a previous report, we identified IRF4 expression as essential for the induction of Blimp\u20101 and its downstream antiviral effector cytokine molecules in CD8+ T cells 29. By normalizing IL\u201010\u2010producing cells to IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells, we showed that IRF4 is also critically important for IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells. We speculate that IRF4 functions upstream of Blimp\u20101 to promote IL\u201010 expression in CD8+ T cells. However, it is also possible that IRF4 could directly bind to the IL\u201010 locus to promote IL\u201010 production in CD8+ T cells since it was shown that the IL\u201010 locus contains IRF4\u2010binding motifs 30. The strength of TCR signaling (i.e., high antigen dose and strong peptide affinity) was also shown to be critical for IRF4 expression in CD8+ T cells. Here we have extended previous findings by demonstrating that IRF4 expression is also modulated by cytokine signaling (i.e., type I IFNs). Of note, high\u2010dose antigen stimulation has been shown to favor IL\u201010 production by CD4+ T cells 44. We have shown previously that IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells was highly restricted to the early time frame following virus\u2010specific T\u2010cell infiltration to the lungs during influenza infection 8, at the time when virus\u2010derived antigens are plentiful in the infected lungs. Thus, it is possible that both TCR\u2010derived signaling and type\u2010I\u2010IFN\u2010derived signaling are required for the optimal induction of IRF4 and downstream IL\u201010 production in vivo.

For IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201010 staining, T cells were harvested at day 4 of the culture and restimulated with PMA (100 ng/mL, Sigma) or inomycin (1 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma) in the presence of Golgi\u2010Stop (1 \u03bcl/mL, BD Biosciences) for 4 h. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) was performed as we previously reported 6. To measure T\u2010cell cytokine production by ELISA, day 4 cultured T cells were restimulated with plate bound \u03b1\u2010CD3 (1 \u03bcg/mL) for overnight. Supernatants were then measured by ELISA as previously described 6. The concentrations of the cytokines used in the culture are as following: recombinant human IL\u20102 (300 U/mL), mouse IL\u201027 (Biolegend, 10 ng/mL), and IFN\u2010\u03b1A (R&D, 250 U/mL), respectively.",
