Specifically, besides the topic distribution, the order of topic segments is also an essential part of document semantic information [18]. Even with the same topic distribution, different orders might represent different or even opposite standpoints. For example, a commentary at the end often determines the guidance of the public opinion, such as the coverage of politics, in particular, election campaigns [6, 12]. The challenge of this task is to ensure both the coherency and the saliency of the topic segments, where the coherency refers to keeping long topic segments without being split, while the saliency reserving short topic segments without being absorbed with longer ones.",

Nevertheless, the \u201cbag of words\u201d based models are unable to capture the order of topics within each document. A simple solution is to consider the physical structure [2] (e.g., sentences and paragraphs) of each document and use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) structure [4, 9, 21, 23, 24] or predefine a common canonical topic ordering to model the order of topics [8]. However, in recent decades, massive document data are continuously generated in various forms (e.g., news and postings) and from multiple modes (e.g., voice and video). The above models cannot handle these documents with no physical structure information.",

Detecting and utilizing keywords on the topic assignments improve the coherency of topic segments, especially in documents with well-proportioned topic distribution and sufficient keywords. However, relying heavily on extracted keywords limits the saliency of topic segments. For example, for a document with an uneven topic distribution, extracting enough keywords for all the segments is difficult. As a result, less proportionate topic segments are likely to be absorbed by topic segments with higher proportions, due to insufficient keywords.",

Most words can represent multiple topics, due to their polysemy. The distributional hypothesis [20], which states that words in similar contexts have similar meanings, is one of the primary theories used to quantify the meaning of words according to their context (e.g., Word2vec [11]). Inspired by it, we assume that the topic of each word in a document is related to its context, that is, similar contexts correspond to similar topics. Intuitively, even if a word can be assigned to multiple topics, given its context, we can assign a corresponding topic more certainly. For example, the word \u201cLiverpool\u201d can belong to a topic of sports, geography or art, etc. However, if we combine it to the words in its context (e.g., \u201cLiverpool\u201d & \u201cfootball\u201d or \u201cLiverpool\u201d & \u201cBeatles\u201d), the assignment is much clearer.",

They basically assume that words in the same text-span share the same topic or topic distribution. They conduct segmentation by introducing HMM structure in their topic models and modeling dependencies between consecutive text-spans. However, these approaches are unable to handle data with no structural information, which significantly limits their applicability. Moreover, in most cases, topics might evolve in long paragraphs or sections, and thus a text-span might contain multiple topics.",

            "text": "Recent studies have been focusing on physical structure-independent segmentation [1, 7, 22, 25]. Topic Keyword Model (TKM) [22] is a topic model based on keywords and their contexts. Its main weakness lies in handling short topic segments, which are likely to be absorbed by long topic segments due to their small number of keywords. Biterm Topic Model (BTM) [7] learns topics by modeling the generation of word co-occurrence patterns, which improves the sensitivity of the discovery of phrases in short text data. On the basis of the former, Bursty Biterm Topic Model (BBTM) introduces a new variable to discover bursty topics1 [25]. These phrase-level topic modeling methods can achieve good results in discovering word co-occurrence patterns in individual short documents and require no physical structure information. However, high-frequency phrases only make up a tiny proportion of the corpus, which limits their ability to generate coherent topics in topic segmentation tasks. The main difference from our model is that they consider all distinct word pairs of each fixed-size window, while we focus on the topic-specific word pairs, which only concern the target word in the corresponding context. Copula LDA with Segmentation (SegLDA) [1] is an LDA-based model which automatically segments documents into topically coherent sequences of words. SegLDA predefines segments for each document before modeling. For each word in a segment, a topic is assigned either from the segment-specific topic distribution or the document-specific topic distribution. These distributions differentiate the main topics of a document from potential segment-specific topics, which improves the saliency of short segments. However, the two distributions are independent. Specifically, in the former distribution, a topic assignment depends only on the words within the segment, which leads to a loss of much context information in the original document.",

Although the constraints of topic distribution can alleviate the uncertainty in the topic assignment, it is still insufficient to handle documents containing multiple main topics. For example, a document on the study of modern football and the geographical distribution of England, should at least belong to two topics (geography and sports). We study the topic assignment of the word \u201cLiverpool\u201d in a specific location and consider its 3 related topics: sports, geography, and art. As shown in Fig. 1, for traditional topic models, although the topic distribution reduces the probability of being assigned to the topic of \u201cart\u201d, there is still a large uncertainty between \u201csports\u201d and \u201cgeography\u201d. However, by considering the frequency of co-occurrence of context words on various topics, this uncertainty can be further reduced, which also coincides with the distributional hypothesis.",

Although we might be able to specify a good K value beforehand, the difference in the number of topics contained in each document also leads to the inevitability of generating redundant segments. Therefore, merging redundant segments with frequent ones is indispensable, where the key is to judge whether the resulting segment has a higher coherency than the original ones. The TCR is a coherency measurement based on the ratio of word pairs and words instead of relying solely on their frequencies. This property ensures the coherency of segments are independent of their lengths; thus, we design a TCR based Redundant Topic Merging (RTM) algorithm to optimize the generated topic segments. The steps of RTM are: for each topic segment, we consider three cases: (1) merging with the previous segment; (2) merging with the next segment; (3) non-merging. For these three cases, the TCRs are calculated separately and the case with the highest ratio is selected. We repeat the above steps until the number of segments stays unchanged.",

We see that C-LDA shows the best results on all six datasets and more significant improvements in data sets with more complex topic structures (Wici+, Wile+, Cell+), which proves the validity of our model for generating coherent topics. A possible reason is that C-LDA combines the frequency of context word pairs for each topic in modeling, while the other models (such as TKM) either consider only the words frequency in each topic or the frequency of all word pairs in individual documents (such as BTM). Moreover, semantic expressions in a document are usually coherent and segmented, e.g., paragraphs and sections, thus, considering the context in a topic assignment can clarify the semantics of the word, so as to reduce the risk of splitting a coherent semantic segment.\n",

Therefore, its effect on the topic coherency is achieved by increasing the joint probability of each word pair and topics. The high frequent word pairs in a corpus are of high joint probabilities. However, in a corpus, the majority are ordinary words but not word pairs, and their topic assignments are still of high uncertainty. Besides, the computation of all distinct word pairs significantly increases its training time. TKM improves the coherency of topic segmentation by considering the influence of keywords on the topic assignment of surrounding words and cost the least time. However, short topic segments with insufficient keywords are likely to be absorbed by long topic segments, which is a possible reason of its low performance. In some cases of insufficient topic number (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$K=50$$\\end{document}), SegLDA outperforms other methods. However, as K increased from 50 to 100, its performance growth is inferior to C-LDA. For SegLDA, the topics for words in a segment can be assigned from the segment-specific topic distribution, which improves the saliency of topic segments. However, assigning topics without considering the original document can lead to a loss of context information and degrade the accuracy of topic modeling. That is, a word is possibly assigned to an incorrect topic even if it is not absorbed by others. C-LDA considers both the contextual word pairs and topic distribution. Based on the reorganized topic distribution CTD, it reduces the uncertainty of the topic assignment and increases the joint probability of consecutive words sharing the same topic at the expense of increasing time consumption. Moreover, comparing the results of the original and their extended datasets, we see our method has stronger robustness to more complex topic structures, which also leads to better applicability.\n",
