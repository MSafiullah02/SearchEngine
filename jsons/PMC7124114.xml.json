            "text": "Pulmonary parasitic lung diseases are commonly diagnosed in countries where the prevalence of parasitic infection is high. However, there is an increase in the number of patients diagnosed as parasitic lung diseases recently, even in countries of low prevalence of parasitic infection which demands an awareness of such diseases in these countries. This increase in diagnosis in countries with low prevalence with parasitic infections has been attributed to an increase in the numbers of immunosuppressed individuals due to various reasons, organ transplantations and global travel [1]. The parasites can cause a wide spectrum of lung diseases varying from mild self-limiting bronchitis to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome [2]. In addition, parasitic lung diseases may mimic diseases such as bacterial pneumonias, pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchial asthma, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. Both protozoal and helminthic parasites can cause lung diseases and helminthic lung infections are important causes of eosinophilic lung diseases [3]. Though the treatment of parasitic lung diseases is with specific antiparasitic drugs, the physicians treating such diseases should be competent in tackling the specific issues related to lung injury and sequel that may follow such infections. The lung diseases that may result from infections with parasites are listed in Table 1.1 [4].\n",

            "text": "Amebiasis results from ingestion of mature Entamoeba histolytica cysts in fecally contaminated food, water or from hands. Infection with Entamoeba histolytica can lead to intestinal colonization, colitis or extraintestinal manifestations resulting from the hematogenous spread of infection from the intestine. About 90 % of intestinal colonization is with nonpathogenic species, Entamoeba dispar and Entamoeba moshkovskii. Invasive amebiasis occurs in 10 % of persons colonized with E. histolytica. Patients with amebic colitis present with several-week history of cramping abdominal pain, weight loss, and watery or bloody diarrhea. Extraintestinal amebic infection can manifest as amebic liver abscess, splenic abscess, brain abscess, empyema, and pericarditis. Nearly 80 % of cases of amebic liver abscesses occur in the right lobe. The most common complication of amebic liver abscess is rupture into the pleural space resulting in pleuropulmonary amebiasis [5]. The main symptoms in pleuropulmonary amebiasis are fever, cough, hemoptysis, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and chest pain. Some patients may present with respiratory distress and shock. Lung abscess, hepatobronchial fistula, and bronchopleural fistula with pyopneumothorax have also been reported. Expectoration of anchovy sauce-like pus indicates amebiasis [6]. The findings of elevated hemidiaphragm, tender hepatomegaly, pleural effusion, and basal pulmonary involvement are suggestive of pleuropulmonary amebiasis. Amebiasis can be suspected in patients with a history of immigration from or travel to developing countries and many patients give history of dysentery and alcoholism.",

            "text": "Amebiasis is commonly diagnosed by microscopy and cysts or motile trophozoites can be identified on a saline wet mount of a stool specimen [7]. Microscopic examination of fresh stools, sputum or pleural pus, rectal smears or rectosigmoidoscopy materials, pus from liver abscesses, and colonic biopsy samples may reveal motile trophozoites, even though it is a relatively specific test but is not sensitive for the identification of E. histolytica. The presence of ameba in the stool does not indicate that the disease is due to pathogenic E. histolytica as two other nonpathogenic species found in humans (E. dispar and E. moshkovskii) are indistinguishable morphologically [8, 9]. This method can, therefore, give false-positive results if Entamoeba dispar or Entamoeba moshkovskii infection is present. However, it has been reported recently that several different genotypes of E. dispar can be potentially responsible for tissue damage similar to that observed with E. histolytica [10]. A nonpathogenic Entamoeba gingivalis which is present in the oral cavity has to be differentiated from Entamoeba histolytica in sputum samples. A combination of serological tests with identification of the parasite by antigen detection by PCR is the best approach to diagnosis.",

            "text": "In vitro culture by inoculation of portions of stool, liver abscess, or empyema fluid into sterile culture media and incubating it at 37 \u00b0C is also useful in the diagnosis of amebiasis. The culture media is examined for the growth of amebic trophozoites, which, if present, can be seen on the walls of test tubes or in debris [11]. Antibody detection and antigen detection are other important immunodiagnostic methods. Indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test is used for routine serodiagnosis of amebiasis. Antigen consists of a crude soluble extract of axenically cultured organisms. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test detects antibody specific for E. histolytica in approximately 95 % of patients with extraintestinal amebiasis, 70 % of patients with active intestinal infection, and 10 % of asymptomatic persons who are passing cysts of E. histolytica. Detectable E. histolytica-specific antibodies may persist for years after successful treatment, so the presence of antibodies does not necessarily indicate acute or current infection. Specificity is 95 % or higher and false-positive reactions rarely occur. E. histolytica-specific antigen detection may be useful as an adjunct to microscopic diagnosis in detecting parasites and to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic infections. Detection of circulating antigens in the serum has been found to be an important advancement in the diagnosis [12]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are useful for the differentiation of E. histolytica, E. dispar, and E. moshkovskii and for genetic typing of isolates [13, 14]. However, these tests are time-consuming and expensive and, hence, are not practical in areas endemic for amebiasis.",

Leishmaniasis has also been reported in lung transplant patients [17]. Leishmania amastigotes can be found in the alveoli, pulmonary septa, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Diagnosis of leishmaniasis is by the demonstration of the parasites in bone marrow aspirates and by the identification of specific DNA sequences in tissues by molecular biology techniques [18]. The differential diagnosis of leishmaniasis includes malaria, cirrhosis with portal hypertension, miliary tuberculosis, brucellosis, histoplasmosis, lymphoma, and leukemia [19].",

The smears can be stained with Romnowsky\u2019s, hematoxylin-eosin, or immunoperoxidase stains. The amastigote stage seen in clinical samples is known as Leishman-Donovan (LD) bodies. The amastigotes observed in the smears have to be differentiated from \u201cdot\u201d-like structures (e.g., Histoplasma spp., platelets) by looking for the characteristic size (2\u20134 mm in diameter), shape (round to oval), and the internal organelles (the nucleus and kinetoplast). Culture of these specimens on solid NNN medium will demonstrate promastigotes. Immunological methods of diagnosis include indirect fluorescent test (IFA), direct agglutination test (DAT), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies against Leishmania [20]. Antigen detection tests are better means of diagnosis of active leishmaniasis [21]. The antigen detection is the ideal test in immunocompromised patients, where antibody response is very poor. PCR is found to be the most sensitive and specific molecular test and is useful in molecular epidemiological studies besides diagnosis [22].",

Five species of malarial parasites (Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi) infect man [23]. The main symptoms of malaria are periodic fever, chills, malaise, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting, usually manifesting 10\u201315 days after mosquito bite. Anemia and splenomegaly are other important findings in malaria. Falciparum malaria is the most deadly type. The pulmonary manifestations range from cough to severe and rapidly fatal non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fig. 1.1) [24]. Acute lung injury and ARDS have also been reported to occur in infection with P. vivax and P. ovale [25, 26]. There has been no convincing evidence for the existence of true malarial pneumonitis, and if it occurs, it may be due to viral and secondary bacterial infections. Diffusing capacity was significantly impaired in patients with severe malaria. In addition to ARDS, falciparum malaria can cause many other severe complications such as cerebral malaria, acute renal failure, severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and gastrointestinal, hepatic, and metabolic complications [27].\n",

Microscopic diagnosis is based on staining thick and thin blood films on a glass slide to visualize the malaria parasite [28]. It is inexpensive, able to differentiate malaria species and quantify parasites. The detection threshold in Giemsa-stained thick blood film has been estimated to be 4\u201320 parasites/\u03bcL. Plasmodium species can be correctly recognized in thin blood film. Sometimes malarial parasites cannot be detected in peripheral blood smear, but malaria pigments may be seen in circulating phagocytic leukocytes. This is a pathognomonic sign of recent infection. The parasite count, number of circulating pigment-containing phagocytes, and the presence of late asexual stages of the parasite observed in the blood smear are all positively correlated with a fatal outcome. Bone marrow aspirate can also demonstrate malarial parasites, if thin smears of the peripheral blood do not show the parasites. Quantitative buffy coat (QBC) method involves staining parasite deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in micro-hematocrit tubes with fluorescent dyes (e.g., acridine orange) and its subsequent detection by epifluorescent microscopy. The parasite nuclei fluoresces bright green and the cytoplasm appears yellow-orange [29].",

The intermediate hosts including man are infected by ingestion of eggs excreted in the feces of the dogs. Primary pulmonary cystic hydatid disease is usually single. Multiple cysts may be seen in 20 % of cases and may be unilateral or bilateral [2]. Secondary metastatic pulmonary cystic hydatid disease may occur by the rupture of a liver cyst in vena caval circulation or a heart cyst in the right ventricular cavity. Patients are asymptomatic in the initial stages of infection. Pulmonary symptoms include cough, fever, dyspnea, and chest pain [40]. Signs and symptoms can occur due to compression of adjacent tissue by the cysts. Rupture of the cysts into a bronchus may result in hemoptysis and expectoration of cystic fluid containing parasite membrane and can cause anaphylactic shock, respiratory distress, asthma-like symptoms, persistent pneumonia, and sepsis [41, 42]. Rupture of the cyst into the pleural space can result in hydropneumothorax, pleural effusion, and empyema. Diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid cyst is based on thoracic imaging studies (chest radiography, thoracic computerized tomography (CT), and thoracic ultrasonography) [43] and an uncomplicated cyst presents as a well-defined homogenous round (cannonball) opacity that may be lobulated by contiguous bronchovascular axes (Fig. 1.2) [2]. Chest radiographs show solitary or multiple round opacities that may mimic lung tumors. CT is helpful in doubtful cases, because the internal structure of the cyst can be analyzed and its density measured. CT is also useful to assess the state of the neighboring parenchyma and to evaluate the whole thorax and abdomen for associated cystic lesions or anomalies. Ultrasonography using a portable ultrasound scanner has been found as reliable, inexpensive, and rapid technique in community-based screening surveys for cystic hydatid disease. The crescent sign, Cumbo\u2019s sign (onion peel sign), water lily sign, and air-fluid level are seen on chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) [41]. Inverse crescent sign, signet ring sign, and serpent sign are recognized as features of pulmonary hydatid cysts in computerized tomogram.\n",

It can metastasize to distant organs mainly to lungs, brain, and bones [46]. Lung involvement results from metastatic dissemination or direct extension through the diaphragm of hepatic echinococcosis with intrathoracic rupture into the bronchial tree, pleural cavity, or mediastinum. Direct extension to the right atrium through the inferior vena cava with recurrent episodes of pulmonary embolism has also been reported. Imaging studies with radiography, ultrasonography, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help in the diagnosis of metastatic lung disease [2].

Adult worms live in the lungs and the eggs are voided in sputum or feces. The man gets infection, when raw or undercooked crabs or crayfishes infected with infective metacercariae are ingested. The parasite from the human gut passes through several organs and tissues to reach the lung. Pulmonary paragonimiasis manifests as fever, chest pain, chronic cough, and blood-tinged sputum [57]. The cough is dry at first and later productive with blood-stained, rusty-brown tenacious sputum. Occasionally, there is profuse hemoptysis. Pulmonary paragonimiasis is confused with tuberculosis as the symptoms in both diseases are similar. Chest radiographs may show infiltrative, nodular, and cavitating shadows. Pleural effusion or pneumothorax is an important finding in paragonimiasis [58, 59]. CT scan may show single or multiple nodules in the lung parenchyma, calcified spots and pleural thickening with interlobar pleuritis, and pleural effusion. MRI may show conglomerated lesions with hemorrhage or tunnel signs.",

Loffler\u2019s syndrome is a self-limiting inflammation of the lungs and is associated with blood and lung eosinophilia.

The respiratory symptoms include chest pain, cough with mucoid sputum, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and wheezing [62]. There may be rapid respiratory rate and rales can be heard on auscultation. Leukocytosis particularly eosinophilia is an important laboratory finding. Chest radiographs demonstrate unilateral or bilateral, transient, migratory, and non-segmental opacities of various sizes. These opacities are often peripherally situated and appear to be pleural based [63]. The severity of symptoms will depend upon the larval burden.

TPE is a systemic disease involving mainly the lungs, but other organs such as liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, and gastrointestinal tract may also be involved. The disease occurs predominantly in males, with a male to female ratio of 4:1, and is mainly seen in older children and young adults between the ages 15 and 40 years. The systemic symptoms include fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Patients with TPE usually present with respiratory symptoms that include paroxysmal cough, breathlessness, and wheeze and chest pain [81, 82]. The symptoms occur predominantly at night, but can persist during the day. Severe cough can lead to fractured ribs. Sputum is usually scanty, viscous, and mucoid. The sputum often shows clumps of eosinophils, and rarely Charcot-Leyden crystals are observed. On examination, patients are often breathless. Bilateral scattered rhonchi and rales may be heard on auscultation [61, 78].",

Twenty percent of patients have a normal chest radiograph. In patients with a long-standing history, a few patients have honeycomb lungs. Radiological improvement occurs on specific therapy with DEC, but some degree of radiological abnormality persists in some patients. Lung function tests reveal mainly a restrictive ventilation defect with superimposed airway obstruction [84, 85]. Single breath carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) is reduced in 88 % of untreated patients with TPE. The reduction in TLCO is due to reduced pulmonary membrane diffusing capacity (Dm) [86]. The criteria suggested for the diagnosis of TPE are (a) appropriate exposure history (mosquito bite) in an endemic area of filariasis, (b) a history of paroxysmal nocturnal cough and breathlessness, (c) chest radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrations, (d) leukocytosis in blood, (e) peripheral blood eosinophils more than 3,000 cells per cu mm, (f) elevated serum IgE levels, (g) elevated serum antifilarial antibodies (IgG and/or IgE), and (h) a clinical response to diethylcarbamazine citrate [87, 88].\n",

Nearly 50 % of subjects infected with dirofilariasis are asymptomatic. Clinical symptoms are chest pain, cough, fever, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. CT scan may show a well-defined nodule with smooth margin connected to an arterial branch [90]. Positron emission tomography scan can demonstrate hypermetabolic activity in a pulmonary infarct secondary to dirofilariasis [91]. A PCR-based diagnosis of D. repens in human pulmonary dirofilariasis has been reported [92].

The common symptoms of trichinellosis are muscle pain, periorbital edema, fever, and diarrhea [98]. Pulmonary symptoms include dyspnea, cough, and pulmonary infiltrates. Dyspnea may be due to the involvement of diaphragm [99]. Leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated levels of serum muscle enzymes (creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and amino transferase) are important laboratory findings. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-Trichinella antibodies using excretory-secretary antigens may be useful in the diagnosis.
