While higher income countries already apprehending worse recession and socioeconomic setbacks, low-and-middle income countries like India is high likely to face the worse. Many already proven social factors like: being sick, prolonged hospitalization, death of loved ones, loss of job, months of forced quarantine, lack of supply, stigma -is likely to hit us all, especially those who are more vulnerable to stress and already suffering from mental illness (Mak et al., 2009; Brooks et al., 2020) (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 112, "text": "(Dong and Bouey, 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 234, "end": 254, "text": "(Goyal et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 714, "end": 732, "text": "(Mak et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 733, "end": 753, "text": "Brooks et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 184, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 754, "end": 763, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Sir,"}, {"text": "We are among few, in our institute, being involved since beginning in active management of COVID-19 cases.
