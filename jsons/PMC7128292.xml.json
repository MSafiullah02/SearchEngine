The emergence of new diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS and SARS, and the rise of the new influenza strains H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9, as well as other respiratory pathogens such as the novel coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, represent a few examples of the global problems facing public health and medical science researchers. Even though pathogens such as the SARS coronavirus and H5N1 had a limited impact in terms of mortality, their sudden appearance has shown how abruptly health emergencies on a global scale can arise.",

One of the major issues is that, for diseases such as influenza\u2010like illness (ILI), only an unknown proportion of all infected individuals see a doctor. In addition, consultations frequently occur with a considerable delay, taking place only when a complication has occurred or a doctor's certificate is required (for example, in Sweden such a certificate is not required until after 1 week of absence from work). Other issues concern: the time delay in data reporting and aggregation; the lack of information on the patterns of household transmission; the lack of uniform standards for clinical definitions, which may vary considerably between countries and even between reporters (European Influenza Surveillance Network). Furthermore, age\u2010stratified rates of physician consultation may vary widely with different healthcare and health insurance systems. Healthcare\u2010seeking behaviour can change unpredictably during an epidemic, making extrapolations of those statistics to the general population uncertain.",

The purpose was to inform the general population about influenza by means of a self\u2010reporting Internet platform in Dutch (http://www.degrotegriepmeting.nl), where volunteers in The Netherlands and Belgium (the Flemish part) could answer socio\u2010demographic, medical and behavioural questions, and report their influenza\u2010related symptoms each week. User participation was achieved through targeted communication and recruitment. A positive side effect of this project was the collection of almost real\u2010time data about influenza, including from individuals who did not visit a doctor when ill. Knowledge of volunteers' postal codes allowed the real\u2010time collection of data at the postal code level. Thanks to a vigorous communication campaign using both online and offline media, the project attracted 20 000 users during this first season.",

In Portugal, during the first 2 years of the project, approximately 5000 volunteers were attracted 3. On the basis of this success, the computational epidemiology group of the ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy decided to deploy a similar platform during the winter of 2007, to carry out influenza surveillance with the aim of informing computational models for studying the spread of ILI on a large scale. Data collected by these four platforms have been evaluated 3, 4 (Paolotti et al., 3rd International ICST Conference on Electronic Healthcare for the 21st Century, 2010, Abstract no. 30), and the estimated seasonal influenza incidence curves have been found to be in good agreement with those from the former European Influenza Surveillance Scheme.",

The proposed network of web platforms, called Influenzanet (http://www.influenzanet.eu), saw, for the first time, the collaboration of epidemiologists, public health practitioners and modellers with the aim of collecting epidemiological data in real time through the contributions of Internet volunteers self\u2010selected from among the general population. The epidemiology teams devised reference standard questionnaires for different diseases to collect unified data across European countries (presented in the supporting information). ILI has been the focus in the early deployment of the system, but the final goal is to considerably enlarge the portfolio of diseases and health conditions monitored. In June 2009, the plans to export the platform to other European countries were accelerated by the unfolding of the H1N1 pandemic in the northern hemisphere. A web system very similar to the Italian platform was rapidly deployed in the UK (https://flusurvey.org.uk/) to capture the whole progress of the H1N1 pandemic, with the involvement of the mathematical modelling group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This work allowed researchers to detect the differences in healthcare\u2010seeking behaviour between different population groups and changes over time, with significant implications for estimates of total case numbers and the case\u2010fatality rate 5, 6.",

The national platforms collect data about the health status of the active cohort volunteers during the whole duration of the influenza season. Participants are considered to be active if they have completed, on average, at least one symptoms questionnaire every 3 weeks since the registration. To define ILI, the following ILI case definition is used, which resembles the WHO guidelines 10: a sudden onset of fever, namely, a measured body temperature of \u226538\u00b0C, accompanied by headache or muscle pain, and accompanied by cough or a sore throat.
