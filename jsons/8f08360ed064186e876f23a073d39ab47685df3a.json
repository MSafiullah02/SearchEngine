This fact has to 33 be particularly emphasized more than ever, as all aspects of our daily life and its measurable activities, 34 for better and worse, are being generated and recorded to be part of the collection -known as the 35 BIG DATA. 36 37 Sharing data is vital for a community of shared future 38 Sharing data begins with building a willful and dedicated community who consents a shared future 39 at a global scale. On the one hand, public emergencies, such as epidemics and pandemics caused by 40 many emerging infectious diseases, especially the two-in-a-row coronaviruses, severe acute 41 respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 [1], often necessitate data sharing 42 to aid expedited translation of big data into knowledge and procedures to improve human health. On 43 the other hand, we are now being, and increasingly so, armed and empowered by many data-44 generating engines and tools, including high-throughput sequencing technologies and high-45 performance computing platforms, as well as their collaborative products -large-scale genomic big 46 data that are generated at exponentially growing rates; most of the data are being continuously 47 produced, often supported by public funding [2,3]. Clearly, data sharing becomes pivotal for many 48 considerations and plans for action in public emergencies, since the outcomes from data-sharing are 49 of essence in yielding a complete picture of emergency situation, accelerating scientific research and 50 knowledge discovery, and promoting sensible and expeditious decision-making as well. 51 Unfortunately, existing practices surrounding data sharing are not effective in achieving 52 maximum interests from our investments. Data sharing is hindered or slowed down by a lack of clear 53 identification of supporting elements for its implementation. What constitutes 'the elements of data 54 sharing' is, however, largely undefined. Therefore, clarifying and defining data-sharing elements 55 would be of fundamental significance. Especially, when the world faces unprecedented global threats 56 and encounters public emergency situations (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 has spread around more than 200 57 countries/regions with 2,213,653 infected cases and 154,462 deaths as of 18 April 2020), we, as a 58 community of shared future, need to specify vital elements of data sharing and establish rapid, open, 59 and effective data release norms. 60 61",
