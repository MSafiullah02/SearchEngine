Types of facilities can be classified by size of enrollment, age of enrollees, and environmental characteristics of the facility. Grouping of children by age varies by setting, but in organized care facilities children usually are separated into the following groups: infants (6 weeks through 12 months), toddlers (13 through 35 months), preschoolers (36 months through 59 months), and school-aged children (5 through 12 years). These designations have relevance to infectious disease epidemiology as well as regulation and monitoring. Most nonrelative care provided in an organized care facility is subject to state licensing and regulation, whereas care by a relative in a child's or provider's home is usually not subject to state regulations and monitoring.",

After 2 cases of STEC were identified at a childcare center in Norway, an outbreak investigation found 9 additional cases among the 91 children enrolled and 1 case among the 41 employees; no evidence of common exposures was found, and person-to-person transmission was determined to be likely.

Childcare attendance and age <60 months were associated with illness in a community outbreak of S. sonnei among traditionally observant Jewish children in New York City in 2000.38 Multiple illnesses in a single household were determined to result from intrahousehold secondary transmission. A multicommunity outbreak of more than 1600 culture-confirmed cases in the greater metropolitan area of Cincinnati, Ohio in 2001 had an overall mean attack rate of 10% among childcare center enrollees. The highest attack rates occurred among newly or incompletely toilet-trained enrollees, and the lowest attack rates were noted among diapered children. The attack rate was 6% among staff members. Secondary transmission was facilitated by poor hygiene practices, including inaccessible handwashing supplies and incomplete diaper disposal practices, as well as through recreational activities involving water.18 A prolonged multistate increase of shigellosis caused by organisms with similar biochemical and genetic profiles occurred in the South and mid-Atlantic areas in 2001 to 2003. A substantial proportion of infections was associated with group childcare.39 In 2005, 639 cases of multidrug-resistant S. sonnei were reported in northwest Missouri. A case-control investigation of 39 licensed childcare centers demonstrated that centers with \u22651 sink or a diapering station in each room were less likely to have cases, thus reinforcing the importance of environmental design and hygiene in reducing the propagation of shigellosis in childcare centers.40 An observational study following a shigellosis outbreak in St. Louis, Missouri examined the utility of requiring a second negative convalescent stool culture among those excluded from work or childcare. Of the 172 people who submitted at least 2 follow-up cultures, the probability that S. sonnei was isolated from a second culture after being isolated from a first culture was 7%. All (100%) of the second cultures from people who had a first negative follow-up culture result were without growth of S. sonnei, a finding suggesting that a single negative convalescent culture result is sufficient to document clearance.41\n",

Universal immunization of infants with HBV vaccine in 1991 has reduced to negligible the potential for horizontal HBV transmission in the childcare setting. Because the highest concentrations of HBV in infected people are found in blood and blood-containing body fluids, the most common and efficient routes of transmission are through percutaneous blood exposure, by sexual exposure, and perinatally. However, high levels of HBV DNA have been detected in the saliva of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)\u2013positive children, a finding suggesting that exposure to saliva could be a means of horizontal transmission.112 Thus, if a known hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier bites and breaks the skin of a hepatitis B\u2013unimmunized child, hepatitis B immune globulin and the HBV vaccine series should be administered to the hepatitis B\u2013unimmunized child.113 The transmission risk of HCV infection in childcare settings is unknown.

Guidelines to reduce opportunities for transmission and infection have been developed to prevent disease transmission in many of these settings.135, 136 Inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal supervision of children's activities following animal contact, and hand-to-mouth activities following animal contact are risk factors for infection.

A retrospective cohort study of children 12 to 60 months of age attending childcare in and around Quebec City, Canada found that transmission of acute gastroenteritis and acute respiratory illness from children to their parents occurred in about 1 in every 3 episodes of infection.139 During outbreaks of diarrhea in childcare centers, 40% of childcare providers developed diarrhea.17 During a multicommunity outbreak of shigellosis, the overall median attack rate among employed staff members of childcare centers was 6%, with a range of 0% to 17%.18 In outbreaks of group A Streptococcus and echovirus 30 infection in childcare centers, adult providers and parents were affected.96 Similar prevalence rates of pneumococcal colonization (5% among adult employees of childcare centers with child contact and 5% among nonclinical employees at a tertiary care center) were noted in a study performed in 2003 in Galveston, Texas; these data suggest that childcare providers are not at an increased risk for pneumococcal colonization in the universal PCV era.140 Compared with nonproviders, childcare providers have a significantly higher annual risk of at least 1 infectious disease and loss of workdays as a result of infectious disease.141 Childcare providers should receive all immunizations routinely recommended for adults.142\n",

A prospective evaluation of 208 families with at least 1 childcare enrollee that was conducted from November 2000 to May 2001 in the Boston area documented 2072 viral illnesses over 105,352 person-days. Among the 834 subjects, 1683 upper respiratory tract infections and 389 gastrointestinal tract illnesses were reported during the study period, with a total mean cost of $49 per respiratory tract infection and $56 per gastrointestinal illness. Decreased parental productivity during missed days of work to care for a child who had to be withdrawn from childcare accounted for a significant proportion of the nonmedical cost.143 Another prospective study of 381 children attending childcare centers in Sydney, Australia in 2010 found that the mean cost of an influenza-like illness was AU$626 (95% CI, AU$484\u2013768); independent drivers of cost were both parents being employed and longer duration of illness.146\n",
