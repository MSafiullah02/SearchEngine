Showers and taps can be the sources of risk for aerosolization of fungal spores (Anaissie et al. 2003). Moulds are ubiquitous in nature and grow almost anywhere indoors or outdoors. Persons can be exposed to mould through skin contact, inhalation or ingestion. Because of the ubiquity of mould in the environment, some level of exposure is inevitable. Inhalation is usually presumed to be the most important mechanism of exposure to viable (live) or nonviable (dead) fungi, fungal fragments or components. The majority of fungal spores have aerodynamic diameters of 2\u201310 \u00b5m, which are in the size range that allow particles to be deposited in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Inhalation exposure to a fungal spore requires that the spore be initially aerosolized at the site of growth. In general, persons with impaired host defences suffer the most severe types of fungal infections.",

Other than numerous pathogenic opportunistic species were isolated (Alternaria infectoria, Alternaria tenuissima, Epicoccum nigrum, Purpureocillum lilacinum, Cryptococcus laurentii), many other environmental opportunistic fungi belonging to the genera Penicillum, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Mucor, Stemphylium, Conidiobolus and Trichoderma were found. Bacterial densities in bioaerosol ranged from 9 to 174 cfu/m3 with the highest values characterizing an emergency room. Staphylococcus aureus and other opportunistic Staphylococcus species were isolated in many areas. Several bacterial opportunistic species were also recovered (Leclercia adecarboxylata, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus and Kokuria varians). In general, a moderate microbial pollution affected the examined surfaces with the exception of a massive bacterial density (>1 \u00d7 103 cfu/cm2) observed on a drug carriage where Pseudomonas stutzeri, opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, was isolated as prevalent microbial species (Bonadonna et al. 2015).",
