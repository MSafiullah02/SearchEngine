In this study, we proposed a new concept of environmental infection rate (R E ), based on floating time of respiratory droplets in the air and inactivation rate of virus to solve the problem. More than half of the particles in the droplets can float in the atmosphere for 1-2 hours. The prediction results showed that high R E values (>3.5) are scattered around 30\u00b0N in winter (Dec.",

A key parameter for model prediction is the basic reproduction rate (R 0 ), which is usually estimated with various types of complex mathematical models. The R 0 value is affected by biological (cell structure 11 and concentrations of virus, immunity of susceptible population, etc), socio-behavioral 12, 13 and environmental factors 14 . Because environmental factors are different in regions and time, it may be unsuitable for the applicability of R 0 outside the region where it was calculated 15 . Actually, many studies have found close correlation of epidemic development with environmental factors such as wind, temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) [6] [7] [8] , which affects viable virus concentrations and exposure time of virus to susceptible population. Here, a new reproduction rate that depends on environmental factors (T and RH), environmental reproduction rate (R E ), was introduced. Using R E , it is possible for us to predict the epidemic development with time (season) and places (countries) of a specific respiratory disease.",

Droplets do not evaporate completely in the air because they contain substances such as salts and proteins 19 . The number of droplet particles at 2-12 microns (\u03bcm) ejected during speaking, coughing, sneezing accounts for more than 90%, and the initial particle size (d 0 ) of the peak number is 7-10\u03bcm 20 (Fig.   2a ). Droplet particles of large size (>100\u03bcm) settled rapidly due to gravity. The droplet particles of small size reached an equilibrium particle size (d eq ) rapidly (in a few seconds 14, 19 ) and floated in the air for some time (t) depending on RH (Fig. 2b) . When RH is <95%, the main natural weather conditions, the settling of >90% droplet particles may take more than 5 hours (Fig. 3) . For 10-50\u03bcm (d 0 ) droplets, the exposure risk under low RH (60%) is more than 20 times larger than that at RH 100% (Fig. 4 ). The 7-10\u03bcm (d 0 ) droplets, floated in the air for up to 1-2 hours under RH 60%, are the most important vector of virus transmission (Fig. 5a ). Here we used the floating time of 10\u03bcm droplets in the R E estimation. When RH is in the range of 50-100%, the floating time (t, min) of droplets with initial particle size (d 0 ) of 10\u03bcm in the air is a function of RH (Fig. 5a 19 . The t 1/2 of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols is 1.1 hours 20 , similar to the floating time of 7-10\u03bcm particles in the air under RH 60% (Fig. 2a) , indicating that ~ half of viruses died during settling from the air in dry weather.",

So we believed that half of susceptible population (young and half the middle-aged) in the city was not involved (g = 0.5). The age structure of cases changed after January 23. For example, according to the epidemiological survey data in Guangdong and Sichuan provinces (China) 16 , among all the 1,836 cases, 1,308 cases were associated with 344 times of aggregation (1 person infected 3 people), and about 3/4 of the cases confirmed were mainly in the family. The age structure of the cases is very consistent with the age structure and family member structure of China and the two provinces (Fig. 5c) . Therefore, 3/4 of the susceptible population were isolated at home during this period, i.e. g = 0.25. After gating communities on February 14, the number of people who appeared in public places decreased sharply to 1/8 (one person from one family went out on the second day), and thus g was 0.125 (Fig. 5d) . Additionally, in the R E estimation we increased the g value on some days due to special events, e.g. buying food on weekends (custom) before locking down the city, outdoor activities on sunny day of January 28 after a long period of rain and a claim on returning to work on February 14 (canceled on February 13) (Fig. 5d) .",

Since the R d value was calculated with an assumption that d i is 3 days, the R E value then was 2.8, which is equivalent to the reported R 0 value 3,4 . The 3 days of infection period (d i ) of COVID-19 are considered based on the reports that COVID-19 patients are infectious two days before 16 and one day after onset of illness (Fig. 1a) . The d i value is lower than that reported in ref. 3 (5.2 days). But increasing d i means a decrease in the R d calculated (Fig. 1b; See Method Section), so the R E value does not change much with d i . After home quarantine on January 23, the R E-d averaged 0.25(95% CI: 0.11-0.59) and thus the modeled public infection rate (R E-p , =R E-d \u00d7d i ) was 0.75, corresponding to a declined COVID-19 spread by 73%. After gating communities on February 14, the mean R E-p value dropped to only 0.33, and the disease diminished considerably by 88% (Fig. 5e) , indicating that these control measures are very effective to prevent the spread of the epidemic. In the estimation, we did not consider family cases because they were basically isolated at home, and the infection stopped later. The outbreak of COVID-19 was mainly in China, South Korea, Iran and Italy around 30\u00b0N before March 2020, and spread to almost all parts of the world after March 10 (Fig. 6a) . In Europe, for example, the epicenter was Italy before March. After the 10th day of March, it raged in Western Europe and began to spread in Northern Europe. Global distribution of R E value modeled with 10-day averages of T and RH showed a similar trend. In the modeled R E -distribution maps (Fig. 6b) , regions with the R E values higher than 3.5 are scattered in Europe in early March, while linked together after March 10. This assured us that meteorological conditions in March played an important role in promoting the rapid spread of COVID-19.",

Wind (>3m/s) is effective at blowing away aerosols, so it is unlikely to be infected in windy open areas (Fig. 9 ). Indoor airflow (i.e. caused by air conditioning and walking) can reduce the floating time of droplets and disperse viruses in the air, but also significantly increase exposure chance to viruses. Unless the MID of COVID-19 is small enough, airflow disturbance may not significantly increase the infection rate. So the modeled R E values may be a upper limit. We noticed that the similar half lifetime of SARS-CoV-1 (caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) to SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols 20 , so the spread of the two epidemics should be consistent.
