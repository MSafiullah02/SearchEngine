These compounds have shown efficacy in disrupting the replication pathway, showing antiviral effect. Increasing intracellular Zinc ion and administration of zinc ionophores have been shown to impair replication of a wide range of viruses including rhinoviruses[3], influenza[4], coxsackievirus[5], mengovirus[6], picornavirus[6], herpes[7], and even corona viruses[8]. Krenn et al. demonstrated that two metal ion binding compounds (zinc ionophores), pyrithione and hinokitiol causes a rapid import of extracellular zinc into the cytoplasm. Increased intracellular Zn2+ concentrations have been shown to efficiently impair replication of RNA viruses by interfering with proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins. A study by Te Velthuis et al.[8] has shown that coronavirus replication can be inhibited by increased Zn2+ levels by inhibiting SARS-CoV RdRp activity during the elongation phase of RNA synthesis, without demonstrating detectable cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action is hypothesized that the zinc ions directly affect template binding. However, in other studies, zinc ions seemed to locate into the mitochondria, and the mechanism of inhibition is unclear.[6] Other studies had noted an inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on the activity of purified RdRps from rhinoviruses and hepatitis C virus, but not investigated in any detail.[9], [10]\n",

Zinc supplementation also upregulates A20, a zinc containing transcriptional factor, which inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB [18] which is the prototypical proinflammatory signaling pathway in cellular responses.[19] Downregulating this pathway leads to a decreased generation of inflammatory cytokines. Controlling oxidative stress and chronic inflammation is important because they are contributing factors for several chronic diseases attributed to aging, such as atherosclerosis and related cardiac disorders, cancer, neurodegeneration, immunologic disorders and the aging process itself.[20]\n",

It could penetrate the skin and other membranes without damaging them and could carry components into the biological system. DMSO is commonly used as a solvent to dissolve water-insoluble drugs or test samples in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. DMSO can readily induce oxidative stress, raise oxygen levels, and act as an antiviral agent.[29], [30] This compound has shown to revise septic conditions associated with viral infection-induced dysregulated immuno\u2010inflammatory responses.[31], [32] Mechanistically, DMSO is a potent antioxidant that can regulate transcription factor activation in septic animals, and act as a carrier for other drugs. Several studies have been done on the effect of DMSO infusion for patients with cancer, showing efficacy with limited side effects.[33] Intra-venous infusion of DMSO with sodium bicarbonate brought on symptomatic relief in patients with metastatic prostate cancer,[34] and demonstrated better pain control for refractory cancer pain.[35]\n",
