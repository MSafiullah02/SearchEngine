International health agencies were too sluggish to effect an early resolution. There were no rapid point-of-care diagnostics, no specific treatments, no vaccines, and insufficient medical care facilities, teams, and trained staff, and furthermore the international responses were initially uncoordinated and unable to adapt policies and advice for a very different expression of the disease. As a consequence, aggressive community responses to inappropriate health interventions, foreign aid workers, and researchers unfamiliar with local cultural and health systems norms were common and life-threatening.9, 10 Research to find and evaluate new treatments and vaccines conducted during the EVD epidemic was also slow to start and was dominated by foreign groups with little involvement of local scientists.7, 9 The development and evaluation of experimental tools came too late to benefit the large majority of affected people. Some foreign aid workers and researchers were not familiar with local cultural and medical services norms and aroused local anxieties.10\n",

However, MERS-CoV remains a major global public health threat with continuing reports of new human MERS cases in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims from over 184 countries travel throughout the year.29 Furthermore, a more intensive farm-based camel livestock system has emerged and there is a large, well-established trade in camels between countries at the Horn of Africa and countries in the Middle East. This has increased significantly, particularly following the lifting of the ban on live animal imports from Somalia by Saudi Arabia in 2009/2010. Somalia now exports some five million live animals every year to the Gulf Arab States (including 77 000 camels), making it the single biggest exporter of live animals in the world. The positive experience of reviving Somalia's livestock export industry through increased investment in animal disease prevention and control strategies highlights how effective the \u2018One Health\u2019 approach can be. Most of the African countries do not have the resources, expertise, or capacity, including laboratory facilities, to have active surveillance for MERS-CoV in place. In light of this, the need for increased vigilance and watchful surveillance for MERS-CoV in Sub-Saharan Africa has been highlighted previously.30 Such an initiative could be supported through investments by countries that import large numbers of camels and other livestock from the region.",

The unprecedented outbreak was attributed to poor infection control measures at the hospitals.30 Sequencing studies of the MERS-CoV isolate showed genetic recombination of MERS-CoV in the case exported from Korea to China.32 However, recombination is a frequent event in MERS-CoV and the Korean outbreak is unlikely to represent a special form of the virus. Nonetheless, the potential evolution of MERS-CoV into a more virulent form needs to be monitored closely.",

However, with the continuing, regular reports of community cases of MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia,27 there are no signs of this happening in the near future and lessons must be learnt from the Korean outbreak.34 Whilst there is a growing camel livestock industry in the region, elimination of the virus is unlikely in the short term.",

Urgent definition is required to enable appropriate interventions to be developed for optimal surveillance, laboratory detection, management, prevention, and control in both human and animal populations. Whilst several ad hoc research studies have been conducted and findings published over the past 4 years, more comprehensive investments in tackling MERS-CoV have not been forthcoming. There remain huge knowledge gaps on MERS-CoV. Much of the information that we have about the source of MERS-CoV infections is based on small local studies and it is difficult to develop general country-wide policies without a clear understanding of the zoonotic problem. Questions remain, for example are new local MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia always seeded by the same type of human exposure to camels? Are there particular regions of Africa that provide infected camels to Saudi Arabia? Or is there a general risk from all regions? Is there a way to efficiently control the entry of infected camels? Are animal vaccination strategies economically viable given the large number of imported animals and the frequency of the infection?",

With animal, human, and environmental factors playing a critical role in its evolution, MERS-CoV requires more close collaboration between human and animal health systems and university academics to reduce the risk of pandemic spread.43 Moreover, a better understanding of the agricultural dynamics involved in its persistence and spread in camels and studies on interactions between hosts in the environment are urgently needed. The intermittent detection and reporting of MERS cases in the community and sporadic nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks will require a more coordinated response plan to study clinical cases, conduct translational basic science and clinical trials research, and perform longitudinal sequencing studies from human and camel MERS-CoV isolates. A more collaborative MERS-CoV response plan is required to better define MERS-CoV epidemiology, transmission dynamics, molecular evolution, laboratory capacity, optimal treatment and prevention measures, and development of vaccines for humans and camels.44 A better understanding of the prevailing disease ecology and investigations into the dynamics of infectious agents in wildlife could act as a better means of preventing outbreaks in livestock and people at source.",

This will also devolve current dominance of the global health agenda by Western groups and consortia and allow equitable partnerships to be established with long-term sustainability.

Furthermore, any operational plan developed will contribute to strengthening the sentinel surveillance systems in Sub-Saharan Africa in the preparedness and response to potential outbreaks.
