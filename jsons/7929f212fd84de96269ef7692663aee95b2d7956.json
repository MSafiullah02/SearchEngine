Ningbo is one of China's National Historic and Cultural Cities ( guojia lishi wenhua mingcheng ) designated by the State Council of China, and is widely regarded as one of the top 20 prosperous and competitive cities in China. Today, if you visit Ningbo as a tourist and you ask local people to name the \"must-go\" Places in downtown, Tianyi Square is always among the answers. Tianyi Square is undoubtedly the Number One landmark of Ningbo as a contemporary metropolis. Missing Tianyi Square in Ningbo for a tourist is just as unthinkable as missing Tiananmen in Beijing or the Bund in Shanghai. Moreover, Tianyi Square is too large and visible a place and too centrally located to be overlooked on any map of Ningbo.",

Its total area is 193,000 square meters, 1 almost half that of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. However, it hardly seems as vast and monumental as Tiananmen Square, because most parts of its space are used by retail stores that encircle a central square of 35,000 square meters, 2 which is a popular place for taking strolls, eating out, outdoor exhibition, and artistic performance. Indeed, Tianyi Square is the most popular public space in Ningbo. In ordinary days, it has a daily visitor volume of 60,000, and on weekends and holidays, its daily visitor volume may exceed 150,000. 3 Tianyi Square is located in the central part of the Haishu District ( haishu qu ), Ningbo's time-honored downtown for centuries. Tianyi Square is bound by East Sun Yat-sen Road ( Zhongshan dong lu ) on the north and Yaohang Street ( yaohang jie ) on the south, two main roads and business streets in Ningbo. East Sun Yat-sen Road is the most famous business street with a long history, and its particular section around the Dongmenkou area (formerly the location of the east gate, or the Dongdumen , of Ningbo's walled city, currently including northeastern portion of Tianyi Square) is long claimed to have the highest density of commercial establishments in eastern Zhejiang province, and thus the \"No. 1 street in eastern Zhejiang\" ( Zhedong diyi jie ).",

In a newspaper article, a local resident who had lived here for over 60 years prior to the Tianyi Square development project, recalled that before 1949 the residents here were mostly involved in handicrafts and other fairly regular jobs, except for a few rich families; on the streets, there were a variety of small shops in such traditional industries: ironware, wooden wagons, timber products, dyeing, painting, and wedding and funeral appliances, as well as some brothels; as early as 3:00-4:00 am, people would hear the sounds of forging pots and spatulas from ironware shops, coupled with street vendors' hawking dumplings in soup ( huntun ) and red bean porridge ( chidou zhou ); in brief, this area was bustling, but it was also disorderly and shabby. 5 It had deteriorated into the largest dilapidated neighborhood in Ningbo until the Tianyi Square project. Referred to as \" laoqiangmen \" (old walls and doors) by local people, it was full of old or even dangerous buildings dating back to the late Qing period at the earliest. 6 Before the Tianyi Square project, most residents of this area considered a fl ushing toilet a luxury and they still used night stools ( matong ). 7 In some cases, a dozen households had to share one water tap. 8 In a newspaper report, after being relocated elsewhere, a former household previously residing in Shamao Lane ( shamao xiang ) recalled their poor housing conditions in the Tianyi Square area, \"Our home was only 25 square meters, with no window at all, and ventilation and natural lighting was poor. So we had to turn lights on even in the daytime. During the plum rain ( meiyu ) season, the fl oor was very wet. There was no toilet in the old houses in this area.\" 9 Among the approximately 3700 residential households that were to be relocated, 10 only 30 households were living in suite-style houses ( chengtao fang ) that had private kitchens and toilets, and more than 700 households had average living space below the minimum standard of 11 square meters for Ningbo's urban residents at that time. 11 Some hazardous houses had to be held up by external wooden structures during typhoon seasons, and it was not uncommon that some houses collapsed during plum rain season. 12 There was a sharp contrast between the dilapidated houses in this area and its surrounding contemporary high-rise commercial buildings on East Sun Yat-sen Road and Yaohang Street. The two roads were widened during 1994-1997 as part of the \"Six Main Roads and One Flyover\" ( liu lu yi qiao ), a set of urban infrastructural improvement projects. Referred to as a \"village in city\" ( dushi xiangcun ) by the NBUCI, 13 the area before the Tianyi Square project was just like a basin, or potted landscape of precontemporary Ningbo.",

Yet, it can also be regarded as a \"backwardness advantage\" for Ningbo in that urban planning and redevelopment is always closely regulated by the government and disorderly and uncoordinated urban development by individual private developers have largely been prevented. 20 Thus, government-directed comprehensive urban redevelopment would be implemented in accordance with the requirements of industrial upgrading and long-range urban spatial restructuring.",

Its complexity and vastness brought it a few popular nicknames, such as the \"aircraft carrier of commerce\" ( shangye hangmu ). In fact, Tianyi Square had become the biggest one-stop ( yi zhan shi ) and landscaped ( yuanlin shi ) commercial complex in China consisting of shopping, leisure, and entertainment establishments upon its completion. 29 In an article stating his planning and design scheme, Ma Qingyun described Tianyi Square as Ningbo's \"mega-structure\" ( dushi ju gou ) that had adopted the grandness of Baron Haussmann's redevelopment scheme for modern Paris. His plan wiped off most old structures on the site except about 20 old trees and three historic buildings and relics. He interpreted the big central square within Tianyi Square as a symbolic landmark declaring the birth of a new urban core in Ningbo. The vastness of Tianyi Square, which was bigger than the total area of all the other commercial establishments in Ningbo prior to its construction, was legitimized in the sense that it was created as a meeting place not only for local consumption and commercial development, but was also outward oriented toward international capital and consumers. 30 Since Tianyi Square was regarded as a transitional CCD toward realization of a CBD afterward, and the cost of resident relocation and rehousing was already very high, the construction volume of the project was kept very low both in order to control investment scale and to leave room for further redevelopment. 31 Over a period of fi ve years, if the CCD was able to generate positive socio-economic outcomes and get recognition by Ningbo's people, it would be retained as a permanent project; otherwise, it would be demolished and then the land could be released for redevelopment once again. 32 The transitional and temporary nature of Tianyi Square is exactly the reason for its low building density: in the total area of 196,360 square meters, the total fl oor area is over 20,000 square meters, 33 and its fl oor area ratio is lower than 1.2; all buildings are only three-or four-storey high, 34 in which retail shops account for 90 %. 35 In addition, the property ownership of all the newly built shops has been retained by the NBUCI and leased to retailers. 36 No tenant is allowed to sublease his/her shop to other tenants. Rather, tenants are only allowed to terminate their leases with the NBUCI fi rst, and then the NBUCI gets back the shops and looks for new tenants. 37 In sum, the low building density, the land-use pattern primarily for retail industry, and the unitary property ownership and management system by the NBUCI, made Tianyi Square essentially different from an ordinary CBD that is usually full of high-density skyscrapers for offi ce use. These unique features in Tianyi Square guarantee easy land acquisition and demolition of buildings, as well as low cost of further redevelopment, if necessary.",

The CCD would consist of leisure, commercial, and cultural and entertainment establishments. The estimated total investment scale was 1.213 billion yuan , in which, prophase investment ( qianqi fei ) was 809,990,000 yuan (including relocation fees for residential and non-residential households), construction fee was 284.16 million yuan , and other fees (such as project design fee and management fee) were 119.84 million yuan . 38 The second step took place from late November in 2000 through mid-January in 2001, and it dealt with the feasibility study report ( kexingxing yanjiu baogao ) for the CCD project.

            "text": "The root cause of this phenomenon is China's unique land administration system. Land is an indispensable factor of production in any economic system; through constitutional amendments and the enactment and revisions of the Land Administration Law ( tudi guanli fa ), the Chinese government has been legislating for marketization of land step by step. On the one hand, China's land resources are still exclusively state and collective assets, and on the other hand, with the adoption of land-lease system, the right to use urban state land can also be purchased by individuals and organizations for commercial development. 40 The land to be redeveloped for Tianyi Square was urban state land, upon which the Ningbo government had actual administrative authority and full right to the disposal of land-lease revenues generated in its redevelopment. The project was undertaken by the NBUCI, which adopted market operation for this government designated project. The establishment of the NBUCI was authorized by the Ningbo Municipal Government, and was intended for investment in urban construction projects and operation of urban public physical assets, 41 especially such strategic projects that the private sector is not prepared to undertake, and government funds are unavailable or insuffi cient. 42 According to Mr. Zhou Riliang, then director of the Ningbo Urban Planning Bureau, the establishment of the NBUCI was actually specifically committed to undertaking the Tianyi Square project. 43 In December 1999, the Ningbo government transferred the assets of the \"Six Main Roads and One Flyover,\" the Ningbo Xingguang Town Gas Group Corporation ( Ningbo xingguang meiqi jituan gongsi ), and the Ningbo Urban Construction Development Corporation ( Ningbo chengshi jianshe fazhan zong gongsi ) to the NBUCI, and therefore, enabled the NBUCI to be a coherent corporate group with a registered capital of 500 million yuan . 44 By September 2009, the NBUCI had developed to be a giant corporate group with a total asset of 40 billion yuan and 13 subsidiaries. 45 The NBUCI has, since its establishment, been transforming Ningbo's mode of urban construction and the provision of municipal public utilities to be more market-oriented, and it has been able to overcome the shortage of government budget and seek diverse fi nancial sources on the capital market for public investment. For example, it succeeded in obtaining loans from the China Development Bank ( guojia kaifa yinhang ), an amount of 1.15 billion yuan, and thus reduced the lending burden of Ningbo's local commercial banks. And with the transfer of state legal person shares of the Ningbo Fuda Electric Appliance Co., Ltd. ( Ningbo fuda dianqi gufen youxiao gongsi ), a listed company, the NBUCI has been able to fi nance on the stock market. 46 As stated in the \"Feasibility Study Report on the Ningbo City Center Commercial Square Project,\" the Ningbo government authorized the NBUCI to undertake the Tianyi Square project, transferred the land-use right of this land to the NBUCI free of charge, which was estimated to be 1.2 billion yuan , 47 and exempted the NBUCI from any tax or fee pertaining to such a commercial real estate project. 48 Bai Xiaoyi, chairman of the board of the NBUCI, clarifi ed that the NBUCI still paid the land-lease fee to the Ningbo government, but the government then transferred the fee back to the NBUCI as the shareholder of the NBUCI. 49 There was a state-owned land-use right transfer contract ( guoyou tudi shiyongquan churang hetong ) between the Ningbo Municipal Land and Resources Bureau ( Ningbo shi guotu ziyuan ju ) and the NBUCI signed on December 26, 2002, regarding the Tianyi Square project, almost three months after the project was put into use. It was actually a revised version of the previous contract signed in 2001, indicating that the land-lease fee per square meter was 2973.00 yuan , and the total was 484,798,785.60 yuan , which had been paid by the NBUCI before the contract was signed. 50 By mortgaging this land to the Agricultural Bank of China Ningbo Branch ( Zhongguo nongye yinhang Ningbo shi fenhang ), and guaranteed by government credit, the NBUCI managed to obtain a loan of over 800 million yuan for resident relocation, 51 and later on another loan of near 600 million yuan for construction works. 52 The NBUCI also raised another amount of 200 million yuan on its own for the project. 53 In addition, assisted with the liaison by the Ningbo government, the NBUCI signed a long-term collaborative agreement with the Ningbo Commercial Bank ( Ningbo shi shangye yinhang , reorganized as a listed company and renamed Bank of Ningbo [ Ningbo yinhang ] in 2007) in 2001 as well, according to which, the Ningbo Commercial Bank would help in fi nancing urban redevelopment, infrastructural construction, and environment protection projects undertaken by the NBUCI. He Jianmin, deputy mayor of Ningbo, specifi cally in charge of urban construction at that time, attended this agreement signing ceremony, and represented the Ningbo government as an indispensable middleman between the two local state enterprises. 54 It was decided that the property ownership of Tianyi Square would be retained by the NBUCI, and all shops would be leased to retailers to generate rental income, which was to be used by the NBUCI to repay bank loans. 55 This arrangement was one of the preconditions for a possible redevelopment once again later on. In order to undertake both initial investment attraction and long-term business management, the NBUCI established a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ningbo City Square Development & Management Co., Ltd. ( Ningbo chengshi guangchang kaifa jingying youxian gongsi , NBCSDM), to take charge of long-term management of Tianyi Square. 56 Some external partners were also invited to join the management of Tianyi Square. For example, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung ( dai de liang hang ), a global leading agent of real estate consultancy, was involved in business planning and investment attraction for Tianyi Square until 2004. 57 A manager in the Investment Offi ce ( zhaoshang chu ) of the NBCSDM explained that At that time [when Tianyi Square was being developed], commercial real estate project was still a new thing in Ningbo, and we were in the process of learning about it. So we invited DTZ Debenham Tie Leung. However, investment attraction is a localized undertaking, and DTZ Debenham Tie Leung was not very familiar with Ningbo in some respects, so it retreated in 2004, and our company has since then been doing it on our own. 58",

According to economist Sheng Hong, such local state enterprises committed to urban construction investment have existed for years in China. In the context that the Budget Law ( yusuan fa ) prohibited China's local governments from borrowing from banks or issuing bonds for a long time, these local state enterprises have enabled local governments to fi nd fi nance on the capital market. 63 Thus, as stated by Bai Xiaoyi, 64 the NBUCI can be regarded as a hybrid authority performing the dual functions of local governance and entrepreneurial undertakings. Even Bai Xiaoyi's job was illustrative of this duality: as chairman of the board of the NBUCI, he is both a government offi cial and a state entrepreneur. 65 The \"city operator\" model refl ects a general trend prevailing in China since the early 1990s, a trend that is widely believed to originate in the city of Dalian under its mayor and later party secretary, Bo Xilai. 66 The Chinese reference to such a trend is \"managing the city\" ( jingying chengshi ). Dalian, the biggest seaport in Northeast China, used to be a city famous for its heavy industry, a common economic feature across China, especially in Northeast China, under the command economy. Bo Xilai had been the principal politician in Dalian since he was appointed acting major of Dalian in 1992, and until he got promoted to head the Liaoning Provincial Government in 2000.",

He proposed two methods of managing cities: (1) creating quality urban environment, including infrastructure and landscape, (2) attracting inward investment. The success of managing the city relies on high quality of urban planning, for which, he put forward the guideline of \"Don't pursue the biggest, but the fi nest\" ( bu qiu zui da , dan qiu zui hao ) for Dalian. 67 A large amount of land-lease fee was regarded as the second source of fi scal revenue for the Dalian government. 68 The fee was used by the Dalian government to improve urban environment, such as relocation of pollutant factories to industrial outskirts, slum clearance and housing improvement, and urban landscaping, and further inward investment attraction, and thus, a virtuous circle. 69 Under Bo's leadership, especially guided by his notion of \"managing the city,\" which was fi rst proposed by him in 1993, 70 Dalian announced its ambition of becoming \"Hong Kong in the north\" ( beifang Xianggang ) in 1993, namely a hub of trade, fi nance, and export processing in Northeast Asia, 71 and obtained a number of national and international titles in recognition of its gorgeous and livable urban environment: Nationally Designated Garden City ( guoji yuanlin chengshi ), National Model City for Environmental Protection ( guojia huanbao mofan chengshi ), and the UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour Award ( Lianheguo renju jiang ). These achievements were essentially the outcomes of Bo's notion of \"managing the city\" as state assets. 72 Bo's notion of managing the city invoked a large amount of research, which more or less has achieved such consensus that the city can be packaged and marketed, and managing the city by the government is a businesslike undertaking. 73 The notion \"managing the city\" was highly infl uential during the 1990s and impacted the establishment of the NBUCI and its operation of the Tianyi Square project.",

            "text": "The relocation task was also politically signifi cant in that it was the bad housing and infrastructural conditions of this area that made the Ningbo government launch this challenging project in the fi rst place. In fact, upon its launch, the Tianyi Square project had become the largest urban redevelopment project in the history of Ningbo, 82 as well as in Zhejiang province, 83 in terms of demolition volume. On December 7, 2000, the Offi ce for Key Urban Construction Projects of Ningbo ( Ningbo shi chengshi jianshe zhongda xiangmu bangongshi) signed a contract with the Ningbo Municipal Offi ce of Demolition, Relocation and Rehousing ( Ningbo shi fangwu chaiqian bangongshi ) to implement demolition. As stated in this contract, the total fl oor area to be demolished was 130,673 square meters, in which, the total fl oor area of 2120 residential buildings was 89,745.3 square meters, and the total fl oor area of 125 non-residential buildings was 40,928 square meters. The total compensation fee for demolished properties was estimated to be 360,624,700 yuan . In addition, the Offi ce for Key Urban Construction Projects of Ningbo needed to pay management and service fee to the Ningbo Municipal Offi ce of Demolition, Relocation and Rehousing for demolition affairs in the amount of 3,005,400 yuan . 84 The demolition permit ( chaiqian xuke zheng ) was issued in November 2000. 85 Starting on December 1, 2000, 3750 residential households and 340 work units and other organizations in this area began to sign relocation agreements with the NBUCI, and on March 12, 2001 , electric and water supplies were to be cut off, and the demolition was to start. There were two rehousing options: rehousing in resident-decided locations ( zixuan anzhi ) and rehousing in government-designated locations ( zhijie anzhi ). The former meant that households could choose monetary compensation in the form of a housing coupon ( fang piao ), 86 and buy or rent apartments elsewhere on their own, and the latter meant households could choose to buy or rent apartments provided by the Ningbo government at subsidized prices as in-kind compensation, which, in this particular case, was Nanyuan Estate ( nanyuan xiaoqu ) in Haishu District, 87 about four kilometers south of Tianyi Square. It was reported in February 28, 2001 , that the rehousing in resident-decided locations method was preferred among relocated households, with an overwhelming ratio of 99 %. 88 The relocation and demolition arrangement was harsh to guarantee that the Tianyi Square project could be launched on time. In a magazine article it was disclosed by an insider in the NBUCI that each demolition agreement between the demolisher and relocated residents was settled within 14 days; if any household refused the compensation standard and demolition timeline set by the Ningbo government, a notifi cation of forced eviction ( qiangzhi chaiqian ) would be issued to the residents a few days later, and the household's property was subject to the legitimate violence of the local state apparatus. 89 The Tianyi Square project was the second large-scale urban redevelopment project in Ningbo that adopted the policy of rehousing in residentdecided locations, just after the redevelopment of the Moon Lake ( yue hu ) scenic area in 1998. This policy was said to be the most feasible way to pay monetary housing subsidy ( zhufang huobihua butie ) to an urban population, in order to gradually supersede the former housing allocation ( zhufang fenpei ) system. 90 As housing reform was launched in 1998 across China, in-kind housing allocation had been terminated in Ningbo by the end of 1998, and monetization of housing subsidy had been implemented since early 1999. 91 Through monetary compensation and rehousing estates provided by the Ningbo government, the Tianyi Square project materialized and paid a considerable amount of the high market value of the land occupied by the shabby neighborhood. To many relocated households whose income level was low, the monetary compensation was indeed very helpful to improve their housing conditions. It would be very diffi cult, if not impossible, for them to fl ee from the shabby neighborhoods and get better apartments elsewhere without such a government project.",

The God of Herbal Medicine Hall thus lost its original signifi cance as a worshipping hall and a chamber of commerce. Since 1953, the God of Herbal Medicine Hall had been used as a warehouse by the predecessor of the currently Ningbo Dahongying Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ( Ningbo dahongying yaoye gufen youxian gongsi , DHY Pharm). It was no longer a public space, and could be said to have disappeared in a cloud of over-crowded and shabby neighborhoods for a long time, even though it was designated as a municipallevel architectural heritage point ( shi ji wenbao dian ) in 1992. 106 The key fi gures that contributed to the in-situ conservation of the God of Herbal Medicine Hall were Yang Gucheng and Wang Jietang, who were also the authors of the article in the Ningbo Daily on May 31, 2001. Known as the \"crazy man for heritage conservation\" ( wenbao kuangren ), Yang Gucheng is a famous local activist who has been committed to heritage conservation in Ningbo for years, and was one of the \"Top 10 Activists for Cultural Heritage Conservation in Ningbo\" ( Ningbo shi shi jia wenhua yichan baohuzhe ) 107 ; he also won the \"Heritage Conservation Contributor of the Year 2008\" ( 2008 nian wenbao niandu gongxian jiang ) in China. 108 Yang Gucheng, along with Wang Jietang and some other heritage conservation activists, argued that the most valuable part of the God of Herbal Medicine Hall was its brick carving, which would defi nitely be damaged in the process of relocation and rebuilding; moreover, the whole history of the Yaohang Street area as a hub of herbal medicine trade would be wiped out if ex-situ reconstruction was carried out. On April 9, 2001 109 The case thus became known across China due to the coverage in the center-level offi cial newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Yang's letter was then forwarded by He Jianmin to the NBUCI for a reconsideration of the design scheme of Tianyi Square. The response of He Jianmin came to Yang Gucheng 10 days later, with the promise that their appeal for conservation had been accepted by the Ningbo government, and the NBUCI would be responsible for revising the design scheme to accommodate the in-situ conservation of the God of Herbal Medicine Hall. 110 The NBUCI invited a number of time-honored pharmaceutical fi rms, including Beijing Tongrentang and Hangzhou Huqingyutang, to take part in the bidding for renovation and operation scheme of the God of Herbal Medicine Hall. 111 The Hall was to be reused as a pharmacy and a museum of herbal medicine history, and the tenant would still be the Ningbo DHY Pharm. 112 On April 29, 2002 , the renovation plan of the rear hall as the Ningbo Herbal Medicine History Exhibition Hall ( Ningbo yaoye lishi chenlie guan ) got the fi nal approval. 113 It would become Ningbo's fourth museum of a particular industry, following the Ningbo Numismatic Museum ( Ningbo qianbi bowuguan ), the Ningbo Museum of Costume ( Ningbo fuzhuang bowuguan ), and the Ningbo Museum of Agricultural Machinery ( Ningbo nongji bowuguan ). 114 The Ningbo DHY Pharm was in charge of renovating and operating the God of Herbal Medicine Hall as its tenant. In the rental agreement signed between the NBUCI and the Ningbo DHY Pharm, the God of Herbal Medicine Hall would always used for pharmaceutical business, and its original architectural style would never be changed or damaged. 115 Thus, the God of Herbal Medicine Hall succeeded in maintaining both its physical existence and its pharmaceutical function in Tianyi Square, thanks to the successful appeal of architectural conservation activists.",

Ningbo has a historically established garment industry. Thus, in order to create a specialized street for clothes retailing ( fuzhuang yitiao jie ) in Tianyi Square, the Ningbo government convened a forum to consult Ningbo's major garment fi rms, including such nation-wide brand-name manufacturers as Firs ( shanshan ), Younger ( yage ' er ), Romon ( luomeng ), Rouse ( luozi ), and Peacebird ( taiping nia o). 130 When the Ningbo government was holding high-profi le promotional campaigns, the NBUCI thoroughly studied the investment potential. Initially, the NBUCI just focused on Ningbo's local fi rms, but soon it found that the size of Ningbo's qualifi ed investors was still limited. Therefore, the NBUCI began to proactively promote Tianyi Square outside of Ningbo, mainly focusing on enterprises based in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wenzhou; the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway ( Hu Hang Yong gaosu gonglu ) became the major transportation corridor for the investments team of the NBUCI. They turned to the chambers of commerce in those cities for recommendation of qualifi ed investors, and they also directly approached the businesses that they were interested in. 131 In brief, inward investment attraction was signifi cantly facilitated by the Ningbo government's promotion, and was mainly undertaken by the professional team of the NBCSDM. As reported by the NBCSDM on December 18, 2001, 120 fi rms had signed rental agreements with the NBCSDM since December 2000, at three fi rms a day on average, and there had been another 800 fi rms which had shown rental intentions. 132 As discussed earlier, the implications of Tianyi Square go far beyond simply a shopping mall, not only because it is essentially a government project, but also because of its central location and complex functions as a new urban core. Its grand opening in 2002 during the PRC's National Day holiday, therefore, was also deeply characterized by high-profi le government involvement and a high level of local media coverage.",

To some store owners, besides the nation-wide Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003, the diffi culties were due to unsatisfactory business management of Tianyi Square by the NBCSDM, high rent for shop space, and that Ningbo people had not been accustomed to the new consumption pattern in Tianyi Square as an outdoor shopping mall. 135 Some tenants were even unwilling to pay rent to the NBCSDM in time, because poor business performance in Tianyi Square had let them down. 136 In short, Tianyi Square has not always been a success since its opening simply because of its central location.",

            "text": "After 2003, however, Tianyi Square became really prosperous and the most popular one-stop shopping mall among Ningbo people. It consists of ten functional zones: men's clothes, women's clothes, children's products, digital products, restaurants, supermarket, department stores, luxuries, hotels, and entertainment. This high diversity makes Tianyi Square attractive to people of almost all ages and consumption capacity. As business is booming, tenants are no longer reluctant to pay rent to the NBCSDM as they were in the fi rst year of Tianyi Square's operation. 137 The governance structure of Tianyi Square since its opening has been established through partnerships between the NBUCI, the Haishu District Government, and business tenants. In an article in the Ningbo Daily reporting on the property management of Tianyi Square, the author intentionally used the often negative phrase \"no separation of enterprise from government\" ( zheng qi bu fen ) to describe the governance structure of \"management by enterprise as the main body, and law enforcement by the government as the guarantor\" ( qiye guanli wei zhuti , zhengfu zhifa wei baozhang ) that incorporates urban management ( chengshi guanli ) function and property management function. 138 The NBCSDM is in charge of property management. The Tianyi Square Management Committee ( tianyi guangchang guanli weiyuanhui ) is the governing authority, which consists of representatives of the Haishu District Government, the NBUCI, and business tenants. The Committee sets up a Comprehensive Management Offi ce ( zonghe guanli bangongshi ) to perform the functions of such governmental departments as Urban Management Bureau ( chengguan ju ), Administration for Industry and Commerce ( gongshang guanli ju ), Traffi c Police Detachment ( jiaojing zhidui ), and Fire Brigade ( xiaofang zhidui ), to specifi cally deal with administrative examinations and approvals ( xingzheng shenpi ) for business in Tianyi Square. 139 The unitary property ownership of Tianyi Square held by the NBUCI enables the NBCSDM to formulate long-range business plans and management for Tianyi Square. As explained by the director of the general offi ce of the NBCSDM, there would be no way for the NBCSDM to manage Tianyi Square in a coherent way if the properties were sold out to individual proprietors, because proprietors usually don't respect a mere property management company. A manager in the Investment Offi ce of the NBCSDM added that if the properties were sold, since shop owners are eager to attract tenants, chaotic industrial composition and lowering quality of property management would be unavoidable. 140 Holding property ownership does not bring quick returns to the NBCSDM, but it makes Tianyi Square economically sustainable in the long run as long as it is properly managed. The NBCSDM not only collects rent from its business tenants, which accounts for about 70 % of its total revenue, but also makes money from parking and advertising fees in Tianyi Square, as well as venue rental income from activity organizers who use Tianyi Square to hold commercial activities. 141 It was estimated in 2008 that there were four public activities held in Tianyi Square every day. 142 Unitary property ownership also enables the NBCSDM to reorganize functional zones and merchandise structure of Tianyi Square regularly to adapt to the changing market environment and demands. Crystal Street ( shuijing jie ), which used to be full of low-end gift shops, was later on transformed into a specialized street of high-end jewelry. Since mid-2007, there had been a new round of restructuring of overall retail zoning and upgrading of landscape in Tianyi Square over a period of three to fi ve years. 143 The tenants in the catering industry zone signed leases with the NBCSDM in 2002; when I was doing my fi eldwork in July 2010, the NBCSDM was renewing leases with tenants in this zone, and sought to introduce some new tenants to replace some old tenants, in order to upgrade the overall service standard in this zone. 144 A more interesting case of merchandise reorganization is the God of Herbal Medicine Hall. Once the lease between the NBCSDM and the DHY Pharm expired, the main hall of the God of Herbal Medicine Hall has been leased to Qingyuan Teahouse ( qingyuan chaguan ), and its annexes were leased to some arts and craft stores selling jade handicraft (see Fig. 2.1 ) . A manager in the Investment Offi ce of the NBCSDM told me that those tenants were selected by the NBCSDM because their businesses are somehow in harmony with the God of Herbal Medicine Hall's Chinese traditional architecture. 145 In addition, the NBCSDM operates its own department stores in Tianyi Square as sustainable cash cows: Gugo Shopping Mall and International Shopping Center. The two stores, alongside other large stores like Intime Department Store, are regarded as \"fl agship stores\" in Tianyi Square. 146 The NBCSDM is also involved in organizing some symposia to review and refl ect on its management strategies from time to time, during which, experts from out of town are invited for consultation. For example, in July 2008, as part of the Ningbo Shopping Festival, a symposium on upgrading commercial establishments of Tianyi Square was jointly organized by the Haishu District Bureau of Foreign Trade & Economic Cooperation ( Haishu qu duiwai maoyi jingji hezuo ju ) and the NBCSDM. Managers of commercial real estate projects and business districts in Beijing and Shanghai were invited and consulted at the symposium regarding the upgrading of Tianyi Square. 147",

            "text": "Tianyi Square has overcome the diffi culties at its initial stage of operation, and has soon gained fame as one of the most popular and accessible commercial centers and public open spaces in Ningbo. In addition to enjoying the scenery and shopping facilities of Tianyi Square, Ningbo citizens and visitors can also be entertained by various commercial promotions and performances held in Tianyi Square from time to time. Tianyi Square has received wide acknowledgement and acclaim from Ningbo and beyond. For example, Tianyi Square was awarded the \"China Architectural Arts Award\" ( Zhongguo jianzhu yishu jiang ) and was listed in the \"Top 10 Featured Business Street in Zhejiang\" ( Zhejiang sheng shi da shangye tese jie ) in 2004, and the opening of Tianyi Square was awarded \"Top 10 Most Infl uential News in Ningbo in the Past 20 Years\" ( Ningbo 20 nian zui ju yingxiangli de shi da xinwen ). 148 In an interview in March 2004, Zhou Hongming, then general manager of the NBUCI, disclosed that about 85-90 % of the shops in Tianyi Square had been leased, and the overall market value of Tianyi Square had gone up to four billion yuan . Besides, a professional business management team had been trained in the process of business management of Tianyi Square, and they were going to operate the NBUCI's next project: the Laowaitan . 149 Actually, Tianyi Square's business operation by the NBUCI started making a profi t just one year after its opening in 2002. 150 As Tianyi Square became so successful, the NBCSDM became quite confi dent in its business management capability. A manager in the Investment Offi ce of the NBCSDM said that there is little need for the NBCSDM to organize promotions for Tianyi Square anymore, because Tianyi Square has already established its reputation, and the Ningbo government is very supportive to the NBCSDM. So the NBCSDM was only promoting their new projects. 151 In the meantime, there has been a series of strategic urban spatial restructuring in Ningbo since the Tianyi Square project, according to which, Ningbo's overall urban spatial layout, including the location of Ningbo's CBD, has been signifi cantly changed. In September 2004, the master plan of an \"Eastern New Zone\" ( dongbu xincheng ) and the detailed urban design of its core district were released. 152 This scheme was approved by the Ningbo Municipal Government in December 2004. 153 This is a signifi cant strategy for expanding Ningbo's city proper and creating a multi-core spatial layout in Ningbo under the slogan of \"Step Out of the Confl uence of Three Rivers, Build a Greater Ningbo\" ( tiaochu Sanjiangkou , jianshe da Ningbo ). 154 Eastern New Zone would be Ningbo's second city center located in the previously manufacturing outskirts of the East Bank District ( Jiangdong qu ) and Yinzhou District ( Yinzhou qu ), just on the axis of the eastward extended Sun Yat-sen Road across the Fenghua River. Eastern New Zone will consist of administrative, business, information and technological functional zones. It will occupy a total area of 15.85 square kilometers, in which an area of 8.45 square kilometers will be reserved for the core zone as Ningbo's administrative, international trade, shipping service, and fi nancial centers in the near future. Since January 2005, construction works of Eastern New Zone have been steadily undertaken. 155 Since January 2014, the Ningbo Municipal Government, the Ningbo Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Ningbo Municipal People's Congress, and the Ningbo Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as some departments of the government and the party, have been relocating to the Eastern New Zone, making that area Ningbo's new administrative center.",

            "text": "In 2002, the former subsidiary County of Yin was annexed by Ningbo Municipality and renamed Yinzhou District, which added 1380 square kilometers of land and a population of 730,000 to the Ningbo Municipality. 156 The Yinzhou District Government has been formally building its Yinzhou New Zone ( Yinzhou xinchengqu ) since 2003 with a total area of 33 square kilometers as the new administrative and business center of the Yinzhou District. In Yinzhou New Zone, a \"Southern CBD\" ( nanbu shangwuqu ) was launched in 2005, which will occupy a total area of 530,000 square meters upon its fi nal completion. 157 Since the Ningbo Municipality has signifi cantly expanded its territory by annexation, and has been building large-scale new urban cores, including two new CBDs, beyond its traditional downtown where Tianyi Square is located, the location of Tianyi Square is no longer the only ideal location for Ningbo's CBD. Besides, Tianyi Square has proven to be a great success as a retail and public space, and has gained fame as Ningbo's \"living room\" ( keting ). 158 Therefore, there is no need for the Ningbo government to consider any further plan to redevelop Tianyi Square signifi cantly toward a CBD anymore as previously planned. In short, Tianyi Square has secured itself as a permanent project. 4 CONCLUDING REMARKS Today, Tianyi Square has been widely acknowledged as a big success. It is still the largest and most infl uential mega project of urban redevelopment in downtown Ningbo. All those transformations are the outcomes of the local state-led urban redevelopment regime, in which the NBUCI are referred to as a \"city manager\" or \"city operator.\" In addition, the Ningbo government never refrained from organizing high-profi le promotional campaigns for Tianyi Square. The post-development governance structure of Tianyi Square has been most remarkably characterized by the partnerships between the NBUCI, the Haishu District Government, and business tenants. While the NBUCI is still a critical player in the management of Tianyi Square as its property owner, the local district-level government departments are in charge of administrative affairs. Infl uential business tenants are also involved in the management of Tianyi Square through the Tianyi Square Management Committee.",

The Tianyi Square redevelopment project acted as a prelude to the Laowaitan project, which was the second strategic urban redevelopment project undertaken by the NBUCI. Despite its smaller scale in comparison with Tianyi Square, the Laowaitan project contained more interesting and complicated stories, mainly because it had more heritage buildings; in addition there was NBUCI's correspondingly higher-level commitment to heritage conservation, its more symbolized re-interpretation of history and heritage, discourse-building and place-making, as well as its essentially different post-development governance mechanism, in which a unitary governing body was at fi rst non-existent, and later on was being established by the local state, albeit with much weaker governance capacity, and had to deal with atomized individual proprietors. These stories will be discussed in the following chapters.",
