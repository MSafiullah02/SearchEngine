Therefore, the studies for the stochastic epidemic models have more practical significance. In recent years, the stochastic epidemic models with the quarantine and isolation have been investigated in articles [[29], [30], [31], [32]]. Particularly, in [29] Zhang et al. investigated the dynamics of the deterministic and stochastic SIQS epidemic model with an isolation and nonlinear incidence. The sufficient conditions on the extinction almost surely of the disease and the existence of stationary distribution of the model are established. Zhang et al. in [30] discussed the threshold of a stochastic SIQS epidemic model. The criteria on the extinction and permanence in the mean of global positive solutions with probability one are established. Besides, we also see that the stochastic persistence and the existence of stationary distribution for the various stochastic epidemic models and population models have been widely investigated. Some important recent works can been found in [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]] and the references cited therein.",

It is easy to see that limk\u2192\u221einf(S,I,Q)\u2208R+3\u2216UkH(S,I,Q)=\u221e,where Uk=(1k,k)\u00d7(1k,k)\u00d7(1k,k) with integer k>1. At the same time, H(S,I,Q) is a continuous function. Hence, H(S,I,Q) has a minimum value H(S0,I0,Q0) in the interior of R+3. Then, we define a nonnegative C2-function V in the following form V(S,I,Q)=H(S,I,Q)\u2212H(S0,I0,Q0)By the Ito\u2019s formula, for any solution (S(t),I(t),Q(t)) of model (1.2) we have L(\u2212lnS)=\u2212AS+\u03b2I+\u03bc1\u2212\u03b3IS\u2212\u03beQS+12\u03c352,\nL(\u2212lnQ)=\u2212\u03b4IQ+\u03bc1+\u03be+\u03b13+12\u03c332,\nLV1=\u2212c1AS+c1\u03b2I+c1\u03bc1\u2212c1\u03b3IS\u2212c1\u03beQS+c112\u03c352\u2212c2\u03b2S+c2(\u03bc1+\u03b3+\u03b4+\u03b12)+c212\u03c322\u2264\u22122[(Ac1c2\u03b2)12\u2212A]+c1\u03b2I\u2212c1\u03b3IS\u2212c1\u03beQS=\u22122A[(R\u00af0)12\u22121]+c1\u03b2I\u2212c1\u03b3IS\u2212c1\u03beQSand LV2=(S+I+Q)\u03b8[A\u2212\u03bc1(S+I+Q)\u2212\u03b12I\u2212\u03b13Q]+\u03b82(S+I+Q)\u03b8\u22121(\u03c322I2+\u03c332Q2+\u03c352S2)\u2264A(S+I+Q)\u03b8\u2212(\u03bc1\u2212\u03b82(\u03c322\u2228\u03c332\u2228\u03c352))(S+I+Q)\u03b8+1\u2264\u2212\u03bc\u2217(S\u03b8+1+I\u03b8+1+Q\u03b8+1)+C,where \u03bc\u2217=12(\u03bc1\u2212\u03b82(\u03c322\u2228\u03c332\u2228\u03c352))>0 and C=sup(S,I,Q)\u2208R+3{A(S+I+Q)\u03b8\u2212\u03bc\u2217(S+I+Q)\u03b8+1}<\u221e.Therefore, the differential operator L acting on the V yields LV\u2264\u22122AM\u03b7+c1M\u03b2I\u2212c1M\u03b3IS\u2212c1M\u03beQS\u2212\u03bc\u2217(S\u03b8+1+I\u03b8+1+Q\u03b8+1)+C\u2212AS+\u03b2I+\u03bc1\u2212\u03b3IS\u2212\u03beQS\u2212\u03b4IQ+\u03bc1+\u03be+\u03b13+12\u03c332+12\u03c352\u2264\u22122AM\u03b7+C+2\u03bc1+\u03be+\u03b13+12\u03c332+12\u03c352\u2212\u03bc\u2217(S\u03b8+1+I\u03b8+1+Q\u03b8+1)\u2212AS\u2212\u03b4IQ+(c1M\u03b2+\u03b2)I,where \u03b7=(R\u00af0)12\u22121.Now, we construct a compact subset D such that the condition (ii) in Lemma 4.1 holds.

In fact, the diffusion matrix associated to model (1.2) is A(x)=(aij(x))3\u00d73=\u03c352S2000\u03c322I2000\u03c332Q2,where x=(S,I,Q). It is easily proved that by Remark 4.1 condition (i) in Lemma 4.1 hold. Thus, we finally obtain that model (1.2) has a unique stationary distribution and is ergodic. This completes the proof.  \u25a1\n",
