Guideline-based empiric antimicrobial therapy is recommended for the treatment of CAP by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA).[2] Few studies examined different aspects of CAP in Saudi Arabia.[3456] Limited data regarding the adherence to ATS/IDSA guidelines are available from this part of the world. One study included patients from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar[7] and one study from Oman only[8] evaluated the adherence to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) CAP guidelines.[4] In this study, we evaluate the rate of CAP patients who received the recommended antibiotics based on local and international guidelines.[24] In addition, we evaluate the trend over time of the use different antibiotics and the use of combination therapy.",

The hospital is a 350-bed general hospital and provides medical care for 160,000 individuals eligible for medical care.[9] The patients' data were retrieved from the health information unit using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The electronic pharmacy database was then used to retrieve the prescribed antibiotics and the duration of therapy for each antibiotic. A standard Microsoft Excel sheet was used to record the retrieved data. Statistical analysis was done using Minitab\u00ae(Minitab Inc. Version 17, State College, Pennsylvania, USA; 2017). The generated data included the mean duration of each antibiotic standard deviation (\u00b1SD). A significant P value was considered if P < 0.05. The study was approved by the JHAH Institutional Review Board. The diagnosis of CAP was based on the presence of a group of clinical features such as fever and the demonstration of an infiltrate by chest radiograph with or without supporting microbiological data as suggested by the ATS/IDSA.[2] We also calculated the CURB-65 score based on Confusion, Blood Urea, Respiratory Rate, Blood pressure, and age \u226565 years.",

Two previous smaller studies addressed this issue and one of them was a multicenter.[78] The current study showed that combination therapy of levofloxacin and imipenem-cilastatin was prescribed for 21.8% of non-ICU patients compared to 60.6% of ICU patients and that imipenem-cilastatin was prescribed for 31.8% of non-ICU patients compared to 56.8% of ICU patients. The overall empiric antibiotic use in CAP in the current study was in alignment with those of the ATS/IDSA.[2] Various studies showed that the overall guideline adherence rate for empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP was 31.2%\u201348%.[101112] The compliance rate of empiric antibiotic use in CAP was very low (6.4%) in one study from Europe in 2006[13] and was 66% in a study from South Africa.[14] Adherence to CAP guidelines was associated with better prognosis in the short term, especially in patients requiring mechanical ventilation.[15] The rate of initial ICU admission of CAP patients was low (2.8%) in the present study. This rate is comparable to the rate from Hong Kong (4%) and lower than rates from Spain (17%) and United Kingdom (8.7%).[1617] However, rates of ICU admission and criteria leading to such admissions may be different among multiple healthcare systems.[18] One study showed that the most common antibiotics used were levofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and clarithromycin.[13] In a study from China, levofloxacin was the most common initial antibiotic (15.7%).[19] In one study, non-ICU patients received a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone 33% of the time or beta-lactam plus macrolide (19%).[20] In an Australian study, ceftriaxone and azithromycin combination was used for 56% of the patients[21] and one-third of patients with CAP in an Indian study received macrolide and a beta-lactam.[22]",

            "text": "In the current study, imipenem-cilastatin was prescribed for about one-third of non-ICU patients and for over half of ICU patients (P = 0.0009). The data suggest that there is room to improve empiric antibiotic usage in non-ICU settings. In an Australian study, many mild CAP patients were treated as a severe CAP with an odds ratio of 8 for mild CAP versus severe CAP.[21] Moreover, in an audit from Britain, initial antibiotics matched local CAP guidelines in only 55.5% of patients.[23] In addition, in one study from the GCC countries, 20.3% of 684 patients were treated with two agents and levofloxacin was the most frequently used (65.7%), followed by ceftriaxone (16.1%) and moxifloxacin (13.1%).[7] Thus, despite the existence of guidelines, the optimal use of antibiotics had not been achieved in CAP. Prospective audit and feedback for the use of antibiotics are still a priority to improve antibiotic stewardship.",

Previous studies from Saudi Arabia did not address the rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to quinolone[2526] or showed a very low resistance rate.[27] Thus, further studies are needed to examine the change in S. pneumoniae resistance to quinolones in this part of the world. Antibiotic duration and adherence to CAP guidelines are important elements in antibiotic stewardship.[28] According to the IDSA guidelines, a minimum of 5 days is needed to treat patients with CAP.[2] The mean duration of therapy of each antibiotic was 2.8\u20134.4 days, with mean antibiotic days of 7 \u00b1 5 days.",
