The pathogenicity to cause disease is dependent on the pathogen's infectivity, and its ability to be transported and to survive (Anderson and Bokor, 2012, Kersh et al., 2013, La Scola and Raoult, 2001, Rousset et al., 2009). After being emitted or aerosolised from its source, dispersion to the surrounding environment (nearby residents, livestock, etc.) may occur. However, large-scale measurements are not generally available, time-consuming and expensive, thus complicating pathogen quantification. Also, pathogens may be inactivated in the air as well (e.g., by temperature or humidity), (Despr\u00e9s et al., 2012, Griffiths and DeCosemo G.A.L., 1994, Verreault et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Five major processes are related to the number of infections caused by airborne pathogens:\n(1)The amount of pathogen released per unit of time (emission rate), being a function of pathogen availability and the aerosolisation rate (Shao, 2008, Viana et al., 2008; see Section 2.2).(2)Meteorological effects, such as wind speed, wind direction, turbulence, and deposition (Stull, 2000). Mechanical turbulence is generated by wind speed variation in height; convective turbulence is related to the stability of the atmosphere. A mix of different wind conditions and solar radiation results into three basic states of the atmosphere \u2013 unstable, stable, and neutral \u2013 that largely influence the surface layer concentrations (Jacob, 1999). Unstable atmosphere are characterised by vertical (buoyant) motions induced by thermal convection that lifts particles up to higher altitudes, thus leading to decreased surface concentrations. A stable atmosphere leads to higher surface concentrations as low wind speeds and limited solar radiation limit vertical mixing. Neutral atmospheres are characterised by mainly horizontal (advective) turbulent motions with moderate vertical mixing and high horizontal plume extent.Deposition is subdivided in wet deposition (the removal of particles by cloud and rain droplets) and dry deposition (the dust flux from the atmosphere to the surface through molecular and turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling) (Flossmann et al., 1985; Petroff et al., 2008; Shao, 2008). The dry deposition rate is a function of particle size: very large particles (\u00b170 \u00b5m) deposit about 10,000 times faster than ultrafine (\u22640.1 \u00b5m) particles (Lin et al., 1994). The particle size distribution \u2013 the relative amount of particles as a function of mass or number \u2013 is therefore an important predictor for the distance covered (Blatny et al., 2011).(3)Inactivation (Griffin, 2007), expressed as a function of time or meteorological conditions, such as temperature and humidity (Zhao et al., 2014; see Section 2.5). Large differences in inactivation rates are observed among bioaerosols (Zhao et al., 2014; see Section 5.2): viruses and vegetative bacteria may be inactivated within minutes to hours or days, while spores are generally highly persistent (Dungan, 2010, Griffiths and DeCosemo G.A.L., 1994, Jones and Harrison, 2004, Stuart and Wilkening, 2005). Note that growth of microorganisms can also occur (Harrison et al., 2005).(4)The amount of pathogens inhaled, with breathing rate, lung volume, and particle size being important factors (Despr\u00e9s et al., 2012, Rostami, 2009, Wilkinson et al., 2012; see Section 3). With respect to particle size, the inhalable (\u2264100 \u00b5m: particles breathed in), thoracic (\u226410 \u00b5m: particles entering the lung's airways), and respirable fraction (<5 \u00b5m: particles penetrating the terminal bronchioles) are distinguished (Millner, 2009).(5)The host's health response as a function of inhaled dose (Teunis and Havelaar, 2000; see Section 3).\n",

Their general spatial resolution is in the order of several kilometres to thousands of kilometres. A particular form of Eulerian and Lagrangian models are those based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that numerically solve the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. CFD-models are very useful in complex terrains, such as mountains or urban environments, where the spatial scales of interest are close to the scales of landscape features.

Donaldson et al. (1982) applied a Gaussian model and concluded that criteria for a successful long-range transmission \u2013 favourable wind speed, wind direction, stable atmosphere, and high emission rates \u2013 were fulfilled. However, if there was indeed an airborne link between the farms in France and the UK, then more outbreaks in France might have been expected, yet were not reported. Moutou and Durand (1994) used the ICAIR model and explained 10 out of 13 secondary outbreaks, but both their method description and analyses were described very limitedly. S\u00f8renson et al., 2000, S\u00f8renson et al., 2001) used RIMPUFF, developed time-dependent species-specific emission rates, and applied a virus inactivation rate and an infection probability function. They concluded that transmission to the UK was unlikely, as the predicted virus concentrations were about 500 times lower than the assumed threshold concentration to infect cattle. In a sensitivity analysis they showed that 1000 infected pigs were required to infect susceptible cattle up to 300 km downwind.",

For FDMV an intra-farm virus production model was developed for cattle, sheep and pigs, giving the virus amount emitted per infected premise per day (S\u00f8renson et al., 2000, S\u00f8renson et al., 2001). It was used in several dispersion studies (Gloster et al., 2005b; Mikkelsen et al., 2003, Traulsen et al., 2010). A major disadvantage, however, is the lack of dynamics within a population, which herd dynamics models include. Such models are based on multiple infectivity states, such as \u2018susceptible\u2019, \u2018latent\u2019 (infected but not yet infectious), \u2018infectious\u2019, \u2018recovered\u2019, or \u2018dead\u2019. Herd dynamics models calculate the number of individuals in and the transfer rate between each compartment per time unit, where the reproduction ratio R\n0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual introduced in a naive population. The infection will fade out if R\n0 < 1 (either naturally or enforced, e.g., by vaccination) (Bouma, 2005, Hogerwerf et al., 2011); if R\n0 = 1, the infection will be sustained and if R\n0 > 1 an epidemic will occur.",

For instance, Gaussian plume models neglect the heterogeneity of a complex wind field, while models based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulate dispersion at a high three-dimensional resolution.",
