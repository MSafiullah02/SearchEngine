            "text": "Compared to other major coronavirus outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), COVID-19 has been associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular complications (11). In one large cohort study of 138 patients, a significant proportion of patients presented with shock (unspecified; 8.7%), acute cardiac injury (7.2%) and arrhythmias (16.7%), while 4 of 138 patients received unspecified ECMO support (14). Various case series have also reported new-onset heart failure/cardiomyopathy as a complication in up to one-third of critically ill patients admitted with COVID-19 infection (9,15). ST-segment elevation in COVID-19-associated myopericarditis has also led to false activations of the cardiac catheterization laboratory (16). Furthermore, among hospitalized patients, the presence of cardiac injury (defined as cardiac troponin above the 99th-percentile upper reference limit) has been independently associated with a four-fold increased risk of mortality in patients infected with COVID-19 (17), with even poorer prognosis in patients who have underlying cardiovascular disease (18). The mechanism(s) by which COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system remain poorly understood but postulated mechanisms include direct myocardial injury, indirect injury through cytokine release, a prothrombotic state causing microvascular thrombosis, and exacerbation of underlying cardiovascular disease e.g. plaque rupture in susceptible patients (11, 12, 13).",

In one of these patients, mechanical circulatory support in the form of VA-ECMO was used as a bridge to recovery (BTR) with successful hemodynamic and biochemical improvement (20).

Contraindications to VA-ECMO include (but are not limited to) advanced age, life-threatening non-compliance and significant medical co-morbidities (e.g. severe emphysema or cirrhosis) (21). To our knowledge, there are no reported case series\u2019 related to the use of VA-ECMO in prior coronavirus outbreaks including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Accordingly, we anticipate that patient selection for VA-ECMO in the setting of COVID-19 infection will be a challenging task. However, identification of potential clinical scenarios leading to CS and circumstances unique to COVID-19 may facilitate decision-making (Table 1\n), ideally by a multidisciplinary CS team that includes representation of cardiac surgery, cardiology, intensive care, anesthesia, as well as advanced heart failure/transplant physicians.",

            "text": "Unique clinical features of COVID-19 need to be recognized before considering candidacy for VA-ECMO cannulation in patients with circulatory collapse (Table 2\n). Age is an independent predictor of mortality among VA-ECMO patients (4), and in a multivariable analysis of COVID-19 patients by Zhou et al. was associated with approximately 10% increased risk of death per year (9). It is of utmost importance to document the presence of both biventricular dysfunction and a hemodynamic profile compatible with CS, as patients with mixed or predominantly vasodilatory shock may be unlikely to benefit from mechanical circulatory support even in the presence of known cardiovascular disease. Although patients with COVID-19 infection are in a pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic state, coagulopathy has been reported in up to one-fifth of cases (9). Hence, vigilant monitoring for both thrombotic complications (intracardiac thrombi, aortic root/aortic valve thrombi, cannula thrombi, thrombosis of oxygenator) and bleeding may be warranted. Lastly, severe cases of COVID-19 tend to present with multi-organ failure. The use of VA-ECMO in such patients, especially in the presence of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by sepsis, may be considered a futile resource-intensive endeavor. Use of validated prognostic scores such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Survival after Veno-arterial ECMO (SAVE) scores together with clinical judgment should be encouraged to identify those who are more likely to have an exit strategy, such as BTR (22). The use of VA-ECMO during cardiac arrest is beyond the scope of this review. Reported poor outcomes, however, need to be considered before endeavoring to use this approach. We identified one case where a 79-year female patient with COVID-19 infection was emergently cannulated for VA-ECMO during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) but unfortunately this patient died shortly afterward (6).",

ELSO has published guidance (23) surrounding use of ECMO during this pandemic that align with these principles \u2013 namely, that the highest priority should be given to younger patients, those with minor/no medical co-morbidities and healthcare workers. Outside of this, standard ECMO inclusion/exclusion criteria and COVID-19 protective equipment should be used according to local institutional policies, as there are currently no special precautions recommended for contact (23). Although there is a theoretical risk of microbial aerosolization in the ECMO membrane oxygenator, this has not yet been substantiated by evidence (28) and we do not recommend any special precautions other than vigilant decontamination and disposal of equipment as governed by local institution and infection control policies.",

To date, we have not yet had any cases of COVID-19 that have required consideration for VV or VA-ECMO. That said, this is an evolving situation that may change as more affected patients are expected to require critical care beds in the coming weeks to months. In our current circumstances worldwide \u2013 as MacLaren et al. suggest \u2013 resources may well be better concentrated to ensure that enough ICU beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment are available to deal with the influx of patients encountered within the coming weeks to months. As the authors aptly assert, \u201cECMO is not a therapy to be rushed to the frontline when all resources are stretched in a pandemic\u201d (26).",

            "text": "COVID-19 has the potential to cause significant cardiovascular compromise warranting consideration for advanced therapies in a small subset of affected patients. Frontline providers of all specialties must stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving literature and be familiar with therapeutic options for COVID-19 infections. VV and VA-ECMO remain a resource-intensive form of respiratory and mechanical circulatory support that can be considered in extreme circumstances. In the present time of global uncertainty with limited evidence to guide care, we must be mindful of balancing resource scarcity (which may be the overwhelming concern for many healthcare systems in the course of this pandemic) with perceived likelihood of benefit as well as the risk of transmission to other patients, healthcare providers and patient-care environments. We anticipate that ECMO-CARD (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease) \u2013 an ongoing multicenter prospective observational study of ECMO use in COVID-19 \u2013 will inform practice for both VV and VA-ECMO use when it is published (29). For now, it seems reasonable to reserve VA-ECMO for highly selected cases of COVID-19 in refractory CS with echocardiographic evidence of reduced biventricular function, where there is a perceived reasonable probability of benefit as BTR. Discussions around provision of therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis as part of an advanced CS team which involves input from cardiac surgery, cardiology, intensivists, as well as advanced heart failure/transplant physicians to guide appropriate use of this potentially life-saving therapy.",
