The crystal structure adopts an architecture resembling that of PLPs from other coronaviruses. We characterize both conserved and unique structural features likely directing the interaction of PLP2 with the substrates, including the tentative mapping of active site and other essential residues.

The viral papain-like protease (PLP) domain is contained in nsp3 of coronaviruses and participates in the proteolytic processing of the N-terminal region of the polyproteins. It could cleave nsp1|nsp2, nsp2|nsp3, and nsp3|nsp4 sites, while all sites downstream nsp4 are processed by nsp5. 6, 7 Besides cleaving the polyproteins, PLPs also possess a related enzymatic activity to promote virus replication: deubiquitinating (DUB) and de-ISGylating activities, although their physiological functions have not been completely clarified. 8, 9 Both ubiquitin and ISG15 are involved in preventing viral infection, and several viruses have utilized Ubl-conjugating pathways to counter the proinflammatory properties of Ubl-conjugated host proteins. 10, 11 For coronaviruses, one such mechanism relies on evading the host immune response via the action of viral isopeptidase. 12, 13 Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or antiviral drugs against SADS-CoV. Therefore, the rapid identification of targets for the development of antivirals is a high priority. SADS-CoV genome was annotated to contain main protease (Mpro) and PLPs.

Structural analysis, site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies were conducted to identify key active site residues involved in the substrate binding and catalysis. The model of PLP2-Ub complex and kinetic studies facilitates the identification of residues and regions important for ubiquitin binding.

One PLP2 molecule occupies the asymmetric unit. For simplicity, we renumber PLP2 to 1-293. Clear electron density permitted unambiguous modeling of all residues except the ubiquitin-like domain and the loop corresponds to the so-called BL2 loop (250-255 aa). The final model was refined to 1.72 \u00c5 resolution (R work = 17.93% and R free = 21.16%) with a good stereochemistry. Final statistics for the data collection and refinement are shown in Table 1 . The first 52 residues composing N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain was not modeled into the structure because of none electronic density, suggesting it was highly flexible.

But there are several regions with significant differences observed from the overlay, such as the fingers domains have different conformations and extents of closure/opening relative to the palm domains. Since TGEV PLP1 and MERS-CoV PLpro are very similar to SARS-CoV PLpro, 21, 22 and the biochemical and structural studies of SARS PLpro are much detailed, we will focus on the comparison of SADS-CoV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro to get insights into the molecular mechanism of SADS-CoV PLP2. Superimposition analysis revealed some regions with significant differences between SADS-CoV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro. The palm domain aligns much more well than the thumb and fingers domain (Figure 2c ). The first significant difference is observed in the thumb domain. The arrangement of the six \u03b1-helixes is different, in which six \u03b1-helixes of the SARS-CoV PLpro thumb domain are folded slightly more compact than SADS-CoV PLP2 thumb domain, even though the two \u03b2-strands forming \u03b2-hairpins in the thumb domain align well. The second significant difference is observed in the fingers domain. The fingers domain of SADS-CoV PLP2 is much closer to the palm domain in the space, while SARS-CoV PLpro fingers domain tilts slightly away from the palm domain. This results in a relatively different orientation of this region of the structure. Thirdly, there is a big difference between the spatial arrangement between the palm and fingers domain, which is specifically highlighted by the fact that the whole zinc finger domain was shifted approximately 3.68 \u00c5, when the Zinc location was measured. It is notable that this difference between the SADS-CoV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro structure maps to a region that is distant from the active site, including the substrate-binding region.",

In the presence of the structure of an enzyme-substrate complex, the molecular basis of its catalysis and the binding mode of peptidyl substrates or ubiquitin to SADS-CoV PLP2 could be better understood, while attempts to co-crystallization of wild type or mutant forms of PLP2 with different forms of ubiquitin were unsuccessful. But since SADS-CoV PLP2 could cleave at the nsp1|nsp site and nsp2|nsp3 site and whose P1-P4 positions are occupied by the KRGG peptide and KAGG peptide, respectively (KXGG consensus site), resembling the LXGG sequence recognized by SARS-CoV PLpro thus enables using SARS-CoV PLpro bound with Ub (4 mm3) to model the ubiquitin molecule into the corresponding region of SADS-CoV PLP2 ( Figure 3 ). Because there are no loops blocking the active site of apoform PLP2, the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin is easily accommodated in the active site. The \u03b2-barrel of ubiquitin is mainly engaged by the fingers domain of PLP2, whereas the extreme C-terminal tail containing the diglycine motif extends into a groove located at the junction of thumb and palm domains (Figure 3b,c) .",

MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV PLpro appears to have loosely defined pockets in their active sites, even though the crystal structures of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpros bound with one mono-Ub show a network of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the C-terminus of ubiquitin in the active site. 25, 26 More importantly, the di-glycine is in proximity to key catalytic residues and BL2 that are conserved across PLPs ( Figure 4 ). Although the overall pattern of binding the ubiquitin is similar in those from SADS-CoV PLP2 and SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV PLPros, the nature of amino acids of PLPs from these CoVs to bind ubiquitin is somewhat different. These differences are illustrated in the following example involving one salt bridge or The present predicted model reveals that two bulky aromatic residues (W102 and Y257) are partially responsible for the strict requirement for glycines at the P1 and P2 positions of PLPs' substrates ( Figure 3b ). Aromatic residues in proximity to the catalytic cysteine are very common in PLPs because they can aid to increase the nucleophilicity of the catalytic cysteine residue. 27 Residue N99 and K152 also appear to contribute P1 specificity by F I G U R E 4 Sequence alignments of SAD-CoV PLP2, TGEV PLP1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV PLPros. Secondary structural elements of SADS-CoV PLP2 are shown at the top. Absolutely conserved residues are highlighted with red background while conserved residues are shown in red hovering above the active site in a position that could occlude residues larger than a glycine (Figure 3b ). Stabilization of the P3 backbone is contributed by an additional aromatic residue, F248, which corresponds to histidine in both USP14 and HAUSP, and Y265 of SARS-CoV PLpro, Y269 of MERS-CoV PLpro, and Y175 of TGEV PLP1. This residue sitting below the P3 subsite may stabilize the backbone of the substrate by interacting with the P3 residue, as well as orient the bulky P3 side chain out of the cleft (Figure 3b,c) . Due to spatial requirements, the P5 arginine is oriented upward and appears to be stabilized in part by a negative patch on the thumb domain created by two residues, D154 and S157, which are also conserved in USP14 and HAUSP, and SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV PLpro. S157 could form a hydrogen bond with the P5 arginine side chain, whereas D154 hydrogen bonds to the P4 backbone amide as in HAUSP and USP14 and SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV PLpro and TGEV PLP1.",

Many of the interactions that can potentially anchor ubiquitin in the catalytic groove of PLPs originate from hydrogen bonding to the backbone atoms of ubiquitin.

Generally, the oxyanion hole is close to the catalytic center. The amino groups of sidechains of asparagine or glutamine residues in some PLPs could provide the stabilization forces required for the oxyanion hole. 14, 29 The oxyanion hole contains a N99 in the corresponding position is found in SADS-CoV PLP2 structure. Besides N99, W102, which is conserved among coronavirus PLPs, is located over the catalytic cysteine, and may also contribute to the stabilization of oxyanion hole, because the side chain of W102 could form a hydrogen bond with an intermediate in the active site (Figure 2e ). And also several important structural features, including a series of loops surrounding the area, dictate the access to the narrow active site. One such loop is situated at the mouth of the active site and is composed of amino acid residues 92-99. And W102, which we propose to also stabilize the oxyanion hole, protrudes over this loop into the active site (Figure 2e ). And an important interaction between D98 on the loop and F83 behind the loop appears to direct this loop into the active site.",

In SADS-CoV PLP2, the spatially equivalent position is occupied by D96 (2.96 \u00c5 away from Cys101, 3.82 \u00c5 away from His256 and 4.80 \u00c5 away from D269). But D96 cannot act to stabilize the oxyanion in a manner similar to W107 of SARS-CoV PLpro and Q19 in papain because it would be negatively charged and so on could not be the hydrogen donator. Instead, since it is so close to C101 (2.96 \u00c5 from the sulfur atom of the side chain of C101), it might promote Cys101 to perform the catalysis. And D96 is poorly conserved among CoVs (Figure 4) , implying that the interaction between D96 and the catalytic cysteine (C101) might be unique to SADS-CoV PLP2. Meanwhile, in MERS-CoV PLpro, the Trp is replaced by a Leu, one residue who could not be a hydrogen bond donor, and wild-type MERS-CoV PLpro has a lower k cat /K m than the SARS PLpro, whereas Leu to Trp actually increased the k cat /K m 23-fold. 6, 30 BL1 and BL2 block the access to the active site and palm regions when USP14 is in a free state, and these loops are hypothesized to modulate the DUB activity of USP14. 16 The present PLP2 structural model does not contain BL2 because of none electronic density.

N99, which is highly conserved among coronavirus PLPs, is situated above the catalytic cysteine. N99A abolished the enzymatic activity, implicating its crucial contribution to oxyanion hole stabilization and thus catalytic function, as the side-chain amine group of N99 might form H-bond with the negatively charged intermediate's oxyanion. D96A abolished the enzymatic activity for all of the four substrates used in this study, while the side chain of D96 is located very closely to the C101. And the unique interaction between D96 with the catalytic cysteine might account for the differences of the substrate specificity or the catalytic efficiency. But SADS-CoV PLP2 oxyanion hole may not be complete compared to SARS-CoV PLpro, as Y113 in SARS-CoV PLpro is replaced to W102 in SADS-CoV PLP2 and W107 is replaced to D96.",

An interaction between D98 of the loop with F83 behind the loop is likely to anchor this loop into the active site. F83A mutant is inactive in enzymatic assays ( Table 2 ), indicating that the interaction of F83 with D98 is very likely important for preventing it from moving to block the active site access (Figure 3b ).

Differences in the cleaving ability of Ub-AMC by SARS-or MERS-CoV PLpros, TGEV PLP1 and SADS PLp2 may be due to the sequence and structural differences, which affect binding affinities for ubiquitin. The potential of the PLPs to cleave the peptide bond after LXGG has been shown to be dependent on residues flanking the cleavage sites. 5, 29 The nature of P3 and P4 amino acids of the peptide substrates KAGG-AMC and LRGG-AMC cleaved by SADS-CoV PLP2 is significantly different; especially, the amino acid occupying the P4 position that is bound in the active site during catalysis is very different in both substrates, lysine or leucine. Despite this, SADS-CoV PLP2 can cleavage both substrates, conceivably with different efficiencies. Thus, the active site pocket offers promiscuity but at the cost of catalytic efficiency, in which LRGG-AMC was cleaved less efficiently than KAGG-AMC.",

For the P4 site, the surrounding region of SADS-CoV PLP2 has a slightly negative charged patch, which would interact with lysine as a positive charged residue, while leucine is a kind of hydrophobic residue. And this would explain why SADS-CoV PLP2 has a higher catalytic efficiency of KAGG-AMC over LRGG-AMC. Furthermore, the model of PLP2 in complex with ubiquitin supported by the mutagenesis studies provides insights into the molecular interactions between the enzyme and substrate. The extensive interactions predicted between PLP2 and Ub beyond the extreme C-terminal sequence (LRLRGG) may account for the significantly higher activity of PLP2 with Ub-AMC than with the Z-LRGG or Z-KAGG tetrapeptide. So the other residues flanking the active site may have potential changes upon the substrate binding that influence the intrinsic catalytic activity of PLPs, which would be validated through the determination of the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex.",

(b) Comparison of the structure of SADS-CoV PLP2 with those of SARS-CoV PLPro (PDB ID: 4OVZ), MERS-CoV PLpro (PDB ID: 4P16) and TGEV PLP1 (PDB ID: 3MP2). A ribbon diagram shows SADS-CoV PLP2 in yellow, SARS-CoV PLpro in blue, MERS-PLpro in green, and TGEV PLP1 in magenta. (c) Superimposition of the structures of SADS-CoV PLP2 (yellow schematic) over SARS-CoV PLPro (blue schematic) shown in cartoon. Catalytic triad residues are shown in ball-and-stick representations. The orientation of structures shown in (b) and (c) are similar to that of (a). (d) Close-up view of the active site segments for SADS-CoV PLP2 (carbon atoms in yellow) and SARS-CoV PLpro (carbon atoms in blue). The Cys-His-Asp triad and the asparagine as the oxyanion hole residue are conserved in the three-dimensional structures. (e) Proposed SADS-CoV PLP2 active site. Catalytic residues, C101, H256 and D269, and other important active-site residues such as F83, D96, D98, N99, W102, and Y257 are shown in ball-and-stick",
