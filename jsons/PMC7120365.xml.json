These agents target specific components of the immune response (e.g., cytokines, immune cells) that are central to the etiology of the disease process. Biological therapy has brought a paradigm shift in the management of several ARD decreasing the disability and improving quality of life and health outcomes. Biological agents include those that interfere with cytokine function (antitumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 agents [anti-TNF-\u03b1], Tocilizumab, Anakinra); deplete B cells (Rituximab); and downregulate T-cell stimulation (Abatacept) (Table 23.1).1 The most widely used are TNF-\u03b1 antagonists.\n",

However, RCT are underpowered to detect specific risks (particularly rare events) due to short duration of follow-up, relatively small number of patients studied, and exclusion of those with risk factors for complications. During post-approval surveillance, increased risks of serious infections (including opportunistic), malignancies, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disorders, and drug-induced autoimmune syndromes have been reported.2-4 Nonetheless, these findings have been inconsistent and the reported risks and frequencies differ widely (Table 23.2).5-11 Recognized limitations of the different sources of safety data (post-marketing surveillance reports, national registries and meta-analyses), such as lack of a control group and channeling or confounding by indication bias, underlie this variability.12,13 Different mechanisms of drug action and their diverse pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics characteristics influence their safety profile, including the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) (Table 23.1). Patients with ARD have a higher mortality compared to general population, due to increased susceptibility to infections, malignancy, and cardiovascular disorders.14-17 The underlying immune deregulation of these diseases, the concomitant immunosuppression by conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and steroids, and the frequent existence of comorbidities are recognized as major factors. These complex interactions make it difficult to ascribe complications solely to biological agents.\n",

            "text": "An increased risk for serious infections is apparent in patients on anti-TNF therapy (with odds ratios (OR) varying from 1.22 to 2.16), particularly in the first 3 months of treatment and at specific sites of infection (notably the lower respiratory tract and skin/soft tissue) (Table 23.4). Common pathogens prevail (most frequently Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively). This risk appears to be somewhat higher with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (particularly Infliximab), compared to Etanercept, although not all studies agree.6,20 The large induction dose of Infliximab, Etanercept\u2019s lower half-life, and different mechanistic properties between the two anti-TNF antibodies might account for these differences.6,18,22,26 Life-threatening infections are more common in patients with risk factors (Table 23.5)18,26 and usually result from disseminated disease and/or severe pulmonary infections progressing to respiratory failure. A common feature in fatal cases is the paucity of signs or symptoms indicating the severity of developing infections. Pneumococcal pneumonias can rapidly progress to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. Atypical clinical presentation poses a problem in the differential diagnosis with a flare of the underlying disease, as clinical and laboratory signs of infection might be \u201cblunted\u201d in patients on anti-TNF therapy (e.g., absence of fever and elevated acute inflammatory markers). Occasionally, both problems are present. Distinguishing pneumonia and interstitial lung disease secondary to lung involvement and infectious meningitis/encephalitis and central nervous system (CNS) involvement of the diseases can be hard. Estimated death rates attributed to serious infections are generally not available, as these are generally calculated for total SAE. The risk for perioperative infections has rarely been addressed: Two studies showed that therapy interruptions before surgery did not significantly decrease the risk for infectious complications, though a recent study suggested that this risk was twofold lower in patients who stopped the drug for 28 days pre-surgery.27-29\n\n",

Infections of the lower respiratory tract seem more frequent, but are rarely severe. Even the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia (which only occurs with repeated cycles of Rituximab) does not correlate with a significant increase in serious infections. However, levels of the immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgG isotype below 500 mg/dL are a concern (particularly if sustained for long periods).33,34 In case reports of patients with severe pneumonia, concomitant immunosuppressives are invariably being taken. Nonetheless, the biologic effects post-Rituximab on memory B cells and Ig levels, with the concomitant modulation of T-cell immunity, require further investigation.34\n",

For Infliximab, most cases occur sooner after the treatment (first 90 days) than for Adalimumab and Etanercept (median interval above 1 year). These differences suggest that Infliximab-related TB cases are particularly related to reactivation of latent TB, whereas the linearity of the TB infection curve until late phases of treatment with Etanercept is related to reactivation and probably to new infections.44 Screening procedures for the diagnosis and proper treatment of latent TB before initiating anti-TNF therapy reduce significantly the incidence of the infection.45,46 However, cutaneous anergy is more common in RA patients. Indeed, studies from the French registry report that two-thirds of TB cases during anti-TNF therapy occurred in patients with negative tuberculin skin testing (TST) at screening.43\n",

A diagnosis of latent TB warrants the exclusion of active infection before initiation of prophylactic medication. The optimal interval between initiation of preventive treatment and starting TNF blockers is unknown, but observational data suggest that initiating anti-TNF therapy after 1 month of prophylactic treatment for latent TB substantially decreases the risk of reactivation. Likewise, the lag period between initiation of treatment of active TB and starting anti-TNF agents is not defined, but this appears safe after 2 months of treatment for TB.1 Precise guidelines on re-testing patients are not defined, but latest recommendations suggest that in areas of high TB prevalence, or in the event of potential TB exposure, repeat testing should be considered.",

However, some studies included patients without previous screening for latent TB and the results have not shown an increased incidence of TB infection. Differences in the mechanism of action between these new agents and anti-TNF drugs might also cause variance in the risk. Screening for TB is now recommended before initiating treatment with Abatacept and Tocilizumab but not with Rituximab.1\n",

In patients without disseminated disease, the most commonly affected organ is the lung, particularly in those with previous pulmonary disease.

Unlike TB infection, much longer median periods (18\u201343 weeks) between the start of drug use and infection diagnosis are described.

High rates of mortality are reported in patients receiving biologic treatment diagnosed with IFI, particularly with respect to aspergillosis, disseminated candidiasis, and cryptococcosis (ranging from 50% to 100%), and somewhat less with histoplasmosis (20%).50,51 The time for recognition and treatment appears to influence significantly the clinical course and outcome. Host conditions (e.g., neutropenia, environmental exposure) are also determinant factors in the severity of IFI.51 Infliximab is the biologic agent most commonly reported (an estimated increased risk of granulomatous infections 3.25-fold higher with Infliximab versus Etanercept is reported26), but all anti-TNF agents and the other biologic agents may be implicated. Most infections occurred soon after the start of treatment, particularly with Infliximab (median: \u22643 infusions).26,50,51 Close surveillance, a high level of suspicion, and prompt treatment of these life-threatening complications are essential, particularly in high-risk populations (Table 23.5).",

Discontinuation of TNF antagonists is warranted and targeted anti-fungal therapy should be started promptly in a patient with signs of serious infection, not improving while on appropriate antibiotics for common infections, particularly if no pathogen is isolated. Uncertainty remains about when the high-risk period abates after TNF blockade, and thus the question of when it is safe to restart these drugs (if at all) cannot be answered easily.",

PML is a rare, serious, and usually fatal demyelinating disease, which occurs upon reactivation of JC virus, predominantly in severely immunosuppressed populations (such as persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Up to 92% of the adult population is seropositive for JC virus, without clinical disease. However, recent reviews found that immunosuppressed persons other than HIV-positive, notably those with ARD, may have an intrinsically raised risk of developing PML. It appears that SLE patients are at the highest risk.53\n",

The mortality rate reached 90%. CD4+ T lymphopenia was associated with cases occurring sooner after the treatment and carrying higher mortality.54 All patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, at varying intensities. The link between Rituximab use and the development of PML is unclear, as more than 20 patients with SLE not taking Rituximab have been reported to develop PML. Close surveillance remains necessary though, as early diagnosis is crucial.

Most cases are mild diseases, which resolve after discontinuation of the drug.2,4,75 Nevertheless, a growing number of reports of autoimmune processes related to TNF antagonists use have documented rare cases with serious, life-threatening or even fatal complications.75 The most frequent clinical presentations consist of vasculitis \u2013 with an impressive \u223c25% having extracutaneous involvement (peripheral and central nervous system, renal and lung) \u2013 lupus-like syndromes and SLE (with articular, cutaneous, and constitutional symptoms, being the most common features) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Less frequent clinical features include inflammatory myopathies, antiphospholipid syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis.75 The three anti-TNF agents display different risks for the diverse autoimmune disorders, with Infliximab being the most frequently implicated, except for vasculitis where Etanercept has the strongest association. The interval between administration of the drug and the appearance of the autoimmune syndrome varies between 6 and 10 months. Generally, these disorders are self-limiting after stopping anti-TNF therapy but may require corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment.75,76 However, significant morbidity and mortality has also been seen. Reported causes of death were related to renal involvement of vasculitis, with rapidly progressive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-positive glomerulonephritis, and relentless progression of interstitial lung disease.75 A case series found a significant poor prognosis in patients with induced ILD in spite of cessation of anti-TNF therapy and initiation of corticosteroids and immunosuppressives, with more than one half of patients showing no resolution and \u223c33% dying.75\n",

Serious adverse events appear to be rare, but are potentially associated with life-threatening conditions. Several of these are correlated with either the underlying disease per se or the concomitant medication use. Most of them can be avoided by the judicious selection of candidates and adoption of preventive/prophylactic measures. The outcome may be significantly changed by close vigilance and an early proper management. Awareness of the possible serious side effects when using biological therapy is the first essential step for its safer use in patients with autoimmune diseases.",
