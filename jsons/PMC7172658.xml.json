We then searched using keywords \u201cantibiotics\u201d, \u201cbronchiectasis\u201d, \u201crandomised\u201d, and \u201cexacerbation\u201d in the same databases. Our searches were restricted to reports in English. We identified six RCTs investigating antibiotic treatment of exacerbations in adults, of which only one (using inhaled gentamicin) was placebo-controlled. All had small sample sizes (18\u201343), three were open-label, and five compared either different antibiotics or different doses of the same agent. None involved macrolide antibiotics or children. During the study period, we published the results of our parallel study, which showed that, within a 20% margin, azithromycin was non-inferior to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for achieving symptom resolution at 21 days when treating acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis, but that the episodes took significantly longer to resolve with azithromycin than with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. Randomised placebo-controlled trials assessing treatments for exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children are still lacking.\nAdded value of this study\nTo our knowledge, this is the first RCT comparing use of any oral antibiotics with placebo for treating exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. In this three-arm RCT, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate showed benefit compared with placebo in achieving symptom resolution within 14 days in non-severe (non-hospitalised) acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children. Exacerbation resolution was slightly but non-significantly more frequent in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group. Compared with placebo, azithromycin treatment was associated with an increased proportion of azithromycin-resistant bacteria isolated from the nasopharynx.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nEvidence from this study supports the recommendations for use of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate in the treatment of exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children. Taken together with our previously published non-inferiority RCT comparing amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate and azithromycin, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate should remain the first-line antibiotic treatment for non-severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children. Azithromycin could be reserved for use in selected settings, such as in patients with genuine penicillin hypersensitivity or in situations in which less frequent, supervised dosing might overcome difficulties with adherence.\n",

            "text": "Because young children are often unable to expectorate to provide reliable lower airway specimens, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate is usually continued for the whole treatment course. Nevertheless, azithromycin, with its broad antimicrobial spectrum and convenient once-daily dosing, has become a popular alternative to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. Indeed, in some regions of Australia, more than 50% of children undergoing bronchoscopy for chronic cough had received azithromycin in the preceding 2-week period.10 Our previous RCT showed that, after 21 days of treatment, oral azithromycin was non-inferior (within a 20% margin) to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for managing non-severe (non-hospitalised) exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis.11 However, those receiving azithromycin took significantly longer (median difference 4 days) to achieve symptom resolution. Although azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, no superiority RCTs comparing either of these antibiotics to placebo have been done to address the important clinical question of whether oral antibiotics are necessary to treat all non-severe acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis.",

As secondary aims, we assessed the effects of the antibiotics on exacerbation duration, time to next respiratory exacerbation, parent cough-specific quality-of-life (PC-QOL) score,15, 16 systemic inflammatory markers, spirometry, upper airway microbiology, and treatment-related adverse effects, as well as describing the point prevalence of respiratory viruses and atypical bacterial pathogens during exacerbations.",

Nonetheless, we included this antibiotic in our RCT as it is commonly used in settings in which treatment adherence is problematic.10, 26 Although both proportion of children with treatment resolution and median length of exacerbation were similar in the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate (resolution 65%, duration 7 days) and azithromycin (61%, 8 days) groups, the differences between azithromycin and placebo were not formally statistically significant. However, the duration of exacerbation could only be meaningfully calculated in those whose exacerbation had resolved by day 14 because the children who exited the study protocol or did not achieve resolution were given open-label antibiotics per study protocol (and including them in the analysis would thus not reflect the true effect of intervention), and the number of children with resolution in placebo group was significantly lower than those in the antibiotic groups. Our previous RCT showed that, although 3 weeks of oral azithromycin treatment was non-inferior (within a 20% margin) to 3 weeks of oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for achieving symptom resolution by day 21 in children with non-severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis,11 the episode duration was significantly shorter in children allocated to receive amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate (median duration 10 days [IQR 6\u201315]) compared with azithromycin (14 days [8\u201316]). This difference in duration is clinically significant because of the stress, anxiety, and loss of work for parents associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations.4 Nevertheless, in the current study, when compared with placebo, both antibiotics by day 14 had similar effect sizes with respect to symptom resolution and episode duration. Indeed, the p value comparing azithromycin to placebo was 0\u00b7042, suggesting that statistical significance might have been achieved in a two-arm comparison between azithromycin and placebo (ie, without the need to adjust for multiple comparisons). Furthermore, given the higher-than-anticipated proportion of participants who achieved resolution in the placebo group, it is possible that this study was insufficiently powered to show statistical superiority of azithromycin. Taken together, this and our previous RCT11 support the empirical use of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate treatment as the first-line antibiotic choice for non-severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children. Furthermore, data from this study indicate that azithromycin increased the proportion of azithromycin-resistant bacteria in the nasopharynx, which is a recognised reservoir for the transmission of antibiotic-resistant organisms.27\n",

We used 45 mg/kg per day of the 7:1 amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate formulation. Although 80 mg/kg per day amoxicillin is recommended for treating childhood pneumonia in settings where penicillin resistance is common in S pneumoniae,28 the combination of H influenzae as the predominant lower airway pathogen8 and a declining prevalence of antibiotic-resistance in S pneumoniae\n29 suggests that the lower dose of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate might have been sufficient and, at worst, we might have underestimated the antibiotic effect. Similarly, in the absence of studies comparing different doses of azithromycin to treat lower respiratory tract infections or bronchiectasis exacerbations, the commonly recommended 5 mg/kg per day regimen was used. This dosage corresponded to the total weekly dose of 30\u201335 mg/kg used successfully in a previous RCT of long-term azithromycin to reduce exacerbation frequency in children with bronchiectasis,30 although higher daily doses of 12 mg/kg for 5 days have been used in preschool-aged children with acute wheezing illnesses.31\n",

Virus-associated exacerbations are known to be more severe and more likely to necessitate intravenous antibiotics and hospitalisation than those in which respiratory viruses are not detected.13 In the placebo group, the median duration of exacerbation was 11 days in the virus-positive group and 7 days in the virus-negative group (appendix pp 7\u20138). Although we cannot explain the increased viral presence in both the antibiotic groups compared with the placebo group, the baseline parameters of the exacerbation were similar among all three groups (table 1). The role of viruses in non-severe bronchiectasis exacerbations should be explored further, and more studies are needed to identify the subset of non-severe exacerbations that might resolve without antibiotics. We plan to evaluate this further by exploring various clinical and microbiological factors associated with the resolution of exacerbations.",

Azithromycin was associated with some improvements in exacerbation resolution and duration compared with placebo, but did not meet the threshold for significance defined in this three-arm trial. Importantly, azithromycin was also associated with an increase in the proportion of bacteria with azithromycin resistance compared with placebo. The results suggest that amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate should remain the first-line oral antibiotic for the treatment of non-severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children, with once-daily azithromycin reserved for those with genuine penicillin hypersensitivity or for situations in which directly observed therapy is feasible in settings of poor treatment adherence.",
