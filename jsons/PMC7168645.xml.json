            "text": "This lack of effective vaccine candidates against HMPV can be explained by the recent discovery of the virus, but also by the lack of a successful vaccine against closely related RSV that could serve as a base for vaccine design. One of the reasons for the slow progress in this field is the clinical failure of formalin-inactivated RSV-vaccine (FI-RSV) that occurred in the 1960s. The administration of FI-RSV led to the development of an exaggerated immune response to wild type (wt) RSV infection with enhanced pulmonary disease (EPD) and two vaccinated children died [26]. EPD has been further documented in various animal models, indicating that it is not only a human phenomenon [27,28,29,30]. A similar effect was observed for a formalin or heat-inactivated HMPV vaccine, which induced the symptoms of EPD in rodents [31,32]. Another reason for slow vaccine development is the transient immunity provided by natural infection with RSV and HMPV. As documented in RSV-seropositive adults, levels of RSV-neutralizing antibodies correlate with the resistance to subsequent RSV infection, but the protection they confer is incomplete and short-lasting, which results in frequent reinfections [20,33]. The immune response to primary HMPV infection was described to be weak and aberrant in BALB/c mice, with excessive Th2-cytokines production at later stages of infection, which correlated with airways hyperresponsiveness and the development of asthma [34]. Pneumoviruses have also developed many mechanisms to evade immune responses. The RSV nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 suppress the IFN-induced antiviral response in infected cells and removal of these proteins resulted in the induction of high levels of IFN alpha and beta in vitro [35,36,37]. HMPV shares with RSV the same ability to decrease IFN response, despite the lack of NS1 and NS2 proteins. It has been documented that HMPV-G protein has the ability to inhibit the IFN type 1 response in vitro and in vivo [38,39] and that its SH and M2-2 proteins can also modulate the host\u2019s immune responses [40,41,42]. Both HMPV and RSV can persist in the lungs of an infected animal host, despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies [34,43]. Such persistence has been documented by RT-PCR detection of viral RNA in the guinea pig and mouse models for RSV [44,45,46] and in mice for HMPV [43]. Another hurdle to effective immunization is the presence of maternal antibodies in the bloodstream of vaccinated infants that can impair the immunogenic effect of the vaccine [47], yet the role of maternal antibodies in RSV infection is not fully understood [48].

Viral protein antigens can be used as subunit vaccines to induce an appropriate immune response. These proteins can be delivered as nanoparticles, virus-like particles (VLPs), or they can be coupled with adjuvants [49]. Another interesting strategy is to immunize with viral nucleic acid coding for viral antigens, as it has been documented for RSV and HMPV vaccine candidates [50,51,52]. An mRNA-based vaccine coding for the F proteins of HMPV and human parainfluenza type 3 virus (PIV3) has been recently advanced to phase 1 clinical trial [53]. ",

            "text": "Among the three surface proteins of HMPV (F, G, and SH), the F protein constitutes the major HMPV antigen [6,54,55]. Although immunogenic, its G protein does not induce a potent protective immune response [54,56] and is not indispensable for viral replication in vivo [57]. HMPV-SH protein was shown not to confer any significant protection [54], the same being observed for RSV [58]. The F protein is also the major antigen of RSV, more immunogenic than the G protein [59], although the latter is also able to induce a protective immune response [60,61] and has been frequently tested as a subunit vaccine [62,63,64]. RSV-F protein stabilized in its pre-fusion form by introducing disulfide bond (DS) and cavity-filling (Cav1) mutations (DS-Cav1) is currently being tested as a subunit vaccine in phase I clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03049488). The pre-fusion RSV-F was shown to be more immunogenic than its postfusion conformation, as a result of an exposition of a unique antigenic site \u00d8 that is recognized by very potent RSV-neutralizing antibodies [65,66,67]. Trials with the HMPV-F subunit vaccine showed that the vaccine was immunogenic, but not protective in a rodent model [68]. To increase its immunogenic potential, HMPV-F protein has been stabilized in its pre-fusion state by analogous strategies as for RSV-F, but its immunogenicity was not enhanced [69,70]. This difference between pre-fusion RSV-F and HMPV-F can be explained by additional glycosylation at the apex of the pre-fusion form of HMPV-F. HMPV-F and RSV-F share some antigenic sites, and antibodies able to cross-neutralize the two pneumoviruses were identified [71,72,73,74,75]. Grafting of a major protective epitope from RSV-F into HMPV-F protein resulted in the elaboration of a chimeric protein carrying epitopes of both pneumoviruses, an interesting candidate for vaccine design [76,77].",

ResVax has been recently tested in phase 3 clinical trials in maternal immunization model of lower RTIs prevention in infants (NCT02624947), where it did not meet its clinical endpoint [81]. VLPs are structures composed of the proteins of viral capsid; they do not contain the viral genome and are replication-incompetent. Coexpression of HMPV-F, -G, and -M proteins leads to the formation of VLPs in vitro [82], yet the expression of only F and M proteins has been shown sufficient for VLPs assembly [83]. Several potential VLPs vaccines against HMPV [82,83,84,85], and many more against RSV [78,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105], were developed, but none of them has been advanced to clinical trials. A promising vaccine candidate\u2014a VLP composed of pre-fusion, postfusion RSV-F, or both together, assembled with HMPV-M protein\u2014conferred full protection against RSV infection in immunized mice [96].

In this case, it is possible to obtain a vaccine that presents all viral epitopes and is able to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses [106]. The main disadvantage of live attenuated vaccines is the risk of reversion of the attenuated profile, restoration of infectivity and subsequent development of the disease [107]. Live attenuated viruses can be divided into two groups: non-recombinant and recombinant or chimeric viruses. Non-recombinant viruses are rendered less infectious due to genetic modifications that appear naturally during serial passages in vitro in conditions of environmental stress. Several attenuated strains of RSV and HMPV have been obtained as a result of serial cold passages or chemical mutagenesis, which confer a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype to a virus [108,109,110,111,112]. Apart from the mentioned selection strategy, recombinant attenuated viruses can be generated by reverse genetics, a technique that makes it possible to generate functional particles of a modified virus based on its genetic material [113,114]. This approach allows not only to introduce attenuating mutations directly into the viral genome [57,115], but also to express exogenous antigens in the backbone of the virus, leading to the development of polyvalent, chimeric vaccines. The insertion of a foreign gene can have a potentially attenuating effect on its own, for example, by rearranging the order of genes in terms of 3\u2019-5\u2019 expression gradient, as it is observed in paramyxoviruses. Gene order can also be changed in a more invasive way by moving virulence genes from the high-expression position to the low-expression locus. Alternatively, the replication efficiency can be decreased by deletions or silencing of nonessential viral proteins that play an accessory function in the life cycle of the virus. It is also possible to swap some of the genes between strains of different host preferences, thus introducing new host range restrictions. HMPV virus with the P gene exchanged for its AMPV_C counterpart (rHMPV-PA) was more attenuated than wt HMPV, and yet protective against HMPV infection in African green monkeys (AGMs) [116]. In this review, we will focus on and discuss in detail the development of live recombinant vaccines against HMPV.",

Similarly to RSV, the target populations for HMPV vaccination are young children, elderly people, and pregnant women [117]. Early vaccination of infants and young children can potentially prevent HMPV-infections and the transmission of the virus. Replication-competent vaccines, namely, live-attenuated HMPV or recombinant viruses are a good choice for this population. Another vaccine strategy, prime-boost regimen, consists of vaccinating with gene-based/live vaccine first and then with a protein/particle-based vaccine [118]. Immunization of pregnant women can not only provide a passive antibody transfer to their children but also prevent a mother-to-child transmission of HMPV. Live vaccines are considered being too risky to be used in this population; therefore, subunit vaccines or VLPs with standard adjuvants should be considered. The effect of vaccination of adult populations with live vaccines can be hampered by the presence of anti-HMPV antibodies in the bloodstream or in the respiratory tract (RT). For the vaccination of elderly people, who had experienced multiple HMPV infections, subunit or VLPs with a potent adjuvant are recommended [118]. ",

            "text": "One of the strategies aimed to circumvent the problem of incomplete immunity provided by natural HMPV infection is to express its protective antigens in the backbone of a more immunogenic virus. The increase in immunogenicity can also be provided by improved antigen expression by the vector, as demonstrated for a recombinant bovine/human PIV3 (rB/HPIV3) expressing either RSV-F or G proteins [60] and for human parainfluenza type 1 virus (HPIV1) expressing HMPV antigens [54]. HMPV is difficult to grow in cell culture; vectoring its antigens with the backbone of a better-replicating virus can facilitate vaccine development and manufacturing. For instance, rB/HPIV3 expressing RSV-F reaches 10\u2013100-fold higher viral titers in vivo compared to wt RSV [60] and replicates more efficiently in the RT of AGMs than wt RSV or HMPV [119,120]. Expression of a foreign antigen in the backbone of another virus can also mitigate the problem of pre-existing immunity that often diminishes the effect of the vaccine. Using vectors of another host range can facilitate the immunization of seropositive individuals with no risk of causing disease, as it has been described for Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) expressing RSV-F. The majority of live vaccines against RSV and HMPV up to date have been attenuated by a few codon changes in their genome. Therefore, using more stably attenuated backbone can render the attenuation more reliable, and decrease the risk of the reversion of an attenuated phenotype. The insertion of an additional gene can itself influence the virus\u2019 replicative capacity, thus limiting its ability to spread and cause the disease, but also to create the risk of overattenuation. This subtle balance between attenuation and immunogenicity remains the major challenge of vaccine development. ",

            "text": "In general, vector-based chimeric vaccines retain the advantages of live attenuated vaccines and they can be readily generated by reverse genetics. Most of the backbones used so far for vectoring pneumoviral antigens belong to the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are closely related, both phylogenetically and structurally, to pneumoviruses. This close relationship increases the chance of an efficient expression and integration of a pneumoviral protein in the background of a paramyxoviral vector. Among paramyxoviruses, the most widely used vaccine backbones are bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) and its recombinant derivative rB/HPIV3, HPIV1, parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), and Sendai virus (SeV). The reasons explaining this frequent use of paramyxoviruses as vaccine backbones are numerous: First, their genomes are well-characterized and complete genomic sequences of all known members of this family are easily accessible [121]. Second, their genomes are simple and organized in a modular way. Tandem alignment of the genes, of which the most are transcribed as separate mRNA products, facilitates genetic manipulations [122]. Third, most paramyxoviruses are able to replicate efficiently in cell lines certified for vaccine manufacture, such as Vero cells, which can facilitate vaccine development [122]. Fourth, as they replicate entirely in the cytoplasm and their replication cycle does not involve the integration into the host cell genome, their use is potentially safe [121]. Also, recombination events between mononegaviruses have not been observed in nature and they remain extremely rare in vitro, even in optimized conditions [123,124], indicating that there is a low probability of gene exchange between engineered vaccine viruses and the pathogens present in the environment. Fifth, the small probability of recombination also contributes to the stability of a genetic insert, providing a stable foreign gene expression system. Paramyxoviruses are able to stably express several exogenes simultaneously and the level of expression can be manipulated by changing the position of gene insertion [125]. Sixth, most paramyxoviruses infect their host via their RT, representing an easy and safe route of administration of the vaccine as well as for induction of both local and systemic immune responses. Last, but not least, there are many animal paramyxoviruses that are naturally attenuated in humans due to a host range restriction. Mutations that render these viruses harmless to people have been identified and characterized, thus making attenuation of different paramyxoviruses possible [122]. ",

The genomic RNA of paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses does not exist as an unbound RNA-particle: it is always assembled with numerous copies of N protein and forms a helicoidal nucleocapsid. In paramyxoviruses, each N protein molecule is associated with precisely six nucleotides, a feature that is believed to underlay the \u2018\u2019rule of six\u2019\u2019, i.e., the length of the genome of paramyxoviruses has to be a multiple of six for an effective viral replication [134,135]. The stringent adhesion to this rule is observed for SeV [136]; for other viruses, like PIV5, NDV, and HPIV3, it strongly increases the efficacy of replication [137,138,139]. The fact that it does not give any replicative advantage to RSV [140] might be explained by distinct differences in nucleocapsid structure of the two families [141]. Transcription of the viral genome is initiated at the 3\u2019-end and a 3\u2019-to 5\u2019 expression gradient is observed. The complex of vRNAP sporadically fails to resume the synthesis of another distinct mRNA at each gene junction, which results in a gradual loss of transcription-efficacy along the genome [121].",

As it has been documented in numerous studies, the GS and GE signals of the vector virus can efficiently direct the expression of an exogenous protein [60]. Although GS and GE signals are often highly conserved along the viral genome, there might be variations in their sequences and transcription efficacy [142]. Flanking the sequence of GFP inserted into the 6th genome position of PIV5 with GS/GE specific for either 2nd or 7th gene junctions resulted in large differences in GFP expression levels (Figure 3) [143]. GS/GE characteristics for the 1st junction provided better expression levels than the ones originating from the 7th. It is therefore important to flank the exogene with potent transcription regulators. In accordance with the 3\u2019-5\u2019 transcription gradient, exogenes placed in more 3\u2019-proximal position should be expressed better than 5\u2019-proximal inserts, yet the tendency cannot be described as linear and some deviations are observed [144]. The adherence to this gradient might also be influenced by the type of attenuation of vector virus, as it has been demonstrated for HPIV1 bearing RSV-F protein [145]. The positions of an exogene in the viral genome are described in Figure 3 and the nomenclature used to label chimeric viruses in this review is explained in Figure 4. ",

RSV-F insertion into 1st position of rB/HPIV3 genome reduced the expression of downstream genes by 20\u201345% [146]; 2nd genomic position can provide a good expression, but it can also influence the N:P protein ratio, which plays a decisive role in the replicative capacity of paramyxoviruses, causing an additional attenuating effect [146]. Insertions in either 1st or 2nd genomic positions are the most privileged for PIV3-based vectors, with the 2nd position usually providing better virus recovery, higher viral replication, and better exogene expression [147]. For some vectors, namely, NDV and Avian paramyxovirus serotype 3 (APMV3), the 3rd position is the most advantageous, whereas the insertion at the 2nd one results in delayed viral replication and the largest reduction in virus recovery [148,149,150]. The 4th and the 5th positions are not frequently used, so as to not influence the expression of vector\u2019s surface proteins (F and HN) [146], with the exception of studies on SeV bearing either RSV-F or HMPV-F at the 5th position [151,152,153].

The rB/HPIV3//RSV-F1st virus showed an 8-fold reduced replication in vitro compared to rB/HPIV3, whereas the RSV-G1st insert did not influence viral replication [60]. This decrease in viral growth might have been due to excessive syncytia formation and increased cytopathology resulting from the expression of a second fusion protein. Another reason might have been the size of the insert\u2013a bigger F protein might have influenced the replication more significantly than a smaller G protein. The size of an exogene can significantly change the replicative capacity of the virus, as it has been shown for HPIV3 vector bearing inserts of different sizes [154]. The level of integration of a foreign protein into a vector\u2019s particle can also be a price to pay in the exchange for efficient expression of the exogene, as described in Chapter 5 of this review. Improved exogene integration into the vector\u2019s backbone can be obtained by the substitution of the transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the inserts with their equivalents from the vector virus. As demonstrated for HPIV1 vector bearing RSV-F protein either in its wt or chimeric TMCT form, packaging of RSV-F(TMCT) was strongly improved, but the chimeric virus was overattenuated and not protective in hamsters [155].

            "text": "Newcastle disease virus, an avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV1) virus, is an important poultry pathogen that recently drew a lot of attention for its potential use both as an oncolytic agent and as a vaccine vector. Although it is recognized as an avian pathogen, it has been experimentally proven to infect several mammal species including mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, ferrets, calves, pigs, and non-human primates. Natural NDV infections are very rare in humans; the cases of infection have been documented in bird handlers exposed to the virus [178,179] and no human-to-human transmission has ever been observed [180]. Various NDV strains are classified as low virulent (lentogenic), mildly virulent (mesogenic), or highly virulent (velogenic). Concerning the high contagiousness of NDV and its potentially detrimental impact on the poultry industry, lentogenic strains of NDV were classified as biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) pathogens, with mesogenic and velogenic strains being BSL-3 pathogens [181]. Some lentogenic strains, namely, LaSota and B1, are used as naturally-attenuated vaccines to protect the poultry. Although mesogenic NDV strains are not frequently used as vaccine vectors, a mesogenic strain Beaudette C (BC) tested as a vaccine vector for the HPIV3-HN protein in non-human primates was well-tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the LaSota strain [182].

It is highly immunogenic, inducing a potent IFN type 1 response [183]. Its genome is approximately 15.2 kb in length and the virus adheres to the rule of six for efficient replication [180]. The virus can accommodate exogenes up to 4.5 kb in length and it can effectively express three additional proteins [184]. An exogene can be placed at the gene junction between any two genes of the virus, yet the 3rd position has been found to be the most optimal for NDV vector [149,182,185,186] with the 1st and the 2nd ones being the least optimal [148,149]. NDV has been used for vectoring the antigens of RSV [185], AMPV [187,188,189], HIV [149,190,191], HPIV3 [182], influenza A virus [192], SARS-coronavirus [186], Nipah virus [193], and Ebola virus [194].

The immunogenicity of this construct was strongly improved when AMPV_C-F and G proteins were expressed together from the 5th genomic position of NDV genome [189].

It provides a good level of protein expression: Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein (CAT) expressed from the 5th position of VSV genome constituted 1.7% of all the proteins produced by rVSV-infected cells [195]. The expression of VSV genes follows the polar gradient observed for paramyxoviruses, and 3\u2019-proximal insert positions influencing N:P proteins ratio, can be detrimental for virus replication. An N:P ratio between 1:1 and 2:1 has been shown optimal for viral replication, whereas a ratio below or above this value was associated with decreased replicative capacity of the virus [196]. ",

This neurotropism results in significant viral replication in brain and mortality in mice infected by VSV [200], raising some serious concerns about using this virus as a vaccine vector. Although VSV is not a human pathogen, some human infection can occur as a result of contact with infected animals [201,202,203]. One case of encephalitis caused by VSV infection was reported in a 3-year-old boy from Panama [204]. Because of significant morbidity in VSV-infected cattle, VSV has been included in the list of potentially harmful agents by the United States Department of Agriculture [205]. ",

Efficient expression of native RSV-F and RSV-G proteins from the 5th and the 4th genomic positions, respectively, has been also documented for rVSV, but the viruses were not tested in vivo [208]. RSV-F5th constructs were also tested in the context of a VSV backbone attenuated as a result of G protein deletion (rVSV\u0394G) [209]. The studies showed that rVSV\u0394G backbone is more attenuated and less immunogenic than rVSV and that the combination rVSV\u0394G with RSV-G antigen was not efficient for immunization. A non-propagating recombinant VSV bearing a deletion in the membrane-proximal domain of its G protein (VSV-GSTEM) was used to vector RSV-F and G proteins and tested in vivo as an intranasal or intramuscular vaccine [210].

This strategy of attenuation is based on the restriction of replication in vivo based on the host incompatibility of some of the viral components. In the first study, an HMPV chimera with either N (rHMPV-NA) or P (rHMPV-PA) gene exchanged for its AMPV_C counterpart was tested as a vaccine in hamsters and AGMs (Table 6). The N and P genes of AMPV_C share 75 and 68% nucleotide sequence identity with their HMPV counterparts, which suggested good integration of heterologous proteins into the HMPV particle [4,211]. rHMPV-NA and rHMPV-PA viruses replicated more efficiently in vitro, compared to their parental HMPV strain. When tested in vivo in hamsters, the replication of both chimeric viruses was decreased 100-fold, and rHMPV-NA was slightly more attenuated than rHMPV-PA. Both chimeras were equally immunogenic and protected the vaccinated animals from wt HMPV infection. When tested in AGMs, rHMPV-PA was more attenuated than rHMPV-NA and was almost equally immunogenic, and both chimeras conferred protection against wt HMPV [116]. This study identified the more attenuated HMPV-PA chimera as a more promising vaccine candidate for further development. The rHMPV-PA virus has been recently tested as a vaccine in phase 1 clinical trial sequentially in adults, HMPV-seropositive and HMPV-seronegative children (NCT01255410) [25]. The trial found rHMPV-PA virus being appropriately restricted in adults and seropositive children, yet insufficiently infectious and immunogenic in HMPV-seronegative children, thus leaving no other candidates for an anti-HMPV vaccine in clinical trials.

This can be achieved by TMCT domain swapping between the insert and the vector, as it has been demonstrated for the rB/HPIV3//RSV-F2nd virus [67]. Swapping of either the CT domain or TMCT domains increased the packaging efficiency 19\u201320-fold, reaching the level of RSV-F packaging into wt RSV virions. RSV-F(TMCT) insert did not influence the incorporation of vector\u2019s HN protein but it decreased the packaging of its F protein by 50\u201360%. TMCT modification did not influence viral replication in vitro, but it resulted in 101\u2013102- and 102\u2013103-fold increase in attenuation in hamsters and rhesus macaques, respectively. Similar packaging improvement and restriction in hamsters were observed for rHPIV1-C\u0394170 bearing RSV-F(TMCT) at the 1st or the 2nd gene position [155]. Interestingly, neither CT [208] nor TMCT domain exchange [207] improved packaging efficiency of RSV-F into VSV-GP particles, yet TMCT modification was necessary to efficiently express surface proteins of other viruses, for example, HIV-1 [212,213]. This proves that exchanging TMCT domains could be an attractive strategy to increase the incorporation of HMPV antigens into vector\u2019s particles, yet this modification can cause an additional attenuating effect on the chimeric virus and each combination of a vector with antigen requires individual design.

It is supposed that this effect is due to interactions between these two surface glycoproteins that are closely associated one to another when expressed simultaneously within the same infected cell. Considering the structural similarities between RSV and HMPV, it might be presumed that the simultaneous expression of both HMPV-F and G proteins could have a beneficial effect on the efficacy of the vaccine, as it was also demonstrated for AMPV_C [189]. However, the study performed on virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing HMPV-F alone or along with the G protein showed that co-incorporation of the HMPV-G protein into VLP does not improve the immunogenicity conferred by the F protein [84]. Therefore, it is not likely that coexpression of HMPV-F and G could improve the vaccine\u2019s immunogenicity and other improvement strategies should be considered. ",

The HMPV virus expressing two additional copies of its F gene and one additional copy of its G gene from the 1st genomic position has been described [130]. The expression of F and G protein mRNA by this recombinant HMPV was increased more than 6-fold and 14-fold, respectively, compared to wt HMPV. The in vitro replication of this recombinant virus was approximately 7-times reduced comparing to wt HMPV, which is a relatively small reduction, considering the fact that the genome length of the virus was increased by 30%. This study showed that adding additional copies of the ORF of HMPV-F or/and G could potentially increase the expression of its antigens also in the backbone of other vectors. ",

            "text": "HMPV and RSV are important pediatric pathogens. Despite many years of research, no vaccine against either HMPV or RSV is currently available, underlining the need for novel solutions for vaccine design and/ or optimization of existing strategies. Generation of recombinant chimeric vaccines that protect against more than one pathogen is an advantageous and practical solution for elaborating a promising vaccine candidate. Many studies were performed on vaccines containing an antigen of RSV expressed by a heterologous virus, mainly the F protein, and some of these bivalent vaccines were advanced to clinical trials. Although the possibilities of generating chimeric vaccines against HMPV were less-explored than for RSV, numerous similarities between the two viruses can serve as a guide for the design of anti-HMPV vaccines. The antigens of HMPV and RSV were successfully expressed by various viral vectors, most of which belong to the Paramyxoviridae family. Notwithstanding that paramyxoviruses can readily express exogenous proteins from an added gene in their genome, many different factors condition the viability of a chimeric virus, the efficacy of exogene expression and the immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate. Not only does the choice of vector virus need be taken into consideration, various other aspects, namely, the positioning of an exogene in the vector\u2019s genome, the size and the type of an insert, and the possibility of integration of a foreign protein into the vector\u2019s particle, should be thoroughly considered. Numerous studies on the engineering of chimeric viruses indicate that each combination exogene\u2013vector must be carefully designed and individually verified. Recombinant vaccine candidates against either HMPV or RSV that have been designed up to date indicate that using another virus to express HMPV antigens, or vice versa, can make it possible to overcome some major hurdles in HMPV vaccine development and obtain a good balance between immunogenicity and attenuation of a live recombinant vaccine.
