In particular, accurately analyzing the spread size of information such as a virus in a human society is one of the growing concerns in diffusion problems. For example, recent epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza A, and Ebola, show that viruses can easily spread on a global scale. Similarly, rumors and trends can also spread quickly and widely to alter human behavior. Furthermore, analyzing the spread size and density of information can be used to maximize the influence of the information. With the growing usage of online social networks (OSNs) and blog sites, predicting spread size to measure the influence of the information is taking on added significance. Many companies are now performing viral marketing on OSNs, and they rely on the word-of-mouth of adopters to influence other people to increase product sales. Since companies can only perform viral marketing with a limited advertising budget, predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of viral marketing strategies (in terms of number of final adopters) is of the utmost importance.",

In these models, a person is represented by a node, and a relationship between people is represented by a graph structure of the nodes. Information such as whether or not a person is an iPhone user or is infected by an epidemic are assigned on each node as a state. For example, in the epidemic model, each person (i.e., node) can be assigned one of three states: infected, not infected, or recovered.",

In this setting, each infected (or activated) node attempts to infect its neighbors independently and succeed with a fixed probability or rate. The independent cascade model\n[7] is also one of the models that aims to explain the opinion spreading process and can be regarded as an SIR model. In the independent cascade model, every influenced node has a single chance to influence each of its uninfluenced neighbors. Recently, the Hawkes point process model was used to analyze user activities in social networks [8,9]. It is known that the rate of events in an extended model is identical to the rate of new infections in the SIR model [10].",

[4] analyzed the general voter model by the mean-field approximation on networks that disregard the specific connection pattern. Sahneh et al.\n[19] constructed a generalized epidemic spreading model for multistate and multilayer networks and provide a mean-field approximation for the overall density. In recent studies, a pairwise mean-field approximation [20\u201322] that improves the accuracy of the mean-field approximation has been studied. In the pairwise approximation, the approximation is performed through the probability of the state combination of two connected nodes to consider the dynamical correlation between neighbors [23,24]. However, these studies focus only on the specific spreading model, so they have limitations in scalability. Moreover, the theoretical accuracy of the approximation is not properly shown.",

The GOSM represents models that update each node's state with some probability that is dependent on the present node's state and its neighbors' states. Then we focus on GOSMs that have the stable property, which can be seen as a GOSM version of a uniform equicontinuity. In essence, we define a GOSM as stable when slight changes in the state density of a set of nodes do not cause a dramatic change in the state transition probability in the next step.

Pairwise approximation also approximates the true expected state density with an error of less than 0.1% in most cases, similar to the generalized mean-field approximation. Therefore, generalized mean-field approximation method approximates the state density under various SIS model parameters and able to perform as good as the pairwise approximation. In addition, in some cases, error of generalized mean-field approximation is smaller than the pairwise approximation. If the infection probability \u03b2 is large, as shown in Fig. 3, the error is drastically larger than in other cases. We believe that the reason for this phenomenon is because the experiment was conducted in a discrete environment. The pairwise approximation assumes a continuous time step, but larger \u03b2 represents that the experiment move away from continuous time step environment.\n",

Recall that Corollary 5 provides a lower bound on the probability such that we can predict the state density with a small error by running one Monte Carlo simulation. For a given T, the lower bound on this probability approaches 1 as the number of nodes in the graph becomes sufficiently large.

            "text": "We have previously considered two different uniform initial state distributions. Now, we consider a nonuniform initial state distribution as follows. For each network, the nodes with the top 50 highest degrees are initially selected as active nodes, while all other nodes are initially in the \u201cnonmember\u201d state. Figures 8 and 9 show the results obtained on the BA10000 and Gowalla data sets with this initial condition. Here, the DAU model has parametric value set P1. Figures 8 and 9 show that for all data sets, a single Monte Carlo simulation run can provide an accurate prediction of the density of any given state in the steady state for the case in which W contains all nodes with nonzero (in)degrees and for the case in which W contains at least the top 10% of the nodes as ranked by (in)degree. Figure 9 shows that if W contains a small fraction of the nodes with the highest (in)degrees, e.g., the top 1% of the nodes, then a single Monte Carlo simulation run can accurately predict the expected density of the active state for most time steps. The results obtained on the WS10000,100, Gowalla, and Slashdot data sets are similar.\n\n\n\n",

Then, for any node set W containing a large number of the nodes in V, a single Monte Carlo simulation run is sufficient to accurately predict the expected state density in any time step. Otherwise, suppose that the minimum degree requirement in Theorem 1 is not satisfied for the given network G. For example, the data set may be very sparse, or it may contain a large fraction of nodes with very low (in)degrees. The experimental results demonstrate that even in this case, for a given W containing a large state density or nodes with high (in)degrees, a single Monte Carlo simulation run is still sufficient to predict the state density to a certain accuracy. Moreover, for the case in which W contains only a small fraction of the nodes in the network, e.g., only 1%, one Monte Carlo simulation run is still sufficient to effectively predict the trend of the change in the expected state density.",

Many discrete-time spreading models, such as the voter model, the DAU model, the independent cascade model, and the SIS model, can be formulated as GOSMs. In addition, we have shown that many well-known GOSMs have the stability property, which is the GOSM equivalent of uniform continuity. We prove that for a slightly dense network, our generalized mean-field approximation method can successfully compute the state density. Our approximation is applicable to all stable GOSMs, unlike the conventional mean-field approximation. Extensive experiments confirm that generalized mean-field approximation method indeed computes the state densities for the given nodes very well in practice. We have shown that a single Monte Carlo simulation run can also be used as a cost-efficient means of approximating the state density both theoretically and practically. Our results can be applied to various practical problems arising in social networks, including epidemic spreading analysis, the influence maximization problem [30], and viral marketing [31]. Two possible avenues for future work include relaxing the structure condition that requires a slightly dense network and generalizing our results to continuous-time Markovian opinion spreading models.",
