            "text": ". In their report, Huang et al. present three patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for the resection of lung nodules concerning for malignancy between January 14 th and 17 th , time during which COVID-19 cases steadily started to increase in China and around the globe (4, 5, 6) . Substantial amount of information related to this novel disease has been disseminated since the outbreak, however studies and guidelines specific to the risks and considerations of thoracic surgery to patients in this environment (as opposed to health care personnel and hospital systems) are lacking (7) . Here, the authors report highly concerning results regarding COVID-19 infection in three patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy at their institution, located in Wuhan, China. All three patients were asymptomatic before the operation but developed typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection such as fever, cough and dyspnea between post-operative day 1 and 6. Computed tomography scan showed bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities and lung consolidation, consistent with COVID-19 imaging findings reported in the literature (8) . RT-PCR testing was performed and was positive between post-operative day 5 and 9. One of the three patients recovered and was discharged home on post-operative day 46 (pathology showed atypical adenomatous hyperplasia). Unfortunately, the other two patients died on post-operative day 8 and 17 respectively (pathology confirmed T1bN0M0 adenocarcinoma). It is unknown whether these patients acquired the infection prior to or after hospital admission, as they were not tested for COVID-19 until developing signs and symptoms of pneumonia. There is a possibility, as described by the authors, that these patients contracted the infection before surgery and were in the incubation period at the time of operation. This illustrates the challenges in making a diagnosis given the absence of typical COVID-19 symptoms, non-existing policies for pre-operative testing, and limited test kits at that time. Universal pre-operative COVID-19 testing for patients undergoing surgery, a policy that is in place at many institutions, may not only to mitigate the risk of exposure to healthcare personnel, but also identify patients who could potentially develop pneumonia postoperatively.",

Patients with pure ground-glass opacities or with known typical carcinoid tumors in peripheral locations can likely be safely delayed for at least a few months. Borderline candidates for lobectomy may be better served with sublobar resection or stereotactic radiosurgery instead.",

On the other hand, surgeons can take some solace in the fact that among 126 patients in this study who underwent lobectomy between January 1 st and March 31 st in Wuhan, only 3 patients were discovered to contract COVID-19. It is also possible that there were a number of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections in this group, which would result in a lower calculated mortality rate. Hopefully, larger studies of the impact of COVID-19 on the risk of surgery will follow; in the meantime, the decision to embark on lung surgery in the time of COVID-19 will rely on physician judgment using the limited available data, assessment of the local situation with regards to COVID-19, and patient preference.",
