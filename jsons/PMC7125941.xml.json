Other prevailing infectious diseases such as SARS, tuberculosis, and dengue are also briefly discussed. These infectious diseases are chosen as they are most prevalent in resource-scarce communities and they contribute the most to disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (Mabey et al., 2004, Yager et al., 2006). This review is written in a disease-centered structure in contrast to the technique-centered approach by Jung et al. (2015), Su et al. (2015) and also Damhorst et al. (2015)\n. Individual diseases are described here with their current diagnostic/treatment platforms. Gaps in managing these infectious diseases are also identified and the potential of microfluidic technologies to bridge the gaps is discussed. We believe that the disease-centered approach can enhance the knowledge of readers researching in specific disease fields on the utility of microfluidics. Additionally, we hope to use this review to encourage further research in infectious diseases such as SARS which have generated low scientific interest in the microfluidics community thus far (Fig. 1\n).",

The marked decrease in membrane flexibility can be attributed to two main factors. Firstly, as the relatively non-deformable parasites mature into the trophozite and schizont stages, it causes the internal viscosity of RBCs to increase sharply (Quinn et al., 2011). Secondly, membrane rigidity can be attributed to the export of neoantigens to the surfaces of RBCs and the parasites exerting oxidative stress on the host RBCs (Becker et al., 2004). The increase in deformability can precipitate important pathophysiological outcomes such as reduction in flow velocity (McWhirter et al., 2011), increased adherence to vasculature, channel clogging and thickness of cell-free layer (Yin et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Based on this knowledge, Hou et al. investigated the use of deformability as a biomarker for on-site iRBC enrichment using inertial microfluidics (Fig. 3A) (Hou et al., 2010). The team exploited the margination phenomenon to isolate iRBCs. It was found that with the increase of hematocrit to 40%, more than 80% of the iRBCs (in trophozoite/schizont stages) were displaced to the side channels, demonstrating the importance of cell\u2013cell interactions to observe margination. However, the maximum flow rate was only 5 \u03bcL/min and this platform could not differentiate different species of the Plasmodium protozoas. Furthermore, as RBC deformability is also a characteristic of other diseases such as sickle cell anemia, improvements in specificity is warranted. Geislinger and colleagues also enriched less deformable ring-stage iRBCs with an average enrichment factor of 4.3 and throughput of 12,000 cells/h based on a separation process driven by the non-inertial lift effect (Geislinger et al., 2014). Warkiani et al. made use of the negative depletion approach to remove leukocytes from lysed blood before also using inertial focusing (Warkiani et al., 2015). Approximately 70% of the parasites released from iRBCs could be captured as identified using quantitative (q) PCR and 99.9% of the leukocytes was depleted. The device also boosts a sensitivity of 2\u201310 parasites/\u03bcL, better than current sensitivity of RDTs. This device can be coupled to other diagnostic methods to form an integrated platform as it can enrich the malaria parasites to facilitate sensitive detection.",

            "text": "Guo and colleagues capitalized on the differences in pressure threshold (attributed to deformability differences) between healthy RBCs and iRBCs as they passed through progressively narrower constrictions (5 to 1 \u03bcm) to study the malaria disease (Guo et al., 2012). Previously, Tomaiuolo and co-workers have also provided a description of RBC viscoelastic properties such as shape as a function of the applied pressure drop using microfluidic devices (Tomaiuolo et al., 2011). Guo et al. found that iRBCs in the schizont stages were typically blocked by the 3 \u03bcm constriction and this blockage significantly elevated the deformation pressure. Similar results have been found by Shelby et al. who found that trophozoite staged iRBCs experienced difficulties passing through 4 and 2 \u03bcm constriction and schizont stage iRBCs blocked these small constrictions (Shelby et al., 2003). Using their microfluidic device, Guo et al. then showed that the stiffness of ring, trophozoite and schizont stages iRBCs to be 1.5, 7 and 200 times more than uninfected RBCs. These results differed from the measurement using optical tweezers where the values are 3, 4 and 10 respectively (Hosseini and Feng, 2012). The discrepancy in membrane stiffness highlights the importance of establishing standards for tools that measure cellular membrane properties. This microfluidic device may also be suitably adapted to study phenomena such as pitting and RBC recovery after traversing through narrow constriction. It has been shown that under flow conditions, healthy RBCs do not become part of a vascular occlusion but rather wind their ways through the center of the iRBCs to exit from the constriction (Shelby et al., 2003). The usefulness of microfluidic devices is hence not limited to malaria diagnosis as it can mimic channel blockage at different bifurcations (Huang et al., 2013) to test the clinical usefulness of therapies such as transfusion (Riddle et al., 2002) and also drugs.",

            "text": "Microfluidic platforms using membrane deformability as a biomarker for malaria may hold great promises but its suitability is arguably challenged in the face of emerging knowledge on malaria. It has been reported that the deformability of uninfected RBCs can be reduced in cases of severe malaria (Dondorp et al., 1999). The exact mechanisms are unknown but it has been suggested that in vitro cultures of P. falciparum can produce heat-labile exoantigen that decrease RBC deformability (Naumann et al., 1991). The damaging effect of lipid peroxidation on RBC membrane flexibility has also been proposed to explain the aforementioned phenomenon (Mohan et al., 1995). The use of microfluidic has also provided valuable insights in the differences between P. falciparum and P. vivax infected RBCs. Handayani et al. constructed a microfluidic device with a narrow constriction of 2 \u03bcm and observed that in contrast to P. falciparum infected RBCs, P. vivax infected RBCs at all developmental stages were able to transverse the gap smoothly (Handayani et al., 2009). They postulated that the increase in internal viscosity of P. vivax infected RBCs could be offset by the increase in membrane deformability. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing our knowledge about the malaria disease and the interactions of malaria parasites and RBC hosts. With greater understanding of the malaria biology, deformability-based diagnostic tests can be more robustly designed. Other groups have utilized concepts relating to electrical impedance (Zheng et al., 2013) and transit time (Rosenbluth et al., 2008) to differentiate blood and cancer cells. These concepts may be extended for malaria detection provided that RBCs and iRBCs are sufficiently distinct in these key parameters.",

            "text": "Dielectrophoresis which refers to spatially non-uniform electric fields either due to direct current or alternating current has also been utilized for malaria-related study and diagnosis. Dielectrophoretic (DEP) forces are generated when dielectric particles i.e. polarizable electrical insulators such as cells are subject to direct or alternating electric field. When the cells move in the direction of increasing electric field gradient or intensity, the behavior is called positive DEP and the converse is termed negative DEP (Pethig and Markx, 1997). Readers can refer to Pethig for mathematical equations governing the generation of DEP forces on spherical and non-spherical particles (Pethig, 2010). As the DEP responses of cells depend on the composition (permeability, capacitance, conductivity) and conformation of their cell membranes, cells of different types, sizes and physiological states can be differentially isolated (Gascoyne et al., 2002) using different media and frequency of the electric field. Gascoyne et al. demonstrated the possibility of using DEP to isolate iRBCs (Gascoyne et al., 2004) as the electrical conductivity of iRBC is significantly higher than uninfected RBCs (Aceti et al., 1990) attributing to membrane permeation pathways induced by malaria parasites. In their DEP-field-flow fractionation (FFF) microfluidic device, they observed that nucleated blood cells remained in the DEP-FFF chamber and emerged only after the electric field was turn off, preventing leukocytes contamination. Next, by applying a certain frequency of electrical signal (40\u2013250 kHz), iRBCs were levitated more strongly than uninfected RBCs and emerge more rapidly from the DEP-FFF chambers. Consequently, the initial cell isolate contained only Plasimodium protozoa. Du and coworkers also utilized DEP stretching to characterize the differences in biophysical properties of healthy and infected RBCs (Du et al., 2014). The latter was found to have expectedly lower stretching ratio due to rigid membranes.",

Microfluidic PCR can have higher sensitivity than conventional PCR (Rubio et al., 1999). Furthermore, the faster speed, adaptability to \u03bcTAS and portability of microfluidic PCR greatly boosts its usefulness in resource-scarce regions where malaria is endemic (Wang et al., 2009). In addition, microfluidic devices which only require small sample volume and have high surface area to volume ratio offer higher temperature transition speed, more uniform heat distribution and reaction efficiency.",

In the former, the PCR mixture is housed in one unit which experiences temperature change during the PCR cycle. This method requires lower sample volume but runs the risks of longer reaction time and non-uniform heating and cooling. In the latter method, there are pre-fixed temperature zones and the PCR mixture flows from one unit to another. This approach, however, only operates with a fixed number of PCR cycles and may be more complex to fabricate, resulting in bulky devices. Currently, droplet microfluidic PCR is also being tested (Tewhey et al., 2009). Microfluidic PCR readout has been integrated with electrochemical, fluorescence gel electrophoresis that minimizes loss due to transferring of amplified nucleic acids and contamination (Park et al., 2011). Zhang et al. and Park et al. have done an excellent review on microfluidic PCR and readers are encouraged to refer these remarkable references for better technical information on this subject (Zhang et al., 2006, Park et al., 2011). Given the specificity of the primers in the PCR process, this approach can be applied to diagnose for most infectious diseases as long as sufficient genomic material can be extracted. The technique described in this section is therefore also applicable for other infectious diseases.",

This innovation can be useful when coupled to downstream microfluidic platform to create a \u03bcTAS for malaria diagnosis which was also suggested by Gascoyne et al. (2004). Although there has been much discussion on a \u03bcTAS that incorporates concepts such as deformability and PCR for more comprehensive diagnosis of malaria, to the best of our knowledge, such system is probably still at the developmental phase. It can also be beneficial if loop meditated thermal amplification (LAMP) PCR, one of the most sensitive and specific PCR method (Hopkins et al., 2013), can be integrated with a portable microfluidic device. We also stress the need to combine innovations created for different PCR components to create a truly functional prototype. This is because various improvements have been made for instance, the creation of microfluidic digital recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) SlipChip for quantitative detection of DNA by Shen et al. (2011), but amplification is only one step of PCR. Technologies facilitating better mixing of reagents or concentrating samples should be integrated to build the most effective \u03bcTAS for diagnosis.",

The ubiquity of optical instruments and their wide range of resolution and lenses angles make them valuable tools for the study and monitoring disease progression (Psaltis et al., 2006). Nonetheless, conventional optical microscopy is bulky and expensive. Recently, however, this field has evolved with the emergence of cheaper optic alternatives enhanced with add-ons such as wave guides to create portable diagnostics (Hunt and Wilkinson, 2008). The charge-coupled device (CCD)-based platforms (Ozcan and Demirci, 2008) have been developed to monitor cells and particles movement through shadow imaging without fluorescence imaging. Other detection modes include absorbance, chemiluminescence and interferometric (Myers and Lee, 2008). For instance, Juul et al. made use of combined DNA cleavage-ligation event with droplet microfluidic for malaria parasite enzyme activity detection. This microfluidic platform can operate with a detection limit of less than 1 parasite/\u03bcL of unprocessed blood (Juul et al., 2012). Mobile phones, which can also function as a imaging platform, have also been employed in imaging thick and thin Giemsa-stained smears of P. falciparum iRBCs in brightfield with a mounted light microscope (Breslauer et al., 2009). Recently, Horning et al. described a paper cartridge coupled with an automated image processing software to detect for malaria parasites (Horning et al., 2014). The cartridge consisted of both thin and thick smear regions for species identification and limit of detection (~ 100 parasites/\u03bcL) enhancement respectively (Fig. 3D).",

Firstly, it is the emergence of cheaper and portable optical instrument that can be used to observe cellular interactions in microfluidic. Optical microscopy can be combined with microfluidic to enhance on-chip detection of RBC deformability or changes that are specific for diseases. In this regard, Kim et al. created a mini-microscope for in-situ monitoring of cells by modifying off-the-shelf components of a commercial webcam (Kim et al., 2012). Comparison of images of cells taken with the in-house microscope and a conventional microscope revealed that the magnification of the former was comparable to a 40 \u00d7 objective lens (approximately 400 \u00d7 magnification). Affordable and yet powerful optical tools can too facilitate the emergence of cheap optical detection such as by secondary speckle sensing (S3) microscopy (Cojoc et al., 2012).",

The team stained iRBCs with 2% Toluidine blue and with its SRFOM, achieved an image resolution of 0.66 \u03bcm at the highest acuity. This method circumvents sample preparation such as fixation unlike the conventional microscopic detection method. However, SRFOM shares similar limitations as the microscopic technique as it is unable to identify ring stage iRBCs, limiting its usefulness for early malaria detection (Erdman and Kain, 2008).",

Paul et al. reported that iRBCs behave like paramagnetic particles in a magnetic field (Paul et al., 1981). This has motivated research in using magnetic means to identify iRBCs (Bhakdi et al., 2010). Zimmerman and colleagues proposed the idea of using magnets to concentrate iRBCs to enhance the sensitivity of microscopic method for detection of malaria (Zimmerman et al., 2006). Nam et al. designed a microfluidic device that capitalized on the magnetic properties of accumulated hemozin in iRBCs to separate iRBCs from malaria culture as Fe3 + in hemozin has a stronger paramagnetic effect than Fe2 + in hemoglobin (Nam et al., 2013). The team incorporated a nickel wire in the microfluidic device to create a steep magnetic gradient to achieve > 90% in ring stage iRBC recovery rate (Fig. 3E). Nonetheless, this device works below the flow rate of 1.6 \u03bcL/min and the team also has yet to show the creation of a homogenous magnetic field. In addition, the concentration of hemozin may be skewed by the number of parasites i.e. singlet, doublet and triplet (Malleret et al., 2011) in iRBCs which may decrease the specificity of the microfluidic device in informing the users about the severity and stages of malaria. As aforementioned, the amount of hemozin is also lower in ring stage iRBCs and for low parasitemia levels, posing yet another challenge for early malaria detection. Peng et al. more recently made use of magnetic resonance relaxometry to detect for hemozin in iRBCs (Peng et al., 2014). This new approach can detect for < 10 parasites/\u03bcL of whole blood and may be adapted into a microfluidic device by using portable magnets and radio-frequency detection probe.",

Escherichia (E.) coli is the most common cause of early-onset sepsis in neonates (Camacho-Gonzalez et al., 2013). Recently, different approaches have been presented by researchers for detection of E. coli. For instant, methods such as magnetic separation, fluorescence staining, electrical detection and microfluidic immunoassay were used to capture and identify E. coli from blood (Yang and Li, 2006, Wang et al., 2012b) (Fig. 4A). Golden et al. developed a multi wavelength microflow cytometer using grooved microfluidic channel. E. coli assays were performed to demonstrate the capability of the device in discriminating particles (Golden et al., 2009). Bisceglia et al. also utilized DEP microfluidic device to isolate E. coli (Bisceglia et al., 2015). These chips can reduce diagnosis time by bypassing bacteria culture. However, further work is desired to reduce the processing time (~ few hours to few min) and the use of highly diluted blood. Kang and colleagues integrated expertise in DNAzyme-based sensor, droplet encapsulation and particle counting system to create a comprehensive droplet digital detection (IC 3D) system (Fig. 4B) (Kang et al., 2014a). This platform can detect as low as 1 E. coli bacterium in diluted blood sample in a culture/amplification-free process. Schwartz and Bercovici leveraged on isotachophoresis and fluorescently labeled antimicrobial peptides to continuously remove E. coli that are suspended in water (Schwartz and Bercovici, 2014). This technology may be potentially applied to detect bacteria in bodily fluids especially in early sepsis onset or sepsis suspect.",

            "text": "Identifying the strains of sepsis-causing bacteria can guide therapeutic intervention. Recently, Patterson et al. reported a novel microfluidic chip-based detection and strain discrimination of microbial pathogens, particularly for Salmonella serovars derived from whole blood of septic mice (Patterson et al., 2013). Mahalanabis et al. also created a microfluidic based detection system for cell lysis and DNA extraction of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, known causative of sepsis that may be coupled with PCR to construct a \u03bcTAS (Mahalanabis et al., 2009). An improved version would be to create capabilities to differentiate even bacteria strains within the same gram family. STMicroelectronics and Mobidiag have unveiled a lab-on-chip system for DNA-based detection of ten sepsis-causing bacteria as well as methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus (S.) aureus from positive blood culture samples. Similarly, Hou et al. have also made use of spiral inertial microfluidic technique to isolate different strains of bacteria with numbers as low as 10\u2013100/mL (Hou et al., 2015) (Fig. 4C). This platform has also been coupled to RNA detection to profile antibiotic resistance of pathogens. Making use of mannose binding lectin (MBL) coated magnetic beads and subsequent magnetic flux concentrator, Cooper et al. were able to spread captured Candida (C.) albicans fungi (99%) thinly to optimize optical imaging (Cooper et al., 2014). Wang et al. argued that it is also important to differentiate live from dead bacteria to prevent unnecessary administration of antibiotics (Chang et al., 2014). The group thus designed a microfluidic system based on ethidium monoazide-based assay and PCR to probe for live bacteria from fluid isolated from periprosthetic joint infection.",

            "text": "Several groups have also capitalized on biochemical composition in septic patients for diagnostics and monitoring. Evidence shows that excessive nitric oxide production plays a key role in the cardiovascular manifestations of sever sepsis and septic shock (Boveris et al., 2002). Hunter and colleagues fabricated an amperometric nitric oxide (NO) microfluidic sensor with low background noise to monitor changes in blood NO levels, as a potential biomarker, during the onset of sepsis, and its configuration enabled rapid analysis of NO in small sample volumes (Hunter et al., 2013). Conventional systems for antibiotic susceptibility testing is often too long (16\u201324 h) for the timely treatment of sepsis. In their study, Choi and co-workers introduced a microfluidic based system that reduced anti-microbial susceptibility testing (AST) assay time for determining minimal inhibitory concentrations, by single bacterial time lapse imaging (Choi et al., 2012). Schotter et al. also reported the incorporation of magnetic markers with magnetoresistive sensors applied in the microfluidic device for cytokine-based diagnosis of sepsis (Van Der Wouden et al., 2011). One potential complication of this diagnostic method is that increased production of NO and cytokines could be triggered by other diseases and not necessarily a response to sepsis. Furthermore, individuals are likely to differ by their norm NO levels and the minimal inhibitory concentrations for AST. This may make this diagnostic technique become expensive due to a need to establish personalized reference/standard.",

Shen et al. developed microfluidic systems with surfaces of phospholipid bilayers patterned with TF to demonstrate experimentally the threshold responses of initiation of coagulation to the size and shape of surfaces presenting TF (Shen et al., 2008). Thermal injury can trigger an inflammatory cascade that heralds shock, SIRS and even death (D'Avignon et al., 2010). To address the prognostic and diagnostic significance of chemotaxis after burn injury, microfluidic devices have been exploited to measure neutrophil directional migration speed in response to chemo-attractant gradients that can be established in response to infection (Butler et al., 2010). Using this assay, Butler et al. established a reference set of migration speed values for neutrophils from healthy subjects in comparisons with samples from burn patients. Boneschansker et al. also quantified leukocyte migration patterns (chemoattraction, repulsion, kinesis and inhibition) using their microfluidic device when different chemokines were added (Boneschansker et al., 2014). The group has extensively quantified the persistence and speed of migration with different dosage and receptor expression.",

For instance, there are microfluidic tools that quickly identify infection by offering highly sensitive bacterial isolation (1 E. coli in 1 \u03bcL of undiluted blood sample) in less than an hour. There are also microfluidic platforms developed to monitor sepsis progression by monitoring biochemical changes in patients' bodies that are induced by sepsis. Furthermore, microfluidic tools providing information on antibiotic susceptibility and possibility of mixed infections have also been created to guide septic treatments. All in all, these microfluidic techniques can facilitate faster, more sensitive, cheaper way of targeting different stages of sepsis (infection, progression, mixed infection, antibiotic resistance etc.) that can guide clinical interventions. Nonetheless, a key challenge now will be to understand the limitations of these different diagnostic techniques and possibly integrate all these capabilities to create a platform that can provide bacterial/fungi strain identification and AST assay with high sensitivity of < 10 bacteria/mL and in a timely (< 30 min) manner.",

            "text": "Current sepsis treatments usually involve antibiotics therapy with patients in critical conditions start antibiotic treatment immediately, even before the test results that identify the bacteria strain come back from the laboratory (Yung et al., 2009). The complexity and variability of the sepsis are more devastating in patients with antibiotic-resistant pathogens because of the lack of effective drugs (Kang et al., 2014b). Extracorporeal blood purification (i.e., hemofiltration) was suggested by Gotloib et al. in 1994 to be useful in septic lung injury resulting from the removal of inflammatory mediators (Gotloib et al., 1984). Novel theories have been proposed in order to explain the beneficial effects of high-volume hemofiltration (HV-HF) in severe sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) therapy, although this hypothesis remains a subject of significant debate (Bouman, 2007). In general, there is no universal consensus on which components of the blood should be removed for better clinical outcome. To address the root of the problem, extracorporeal blood cleansing therapy that can rapidly remove microorganisms and endotoxins from blood has been proposed by Xia and colleagues in 2006 (Xia et al., 2006). Using a simple microfluidic system, they have shown successful removal of living E. coli bacteria bound to magnetic nanoparticles from solutions containing densities of red blood cells similar to that found in blood. The team further enhanced the throughput of their system using a multiplexed version of their earlier design with over 80% bacteria capture efficiency at a flow rate of 20 mL/h in a single pass (Yung et al., 2009). More recently, the same group came up with another design where they made use of magnetic beads coated with MBL to cleanse blood of bacteria, fungi, endotoxins without activating the complement cascade and coagulation (Fig. 4F). 90% of E. coli and S. aureus was reportedly depleted that also helped reduce immune cell response and inflammation (Kang et al., 2014b). Nonetheless, one main concern of using this technique is the lack of full understanding of nano-toxicity induced by the magnetic nanoparticles. This is because the biocompatible coatings on the nanoparticles can be degraded over time, exposing healthy cells to toxic free metal ions from the core. Furthermore, the method uses low flow rate (20 mL/h) in order to achieve high bacterial capture efficiency while the average body normally houses 5000 mL of blood. An extracorporeal blood cleansing procedure of 500 mL would require 25 h which may infeasible to implement continuously due to easy bubble formation and clogging in microfluidic channels.",

In addition, margination, the natural phenomenon where leukocytes move toward the sides of blood vessels (Goldsmith and Spain, 1984), has inspired novel method for treating sepsis. For instance, based on margination phenomenon, a high-throughput and label-free microfluidic blood filtration technique for microbial removal from whole blood was introduced by Hou et al. (2012). They have demonstrated high removal efficiencies of ~ 80% and ~ 90%, for E. coli and S. cerevisiae pathogens, respectively. More recently, the same team has reported successful removal of pathogens from a murine model of sepsis at flow rate of ~ 90\u2013150 mL/h using a 32-channel parallelized platform, demonstrating the feasibility of their systems as a blood cleanser in clinical settings (Fig. 4E) (Hou et al., 2015). As aforementioned, a huge issue in using the microfluidic channels is the possibility of clogging especially when whole blood with natural coagulants is being filtered. In addition, while these techniques offer high throughput in a few hundred mL/h, there is still insufficient characterization on the effects of high shear forces on the integrity of RBCs and potential immune activation of leukocytes.",

It is also necessary to pursue higher bacterial isolation efficiency as there is the danger that the microfluidic platforms may propagate the spread of bacteria in the patients' bodies. In addition, these platforms generally lack comprehensive long-term characterization of immune response to potential debris from microfluidic substrates and other materials used such as magnetic beads.",

The retrovirus is primarily transmitted to the host via fluid exchanges during sexual contact or contaminated needles (horizontal epidemic), but can also spread from an infected mother to her child (vertical epidemic). Despite the lack of any obvious signs, the infected individual actually undergoes continuous loss of CD4 + T cells, eventually crippling the immune system and allowing the patient to succumb to opportunistic infections (e.g. pneumonia). This later stage is termed as AIDS (Dalgleish et al., 1984).",

Differential surface CD4 expressions and sizes influence cell binding on antibody-functionalized surface, allowing lymphocytes and monocytes to be differentiated. The platform has a specificity of ~ 95% in regard to CD4 + lymphocytes (versus monocytes) capture and can perform the detection in less than 10 min. However, this platform relies heavily on the coating of antibody on the microchannel surfaces and with a lack of technology for strict quality control, reproducibility of well-coated platforms with antibodies may be compromised. Furthermore, the orientation of the CD4 + lymphocytes as they flow through the microchannels may not expose them to the coated surfaces, thus reducing diagnostic sensitivity.",

Their designed software is able to account for uneven background, overlapping cell images and detect for cells with multiple stains, offering great flexibility to HIV detection. Kim and colleagues also made use of optimal imaging with quantum dots to identify HIV (Kim et al., 2009). Dual-labeled quantum dots were able to recognize external envelope gp120 protein and high mannose glycans at 20 ng/\u03bcL, the lowest dilution limit, and with high sensitivity. Ramachandraiah and co-workers made use of centrifugal microfluidic on a functionalized CD platform for automated counting of CD4 + lymphocytes using microscope (Ramachandraiah et al., 2013). Wang et al. also developed an m-ELISA to detect CD4 + cell in unprocessed blood. Each step in ELISA was spatially confined and cellphone was used to quantify the number of CD4 + cells (Wang et al., 2014). To overcome potential loss of signal, Chin et al. capitalized on the effects of reduction of silver ions onto gold nanoparticles (Sia et al., 2004) and meandering channels for signal amplification (Chin et al., 2011) (Fig. 5B). Their fully-functional m-chip requires only 1 \u03bcL of unprocessed blood for HIV and syphilis diagnosis with near 100% sensitivity and specificity. Microfluidic platforms integrated with imaging capabilities facilitate automated diagnostic results that are not subject to users' interpretations and biases. However, to make these integrated platforms accessible to developing nations where there is much higher HIV infection rates, the imaging components must be cheap and portable like the cell-phone based system Wang et al. developed but yet with comparable spatial resolution sensitivity.",

Primers targeting p24 (a major core protein) and gp120 are utilized in this biochip. This platform can perform diagnosis in less than an hour and is supposedly more accurate than the use of antibodies. However, in this device, the highly unstable RNA is currently isolated externally and may introduce inconsistencies and contamination due to technicians' skills. It is worth exploring the possibility of on-chip RNA isolation and amplification as discussed in Section 2.3 molecular analysis for malaria diagnosis.",

Therefore, the current technique for microfluidic diagnostic for HIV depends highly on the use of antibodies targeting CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes. However, HIV stages and progression, can reduce the specificity of binding. Furthermore, when target lymphocytes flow through the microchannels, due to unsteady flow rates and differential cell sizes, they may not be oriented properly to be exposed to the antibody coatings on the microchannels, hence reducing diagnostic sensitivity. The cost for antibody coating can also be prohibitive as antibody solution is usually used in excess. This can creates an issue of irreproducible manufacturing. While DNA/RNA based technique circumvents the problem of antibodies reliance and can offer higher sensitivity and specificity, no group has yet to create a fully integrated system that is free from users' skills and biases. Nonetheless, interested groups can learn from research in the malaria field where on-chip nucleic acid isolation and amplification have been demonstrated.",

The system was able to provide positive results from 17 (out of 18) of the clinically diagnosed SARS patients while conventional RT-PCR with agarose gel electrophoresis gave only 12 positive results (Zhou et al., 2004). Huh et al. also developed a microfluidic platform that integrated magnetic force-activated micromixer system and functionalized surfaces for cell lysis, purification of intracellular proteins and SARS-CoV detection (Choi et al., 2002). Similarly, Ramalingan and colleagues made use of isothermal helicase-dependent amplification method to detect for SARS virus DNA on an integrated microfluidic PCR chip (Ramalingam et al., 2009). Similar to HIV, as SARS is caused by a virus, there is limited techniques for diagnosis as HIV viruses are difficult to isolate. Currently, there are only a few microfluidic-based diagnostic platforms for SARS detection. The platforms that make use of antibody (against SARS-CoV) functionalized surfaces face the problems of non-specific binding due to disease progression and reproducible manufacturing of functionalized surfaces. The antibodies can also be expensive and be used in excess in order to fully functionalize the microchannel surfaces. This can increase the cost of the microfluidic device and makes it less accessible to patients in the developing nations. On the other hand, nucleic acid-based method offers higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to antibody method. However, this latter technique requires a longer diagnostic time for nucleic acid isolation and amplification. There must also be precise temperature control for efficient amplification to occur which may add manufacturing complexity to the diagnostic chip. Respiratory infectious diseases represent the one of the largest cause of deaths and DALYs lost (Yager et al., 2006). Therefore, techniques in areas of immune-affinity, optics are encouraged to be applied to this area to boost disease diagnosis.",

Although this is a largely treatable diseases, the large number of undiagnosed cases (global detection rate ~ 63%) prevent timely therapeutic interventions (McNerney and Daley, 2011). Readers are encouraged to refer to review by Dheda et al. for a more comprehensive discussion on available diagnostic tools such as liquid culture, smear microscopy and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for tuberculosis (Dheda et al., 2013). Conventional diagnostic means for tuberculosis face the same limitations as other infectious diseases diagnosis such as poor specificity, high costs and large volume of sample needed (Mani et al., 2014). To this note, microfabricated devices may potentially fill some of the gaps in diagnostic efforts for tuberculosis. For instance, Wojcik and co-workers designed a colorimetric DNA test based on conjugation between gold nanoparticles covalently bound to the gene fragment of the Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis (Bernacka-Wojcik et al., 2013). This test requires only 90 ng of target DNA and 30 min for completion. Multiplexed kits using multiple antigens specific for M. tuberculosis have also been developed (Dheda et al., 2013). Liong et al. made use of magnetic barcoding technique to detect DNA of M. tuberculosis in 2.5 h (Liong et al., 2013). The team describes a partially integrated microfluidic platform where the DNA of M. tuberculosis is first extracted externally and then captured onto polymeric beads with complimentary capture DNA. The beads are then coupled to probe-DNA bound magnetic nanoparticles which render the MNP-loaded beads paramagnetic. As the paramagnetic MNP-loaded beads can produce local magnetic fields, beads loaded with different quantity of M. tuberculosis DNA produce different decay rate when subject to nuclear magnetic resonance readings, allowing diagnosis to be performed. A portable microfluidic device capable of performing on-chip loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) with manual inspection has also been designed by Fang and colleagues for tuberculosis detection in 1 h (Fang et al., 2012). Recently, a label-free assay for detection of DNA of M. tuberculosis and related drug resistance has been designed (Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2015). This platform makes use of the quantification of hydration induced stress on micro-cantilever functionalized oligonucleotide probes before and after hybridization with specific nucleic acid targets. The total analysis time is 1.5 h and a sensitivity of 2 pg/mL was reported. However, in these described methods, the platforms are not fully integrated and require off-chip processing steps such as nucleic acid extraction which may affect the reproducibility of the diagnostic results due to skills of the technicians/users.",

Although there are currently not many microfluidic devices created for tuberculosis diagnostic, there are other point-of-care assays that may be potentially integrated with microfluidics such as those making use of mass/piezoelectric (Ren et al., 2008), optical (Buijtels et al., 2008), enzymatic (Xie et al., 2012) and acoustic techniques (He et al., 2003). Nanotechnologies are also emerging as highly useful tools to enhance the sensitivity of signals for diagnostic results (Vandan et al., 2009).

However, some of the challenges deserve to be highlighted for innovators and we will briefly mention two of them. (1) Financing. Diagnostics targeted for resource-scarce communities have to be priced low to be competitive and accessible. This creates pressure for profit generation and may not appeal to private venture capitalists. Therefore, it is more likely that companies that can serve both developed and developing nations flourish in the market. Governments and philanthropic foundations such as Bill and Melinda Gates have helped commercialize POC diagnostics for resource-scarce communities and we expect them to continue playing significant role in financing. (2) Integration. As mentioned earlier in Section 2.3, the various technologies such as for fluid delivery, mixing and on-chip heating and cooling for microfluidic PCR has to be combined to create a functional product. Another example is the acquisition of Advanced Liquid Logic which specializes in electrowetting and droplet microfluidic by Illumina for its molecular diagnostics business arm. There is a need for collaboration amongst different teams or even companies to capitalize on one another's expertise.",
