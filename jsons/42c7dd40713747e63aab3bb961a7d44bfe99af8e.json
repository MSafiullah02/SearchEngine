First of all, our team has developed techniques for identification of virions based on a modular atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The scientific goal is, in addition to virus diagnostics, to identify structural changes of the virus surface at an early stage, using so-called tip enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) together with coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS), see Fig. 1 . This combined technique will improve the sensitivity and consequently speed up acquisition times considerably. In contrast to known methods, this is unique. Due to its surface specificity our technique allows early detection of change that alter the antigenic properties of viruses and thus the effectiveness of vaccines, with the smallest sample quantities. Furthermore, identification without specific antibodies is possible.",

The goal is to characterize the specific virus based on single virial particles. One common technique is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which has simplified and accelerated the detection of pathogens over culturing techniques [2] [3] [4] . In PCR, the nucleic acid-either DNA or RNA-has to be extracted from the specimen first. Next, characteristic viral sequences are amplified employing varying primer sets followed by further molecular analysis [2, 3] . In general, multiple DNA target molecules are necessary for sufficient amplification. The examination of a single virus particle is still challenging. Although PCR technologies are quite powerful, several drawbacks limit the application in microbiological diagnostics. On the one hand, high sensitivity of DNA/RNA amplification makes this process susceptible to contamination that might yield falsepositive results. On the other hand, false-negative results, e.g. due to failed amplification, have to be considered, too [4] . The nature of the PCR process is prone to several disturbing factors that 5 may hamper exponential DNA amplification. The implementation of the quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) in recent years, where fluorescent molecules are added, enables exact quantitation of template DNA [3, 5, 6] .",

After setting a grid of profile lines on the sample, the AFM is coupled to the Raman spectrometer and enhanced Raman spectra are recorded. Such a setup does not need special sample pretreatments or tagging and allows a direct chemical characterization. The same setup also provides topographic imaging of the sample surface in a single experiment. The spatial resolution in TERS is limited by the diameter of the silver particle at the tip, and lately has been pushed down to around 0.5 -1 nm for bio-samples [9, 16, 17] . A not-to-scale setup is sketched in Fig. 1a) . For specific instrumental details the reader is referred to ref. [18] . Depending on the number of acquired data, subsequent multivariate data analysis might be useful for data assessment. In the context of a general tip-enhanced approach of a virus identification, it is important to point out that not only all major components to be expected in viruses (namely DNA / RNA [19] [20] [21] , proteins, lipids and even sugars) have been already detected by TERS. Also, different studies on viruses [22] [23] [24] already proved the feasibility of the concept. In contrast to PCR-related techniques, in TERS a separation of the different components or labeling is not required, and ultimately only a single virion is sufficient for an identification.",

The dimension of the CVB3 virus (Fig. 1c) ) is ten times smaller (20-30 nm), with an icosahedral structure (determined by crystallography), where the RNA is packed in a protein coat (capsid) [27] . Clearly, the different surface components of the viruses yield TERS spectra with information on proteins and lipids for H1N1 (Fig. 1d) ) and protein and RNA for CVB3 (Fig. 1e) ). Again, it is obvious that spectral variability on the virus surface occurs and a larger virus 8 surface area must be considered. Nevertheless, a discrimination of both viruses solely based on the TERS spectra is quite straightforward. The experiment with the full statistical evaluation (multiple maps, different particles, different tips) will be published elsewhere. Here we want to emphasize that the method is potentially able to identify any single virus based on the surface composition. The main challenge is the time required for an assessment, particularly the spectral acquisition time. Interestingly, the necessary AFM topography which is always detected to locate a sample can also provide substantial information for a virus pre-screening, thus considerably limiting the potential candidates for TERS investigations. Another possibility to increase the sensitivity will be introduced in the following section where we combined tip/surface enhanced Raman techniques with FAST CARS.",

Our time-resolved Tip Enhanced Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (TECARS) is an exciting new tool for virus research.
