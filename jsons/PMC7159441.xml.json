The fever may be associated with a skin rash, diarrhea, pulmonary infiltrates, or hepatic dysfunction. Although most cases of ES are self\u2010limiting, some can be prolonged and cause severe symptoms, necessitating the use of corticosteroids. The underlying pathophysiology associated with ES remains poorly understood. Based on the Lewis rat syngeneic and autologous HPCT model,5 ES is generally believed to have arisen due to the interplay between pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)\u20101, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, and interferon (IFN)\u03b3 associated with hematopoietic recovery in a setting with a deficiency of T\nreg cells.",

Twenty (27%) cases of ES occurred in this cohort of patients. However, when we included the eight patients with noninfectious fever whose fever was probably due to ES even though the fever was not associated with any rash, diarrhea, pulmonary infiltrate, or abnormal liver function tests, the incidence of ES went up to 37%. By far, ES was the commonest cause for new fever that occurred after Day +8, being responsible for 67% of all late\u2010onset fevers. ES resulted in significantly longer PT\u2010LOS when compared with those without fever (P = 0.0001; HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.1\u20107.2; Figure 1C).

Furthermore, 47 additional chest X\u2010ray examinations (averaging 1.7/ES patient), and three computer\u2010assisted tomographic scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were carried out among the 28 patients who developed ES.

Identification of biomarkers that can be used to help diagnose ES is highly desirable so that these patients do not have to undergo unnecessary investigations and additional antimicrobial therapy that consequently result in longer PT\u2010LOS and higher transplant costs. Elevation of C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) has been found to be associated with ES.6 However, CRP is highly nonspecific and is also elevated in sepsis, the very complication that requires aggressive antimicrobial therapy in this group of immunocompromised patients. Serum procalcitonin is a robust biomarker for sepsis. Future studies may examine the combination of CRP and procalcitonin in the diagnosis of ES and exclusion of sepsis, so patients with a low procalcitonin that accompanies an elevated CRP be confidently diagnosed ES and be spared the additional investigations and prolonged courses of intravenous antimicrobial therapy for the symptoms associated with ES.",
