Also, samples were collected from quail (N = 4), Bluebird (Sialis, N = 1), and Greenfinch (Chloris chloris, N = 1) for analysis. Respiratory viral pathogens were screened by PCR and positive samples were subjected to virus isolation and genetic identification. Antigenic relatedness of isolated avian influenza (AI) H5 subtype was evaluated using cross-hemagglutination inhibition. Results revealed that the incidence of single virus infections in commercial broilers was 64.1% (25/39), with the highest incidence for ND (33.3%) and H9N2 (20.5%), followed by H5N1 (7.7%) and H5N8 (2.7). Meanwhile, H9N2/ND mixed infection was the most observed case (7.7%). Other mixed infections H5N1/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND/IB, H9N2/IB, and H9N2/ILT were also observed (2.6% each). In commercial layers, H5N1 and ILT were the only detected single infections (18.1% each). Mixed H9N2/ND was the most predominant infection in layers (27.3%). Other mixed infections of H9N2/IB, H5N1/H5N8/H9N2, and H9N2/ND/IB were observed in 3 separate farms (9.1% each). The H5N8 virus was detected in one quail farm and 2 out of 3 wild bird's samples. Partial HA gene sequence analysis showed the clustering of the selected AI H5N8 within the 2.3.4.4 clade, while H5N1 clustered with the clade 2.2.1.2. Interestingly, the H5N8 isolated from chickens possessed 6 amino acids substitutions at HA1 compared to those isolated from wild birds with low antigenic relatedness to AI H5N1 clades 2.2.1 or 2.2.1.2. In conclusion, mixed viral infections were observed in both broiler and layer chickens in Egypt. The detected triple H5N1, H9N2, and H5N8 influenza co-infection raises the concern of potential AI epidemic strain emergence.

For instance, the strain A/chicken/Qalubia/MEVACF33/2017 H5N8 possessed 6 amino acids substitutions (S56I, D88G, A134P, N146K, M175L, G342W) compared to the first detected H5N8 in Egypt (A/Common coot/Egypt/CA285/2016). None of these amino acid changes is in the previously reported important genetic sites, however, their biological properties need to be elucidated. Meanwhile, all the isolated H5N8 viruses retain the preferential binding to \u03b1-2-3-Gal avian-like receptors as indicated by aa 222Q and 224 G at the receptor binding pocket of the HA1 molecule (Kandeil et al., 2017) . The differences between domestic and wild birds H5N8 isolates further support previous reports of separate introductions of HPAI H5N8 viruses in domestic poultry in Egypt (Salaheldin et al., 2018; Yehia et al., 2018) . In Egypt, licensed avian influenza commercial vaccines represent HPAI H5N1 of 2.2.1, 2.2.1.1, and 2.2.1.2 clades.

Nevertheless, field observations indicate that both commercial broiler and layer chickens are not protected by H5N1 vaccination. Thus, the crossreactivities of different H5N1 clades with the isolated H5N8 viruses were analyzed. Antisera raised against inactivated H5N1 viruses belonging to clades 2.2.1 and 2.2.1.2 showed minimal reactivity with H5N8 viruses suggesting poor cross-protection. Though the heterologous protection of H5N1 vaccines against H5N8 challenge was attributed to the antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), it was not clear if the increase of ADCC response would be adequate to protect vaccinated mice against H5N8 virus infection (Park et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 797, "end": 819, "text": "(Kandeil et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 993, "end": 1018, "text": "(Salaheldin et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1038, "text": "Yehia et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1325, "text": "Santos et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1347, "text": "Kandeil et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2036, "text": "(Park et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Though not included in the current study, the role of other factors including immunosuppressive diseases, potential viral interference conditions during mixed infections (Aouini et al., 2018) , and secondary bacterial infections (Chu et al., 2017) in increased pathogenicity of different viruses need to be taken in consideration.
