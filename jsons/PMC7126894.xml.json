Some aptamers exist naturally as ligand-binding elements, but most are generated in vitro and tailored to specific purposes. Aptamer's great advantages; structural flexibility, stability, and high affinity and specificity, and its comparably smaller size (~3 nm) than antibodies (10\u201315 nm) [1], allow to bind more dense cellular epitopes in living cells where the epitopes are natively folded [2]. It demonstrates that the true value of aptamers lies in their superior target recognition. As the aptamers show the better structure recognition on the intracellular epitopes, they have quickly emerged as intracellular targeting agents and intracellular imaging tools. In this review, we discuss from the uptake mechanisms, subcellular localization, and intracellular imaging to therapeutic applications of aptamers in human diseases. We also highlight specific examples of conformational selectivity of aptamers as an emerging new field, along with the future strategies to facilitate the translation of intracellular aptamers.",

However, so far, few studies have investigated the endocytic mechanism of these aptamers. For the possible endocytic mechanisms, there are numerous well defined pathways by which aptamers can be internalized from the surface of cell membranes: clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis [[3], [4], [5]]. But, the uptake of aptamers mainly depends on the function of their target receptors. Based on the published studies, the mechanism of internalization of aptamers can be divided into clathrin-dependent or -independent.",

For the example of clathrin-independent pathway, AS1411 aptamers were well characterized. The G-quadruplex nucleolin DNA aptamers bound to nucleolin which was selectively expressed on the cancer plasma membrane and were internalized into cells [9, 10]. To elucidate the endocytic mechanism of AS1411, DU145 prostate cancer cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D (an actin polymerization inhibitor) and dynasore (a dynamin inhibitor). Because clathrin-mediated endocytosis depends on actin and dynamin function, whereas macropinocytosis and phagocytosis do not. Following this pretreatment, the AS1411 uptake was slightly decreased, suggesting that AS1411 was not internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [11]. But, interestingly, pretreatment with amiloride (AML, a macropinocytosis inhibitor) significantly reduced the uptake of AS1411 in cancer cells. The colocalization of AS1411 with the macropinocytic marker (dextran) was confirmed again by confocal microscopy, showing the consistent results of chemical inhibitors. Therefore, AS1411 seems to be predominantly internalized into cancer cells via macropinocytosis [11].",

The PC3 prostate cancer cells were pretreated with AML, chlorpromazine (CPZ, a clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor), and genistein (GEN, a caveolae- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis inhibitor) [12]. Uptake of AS1411 was significantly inhibited by both AML and CPZ, but neither completely prevented aptamer internalization. It suggests that a mix of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis are used for the endocytosis of AS1411 [12]. On the contrary, GEN had no effect on AS1411 uptake, demonstrating that caveolae- and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis was not involved in endocytosis of AS1411 [12]. Taken together of these two studies, it indicates that the internalization of the nucleolin aptamer AS1411 does not follow the standard pathway and also suggest that the uptake mechanisms may vary on the type of cancer cells (Fig. 1B).",

The co-crystal structures of Spinach-DFHBI revealed an unexpected structure composed of a quadruplex core flanked by two coaxially-stacked A-form duplexes [25]. Typically, G-quadruplexes contain guanines in all of their tetrads. However, the quadruplex element of Spinach exhibited unconventional complex connectivity of two G-tetrads and a mixed-base tetrad [25]. The fluorophore was sandwiched by a base triple and was hemmed in by an unpaired guanine residue (G31). In comparison with the crystal structure of DFHBI-free Spinach, the overall conformation of the aptamer was unchanged, but the fluorophore binding site collapsed with a rearranged base tier of the quadruplex and G31 extruded from the helical stack [25]. As the Spinach showed the thermal instability and misfolding that resulted in reduced brightness [26], new variants of Spinach, such as Spinach2 [26], iSpinch [27], and Baby Spinach [28] have been engineered to overcome these shortcomings for further studies.",

DFHBI-treated E. coli expressing the SAM-Spinach sensor showed the increased fluorescence ~6 fold over 3 h in the presence of the SAM precursor of methionine [30].

The Broccoli was isolated using the combined methods which were the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) approaches. The SELEX was performed in the first round when the RNA pool exhibited fluorescence upon incubation with the fluorophore. After that, the aptamer library was cloned into a bacterial expression plasmid. The library plasmid was transformed into E. coli and in vivo fluorescence was sorted out by FACS in the presence of DFHBI. The characteristics of the Broccoli showed robust folding in low magnesium concentrations, as well as increased thermostability and fluorescence than Spinach2. The Broccoli was engineered to tBroccoli (49 nt) and the dimeric tBroccoli (tdBroccoli) for further in vivo applications. Indeed, the tdBroccoli showed the twice as fluorescence as Broccoli in living E. coli [23]. For the genetic expression of structured RNAs, the tRNA-fused scaffold system is often used to promote the appropriate folding of aptamers in cells [31], because the appropriate structural folding of aptamers is pivotal for the function of aptamers. For the stable folding of aptamers, the tBroccoli or tDBroccoli was fused to the 3\u2032 terminus of 5S expressed from the pAV5S tRNA scaffold plasmid (5S-tBroccoli or 5S-tDBroccoli) for imaging in mammalian HEK293T cells. The 5S-tdBroccoli showed 70% brighter than 5S-tBroccoli in mean fluorescence intensity in transfected HEK293T cells. Moreover, the Broccoli and dBroccoli fused to the 3\u2032 terminus of 5S without tRNA scaffold plasmid showed the higher cellular brightness than 5S fused to tRNA scaffold-aptamer constructs in HEK293T cells. It supports the idea that the tRNA scaffold is selectively necessary depending on the folding efficiency of aptamers for genetically tagged imaging.",

In the molecular structure analysis using the sequence analyses and biochemical probing, the Mango was predicted to fold into two-tiered all-parallel G-quadruplexes connected to an A-form duplex [24]. To reveal the mechanism of fluorescence activation by the Mango, the crystallization of Mango-TO1 complex was determined. The co-crystal structure of Mango-TO1 revealed a three-tiered G-quadruplex that included three antiparallel quinine residues connected to an A-form duplex through a GAAA tetraloop-like junction [32]. The fluorophore bound on one of the flat faces of the G-quadruplex, stabilized the Mango-TO binding for fluorescence. Therefore, the Mango enhanced the fluorescence of the fluorophore up to 1100-fold relative to unbound fluorophore. As the Mango showed the brightest fluorescence among other Spinach and Broccoli fluorogenic aptamers, the feasibility of in vivo imaging was determined in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). To visualize the cellular RNAs with the Mango, TO1 was directly injected into C. elegans syncytial gonads, either with or without RNA Mango. The injection of dye alone showed the negligible fluorescence, but the injection of the Mango resulted in a strong fluorescence, specifically localized to the syncytial nuclei of the gonad [24]. The unbleached bright fluorescence was observed over 2 h after injection within time frame in vivo.",

To get the answer, one study was performed how well these fluorogenic RNA aptamers are tolerated when engineered for structured cellular RNAs [38]. Nine distinct variants of Spinach and Broccoli were inserted at the same position in 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) for comparative studies. Among the nine variants, Baby Spinach and Broccoli yielded superior fluorescence in live-cell imaging of E.\ncoli. However, most variants of Spinach and Broccoli impaired cell growth depending on the sequences and length of the aptamers, showing the toxicity. Hence, the optimization is indispensable. As all of strategies described here enables the design of sensors to image essentially any molecules in living cells, the fluorogenic RNA aptamer tags have diverse applications for imaging of intracellular RNA dynamics (Fig. 3\n). Also, theoretically, RNA aptamers can be readily generated against any biomolecules, new fluorogenic aptamers are expected to be developed.",

The activity of intracellularly expressed TetR aptamers directly correlated with its expression level and stability. The same group, again, isolated inhibitory RNA aptamers against the repressor protein lambda phage cI as a transcriptional activator in E. coli [42]. Upon intracellular aptamer expression, expression of the reporter gene was increased 35-fold. These studies illustrate valuable strategies for the fine regulation of genetic circuits by using synthetic RNA aptamers.",

The DNA aptamer targeting the FOXM1 DBD (FOXM1 Apt) was isolated and phosphorthioate-modified FOXM1 Apt (M-FOXM1 Apt) was constructed to increase its serum stability [48]. Both FOXM1 Apt and M-FOXM1 Apt showed specific binding to FOXM1 proteins and M-FOXM1 Apt improved the binding affinity from 172.1 nM to 63.86 nM. M-FOXM1 Apt localized to the nuclei of cells after transfection. To test the inhibition of transcriptional activities of M-FOXM1 in vitro, gel shift assay was performed. It abolished the binding of FOXM1 on its consensus binding sites at a dose-dependent manner. In biological functional assays, M-FOXM1 Apt significantly inhibited cell proliferation at the 48 h time point after treatment. The treatment of M-FOXM1 Apt dramatically decreased the expression of FOXM1-target genes, such as Cdc25B and Cycline B1, but not FOXM1 in breast cancer cell. It suggests that the inhibitory effects of M-FOXM1 result from disturbing FOXM1 transcriptional activation but not from directly affecting FOXM1 expression [48].",

For the soluble molecular decoys of NF-kB, RNA aptamers was identified against the p50 homodimer form of NF-kB (p502). In vitro assays, the selected anti-NF-kB aptamers competitively inhibited DNA binding by NF-kB [54]. The following studies have been performed to optimize the RNA aptamer for binding to NF-kB [55]. The optimized anti-NF-kB aptamers demonstrated the specific decoy activity, inhibiting transcriptional activation by its NF-kB target protein. In the expression of bivalent of anti-NF-kB p50 aptamers, the decoy activity was enhanced [55]. This study has a strong implication that the expression of therapeutic decoy RNAs have possibility to modulate gene expression. The anti-NF-kB p65 was also isolated by the same group in parallel [56]. The selected anti-NF-kB p65 aptamers had the similar decoys effect in competition assay.

Its genome is 9.2 kb with multiple open reading frames, flanked by a UTR at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends [67]. For the universal anti-viral effects, RNA aptamers have been isolated targeting the first 308 nt of the 5\u2032-UTR, which is highly conserved in HIV-1 [68]. After 14 rounds of selection, the 64-nt length of anti-HIV-1 UTR aptamer was isolated. In the sequence analysis, the hexanucleotides (5\u2032-GGCAAG-3\u2032) within anti-HIV UTR aptamers were found to be complementary to the apical loop of the poly (A) domain in the repeated region (R) located in both the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs of HIV, indicating that the hexanucleotide sequence is a putative binding site. Use of in silico aptamers-target analysis, anti-HIV UTR aptamer was truncated to the 16 nt-long stem-loop RNA aptamers including the hexnucleotides (RNApt16). But, for the function assays, the RNApt16 and unmodified full-length of anti-HIV UTR aptamers did not show any inhibitory effects with transfection. But, chemically synthesized RNApt16 showed inhibitory effects of 85 \u00b1 5%, suggesting that improving the half-life is pivotal. By following studies, the full length anti-HIV UTR aptamers were cloned into a human U6 snRNA cassette, pU614, for stable hairpin-loop domains. HEK293T cells were transfected with the in vitro transcribed anti-HIV UTR aptamers from the U6 plasmid, which inhibited HIV particle production upto 80 \u00b1 7%.",

Pathophysiologically, it involves wound repair [73] and tumorigenesis [74]. Originally, anti-peripstin DNA aptamers developed to inhibit breast cancer growth and metastasis [75]. But, recently accumulated evidence suggests that the high expression of periostin is involved in renal fibrosis through the hyper activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) pathway [76, 77]. Indeed, the accumulation of periostin is associated with progressive renal fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy by the activation of TGF-\u03b21, which is regarded as one of the main mediators of the deleterious effects of diabetic nephropathy [78, 79]. To determine the feasibility of anti-periostin DNA aptamers for the therapeutics for renal fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy, the biological function of anti-periostin DNA aptamers was determined in diabetes mellitus animal model. It showed that anti-periostin DNA aptamers attenuated increased blood urea nitrogen levels and expression of fibronectin and tubule interstitial fibrosis under diabetic conditions in vivo [80], suggesting that anti-periostin DNA aptamers might be a potential therapeutic to treat fibrosis in diabetics.",

The p53R175H mutation abolished the function of the p53 wide type (WT) and confers a gain of anti-apoptotic effects in lung cancer cells [88]. To select p53R175H specific RNA aptamers, contrast screen SELEX was used with WT p53 proteins. RNA aptamers binding to WT p53 was discarded and the RNAs binding to the p53R175H were selectively recovered and amplified. After five round of SELEX, RNA aptamers that bind specifically to p53R175H have been successfully isolated [89]. The specific binding to p53R175H, but not the WT p53 was confirmed by gel shift assays. Further in vitro function assay, intracellular delivery of anti-p53R175H aptamers with nanoparticles did not affect cell growth harboring WT p53 and another type of p53 mutant, p53R273H. But, anti-p53R175H aptamers clearly showed the inhibition of cell growth harboring p53R175H.

Consequently, the nucleolin-\u03b2-arrestin 2 aptamer chimeras inhibited the leukemia cell growth by colony forming assays [93]. The anti-tumor effects were not determined in vivo.",

The recent observation of increased eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) activity in the breast cancer malignancy [97] also prove that mRNAs are most dependent on eIF4A1 activity in cellular transformation, which is making eIF4A an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, RNA aptamers to eIF4A have been characterized using protein-based SELEX methodology [98]. In vitro functional assays, anti-eIF4A showed the inhibition of cap-dependent translation by blocking ATP hydrolysis [98]. In the working mechanism of anti-eIF4A aptamer, it was proposed that anti-eIF4A aptamers inhibited the conformation changes necessary for ATP hydrolysis. Based on the fact that the malignant cells become \u2018addicted\u2019 to the altered translational landscape [99], the selected anti-eIF4A aptamer has a great potential as therapeutics against all type of malignant cancers.",

The majority aptamers show the inhibitory of protein function. Therefore, one intriguing idea was brought up that aptamer/protein complex with verified intracellular functionality was used to develop assays to screen small-molecule libraries [100]. The main concept was to displace the aptamer from its target protein, releasing the fluorescence signals if a small molecule competes with the aptamer/protein interaction. For the high-throughput screening, reporter ribozyme was developed to screen a 96 member sample library of antibiotics for molecules that could disrupt the interaction between HIV Rev and its cognate RNA. If small molecules compete with the binding site of the aptamer/protein complexes, the ribozyme become active and cleaves a substrate labeled with a fluorescence tag and a quencher. In the cleaved state, the two products rapidly dissociate from the ribozyme, resulting in a fluorescence signal. In results, the screen identified one compounds, coumermycin A1, that inhibited the HIV-1 virus replication in cell culture experiments [100]. This proof of concept study well establishes the novel small drug inhibitor screen assays by using interference with aptamer/protein interactions.",

            "text": "Current molecular biology techniques have the limited ability to distinguish the conformational changes of proteins. Aptamer's superior target recognition function allows us to use as a tool to detect the conformation changes of target proteins. Indeed, a very compelling study has been investigated how sophistically aptamers can detect the conformational changes and how it affect the downstream signaling in G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are the seven-\u03b1-helical transmembrane-spanning receptors and over 800 members are identified in the human genome [101]. GPCRs are very popular targets in pharmaceutic industries and one-third of pharmaceutical agents targeting GPCRs are currently available on the market for the treatment of various human diseases [101]. The GPCRs undergo conformational changes that activate intracellular signaling cascades in response to agonist binding. It exhibits conformational heterogeneity in both ligand-occupied and ligand-free states [102, 103]. To take the full advantage of aptamer's high target recognition to detect the conformational change of GPCRs by binding of agonist, a highly diverse RNA library combined with the next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were used to isolated RNA aptamers that bound a prototypical GPCR, the \u03b22-adrenoceptor (\u03b22AR) [104]. For the SELEX, \u03b22AR proteins were produced by baculovirus-mediated expression in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) insect cells. To keep the active conformation state of \u03b22AR for selection of RNA aptamers, an agonist of BI167107 was used. In results, several aptamers were grouped into three categories: 1) conformational selective aptamers (A1, A2, and A13) for the active form of the \u03b22AR on the BI167107-bound; 2) binding specific aptamers (A15 and A16) for inactive form of the \u03b22AR; 3) clear selective aptamers (A11) binding to both unoccupied and BI167107-bound forms of the \u03b22AR [104]. For further characterization, the modulation of transitions between active and inactive conformation as well as the stabilization of the ligand-specific conformation was explored using agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists. Comparing with the control, aptamers A1 and A13 robustly bound to agonist-occupied \u03b22AR which was correlated with agonist efficacy, and this binding was markedly reduced in the presence of antagonists. But, interestingly, the A2 aptamer did not correlate with ligand efficacy. To investing the working mechanism, the receptor pulldown assay with BI167107-occupied \u03b22AR was performed. Surprisingly, the aptamer A2 displayed a unique selectivity toward a \u03b22AR conformation stabilized by inverse agonists, suggesting that the aptamer A2 stabilizes a unique active conformation of the \u03b22AR that is distinct from that stabilized by aptamers A1 and A13. To investigate the ability of aptamers to stabilize active \u03b22AR conformations, the fluorescence spectroscopic studies (that is, the decreased fluorescence intensity upon the conformational changes) were performed with a \u03b22AR labeled with a bimane probe. The results showed the enhanced effects of A1, A2, and A13 (that is, a further decrease in fluorescence intensity) when they were combined with full agonist, signifying further stabilization of active conformations by aptamers. To investigate the binding epitopes and structure basis of the interactions, negative stain electron microscopy (EM) and single-particle reconstruction analysis was utilized. The visualization of aptamer-\u03b22AR complex showed that A16 appeared to interact with the extracellular region of the receptor. On the contrary, the A1, A2, and A13 bound at the intracellular region of the \u03b22AR, suggesting that binding of the aptamers to the active state of \u03b22AR inhibited the receptor in the presence of an agonist by engaging an allosteric mechanism [104] (Fig. 4A). It indicates the aptamers might be used allosteric inhibiters. There was reported no relationship between binding affinity and the functional effects on \u03b22AR aptamers. This study supports the idea that the binding site of the aptamer on targets, and not binding affinity, is important for functional effects.",

The different homodimer and heterodimer compositions of Jun and Fos show promoter-specific differences in transcription activation [108]. These AP-1 dimers regulate in variable cellular pathways including cell proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis [109]. However, current molecular biology techniques are unable to distinguish the difference between the roles of cJun/cJun homodimers versus cJun/cFos heterodimers. To build the foundation to investigate the different AP-1 dimer compositions, DNA aptamers have been isolated using the cJun homodimer protein based SELEX [110]. The binding specificity of DNA aptamers to homodimers of cJun/cJun, but not to cJun/cFos heterodimers was confirmed with the gel shift assays. In competition assay, the anti-cJun aptamer blocked the homodimerization of cJun from binding AP-1 DNA. The cJun homodimers are not only capable of binding cis-elements on DNA to activate transcription but can also function as transcriptional co-activators by binding directly to other transcription factors NFATc2 for synergistic activation of interleukin 2 (IL-2) [111]. Therefore to determine the biological function of anti-cJun homodimer DNA aptamers, the transcriptional inhibition of IL-2 was assayed. The anti-cJun dimer aptamer repressed the expression of IL-2 in luciferase assay [110] (Fig. 4B).",

            "text": "The specificity of aptamers reflects the arrangement of loops and stems and the hydrogen bonds that stabilize their three-dimensional structures. The structural stability of aptamers relies on a core formed by a stacked G-quadruplex. G-quadruplexes are guanine-rich sequences with extremely stable secondary structures. G-quadruplexes are formed when guanines are organized into planar quartets in which each base is connected to two other bases via Hoogsteen base pairing. Hydrogen bonds between each pair of guanines involve four donor/acceptor atoms, so G-quadruplexes have eight hydrogen bonds in total [112]. However, in some cases, very stable G-quadruplex aptamers have shown cross-binding to several different proteins. For example, the 16-mer G-quadruplex DNA aptamer binds HIV-integrase, interleukin-6, and HIV-gp120 [113, 114]. The G-quadruplex RNA aptamers showed cross-binding to VEGF165, PDGF-AA, and PDGF-BB [115]. The structural stability of aptamers, mainly via G-quadruplex formation, is very important, but it may reduce the specificity of aptamers in some cases. Thus, the G-quadruplex required for aptamer stability has been considered a double-edged sword.",

To avoid the immune stimulation, numerous types of non-natural chemical modifications have been developed for the functional diversity of DNAs, xenonucleic acid (XNA, artificial genetic polymers) [117], and RNAs [118]. Currently, widely used chemical modification in RNA aptamers are 2\u2032O-methyl (2\u2032OMe) and 2\u2032Fluoro (2\u2032F). To investigate the immune responses of chemically-modified RNA aptamers in vitro level, 2\u2032OMe and 2\u2032F nucleotides were incorporated into RNA aptamers. The 2\u2032F modification abrogated the stimulation of toll-like receptors 3 and 7, but enhanced the activity of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 [119]. The 2\u2032F modification with 5\u2032 triphosphate (5\u2032ppp) increased cell death and interferon-\u03b2 expression in human cancer cells compared with 2\u2032 hydroxyl with 5\u2032ppp, whereas chemically synthesized 2\u2032F RNA aptamers without 5\u2032ppp did not. Interestingly, replacement of 2\u2032F with 2\u2032OMe in 5\u2032ppp RNA aptamers completely abolished the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the main immune response of RNA aptamers is due to 5\u2032ppp. [119].",

The main endocytic mechanisms of aptamers are categorized into the clathrin-dependent or \u2013independent, depending on the type of targets or cells. The variations of intracellular distributions are also observed depending on the type of cells. Upon the binding of aptamers to their intracellular targets, antagonistic aptamers induce the alternation of intracellular distribution of their targets and the inhibition of biological functions, suggesting the potential of intracellular therapeutic applications. Indeed, there have been exciting improvements in intracellular aptamer, intramer, development; gene regulating aptamers, anti-TF aptamers for therapeutics, and conformation specific aptamers for allosteric inhibitors in cancers. However, in spite of great achievement of therapeutic intramers, the translation to the clinic is very slow. Hence, to facilitate the successful translation of therapeutic intramers, the few strategies have been considered.",

For biological activity, the aptamers must reach the cytosol, escaping the endosome. When the aptamers are endocytosed via a receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent mechanism, the rate of access to the cytosol mainly depends on the expression of receptors, the rates of receptor recycling, and endosomal escape efficiency. Typically, a small percentage (<0.01%) of endocytosed nucleic acid-based therapeutics are able to escape the endosome [122]. Hence, the facilitating of endosomal escape is pivotal to increase the efficacy of therapeutic intramers. For improving the endosomal escape, currently available endosomal escaping aids are small-molecule endosomolytic agents, such as chloroquine. An emerging alternative to improve endosomal escape is to conjugate endosomolytic peptides directly to the RNA molecules [122]. For example, anti-PMSA aptamer-siRNA chimeras were conjugated to pH-dependent polyhistidine (His) [123]. The His18 tag was shown to be remarkably effective in endosomal destabilization and improved the gene silencing effects of the chimera [123] (Fig. 5\n). Thus, conjugation of aptamers with tissue-penetrating or endosomal escaping peptides will facilitate the translation of therapeutic intramers to the clinic.",
