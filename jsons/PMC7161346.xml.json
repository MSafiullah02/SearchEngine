We are witnessing stories of human suffering, including overwhelmed health-care systems, limited access to emergency care, vacationing passengers stranded on cruise ships, large-scale evacuations, overnight economic shutdown, and empty streets in China and Italy.[123] The imagery is comparable to an epic movie depicting martial law with large populations confined to their homes in the wake of a deadly virus. This time, it is a novel coronavirus, and the associated disease has been named COVID-19. Moreover, the current world-wide event has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).[45]",

In an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government has implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and several nearby cities, effectively forcing millions of people to remain indoors and avoid unnecessary outdoor travel.[8] In a record period of 10 days, a massive 1000-bed hospital was built to help cope with the rapidly increasing number of cases.[9]",

Cases linked to travel to/from Iran have been found in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, and Oman. Similarly, cases related to Italy have been found in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland.[513] Most recently, Nigeria confirmed its first case in Sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the US reported its first coronavirus-related death in Washington state.[1415] Thus, COVID-19 has established itself outside of China and now appears to be spreading across new regions, countries, and continents. The geographic diversity of the above locations suggested that a pandemic was imminent and ultimately, on 11th of March, 2020 WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.[516] In the meanwhile, various international and regional authorities are following the footsteps of China to impose movement restrictions on their populations with an aim to curb the human-to-human spread of the virus.",

Other provinces in China have not shown similar massive increase in infections and deaths as seen in the Hubei province. However, this was achieved at a great cost for the 40\u201360 million residents of Wuhan and 15 other surrounding cities within Hubei Province who were subjected to community containment measures.[1320] The human movement restrictions may be prolonged for now as approximately 14% of recovered coronavirus patients in China's Guangdong have tested positive again after being declared virus free and there is no consensus on the optimal length of the quarantine.[21]",

Technological advances provide humanity with new, previously unavailable options. Although the ultimate solution to the COVID-19 infection will be multifaceted, one important avenue that has not yet been explored fully is to leverage existing technologies to facilitate optimal care delivery while minimizing the risk of direct human-to-human exposure. In this context, telemedicine represents an attractive, effective, and affordable option. Moreover, this technology is of critical importance when one considers the consequences of health-care providers contracting COVID-19 as a result of direct exposure; something that can be especially devastating in low-resource areas or under the circumstances of massive stress to the existing health-care infrastructure and staff.[22]",

Under such conditions, telemedicine services (TMSs) become a critical asset, with important implications across the entire health-care delivery spectrum. The use of TMS offers several advantages, especially in the setting of nonurgent/routine care and in situations where services do not require direct provider\u2013patient interaction, such as focused/abbreviated medical consultations or mental health visits.[262728] This, in turn, reduces resource use across the already stressed health-care infrastructure, improves access to care, and at the same time minimizes the risk of direct person-to-person transmission of the infectious agent.[29303132] Furthermore, the associated reduction in resource consumption due to the lower need for personal protective equipment can amount to substantial financial savings when considered at national, continental, or global scale.[3334]",

In addition to TMS being beneficial by keeping unaffected individuals safe, including the general public, patients and health workers, another crucial advantage is its ability to provide a powerful \u201cforce multiplier\u201d that dramatically extends the reach of caregivers. Medical professionals such as triage nurses and emergency medical technicians can quickly screen larger numbers of patients and lessen the burden on physicians and specialists who can perform remote consults when needed.",
