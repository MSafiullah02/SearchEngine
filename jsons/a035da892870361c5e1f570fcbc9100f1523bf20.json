Although feline viral diseases can pose serious health hazards to pet cats, commercialized preventative vaccines are lacking. Interferons (IFNs), especially type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and interferon omega (IFN-\u03c9)), have been explored as effective therapeutic drugs against viral diseases in cats. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge regarding feline IFN-\u03c9 (feIFN-\u03c9), compared to IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. In this study, we cloned the genes encoding feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b from cat spleen lymphocytes. Homology and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these two genes belonged to new subtypes of feIFN-\u03c9.

We know of a wide variety of viral infections that can seriously endanger the health of pet cats, such as FeLV, FIV, FIPV, FCoV, and feline calicivirus (FCV). Interferon represents a promising potential therapeutic agent that can effectively treat pet cats infected with these viruses. In this study, we identified two new genes encoding feline IFN-\u03c9 (feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b) in the spleen lymphocytes of cats. Following sequence homology analysis, we found that feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b shared maximum nucleotide sequence homologies of 91.88% and 90.20%, and maximum amino acid homologies of 91.6% and 89.4% with the 13 previously published subtypes of feline IFN-\u03c9, respectively. In addition, phylogenetic tree analysis of IFNs in cats and other species constructed using neighbor-joining analysis revealed that feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b do belong to the type I IFN family, but their evolutionary relationship to known feline IFN-\u03c9 genes was distant, indicating that feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b were indeed new subtypes of feline IFN-\u03c9. We deposited these two genes into the GenBank with the accession numbers MK682680 (feIFN-\u03c9a) and MK682681 (feIFN-\u03c9b), thus enriching the IFN-\u03c9 data submitted to the GenBank [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1279, "end": 1283, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, the characteristics of the feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b proteins, such as signal peptide sequences, signal peptide cleavage sites, phosphorylation sites, glycosylation sites, antigen epitopes, hydrophobicity, and transmembrane regions were analyzed using bioinformatics to provide better theoretical guidance for the functional study of these proteins. The mature proteins, with normal biological activity, were formed only after the signal peptide sequence was removed from the precursor protein, thus allowing them to be secreted outside the cell membrane [28, 29] . We used online software to predict that the signal peptide sequence of the feIFN-\u03c9a/\u03c9b proteins consists of 23 amino acid residues, and that the signal peptide cleavage site is located between residues Gly23 and Cys24. The results indicated that the recombinant feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b proteins could be expressed in vitro in their soluble forms. Glycosylation is an important post-translational modification process that can affect the antigenic determinants, charge properties, enzymatic properties, and thermal stability of proteins. Similar to previous reports for the 13 known feIFN-\u03c9 subtypes [12] , we observed no N-glycosylation sites present in feIFN-\u03c9a or feIFN-\u03c9b. However, our analyses predicted nine potential O-glycosylation sites in feIFN-\u03c9a and six potential O-glycosylation sites in feIFN-\u03c9b, which is different from previous reports on the other known IFN-\u03c9 subtypes [6] . Studies have shown that glycosylation sites can play an important role in determining the activity of IFNs [30, 31] . For example, glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 has been observed to be markedly more potent than non-glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 against hepatitis C virus, BVDV, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus, with even more superior effects than IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 [6, 30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 566, "end": 570, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 571, "end": 574, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1178, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1463, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1577, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1581, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1827, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1831, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Insect/baculovirus expression systems are one of the most effective eukaryotic expression systems for preparing feline IFNs. These expression systems are capable of making post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which allows proteins to fold correctly, thus producing highly active and stable IFNs [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . However, the application of these systems is limited by drawbacks, such as low yield of IFN protein and complicated operation requirements [37] . Therefore, E. coli expression systems are still the most widely used prokaryotic expression system for protein production with their characteristics of simple procedures, large-scale production, and low cost [38] [39] [40] . Generally, recombinant IFN is produced by E. coli expression systems in an insoluble inclusion body form that has not been modified or folded correctly, resulting in the loss of its biological activity [41, 42] . To obtain a soluble and biologically active IFN protein, the inclusion bodies need to be denatured and then renatured, which is a time-consuming, laborious process [40] . In this study, we selected the prokaryotic soluble expression system pCold-TF to prepare recombinant feIFN-\u03c9a and feIFN-\u03c9b. The pCold-TF system is a highly efficient soluble expression system with a His-tagged TF that allows the expressed protein to be effectively modified, folded, and secreted into the cytoplasm [43, 44] . Following the construction of recombinant E. coli strains and induction by IPTG, the rfeIFN-\u03c9a/\u03c9b proteins were expressed in their soluble forms and analyzed via SDS-PAGE.
