The oncology ward contains 14 single patient rooms and an open access multipurpose room where patients and visitors can prepare meals and socialize. There is a single point of entry without direct access to other units so as to prevent through traffic. Transportation of patients to and from other locations in the hospital is limited. However, HCWs often disperse to other locations in the hospital (ie, other units, outpatient clinics, and administrative offices), and patient visitors are not limited. At the time an outbreak was identified, 10 of 14 beds on the ward were occupied. Although the exact number of all HCWs with some exposure to the ward remains uncertain, we were able to confirm 39 nurses were assigned to the unit during the outbreak period of interest, November 14, 2017, to November 27, 2017 (2 days prior to the first patient case until the last day admissions were diverted).",

The last diagnosis of influenza A in an inpatient was on November 19, 2017. Unfortunately, an attack rate among the staff cannot be reliably calculated, because the exact number of all exposed HCWs in this outbreak is difficult to quantify owing to the frequency of visits from outside personnel (ie, pharmacists, social workers, chaplains, and consultants). Identification of influenza cases in HCWs who work in various locations throughout the hospital resulted in an exponential number of staff with potential exposure (ie, office mates and outpatient clinic staff), all of whom could not be accurately accounted for. Prophylactic oseltamivir was prescribed to 108 persons during the outbreak period, which we suspect exceeds the number of truly exposed persons, but also reflects the diversity of the staff involved. However, we were able to confirm 39 nurses were assigned to the ward between the dates of November 14, 2017 and November 27, 2017 (2 days prior to the first inpatient case through the end of the outbreak).
