Wicked problems come in various forms but a significant contemporary wicked problem for policy makers concerns how to manage disease threats at the animal\u2010human interface. Managing such diseases is a complex process that is underpinned by uncertainty, high risk and requires governmental resilience (Brassett et al., 2013). The failure to effectively manage the wicked problem of disease\u2010induced crises can result in major costs for society (Connolly, 2015; 2016; Geuijen et al., 2016; Head, 2008; Weber and Khademian, 2008). The UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) have highlighted the significant societal costs which emerge from the outbreaks of animal diseases (which interface with public health):Zoonoses are diseases capable of passing from animals to humans and are estimated to have cost more than $20 billion in direct costs globally between 2000\u20132010, with a further $200 billion in indirect costs. As well as threatening human and animal health, zoonoses affect livestock production, causing economic and social harm to communities in developed and developing countries. (ESRC, 2014)\n\n",

Managing zoonoses is one of the most pressing and complex challenges for modern risk governance given they have acute social, environmental, political and economic implications but they are also shaped by different policy styles across state contexts (Baekkeskov, 2016; Kuetting and Cerny, 2015). The added challenge is that detection has not been the main focus of disease containment strategies as well as the absence of a long\u2010term and global political commitment for dealing with the \u2018causes of the causes\u2019 of outbreaks (e.g. poor sanitation, habitation, poverty and societal inequalities) (Marmot, 2005). The risks of transboundary disease\u2010induced crises also needs to be seen in the context of globalisation. The continued interconnectivity of peoples, goods and services increase levels of vulnerability that diseases will spread (Harrison, 2015; Huynen et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2016).",

Yet a major barrier to reaching integrated public policy for health security is that respective knowledge networks are not sufficiently integrated. The Chair of Public Health England (and distinguished Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and former Assistant Director\u2010General of the Health Security and the Environment of the WHO), David Heymann, summarises this issue:\nThe areas of animal and human security policy, and their knowledge networks, are by no means joined\u2010up. Stakeholder interests are divergent and the areas suffer from asynchronous political visions \u2026 The difficulty is that animal health is to keep animals healthy but the ultimate goal is a profit whereas human health is to keep people alive and healthy. So already there are tensions between the two groups and if you want to sell anything to the animal health community it has to be different to how you sell something to the human health community.

The contribution that this article makes to the academic debate is the development of a conceptual framework for evidencing the level of policy maturity towards a One Health model of health security governance from an epistemic perspective. The relationship between knowledge integration, epistemic communities and health security governance has (to date) not been sufficiently examined. Despite a lack of strategic integration at an institutional level in global health governance, it is clear from some studies (e.g. Leboeuf, 2011; Lee and Brumme, 2013) that there have been shifts in global discourses that indicate a recognition for the need to embed a One Health policy model between the \u2018tripartite\u2019 of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). A One Health model could, however, be said to be rather utopian but this does not mean that greater integration across policy sectors is not a pragmatic way forward. Geuijen et al. (2016), in their examination of the public value in global wicked problems (specifically forced migration), call for institutional innovation, and collective discourses, global/transnational connections in order to reframe and address issues of a global concern. Geuijen et al. (2016, p. 6) launch a pre\u2010emptive strike against critics who might judge that innovating to solve wicked problems is a \u2018motherhood and apple pie\u2019 issue by noting that \u2018[o]ne can scoff at this analysis and claim that it is simply too simplistic\u2019 given that actors tend to function within their own operating environments. The issue of One Health is similar in the sense that the animal and public health professional communities need to make in\u2010roads towards addressing diseases at the animal\u2010human interface and to shape public policy. The article offers a policy analysis of the problematics associated with epistemic integration in the context of global governance \u2013 although the dominant policy domains are naturally immersed in health science studies and this will be clear throughout. In short, this article proposes an evaluative framework for establishing the level of maturity in the emergence and impact of epistemic integration towards a One Health model in context of contemporary health security governance.",

A key problem is that there has not been the development of a conceptual framework for establishing the extent of progress that has been made towards this model \u2013 despite senior and influential policy actors calling for knowledge to be joined\u2010up across policy areas in order to best mitigate against health security threats (Heymann, 2014). An \u2018epistemic community\u2019 of cross\u2010policy actors (bridging animal and public health security) would be the most significant force for influencing the policy agenda in order to prevent and detect against the manifestation of disease outbreaks. Such a development would serve to increase public health capacities to tackle animal health\u2010induced crises affecting the human population (Zinsstag et al., 2011). It would also give much more prominence to integrative conceptual empirical development in health security governance. Lee and Brumme (2013, p. 778) notes that the One Health approach \u2018has received growing attention over the past decade amongst policy\u2010makers, practitioners and funders seeking more effective prevention, control and treatment responses in an increasingly populous and globalised world\u2019. As the extract from the interview with Heymann earlier in the article highlighted, stakeholder interests within the public and animal health sectors are divergent and these respective domains suffer from a lack of knowledge integration and cohesive political visioning. Further challenges include greater enthusiasm in the animal health community for the concept of a One Health model compared to the public health community; the elasticity of the definition of \u2018One Health\u2019 i.e. the lack of indicators for establishing that it has been achieved; the fragmentation and proliferation of institutions in global governance for health; the challenges of managing international policy relationships (between states and between states and international agencies/organisations); the politics of territorial governance; and capacities and concerns for state sovereignty (in terms of sharing data and information between and with supranational bodies) (Connolly, 2015; 2016; Davies et al., 2015; Gibbs, 2014; Lee and Brumme, 2013). Compounded with this is that the global health environment can be described as \u2018overpopulated, fragmented and competitive\u2019 (Zinsstag et al., 2011, p. 148).",

Baum et al. (2017) reflect on \u2018the effectiveness of One Health?\u2019 \u2013 particularly in terms of whether there are adequate metrics for assessing its levels of efficiencies and call for the need for evaluation. Indeed, specific evaluation activities are underway via the EU funded Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH), which include a series of evaluation case studies from a range of territorial/geographic contexts on this basis that these will contribute generating \u2018rigorous evidence that would motivate enablers (policy makers, public sector, development programmes) and value chain actors to apply methods at the relevant scale\u2019 (NEOH).2 At a meta\u2010evaluation level, however, the analysis of One Health needs to be multi\u2010sphered in that evaluation frameworks are required for assessing the global impacts of joint vaccination campaigns, joint surveillance systems, information exchanges between communities and policy makers, capacity building on monitoring activities, and the effectiveness of the tripartite partnership between the WHO, FAO and OIE (i.e. the collaboration and coordination of global activities and integration of control systems). There is clearly a need for specific evaluation studies of One Health initiatives nationally, transnationally and globally but, equally, evaluative for establishing the emergence, forms and impact of epistemic integration towards a One Health model in context of contemporary health security governance are required in order to understand global knowledge integration.",

            "text": "The topic of integration at an organisation/institutional level in public administration research has generally been couched in debates about the challenges of achieving \u2018joined\u2010up government\u2019. Similar to \u2018One Health\u2019 itself, there is an undercurrent of utopianism within the joined\u2010up government literature in that tight integration \u2018must be a good thing\u2019 in symbolic terms but, in fact, it is not without institutional and professional barriers/challenges. The problems of not joining\u2010up may produce political value conflicts (Davies, 2009), more opportunities for bureau\u2010politics (Rosenthal and Kouzmin, 1991); lack of clarity of ownership and confused lines of accountability (Wilkins, 2002), and limited preparedness innovate, challenge convention and work in new ways \u2013 both in an intra\u2010 and inter organisational sense (Clarke and Stewart, 1997). The (perhaps unintended) outcome of \u2018too much\u2019 joined\u2010up government may lead to the dampening of the possibilities for creativity, which can be borne out of a moderately conflictual and competitive environment. More broadly, Ling (2002) notes that aspects of joined\u2010up government entail shifts in governing arrangements that include new accountabilities and incentives (e.g. shared outcome targets); new ways of working across organisational boundaries (including shared leadership and budgeting processes); new ways of delivering services (e.g. joint delivery across sectors and greater scope for consultation with the end user); and new types of organisation (e.g. information sharing, shared cultures and capacity building). The One Health model can learn much from the joined\u2010up government debates but especially in terms of how to network\u2010building and knowledge integration within and around such networks.

Wicked problems are, from a public policy perspective, unstructured, relentless and cross\u2010cutting (Weber and Khademian, 2008). Such characteristics are associated with matters of health security in the sense that the \u2018complexities of disease threats and their transcendence of systems require trade\u2010offs, flexibility, resource\u2010sharing and collaboration\u2019 (Connolly 2015, p. 370). Perspectives on \u2018joined\u2010up thinking\u2019 to tackle wicked problems has been a feature of the social policy and education literature (e.g. Allen, 2003; Frost, 2005) but less of a focus elsewhere. Frost (2005) highlights the ways to enable joined\u2010up thinking across policy sectors:\nShare information between agencies.Complement rather than duplicate.Coordinate and achieve continuity through a single information channel.Taking responsibility.Coordinate spending and resourcing to deal with the problem.Co\u2010locate agencies or strategise to bring knowledge together across geographical boundaries.Use knowledge as part of a participative planning process that is outcome rather than objective\u2010orientated.\n\n(adapted from Frost, 2005, pp. 17\u201318)\n\n",

In terms of national and global levels, scholars have considered the importance of global knowledge networks in generating coherence in public policy and for stimulating policy learning and change (Demeritt et al., 2015; Parsons, 2004; Stone, 2004; 2008). The role of knowledge in public policy research has also associated with lesson\u2010drawing, policy transfer, policy diffusion and policy convergence (Bennett and Howlett, 1992; Dolowitz and Marsh, 2000; Nicholson\u2010Crotty and Carley, 2016; Rose, 1991; Stone, 2012). In this respect, networks of actors are key channels through which learning and change take place. However, less attention has been given to the integration of knowledge between professional or epistemic domains. In terms of knowledge networks, epistemic community research has made the most advances when it comes to considering how networks of expert actors come together in an attempt organise themselves to encourage policy makers to learn from their knowledge (see for example, Adler and Haas, 1992; Dunlop, 2014; Galbreath and McEvoy, 2013; Haas, 1992; 2016; Howorth, 2004; Radaelli, 1997; Richardson, 1996; Zito 2001). An epistemic community is \u2018understood as a network of professionals with competence in a policy area on the basis of a shared objective to ameliorate a political problem via the implementation of an agreed measure\u2019 (Galbreath and McEvoy 2013: 170). According to Haas (1992: 3) epistemic communities possess key elements:They have {1} a shared set of normative and political beliefs, which provide a value\u2010based rationale for the social action of community members; {2} shared causal beliefs, which are derived from their practices leading or contributing to a central set of problems in their domain and which then serve as the basis for elucidating the multiple linkages between possible policy actions and desired outcomes; {3} shared notions of validity \u2013 that is, intersubjective, internally defined criteria for weighting and validating knowledge in the domain of their expertise; and {4} a common policy enterprise \u2013 that is, a set of common practices associated with a set of problems to which their professional competence is directed, presumably out of the conviction that human welfare will be enhanced as a consequence.\n",

Criticisms largely refer to the fact that, in the end, governmental agendas will dominate \u2013 not knowledge. However, this argument could be made about many areas of public policy where actors seek to influence governmental agendas. Studies across the public policy and administration discipline, for example, the politics of evaluation, the politics of expertise, the politics of contingencies and crisis management, policy networks, interest group mobilisation, evidence\u2010based policy making (to name a few) all recognise the influence, and often dominance, of political ideology, preferences and power in limiting translation of knowledge into governmental action (Connolly, 2015; Sabatier, 1987; Sanderson, 2002; Weiss, 1999; Zito, 2001).

Equally, there has been a lack of research that considers knowledge collaborations between discipline areas, and particularly so within health governance (Valeix et al., 2016). As Leboeuf (2011) and Lee and Brumme (2013) have argued, the benefit of a shift in health security governance towards a \u2018One Health\u2019 model is to avoid the dangers of policy makers taking piecemeal approaches and to tackle significant threats of the transmissibility of diseases between animals and humans. After all, SARS, pandemic influenza, avian influenza and Ebola, have all had public health implications but their origin have been in animal infections. For example, the most likely explanation for the 2003 SARS outbreak was that the infection came from a civet (\u2018toddy cat\u2019) that was the carrier of the coronavirus in a live animal market in a province in South China (Heymann and Dixon, 2013). The 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, also referred to as \u2018swine flu\u2019, also had animal health origins in that the virus was a new strain of H1N1 as a result of a triple re\u2010assortment of bird, swine and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus (Trifonov et al. 2009). Avian influenza (particularly the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain), which spread worldwide in 2005, proved to have public health implications (Thorson and Ekdahl, 2005). The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was most likely due to the exposure to bat roost and the 2016 outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil was found to be transferred to humans via Aedes mosquitoes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). There is, therefore, no shortage of evidence to suggest that the sources of disease that threaten large scale outbreaks, and risk public health on a global scale, emerge from infections in animals.

It has been said, and it is a fair argument, that there are elements of vagueness of what joined\u2010up thinking across domains might constitute (Dunleavy, 2010) but this necessitates policy researchers to provide frameworks and indicators for making judgements about levels of effectiveness, successes, and failure in public policy. The critical task, in this regard, is to identify how integrative outcomes are being assessed. For epistemic communities, innovation, diffusion, selection, persistence and policy learning are outcomes for determining whether a One Health epistemic community is present. If evidence of knowledge integration is present across these outcomes then this allows for plausible claims to be made about the extent of progress towards One Health. In this respect, Table 2 provides a One Health evaluation framework and the indicators enable an assessment of knowledge integration including an assessment of the shaping of global policy on health security. The content of Table 2 brings into focus the fact that actors from both public and animal health communities need to have the ability to become advocates while, at the same time, have sufficient insider status in order to influence the policy agenda. Moreover, key criterion for success is whether politicians use One Health groups as a \u2018legimating device\u2019 as part of their policy discourse in order to justify policy actions. To this end, Bardosh (2016, p. 206) suggests that a \u2018social\u2010political movement\u2019 is required:",

As positive as these examples may be they remain regionally\u2010focused. There are opportunities for the WHO to shape its organisational identity in order to become one that is more of a \u2018network\u2010builder\u2019 for One Health and to shape global policy responses. A key starting point is to embed One Health within professional education and training and through funded research collaborations. As Galaz et al. (2015, p. 14) argue, based on interviews with medics and veterinarians within the US Centers for Disease Control to investigate the political economy of One Health, such collaborations are essential in order to address the \u2018legacies of each profession\u2019, which result in different power relations and professional hierarchies. For One Health to be successful there needs to be a breaking down of the barriers between professional identities and address, as Galaz et al. (2015, p. 14) report it, \u2018medics feeling superior to vets and vets feeling inferior to medics\u2019. In other words, university degree level, professional/postgraduate training, and \u2018bottom\u2010up\u2019 research collaboration would support knowledge integration. This will not, however, necessarily address the institutionalised nature of senior policy roles and professional discourses within ministries/civil service departments, at least within the short\u2010term. Senior veterinary officials who can be key architects of government policy tend to have traditional veterinary medicine backgrounds without significant backgrounds in the public health dimensions of animal diseases or epidemiology (Connolly, 2015; Galaz et al., 2015). Success, in the shorter to medium\u2010term (based on a 5 to 10 year trajectory) can be defined by the partial integration within and across outcome domains at sub\u2010national and national levels. The formation of new expert networks at national levels will, through time, emerge as important actors operating internationally to address \u2018problems of global concern\u2019 (Haas, 1992a, p. 1). Indeed, there is considerable potential for an epistemic community to emerge as a result of the One Health \u2018Initiative\u2019, which describes itself as a transnational and cross\u2010disciplinary \u2018movement\u2019 (One Health, 2016):The One Health Initiative is a movement to forge co\u2010equal, all\u2010inclusive collaborations between physicians, osteopathic physicians, veterinarians, dentists, nurses and other scientific\u2010health and environmentally related disciplines, including the American Medical Association, American Veterinary Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Nurses Association, American Association of Public Health Physicians, the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the US National Environmental Health Association (NEHA). Additionally, more than 850 prominent scientists, physicians and veterinarians worldwide have endorsed the initiative. (One Health, 2016)\n\n",

The global initiative is also supported by investments by major philanthropy organisations. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have recognised the need for the human and animal health disciplines to address their \u2018distinctly separate with very little cross\u2010sharing of the knowledge\u2019 and refer to this as a \u2018Global Grand Challenge\u2019 (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 2016).

At a governmental level, the UK Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group is a significant network that draws public and animal health experts together. HAIRS is chaired by Public Health England and is a multi\u2010agency and cross\u2010disciplinary group. The group has sought to identify infections with potential for interspecies transfer (UK Government, 2016). The partners within HAIRS include all of the devolved administrations and major public health agencies \u2010 for example, the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Food Standards Agency. The contribution that this network will make to the establishment of a One Health epistemic community in the longer term, coupled with assessing the outcomes of UK Research Council funded projects, is an important aspect of future research for investigating whether this network has had influence at domestic and international levels of governance. With further network integration there is likely to be technocratic conflict but, as Waltner\u2010Toews (2017) notes in his discussion of technocratic \u2018constructive conflict\u2019, the problem is not necessarily the presence of conflict itself but the priority should be to focus on the approaches and processes for facilitating and managing conflict so that multiple perspectives and policy narratives can be accommodated.",

It is the case that health security governance is a EU policy priority and this has been evidenced by the strengthened health governance policy remit of the European Commission \u2013 a direct lesson learned from the 2009 swine flu pandemic (Connolly, 2014). National public and animal health actors interact with international counterparts in a number of forums such as Health Security Committee (of the European Commission), the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), and the WHO. The European Health Security Committee, a key policy committee of the European Commission, has been incrementally strengthened since the SARS outbreak 2002\u201303 and it saw its role becoming more formal in the aftermath of pandemic influenza in 2009. The current chair of this committee, John Ryan, suggested in the recent past that a strengthened European Security Committee (ESC) ensures that national level data is shared and national authorities are held to account for their planning activities:Having a more formal role for the ESC was popular after the pandemic because the member states realised that continuing in a more informal, limited way in terms of just coordinating in terms of communicating diseases as we did before was inadequate because many of the aspects relating to communicable diseases and large scale events are cross\u2010sectoral.

However, diseases are not mindful to support the results of national referenda on leaving political and socio\u2010economic blocs, therefore it is in the interests of territories to continue collaboration on health security within a multi\u2010level and globalised system of governance. At the same time, David Heymann argues that matters of technical public policy relating to health security (e.g. information and data sharing arrangements with supranational bodies) are not devoid of questions about national sovereignty and these can serve to impede knowledge integration. It is not beyond the realms of impossibility that Brexit may serve to politically inhibit global epistemic cooperation for health security governance, or at least result in the reconfiguration of policy relationships. Even before the Brexit result was on the political table, Davies et al.'s (2015) analysis of \u2018disease diplomacy\u2019 in relation to the revision of International Health Regulations for WHO member states (which expands what is expected from states in terms of detecting and containing outbreaks) raised questions about state capacities, political will and sovereignty in global health security. These debates also relate to the extent of the WHO's effectiveness in leading the agenda towards preventative health security governance based on the experience of the 2014 Ebola crisis \u2010 as opposed to taking a reactive or \u2018fire\u2010fighting\u2019 crisis management approach (Kamradt\u2010Scott, 2015).",

In security governance terms, the safeguarding of public health can only be safeguarded to the extent to which the order of global governance actors are organised to prevent threats from protecting human and animal health. One solution might be to enhance the democratisation of global health governance and the role of the WHO as a \u2018metagovernor\u2019. Questions remain about the role of the WHO in enabling deliberative processes that draw together multiple stakeholders and give a voice to communities affected by disease outbreaks. In this respect, ensuring an effective approach to deliberative policy processes for global health security is not just about ensuring that the right sets of interdisciplinary technocratic actors are around the table to inform security approaches and practices, but it is also about how the actor network is widened to enhance the representative claims of the WHO as a major international organisation. The fact that the WHO \u2018works through multi\u2010stakeholder partnerships\u2019 (Legge, 2016, p.7) indicates that more needs to be done to work with multiple stakeholders to facilitate mechanisms for the uploading of bottom\u2010up preferences from communities in an effort to promote global democratisation processes. Indeed, there has been a step\u2010change over the past decade in the \u2018political support for a trans\u2010disciplinary One Health approach to endemic zoonoses \u2026 with greater recognition that \u201cpackaged\u201d interventions that simultaneously address a variety of endemic zoonotic infections that may reduce the risk of disease emergence and re\u2010emergence\u2019 (Vandersmissen and Wellburn, 2014, p. 426). In terms of working with multiple stakeholders, the WHO could shift its institutional identity and capacities to one that of \u2018metagovernor\u2019. Metagovernance, according to Bevir (2014, p. 31), refers to the \u2018governance of governance\u2019. It is also about the style and manner of governing that focuses on how governmental institutions \u2018set the ground rules and parameters within which network governance emerges and operates\u2019 (Flinders and Judge, 2017, p.9). Flinders and Judge (2017, p.9) suggest, rightly, that the ultimate test or \u2018display\u2019 of the capacity for metagovernance is \u2018revealed when governments respond to specific crises or failures by pulling functions, powers and responsibilities back into governmental structures\u2019. Crucially, for One Health, what we have seen to date is a lack of \u2018metagoverning\u2019 on global health security governance and the 2014 Ebola crisis response is a strong indicator of institutional deficits in executing cohesive and cross\u2010sectoral crisis management.",

Although this is the case, governmental moves to focus on addressing the causes of infections at the animal\u2010human interface necessitate considerable development. One Health has risen up the policy agenda considerably over the past decade (Galaz et al.,\n2015) and it is clear that the \u2018wicked problem\u2019 of diseases at the animal\u2010public health interface will not go way anytime soon. It is therefore in the interest of states and supranational bodies to work together to build capacity to address the ongoing challenges. An aspect of leadership, going forward, should be the commissioning of research by the WHO, in partnership with the UN, FAO, and OIE, to evidence \u2018the socio\u2010economic value that the One Health approach can provide\u2019 (Vandersmissen and Wellburn, 2014, p. 421). This article has considerable sympathy with the reflections of Vandersmissen and Wellburn (2014, p. 426) (noted below) but it is for international governance organisations, such as the WHO, to provide the global policy culture, narratives and governance leadership that can facilitate less loosely\u2010bound and regionally dispersed epistemic networks:Long\u2010term institutional approaches to zoonoses management that sustainably strengthen the regional and national institutional base for One Health require a rigorous assessment of governance structures, policy processes and stakeholder networks. This can only help decision\u2010makers to better understand, and become more informed about, ways to optimise existing structures to address health risks at the animal\u2013human\u2013environment interface.

Evaluating the integration of epistemic networks and their role(s) in affecting global policy change should be the focus of future research. Getting to this point, however, is not an apolitical process due to the fact that their respective policy sectors are engulfed by different interests. It is within the context of these challenges that there is a need for One Health education and training programmes in order to temper the impact of the professional legacies. There have been positive developments in terms of the implementation of One Health initiatives as well as international and national funding in order to draw together public and animal health disciplines. There are high levels of veterinary and public health expertise in the UK (the UK hosts world renowned reference laboratories) and there have been efforts to improve joined\u2010up thinking and communication flows between the public and animal health disciplines through HAIRS and across government levels. The EU institutions are also strengthening their capacity for monitoring and evaluation of disease threats. In short, this represents the beginning of a research agenda that aims to evaluate the progress towards cross\u2010disciplinary network\u2010building and extent of policy change towards a holistic model of health security governance.
