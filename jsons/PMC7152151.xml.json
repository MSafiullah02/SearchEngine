This theory stresses the intrinsic value of all individual persons, the duty of individual dignity and respect, the value of self-determination, and the cardinal importance of patient autonomy. In secular philosophy, this theory draws heavily on the writings of Kant (1724-1804), and its essence is captured by the claim that individuals should always be treated as ends in themselves and not as means to other persons' ends.\nResource allocation: It is useful to distinguish between three levels: (1) Microallocation refers to the one-on-one encounter between patient and caregiver and is dominated usually by duty-based or deontological ethics. (2) Mesoallocation refers to allocations by program directors, taking into account the needs of programs and individuals. (3) Macroallocation refers to allocation at the levels of government, taking into account wide-ranging social policies. Mesoallocation and macroallocation tend to reflect utilitarian or consequentialist ethics. (A fourth allocative level\u2014mega-allocation\u2014may be used in reference to policies involving international relations and allocations.)\nRisk/Benefit: To the deontologist, this ratio (or calculus) refers to the risk taken and the benefit achieved by a given individual in a given situation. It should be distinguished from the concept of risk to the risk taker balanced against the benefit to another, others or society as a whole, although that calculus may have to be made in some situations using a utilitarian approach. A similar conceptual differentiation applies to burden/benefit analysis.\nUtilitarianism: The other well-known tradition in ethics. It contrasts with deontology. This is an outcomes-based or consequentialist theory, based on the ethical objective of maximizing utility, or achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. It may use statistical probabilities applied to groups of individuals. The term teleology also is used for outcome-based ethics (telos [Greek] = end, or goal).\nXenotransplantation: In the human setting, the use of live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source transplanted or implanted into a human or used for ex vivo contact with human body fluids, cells, tissues, or organs that subsequently are given to a human recipient. Xenografts include live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source used for xenotransplantation.\nXenozoonosis: Infection resulting from xenotransplantation, especially of viable perfused organs, in which the risk of generating new viruses exists (e.g., retroviruses). New forms of bacterial and fungus infection may result from mutations.\n",

Neither theory can be exclusively applied; both serve to bring relevant ethical perspectives into debate of difficult issues. In transplantation, because of the severely limited resource of available transplantable organs, transplant teams, while being aware of their deontological obligations to each patient, are forced to draw more on utilitarian considerations in making allocative decisions. Considerable ethical tension is created by this mesolevel obligation to utility (greatest good for the greatest number) because of the tendency for it to override duty owed to each individual as a unique person, at the microallocative level.",

The process was initiated by a Harvard Medical School consensus in 1968,9 and there is near-universal acceptance that a person is dead when there is irreversible loss of function of the entire brain, including the brainstem.109 This definition recognizes that a body may be dead even though the heart is beating and the circulation is maintained with a blood pressure that is adequate for organ perfusion. This definition means that the animate and the vegetative parts of the brain must be irreversibly nonfunctional.93 This concept can be difficult for families to understand and accept, especially when their recently brain-damaged loved one is warm to touch and has an evident heartbeat and other functions. It is a measure of public trust in the medical profession, in which the media has played an important part, that families can accept the diagnosis of brain death, despite these contextual and conceptual difficulties.",

If these two are irretrievably disjoined, then human life no longer exists.\u201d111 For this opinion to prevail, we need to move from a whole-brain\u2013oriented definition of brain death to a higher brain\u2013oriented definition. This definition may come about in the future if the diagnosis of irretrievable loss of all higher brain functions becomes more precise and certain.

Required request, required consideration, and required notification policies have been introduced widely, especially in North America, to improve collaboration, although initial improvements in obtaining organs have not always been maintained.

It would be a theft only if that individual had stolen the container for transport purposes. Some experts advocate an end to this extraordinary anomaly2 when such great value is placed on organs by would-be recipients and the professionals obligated to find them.

B's needs cannot be met by A giving her a kidney because renal failure is not B's problem. A does not have the money to meet B's need, and society would not or could not provide it. Person C is rich and in need of a kidney. If A makes a contract to give a kidney to a third party D on the understanding that D would then sell that kidney to C and use the proceeds to help B, A's contract with D is implicitly altruistic, but D's contract with C is purely commercial. The money D obtains from C enables A indirectly to carry out the altruistic intention toward B.",

Even if we concede that animals are moral subjects and not just objects, they could never be moral agents as far as humans are concerned.

            "text": "Xenotransplantation will be expensive for at least a number of years. The biotechnology companies are likely to control the cost of the organs and in the absence of real competition would want to keep this cost as high as the market would tolerate. The cost of rearing source animals under special conditions, monitoring them, developing laboratory tests, training staff, taking extra precautions, monitoring recipients and contacts, and installing infection control measures all would add to the cost. There also is the question of who would pay for expensive new immunosuppression.69 It is unknown if, in the long run, the cost would decrease sufficiently for this to be one of the justifications for xenotransplantation. When the results achieve sufficient success to be seen as established treatment and not clinical research, countries with ethical commitment to equity in access to established therapies would need to assess carefully how to maintain the principle of distributive justice.",
