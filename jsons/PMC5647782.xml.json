In addition, voiding is under voluntary control and depends on learned behavior that develops during maturation of the central nervous system, whereas many other visceral organs are regulated involuntary.2, 3\n",

This EUS bursting during voiding is characterized by clusters of high-frequency spikes separated by low tonic activity, and produces rhythmic contractions and a relaxation of EUS that present a pumping action of EUS.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The EUS bursting activity and pressure oscillations in cystometrograms are abolished by bungarotoxin, a neuromuscular blocker or pudendal nerve transection in rats,10, 13, 14 suggesting that the EUS pumping activity plays an important role in efficient bladder emptying. This bursting activity is thought to generate high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) measured by urethral perfusion pressure, which are mainly shown in some species, such as rat and dog.2 However, in normal mice, only a minority exhibits bursting-like EUS activity, and it has little impact on voiding efficiency,11 indicating that there are species differences regarding the neural control of bladder and sphincter function during voiding. However, the precise mechanisms of voluntary and reflex controls of bladder and urethra in humans still need to be clarified, although in brain imaging studies using functional MRI, various brain regions are identified to be involved in the storage and voiding phases of micturition.15\n",

Excitation of postsynaptic neurons by ACh is mediated by nicotinic receptors. Postganglionic axons continue for a short distance in the pelvic nerve and terminate in the detrusor layer where they release ACh to induce contractions of the smooth muscle fibers of the detrusor. This stimulatory effect of ACh at the postganglionic axon terminal is mediated by muscarinic receptors in detrusor cells. Two muscarinic subtypes, M2 and M3, are known to be present in the bladder; although M2 is most abundant in detrusor cells, the M3 subtype is the major receptor mediating stimulation of detrusor contractions.5, 16, 17 Parasympathetic postganglionic nerves also release nonadrenergic, noncholinergic transmitters (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), which act on P2X1 purinoceptors.18\n",

Storage function is primarily maintained by the spinal-cord reflex, which enhances the activity of the sympathetic and somatic nerves innervating the EUS. This function is also facilitated by the pontine storage center, which lies ventrolateral to the pontine micturition center (PMC), the hypothalamus, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the frontal cortex. In those without neurologic deficits, the micturition reflex depends on the spinobulbospinal reflex, which involves the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the midbrain and in the PMC.31 The PAG is thought to mediate switching from storage to voiding, and the PMC, which is located in or adjacent to the locus coeruleus, has spinal descending fibers containing glutamate as a major excitatory neurotransmitter, which project to the sacral cord intermediate column. Fibers that contain \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine as inhibitory neurotransmitters also project from the PMC to the Onuf nucleus. These fibers are able to suppress urethral sphincter activity during voiding. In addition, the mechanism of switching from storage to voiding in the PAG is thought to be regulated by higher brain structures, such as the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex. Overall, owing to the complexities of the neural mechanisms regulating the LUT, a wide variety of neurologic diseases, such as CI, PD, MS, SCI, and spina bifida, affect micturition and are able to induce lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction (see Fig. 4).",

At present, the terminology of lower urinary tract dysfunction in basic animal research is not yet standardized. Also, it is not known which urodynamic findings in animals directly correspond to human conditions of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Therefore, this article avoids the use of the term overactive bladder, which is a symptom-based disease definition, when describing the urodynamic findings of animal models. Also, based on the international continence society standardization, detrusor overactivity (DO) in humans is defined as the unexpected bladder muscle (the detrusor) contraction during bladder filling. Thus, the term DO is used only when animals exhibit nonvoiding bladder contractions during the storage phase in cystometric analyses. In other cases in which frequent voiding with reduced voided volume in voiding behavior studies or reduced intercontraction intervals with decreased bladder capacity during cystometry are observed, the condition is called bladder overactivity to avoid the confusion with DO. In addition, the term detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) is used when the tonic activity of EUS-EMG is increased or the urethral pressure becomes positive values above 0 cmH2O in urethral perfusion pressure measurements during voiding bladder contractions.",

However, using animal models of CI, it has been reported that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic excitatory mechanisms play an important role in bladder overactivity induced by CI. Pretreatment with MK-801, an NMDA receptor agonist, can prevent bladder overactivity in CI rats.39 Rats with CI also exhibit the upregulation of D2-like dopamine receptor-mediated excitatory mechanisms and alteration in dopaminergic-glutamatergic interaction in the brain.40, 41, 42 Disruption of GABAergic43 and glycinergic44 inhibitory mechanisms in the brain is also involved to enhance the micturition reflex. Thus, the balance between excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory glycinergic or GABAergic might be impaired after CI, which results in bladder overactivity.",

In a recent study in CI rats, leak point pressure was 29% lower compared with normal rats,45 and duloxetine, an NE and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, failed to enhance the sneeze-induced urethral continence reflex,45 suggesting that CI impairs the urethral continence mechanism to induce stress urinary incontinence. Robinson and Bloom46 postulated that ischemic lesions may interrupt the biogenic amine-containing axons ascending from the brainstem to the cerebral cortex, leading to decreased availability of biogenic amines in limbic structures of the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as in the basal ganglia. The monoamine theory postulates that depression is associated with low levels of monoamines, particularly NE, serotonin, and dopamine.47 In addition, monoaminergic descending pathways projecting through the dorsolateral spinal column are instrumental in the regulation of pain.48 Thus, ascending and descending pathways through the raphe nuclei and the locus coeruleus, which are the major sources of spinal serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways, respectively,49 in the brain stem may be disrupted by the stroke lesion, which may result in impaired urethral continence function.",

These symptoms result from decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, usually caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the pathways from the substantia nigra to the striatum in the midbrain. Patients with PD also often have lower urinary tract symptoms, such as nocturia, increased urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence, which overlap with those of overactive bladder symptoms. The reported incidence of such symptoms ranges from 27% to 63.9% across different studies.50 The most common finding in the urodynamic study is DO, shown by uninhibited contractions during bladder filling, which result from impaired activity of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways.51, 52 A previous functional brain imaging study has shown some overlaps (PAG, thalamus, putamen, and insula), as well as differences (pons or anterior cingulate gyrus only in healthy volunteers) in brain activation sites during filling between healthy volunteers and subjects with PD who had DO.53\n",

Clinical studies of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists also provided promising results of motor dysfunction in PD subjects.62, 63 Istradefylline, an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, has been already approved and launched for patients with PD, which also may be a promising candidate for treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction in patients with PD.64 To support this assumption, a recent open-labeled clinical study reported that treatment with istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, for 12 weeks significantly improved lower urinary tract symptoms in 13 male PD patients64 although a larger-sized, placebo-controlled randomized study is needed to confirm the results.",

This reflex mimics a neonatal exteroceptive micturition reflex that is activated by the mother licking the perineal region for the expelling of urine.76, 77 Maximal voiding pressure is increased, voiding efficiency is reduced, and bladder undergoes marked hypertrophy.6, 8, 78 Bladder-sphincter coordination is impaired, leading to DSD.79, 80, 81, 82, 83 Thus, the organization of the micturition reflex shows marked changes after SCI (Fig. 6\n). Any injury to the spinal cord, such as blunt, degenerative, developmental, vascular, infectious, traumatic, and idiopathic injury, can cause voiding dysfunction. In cats with chronic thoracic spinal cord transection, micturition is induced by C-fiber afferent pathways. It has been demonstrated that in chronic spinalized cats, desensitization of TRPV1-expressing C-fiber afferent pathways by subcutaneously administered capsaicin, a C-fiber neurotoxin that binds to TRPV1 receptors, completely blocked DO shown by nonvoiding bladder contractions during the storage phase, whereas capsaicin had no inhibitory effects on reflex bladder contractions in spinal intact cats.80, 84 Thus, it is plausible that C-fiber bladder afferents that usually do not respond to bladder distension27, 28 become mechanosensitive and initiate automatic micturition after SCI.",

In addition, although the role of BDNF has not been well-defined, a previous study by Frias and colleagues101 demonstrated that BDNF may be an important regulator of neurogenic DO appearance and maintenance because the early-phase administration of BDNF inhibited neurogenic DO, whereas, at later stages, BDNF sequestration reduced neurogenic DO in a rat model of SCI.",

Also, intrathecal muscimol and baclofen (GABAA and GABAB agonists, respectively) in SCI rats inhibit nonvoiding bladder contractions by suppressing C-fiber bladder afferents,110 and they improve DSD as well.12 Baclofen is approved for treatment of DO in SCI patients,112 but this agent has not been widely used because the therapeutic window of this drug is modest with the limited dose range due to side effects. Gene delivery of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the GABA synthesis enzyme, by using nonreplicating herpes simplex virus vectors inhibits DO or DSD without affecting voiding contraction in SCI rats.113, 114 Therefore, GAD gene therapy can restore urine storage function without affecting voiding function; therefore, it would be more beneficial than drug therapy for the treatment of urinary problems in SCI patients. In addition, a recent study using rats with partial SCI induced by bilateral dorsal lesions of the thoracic spinal cord has demonstrated that the treatment with a P2X7 ATP receptor antagonist at the injured spinal cord region reduced DO induced after SCI and that P2X7 receptors were expressed in CD11b-positive microglia cells.115 Because the ATP release from the spinal cord during bladder distension is reportedly increased in SCI rats compared with spinal intact rats,116 it is conceivable that the ATP-mediated excitatory mechanism in the spinal cord via P2X7 receptors expressed in microglia cells is enhanced to induce neurogenic DO after SCI. Overall, various levels of changes in both central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as in the lower urinary tract seem to contribute to neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction such as DO after SCI.",

However, SCI mice do not exhibit clear EUS bursting or intravesical pressure oscillation but rather exhibit intermittent voiding with slow large-amplitude reductions in intravesical pressure, which occur during periods of reduced EUS activity.11 \u03b1-Bungarotoxin improved voiding by reducing urethral outlet resistance in SCI rats14; however, in normal rats, the toxin reduced voiding, probably by suppressing high-frequency phasic sphincter activity necessary for efficient urine elimination in normal animals. Thus, the reflex EUS pumping activity recovers and enables achieving efficient voiding, even after SCI in rats, whereas it is not the case in SCI mice.11 These results suggest that the difference in voiding efficiency after SCI in these 2 species might be due to the difference in urethral activity during the voiding phase, which should be taken into account in the basic research of SCI-induced neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction such as DSD. In addition, bilateral transection of hypogastric nerve, which provides the major sympathetic input to the urinary bladder and proximal urethra, improved voiding dysfunction in SCI rats118 although the role of hypogastric nerves in SCI mice has not been investigated.",

            "text": "Fig.\u00a04: Neural circuitry relevant to micturition. The lower urinary tract consists of 2 major components: the bladder, and the urethra. The bladder is mainly innervated by the parasympathetic pelvic nerve. The urethra is innervated by the sympathetic hypogastric nerve and somatic pudendal nerve, respectively. Urinary storage depends on the reflex arc of the sacral spinal cord. The storage reflex is thought to be tonically facilitated by the brain, particularly the pontine storage center. The storage function is thought to be further facilitated by the hypothalamus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and frontal cortex. Central cholinergic fibers from the nucleus basalis Meynert (NBM; also called the Ch4 cell group) seem to facilitate urinary storage. Micturition depends on the reflex arc of the brainstem and spinal cord, which involves the midbrain PAG and the PMC (located in or adjacent to the locus coeruleus [LC]). The voiding function is thought to be initiated by the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex, which overlap the storage-facilitating area. CI induces the neural damage in the cerebrum. PD is primarily induced by degeneration of dopaminergic (DAgic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). MS is induced by focal demyelization of the central nervous system at various levels. SCI is induced by complete or incomplete neural damages of the spinal cord at different levels. Spina bifida is caused by a failure of the caudal neural tube to fuse normally in early development, thus often inducing the damage of the lumbosacral spinal cord and resulting in myelomeningocele, in which the spinal cord and neural elements are exposed.

Micturition reflex is controlled by spinobulbospinal pathways through PAG in midbrain and PMC in brainstem. This neural circuit is under control of higher centers, including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other cortex regions. (A) Under normal conditions tonic inhibition from ACC suppress micturition reflex. Tonic firing (+) of dopaminergic neurons in SN activates dopamine D1 receptors expressed on GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the striatum to induce tonic GABAergic inhibition (\u2212) of the micturition reflex at the level of PAG. At the same time, D1 receptor stimulation suppresses the activity of adenosinergic neurons, which exert an excitatory effect on micturition via adenosine A2A receptors (+). (B) In PD, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) are lost (lesion), leading to the loss of dopamine D1 receptors activation (D1 [loss of activation]), which results in reduced activation inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the striatum (GABA [loss of inhibition]). At the same time, reduced D1 receptor stimulation enhances the adenosinergic mechanism to stimulate adenosine A2A receptors (adenosine A2A [++]), leading to facilitation of the spinobulbospinal pathway controlling the micturition reflex pathway. Administration of dopamine D1 receptor agonist (SKF 38393) can restore the GABAergic nerve activity and suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation to reduce bladder overactivity in PD. Also, administration of adenosine A2A antagonists (ZM241385 or istradefylline) can suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation of the micturition reflex to reduce bladder overactivity in PD. Dopamine D2 receptors (D2 [+]) expressed in the spinal cord enhances the micturition reflex.",

SCI rostral to the lumbosacral spinal cord level eliminates voluntary and supraspinal control of voiding. Over a period of several weeks following SCI, a spinal reflex mechanism emerges, which is triggered by unmyelinated C-fiber bladder afferents. A\u03b4-fiber bladder afferent inputs are ineffective. Stimulation of C-fiber bladder afferents by instillation of ice water into the bladder (cold stimulation) activates voiding responses. Pretreatment with capsaicin that desensitizes TRPV1-expressing C-fiber afferent pathways reduces detrusor overactivity in chronic SCI rats but does not block the micturition reflex in normal rats.",
