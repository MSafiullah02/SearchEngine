Positive-stranded RNA viruses are well known for their ability to induce the remodeling of intracellular membranes to form a scaffold for viral replication complexes [1,2]. However, the exact origins of the membranous structures and the pathways responsible for their formation remain to be fully elucidated. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is utilized by a large number of viruses, other membranous organelles can also be exploited by viruses. Recent studies have shown that the membranous structures contain markers for autophagosomes, suggesting a pivotal role for autophagy in controlling replication of positive-stranded RNA viruses [3,4].",

Autophagy was previously regarded to be non-selective. However, increasing evidence has suggested the selectivity of autophagy in recycling unwanted organelles, removing aggregate-prone proteins, and clearing specific viral proteins [6\u20138]. The importance of selective autophagy in different physiological and pathological states has been increasingly recognized. Recently, autophagy has emerged as a critical player in the control of viral infection and immunity [9\u201313]. On the one hand, autophagy can serve as a host defense mechanism for some pathogens, such as sindbis virus and herpes simplex virus, by clearing them out of the cells [14\u201316]. On the other hand, many positive-stranded RNA viruses have been reported to subvert this cellular machinery to favor their own replication and release.",

The process of autophagy can be divided into four sequential steps (Fig. 1). Initially, a crescent-shaped double-membrane vesicle (DMV) called isolation membrane or phagophore is formed to sequester misfolded proteins and damaged organelles (induction and nucleation step). Subsequently, the two ends of phagophore fuse to form a complete DMV termed as autophagosome (elongation step). Finally, the outer membrane of the autophagosomes fuses with lysosomes to form autolysosomes while the inner membrane and the cargo enwrapped in autophagosomes are degraded by hydrolyses (fusion step). Autophagosomes can also fuse with early or late endosomes to form amphisomes [19].\n",

For Atg5\u2013Atg12 conjugation, Atg12 is first activated by Atg7 and then transferred to Atg10. Atg12 finally forms a conjugate with Atg5 to activate the formation of autophagosomes [22]. For LC3\u2013phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation, nascent LC3 is first cleaved by Atg4 to become LC3-I, which is subsequently activated by Atg7 and then transferred to Atg3. Finally, LC3 is conjugated to PE to form a LC3\u2013PE complex (LC3-II), which participates in the formation of autophagosomes [22]. Recruitment of LC3 protein to autophagic vesicles has been considered a common trait of autophagosome formation. In addition, conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II has been widely accepted as a marker of autophagic signaling [23].",

Thus, defects in autophagy have been associated with several pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases, myopathy, cancer, and aging [29\u201331]. Autophagy has also been implicated in the modulation of infection and immunity. Autophagy serves as a critical component of innate immune response by removing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans from the host cells through xenophagy, whose targets are foreign bodies rather than self-molecules [32,33]. The antigens are then presented through MHC class II molecules, initiating adaptive immune response [34]. In this process, autophagy participates and assists both innate and adaptive immunity to clear the pathogens out of the body. However, as opposed to the anti-viral activity, many positive-stranded RNA viruses have successfully developed strategies to hijack autophagy to foster their replication.",

However, since autophagy is a dynamic process composed of autophagosome formation and degradation, the increased autophagosomes can be a result of increased formation, decreased fusion with lysosomes, or both. Autophagic flux is a measurement of the balance between the rate of autophagosome formation and degradation. Thus, it is more meaningful to determine the rate of autophagic flux to have an integrated view of the complete process [69,70].",

Co-localizations of non-structural proteins 2B, 2C, and 3A with LC3 and between structural protein VP1 and Atg5 were also reported in FMDV-infected cells [42].

This study provides indirect evidence that autophagosomes are critical components during CVB3 replication, likely by serving as virus anchoring and replication sites. Similar to the observation in CVB3, inhibition of the fusion between autophagosomes or amphisomes and lysosomes was found to increase the viral yield of DENV-2 [60]. These data together with the discoveries that DENV-2 replication complexes co-localize with LC3 and an endosome marker imply that DENV-2 may use the amphisomes as sites for viral replication [60]. However, this effect seems to be viral serotype-specific. It was found that inhibition of lysosome fusion reduces DENV-3 yields and results in an accumulation of viral NS1 [55]. The mechanisms by which autophagy favors DENV-3 replication remain elusive.",

In the study of the biological relevance of autophagy in poliovirus infection, it was found that the decreases in extracellular virus are always more profound than intracellular virus when important autophagic proteins are knocked down [3]. The lower levels of viral particles in extracellular virus in autophagy-suppressing cells have been correlated with reduced non-lytic release of cytoplasmic contents that can be mediated by autophagy [3,83].

They provided evidence that complete autophagic process is required to promote HCV replication and this is largely due to the suppressive effect of autophagy on anti-viral innate immune response [54,84]. Upon HCV infection, the innate immune response is initiated by activation of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) production mediated by HCV-derived pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) [54]. Inhibition or activation of UPR-mediated autophagy has been shown to increase or reduce IFN-\u03b2 production mediated by HCV-derived PAMP, respectively [54]. Similar observation was also made with DENV-derived PAMP, suggesting that both viruses may share the same mechanism to evade the innate immune response [54]. Moreover, Shrivastava et al. [84] also reported that inhibition of autophagy by knocking down beclin-1 or Atg7 reduces HCV replication, which is accompanied by the activation of IFN signaling pathway, as measured by increased levels of IFN-regulated genes, including IFN-\u03b2, 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b1-inducible protein 27 mRNAs. Together, these studies indicate an important mechanism by which HCV avoids the innate immune response through activating the host autophagy pathway.",

It regulates lipid metabolism through modulating the degradation of triglycerides stored in lipid droplets, a process called lipophagy [85,86]. Autophagy therefore represents a new cellular process for abnormalities in lipid metabolism and accumulation. Recent study has shown a novel mechanism responsible for autophagy-mediated pro-viral properties toward DENV replication [53]. It was reported that DENV-induced autophagosomes deliver the lipid droplets to lysosomes where triglycerides are depleted and the free fatty acids are released [53]. The released free fatty acids undergo \u03b2-oxidation in mitochondria to generate ATP affording the energy for DENV replication [53]. Although the exact signaling pathway contributing to this selective autophagy and the detailed mechanisms responsible for ATP regulation of DENV replication remain unclear, the findings in this research provide the first evidence linking viral infection to autophagy-mediated metabolic regulation. Whether this mechanism also applies to other viruses requiring the host cellular metabolism for their replication warrants further investigation.",

In exploring the mechanisms underlying the pro-viral role of autophagy in HCV life cycle, it was found that HCV infection in autophagy-knockdown cells promotes cell death, suggesting a role of autophagy in prolonging cell survival for the establishment of successful viral infection [84]. The cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis has also been reported in CVB4 infection [38].

As alluded to earlier, the significance of selective autophagy in many cellular processes has been increasingly appreciated [6,8]. It is therefore conceivable that autophagy-mediated proteolysis of host anti-viral factors may also play a role in promoting viral growth. In addition, appropriate concentrations of viral proteins have been reported to be critical for the optimal replication of viruses and too much viral proteins could be a drawback for positive-stranded RNA viral replication [92\u201394]. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that viruses can exploit the host ubiquitin-proteasome system for viral protein degradation to provide the proper stoichiometric ratio of structural and non-structural viral proteins during viral life cycle [95\u201398]. Thus, it is tempting to postulate that autophagy may also be advantageous for viral replication by degrading excess viral non-structural proteins. Indeed, lysosome-mediated proteolysis has been suggested to be involved in the rapid turnover of HCV NS2 [99]. p62-mediated selective autophagic degradation has also been reported for SIN capsid protein although this role was demonstrated to be anti-viral [15].",

In response to SIN infection, mice with beclin-1 overexpression have improved survival rate, reduced viral loads, and attenuated viral pathogenesis as compared to control mice [14]. Study using neuron-specific Atg5 knockout mice showed that disruption of Atg5 gene leads to enhanced susceptibility of mouse central nervous system to SIN infection [15]. Further investigation demonstrated that loss of Atg5 in SIN-infected neurons results in impaired viral capsid protein clearance, increased p62 accumulation, and accelerated cell death, without affecting viral replication and type I IFN production [15]. In vitro study showed that p62 binds directly to viral capsid protein and transports it to autophagosomes for lysosome-mediated degradation [15]. Electron microscopic analysis provided the direct evidence that SIN virions are captured inside the autophagosomes or autolysosomes [15]. This study suggests that Atg5 plays a crucial role in protecting against SIN infection in mouse central nervous system by promoting p62-mediated clearance of viral proteins, rather than modulating innate immune response or viral replication [15]. Further study is required to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which p62 mediates selective autophagic degradation of SIN capsid protein.",

Many positive-stranded RNA viruses interplay with autophagy to optimize their infection. They affect multiple aspects of viral life cycle, through promoting viral entry/uncoating, serving sites for viral replication, preventing cell death, regulating cellular metabolisms, escaping innate immunity, and controlling viral progeny release. Although the reported pro-viral function is dominant for positive-stranded RNA viruses, autophagy also plays an anti-viral role via facilitating the clearance of some viral structural proteins.",

Positive-stranded RNA viruses induce either complete or incomplete autophagy as indicated.
