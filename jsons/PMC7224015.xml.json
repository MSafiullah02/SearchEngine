High pressures against the trachea may impede mucosal blood flow, resulting in mucosal ischaemia, necrosis [2], and tracheoesophageal fistula [3]. Low pressures could increase the risk of leakage and pulmonary aspiration. Rello [4] showed that cuff pressure below 20 cm H2O was an independent risk factor for VAP (RR = 4.23). Currently, the incidence of VAP in patients with mechanical ventilation is as high as 6\u201352% [5\u20137], which lead to the following serious consequences: VAP was associated with a 6.4-day extension of the duration of prior intubation [8], a 12.5-day extension of ICU stay [8], an average increase of $40,000 in hospital costs [5], and a 13% increase in attributable mortality [9].",

Nseir et al. measured cuff pressure every 8 h and found that cuff pressure was maintained within the recommended range in only 18% of patients [13]. Only a few large general hospitals in China have established a department of respiratory therapy [14], and the ETT cuff pressure is managed by the nurse. Xiang et al. found that only 34.8% of nurses in a class III grade I hospital in Beijing used a manometer to assess cuff pressure scientifically [15]. Fu et al. measured cuff pressure 812 times in 53 patients and found that 46.3% of pressure was not within the normal range [16]. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the normative measurement of the ETT cuff pressure. We studied the application of a mobile terminal application program in the execution of ETT cuff pressure measurement, which could ensure that only the manometer is allowed to assess cuff pressure, with the pressure measured at least three times a day, and provide convenient feedback to improve the execution of the normative measurement of the ETT cuff pressure.",

However, it is common to use unscientific methods to assess cuff pressure in clinical practice [10\u201312, 15], and pressure cannot be maintained within the recommended range [13, 16]. In addition to the lack of training in cuff pressure measurement, these issues may be related to the following conditions. First, nurses may not use a manometer: The ratio of nurses to the number of beds as low as 1.91, which increases the nursing workload in the GICU of class III grade I hospitals in East China [25], and thus, nurses would use the pilot balloon palpation method to assess pressure because it saves more time. However, the pilot balloon palpation method is less reliable in assessing pressure [10, 26]. Second, the head nurse could not obtain feedback information that the nurse measured cuff pressure using a method that was not recommended.",

The head nurse could glance at the cuff pressure measurement of each patient on the computer, including the frequency of cuff pressure measurement and the pressure values before and after measurement, which were used to supervise nurses and urge them to check cuff pressure using the recommended method.",

After the intervention, the incidence of VAP decreased, but there was no statistical significance (P > 0.05) between the baseline group and the intervention group. The main reason may be that the sample size of the study was not large enough (73 cases in the baseline group and 102 cases in the intervention group). If the sample size is increased, the incidence of VAP may be statistically significant. And VAP can be reduced by some measures, such as novel multi-modal hand hygiene system [27], endotracheal tube with polyurethane cuff and subglottic secretion drainage [28], semirecumbent position (45-degree) [29], and duodenal versus gastric feeding [30].
