            "text": "Upon acquiring a pup from a pet shop or breeding facility, gastrointestinal disease is commonly encountered (Hird et al. 1992, Scarlett et al. 1994). Because most cases of diarrhoea are self\u2010limiting (Steiner 2008, Herstad et al. 2010) and specific diagnosis is expensive and difficult to determine (Matz & Guilford 2003), little is known of the specific aetiological agents involved. Indeed, some parasites are difficult to detect because of low sensitivity of the test methods or because of intermittent shedding (Matz & Guilford 2003). Bacteriological examination is rarely performed because of the difficulties in interpretation of the results (Matz & Guilford 2003). Virological diagnostics are hindered by the limited period of faecal shedding, the possibility of false\u2010positive results due to vaccination and the need for highly specialised laboratories for virus isolation (Matz & Guilford 2003).",

Faecal samples were assigned a score ranging from 1 to 7 based on the Purina Faecal Scoring System (Nestl\u00e9\u2010Purina Pet Food Co.). To assess the general health status of the pups in relation to gastrointestinal disease, a clinical scoring system was used based on the Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) scoring system (Jergens et al. 2003). This numerical index uses the presence and frequency of six cardinal gastrointestinal signs to evaluate the degree of illness. The total cumulative scores classify the disease as clinically insignificant (0 to 3), mild (4 to 5), moderate (6 to 8) or severe (9 or greater) gastroenteritis. A questionnaire was taken for each puppy. A breeding facility with less than 10 adult dogs and a pet shop with less than 25 pups were considered small.",

            "text": "Overall, possible infectious agents were detected in all but one pup. This may be an overestimation as pups were considered positive if the group sample was positive for parasitological analyses. However, it is highly likely that if one pup in a group is infected by parasites, the other pups are also infected. The most common isolated parasitic enteropathogen was G. duodenalis, followed by T. canis and Cystoisospora spp. This is in accordance with a recent parasitic study in the Belgian dog population (Claerebout et al. 2009). This result might have been expected as dogs, younger than six months old and living in large groups, have an increased risk of contracting a parasitic infection (Claerebout et al. 2009, Gates et al. 2009). It is, however, possible that the presence of some pathogens is underestimated. For example, the sensitivity of faecal examination for detection of G. duodenalis by means of IFA is over 90% (Geurden et al. 2008), but because of intermittent excretion some infected animals may have been overlooked (Epe et al. 2010). Toxocara canis is a well\u2010known parasite in pet shops and breeding facilities and regular deworming schedules were maintained. All pups, of which the deworming status was known, were dewormed less than a month before sampling. However, half of the sampled population was positive for T. canis. This could also be an underestimation as only the adult T. canis worms are detected and not the migrating larvae. A plausible explanation is that the hygiene measures are inadequate to avoid reinfection. Indeed, the eggs and oocysts of the parasites are very resistant and a correct disinfectant and frequent cleaning are of primary importance to decrease the infection pressure (Overgaauw 1997). This clearly could be improved in some of the facilities. Also the used antihelminthics are not effective against larval stages.",

The lack of evidence of the presence of canine enteric viruses, as opposed to the high seroprevalence rates of especially CCoV which can increase from 44% up to 100% in pups (Tennant et al. 1993, Bandai et al. 1999, Squires 2003) may be explained by the age of the pups sampled. A similar prevalence of approximately 40% was detected in faecal samples in other studies, with 8 of 10 positive samples originating from Belgium (Naylor et al. 2001, Schulz et al. 2008, Decaro et al. 2009).",

Of these Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. are the most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli and C. perfringens can easily be found because they are part of the normal intestinal microflora and only after detecting virulence genes, these strains may be suspected to be implicated in the development of diarrhoea. The interpretation of these results is therefore difficult (Hall 2004). There is, however, growing evidence that certain E. coli strains may cause intestinal disease in dogs (Beutin et al. 1993, Hammermueller et al. 1995, Star\u010di\u010d et al. 2002). Actually, no unambiguous differentiation is possible between non\u2010pathogenic and pathogenic strains. In this study, a very small number of samples contained genes known to be present in Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and code for the production of enterotoxins. It is remarkable that the only sample containing STa as well as STb genes originated from a pup with severe diarrhoea. However, because of simultaneous parasitic infections, no clear conclusions could be made.",

However, these pups were also severely infected with T. canis, which may reduce the role of C. jejuni to that of a secondary one.

A small number of pups had a precarious BCS, but the largest part of the population was in a good condition. However, only 18 pups did not have diarrhoea and the evaluation of the clinical score showed that more than half had a mild to severe gastroenteritis. The history of diarrhoea did not appear to have an effect on the classification of the pups in the different groups. Worrisome is that all pups, except those with severe diarrhoea, were considered by the owners of being without gastroenteritis and were available for purchase (data not shown). The information on the clinical history supplied by the owners may not therefore be reliable.",

Another possible effect could be the presence of glycoprotein\u2010containing ingredients like eggs, which have been suggested to have a protective effect against pathogenic adhesive E. coli.

Moreover, further studies are required to determine the role of the isolated E. coli strains. Practitioners should be aware that diarrhoea is not only a common but also often unrecognised problem in pups. More importantly, the absence of clinical signs of gastroenteritis should not preclude the absence of enteropathogens. Secondly, only half of the pups in this population, of which a clinical score could be determined, were without clinical signs of gastroenteritis. Indeed, new pet owners should have their newly purchased puppy examined by a veterinary surgeon, even if they seem to be in good health. Specific attention should be given to basic hygiene, especially with children, to prevent zoonotic infection.",
