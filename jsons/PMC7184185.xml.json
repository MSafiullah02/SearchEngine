However, \u2018should be\u2019 does not equal \u2018is\u2019. Lingering phenomena like inequality and climate combusting \u2018will not be brought down by paying more lip service to it or by conducting more research that stays in an ivory tower\u2019 (Vandermoortele 2019). Resolving challenges which engender harm, be it to ourselves or others, requires a triple shift: from acknowledging the issue, to mustering the courage to addressing it, to actually translating the desire for change into concrete behavior change, beginning with our own personal action.",

Impact measurement differs from output volume. While the sheer quantity of data coming from Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms is gratifying for results-oriented activists, tangible evidence to prove the influence of online mobilization on human behavior remains sparse. Beyond clicks, likes, and short-term donations, the sustainable transformation of attitudes and belief-systems remains one of the unexplored frontiers of social change. There is little evidence that, once a Twitter storm has raged for a time and the calm has returned, there is any real and meaningful change.",

Amid this abundance and diversity, one common parameter seems to characterize and connect those rare institutions that have outlasted the start-up stage and moved past log frames and matrix madness, donor domination, and implementation illusion. This parameter is the level to which their staff personifies the values that the organization pursues. Beyond funding level and mission statement, marketing creativity and positioning skills, at the heart of aid groups and nonprofit organizations that survive and leave their mark is the mindset of those who work inside the organization. This mindset matters more than anything else, with organizational performance linked to whether the personal aspirations and the subsequent behavior of the staff are in synch with the mission of their employer. Do their inner values match those of the organization? Do they live by the code of these values in everyday life, both in the spotlight and the shadows? Do they practice what they preach?",

            "text": "The quest to influence the attitudes, beliefs, and behavior of so-called beneficiaries of aid programs has gradually led to the field of Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC). As understood already in the 1980s, \u2018social marketing is an underutilized yet powerful means of changing behavior\u2019,4 and thereby changing Society. But even though the scientific research that many SBCC approaches use to understand their target adopters makes them a resource to learn from, the present state of the World seems to indicate that their impact is limited. One shortcoming is that they have failed to delve deep enough to pierce through to the level of understanding into implementation. Even in the cases where in-depth Knowledge Attitude Practice (KAP) studies were conducted to understand the factors that underpin certain behavior patterns and the social norms underneath, action usually fell short (Zaltman 1971). The current fast-paced, short-lived nature of most aid programs is not conducive to the implementation of systematic long-term programs dedicated to behavioral change. Results-based management can be a blessing or a curse, depending on the orientation behind it. It may nurture a culture of seeking concrete and meaningful transformation, but it can also lead to a focus on material assets that can be touched, counted, and photographed. The abundance of clinics and community health centers that were built with the funds of well-intentioned donors but subsequently abandoned for lack of staff, equipment, medication, or demand is just one illustration of this phenomenon. As the absence of large-scale sustainable transformation seems to indicate, a different approach is required rather than more of the same. As the popular saying goes, \u2018If you always do what you always did, you will always get what you always got\u2019 (O\u2019Toole 2019).",

These questions require an honesty that does not come naturally or easily to institutions or individuals. Human nature is geared towards the path of least resistance, while soul searching is cumbersome and awkward. A most obvious question for all concerned: \u2018Do those who defend human rights as part of their profession, such as United Nation officials, Government agents, or NGO workers, inspire by example?\u2019 At the beginning of their career, those who choose to work in the aid sector are usually driven by genuine passion. They believe that making the World a better place can and must be done. But as time passes, experience intrudes, disappointments are encountered, and habits take root; things change. Slowly passion fades; cynicism, fatigue, and disillusionment creep in. Standing up for change, beyond institutional campaign orchestration, no longer comes intuitively. Some leave, many stay. Material considerations, paychecks, promotions, and pension perspectives become criteria when earlier they were not.",

At the same time it illustrates that we are all the same. Beyond nationalities and income, gender and culture everyone is at risk of getting sick.\u2018We have extra responsibilities, which means that we have more need to act cooperatively\u2019. See Stiglitz\u2019s (2008) Geary Lecture, Making Globalisation Work.\u2018The issue is really whether it will change in the face of a crisis, or a series of crises, like the crises we had in 1997 and 1998, lurching from one patch-up to another, with each patch-up leading to a crisis maybe two years down the line, maybe ten years down the line, or whether we should approach it from the point of view of trying to understand why globalization has not been working and how we might fix it\u2019. See Stiglitz\u2019s (2008) lecture on globalization.The 5 steps of a traditional social marketing management process include: (1) analyzing the social marketing environment; (2) researching and selecting the target adopter population; (3) designing social marketing strategies; (4) planning social marketing mix programs; and (5) organizing, implementing, controlling, and evaluating the social marketing effort. See Roberto and Kotler\u2019s (1989).In parts of this book, I will use the \u2018we\u2019 form when writing about the humanitarian sector. Having been a humanitarian worker for 18 years, I now seek change from the inside out, while pursuing it from the outside in.The beginnings of organized international humanitarian aid can be traced to the late nineteenth century. The most well-known origin story of formalized humanitarian aid is that of Henri Dunant, a Swiss business man and social activist, who upon seeing the sheer destruction and inhumane abandonment of wounded soldiers from the Battle of Solferino in June 1859, canceled his plans and began a relief response. Refer to Haug\u2019s (1993) The Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n",
