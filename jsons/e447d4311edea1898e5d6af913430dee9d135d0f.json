When dealing with healthcare monitoring, privacy and data security should be carefully considered.

The failure of GFT emphasizes the utilization of other real-time health data for predicting trends in infectious diseases. 14 A more critical evaluation of the uses of IoT in surveillance must be addressed, as well as a deeper look into the privacy concerns that its use brings. In addition to web-based tools for surveillance, event-based IoT tracking collects and sends raw data from a multitude of informal sources (news articles, social media posts, internet queries) in an attempt to detect events with potential epidemic spread faster than traditional more conservative methods. 9 This has led to advances in infectious disease modeling and pathogen discovery and diagnostics (rapid molecular identification of pathogens). 9 Mobile computing in the form of mobile health (m-health) can also increase the efficiency of a healthcare system by involving various services, applications, third party APIs, and mobile sensors not otherwise used for health-related purposes. 15 Safety and Health Monitoring Applications such as wearable IoT enables real-time health monitoring and would be beneficial for improving global health.",
