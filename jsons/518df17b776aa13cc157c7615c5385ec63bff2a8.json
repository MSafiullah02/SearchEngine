Although most countries, including Canada 14 and the US, have closed their borders to non-essential travel, confirmed cases and deaths are 15 still increasing likely due to community transmission and increased capacity for testing. To The number of PPE (e.g., facemasks) used daily in Africa is estimated to reach seven hundred 26 million (see Table 1 ), as several African states (e.g., Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa) with 27 confirmed COVID-19 cases have mandated compulsory facemask use for their citizens.

The use of personal 20 protective equipment (PPE) such as medical gloves, facemasks, and aprons has been 21 recommended for essential service workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, caregivers, etc.) and other 22 people handling patients infected with COVID-19.

            "text": "Millions of contaminated PPEs (e.g., facemasks and gloves) would end up as wastes,29    which, if improperly managed, can pose environmental and health threats, especially as a 30 recent study(Kampf et al., 2020) finds that the coronavirus can survive on material surfaces 31 (e.g., metals, glass, and plastics) for up to 9 days. Such threats may be ameliorated in 32 developed countries where green and sustainable waste management strategies, capable of 33 containing such viruses, are practiced. However, the threats would be much higher in 34 developing countries that have poor waste management strategies. In many developing35 countries, solid wastes are dumped in the open and in poorly managed landfills where waste 36 pickers without wearing proper PPE would scavenge for recyclable materials (World Bank, 37 2019). Such landfills also serve as a \"food bank\" for livestock such as dogs and goats, which 38 can roam about in developing countries such as Nigeria. Such acts may expose humans and 39 livestock to diseases (including COVID-19), exacerbating their spread. It was reported that 40 following the interment of a COVID-19 patient at the Gudu Cemetery in Abuja (Nigeria), a 41 Mortician dumped his disposable safety coverall in a public space; the Public Health 42 Department in Nigeria had to intervene to decontaminate the space (Ebeleke, 2020). This is 43 another example where improper management of contaminated PPEs may increase the spread 44 of viral disease. 45 Improper disposal or disinfection of plastic bottles used for packaging drinks and 46 water sold in many developing countries, including in healthcare facilities and isolation 47 centers, may be another potential source of viral disease spread in those countries. Used 48 bottles may be contaminated with the virus (Butot et al., 2007). However, disposed/used 49 bottles are often sourced and reused to package locally made drinks and herbal medicines that 50 are sold across such countries. Such reuse of contaminated plastic bottles would certainly 51 increase the spread of viral diseases. 52 Although the governments of many developing countries are taking active measures 53 to contain and reduce the spread of COVID-19, strategies to manage solid wastes, including 54 used PPE, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, are lacking. The government could 55 adopt the strategies developed by the Lagos State Waste Management Authority, where 56 proactive measures are taken to restrict access of waste pickers to its landfills. Special waste 57 collection buckets to collect disposable PPEs could be provided in buildings (residential, 58 government and hospitals) and in public places. Such waste collection buckets could be 59 emptied, at least daily, by trained personnel who would then decontaminate or dispose the PPE following Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines. Used plastic bottles 61 could be decontaminated with a 70% alcohol solution, as per NCDC guidelines, before reuse 62 in packaging local drinks and herbal medicines. 63 There are other potential pathways where improper management of used PPEs can 64 pose a significant risk for increasing the transmission of COVID-19. We thus call on the 65 scientific community to voice their concerns to governments at various levels on the need to 66 develop proper strategies for managing solid wastes, such as used PPEs, to curb the spread of 67 the novel coronavirus.68",
