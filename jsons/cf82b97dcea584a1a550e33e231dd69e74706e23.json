Likely consequences of home-isolation are changes to eating and physical activity 52 behaviours. It is reasonable to hypothesise that more time spent at home promotes hypercaloric 53 diets, including larger meal sizes and increased snack frequency and size. Alternatively, fewer 54 opportunities to travel outside the home may encourage more structured meal patterns and less 55 take-away foods that are typically energy-dense. For physical activity, the lockdown would be 56 anticipated to reduce both frequency and duration, not only for typically active persons who 57 are no longer able to access gyms and health clubs, but for those who achieve sufficient levels 58 of activity incidentally, through walking or cycling to work or study. This is particularly 59 pertinent to university students attending a major campus who typically walk between classes 60 numerous times a day. To this end, the impact of COVID-19-induced isolation measures on 61 diet and physical activity patterns in Australian undergraduate students was measured one week 62 after the transition to online learning and compared with data obtained in the previous two 63 years. 64 .

There was a small (~5%) reduction in the energy density 248 of main meals consumed by male students in 2020 and, while the location of meal preparation 249 was not examined in this study, this could reflect a reduction in foods prepared away from 250 home, which are typically more energy dense compared with home-prepared foods (10). Total 251 energy intake was unaffected, indicating a compensatory increase in main meal portion size. 252 Compared with the difference in males, the maintenance of main meal energy density in 253 females may reflect their higher consumption of home-prepared meals in general, pre-254 pandemic (11). Our data suggest, however, that more time spent at home promoted a 255 hypercaloric diet in female students, which was attributed to increased frequency and energy 256 density of snacks. Foods consumed away from home, including self-prepared lunches and 257 snacks, are typically pre-portioned to a limited size. Thus, increased consumption at home may 258 result from increased food visibility and opportunities to snack, possibly exaggerated by 'panic 259 buying' and stockpiled food that coincided with national lockdown measures (12, 13). 260 .

The most recent Australian Guidelines 299 recommend adults between 18-64 years achieve at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity 300 activity, on most days of the week, to achieve health benefits (34). In our population of 301 undergraduate biomedical students, over 80% of participants were deemed to be 'sufficiently 302 active' in the control years, which well-surpasses the age-controlled Australian average of 53% 303 (35). While university educated persons have been reported to be more physically active, and 304 have a reduced risk of being overweight (36), the reductions in sufficient activity seen during 305 the COVID-19 pandemic, to 62% and 55% for males and females, respectively, is less than 306 favourable. Specific targets have been set for 'sufficient activity' to achieve substantial health 307 benefits, but the Australian Guidelines also stipulate that \"doing any physical activity is better 308 than doing none\" (34).

Therefore, in this study, the increase in sedentary 311 behaviour and reduction in physical activity raises health concerns. 312 While several weeks, or even a few months, of physical inactivity is unlikely to result in an 313 abrupt onset of metabolic disease, sudden exercise cessation can decrease insulin sensitivity, 314 cause muscle and bone loss, and abolish many of the positive exercise-induced metabolic and 315 cardiovascular adaptations (38, 39). A further consequence is, undoubtedly, the loss of 316 psychological benefits associated with physical activity (40). This may be compounded by the 317 lack of social support during isolation periods, which is also important to maintain activity 318 (41). This impact of inactivity on psychological health is further linked to the, potential stress-319 associated, increase in energy intake among female students. Arguably, the greatest risk to 320 mortality, however, is the lasting impact on behaviour, that any time in lockdown may trigger. 321 This is particularly true for those who are extrinsically motivated to participate in activity (i.e., 322 to achieve outcome-based goals such as physical appearance) versus those who are intrinsically 323 motivated and genuinely enjoy taking part in physical activity (42). It is worth noting that a 324 hasty return to pre-pandemic activity levels, upon easing of isolation measures, can raise the 325 risk of injury, particularly with the return to vigorous activity (43). 326",
