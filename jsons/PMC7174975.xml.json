Studies in adult has demonstrated higher prevalence of hypertension, and renal impairment. Apart from increase fluid intake, alkalinisation of urine and lower salt intake, thiols medications are important second line preventative strategies. There has been issues with supply of both D-Penicillamine and tiopronin and captopril is an easily available drug. Captopril, is the first angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the market and is the only ACE inhibitors that has sulfhydryl ligand that forms bond with cystine. Cystine-Captopril disulphide is 200 times more soluble than cystine and thus prevent stone formation. Captopril has demonstrated to improve blood pressure and protect renal function. Hence it could be used in patients with cystinuria and other comorbidities.1\n",

Interestingly, mortality rate was almost similar in patients with or without history of hypertension.5 A sudden withdrawal of ACE inhibitors has been discouraged as this action may result in clinical instability. At present there is scarce data to support any change in practice.",
