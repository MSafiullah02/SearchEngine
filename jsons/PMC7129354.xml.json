            "text": "One of the most important clinical applications of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is to supply a broad spectrum of antibodies to patients who are antibody deficient. Throughout their lives, patients with inherited (primary) antibody deficiencies are treated with relatively high doses of IVIG. Patients who develop secondary antibody deficiencies because of disease or disease therapy may also receive high dose IVIG for long periods of time. Since IVIG was first developed, other indications have been found to benefit from high dose IVIG to correct immunological disorders such as autoimmune diseases. The original immunomodulatory application was to induce increased platelet levels in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [1]. After this application was discovered, single or multiple courses of high dose IVIG were successfully used to treat a wide variety of other autoimmune disorders (for review see: refs. [2], [3], [4], [5]). Since regular exposure to large quantities of a human plasma protein carries the risk of infection with blood borne pathogens, increasing the pathogen safety of IVIG, without diminishing its clinical efficacy, is a high priority.",

Yellow fever vaccines stabilized with human serum produced 23,000 cases of hepatitis in American military personnel. Most epidemiological investigations strongly suggested that pooled human plasma presented a higher risk of hepatitis transmission than whole blood. This was attributed to the increased probability that pooled plasma would be contaminated by one or several donors. Since plasma pools from 250 to 2000 blood donations were being used to produce albumin, efforts were initiated to inactivate hepatitis virus in human serum albumin solutions [6].",

Unfortunately, other plasma proteins in solution are inactivated by heat and early attempts to inactivate viruses in high risk products were unsuccessful.

            "text": "Studies of IVIG manufacturing procedures suggested that cold ethanol fractionation removes viruses by two mechanisms: 1) inactivation and 2) partitioning. Several laboratories demonstrated that retroviruses, such as HIV, are inactivated by cold ethanol under conditions used in IVIG production [14], [15], [16], [17], [22]. However, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SIN), both used as models for hepatitis C virus (HCV), were stable under similar conditions [22]. Over the years, several procedures have been developed to prevent pathogen transmission and increase the safety of IVIG and other therapeutic proteins. We will describe these procedures, including the most recent technology termed \u201cvirusfiltration\u201d. The term \u201cvirusfiltration\u201d has become the accepted nomenclature for what was previously called \u201cnanofiltration\u201d [25]. Virusfiltration removes viruses regardless of the presence or absence of a lipid envelope. It also eliminates other pathogens that have the potential to transmit infections. Virusfiltration is the first totally new principle in pathogen removal incorporated into plasma protein manufacturing in the past 20 years.",

During this \u201cwindow period\u201d blood or plasma donations may transmit the pathogen. For this reason, donor screening tests were not only developed for new pathogens but also to have more sensitivity and thereby reduce the window period. G\u00fcrtler has reviewed blood-borne pathogens with respect to their relevance to transfusion [26]. Human pathogens that cause chronic, progressive wasting or lethal diseases, and some infectious agents that are not prevalent in the transfused population, were considered relevant. Using these criteria, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) were characterized as relevant. B19 virus (B19V; formerly named: Parvovirus B19), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis A viruses (HAV) were classified as occasionally relevant. Since this review was published, non-enveloped viruses such as B19V and HAV have become more relevant and new viruses (e.g. West Nile Virus, SARS corona virus) have emerged. Thus relevance of pathogens to transfusion is an evolving concept. Identification of hepatitis viruses and the development of sensitive donor screening tests became a high priority because of early concern for hepatitis transmission. A sensitive test for HBV was developed in 1972 [27] and was used to eliminate infected donors. Unfortunately, the HBV test did not eliminate transfusion-related hepatitis and the search for one or more non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses was initiated. The AIDS epidemic led to the rapid development of a screening test for antibodies to HIV-1 in 1984 [28]. In 1989, the genome of a non-A, non-B hepatitis virus was isolated and used to develop a donor screening test for HCV [29]. Today, plasma is screened for antibodies to syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, HCV, and HBV. Extremely sensitive tests for HCV, HIV-1, HAV, HBV and B19V nucleic acids have been introduced recently and are being used to reduce the window period further.",

Viruses are frequently precipitated along with the proteins. When frozen plasma is thawed at 2 \u00b0C, some proteins called cryoglobulins remain insoluble. This fraction called cryoprecipitate contains many proteins belonging to the coagulation cascade (e.g. factor VIII). But also viruses tend to partition into the cryoprecipitate. Viruses are also precipitated by cold ethanol into the fibrinogen fraction (Cohn-Oncley Fraction I) and the IgG fraction (Cohn-Oncley Fraction II + III or Kistler-Nitschmann Precipitate A; see\nFig. 1) [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [24]. The most effective virus removal step during IgG production occurs during fractional precipitation of Fraction II+III. Almost all the virus in Cohn Fraction II + III is removed during precipitation of Fraction III (Kistler-Nitschmann Precipitate B), a waste fraction that contains IgA, IgM, plasminogen and other proteins [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [24] (Fig. 1). The distribution of model viruses into plasma fractions produced by cold ethanol precipitation is illustrated in\nTable 1.",

            "text": "The challenge in developing virus inactivation procedures for protein solutions is to inactivate viruses without harming the therapeutic protein. The non-covalent bonds involved in virus assembly are the same as those that maintain proteins in their native, biologically active, three dimensional structure (conformation). Consequently, processes that inactivate viruses may also denature proteins. Some proteins can withstand small changes in conformation without losing their biological activity or may renature spontaneously. Other proteins lose biological activity from minor changes in conformation. Heat can be used to inactivate viruses and proteins. The denaturation temperature of a protein is sharply defined and is different for each protein [31]. Heating for a definite time to a temperature just below the denaturing temperature of a particular protein is used in some protein purification procedures to inactivate viruses. In the presence of substrate, enzymes can be heated to temperatures 10 \u00b0C higher than in the absence of substrate [31]. This explains how albumin was successfully stabilized. Human albumin has many binding sites for hydrophobic molecules and plays a major role in the transport of fatty acids. Filling these sites with the stabilizers acetyltryptophan and caprylic acid (a fatty acid also known as octanoic acid) allows albumin to withstand heating for 10 h at 60 \u00b0C. Since albumin has no measurable biological activity, the full impact of heating albumin is not known. Factor VIII is rapidly inactivated when heated in solution. However, dried Factor VIII is relatively heat-stable under certain conditions. In the 1980s, this observation led to the development of heat treated Factor VIII preparations [32], [33]. Fortunately, HIV and non-A non-B hepatitis was inactivated in heated Factor VIII but the products had lower biological activities, were relatively insoluble, and produced a higher incidence of Factor VIII inhibitors. Moreover, HBV was not completely inactivated [32].",

The authors also observed decreased infectivity of vaccinia and HSV in IVIG samples incubated at pH 6.9 without pepsin. These decreases were attributed to antibody mediated neutralization. Similar results were observed by Kempf et al. who studied virus inactivation in IVIG samples incubated at pH 4 with and without pepsin [21]. HIV, HSV type 1, CMV, VSV, and SFV were inactivated by pH 4 incubation with or without trace amounts of pepsin. Inactivation of HSV and CMV was also observed at pH 7. Additional experiments demonstrated that the addition of pepsin at pH 4 accelerated VSV inactivation. Further evidence of the effectiveness of low pH virus inactivation was published by Louie et al. who reported inactivation of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and HCV in IVIG incubated at pH 4.25 for 21 days at 21 \u00b0C [19].

Although proteins can also be denatured by solvents and detergents, they can be exposed to low levels for limited periods of time without significant irreversible effects on structure or function. This observation was exploited by Horowitz and his co-workers who developed a virus inactivation process that involves addition of both a solvent and detergent [39]. Solvent-detergent treatments were first applied to Factor VIII preparations and rapidly replaced heat treatments as the standard virus inactivation procedure [39]. Solvent-detergent virus inactivation was soon applied to a wide variety of other plasma proteins considered at risk of transmitting viruses. After hepatitis C transmission by IVIG was reported [11], [12], solvent-detergent virus inactivation was incorporated into several IVIG manufacturing processes [22], [23]. The use of this procedure requires incubation periods and reagent removal steps that are reported to reduce IVIG recovery and to lengthen manufacturing times [39]. It is also a considerable environmental burden. Since this reduces the capacity of IVIG production, some IVIG manufacturers are beginning to abandon solvent-detergent virus inactivation in favour of other processes [40].",

This process has been so effective that the development of filters with pore sizes small enough to remove viruses was a logical consequence. Development of virus removal filters for protein solutions was handicapped by the need to process large volumes at reasonable flow rates. Initial problems were resolved in the early 1990s and the viral safety of plasma products was improved by implementing virusfiltration at the process scale. Virusfiltration is a simple, robust, non-destructive process that adds size exclusion, a new mechanism, to conventional virus inactivation and partitioning. The use of virusfiltration to remove viruses is the first major advancement in virus safety since solvent-detergent treatment was introduced. Since it does not discriminate between enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, virusfiltration has the potential to remove the broadest range of pathogens. In 1994, Burnouf-Radosevich et al. [41] reported excellent virus removal from Factor IX and Factor XI solutions using Planova\u00ae (Ashai Kasei) virusfilters with mean pore sizes of 15 and 35 nanometres (nm). Subsequently, these new virusfilters were introduced in the manufacturing processes of other plasma derived therapeutics.",

In addition, Dichtelm\u00fcller demonstrated the excellent robustness of Planova\u00ae 35 nm dead-end virusfiltration for BVDV in IgG-solution with regard to protein and salt concentrations, pH, pressure, temperature, and volume per filter area. A >5 log10 clearance for viruses >40 nm (HIV, BVDV and PRV) was also found by van Holten [45] using a Viresolve 180 (Millipore) filter and a 5 mg/mL IgG solution. We obtained similar results with an Ultipore VF grade DV50 filter (Pall Corporation) in a 10 mg/mL IgG solution (\nTable 3). Virusfiltration has become a generally accepted, efficient, and very robust method for the removal of viruses larger than the pore size of the filter. However, differences were observed in removal studies with viruses of about the same size, or smaller than, the pore size of the virusfilter. In addition to pore size, other factors such as the composition of the IgG solution, the model virus used, and, probably the most important factor, the presence or absence of neutralising or cross-reacting antibodies may play a role. The elimination capacity for small viruses has been studied by several authors.",

Animal studies have demonstrated infectivity in blood and transmission of blood infectivity by intracerebral injection [47]. Experiments with a mouse-adapted strain of human TSE demonstrated a need for at least five to seven times more infectious agent to transmit disease by the intravenous than the intracerebral route in mice [48]. Recent studies also demonstrated that BSE and scrapie can be transmitted to sheep by intravenous injection of blood from experimentally infected sheep [49]. In another study, primates were infected with BSE by the intravenous or the oral route [50]. However, there is no evidence that plasma products have ever transmitted CJD or vCJD. Nevertheless, the theoretical risk of transmission has prompted laboratory studies to determine the behaviour of prions during plasma fractionation. TSE infectivity is mainly eliminated from IgG solutions by two mechanisms; partitioning by depth filtration and by elimination by virusfiltration. Efficient elimination of TSE infectivity from IgG solutions by depth filtration was recently reported for three different IVIG products by Gregori et al. [51] (\nTable 4), Trejo et al. [52] and by van Holten and Autenrieth [53]. The authors reported log10 reduction factors of 2.5 to 6.9.
