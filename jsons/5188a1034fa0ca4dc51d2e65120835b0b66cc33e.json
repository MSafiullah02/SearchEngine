The likelihood of an individual developing a particular disease will depend on a variety of factors including age, exposure, genetic make-up, and general nutritional and health status. Disease can impact on an individual, and can also affect a group or a population of cats. With our current understanding, and with the multi-factorial nature of risk factors, preventing most non-infectious diseases is very difficult so we have to rely on early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Infectious disease, however, may be more easily preventable using a variety of strategies including vaccination, reduction of exposure and improving resistance to infection. Despite the difficulties in recognising signs of pain, especially chronic pain, in cats, the prevention and treatment of pain is of major importance, and the development of effective easy-to administer analgesics, especially those for long-term use, should be a major research priority in veterinary medicine.",

In many cases, the impact on welfare has been related to the degree of inbreeding and a relatively small genetic pool, leading to certain diseases becoming more prevalent in a particular breed. In some cases, the body form associated with a breed can cause long-term welfare problems, for example respiratory obstruction in brachycephalic cats such as Persians. The desire of some breeders to emphasise breed characteristics has led to 'ultra' type cats, where inherent body form-associated problems have been compounded. There has been a significant increase in breeding from cats that have severe mutations in order to create a unique breed, for example Munchkin, kangaroo or twisty cats. Such mutations invariably give rise to severe welfare issues, as they cause both chronic disease and prevent the cat from being able to express natural behaviours such as jumping.",

At the individual level there may be both the physical effects of disease and treatment, preventing a cat from following its natural behavioural patterns, and the psychological aspects of the disease and treatment. At the group level, disease can have an effect in three main ways: through spread to other individuals; altering the group dynamic so as to lead to disruption of social stability; and the whole group needing treatment and/or screening, whether or not all individuals are showing clinical evidence of disease. At the population level, disease has its effect mainly on the genetic make-up of that population. This can be a direct effect, associated with individuals dying from their disease or having passed on disease susceptibility to their offspring. An indirect effect can also occur, as attempts are made to breed away from a genetically associated disease with individuals being culled, or other, as yet unknown, disease problems being bred into the remaining group.",

Vaccination considerably reduces morbidity and mortality associated with an individual infectious agent, and therefore has a significant impact on improving welfare.

If a protective immunity is achieved within the incubation period of the infection, the individual will show few, if any, clinical signs of disease. It is important to remember that vaccination does not prevent infection, hence vaccinated individuals can excrete the infectious agent, contaminating the environment, and they can also become carriers of the agent. However, in the majority of cases when a vaccinated individual becomes infected the duration and level of excretion of the infectious agent is less, and the environmental contamination is therefore reduced. Thus, indirectly, vaccination will reduce the infectious dose within the group. Vaccination may impact on virulence, as it tends to promote evolution of the infectious agent away from the vaccine strain(s) and this could potentially increase virulence. It is clinical disease, however, that directly affects welfare so vaccination is a positive benefit to the population and to the majority of individuals.",

To some extent vaccine reactions are to be expected, as some sort of response by the individual is necessary in order to stimulate the immune system or the vaccine is unlikely to be efficacious. What is classified as a vaccine reaction is also unclear, as low-grade malaise of less than 24 hours duration is not uncommon but many would not regard this as a vaccine reaction. A crude estimate is that around 3% of vaccinations result in 'significant' vaccine reactions, i.e. a reaction beyond 24 hours of low-grade malaise. The impact on the welfare of the individual, in the majority of cases, is short-lived. Recently, however, vaccination in cats has been linked to the development of vaccine-associated sarcomas (invasive soft tissue tumours) that develop at the site of vaccination, usually in the neck region of the cat. The risk has been calculated to be 1 in 10,000 (0.01%) vaccinations (Hendrick 1999) . The consequences of a vaccine-associated sarcoma are severe and potentially fatal. This has prompted the American Association of Feline Practitioners to recommend that vaccines should be given in the distal limbs of the cat (Levy et al. 2001) , as a limb can be amputated should a sarcoma occur. Further, different vaccines are given at different limb sites in order to try and identify those vaccines associated with the development of sarcomas.",

There are also the effects of a particular infectious agent on the cat population as a whole to be taken into account. Whilst it would be ideal to risk assess each individual, this is rarely possible because so many factors are unknown. This has lead to the concept of 'core' and 'non-core' vaccines. In the United Kingdom, feline parvovirus and the respiratory viruses (feline rhinotracheitis and feline calicivirus) and sometimes feline leukaemia virus are considered core vaccines, while Chlamydophila and Bordetella are non-core and rabies virus vaccine is given according to need, for example if the cat is travelling abroad.",

It is also clear that the duration of immunity following some vaccines, for example parvovirus, is considerably longer than one year depending on the vaccine used and the degree of exposure in the field. This has led to the recommendation that boosters should be given every three years to cats (Levy et al. 2001) . However, clear scientific evidence in support of this approach is lacking. Again, an individual risk assessment, as far as is possible, is the most suitable approach when deciding how often to administer boosters.",

Nevertheless, screening for retroviruses is widespread in veterinary medicine. Depending on the prevalence of infection, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunochromatography testing in healthy individuals will have a false positive rate of between 30 and 50%. Therefore, a cat should not be euthanased on the basis of a single positive test. Sensitivity can be improved by testing 'high-risk' groups where the prevalence of infection should be higher. Traditionally, these groups were thought to be rescue and feral cats; however, a higher prevalence of infection in feral cat populations has not been documented in a number of studies. In many cases, the prevalence of infection appears to be a local phenomenon. Higher false positive rates have also been documented in cats that have been recently vaccinated. Some tests will also give a positive result if the cat has anti-mouse antibodies in its blood or is infected with spumavirus (a related retrovirus). A variety of other methods such as PCR, virus isolation, western blotting or immunofluoresence testing can be used to detect FeLV (Herring et al. 2001) and can be used to confirm a positive ELISA result; alternatively, the screening test can be repeated 6 to 8 weeks later. Discordant results will occur and should be investigated further.

Responsible management would also include keeping the FIV positive cat indoors as far as is practicable, to reduce spread of infection through fighting and biting. Entire adults should be neutered, as this reduces fighting in male cats and the risk of transplacental spread in females.

Even though the prevalence of FCV and FHV-1 are thought to be similar, screening for FHV-1 is insensitive because the virus is sequestered in the trigeminal ganglion in carrier cats and is excreted only intermittently, while FCV tends to be excreted continuously (see section 3.3). With FCV infection, however, there are some cats that shed low numbers of virus and need to be sampled on more than one occasion to accurately demonstrate their status. Under most circumstances there is little justification for screening for FCV, given that a large number of cats will be positive.

Many practices offer annual health checks that are usually combined with vaccination, so that no specific charge for the health check is made. Unfortunately, relatively few cats are presented for annual booster vaccination, particularly as they get older. The other opportunity for health screening is when the cat is brought to the clinic for a specific reason, thereby allowing discussion of more general health issues.",

Physical examination, as a method of health screening, is a standard assessment of an individual but is relatively insensitive in its ability to diagnose occult disease. This has led to the use of other methods to minimise risk and detect disease as early as possible, in particular blood tests (for example prior to anaesthesia). At what age and how frequently an individual should be screened in order to deliver maximum health benefits is unknown. Many screening tests are relatively insensitive; for example, over 75% of renal mass is lost before blood concentrations of urea and creatinine (metabolites excreted by the kidneys) begin to rise. Further, little work has been performed to demonstrate which intervention, and at what stage, would benefit the individual. Before undertaking screening tests, a clear plan for the interpretation of the results and the action to be taken, if results are abnormal, should be established.",

Depending on the experience and training of the professional, history taking and physical examination may lead to a diagnosis.

Many owners are highly observant and pick up very subtle changes that would not be apparent to the veterinary professional that does not have intimate knowledge of the individual cat; these observations should not be disregarded. The health professional's role is to prompt information from the owner by asking questions in a structured way, and to interpret the observations that have been made.

Activity -if asked as a direct question, changes in activity are often not mentioned by owners.

More severe injury usually results in the cat hissing, spitting, becoming aggressive or making vigorous attempts to escape. Following the acute response to major trauma, signs that the cat continues to be in pain become less obvious. Typically, the cat will become withdrawn and immobile; vocalization is rare but the cat will appear tense and distant and may emit occasional low growls. There is significant variation between cats and some will continue to spit and hiss whenever they are approached. A rapid respiratory rate is not uncommon and appears to be a pain response, as respiratory rate will frequently fall following analgesia.

In the majority of cases, continuing pain relief until near normal behaviour returns is appropriate.

As a species they are generally secretive about any form of incapacity, and will attempt to hide the fact that they are not 100% fit by altering their behaviour. Typical signs of chronic pain in cats include reduced activity, hiding, decreased interest and response to surroundings and weight loss due to inappetence (these signs are similar to those of chronic stress; see Chapters 2 and 4). Unfortunately, such signs are non-specific and can be associated with other disease processes where pain is not thought to be a significant feature. Pain can be difficult to localise, either because the cat fails to react when the focus is palpated or because the cat reacts wherever it is touched or handled. Localised pain may be seen as abnormalities of posture or prehension, lameness or stiffness or reluctance to perform a specific activity such as jumping. Chronic long-term pain, such as that caused by degenerative joint disease, is likely to have a more significant impact on the welfare of cats than is currently recognised.",

Because of their unique metabolism and poor ability to glucuronidate drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been avoided in cats due to their perceived toxicity. The use of opioids was considered inappropriate, as hyperexcitability is common in cats given high doses, and individual cats can become excited at relatively low doses too.

However, there remain a large percentage of cats that do not have ready access to veterinary care; in these cats the effects of disease, especially infectious disease, can be severe.
