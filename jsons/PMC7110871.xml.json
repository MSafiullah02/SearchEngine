A systematic diagnostic approach is necessary in these cases to achieve the appropriate diagnosis and formulate an effective treatment plan. In all exotic species, husbandry plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous disease, so a thorough evaluation of the husbandry is critical for successful management. There are vast differences in the structure and function of the skin in exotic species; an understanding of these unique properties is important when treating skin disease in exotic pets. This article focuses on the clinical approach to skin disease in exotic pets including structure and function of the skin, appropriate diagnostic testing, and differential diagnoses for commonly encountered cutaneous diseases.",

The skin of lizards and chelonians shed in several smaller pieces, whereas snakes typically shed their entire skin as one piece.4 Chelonians and crocodilians shed their epidermis continuously, whereas lizards and snakes shed their epidermis periodically.5\n",

Husbandry-related factors often underlie the development of many skin diseases in amphibians. Important questions to consider include recent introductions into the collection; diet; and tank setup including filtration, aeration, water quality, and temperature. During examination, it is important to always handle amphibians with rinsed gloves to avoid damaging their skin and prevent cutaneous absorption of potentially toxic glandular secretions.18, 19, 20 Many amphibian skin diseases can have a similar appearance with cutaneous hyperemia and discoloration, dermal papules and nodules, ulceration, hemorrhages, edema, and excess mucus being the most common findings.21\n",

The cuticle (outermost layer) is approximately 1 \u03bcm thick and contains mucus, sloughed cells, and cellular debris. It has antimicrobial properties mediated by antibodies (IgM), free fatty acids, and lysozymes.30, 31 This layer is commonly referred to as the \u201cslime coat\u201d by aquarium hobbyists because of its high concentration of mucus. This layer is usually lost during routine processing for histopathology. Together with the cuticle, the epidermis produces a waterproof barrier. The epidermis is a nonkeratinizing (most species) stratified squamous epithelium that contains 3 to 20 cell layers.30, 31 It contains many mucus-producing goblet cells and, in some species, club cells that secrete an \u201calarm substance\u201d when the skin is damaged. Unlike mammals, epidermal cells are not keratinized and are capable of mitotic division in all layers; however, division most commonly occurs in cells adjacent to the basement membrane where the epidermis junctions with the dermis.30, 31 The upper dermis contains collagen and reticulin and forms a supportive network; the deeper dermis contains more compact collagen and provides the main structural strength to the skin.30, 31 Scales are flexible bony plates that develop in scale pockets in the dermis; they are not shed regularly.30, 31 As scales emerge they are covered by a layer of epidermis, and often overlap one another, providing structural support and protection. Two main types (ctenoid and cycloid scales) are described that differ in surface sculpture.30, 31 Ultrastructurally, scales contain collagen fibers interspersed with an organic matrix in which hydroxyapatite crystals are deposited.30, 31 Some fish are scaleless and histologically have a thicker epidermis. Chromatophores (pigment cells) are present in the dermis and include melanophores; xanthophores (yellow); erythrophores (orange-red); leucophores (white); and iridophores (reflective/iridescent/silver). The pigments consist mainly of carotenoids. The subcutis contains connective tissue and fat and is highly vascular; bacterial disease can spread rapidly along this layer.30, 31\n",

The coverslip is then placed onto a slide with a drop of tank water. Some fish require sedation for this procedure. Sedation may reduce the number of ectoparasites found on skin scrapings.ii.When there are no obvious lesions on the skin, sites commonly sampled include just caudal to the pectoral fin, operculum, and the ventrum. Samples should be taken from two to three different sites; when possible, several fish should be sampled.\nb.Gill biopsyi.Gill is epithelial tissue and many ectoparasites affect the gills and skin. Occasionally, ectoparasites are found only on the gills.ii.Typically requires sedationiii.The operculum is lifted and a small snip of distal gill lamellae is taken (usually with iris scissors) and placed onto a slide with a drop of tank or pond water to examine.\nc.Skin scrapings and gill biopsies are examined under the microscope; superior results are obtained with the condenser down. Most parasites can be seen on \u00d74 or \u00d710 magnification.

The cells show signs of keratinization in the stratum transitivum.33 Feathers are formed from feather follicles in the dermis.

The calamus can be removed from the feather and contents smeared onto a microscope slide. Possible findings include bacteria, inflammatory cells, viral inclusion bodies, and dermatophytes.\n2.Gross and microscopic examination of feathers32, 33\n\u25cbEvaluate for overall condition, ectoparasites, fret marks and stress bars, evidence of self-trauma\n3.Feather preparation with potassium hydroxide33\n\u25cbTo improve mite identification, the calamus of the feather can be placed into a 10% potassium hydroxide solution, gently heated, and then centrifuged, followed by microscopic examination of the sediment\n4.Acetate tape impressions\u25cbUsed to detect ectoparasites, yeast, and bacterial infections. Feather dander and keratinaceous debris is very abundant on these samples and in some cases can be difficult to differentiate from bacteria and yeast.\n5.Impression smear\u25cbFor moist, exudative, or crusted lesions, direct slide impressions are often used\u25cbFor drier lesions, direct impressions can be attempted but acetate tape impressions may be preferred. Alternatively, a moistened swab can be used to collect a sample and contents rolled onto a slide.\n6.Skin scrapings7.Culture and sensitivity (bacterial, fungal)\u25cbCalamus and feather plucking, sterile tissue biopsy, or superficial swabs\n8.Biopsy\u25cbAvian skin is much thinner than dogs and cats. In some cases, it is easier to biopsy the skin with a scalpel compared with a punch biopsy. If a punch biopsy is to be performed, a technique has been described where acetate tape is placed over the biopsy site to maintain the structure of the skin.35\n\n9.Clinical pathology evaluation including complete blood count and biochemistry panel and heavy metal testing32, 33\n\u25cbSystemic diseases can cause cutaneous changes including feather picking\u25cbTesting for lead and zinc levels may be needed in some cases\n10.Crop washes33\n\u25cbCan identify Trichomonas or Candida, which can present in birds that feather pluck over the crop area\n11.Fecal examination\u25cbCertain intestinal parasites may result in feather plucking32, 33\n\n12.Intradermal allergy testing\u25cbCodeine phosphate at 1:100,000 wt/vol preferred over histamine as a positive control in birds36\n\u25cbFurther research is needed to evaluate appropriate protocols for intradermal allergy testing in pet birds and establish correct allergen dilutions and thresholds\n13.Viral testing including PCR for polyoma virus and psittacine beak and feather disease32, 33\n\n",

Primary hairs are associated with sebaceous glands, apocrine sweat glands, and an arrector pili muscle. Rodents and ferrets have no epitrichial (apocrine) sweat glands.37 Secondary hairs are typically only accompanied by sebaceous glands.37 The rat and mouse tail is very sparsely haired.
