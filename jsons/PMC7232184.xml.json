To date, several cases of viruses were reported in Europe and in the US. The SARS\u2013CoV-2 is strongly infectious, with more than 81,000 infected people and around 3000 deaths reported within three months from the virus appearance (update on 14th of April: more than 1.9 milion of confirmed cases and about 120 thousands deaths reported). The rapid spread of the new virus reveals that the mechanism of diffusion is somehow different from that of Filoviridae, (i.e., Ebolavirus) [1]. The viral pathogenesis results in symptoms like fever, acute pneumonia, and, eventually, respiratory failure. The death rate, the long time needed for a full recovery, and the co-morbidity associated with viral infection (i.e., in advanced age or particular life stages, such as pregnancy) result in a major threat to global health [2].",

Furthermore, computational chemistry represents a fundamental tool in the screening of applicable drugs [5]. The computational approach can also represent a tool for physicians and healthcare professionals to operate a first decision on the best therapy to administrate at first instance.",

Thirteen proteinase inhibitors from anti-HIV and anti-HCV drugs were investigated, along with three different compounds for spike protein inhibition. Despite the different viral strains for which these drugs were originally developed, we aim to investigate whether they could also have an affinity for the SARS\u2013CoV-2. The use of antivirals that are already available in the therapy against the new virus would be a huge advantage in the fight of this battle, and a first step can eventually arise from bioinformatic analysis, which could provide information about their potential effectiveness. Indeed, our in silico data suggest that an effective interaction occurs for some of the tested molecules.",

Most of these residues are distant from the protease active site and are unlikely related to selectivity against this protease (Figure 1a). Nonetheless, two of these mutations, Lys180Asn and Ala46Ser, are located in the deep hydrophobic pocket below the active site and in the loop region flanking the entrance of the active site. Although in the available crystallographic structure, Lys180Asn results to be located too far to directly contribute to ligand binding, its presence extends the hydrophobic inner region. Conversely, the Ser46 seems to be relatively distant from the His41 active site (11 \u00c5) and may have a role in ligand recruitment (Figure 1b). ",

While very useful to identify the residues involved in the inhibitory action, this configuration is not very well suited for molecular docking as it may limit the effectiveness of the pose searching methods. For this reason, we preferred to model the three-dimensional structure of the protease using a homology modeling protocol, excluding the complexed covid-19 protease among the target structures. The structure obtained from the iTasser server showed a very good alignment score (TM-score 0.993) against the apo structure of SARS\u2013CoV main protease (PDB ID: 5B6O). Interestingly, the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of the model structure from the available crystallographic structure SARS\u2013CoV-2 protease is as low as 1.3 \u00c5, and it is mostly due to differences in the binding pocket and loop conformations. The main results obtained from the docking protocol are shown in Table 1. Protease drug recognitions are usually driven by hydrophobic interactions [24,25], and Figure 2 clearly shows how all the four best scoring ligands indeed thoroughly fill the hydrophobic pockets that flank the catalytic dyad.",

This pose induces the opening of the catalytic dyad. Indeed, His41-Cys145 changes from 3 \u00c5, in the apo configuration, to 7.3 \u00c5 in the inhibited form. Simeprevir binding to SARS\u2013CoV-2 protease is also sustained by three hydrogen bonds that anchor the ligand to the binding pocket: two of them link the amide backbone of Glu166 and Gly143 to the carbonyl O in the macrocycle and to the acyl sulfonamide cyclopropyl moiety, respectively. A third hydrogen bond is formed between the N of the Asn142 side chain and the ether group. A detailed structural representation of the interacting residues is shown in Figure 3a. These findings may appear rather surprising, as the HCV main protease shares very low similarity with the SARS\u2013CoV-2 homolog (7.5%).

Unfortunately, a thorough direct comparison of our model structure with these experimental data is impaired by the different global configuration of the two trimeric structures (\u201cdown\u201d-inactive vs. \u201cup\u201d-active conformations). However, as the experimental structure shows only one monomer in the \u201cup\u201d-state, a comparison can be performed in a monomer-based manner. The RMSD between \u201cdown\u201d-state monomers in the two structures is as low as 1.17 \u00c5 for residues with the same secondary structure assignments and 6 \u00c5 overall. It is worth noting here that in the pre-fusion state, the \u201cdown\u201d inactive conformation is significantly more stable than the \u201cup\u201d-conformations [30,31,32].
