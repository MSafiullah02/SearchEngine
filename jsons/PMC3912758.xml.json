Before we elaborate on this point we should be clear about the concept of \u2018etiology\u2019. As defined in the Merriam\u2010Webster dictionary (Merriam\u2010Webster.com), etiology is \u2018the cause or causes of a disease or abnormal condition\u2019. Therefore, by characterizing bacteria as the etiological agents of periodontal diseases, we are stating that they cause these diseases. Let us elaborate further on the definition of cause. Rothman & Greenland (297) defined cause as \u2018an antecedent event, condition, or characteristic that was necessary for the occurrence of the disease at the moment it occurred, given that other conditions are fixed\u2019. By this definition, it becomes clear that bacteria are not sufficient to cause periodontal diseases; in fact, Rothman & Greenland (297) stressed that \u2018no specific event, condition, or characteristic is sufficient by itself to produce disease\u2019. They went on to describe \u2018sufficient cause\u2019 as the constellation of minimal conditions and events that produce disease. Implicit in the word \u2018minimal\u2019 is the idea that all the conditions and events are essential for disease to occur. Onset of disease will occur when all minimal conditions of the sufficient cause have taken place.",

            "text": "These concepts agree with our understanding of periodontal diseases as multifactorial diseases. In 1994, Haffajee & Socransky (131) argued that periodontal disease initiation and progression required the simultaneous occurrence of a number of factors: (i) the virulent periodontal pathogen (we will elaborate further on this concept later; for now this would be equivalent to bacteria); (ii) the local environment; and (iii) host susceptibility. Indeed, the notion that variation in \u2018host resistance\u2019 impacts the outcome of periodontal diseases has been recognized since at least the 1970s (332). Later, Page & Kornman (266) expanded this model to acknowledge the contributions of genetic and acquired risk factors. The concept of multiple causes is clearly not unique to periodontal diseases; although tobacco smoking is well accepted as a cause of lung cancer, it is also clear that by itself it is not a sufficient cause. The requirement of susceptibility of the host for the development of periodontal diseases has led some to refer to bacteria as a condition \u2018required but not sufficient\u2019 to cause periodontal diseases. This is a moot point because no disease process is the result of a single isolated cause or event (i.e. no cause is necessary and sufficient in itself to produce disease). Furthermore, for any given infection, if disease is to result from a host\u2013microbe interaction, the host has to be susceptible. This causal model can also accommodate variations in the dose of each component in the constellation of sufficient causes. The model described above for sufficient causes for periodontal tissue destruction (bacteria, local environment and host susceptibility) can easily accommodate the notion of varying doses. For instance, if a susceptible host has an immunodeficiency, a lower bacterial challenge might be enough to complete the minimal conditions that result in periodontal disease.",

According to this concept, observational epidemiology should serve as the basis for hypotheses of causality, which would then be tested using laboratory experiments and human clinical trials. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and case\u2013control studies are examples of high\u2010level evidence, while case\u2010series, biological plausibility, \u2018pathophysiological reasoning\u2019, animal studies, bench research and expert opinion are characterized as low\u2010level evidence. The experimental gingivitis classical study performed by L\u00f6e et al. (213) was cited as an example of \u2018low\u2010level\u2019 evidence that infection leads to destructive periodontal disease. It was argued that the study was flawed because it had a small sample size of 12 subjects, used an acute model to make inferences on a chronic disease and the findings were extrapolated to periodontitis that, according to the author, was \u2018a huge leap\u2019. This is not the first time that the infectious nature of periodontal diseases has been put into question and is a good example of the vicious cycle of \u2018lessons learned and unlearned\u2019 in periodontal microbiology. As described by Socransky & Haffajee in their paper on the historical perspective of the bacterial etiology of periodontal diseases, between the mid\u20101920s and the early 1960s, periodontal diseases were considered to be the result of some constitutional defect on the part of the patient, trauma from occlusion, disuse atrophy or some combination of those factors (335). Additional theories proposed in the past included local irritation from calculus, rough restoration margins, systemic diseases and conditions, diet and nutritional deficiencies (269).",

Therefore, at least for gingivitis, the infectious theory of causation did follow the so\u2010called epidemiological baton. The classical studies on experimental gingivitis were pioneers in the sense that, for the first time, the reversal phase of gingival inflammation was closely observed after subjects resumed their oral\u2010hygiene practices. This satisfies the condition of \u2018experimental evidence\u2019, as described by Hill in 1965 (152) in his list of considerations on the determination of causality, or the criterion of \u2018elimination\u2019, according to the criteria of Haffajee & Socransky for defining periodontal pathogens (131), regarding the cause\u2013effect relationship between dental plaque and gingivitis. Since its description, \u2018experimental gingivitis\u2019 has become a standard model for examining the effects of different antiplaque agents and in the study of risk factors for the development of gingivitis and therefore has been reproduced hundreds of times. In fact, in 1971, L\u00f6e (210) reported that up to that time 150 students had already participated in several studies conducted by his group using the experimental gingivitis model. The criticism that the model has an acute onset quite distinct from the chronic nature of gingivitis is valid. However, human studies have documented the resolution and prevention of recurrence of naturally occurring gingivitis following mechanical plaque removal, similar to the observations by L\u00f6e and co\u2010authors using the acute model (25, 196, 223, 351).",

Therefore, as dental\u2010plaque accumulation correlated with gingival inflammation, its association with periodontal tissue destruction was a logical extension. In addition, an experimental periodontitis study in beagle dogs demonstrated that plaque accumulation could also lead to periodontitis, at least in an animal model (206). Indirect evidence for a role of plaque accumulation and periodontitis has also been provided by studies demonstrating that meticulous supragingival plaque control can arrest the progression of destructive periodontal diseases for prolonged periods of time (23, 24, 26, 27, 351). The concept that gingivitis would inevitably result in attachment loss was eventually challenged by additional epidemiological studies demonstrating that a subset of individuals would not develop periodontitis even after years of exposure to large amounts of plaque accumulation and long\u2010standing gingivitis (212). In any case, the original experimental gingivitis studies have been presented in the periodontal literature as evidence of a cause\u2010and\u2010effect relationship between dental plaque and gingivitis, but not between dental plaque and periodontitis.",

            "text": "Studies that evaluated the predictive value of clinical parameters for disease progression failed to identify dental plaque accumulation as a strong risk factor for attachment loss (28, 56, 161, 211). This finding suggested a less robust association between dental plaque accumulation and attachment loss compared with the association between dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis, casting doubt on the theory of the infectious nature of periodontitis. This apparent disconnect between plaque accumulation and periodontal tissue destruction can be partially explained by examining further the precision (or lack thereof) of existing methods to measure the amount of bacterial challenge (we will address differences in the nature of the bacterial challenge later in the text). The limitations of the many plaque indices that have been employed in epidemiological surveys are notorious. First, plaque accumulation varies within a period of hours and therefore the same subject can have dramatically different plaque\u2010accumulation scores depending on the time of the day when the measurements are taken (237). Indices of gingival inflammation have been proposed as a better assessment of the consistency of the individual\u2019s oral\u2010hygiene practices because they would reflect exposure of plaque over time. Still, the inflammatory gingival status of a subject also fluctuates over relatively brief periods of time (days), depending on the efficacy and consistency of the oral\u2010hygiene practices performed by the subject. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect that cross\u2010sectional measures of plaque accumulation, even when repeated a few times, would give a very accurate assessment of the long\u2010term exposure to the bacterial challenge. This is particularly relevant if one considers the chronic nature of periodontal diseases and the lengthy time required for attachment loss to occur.",

Data from a recent longitudinal study that followed a cohort of 223 Norwegian subjects over 26 years have clearly demonstrated that long\u2010term, constant exposure to gingivitis was a risk factor for attachment loss and tooth loss (313, 314). A recently published paper examined the oral condition of subjects from New Zealand over a time period of 32 years (43). The study population initially comprised 1,037 children. Oral examinations were repeated at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26 and 35 years. Data for at least four time points, including the baseline and the last visit, were available for 911 subjects. Plaque scores were assessed using Greene and Vermillion\u2019s Simplified Oral Hygiene Index, and patterns of \u2018lifetime plaque exposure\u2019 were determined using group\u2010based trajectory modeling. Three subgroups were characterized, according to their \u2018trends\u2019 in plaque exposure over the years, as high, medium and low trajectories. Periodontal disease parameters were measured in 897 subjects at age 32 years. Using this approach the authors could examine the potential role of the cumulative exposure to dental plaque over many years as a risk factor for periodontal disease initiation and progression. The results from multivariate models indicated that higher \u2018plaque trajectories\u2019 were indeed associated with poorer oral\u2010health outcomes, including caries\u2010 and periodontal disease\u2010related measurements. These outcomes were present even after adjusting for confounding variables such as childhood socio\u2010economic status, gender, dental\u2010visit patterns and smoking. In summary, the failure of early epidemiological studies to detect a close correlation between plaque accumulation and periodontal disease occurrence and progression might have been a result of the imprecise measurement of exposure to the bacterial challenge. The effect of long\u2010term exposure to other well\u2010established risk factors for periodontal disease progression, such as cigarette smoking, can be better estimated through, for instance, the use of questionnaires. Unfortunately, one cannot estimate, using questionnaires, how many \u2018plaque\u2010years\u2019 a subject has been exposed to.",

Since then, clinical trials continue to indicate that the adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics, particularly the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole, result in significant improvements over the clinical results obtained with mechanical therapy alone (54, 90, 125, 135, 151, 232, 240, 245, 385). These results are compelling evidence of the bacterial etiology of periodontal diseases, particularly because these agents, in contrast to other classes of antibiotics (153), have no known anti\u2010inflammatory effects. Even more persuasive was the report by Lopez and colleagues (220), on the outcome of a randomized placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial carried out to examine the clinical effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole as the sole therapy for chronic periodontitis. Patients were examined every 2 months for 12 months to detect periodontal disease progression by changes in clinical attachment level. The antibiotic regimen (amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg, three times daily for 7 days) was administered at baseline, and at 4 and 8 months. The antibiotics group had statistically significantly better clinical outcomes at all 2\u2010month intervals, including a lower percentage of progressing sites. Periodontal sites that exhibited multiple cycles of disease progression and periodontal abscesses were detected only in the placebo group. This study was followed by another clinical trial that examined the clinical and microbiological effects of a single regimen of this systemic antimicrobial combination as the sole therapy. It was demonstrated that the clinical improvements were accompanied by statistically significant reductions in most of the 40 species investigated using checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (221). These intervention studies provided additional support to the bacterial etiology of periodontitis; furthermore, they indicated that live bacteria, rather than the mere presence of their constituents, are key elements in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.",

In addition, cases of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and localized juvenile periodontites (now known as localized aggressive periodontitis), where clinically distinct periodontal diseases were associated with distinctly different subgingival microbiotas, also helped create momentum for the reintroduction of the specific plaque hypothesis. Particularly, cases of localized aggressive periodontitis, where very little plaque accumulation and clinical signs of gingival inflammation were accompanied by severe connective tissue destruction and bone loss, challenged the notion that the mass of bacterial plaque was the key element. The accepted dogma became that specific microorganisms were associated with different periodontal diseases and hence several groups embarked on the search for the periodontal pathogens responsible for different periodontal conditions (87, 88, 132, 244, 246, 329, 334, 338, 340, 378). We referred to these historic events as being responsible for the reintroduction of the notion of specificity in periodontal infections because, as pointed out by Socransky & Haffajee in 1994 (335), scientists started to look for the etiological agents of periodontal diseases in the 1880s. It was not until the mid\u20101930s that the search for the microorganisms responsible for destructive periodontal diseases was interrupted.

Out of this hard work, several putative periodontal pathogens were identified, culminating with the designation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (currently Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia as periodontal pathogens in the 1996 World Workshop in Periodontics (2). These efforts are still ongoing and will probably require a few decades of intense research before we have identified all periodontal pathogens or combinations of pathogens that can lead to periodontal destruction. Difficulties in determining the role of specific components in the subgingival microbiota include: (i) the diversity of microbial taxa that can be found in the subgingival environment, many of which are still unculturable; (ii) difficulties in obtaining a representative sample; (iii) the identification of active sites that are undergoing tissue destruction; and (iv) the understanding that periodontal diseases are mixed infections with many combinations of \u2018pathogens\u2019 that can lead to disease. In 1994, Haffajee & Socransky (131) summarized a set of criteria that helped to define subgingival bacterial species as periodontal pathogens. The criteria included: association; elimination; host response; virulence factor; animal studies; and risk assessment. Much of our current understanding of the potential role of different species as etiological agents of periodontal diseases comes from data obtained using molecular techniques that overcame many of the limitations of culture techniques. However, out of the six criteria listed by Haffajee & Socransky, only three (association, elimination and risk assessment) can be fulfilled using molecular techniques alone. Furthermore, different clonal types of the same species might have distinct pathogenic potentials, and the existing techniques used in the study of virulent strains of the same species, such as multiple locus sequence typing and comparative genomic hybridization, require culture. Therefore, if we are to fully examine the pathogenic potential of yet\u2010uncultured species, methods to grow them in the laboratory will have to be in place.",

The concept refers to the requirement that the cause precedes the effect in time. Therefore, if one postulates that P. gingivalis causes periodontal tissue destruction, there should be evidence of its presence before the detection of attachment loss or bone loss. Several studies have tried to establish temporality in an effort to implicate specific bacterial species in the etiology of periodontal diseases, and mixed results were obained (87, 98, 137, 138, 322, 353, 354). Still, it can be argued, based on the studies by Fine et al. (99), that the criterion of temporality can be used in support of an etiological role for A. actinomycetemcomitans in cases of localized aggressive periodontitis. At times, it has been argued that the increased levels and proportions of certain species in diseased sites occur as a consequence of the environmental changes resulting from the disease process. Although this might well be the case, one must bear in mind that the detection of increased levels of putative periodontal pathogens after tissue destruction has occurred is not evidence against its pathogenic role. In addition, there is also the possibility that in other circumstances the same species might cause periodontal tissue destruction, or that it might be responsible for further destruction at a later time (297).",

Current models of periodontal disease progression posit that tissue destruction progresses through periods of acute exacerbations (activity) followed by periods of remission (120, 130, 133, 134). At any given time, different sites in an individual\u2019s mouth might be at different stages of disease progression. Clinically, the only way of determining that a periodontal site has undergone periodontal disease progression is by measuring longitudinal changes in the clinical attachment level. This implies that in order to determine disease activity, longitudinal monitoring at close time intervals is required. This has been the approach used by many investigators in the past in order to assess risk factors for periodontal disease initiation and progression (133). Typically, study subjects are monitored clinically every 2 months, bacterial samples are collected at baseline and when disease progression is diagnosed, and the microbial composition of the subgingival microbiota is examined to determine species potentially involved in disease progression (87). A limitation of early studies was the low throughput of existing microbiological techniques, which restricted the number of samples that could be conveniently collected and processed. Nevertheless, these studies have helped to implicate several subgingival species in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.",

If a sudden change in the composition of the subgingival microbiota triggers a cascade of events (e.g. the appropriate immuno\u2010inflammatory response) that eventually lead to tissue destruction of the magnitude that can be detected as changes in clinical attachment level, one still needs to determine the induction period linking the two events. As of now, we have no concept of the length of time that separates changes in the subgingival microbiota and periodontal tissue destruction (assuming that these two events are linked). This simple consideration complicates considerably the determination if any given event satisfies the condition of temporality proposed by Hill (152).

The terms \u2018initiator\u2019 and \u2018promoter\u2019 have been used in carcinogenesis to describe component causes of cancer that act early or late in the causal mechanism (297). In the context of periodontitis, bacteria could be described as the initiator and the inflammatory response as the promoter. This is an obvious oversimplification as the immuno\u2010inflammatory response by the host encompasses many mechanisms that might be required for tissue destruction to occur, each one with its own induction time. For instance, the mechanisms involved in the early lesion described by Page & Schroeder (268) can also be thought of as initiators, while the final mechanisms that result in bone resorption (such as activation of osteoclasts) might be defined as promoters. Owing to the chronic nature of periodontal diseases, one might anticipate that early initiators (bacteria are most likely in this category) might have long induction periods of months or years. It is likely that the longitudinal monitoring of periodontal diseases has a better chance of identifying promoters with a short induction time (i.e. mechanisms that occur later in the chain of events that lead to periodontal tissue destruction).",

The hypothesis was based primarily on association studies that demonstrated an increase in the load of Epstein\u2013Barr virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses in sites and in subjects with periodontal diseases compared with subjects with gingivitis and periodontally healthy controls. This hypothesis posits that subgingival bacteria and viruses infecting the adjacent periodontal tissues would form a pathogenic consortium (327). In fact, synergy between viruses and bacteria has been demonstrated in several clinically relevant infections, including: respiratory infections (influenza\u2010associated pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha\u2010hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis); acute otitis media (rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses associated with H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis or Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species); bacterial sinusitis following viral colds; pharyngotonsillitis (Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u2010induced overgrowth of P. intermedia and F. nucleatum); and gastroenteritis (associated with rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, astrovirus and bacterial taxa such as E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter jejuni) (326). In a mouse model, co\u2010infection with murine cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis resulted in a significantly higher rate of mortality compared with mice monoinfected with either pathogen alone (346). Early models of combined viral\u2013bacterial synergistic infections proposed primarily that the polymicrobial infection would enhance the virulence of bacteria or decrease their clearance. However, recent studies have suggested that this co\u2010infection could also enhance the pathogenicity of the virus. For instance, P. gingivalis sonicate can reactivate Epstein\u2013Barr virus (347). Interestingly, Barton et al. (32) reported results suggesting that herpesvirus latency can confer symbiotic protection against bacterial infections. In a mouse model, latent infection with murine gammaherpesvirus or murine cytomegalovirus provided resistance to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis owing to an elevation in the expression of interferon gamma and to macrophage activation.",

It has been demonstrated that herpesviruses can produce virus\u2010derived homologues of the anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine, interleukin\u201010 (204), and other inhibitors of a T\u2010helper 1 cell response (330). In animal models, cytomegalovirus can impair neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, the oxidative burst and intracellular killing capacity (5). Periodontitis subjects with subgingival herpesviruses had reduced neutrophil chemotaxis and bactericidal activity compared with herpesvirus\u2010free individuals (326). Herpesviruses can also interfere with the antibacterial functions of macrophages and the complement system (205, 214). In addition, human cytomegalovirus IL\u201010 can suppress the transcription of tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha and interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (250). Alternatively, viruses might induce the release of catabolic inflammatory mediators or other immunopathological mechanisms, causing indirect damage to periodontal tissues. For instance, herpesvirus reactivation induces a major increase in the numbers of cytotoxic T\u2010cells and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (243). Herpesviruses were shown to induce collagen degradation in an in\u2010vitro system (40). In fact, several of the features of periodontal disease pathogenesis can potentially be explained by viral infections. For instance, the conversion of a gingivitis lesion to a periodontitis lesion and of a stable lesion to a progressing one could reflect cycles of activity and latency in herpesvirus infection of the periodontium (324). Herpesvirus reactivation can be triggered by many immunosuppressing factors that have also been implicated as risk factors or risk indicators for periodontal infections (328). In addition, the localized nature of the periodontal lesions could be associated with the tissue tropism of herpesvirus infections, while absence of viral infection or latency of the infection might help explain the presence of periodontal pathogens in periodontally healthy tissues and in stable periodontal lesions (62).",

Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u20101, human cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses have been detected at high frequency and high levels in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis, chronic periodontitis and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (328). It is noteworthy that the elevated frequency of detection of herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions from subjects with gingivitis compared with periodontally healthy subjects has been reported by studies examining samples from different geographic locations (40, 47, 48, 160, 179, 311, 350, 401). Sites with active periodontitis also carry significantly higher numbers of lymphocytes with latent viruses than do stable sites (409). Viral DNA has been detected not only in subgingival plaque samples (401) and in gingival crevicular fluid samples (40), but also in samples from the adjacent inflamed periodontal pocket wall (185) and in surgically removed inflamed periodontal tissues (61). Periodontal lesions infected with Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u20101, human cytomegalovirus, or both, also harbored elevated levels of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, Dialister pneumosintes, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, C. rectus, T. denticola and A. actinomycetemcomitans (63, 169, 310, 311, 325). The human cytomegalovirus and Epstein\u2013Barr virus counts correlated positively with clinical parameters of periodontal disease, such as clinical attachment level, pocket depth and bleeding on probing (311). B\u2010lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages in periodontal lesions can be infected with Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u20101, and T\u2010lymphocytes present in periodontal lesions can be infected with human cytomegalovirus (62, 63). Intervention studies have demonstrated that periodontal mechanical therapy can reduce the levels of herpesviruses (123, 309) and that human cytomegalovirus seems to be particularly susceptible to the effects of periodontal therapy (298). The reduction in the amount of inflammatory infiltrate in the adjacent periodontal tissues might result in lower numbers of infected immune cells (326). Sunde et al. (350) reported on the treatment of a subject with refractory periodontitis, who exhibited high levels of subgingival Epstein\u2013Barr virus, using the antiviral drug valacyclovir\u2010HCl, 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. The therapy resulted in the suppression of Epstein\u2013Barr virus for up to 1 year and resulted in a significant clinical improvement with reductions in pocket depth and bleeding on probing.",

Individuals seropositive for human T lymphotropic virus\u20101 had significantly higher levels of interleukin\u20101\u03b2, and interferon\u2010\u03b3 mRNA, elevated expression of interleukin\u201012 and of interleukin\u201017, and similar levels of expression of tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha and interleukin\u20104 compared with seronegative subjects.

They noted that several viruses can be present and replicate in human cells without causing disease symptoms, and cautioned against the clinical relevance of the presence of viruses in periodontal lesions and their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal infections. Furthermore, they suggested that evidence of active viral infection, such as the presence of high levels of viral particles and/or the detection of cells producing viral RNA or protein, would provide better support for a role of viruses in the etiology of periodontal diseases. In this context, significantly more herpesvirus genomic copies are found in progressive and untreated periodontal lesions than in stable or treated periodontitis sites (up to 8.3 \u00d7 108 Epstein\u2013Barr virus copies and 4.6 \u00d7 105 human cytomegalovirus DNA copies in samples of individual periodontal pockets), suggesting possible active replication.

It is now recognized that more than 65% of all bacterial infections in humans are associated with biofilms (201) and it is estimated that <0.1% of the total microbial biomass lives in the planktonic mode of growth (37). Biofilms are characterized by heterogeneous microenvironments within their structure, determined by the gradients of nutrients, oxygen and metabolic waste that provide growth conditions for multiple species and different strains of the same species with distinct phenotypic traits (36). The specialization of subpopulations within the biofilm structure, the so\u2010called \u2018division of labour\u2019 (15), has also been described as a common feature of the biofilm mode of growth (36).

Early descriptions of different stages in dental plaque development and maturation on tooth surfaces were detailed by studies using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. For instance, the notion that dental biofilms grow by lateral spread, followed by a gain in thickness as a consequence of the multiplication of early colonizers, comes from those pioneer studies. Competition for space and nutrients, aggregation of bacteria from different species and the columnar pattern of microbial colonies in mature supragingival plaque (with filamentous bacteria perpendicular to the tooth surface) were features readily recognized. Those early studies also demonstrated how certain bacterial species tend to thrive under specific environmental conditions and become organized into communities, giving supragingival and subgingival biofilms their unique structural characteristics.

This notion also calls into question the role of certain species in the pathogenesis of chronic biofilm infections, such as periodontal diseases. In other words, it challenges the paradigm of the specific plaque hypothesis. The concomitant activity of many species that compose the subgingival biofilm would be required to induce disease in what was described by van Steenbergen et al. (381) as \u2018pathogenic synergy\u2019, a concept akin to the mixed\u2010infection concept of the 1970s.

Despite the relevance of the biofilm as a whole to the periodontal disease process, it is also clear that neither all compositions of the subgingival microbiota result in tissue destruction, nor all elements of a pathogenic biofilm have the same significance to the disease process. For instance, supragingival and subgingival plaques are considered a continuum; however, at a certain point during biofilm maturation the subgingival habitat seems to become isolated from the supragingival environment. The independence between these two ecosystems is such that, at least in deep pockets, consistent removal of supragingival plaque has a minimal impact on the composition of the subgingival biofilm and, more importantly, on its capacity to sustain periodontal disease (364). This observation suggests that, after a certain point in its development, the subgingival microbiota no longer depends on bacterial species from the supragingival biofilm for its survival and pathogenicity. Preliminary data comparing the transcriptomic profile from healthy\u2010associated biofilms with that of disease\u2010associated biofilms indicate that putative periodontal pathogens seem to be more \u2018active\u2019 in diseased than in healthy\u2010associated microbial communities. In summary, the understanding of periodontal diseases as infections caused by a microbial community is not necessarily novel and was already incorporated in our appreciation of periodontal diseases as polymicrobial infections.

In fact, the protection granted by the biofilm mode of growth to the subgingival microbiota does not render them immune to the effects of systemic antibiotics, as demonstrated by the observation of beneficial clinical and microbiological effects after their use as sole therapy in periodontitis cases (221). It has been recently postulated that the presence of a subset of persister cells within the biofilm community is the main mechanism that guarantees their survival after exposure to antibiotics. These cells are dormant cells with a low level of translation (319), which protect them from antibiotics that require cell replication to work. Persisters are considered as phenotypic variants rather than as mutants and have similar levels of tolerance to antibiotics compared with the wild\u2010type strain. These rare, nongrowing cells pre\u2010exist in the bacterial population and are not induced by antibiotic administration; however, they can survive exposure to these drugs and help reconstitute the biofilm after discontinuation of the antimicrobial regimen. If the presence of persisters is confirmed in subgingival biofilms, strategies to kill these dormant cells, such as the use of metabolic stimuli to potentiate antibiotics (e.g. mannitol, glucose, fructose and pyruvate) (12); newer beta\u2010lactam agents (e.g. cephalosporins and carbapenems), aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones that can kill nongrowing bacteria (74); drugs that can target proteins that are essential for the maintenance of persisters (e.g. glycerol\u20103\u2010phosphate acyltransferase) (200); and tryptophan/arginine\u2010containing antimicrobial peptides (52), might become attractive adjuncts for the treatment of periodontal infections. Interestingly, persisters can be readily killed by antiseptics, but their use in most infections is precluded by the toxic systemic effects of these compounds. However, in the case of periodontal diseases, a simple strategy could be devised where the regimen of systemic antibiotics would be followed by the local application of antiseptics, such as povidone\u2010iodine or chlorhexidine, to the base of the residual pockets.",

(136) explored, using cluster analysis and community ordination techniques, microbial complexes present in mature biofilms, 1\u2010 to 7\u2010day\u2010old biofilms and long\u2010term redevelopment biofilms (i.e. sampled 3\u201324 months after periodontal therapy). The results demonstrated that the community structure of the mature and long\u2010term regrowth biofilms was quite similar (2, 3), whereas the recently formed biofilms were a mixture of communities observed in the more mature biofilms. The typical complexes that formed in long\u2010standing biofilms could not be identified, indicating that 7 days was probably not a sufficient time for the establishment of a climax community with late colonizers. Complexes of mainly Streptococcus (yellow complex) and Actinomyces species, similar to those described for subgingival biofilms (337), could be identified. For the other complexes (i.e. green, purple, orange and red), there were a few noticeable differences from the composition of those described for the subgingival biofilms. Capnocytophaga ochracea appeared to be associated more with members of the orange complex than with members of the green complex, while V. parvula and N. mucosa appeared to comprise a new \u2018purple\u2019 complex in which N. mucosa replaced Actinomyces odontolyticus. However, in the long\u2010term redevelopment analyses, N. mucosa and, to a lesser extent, V. parvula, appeared to join the green complex. The largest complex observed in the supragingival samples in terms of number of species was once more the orange complex; however, there were distinct subsets within this community. For instance, Campylobacter gracilis, Selenomonas noxia and C. ochracea formed a close subset within the orange complex, while P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and certain fusobacteria formed additional distinct subsets within this larger complex. C. rectus and Campylobacter showae were closely related, possibly because of their similar nutrient requirements. The subsets within the orange complex of supragingival biofilms seemed to be more closely associated compared with subsets observed in subgingival samples. Interestingly, the core red\u2010complex species \u2013P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and T. denticola\u2013 were joined by E. nodatum in supragingival plaque in both the mature and the long\u2010term redevelopment biofilms. There was also a loose association of red\u2010complex species with A. actinomycetemcomitans, Eubacterium saburreum, P. micra and P. melaninogenica in the long\u2010term redevelopment biofilms.",

Sites with bleeding on probing or redness were strongly associated with members of the orange and red complexes, in accordance with findings for the subgingival biofilms. Interestingly, there was also a close association between the levels of orange\u2010complex and red\u2010complex species in supragingival plaque samples with pocket depth. This association was true, even when accounting for the presence of clinical signs of inflammation. It is possible that the higher levels of these species in deeper periodontal pockets and a higher flow of gingival crevicular fluid associated with them might impact the supragingival microbiota by providing a source of cells for recolonization and of nutrients for plaque regrowth. These results suggest that periodontal pocket reduction after therapy might reduce the rate of supragingival plaque accumulation, particularly of species of the orange and red complexes. The presence of gingival recessions also seemed to enhance the accumulation of supragingival biofilm and to favor certain species, such as E. corrodens and, to a lesser extent, C. ochracea and C. gingivalis. This was possibly because of an increased surface area for plaque retention or differential adherence of specific species to cementum and/or dentin.",

Interestingly, the proportion of red\u2010complex species in supragingival biofilms did not seem to be impacted by plaque biomass. Confirming their previous observations, the presence of gingival inflammation and deep pockets in the tissues adjacent to the sampled site correlated with an increased mass of biofilm. When the relationship between tooth position and biofilm mass and composition was investigated, it became apparent that the mean bacterial counts were higher at upper and lower molar sites, as well as at lower incisor/canine sites (Fig. 5). Plaque composition was influenced by tooth position, even after adjusting for total DNA probe counts, periodontal status, smoking, age and gender. For instance, multiple linear regression demonstrated a positive association between the proportions of C. gingivalis and Streptococcus sanguinis with lower incisor/canine teeth, while Actinomyces naeslundii 2 (currently A. oris) had a positive association with upper incisor/canine teeth and a negative correlation with lower molars.",

This was demonstrated in recent publications that have examined the composition and development patterns of biofilms that formed on denture teeth compared with natural teeth (299, 360). Teles et al. (360) found that the rate of biofilm redevelopment on natural teeth was far more rapid than on denture teeth and reasoned that this observation could be partially explained by differences in the physical and chemical properties of hydroxyapatite compared with acrylic (Fig. 6). However, previous in\u2010vivo studies have shown that protein adsorption to surfaces and bacterial adherence are mostly determined by surface roughness rather than by other physicochemical properties of those surfaces (283, 284, 320, 366). With increased roughness more plaque was accumulated and the complexity of the composition of these biofilms also seemed to increase, with higher proportions of rods, motile organisms and spirochetes (366). Based on surface roughness, it was anticipated that the rate of biofilm regrowth would be faster on denture teeth than on natural teeth. Therefore, other factors unique to natural teeth might have contributed to the differences in plaque redevelopment. Another important difference between these two ecosystems is the presence of the gingival crevicular fluid that bathed the crevice of natural teeth but was absent on dentures, suggesting that this extra source of nutrients might have helped the faster biofilm growth observed on natural teeth. Furthermore, the proliferation of bacterial cells located in the subgingival habitat might also have contributed to a faster rate of plaque development and a more complex biofilm on natural teeth.",

These findings were in accordance with data from other studies that used culture techniques (348, 367), checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (73) and cloning and sequencing (45) to examine the microbiota associated with dentures that also reported high levels of streptococci.

The fast\u2010accumulating species that have been associated with increases in plaque mass, such as E. corrodens and C. gracilis, and the bridging species of fusobacteria might have fostered the faster development of a more complex biofilm in dentate individuals compared with edentulous subjects.

When the kinetics of biofilm accumulation was examined, it was noticed that there was a marked increase in biofilm species counts between 0 and 2 days; a plateau in counts between 2 and 4 days; and then a second sharp increase between 4 and 7 days (Fig. 7). These phases in subgingival biofilm redevelopment might represent a change in the environment induced by the bacterial species that grew in the first wave. The first wave of growth, from 0 to 2 days, was associated with a sharp increase in the levels of members of the Actinomyces, purple and green complexes, while the second wave of growth, from 4 to 7 days, was characterized by a sharp increase in the levels of orange\u2010complex species.

The faster redevelopment of subgingival biofilms in periodontitis subjects than in periodontally healthy subjects might be explained by a larger source of nutrients provided by the elevated flow of gingival crevicular fluid and a greater number of residual cells left within periodontal pockets after mechanical debridement that could contribute to the repopulation of that environment.",

Subjects had their periodontal parameters measured at four time points: baseline, and 1, 2 and 3 years after therapy.

The levels of 40 subgingival species measured using checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization were averaged within subjects, across subjects and then across the different visits within each site category separately, in order to obtain a summary measure of cumulative exposure to these taxa over time.

For instance, this hypothesis posits that the long\u2010term stability of the clinical improvements obtained with any periodontal therapy will only be sustainable if the ecological changes that led to disease onset are prevented. If the maturation of the disease\u2010associated subgingival climax community can be retarded, initiation or recurrence of periodontal tissue destruction could be averted. A long\u2010held misconception in the field of periodontal microbiology is that recolonization of the subgingival habitat occurs fast (within weeks), resulting in the need for continuous reinstrumentation to maintain the results obtained with therapy (226, 247, 312). As discussed above, data generated in the past decade on the study of periodontal microbial ecology have challenged this notion (364). It is clear that the maturation of the subgingival microbiota to its peak complexity (i.e. when late colonizers are established in high levels and proportions) may take months or even years to occur. The concept of exploiting our understanding of microbial succession in the subgingival habitat to improve therapies to treat and control periodontal diseases was suggested in 1998 in Socransky\u2019s benchmark study that described subgingival microbial complexes (337). The model built, based on data from the microbial analysis of 13,261 plaque samples, posited that colonization of the subgingival environment by orange\u2010complex species was required for the establishment of the so\u2010called red\u2010complex species. The authors suggested that this knowledge could be used in prevention strategies where orange\u2010complex species would be targeted, resulting in the inhibition of the more pathogenic species of the red complex. By examining the microbial shifts that take place after different periodontal treatments, it is apparent that the ecological changes which take place after therapy are, indeed, closely associated with the clinical outcome.",

Recent data from our department suggest that such changes can last for up to 2 years (119). We hypothesize that the ecosystem is altered directly by a reduction in pathogen numbers and indirectly by altering the status of the local host tissues. In particular, reduction in local inflammation would lead to lower levels of gingival crevicular fluid, diminishing a prominent source of nutrients for the growth of subgingival taxa (339, 360, 373). These alterations may lead to the additional slow, but continued, decline in a wide range of additional subgingival taxa. Furthermore, periodontal therapy results in a reduction of the deep periodontal pockets that foster colonization of red\u2010complex and orange\u2010complex species (337, 339). The treatment of periodontal diseases, for the most part, does not involve the reduction of a single bacterial species, but rather the alteration of an ecosystem to one in which pathogenic species remain below the threshold required for disease initiation or progression, while commensal species are favored (364). Changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota are accompanied by changes in the habitat, particularly in the adjacent host tissues. The alteration of the local environment, in turn, leads to an altered ecosystem and additional changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota with a reduction in the numbers of many other taxa. The new climax community approximates that typical of periodontal health. Thus, the effect of therapy is to \u2018set the clock back\u2019 for the development of the mature biofilm, requiring the subgingival microbiota to go through the time\u2010consuming changes necessary to trigger disease recurrence.",

The use of adjunct systemic metronidazole and amoxicillin might have an impact on the subgingival microbiota that goes beyond the red\u2010complex species, and the levels and proportions of orange\u2010complex species also seem to be affected (96, 232, 240, 321). As these species are required for establishment of the late colonizers, it seems that the use of this combination sets the clock further back. In this new scenario, the subgingival microbiota seems to require a longer period of time to recompose itself. It is also conceivable that a stronger antimicrobial effect might allow for a better and faster healing of the periodontal tissues, as suggested by the fewer residual pockets obtained following the use of this therapy (54, 125, 399), leading to a new environment that is less conducive for rebuilding the pathogenic subgingival biofilm.",

However, the use of molecular techniques to examine the microbiota of different body sites has raised awareness of the high degree of intraspecies genetic diversity, leading some microbiologists to question the very existence of bacterial species (101). It is apparent that bacteria are profoundly different from eukaryotes in how they exchange genetic material, clouding the concept of species (198). Furthermore, the identification of intraspecies genomic variation and data suggesting that genes encoding virulence factors are only found in a subset of strains has also raised questions regarding the relevance of species\u2010level identification (393). Therefore, one might ask whether the specific plaque hypothesis is still tenable if the concept of bacterial species is in question. Traditionally, bacterial species have been defined based on morphology, gram staining and a series of phenotypic characteristics determined after a battery of biochemical tests. Indeed, the phenotype of the bacterial strain remains, to this day, the primary criterion for species classification. However, with the introduction of the use of molecular techniques to assist in microbial taxonomy, including sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes, molecular approaches to distinct bacterial species have also been used. For instance, bacterial species have been defined as isolates sharing at least 70% homology after DNA\u2013DNA hybridization under standardized conditions. However, these methods have serious limitations and cannot be used to group similar strains into species; for instance, ribosomal RNA sequences are too conserved to resolve similar species (101). Valid estimates of molecular diversity can be obtained based on variability in sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA, but that estimate does not equate with species diversity (291). In recent years, 16S ribosomal RNA sequences have been favored for determining the closest relatives of an isolate, using phenotypic data to complement the characterization. In any event, if horizontal gene transfer (i.e. acquisition of genetic material from nonparental lineages) is as widespread as suggested in the literature, how can bacterial species maintain a set of core genes and traits in the face of such genomic fluidity (291)?",

Furthermore, horizontal gene transfer has been proposed as a mechanism that allows strains to obtain rapid access to genetic material carrying virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, impacting on the pathogenic potential of the recipient cells. How relevant in this context is, for instance, the study of P. gingivalis and its association with periodontal diseases? If the many virulence mechanisms that have been identified in this species can be freely shared among other species, how important is P. gingivalis to the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases? What would preclude any other bacterial species from acquiring these genes of virulence and becoming as pathogenic as P. gingivalis? We will explore this issue by first addressing the question of how freely genetic material can be shared through the microbiome of a given habitat. Studies that have examined the mechanisms which regulate horizontal gene transfer have indicated that the phylogeny of the cells involved in the transfer play an important role. For instance, the incorporation into the genome of genetic material acquired from close relatives is favored because these genes have greater compatibility with the molecular machinery required for their processing (331). The spatial distribution of bacterial cells within the biofilm might also regulate horizontal gene transfer by restricting dispersal. Others posit that ecology, rather than geography or phylogeny, is more important in regulating horizontal gene transfer (331). Irrespective of the nature of the forces that regulate horizontal gene transfer, mechanisms appear to exist through which phenotypic and genotypic similarity are maintained at higher levels among a large group of strains than would be expected at random (198). Periodic selection has been suggested as a mechanism to \u2018control\u2019 genetic diversification, maintaining genotypic cohesion among bacterial strains (22). According to this concept, a beneficial mutation would allow selection of the strains that acquired this trait, eliminating genetic variability from the population. In essence, natural selection would help to control the accumulation of neutral diversity that does not confer any additional benefit to the bacterial strains (i.e. with no direct effect on fitness). Ecotypes or ecospecies are an extension of this concept and refer to the selection of gene pools that confer fitness to certain strains to adapt to specific environmental conditions (57).",

Once the DNA has been transferred to the recipient cell, restriction endonucleases will cleave almost all incoming DNA, while exonucleases will degrade the double\u2010stranded DNA ends of the resulting fragments. These processes not only reduce the size of the incoming DNA, but frequently prevent the DNA fragment from integrating into the recipient chromosome. Alternatively, the incoming DNA fragment can be integrated into the chromosome through homologous recombination, replacing the corresponding resident allele. However, in order for homologous recombination to occur, a certain level of homology in nucleotide sequence between incoming and resident DNA is required. Once incorporated, the maintenance of the newly acquired genes is dependent on the mechanisms of natural selection for advantageous genes, as described above (198).",

This low frequency of detection of the new gene will favor its rapid loss from the population, even if it confers a beneficial function (198). Despite these mechanisms, horizontal gene transfer occurs between bacterial species; however, lateral gene transfers involving phylogenetically distant bacteria are infrequent in comparison with the rate of DNA recombination within species. Certain species of bacteria can differentiate into a state of competence for DNA transformation, in which cells acquire single\u2010stranded DNA through a DNA\u2010uptake complex that is specifically localized at a single cell pole (175). In fact, a recent study demonstrated that natural competence mechanisms are present in multiple strains of P. gingivalis (370). In summary, although horizontal gene transfer might result in common exchanges of DNA material within the microbiome of a given habitat, the incorporation of this genetic material into the genome of recipient cells is a much rarer event. In spite of these barriers to gene recombination, mutations will accumulate and eventually genetic isolation will result in the generation of a new species; however, gene divergence is a rather slow process and it occurs over tens of millions of years (57).",

The ratio of shared (core)/unique (auxiliary) portions of the genome varied greatly among different species. The core genome hypothesis reconciles the existence of dynamic genomes conferred by horizontal gene transfer with the existence of clusters of isolates that exhibit similar phenotypic traits, used by microbiologists over decades to group then into \u2018bacterial species\u2019.

The phenotypic traits of those organisms became the focus of the scientific community and their virulence mechanisms began to be characterized (114, 215). The infectious nature of the disease led to an interest in determining the epidemiology of periodontal pathogens, including their acquisition, intra\u2010oral distribution and route of transmission (113, 280, 408). Such information would provide a better understanding of the role of bacteria in the initiation and progression of periodontal diseases. Thus, during the 1990s a number of studies used restriction endonuclease analysis (113, 218), restriction fragment length polymorphism (216), multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (217) and arbitrarily primed PCR (239) to measure the relatedness of bacterial strains isolated from different individuals. Both related (such as spouses and siblings, as well as parents and offspring) and unrelated individuals were studied in the search for clonal variability of certain bacterial species (239, 280, 372, 377, 408). In most studies, the focus was the clonal variability of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, but other relevant periodontal taxa, such as E. corrodens, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and F. nucleatum, were also investigated (50, 86, 233).

Very different genetic and enzymatic patterns were observed among the isolates analyzed and no predominant dominant clone was observed across samples from unrelated individuals. Instead, rather unique individual patterns were identified (11, 218, 239, 265). In addition, it was observed that the same clonal types were often found in closely related individuals, such as parents and offspring, siblings and spouses, suggesting horizontal and vertical transmission (280, 372, 377, 380). It was shown that typically only one or two clones would colonize any given individual (11, 20, 219). Even though the source of the clonal types and transmission could be determined with those studies, the relevance of the differences across strains remains to be elucidated. The observation that the detection of P. gingivalis was not a determinant for the occurrence of periodontitis suggested that the genetic and/or phenotypic differences observed across the isolates could perhaps explain why some P. gingivalis carriers would develop periodontitis and others would not. Most of the studies that associated clonal variability with disease status have suggested that individual clones or genetic types may express different phenotypic characteristics. The hypothesis was that clusters of clones/strains would express specific phenotypic characteristics which would confer virulence (113).",

Most studies have failed to demonstrate a relationship between specific clusters of clones of P. gingivalis and the periodontal status of the host (217, 239). In addition, there is evidence that similar clonal types are observed in periodontal health and disease (356). It is possible that this discrepancy is a result of the use of different methodological approaches and varying sample sizes. Because of the observed heterogeneity in strains and lack of a predominant clonal type associated with disease, it has been proposed that all clonal types of P. gingivalis would be equally effective in colonizing the human host and that they share a common virulence potential (11). This argument led some authors to suggest that P. gingivalis is a commensal organism that can become an opportunistic pathogen (217, 239). However, the lack of distinct pathogenic clones within bacterial species does not define commensalism (20). In light of its widely demonstrated virulence properties and disease association, it appears unlikely that P. gingivalis is a commensal species (162, 194, 195, 396).",

P. gingivalis has minor and major fimbriae, which have been classified into six types (251). In clinical studies, the fimA II and fimA IV genes were associated with severe periodontitis, and strains having these genes demonstrated greater adhesive and invasive capabilities (92, 186, 371).

Techniques that utilize sequencing have become increasingly accessible and allow the molecular typing of unrelated isolates by characterizing genetic variations in the chromosomal DNA of bacterial species. Therefore, they are more precise and reproducible than are pattern\u2010based or \u2018fingerprinting\u2019 technologies, which simply determine distinct patterns of enzyme or DNA fragments. Molecular typing techniques, such as multilocus sequence typing, have been employed recently to study the population structure and genetic variability of P. gingivalis. Multilocus sequence typing is a nucleotide sequence\u2010based approach for the genetic characterization of bacterial isolates, based on the genetic variations found in a predetermined group of genes, typically five to eight housekeeping genes, such as pepO, recA, dnaK, nah and pga (177). Using multilocus sequence typing, Enersen et al. (93) showed that patients with periodontitis could harbor up to four clonal types of P. gingivalis and that patients with refractory periodontitis could be colonized by up to eight clonal types. This is a clear departure from the previous findings of one to two clones per patient (219). In addition, only closely related clones were observed in the same pocket, suggesting that DNA recombination may have occurred at that site. Thus, while there is considerable heterogeneity among P. gingivalis isolates, intra\u2010individual heterogeneity is low. Such genetic plasticity seems to be indicative of efficient mechanisms to adapt to a multitude of habitats and shifts in the environment, ensuring the survival of a portion of the population. However, the question of whether different groups of clones, and different sets of phenotypic traits expressed by them, could be linked to periodontal disease initiation and progression remained unanswered. Because P. gingivalis colonization starts early in life (64, 270), and disease manifestation tends to occur decades later (8), it could be argued that a change into more pathogenic clonal types could lead to the development of periodontal diseases over time. This hypothesis could explain the events of disease initiation and its bursts of activity, as previously noted. In that context, the next logical question would be whether clonal stability exists in P. gingivalis colonization over time, or if new (and more pathogenic) clones would arise and coincide with the onset of periodontitis.",

Using amplified fragment length polymorphism, the authors examined the clonal types of P. gingivalis in a population (including families) with untreated periodontitis over an 8\u2010year period. The authors observed considerable volatility in the acquisition and the loss of P. gingivalis genotypes. Even though P. gingivalis was detected in 105 individuals in 1994 and in 103 subjects in 2002, only 66 (46%) of those subjects were positive for P. gingivalis in both examinations. However, the percentage of individuals presenting with one, two or three genotypes (about 70%, 20% and 5%, respectively) remained stable over time. Forty\u2010six (69.7%) participants had at least one identical genotype in the second examination. The findings from a later study using multilocus sequence typing (374) indicated that the clonal stability of P. gingivalis is a robust event, in that even in the presence of periodontal treatment, consisting of scaling and root planing in combination with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin and metronidazole), the clonal types observed post\u2010therapy were the same ones detected before intervention. These results suggest at least four possibilities: (i) the incomplete eradication of P. gingivalis by treatment allowed cells to remain in the periodontal pocket and in neighboring tissues, and these cells recolonized the site after treatment; (ii) the same strain could be re\u2010acquired by familial transmission; (iii) positive selection of clones better fit to sustain the mechanical and antimicrobial challenges imposed by periodontal treatment; and (iv) combinations of all three mechanisms or any combination of two such mechanisms. Unfortunately, in the study by Winkelhoff et al. (384), the association between the stably colonizing clones and disease progression was not examined. In addition, the relationship between the presence of the post\u2010therapy isolates found by Valenza et al. (374) and the response to periodontal treatment was also not tested.

This is supported by the evidence that unrelated hosts harbor different clonal types and that closely related hosts (such as siblings, parents and spouses) appear to share similar clones (384). It is also supported by the findings from Enersen et al. (92), who demonstrated that only closely related clonal types were observed in individual pockets (one to eight clones per pocket). In general, the variation within a site was limited to two genes, pepO and recA, which are involved in DNA transformation, replication, recombination and repair, suggesting DNA recombination at the periodontal site. Despite advances in understanding the population structure and colonization dynamics of P. gingivalis, the relevance of the genetic differences observed across strains remains to be determined. Most of the interest in the genetic characterization of pathogens resides in their virulence mechanisms so that better diagnosis and treatments can be devised. Thus, from a therapeutic standpoint, the presence of similar virulence mechanisms in all strains of a species seems advantageous. The description of a core set of genes present in a species is a first and crucial step in that direction.

The authors argued that the genes which are not present in the core may be determinants of the differences in virulence found between the strains. These results should be seen as a first step, as the size of the core genome is a function of the number of strains analyzed (i.e. the greater the number of strains, the smaller the core is expected to be because of the increase in genetic variability).

There were also concerns that they would not detect all strains of a given species and that they would have a low sensitivity in terms of the numbers of cells that they detected. Those critiques were addressed in detail in a publication in which the status of the checkerboard technique was evaluated after 10 years of routine use in clinical studies and the analysis of tens of thousands of biofilm samples (339). The authors searched for cross\u2010reactions by hybridizing probes for the 40 typical species analyzed using checkerboard with targets from 80 bacterial species. Probes for certain species, such as T. forsythia, showed virtually no measurable cross\u2010reactions to any of the test taxa. The probe for F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii exhibited weak cross\u2010reactions with F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum and F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, as well as a weak cross\u2010reaction with C. rectus. The probe for S. intermedius exhibited virtually no cross\u2010reactions except for the expected reactions with the two other members of the \u2018streptococcus milleri group\u2019\u2013Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus. The authors also demonstrated that the cross\u2010reactions observed could be eliminated with the use of subtraction hybridization and PCR probes, as well as with competitive hybridization, if one was particularly interested in those species.",

Still, the culture studies that provided the basis for the selection of the checkerboard probe panel might have been unable to detect those difficult\u2010to\u2010culture species and most certainly did not detect unculturable ones. It was known that many organisms, recognized by their appearance in plaque samples viewed by light or electron microscopy, were not being cultured (340). In fact, additional unculturable species might not even be distinctive under the microscope, making it virtually impossible to estimate the extent of the unculturable segment of the microbiota and whether it harbors pathogenic species. The discrepancy between microscopic and plate counts had been known for many years in oral microbiology (242, 333), as well as in environmental microbiology (286), and the phenomenon was later described as the \u2018great plate count anomaly\u2019 (343).",

Although this number has been disputed in the field of environmental microbiology (80), it seems that environmental microbiologists face a much greater challenge than do oral microbiologists. It is a testimony to the quality of the work of the pioneers in periodontal microbiology that over 50% of morphotypes present in plaque samples can be grown in the laboratory. This figure has often been preceded in several texts by the word \u2018only\u2019. We have a more optimistic view and see the 50% of culturable species as a perfect example of a \u2018glass half\u2010full\u2019, particularly considering the numbers suggested by Amman and co\u2010workers for other types of samples. Owing to the continuous efforts of a small number of dedicated scientists to culture difficult\u2010to\u2010grow oral bacterial species (83, 387, 388, 390), this estimated percentage of yet\u2010uncultured species has been recently reduced to 35% (75). In fact, Griffen et al. (124) recently used pyrosequencing to compare subgingival biofilm samples from periodontally healthy patients with those from periodontitis patients and reported that although sequences from uncultured taxa were more abundant in samples from diseased sites, overall, 81% of the sequences identified were mapped to cultured species.",

Rather, the amplification of conserved areas of a ubiquitous bacterial gene (the 16S ribosomal RNA gene) by a highly sensitive method (PCR) (122) would allow the identification of all microbial taxa present in a given sample. Ultimately, there was an expectation that new species would be identified in the uncultured segment and that these would be associated with periodontal health and disease and would bring much\u2010needed answers to many of the questions on the microbiology of periodontal diseases. A few groups began using cloning and sequencing to explore the microbial diversity in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis (184, 303), but the first comprehensive description of the subgingival microbiota based on this approach was delineated by Paster et al. (276). The authors analyzed subgingival plaque samples from 31 individuals, including periodontally healthy subjects as well as patients with chronic and refractory periodontitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and HIV\u2010associated periodontitis. The authors estimated that 500 taxa could colonize the oral cavity and found that 347 species/phylotypes could be found in the subgingival environment. Of those, 215 were novel phylotypes (i.e. uncultured or culturable but unnamed taxa) and 140 were detected only once.

The inclusion of samples from different diseased entities might have clouded differences between periodontal health and disease. For instance, in the study of Paster et al. (276), samples from a rather heterogeneous group of disease entities were included and it is likely that each of those conditions present distinct microbiotas. Owing to the low throughput afforded by the technique, relatively small numbers of patients and samples from each subject were included (189, 190, 276). This can be a problem because considerable variability has been observed in the composition of host\u2010associated microbiotas (65, 274), including subgingival biofilms (158). Furthermore, typically 168 sites are clinically monitored in periodontal studies (28 teeth \u00d7 six sites per tooth); therefore, four subgingival samples represent <3% of all sites being monitored. In addition, when few samples are collected from the same individual, the larger one(s) tend to be over\u2010represented; this is particularly critical when samples are pooled (335). A lesson learned by Socransky during his early days as a microbiologist and passed on to his many students was \u2018thou shalt not pool\u2019, in reference to the many problems that arrive from attempting to interpret data obtained from pooled plaque samples. It is noteworthy that close\u2010ended approaches using real time\u2010PCR have been able to routinely detect classical periodontal pathogens, even when few samples were collected or pooled (41, 55), suggesting that other procedures associated with cloning and sequencing could be the source of the infrequent detection of periodontal pathogens.",

One of the possible reasons for these findings was the assumption that the use of universal primers would amplify DNA from all bacterial species present in a sample with the same efficiency; this was later proven not to be the case. Hutter et al. (159) employed two sets of universal primers and reported that they could observe P. gingivalis in 12 of the 26 periodontitis patients examined. This was achieved even though only one sample was collected from each patient and many fewer clones per patient were sequenced (22 compared with 50 to 100 routinely analyzed). Later, de Lillo et al. (72) demonstrated that \u2018universal\u2019 PCR primers can introduce bias into analysis of the species composition of clone libraries because of mismatches between the sequence of the primer and the sequence of the target organism. Since then, the use of different sets of universal primers has been proposed, as well as the use of enrichment primers for specific phyla, such as spirochetes (75, 159, 276).",

Collectively, it was demonstrated that several aspects of the PCR amplification of multitemplate samples, including template concentration, number of amplification cycles, annealing temperature and chimera formation, could alter the microbial profiles of the sample under study. Furthermore, the nature of the cell wall of the species present in the sample will affect cell lysis and DNA\u2010extraction protocols, and genomes with a higher guanine+cytosine content appear to be less successfully amplified (13, 78, 281, 392). In the case of cloning studies, the number of clones analyzed might also influence the resulting microbial diversity and profiles. In addition, the use of an aliquot of the DNA extracted from samples might introduce other types of bias analogous to those introduced by the dispersion and dilution necessary for culture studies (340) and this aliquot might not fully represent the whole sample (49). The importance of validation studies testing different sources of bias at different stages of sample processing, such as collection (358) and amplification (89, 357), cannot be emphasized strongly enough. Furthermore, the effects of primer selection (72, 187) and of the levels and types of taxa should also be assessed using mock communities of known species (78, 157, 361). A recent paper published by Diaz et al. (78) elegantly illustrates the relevance of validation studies. The authors examined the limitations associated with high\u2010throughput sequencing or next\u2010generation sequencing and the intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. Next\u2010generation sequencing is an open\u2010ended, culture\u2010independent approach that has replaced cloning and sequencing in the study of complex ecosystems and was only recently introduced for the study of the oral microbiota (172, 410). The analysis of mock communities composed of seven oral bacterial species showed primer and DNA\u2010isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity. The data from the clinical and mock samples allowed the authors to devise an experimental and analytical framework that should facilitate the design and interpretation of future high\u2010throughput sequencing studies (78). The long list of biases given above should not discourage the reader from considering the findings obtained on the composition of the periodontal microbiota using open\u2010ended molecular techniques. Instead, it should be a reminder that all techniques have limitations; it is up to the scientist to identify them, to acknowledge them, to attempt to overcome them and, most importantly, to interpret carefully the results generated from using them. This is particularly important when using new techniques or exploring new environments.",

The first study to investigate the oral microbiota via next\u2010generation sequencing estimated that 19,000 phylotypes may be present in the human oral microbiota (172), a major increase from the earlier estimates of 700 taxa (278). Meanwhile, as the technology became more routinely used, a number of potential sources of bias were identified. For instance, Kunin et al. (192) showed that the use of low\u2010stringency filters for sequencing reads can overestimate diversity and lead to inflated numbers of taxa in a given environment. In addition, Wu et al. (400) demonstrated that the PCR conditions, such as the choice of polymerase, dilution of the template and the number of PCR cycles used, can have significant effects on the analysis of microbial diversity and community structure. Because these technologies provide tremendous coverage depth, it is important to determine the extent of the biases introduced on the profile of any given community.

It involves the use of digoxigenin\u2010labeled oligonucleotide sequences targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA gene that are hybridized with the total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) extracted from biofilm samples. The probe sequences employed in the RNA\u2010oligonucleotide quantification technique are the same sequences used in the human oral microbial identification microarray, which facilitates the comparison of results. In order to permit quantification, sequences complementary to the probes are used as standards and are added to the membranes, typically at 0.004 and 0.04 pM. Chemiluminescent signals are then visualized using a charge\u2010coupled device camera (Fig. 13). Besides its high throughput and being quantitative, another advantage of the RNA\u2010oligonucleotide quantification technique is that it targets primarily the ribosomal RNA molecule, which is far more abundant than the ribosomal RNA gene. The first benefit of this approach is that an abundant target molecule obviates the need for the PCR\u2010amplification step. Oligonucleotide probes are known to be relatively specific but to lack sensitivity; therefore, an amplification step is often required if the target is the ribosomal RNA gene. The second benefit is that, because of the use of ribosomal RNA as a target molecule, the metabolic activity of the target taxa can be inferred, as an actively growing cell has 103\u2013104 ribosomal RNA molecules (316) and ribosomal RNA is more associated with cell viability than is DNA (238). Hence, targeting ribosomal RNA can provide insights on the relevance of the test species in the ecosystem of interest and avoid bias in the results caused by the presence of dead cells (255).",

In addition, the estimated prevalence of each HOT in the oral cavity is also available, as determined by a comprehensive cloning and sequencing initiative (75). In this study, more than 35,000 clones of clinical samples from different oral conditions, as well as 1,000 clinical oral isolates from culture collections (75), were examined and sequenced. In its current format, the human oral microbiome database contains 645 taxa: about 50% are named species, about 16% are unnamed cultured taxa and about 34% represent uncultured phylotypes. Once a taxonomic anchor (a HOT number) is given to a taxon, it remains unchanged. This is a major advantage for the establishment of a foundation of the oral microbiome, particularly because of ongoing efforts to characterize oral isolates from culture collections (75, 81, 82, 83), as well as to culture uncultured taxa (85, 323, 387). The success of those efforts, and the value of the human oral microbiome database, are highlighted by the increase in the percentage of named species and the decrease in the percentage of unnamed cultured taxa since 2010 (51).

It is probable that at least two techniques combined will be necessary (e.g. culture and molecular methods). This approach has been proposed and tested by Vianna et al. (391) and Donachie et al. (80). Donachie et al. (80) challenged the dogma perpetuated by the \u2018great plate count anomaly\u2019 that culture approaches detected only a fraction of the total number of bacteria in a sample and were limited in scope. They also criticized the exclusive reliance on RNA sequencing for environmental studies of microbial diversity. According to the authors: \u2018overlooking a century of cultivation history and encouraging the use of only ribosomal approaches leads to significant gaps in microbial diversity data\u2019. They reasoned that culture methods are critical in microbial diversity studies as these methods identified organisms that were undetected using molecular techniques. To test their hypothesis they examined to what extent the data sets of culture\u2010dependent and culture\u2010independent approaches overlapped. They posited that if open\u2010ended 16S ribosomal RNA\u2010based approaches represented better the \u2018true\u2019 diversity present in a microbial sample, culture libraries should not detect taxa absent from data sets recovered using the molecular approach. Data from seven studies were compared in which culture and open\u2010ended molecular techniques were used on the same samples. Samples had been collected from a wide range of ecosystems, including root canals, caries lesions, lakes and oceans. It was observed that the largest overlap between the two approaches was 30% in caries samples and 20% in endodontic samples, which means that each approach was covering a different segment of the microbiota. In addition, in two of the ecosystems under study, there was no overlap between the two approaches. Therefore, the study could not demonstrate that molecular approaches captured a wider spectrum of microbial diversity. In addition, when analyzing microscopic and plate counts, one can see at least part of what is not being detected in culture because the morphotypes initially observed are not recovered from agar plates. On the other hand, in molecular techniques, one does not have the opportunity to \u2018see\u2019 what has not been amplified, unless mock communities are used.",

We anticipate that this selection will result in a panel of 40 probes, which will be used to guide the isolation, in pure culture, of culturable, but yet unnamed, taxa. The rationale for this phase of the study is that many of the uncultured/unnamed cultured taxa may be cultured using standard culture techniques, leaving a smaller set as truly uncultured species. We will use the oligonucleotide probes to the selected 40 prominent unculturable/unnamed taxa to screen isolates obtained from subgingival biofilm samples from periodontally healthy and diseased subjects. Samples will be dispersed, serially diluted, plated on five isolation media and grown in three different atmospheres: anaerobic, microaerophilic and capnophilic. After incubation, isolates will be colony lifted and hybridized with the preselected 40 probes. Colonies that give positive signals on each medium/atmosphere combination will be counted and the data used to select the three best media/atmosphere combinations that provided the greatest recovery of unnamed taxa. In the final stage of the study, a second set of samples from periodontally healthy and diseased subjects with be grown using the three selected media/atmosphere combinations. After incubation, all isolates on primary isolation plates containing at least 50 colonies will be picked and spotted onto three plates of the same medium. After incubation, two such plates will be \u2018lifted\u2019 and hybridized with two sets of 20 probes, while the third will be kept as a source of test isolates. Colonies that give positive signals will be identified using the RNA\u2010oligonucleotide quantification technique, while the unnamed isolates will be phenotypically characterized and sequenced. We expect that the characterization of these species will be the first stage in delineating novel pathogens and will focus the search for the truly uncultured species by providing targeting probes. Distinguishing the culturable but unnamed taxa will provide isolates for taxonomy, virulence and antigenicity testing, and structural and physiological characterization.",

Unfortunately, most existing methods for biofilm sample collection disrupt the tridimensional structure of these polymicrobial structures. Even though microbial complexes have been determined by Socransky et al. (337), and corroborated by others over the years using different approaches (85, 178), the model was built based on the frequency of the simultaneous occurrence of a group of taxa, irrespective of their spatial distribution within the biofilm. During sample collection for checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization, the physical interaction and the spatial distribution of the species identified are disrupted and therefore they cannot be inferred using this technique. The elegant model proposed by Kolenbrander et al. (178), summarizing the interactions and localization of the taxa that colonize the subgingival environment, represents a compilation of findings from the authors and other researchers, deduced using reductionist in\u2010vitro and in\u2010vivo experiments. The physical interaction and biogeography of periodontal bacteria have been explored using immunohistochemistry (176, 256, 257, 258, 259) and fluorescence in\u2010situ hybridization (317, 411). These results indicated that, in subgingival plaque, red complex bacteria tend to be part of the epithelium\u2010associated biofilm, orange complex species are typically found in the \u2018loosely attached\u2019 biofilm and Actinomyces species, as well as species of the green and yellow complexes, tend to localize in the coronal portions of the biofilm, mostly in the tooth\u2010associated biofilm (336). Data from Zijnge et al. (411) suggested that species of Fusobacterium and Tannerella were present in the intermediate layer of subgingival biofilms; species associated with periodontitis (such as P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis and P. micra) were localized in the outer layer of the biofilm; and a fourth layer of unattached plaque, consisting mainly of Spirochetes, seemed to form on top of the outer layer of the subgingival biofilm. Noteworthy was the demonstration of the presence of species of Synergistetes in close proximity to host immune cells, indicating their potential role in host\u2013microbe interactions (411). Recently, Schillinger et al. (317) showed a tight clustering of F. nucleatum/F. periodonticum and T. forsythia in in\u2010vivo developed biofilms, as well as a random spatial distribution between P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in these in\u2010vivo samples.",

However, limitations in current technologies have prevented a comprehensive study of microbial community organization (375). In principle, fluorescence in\u2010situ hybridization probes could be designed with ribosomal RNA sequence specificity for nearly any microbial phylotype or taxon. The limitations of this approach reside in the use of the filters in fluorescence image acquisition and in the excitation crosstalk and emission bleed\u2010through of available organic fluorochromes (375). These technical constraints limit the number of fluorophores that can be differentiated simultaneously (375, 395). Valm et al. (375) overcame these limitations using a combinatorial labeling strategy coupled with spectral image acquisition and analysis, therefore greatly expanding the number of fluorescent signatures discernible in a single image. The technique, named combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging\u2013fluorescence in\u2010situ hybridization, uses genus\u2010 and family\u2010specific probes to simultaneously visualize and differentiate 15 different phylotypes. Figure 18 presents combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging\u2013fluorescence in\u2010situ hybridization images of semidispersed human dental plaque. The figure shows that the plaque was dominated by early colonizers, including species of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Actinomyces and Veillonella. Proximity analysis was used to determine the frequency of intertaxon and intrataxon cell\u2010to\u2010cell associations, which revealed statistically significant intertaxon pairings. Cells of the genera Prevotella and Actinomyces showed the most interspecies associations, suggesting a central role for these genera in establishing and maintaining biofilm complexity. Work is underway at The Forsyth Institute, in collaboration with Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratories (Woods Hole, MA, USA), to expand the probe panel used initially and explore the spatial organization of the oral microbiome to include biofilms associated with different oral surfaces for which the microbial profiles have been described (3, 225), as well as the subgingival biofilms associated with the different surfaces of the periodontal pockets.",

Among the many factors that define the so\u2010called \u2018host susceptibility\u2019, the immuno\u2010inflammatory response that accompanies the bacterial challenge is clearly part of the constellation of minimal causes that lead to periodontal tissue destruction. In other words, without inflammation, there is no periodontal disease initiation and progression. Evidence to support a role of inflammation in periodontal diseases comes from epidemiological studies; these studies have indicated that the presence of gingival inflammation over prolonged periods of time is associated with clinical attachment loss and tooth loss (313, 314).

These concepts have been the cornerstones of our understanding of periodontal diseases for decades and elegantly acknowledge the microbial challenge and the immuno\u2010inflammatory host response as key elements of periodontal disease etiology and pathogenesis. However, in recent years, this simple framework has been challenged once more by efforts to assign greater importance to the immuno\u2010inflammatory response compared with the microbiota in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

Conversely, the inflammatory infiltrate clearly results in a loss of collagen content and is adjacent to the bone\u2010resorbing activity. Although bacterial products, such as proteases and lipopolysaccharides, can cause direct tissue damage (282) and stimulate bone resorption (84), host\u2010derived molecules, such as matrix metalloproteinases and interleukin\u20101\u03b2, are more potent mediators of these catabolic processes (148, 342, 344, 345). Furthermore, it is likely that the levels of inflammatory mediators which lead to tissue destruction reach much higher concentrations within the periodontal lesions than do microbial products with similar functions. Hence, it is well accepted that most of the tissue destruction observed in periodontal diseases results from indirect damage mediated by the immuno\u2010inflammatory response. However, even if inflammation is the main mechanism of destruction of periodontal tissues, this does not imply that its direct control is the best strategy for the prevention and the treatment of periodontal diseases.

A series of animal studies in the 1980s demonstrated that nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs were capable of slowing the progression of periodontal diseases (154). Subsequent human clinical studies demonstrated similar results (398); however, the safety profile of these drugs did not allow for their prolonged continuous use.

For most bacteria, including pathogens, asymptomatic colonization and/or clearance without blatant disease are the most common results of an encounter with the host. As a result of genetic variability among different strains of the same bacterial species and individuals of the same host species, these interactions might be rather unique, with several possible outcomes, including: immediate clearance, colonization (with or without disease), long\u2010term asymptomatic carriage, invasion, direct damage (e.g. bacterial toxins) and immunopathology. Clearance might occur after other interactions, for instance, as a result of a disease process. In addition, a carrier state may evolve into overt disease. Therefore, disease onset seems to require a fairly specific set of interactions between host and bacterial factors. Even some of the most relevant human pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cause disease on relatively rare occasions, considering the level of exposure to these microorganisms (279). As alluded to earlier, much attention has been paid to the notion that periodontal tissue destruction results from indirect, rather than direct, tissue damage induced by bacteria. Immunopathology is a pathogenic mechanism common to many infections; however, the specific immuno\u2010inflammatory mechanisms involved in different infectious diseases are distinct.

Oral bacterial antigens from Bacteroides fragilis, S. mitis and P. acnes primed human dendritic cells to induce T\u2010helper 1 cell, T\u2010helper 2 cell and T\u2010regulatory cell differentiation, respectively (181). Lymphocytes stimulated with antigens from oral streptococci increased the expression of interleukin\u20104 (a T\u2010helper 2 cell cytokine), while stimulation with antigens from Bacteroides species resulted in increased expression of interferon\u2010\u03b3 (a T\u2010helper 1 cell cytokine) (155). Antigens of oral streptococci induced the differentiation of na\u00efve T\u2010cells into T\u2010helper 2 cells, while antigen preparations of anaerobic bacteria induced the differentiation of T\u2010helper 1 cells (386). P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide can also modulate T\u2010cell immunity by downregulating the expression of cytokines such as interferon\u2010\u03b3, interleukin\u201012 and interleukin\u20108 (296). Furthermore, A. actinomycetemcomitans is capable of modulating T\u2010cell responses through several mechanisms, including induction of T\u2010cell apoptosis (252), expression of superantigens (406) and preferential stimulation of T\u2010cells secreting interleukin\u20104 and interleukin\u201010 (407). Therefore, the expression of cytokines that modulate T\u2010cell immunity is influenced by the composition of subgingival biofilms. It is beyond the scope of this manuscript to review all host\u2013microbe interactions that have been reported in periodontal diseases. The lesson learned here is that in host\u2013microbe interactions during periodontal pathogenesis, neither player has a passive role.",

Molecules such as cytokines have been dichotomized as either \u2018protective\u2019 or \u2018destructive\u2019 or as either \u2018proinflammatory\u2019 or \u2018anti\u2010inflammatory\u2019. Although the data generated using these approaches have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the patterns of expression of these molecules in periodontal health and disease, it has become apparent that these approaches will no longer suffice for the study of complex host\u2013microbe interactions. The inadequacy of simple scenarios where proinflammatory cytokines should be inhibited, while anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines could be used as therapeutics, is illustrated by the realization that their functions might vary depending on the context in which they are studied. For instance, interleukin\u20106 is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been associated with periodontal tissue destruction and has been proposed as a biomarker of periodontal disease progression (111). However, there is evidence that interleukin\u20106 might act as a potent anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine. In a murine model of peri\u2010apical lesions, interleukin\u20106 knockout mice and the neutralization of interleukin\u20106 using antibodies resulted in significantly higher periapical bone resorption (29). Interfering with the cytokine network (or with any other class of inflammatory mediators for that matter), without taking into account the effects on the host\u2013microbe interactions, might have disastrous consequences.",

When anticytokine therapy was used in animal models of sepsis (e.g. anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha) not all animal models demonstrated enhanced survival, particularly when cytokines were blocked in live bacterial models compared with models using injection of purified endotoxins (endotoxemia). In fact, these studies demonstrated that an endogenous tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha response was essential for the formation of abscesses to isolate the infectious agent (79). This is particularly relevant when drugs that block tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune disease) are suggested by some as a potential treatment for periodontal diseases, which are infections (236). There is a growing body of evidence that blocking tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha might result in an increased risk for opportunistic infections, including mycobacterial diseases. Furthermore, absence of the interleukin\u20101 receptor can also result in decreased resistance to Listeria or to gram\u2010positive bacteria (79). In his elegant review of the role of cytokines in periodontal disease pathogenesis, Garlet (107) stressed the fallacy of examining the functions of cytokines solely under the \u2018protective vs. destructive archetype\u2019 and emphasized the need to take into account their role in the \u2018control of infection viewpoint\u2019. In fact, his research team had previously reported a role for tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha and interferon\u2010\u03b3 in controlling the microbial challenge in periodontal diseases. Using knockout mice and A. actinomycetemcomitans infection to induce periodontal disease, they demonstrated that both cytokines were essential for the control of the experimental infection, as evidenced by an increased bacterial load and elevated acute\u2010phase response compared with wild\u2010type controls (108, 109). Here we have another example of how the focus solely on the host response might be counterproductive.",

It is also recognized that subgingival biofilms present great variability in their microbial composition (124, 158), and neighboring sites on different teeth may differ considerably in their levels and proportions of colonizing bacterial species (336). Far less appreciated has been the effect of this microbial diversity on the cytokine milieu released by the adjacent periodontal tissues. Teles et al. (363) examined, in periodontally healthy subjects and in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, in\u2010vivo associations among the composition of subgingival biofilms (determined using checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization) and the levels of eight cytokines in the gingival crevicular fluid [measured using a multiplexed bead immunoassay (Luminex)]. The microbiotas associated with periodontal health and generalized aggressive periodontitis were characterized using hierarchical cluster analysis of the site\u2010specific levels of 40 subgingival species. The results demonstrated that the cytokine profiles associated with the clusters in the periodontally healthy subjects were more homogeneous and presented a similar pattern, with interleukin\u201010 comprising over 50% of the total gingival crevicular fluid cytokines. In contrast, the group of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis presented a more diverse pattern of cytokine expression among the microbial clusters (Fig. 19). The authors concluded that different subgingival biofilm profiles are associated with distinct patterns of expression of gingival crevicular fluid cytokines.",

This simple statement implies that in order to understand fully the mechanisms that lead to periodontal diseases, scientists in the field will have to use alternative approaches to the ones employed so far. This is not necessarily a new lesson; in a comment about the difficulties in identifying the etiological agents of periodontal infections, Socransky wrote: \u2018Unfortunately, at this time it is difficult to even suggest methods to assess the significance of bacterial agents or metabolites in \u201cnatural\u201d periodontal diseases\u2019 (332). It is not difficult to imagine that the same statement would apply to the study of the immuno\u2010inflammatory response in periodontal diseases. Traditionally, science has taken a reductionist approach, dissecting biological systems into their building blocks and studying them separately. Because individual parts of biological systems (e.g. single genes or proteins) never work in isolation, but rather in integrated networks, reductionist methodologies will never give us a complete picture of how those complex systems work. Because health and disease are the result of the dynamic changes in these integrated networks, a more holistic \u2018systems biology\u2019 approach will be required to understand them fully (105). There is no consensus regarding the definition of systems biology, but it can be described as methods aimed at integrating quantitative data from different outputs with the objective to describe and predict the function of biological systems. The predictive models derived from such methodology should greatly enhance our ability to understand health and disease; they should not only allow for a better description of biological systems, but should also help in the study of those systems. In other words, these models should help us to discover new properties of the biological systems they attempt to characterize. In the past decade the systems\u2010biology paradigm has been favored by many scientists trying to understand the incredible complexity of biological systems and apply this knowledge to clinical practice.",

For instance, human studies have been conducted on the transcriptome of gingival tissues in health and disease, and at different stages during experimental gingivitis (262, 272). Papapanou et al. (272) demonstrated that colonization by T. forsythia and P. gingvalis was associated with the differential expression of thousands of genes in the adjacent gingival tissue, while the host\u2010compatible species A. naeslundii was merely associated with eight probe sets. The transcriptome of gingival tissues during experimental gingivitis has also been recently characterized (262). The data demonstrated that 131 immune response\u2010related genes were significantly up\u2010regulated or down\u2010regulated during the induction and/or resolution of gingivitis. These genes corresponded to a relatively small subset (11.9%) of immune\u2010response genes present in the gene array, suggesting specificity in the gingival transcriptomic response to plaque accumulation. In addition, new candidate genes and pathways were identified as being altered during experimental gingivitis, including neural processes, epithelial defenses, angiogenesis and wound healing. Unbiased metabolomic profiling of gingival crevicular fluid samples from healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites demonstrated that the metabolic composition of gingival crevicular fluid was the result of host and bacterial interactions and accurately reflected the disease status of the site (31). The results suggested up\u2010regulation of the inflammatory pathway of purine degradation, depletion of antioxidants, the degradation of host cellular components, the accumulation of bacterial products and the leakage of host circulation components into disease sites (Fig. 20) (31).",

Periodontal disease initiation and progression might not only be associated with shifts in biofilm composition but also result from changes in the biofilm metabolism and the synthesis of virulence factors. Hence, there was a need to develop new tools to study the physiology of these microorganisms in their environment. Newly developed metatranscriptomic approaches have been engineered for characterizing the gene expression of entire microbial communities (103); studies using this approach, combined with metagenomics, were recently initiated at The Forsyth Institute (102). Metagenomic and gene\u2010expression analysis of entire complex bacterial communities in situ provide the information required to understand the activity and relative importance of the constituents of the pathogenic biofilm during periodontal infections, including unculturable microorganisms. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics treat the microbial community and its constituent genes as a whole. In metagenomic analysis, DNA is extracted from the entire community and large\u2010scale sequencing is conducted on the community\u2019s genomic material. This approach overcomes bias and other problems associated with PCR amplification (77) and it is not limited to analysis of a predetermined number of bacteria, or to a specific gene such as 16S ribosomal RNA (100).",

The key to assess expression analysis in whole microbial communities is the linear amplification of small quantities of RNA extracted from the bacterial assemblages. The final amplified RNA is a direct representation of the relative abundance of mRNA in the original sample. Linear RNA amplification methods have been previously used to study gene expression in eukaryotic tissues but are not generally applicable to microbial mRNA because of the requirement for a poly(A) tail. Wendisch et al. (397) developed a method for the polyadenylation of bacterial mRNA, which facilitates the preferential isolation of bacterial mRNA from ribosomal RNA in crude extracts. The second aspect that facilitates metatranscriptomic analysis of whole bacterial communities is that pyrosequencing techniques now allow for the sequencing of large amounts of DNA, avoiding cloning biases associated with classical techniques. Taking advantage of this new technology, Frias\u2010Lopez et al. (103) developed a method to study expression profiles of whole microbial communities in situ, opening the possibility of studying the physiology of microbes in their environment. This method allows the identification of species present in a complex microbial community, in addition to determining their metabolic activity. We anticipate that this approach will lead to the in\u2010situ identification of virulence factors in oral biofilms that result in disease progression in periodontitis. The ability to characterize gene expression and gene interactions among entire bacterial communities in situ during different stages of periodontal disease progression has the potential to revolutionize the study of these infections.",

The counts of 40 subgingival species were measured at each of up to 14 sites in each subject and were employed in a cluster analysis using the chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. Five clusters (CL1\u2013CL5) were formed at >33% similarity. Four subjects presented at least one site with a microbial profile that did not fit any cluster (NIC). The numbers above each panel represent the number of subjects with at least one site with the microbial profile that defined that cluster.
