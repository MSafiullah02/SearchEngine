The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive rent in this cloth as hospitals experience a surge of patients: CT PE is often delayed or not performed due to co-morbid renal failure precluding the use of intravenous contrast and cardiopulmonary instability leading to an unacceptable risk for transfer. Similarly, duplex ultrasonography (DUS) for the diagnosis of DVT is difficult to perform due to large number of patients, many of whom will be housed in field hospitals without diagnostic vascular unit labs (DVUs), a contracted registered vascular technician workforce, and length of time associated with and difficulty in completely disinfecting the machines in between patients.",

It is arguably both within the realm of physician capability and obligation to minimize exposure to RVTs in our DVUs, while minimizing harm to patients. Furthermore, with a dedicated skill set requiring the use of expensive equipment, RVTs represent a scare resource during a pandemic, that if depleted, would inhibit our ability to detect other life and limb threatening conditions that require urgent/emergent treatment such as acute limb ischemia, pseudoaneurysms and carotid disease leading to stroke.",

There is a paucity of data on VTE in COVID-19, however one study found a mortality benefit to thromboprophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin amongst COVID-19 positive patients with highly elevated (>3x upper limit of normal) D-dimer and sepsis induced coagulopathy score.3 The true incidence of VTE is unknown, and likely variable across different patient populations, with the highest case reports of pulmonary embolism (PE) in up to 40% of patients with elevated D dimer undergoing CT PE.4, 5, 6 These data suggest VTE or primary pulmonary thrombi may be an underlying etiology responsible for mortality in severe COVID-19 infections. In patients who initially present with less severe disease, the risk from failure to reassess and provide timely thromboprophylaxis in an over-capacity healthcare system is much more likely to outweigh the risk of major bleeding from appropriately dosed thromboprophylaxis (\u223c1%).1 Further, while some may choose to use larger doses of thromboprophylaxis, there is no clear evidence basis for this, and we defer to the front line practicioner.7 The committee therefore recommends routine thromboprophylaxis of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 regardless of risk score (Table II\n).",

The intubated, critically ill patient who is low risk by the Wells\u2019 score may qualify for empiric lower dose anticoagulation if their bleeding risk is low. Higher consideration should be given to empiric low dose anticoagulation if the Partial pressure of arterial oxygen/Fractional inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio is less than 200. We do not recommend that duplex ultrasonography be performed in patients to exclude the diagnosis of PE. The rationale for this is that the use of DVT imaging in the setting of suspected PE has a low accuracy, a sensitivity of 44%, a specificity of 86%, a positive predictive value 58% and a negative predictive value of 77%.9 This data has been substantiated in other studies with reported sensitivities of 25-38% for the diagnosis of thrombosis when being used as a surrogate for PE. Thus, duplex imaging has significant limitations in the diagnosis of PE or in situ pulmonary thrombosis and is not a direct test for PE.",

Patients meeting the following criteria during this time were treated with an empiric low dose anticoagulation protocol: P/F ratio < 200; viral pneumonia suspected or confirmed; no absolute contraindications to anticoagulation. In patients meeting these criteria, the following protocol reduced the risk of VTE and primary pulmonary thrombi without increasing bleeding complications: initiation of non-nomogram heparin infusion with a goal Xa between 0.2-0.3; no bolus dose administered. The lower Xa is necessary given the risk of bleeding with hemorrhagic pneumonitis. Of note, this goal Xa does not match with an existing heparin nomogram at our institution, and requires manual titration by the inpatient team.11 It therefore may be a reasonable, although untested, strategy to utilize the ACS nomogram with lower Xa ranges (0.2-0.5) to reduce clinician workload if bleeding risk is acceptable (Table II). In intubated patients without ARDS, there is a paucity of data regarding risk-benefit ratio of empiric anticoagulation strategies.

In the low bleeding risk patient (VTE-BLEED score <2), we suggest empiric full dose therapeutic anticoagulation for the non-intubated admitted patient. In the intubated critically ill patient, we recommend empiric lower dose anticoagulation, due to the expected elevated bleeding risk with common comorbid conditions such as renal failure, DIC and hemorrhagic pneumonitis (Figures 3 and 4). In the high bleeding risk patient (VTE-BLEED score >2), a lower extremity DVT scan may be indicated if the patients meets criteria (Table V). We note that the VTE-BLEED score (Table IV) is validated in the outpatient population, and that no similar score exists for use in the acutely hospitalized nor critically ill population. This specific patient cohort may have additional risk factors that increase bleeding risk such as thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis and other anti-thrombotic use that should be taken into consideration by the clinician at the bedside. Furthermore, the VTE-BLEED scan is validated for bleeding risk over a longer time period than expected in most patients treated with this algorithm, therefore physicians may be comfortable with full dose anticoagulation if a patient has multiple risk factors, recognizing the less absolute number of days subjected to risk. If the DVT scan is negative, then thromboprophylaxis is recommended. If the study is positive, consideration should be given to full dose anticoagulation, or an IVC filter. For patients treated with lower dose empiric anticoagulation in the ICU setting, standard full dose anticoagulation should be initiated once they become floor status.",

This is the current status as only a small aliquot of hours stand between us and the overwhelming tide of patients throughout the nation and in many parts of the world. Proactive use of an algorithmic approach to care in this setting has the following advantages: (1) decreases variability in care across the healthcare system; (2) relieves stress on the individual provider on determining optimal treatment without appropriate and usual diagnostic tests; (3) harnesses existing healthcare infrastructure to ensure conscientious follow up for patients and restore confidence in the system; (4) protects scare resources; and (5) fulfills our moral obligation to our patients and staff.",

Undoubtedly, there are areas beyond VTE where vascular surgeons can and are developing protocols that can help to streamline the care of patients during a time of crisis. During the time of crisis, we can further respond by collating data in an organized fashion, adapting protocols as more is learned and disseminating information rapidly.
