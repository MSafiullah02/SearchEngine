            "text": "Background The worldwide spread of a novel coronavirus disease has led to a near total stop of nonurgent, elective surgeries across all specialties in most affected countries. In the field of aesthetic surgery, the selfimposed moratorium for all aesthetic surgery procedures recommended by most international scientific societies has been adopted by many surgeons worldwide and resulted in a huge socioeconomic impact for most private practices and clinics. An important question still unanswered in most countries is when and how should elective/aesthetic procedures be scheduled again and what kind of organizational changes are necessary to protect patients and healthcare workers when clinics and practices reopen. Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/ procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures. Methods We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed research for all available publications on COVID-19 and surgery and COVID-19 and anesthesia. Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery. Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management. Current recommendations and published protocols on contamination control, avoidance of crosscontamination and procedural patient flow are reviewed. A COVID-19 testing guideline protocol for patients planning to undergo elective aesthetic surgery is presented and recommendations are made regarding adaptation of current patient information/informed consent forms and patient health questionnaires. Conclusion The COVID-19 crisis has led to unprecedented challenges in the acute management of the crisis, and the wave only recently seems to flatten out in some countries. The adaptation of surgical and procedural steps for a riskminimizing management of potential COVID-19-positive patients seeking to undergo elective aesthetic procedures in the wake of that wave will present the next big challenge for the aesthetic surgery community. We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients. New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed. We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare",

Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset.

Taking projections for Spain as example, around April 18 COVID-19-related demand for healthcare resources will first drop below the availability baseline, resulting in a Fig. 1 Flowchart clinical pathway Aesth Plast Surg positive margin with a stable reserve around April 26, which could be considered by healthcare administrators as possible date for re-implementation of elective procedures. As availability of resources and strain on the healthcare system may vary significantly between regions or even between different healthcare structures locally due to some areas being more affected than, the local conditions prevail and may resume in staged reimplementation of elective surgery throughout one country or nation. The American College of Surgeons recommends using local prevalence and incidence rates and to consider a decrease in measures of COVID-19 incidence for at least 14 days before transitioning to provide surgical services for patients without immediately life-or limb-threatening conditions [24, 25] .

These measures should be kept in place at least temporarily, until either the herd immunity is achieved in large parts of the population, the virulence has significantly diminished or a vaccine is available. The recommendations on the subset guidelines presented in this article should not be seen and used as isolated clinical pathways, but should be understood as closely interwoven and influencing each other in significant key aspects. This is why some aspects maybe discussed redundantly in the different protocol sections, as they influence more than one clinical decision pathway. Clinical relevance high-evidence level: moderate",

These antigen assays detect the virus directly without the amplification steps needed for RT-PCR, and like those they are only able to detect current active viral infection [83] . Another testing concern is the variability of viral loads in COVID-19 patients, leading to false-negative antigen detection due to low viral load or sampling variability [96] . Lateral flow tests are more expensive and time-consuming for large batch testing than laboratory-based antibody tests such as ELISA.",

This test can be qualitative or quantitative and is generally a laboratory-based test often taking several hours for results to be available. These tests usually use whole blood, plasma or serum samples from patients. The test relies on a plate that is coated with a viral protein of interest, such as the spike protein. Patient samples are then incubated with the protein, and if the patient has developed COVID-19-specific antibodies (IgG and IgM), they bind together. The bound antibody-protein complex can then be detected with another wash of antibodies that produce a color or fluorescent-based readout. It is a cheap and timeeffective method for batch testing of large numbers of patient samples at the same time.",

Neutralization assays are used to prove if a patient has antibodies that are active and effective against a given virus, even if the patient has already passed the infection. These tests require whole blood, serum or plasma samples from the patient. Neutralization assays depend on cell culture, a laboratory-based method of culturing cells that allow SARS-CoV-2 growth. Virus and cells are cultivated with decreasing concentrations of antibodies to quantify how many antibodies in the patient serum are able to block virus replication. This assay is more important for understanding how antibody tests can be qualified and quantified, and only plays a minor role in the pre-op preparation of patients. Validation and improving sensitivity and specificity of antibody assays are important to limit cross-reactivity. Similar protein structures to other coronaviruses are responsible for this and can lead to false-positive results [90, 97] . These are then further tested and improved with the neutralization tests [98] .",

IgM antibody can be detected as early as day 3 in many infections. Seroconversion (detectable antibodies) in a patient cohort in Germany with mild COVID-19 symptoms occurred in half of all patients by day 7, and in all by day 14 [84] . An Italian paper showed that serological rapid tests are not useful for diagnosing COVID-19 in the acute setting [29] , when the RT-PCR is more useful. Other studies showed that IgM is detectable in samples from 10 to 30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while IgG can be detected from 20 days onward [89] . The IgM response occurs earlier than that of IgG, but then decreases and disappears. While IgG can persist after passed infection for a long time, their protective role in case SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation [88] . Although it appears that recovered COVID-19 patients have antibodies for at least 2 weeks, long-term data are still missing, and it is suggested that antibodies might be present in the blood sample for many months to years. Figure 4 shows this response schematically. More results from current and future studies need to be evaluated in order to improve the accuracy of the diagram shown in relation to COVID-19.",

We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare the elective surgical specialties better for a possible second wave of the pandemic. As it is evident from any socioeconomic viewpoint that we cannot put elective procedures on hold forever, we believe in the need to define adequate clinical protocols to carry out elective procedures in this changed epidemiologic environment. As surgeons performing elective aesthetic procedures, we feel the obligation to weigh in the risk/ benefit ratio for our clinical decisions even stricter than for curative procedures, and this article reflects our view on that commitment toward patient safety.",

In this exceptional circumstance derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, given the high risk of infectious transmission of the virus in unavoidable physical proximity to the patient for medical treatment, it is NOT possible to endure a NULL RISK of transmission of COVID-19, even with all the means of protection available, in addition to those already established. Currently, the biological risk of COVID-19 is still NOT perfectly known from a scientific point of view. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19, nor is there any specific treatment, so curing will depend on the signs and symptoms, whether they are mild, moderate or severe, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, as well as the clinical manifestations that occur. The indications and actions suggested by the corresponding medical team will be interpreted and applied in an individualized manner for each patient, in terms indicated in the previous paragraph, with the prescriptive freedom of each health professional remaining for the benefit of the patient. Particular circumstances of patient conditions with a high risk of transmission of COVID-19, with serious consequences for his/her health include people: over 60, pregnant or immediately postpartum, or diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart of lung disease, immunosuppression (acquired or provoked), or renal or hepatic failure. In this act, the patient acknowledges that with being the subject of medical attention, whether by means of a surgical and/or therapeutic procedure, there is no guaranteed zero risk of acquiring the SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) virus during or after the act, in the recovery phase. In case of acquisition of the virus shortly before, during or after treatment, medical attention or surgical procedure, the clinical evolution may be different and/or the possibility for the development of possible perioperative complications including death may be significantly higher than in COVID-negative patients.",

Anesthesia induction should be performed with a minimum number of HCWs necessary in the OR when intubation is required and a plastic drape should be placed over the head and in chest isolating the intubation area, anesthetist should wear double gloves and PPE [138]. 3. Instruments used during anesthesia and surgery should be sealed in a bag for transporting them to sterilization room. 4. If surgery is performed on the body, a plastic drape should be put under the head and another plastic drape should be placed above the chest to create a tent isolating the face area. For sedation procedures, surgical field/drape may be adapted to cover oral/nasal cavities.(except for eyelid procedures) 5. After surgery is finished, all the bags should be closed to transport reusable instruments. 6. All HCWs should stay at least 1.5 m apart while taking off non reusable PPE and placing it in protected bins. 7. Hand disinfection should be done after surgery and after all reusable PPE has been placed in a plastic box inside OR for decontamination. 8. Not more than one patient should stay in postoperative care area. 9. After determined time, the patient will be transported by HCW wearing PPE to the room 3. Discharge of patient: At discharge, the patient should be discharged from its room directly without necessity to pass by reception. All instructions and medications/prescriptions should be available at time of discharge in the patients room.Reception 1. Office administration 1. Mail and packages: Packages should be delivered at the door and not enter in the clinic. The packages and mail should be put in a closed box to be open by the receptionist in a proper time when the clinic has no patient flow and proper disinfection can be performed 2. Laboratory and pathology: 1. All samples for laboratory analysis and pathology will be kept each with the request inside a sealed bag and all bags inside a closed box. 2. The collection should be booked for the end of day and only once a day. 3. Receptionist should place all small bags in a big sealed bag 4. Receptionist should give the sealed bag to the collector that should be wearing gloves and mask.3. Patient administration:1. Prescriptions 1. Prescriptions: The creams/medications will be handled by the receptionists and put in a bag along with the prescription printed for the aesthetic/consultation patients to take home. For surgical patients, the bag should be left in the room before patient leaves. 2. Payments: Payment should be done in reception preferably with contactless or with card. If not, money and change should be passed on by putting it on the counter, avoid touching of hands when handling money. (Admins staff needs to change or disinfect the gloves after handling money.) In surgical cases, the payment should be ideally done in full by money transfer before surgery, or upon arrival in the facility to avoid that the patient needs to return to reception to pay after surgery. 3.
