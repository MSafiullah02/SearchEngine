            "text": "Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic places healthcare workers at risk of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation. A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Presentation of technique: The materials and assembly process of the novel \"Corona Curtain\" are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities. Results: A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct. The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source. Conclusion: The new \"Corona Curtain\" was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/ emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units. Future validation studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the intubation tents by quantifying the pre\u2212/post-intubation exposure through \"point-of-care\" SARS-CoV-2 testing once these resources are more widely available.",

            "text": "The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposes a significant risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers who take care of infected patients, with high reported mortality rates [1] [2] [3] [4] . Between February 12 and April 9, 2020, nearly 10,000 COVID-19 cases of infected healthcare personnel in the United States were reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with a median age of 42 years [5] . While most infected healthcare professionals are not hospitalized, severe adverse outcomes, including death, have been reported in all age groups [5] . Our current understanding of the mechanisms of viral transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the healthcare setting remains limited [6] . The predominant assumption is that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by droplets or contact from respiratory secretions, however, airborne transmission may occur under certain high-risk circumstances [7] [8] [9] . The general recommendations regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for contact with patients who are either confirmed or suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fluid-resistant gowns, masks, gloves, and goggles [10] [11] [12] . Aerosolizing procedures require wearing full face shields and fit-tested N95 respirators, or alternatively powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) [13] . The high-risk aerosol-generating conditions include noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygenation, nebulizer treatment, sputum induction, bronchoscopy, and endotracheal intubation or extubation [11] [12] [13] . In these specific instances, patients should be isolated in a negative-airflow isolation room, if available, or alternatively be placed in a single isolation room with closed doors [11] [12] [13] . The use of PAPRs provides intuitive benefits over N95 masks combined with face shields, including the comfort of wearing PAPRs during prolonged resuscitations and the additional safety of circumferential coverage with increased protection from accidental contact exposure [13] . In addition, the socalled hazardous materials (\"hazmat\") suits, technically termed \"encapsulated impermeable chemical protective suits\", provide a safe alternative option for emergent intubations and resuscitations in the ED [14] . Practical recommendations and consensus guidelines for protecting staff and providers from aerosol exposure during endotracheal intubations of presumed COVID-positive patients have been presented in multiple recent publications [15] [16] [17] [18] . The recommended safety precautions include the standardized use of video-assisted laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubations to attenuate the risk of aerosol exposure by increasing the distance between provider and patient during the procedure [12, 13, 18, 19 ]. An additional prevalent strategy to decrease the risk of accidental viral exposure during in\u2212/extubation is to limit surgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic by risk-stratification to essential indications exclusively, and to take all necessary precautions in the perioperative management of urgent and emergent cases [20] [21] [22] .",

At our institution, emergent intubations are preferably performed in negative airflow rooms with the intubating physician wearing a \"hazmat\" suit and the assisting ED nurse and respiratory therapist wearing full PPE, goggles, face shields, and N95 masks. We recently introduced an additional safety measure by incorporating novel \"intubation tents\" to all ED bays at our hospital, with the intent of further decreasing exposure to aerosol generation and COVID-19 transmission during emergent intubations.

The clear plastic drapes are precut at the determined length and stored with the other tent materials. The length of the PEX tubes depends on the specific patient needs. We utilize blue PEX tubes at 6 ft length (1.8 m) for standard intubations in patients placed in supine position, which also allows to perform chest compressions, if indicated during a resuscitation. The red PEX tubes are longer, at 10 ft length (3 m), and thereby provide a larger tent size.

Healthcare personnel can reach under the drape, and there is ample space to use a bag valve mask prior to intubating the patient, with the provider standing at the head of the bed and the nurse or respiratory therapist on the side. We recommend to utilize video laryngoscopy for improved visibility and to increase the distance between provider and patient (Fig. 6 ). Our ED physicians' preference is to wear \"hazmat\" suits during emergent intubations (Fig. 7) . The other team members wear standard PPE with N95 masks, goggles, and face shields (Fig. 7) .

Our preliminary experience demonstrates that the standardized approach of using the tents in conjunction with the safety measures described above (i.e. negative airflow room; \"hazmat\" suit for the intubating provider; videoassisted laryngoscope; N95 masks, goggles, face shields, and PPE for the assisting nurse and respiratory therapist) works well in daily practice and has not been associated with any technical concerns or complications. From a cost perspective, the overall price of the PEX tubing, copper materials, and labor for cutting and welding of the copper posts amounted to US $ 285.00 for the first 36 tents implemented at our hospital, which extrapolates to an average price per construct of around US $ 8.00. The price of the plastic drape roll is variable depending on the specific vendor.",
