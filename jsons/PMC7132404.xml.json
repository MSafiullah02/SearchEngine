This is all the more of a problem as African virologists only rarely have the opportunity to attend conferences on emerging viruses in Europe, Asia, or North America. As a result, knowledge about the occurrence of new viruses in Africa is limited, unless there is a major outbreak. For example, the prevalence of dengue virus (DENV) infections in African countries has been barely studied, and it is not known with certainty whether Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women in Africa is connected with the risk of microcephaly of the child (as was the case in the 2015\u20132016 ZIKV epidemic in Central and South America). Furthermore, while African virologists are generally well experienced in diagnostics and epidemiology, knowledge of the molecular biology of emerging RNA viruses is often lacking.",

In the absence of an efficient and safe vaccine against important flaviruses such as DENV1-4 and ZIKV, the investigation of antiviral compounds is crucial for public health. The NS5, a large multifunctional enzyme with two active sites, i.e. the methyltransferase and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sites, is considered a major drug target for antiviral compounds (Lim et al., 2016). The active sites of the NS5 protein are located in the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains, respectively, with allosteric regulation between these two sites. Julien also presented unpublished results on the structure of the full-length NS5 from DENV2 and inhibitor design targeting the N-pocket of the RdRp from ZIKV.",

They first determined a crystal structure for E from ZIKV (Dai et al., 2016) that shows a typical class-II viral fusion protein [as originally defined by (Lescar et al., 2001)]. They selected mAb 2A10G6 that targets the evolutionary-conserved fusion loop (fl) of E for further structural and functional characterization. mAb 2A10G6 can partially protect against a lethal challenge of ZIKV infection and its crystal structure was analyzed (Dai et al., 2018). Following humanization, 2A10G6 could be a candidate for immunotherapy. In the second part of his talk, Lianpan presented a chimpanzee adenovirus-based candidate vaccine against ZIKV (Xu et al., 2018). The rationale for using the chimpanzee adenovirus was to take advantage of the low pre-existing immunity against the carrier in the human population (in contrast to human adenovirus). Adenovirus type 7 was engineered to express the ZIKV M and E proteins. A single vaccination elicited potent neutralizing mAbs and achieved sterilizing immunity in mice (Xu et al., 2018). Further assays using a non-human primate model of the disease are planned using this candidate vaccine.",

Interestingly, three antibodies isolated from a single patient also demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against DENV1-4, which is in line with results reported on other antibodies (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; Tharakaraman et al., 2018). In time-of-addition experiments, these investigators found that the three antibodies provided protection to mice when administered after infection by ZIKV. The epitopes recognized by these mAbs were analyzed by structural studies and found to correspond to tertiary epitopes (contributed by non-contiguous segments in the sequence of the polypeptide chain) (Wang et al., 2017). While the use of a single mAb could not prevent the appearance of virus escape mutants, growing the ZIKV in cell culture in the presence of the three antibodies overcame this issue. In addition, a tri-specific mAb was constructed to present all three antibody binding sites within a single protein construct. Questions were raised by the audience as to the cost and applicability of the approach in a clinical setting, although it was agreed that this strategy was promising. This information will be useful to help the design of vaccines because it provides a mapping at the molecular level of epitopes bound by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies elicited by vaccine candidates can be compared to these pools of antibodies for their ability to confer protection against challenges by the virus.",

While increased viral genome expression in RNase L knock-out (KO) cells compared to wild-type (WT) suggests RNase L-mediated cleavage of the ZIKV genome, knockout of OAS or RNase L genes surprisingly failed to enhance ZIKV replication compared to that in WT cells. Moreover, they observed a modest but significant decrease in ZIKV replication in RNase-L KO cells compared to WT. In contrast to these findings with ZIKV, both the flavivirus DENV, as well as the alphavirus Sindbis replicated to significantly higher titers in RNase-L KO cells compared to WT cells, demonstrating a strong antiviral function carried out by activated RNase L during infection with other viruses. In addition, poly(IC)-mediated activation of RNase L prior to ZIKV infection reduced replication in WT but not RNase-L KO cells, suggesting a mechanism of ZIKV evasion of RNase L during early infection, in which a viral genome reservoir is likely established and protected from RNase L cleavage, allowing for sufficient viral replication. They further found that ZIKV replication factories (RFs) containing viral transcription/replication complexes and dsRNA were more concentrated in their characteristic perinuclear localization in WT cells or in OAS3 KO cells [expressing RNase L but unable to activate RNase L (Li et al., 2016)] as compared to RNase-L KO cells, implying a non-catalytic role for RNase L in supporting ZIKV replication. These data are consistent with a previous report that RNase L interacts with cytoskeleton components and may perform a nonenzymatic role during infection (Malathi et al., 2014). In summary, Susan proposed that RNase L plays a dual role in ZIKV infection \u2013 its canonical antiviral role in degrading viral genomes, as observed with other viruses, and a proviral role currently unique to ZIKV in maintaining optimal virus replication factories.",

Consequently, there is a task for commercial suppliers of providing validated assays and for individual laboratories of developing in-house assays. In this session, Claudia Ohst from EUROIMMUN South Africa gave a presentation on serological arbovirus diagnostics that are available from the company. For many arboviruses, the duration of viremia is relatively short, and serological assays that can detect specific IgG and IgM responses are therefore especially important for the laboratory confirmation of infections. EUROIMMUN provides a broad range of serological assays, either based on ELISA or on immunofluorescence platforms using the BIOCHIP technology. The presentation focused on the development of assays to support diagnostics in the recent outbreak of ZIKV in South and Central America. ELISAs for arboviruses are most frequently based on recombinant antigens. This may in some instances implicate serological crossreactivity. In the case of ZIKV reagents, a recombinant NS1 antigen was produced for the EUROIMMUN ELISA. Based on results obtained from five different groups that screened clinical serum samples from patients with various flavivirus infections, the specificity of the anti-ZIKV IgG and IgM ELISA ranged from 98.7% to 100% (Borena et a., 2017; Granger et al., 2017; Huzly et al., 2016; Kadkhoda et al., 2017; Steinhagen et al., 2016). In patients with suspected ZIKV infection with the so-called \u201coriginal antigenic sin phenomenon, due to a pre-existing antibody response from a previous exposure to another flavivirus, IgM responses to a second and different flavivirus infection may not be detected (Steinhagen et al., 2016). There is some evidence that using combined anti-IgA and IgM tests may resolve this problem and can be applied to identify a recent infection (Steinhagen et al., 2016).",

RT-RPA does not require specialized equipment and can be performed at one temperature using a basic water bath or heating block, hence these assays may have important applications in low-resource settings or in field work. Briefly, a conserved region of the NS5 gene of flaviviruses was targeted and, to determine the application of the assay, primers and probes were initially designed for West Nile virus (WNV). As culturing WNV requires higher biocontainment than available at the facility, RNA was transcribed from a synthetic gene. The transcribed RNA was used to optimize the reaction conditions. Products of the assay were then detected using a lateral flow system. A biotin molecule conjugated to the 5\u2032 end of the probe was used in the reaction specifically to facilitate detection of the products using lateral flow strips that encompassed anti-biotin molecules. The sensitivity of the assay was investigated using ten-fold dilutions of transcribed RNA of known copy number. The minimum detection level was between 5.4 and 54 copies of RNA, in concordance with the results from a conventional RT-PCR reaction. In addition, the specificity of the assay was determined by testing RNA from other flaviviruses or other arboviruses known to circulate in South Africa or imported by travellers. The assay was unable to detect RNA from Sindbis virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), yellow fever virus or Wesselsbron virus. The assay did detect RNA from Usutu virus; however, this was expected due to the sequence similarity. As the aim is to finally develop a multiplex assay for all flaviviruses in southern Africa, this cross-reactivity will be an advantage. Hence, the results confirmed that an RT-RPA can be simply performed at one temperature with rapid detection of products using a lateral flow system.",

During this period, approximately 125 cases of dengue were reported by health authorities in Angola. The peak of the outbreak was in April. Molecular analysis such as RT-PCR and sequencing was used wherever possible to identify the serotype circulating in the country. The most frequently identified serotype was dengue type 2 with 37.3% of identified cases and one case of dengue type 1 was also identified. Analysis of patient demographics suggested that the age group most frequently infected was between 25 and 59 years living in urban areas; more males than females were infected and the majority of cases were reported in patients residing in the capital of Angola, Luanda.

The most abundant mosquito was Aedes aegypti with individuals exhibiting a wide range of variation in the morphological characters associated with the aegypti and formosus forms of this species. Sub-samples were analyzed to identify blood meal sources and mutations affecting insecticide susceptibility. The results showed that Aedes aegypti was highly anthropophilic, with both endo- and exophilic tendencies. Adult mosquitoes were resistant to pyrethroid insecticides, but adults and larvae were susceptible to organophosphates.

She then discussed the molecular mechanisms of alphavirus entry and exit. Alphaviruses including CHIKV and encephalitic viruses are important human and animal pathogens. They are highly organized, enveloped viruses with an internal nucleocapsid containing the plus-sense RNA surrounded by the viral membrane containing an external lattice of the E2 and E1 transmembrane proteins. Virus replication occurs in the cytoplasm and the envelope is derived during budding via a process mediated by the E2 protein and capsid protein interactions and excluding host membrane proteins. Many questions remain, such as how the capsid protein selectively assembles with the viral RNA and the mechanism of viral budding (Brown et al., 2018). Alphaviruses can infect cells as free virus particles or they can be transmitted from infected cells via intercellular \u201cextensions\u201d (Martinez and Kielian, 2016). The extensions are induced by virus infection of the host cell or by expression of the viral structural proteins in the absence of infection. The process of cell-to-cell transmission requires budding of fusion-active viral particles that are transferred to neighboring non-infected cells. These extensions involve the reorganization of the actin and microtubule systems, and can protect the virus from neutralization by host antibodies.",

Both repurposing of antivirals developed for other viruses and cell-based screens for new antivirals against CHIKV were used. An example of repurposing was favipiravir, developed as an antiviral against influenza, and acting broadly on viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). Favipiravir produced strong inhibition of acute CHIKV replication in both cell culture and a mouse model, and acted on nsP4, the viral RdRp. In contrast, no effect in a mouse model of chronic infection was observed, with the results suggesting that in these chronic conditions, either replication and/or the viral RNA was defective (Delang et al., 2016). During the cell-based screens, a class of small molecules ([1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-ones) inhibiting the capping activity of nsP1 was identified (Abdelnabi et al., 2018). In spite of the strong conservation among the nsP1 proteins, the compound showed surprising specificity against CHIKV nsP1 vs. nsP1 of other alphaviruses. Mutations in nsP1 caused resistance, and comparative studies in mosquitoes vs. mammalian hosts emphasized the importance of evaluating the role of the vector in drug resistance and viral fitness.",

SorA inhibits formation of the \u201cmembranous web\u201d, a cellular structure that is generated during and serves as a platform for replication of RNA viruses. Studies showed that SorA inhibits replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and DENV (Koutsoudakis et al., 2015; Fleta-Soriano et al., 2017). A second natural product shown to have broad antiviral activity was the lantibiotic peptide labyrinthopeptin A1 (LabyA1; F\u00e9rir et al., 2013). This molecule displays broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses including flaviviruses and CHIKV. LabyA1 interacts with phosphatidyl ethanolamine in the viral membrane, leading to perforation and virucidal effects. In contrast, cells are relatively resistant to LabyA1, presumably due to decreased accessibility of PE in the cell vs. viral membrane, as well as the ability of cells to carry out membrane repair. It will be interesting to further define the mechanisms of these two antiviral compounds and to explore their ability to act as antivirals in vivo.",

Retrospective investigation of a large serum bank stored at the National Institute of Health showed that arboviruses have been circulating unsuspected for several years in Mozambique and historical data demonstrated that arboviruses were found in Mozambicans since the 1960\u2032s (Gudo et al., 2016a, 2016b). A surveillance system was established in 2015 to monitor the occurrence of arboviruses and other emerging viruses as well as building capacity for early detection of these emerging pathogens. Data from the established surveillance for emerging viruses found cases of dengue, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, hantavirus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever across different sentinel sites (Chau et al., 2017; Mugabe et al., 2018; Muianga et al., 2017; Oludele et al., 2017). These results have driven the establishment of diagnostic capacity for early detection of and rapid response to emerging viruses in Mozambique. Serologic assays were established and establishment of molecular and neutralizing assays is underway at the National Institute of Health. Rapid response teams have been trained on arboviruses and other emerging viruses by the National Institute of Health.",

Her laboratory focuses on the antiviral 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase - ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L) pathway. RNase L is activated by double-stranded (ds) RNA and cleaves host and viral single-stranded RNA and thus downregulates protein synthesis and viral replication. The group demonstrated that accessory protein NS2 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), as well as that of other lineage A betacoronaviruses, is a cytoplasmic protein that displays a 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligo(A) phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity that prevents RNase L activation (Zhao et al., 2012; Goldstein et al., 2017). MHV NS2 is a cell-type and organ-specific virulence factor, required for replication in the liver and the induction of hepatitis, but interestingly, not for replication in the brain and encephalitis.",

In contrast to NS2, NS4b is mainly localized to the nucleus, suggesting a further enzymatic role in that compartment. This is supported by the finding that MERS-CoV mutant viruses expressing either a catalytically inactive NS4b or NS4b expressed in the cytoplasm display similar phenotypes with regard to replication and upregulation of interferon-lambda and interferon-stimulated gene expression. In addition, these data point to a catalytic role for NS4b in the nucleus.

Current knowledge relates conformational changes of the spike protein and exposure of the fusion peptide to low endosomal pH allowing both viruses to enter the cytosol. However, it has become clear that increasing the calcium concentration within endosomes also correlates with infection with both viruses. Susan described how calcium stabilizes the structure of the fusion peptide during conformational changes of the spike and promotes its insertion into the host-cell membrane. Furthermore, her data showed that, as the calcium concentration is increased, lipid ordering increases as well as membrane fusion activity. Higher fusogenic activity linked to higher infection rates are observed in the presence of higher calcium levels.",

A SARS-CoV spike protein encompassing the two-heptad repeat and the pre-fusion FP regions was used to generate monoclonal antibodies in mice.

Interactions were further validated by other methods including mass spectrometry, split-YFP, fluorescence-3-hybrid assay, and gel filtration. The SUD and the PLpro [both embedded in Nsp3 (Lei et al., 2018)] interact with and stabilize an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing RCHY1, which ubiquitinates p53, thereby leading to its degradation (Ma-Lauer et al., 2016). Thus, CoV Nsp3 proteins containing SUD-PLpro counteract the host defense in two distinct manners. Nsp3 leads to p53 degradation by stabilizing RCHY1 and as previously reported, by the direct deISGylation activity of PLpro that interferes with cellular ISGylation (Lindner et al., 2007).",

This approach is possible due to similarities between the substrate-binding sites of enterovirus 3C and CoV main proteases (Hilgenfeld, 2014). Rolf and his colleagues are employing structure-based design of peptidomimetic alpha-ketoamides to be tested as inhibitors for the 3C proteases of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and enterovirus A71, as well as the main proteases of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63.

The opposite is true for direct-acting antivirals: they are less prone to exhibit toxicity based on target, and it is generally easier to build assays and establish PK/PD, the regulatory pathway is usually clearer, but they may lead to development of viral resistance, and depending on structure, may have a limited scope in terms of addressable virus families.",

GS-5734, a phosphoramidate prodrug of a pyrrolo [2,1-f][triazin-4-amino] adenine C-nucleoside, displays EC50 values between 60 and 200 nM against various filoviruses in different cells including human macrophages, but is also active against arenaviruses and coronaviruses (Sheahan et al., 2018; Agostini et al., 2018), while the CC50 is > 10 \u03bcM. During the final stages of the massive 2014\u20132016 EVD epidemic in West Africa, the compound was succesfully used to treat EVD in a newborn child (D\u00f6rnemann et al., 2017) and a relapse in a survivor (Jacobs et al., 2016).",

He analyzed the antigenic profiles, hemagglutinin (HA) sequence information, and susceptibility to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. He found that the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype viruses remained closely related antigenically and genetically to the 2016 vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 and other widely distributed viruses belonging to genetic group 6B. In addition, he also studied the influenza A(H3N2) viruses in Mozambique, the majority of which were antigenically similar to the 2016\u20132017 vaccine virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, and their HA and NA sequences belonged to the 3C.2a subclade that are closely related to viruses circulating in Southern Africa. The influenza B viruses were also antigenically similar to the 2016 season vaccine virus. Overall, Mozambican influenza A and B viruses were most closely related to Southern African viruses and all were sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir. These findings suggest regional circulation of the viruses and highlight the need for continuous epidemiologic surveillance to detect and monitor emerging influenza viruses.",

The majority of poultry production is home-based and there is a lack of rigorous bio-security guidelines, posing the risk of transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans. Her group collected a total of 2132 sera from backyard poultry between 2009 and 2010 and found 8.0% of sera positive for avian influenza type A viruses. The positive sera were further tested for the H5 and H7 subtype viruses, and all of them were negative. As a highly-pathogenic H5N8 outbreak was confirmed in birds in some Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries including the DRC, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, the Veterinary Authority of Mozambique decided to suspend the importation and movement of poultry and poultry products from these affected regions. They also introduced intensive clinical examination and surveillance in larger poultry industries and targeted farms which had imported day-old bird and hatching eggs from infected countries prior to the outbreak. No clinical symptoms were reported. A total of 249 swab samples were tested by qRT-PCR for H5N8 virus and all of them were negative. They also established a new qRT-PCR protocol that detects the M gene, aiming at passive and active avian influenza surveillance. To date, a total of 732 samples were tested, and none was positive.",

They confirmed that the Q226L and G228S amino-acid substitutions are pivotal for the shift in receptor binding, resulting in human receptor-binding features similar to the pandemic H2 and H3 (Song et al., 2017). This implies that swine H4 viruses have the potential to cause human infections. The group also revealed the structural basis for the receptor-binding change, thereby enhancing our understanding of the shift in receptor binding at the atomic level.

Using an in-vitro RNA synthesis assay, they further showed that initiation at position 1U and 3C occurred independently of each other. The polymerase preferred to initiate at 3C, but initiation site selection could be modulated by the relative concentrations of ATP versus GTP. They also showed that the polymerase of human metapneumovirus, another pneumovirus, also initiates at positions 1U and 3C of its promoter. In contrast, the polymerases of the paramyxoviruses, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) and Nipah virus (NiV) only initiate at position 1U of their own promoters, and the EBOV polymerase initiates at position 2C of its promoter. These findings suggest that the different non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses have evolved different initiation mechanisms.",

An approach of computational prediction followed by functional analysis was used to identify immunologic epitopes within the NP and G proteins (Goedhals et al., 2015).

Dog trading practices were thought to be responsible and research was performed to examine the role of Dawacki dog market, a large dog market in Nigeria, in which on average, 3500 dogs are sold on market days.

It was shown that in comparison to the Josiah strain, the Z protein of the Togo strain did not bud efficiently from cells when expressed alone, despite the presence of late domain motifs. The budding activity of the Togo strain Z protein could be enhanced by co-expression of the nucleoprotein NP, whereas NP had no effect on Josiah virus budding. These findings show that different strains of Lassa virus have evolved different budding mechanisms, with varying dependence on NP. The results have implications for antiviral drug design, and emphasize the need to include relevant virus strains in molecular biology studies.",
