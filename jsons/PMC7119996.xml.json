By far, the most widely used technique for POC blood collection is the finger stick, which uses a blood lancet for capillary blood sampling. The technique is widely used for monitoring blood glucose in POC settings and more recently has been used to explore among others early innate transcriptomic responses generated over time after vaccination [13]. Exciting work in this space also includes the demonstration that RNA quality and gene expression data obtained using finger stick collection correlates well with more conventional venipuncture [14], which suggests a strong future for robust nucleic acid analysis at the POC.",

Moreover, as a protective barrier to our bodies, the skin hosts significant immunological machinery and, as such, is an excellent potential tissue for monitoring the state or history of the immune system and infection.

To do so they engineered chemically and mechanically modified microprojection arrays to selectively retrieve protein biomarkers from the skin. With this minimally invasive technique for sampling soluble markers, authors demonstrated the capture of anti-FluVax\u00ae IgG in mice vaccinated with FluVax\u00ae. More recently microprojection arrays have also been developed as a wearable patch for multiplexed sampling of biomarkers directly from the skin of mice [21].\n",

Importantly microprojection\narrays also have the potential to further enable pain-free sample collection and may provide a method for integrating multiplexed sample collection to established paper-based diagnostic platforms. However, important challenges remain to be solved: factors such as (1) the time required to recover samples from the skin (which can take several hours for low-abundance biomarkers [20]); (2) the design of arrays, for instance, the depth at which targeted cell types are found varies between the gender and age of patients, and accordingly the thickness of arrays/projects must be properly calibrated to avoid sampling artifacts; and (3) the analyte type to be harvested by this method. Further, reports to date have been limited to protein-based antigens. Nucleic acid sampling with microneedles/microprojections could greatly improve the development of skin chemistry as a diagnostic target. Interestingly, the recovery and analysis of nucleic acids from microprojections were described in an early patent [22].",

It can be coughed up in a natural way or be induced by inhalation of steam, sterile saline, or glycerin aerosol. Importantly, sputum samples are not saliva samples, which contain large amount of oral bacteria [23] that can contaminate sputum [24]. This complex mixture is part of the immune system that functions as a natural barrier to infection and as such is an interesting fluid to study. The value of sputum as a diagnostic fluid has even been demonstrated through the monitoring of color changes that have been correlated with lung cancer, and bacterial or viral infections. A particularly relevant use of sputum samples in diagnostics has proven to be tuberculosis. Here nucleic acid-based POC tests have been developed for the detection of tuberculosis, efficacy of treatment , and determination of coinfection with HIV [25, 26] [27, 28].",

In many cases the disease involved is an important factor in determining the best sample. Urine, for instance, is one that is easily collected and has shown significant diagnostic value. One timely example of the use of urine is as a sample for molecular diagnostics of the Zika virus. The Zika virus has been found in blood plasma for only a median period of 10 days following infection and this has made the detection of the virus difficult for a disease where most patients are asymptomatic (Jean Michel [29]). Interestingly, Zika virus can be found in patient urine and saliva for as long as 30 days [30]. Whole blood (22 days) and semen (62 days) also appear to provide a greater diagnostic window for Zika virus than plasma [29, 31, 32].",

A simple concentration method based on evaporation and passive pumping was developed by Walker and colleagues using microfluidics [43] where they used evaporation-induced flow to concentrate beads (pathogen proxy) and fluorescently labeled BSA. This concept was recently extended by using heat and the high surface area of paper to augment evaporation for the concentration of analytes in urine [44]. This creative approach was effective at a 20-fold concentration of a urine biomarker (TB-related glycolipid lipoarabinomannan) and it would be interesting to know if a similar approach could be used to concentrate nucleic acids. With longer biopolymers like DNA/RNA it might be possible to capture target molecules at the inflow edge, rather than at the site of evaporation, by essentially using a filtering or chromatography effect.",

As a tool for analyte concentration, Choi and colleagues used DMF to perform solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of steroid hormones from urine. SPME fibers coated with C18 silica particles selectively concentrated the steroid from the complex sample matrix, allowing detection with downstream mass spectrometry analysis. While in this case DMF was not coupled to POC diagnostics, the technique does offer an interesting and potentially economical means of performing complex sample preparation in the field.",

Laboratory-based processing of sputum samples for diagnostics involves chemical (mucolytic agents) or mechanical (sonication, vortexing) liquefaction prior to nucleic acid tests [46]. Very few portable systems have yet to be developed for mucus separation and sample extraction. One exciting example is the Cepheid GeneXpert technology that uses an automated cartridge for the ultrasonic lysis of organisms like captured in a filter. This is followed by PCR-based detection of the pathogen and determination of rifampicin resistance [25, 47]. However the cost of the Cepheid Xpert instrument is not trivial, with a unit cost of at least $17,000 USD [48, 49]. A Phase I SBIR clinical trial has also recently been reported for the development of a new automated POC cassette for processing of sputum samples for nucleic acid extraction; however, the associated costs have yet to be reported (https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/706169). A recent study offers a potentially more accessible and minimally instrumented approach. Here sputum is disinfected and liquefied and then pathogen is mechanically lysed using a battery-operated bead beater. Using this approach DNA could be isolated for qPCR (or POC diagnostics) from spiked TB cultures in under 10 min [26].",

Often the thermal lysis of pathogens is sufficient and lysates can be loaded directly into the diagnostic workflow or analytical device. For example, the thermal lysis of bacterial cells in PCR buffer, followed by PCR amplification and sizing, was performed on a reusable chip in 1998 [55]. More recently, extraction and isolation of Vibrio cholerae from fecal samples were performed using solar-thermal energy. Here, without the need of external electrical power, a stable temperature of 95 \u00b0C was achieved in less than 5 min [56].",

Some of the most commonly used enzyme-based approaches are proteases or lysozyme, which are highly effective but do have limitations for POC applications when pathogen identity is not known. For example, in the case of lysozyme, some bacterial species (e.g., Staphylococcus sp.) have evolved resistance to the glycoside hydrolase in response to the enzyme\u2019s role as an antimicrobial in the innate immune system [57]. An interesting alternative without this limitation is the bacteriolytic enzyme achromopeptidase (ACP ; [58, 59]). As with other proteases this enzyme can cause problems with downstream nucleic acid amplification reactions; however, ACP activity is labile to heat (>80 \u00b0C) so can be easily inactivated, allowing for subsequence molecular steps to be done without purification of nucleic acids. Importantly, ACP is stable dry-stored for easy POC distribution [60, 61].",

Comprised of glass oxide fibers, the membrane has high affinity for DNA and thus serves as a capture agent to allow simple processing steps. Once lysed, the coated membrane is rinsed with NaOH to remove inhibitory proteins (e.g., hemoglobin). The residual NaOH does not inhibit downstream steps and so the DNA-bound membrane can be transferred directly to qPCR for analysis.

The two-stage, credit card-sized device first concentrates cells and then extracts HPV-mRNA for an isothermal amplification-based detection [72]. Microfluidic origami also offers an exciting low-cost extraction option for use in remote settings. Here chemistry-based lysis is merged with a folded paper device that is operated by sequentially bringing taps together to process complex samples. The device was able to extract DNA from samples with as little as 33 bacterial CFU/mL from simulated sputum for an estimated cost of about $2 USD. Sample processing did take between 1 and 1.5 h, with or without heat, respectively, but the device is nonetheless compelling for many applications in global health [73].",

The potential to precisely localize electrolysis has also been exploited for diagnostics. While most lysis methods release analytes into bulk solution, which leads to dramatically lower concentrations for diagnostic assays, Besant and colleagues recently developed a device for the electrolysis of bacteria at a minimal distance to the site of detection [81].

Examples of such enzyme-based amplification include the use of enzymes like horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [90] and alkaline phosphatase [91] to catalyze the generation of optical signal outputs from tests. An exciting new application of HPR signal enhancement was recently reported where the enzyme was used to deposit polydopamine for a high-contrast color-based signal.

Of these, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have a number of features that make them especially well suited to POC diagnostics, and accordingly have become widely used. AuNPs are very stable, which enables distribution and storage either in solution or in a dry powder and, despite the value of gold material itself, only extremely small amounts of the AuNPs are needed for detection. Gold nanoparticles are also easily functionalized with antibodies and other biomolecules and do not fade with exposure to light [103, 104]. Most importantly however, AuNPs have unique optical and electrical properties that make them useful as both visual and electrochemical outputs for diagnostics. The optical properties of AuNPs include a deep color that ranges from deep red to blue, depending on their diameter, that allows for diagnostic outputs to be read directly by the naked eye [103, 105]. For electrochemical assays, antigen-antibody interactions can be used to recruit AuNPs to electrodes, which augments the conductivity of electrode surfaces for diagnostic detection [106].",

However to address some of their limitations, other molecular tools are also being brought to bear in an effort to increase sensitivity, improve specificity, and add new molecular capabilities. Recent work from the field of synthetic biology has contributed to this effort. This includes work of ours, and that of colleagues, with the development of a paper-based diagnostic platform that operates using an isothermal transcription and translation reaction. The approach uses a new type of riboregulator, called a toehold switch\n, as a diagnostic RNA sensor. The necessary enzymes and DNA encoding the toehold switch are embedded into paper and freeze-dried to allow storage and distribution without refrigeration [132, 133]. The freeze-dried paper device is activated by rehydration and the toehold switch DNA is transcribed to form an RNA hairpin at the 5\u2032 end of a reporter mRNA. In the presence of target RNA, the hairpin of the toehold switch becomes linear, which allows ribosomes to bind for the translation of a reporter enzyme. Here the translation of the \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme catalyzes a visible color change on the paper in as little as 20 min after rehydration. As part of the proof-of-concept work, diagnostics for the strain-specific detection of the Ebola virus (Zaire vs. Sudan) and antibiotic resistance were demonstrated.",

This led to a follow-up work in May 2016 that reported a portable molecular diagnostic for the Zika virus [54]. The similarity between Zika and Dengue viruses causes cross-reactivity in serological assays for patient antibodies and so, with the outbreak in Latin America, there was great need for a portable molecular diagnostic for the virus. To solve the challenge with sensitivity, isothermal amplification was added in the workflow upstream of the toehold switch. By combining isothermal amplification with the toehold switch, not only was there an increase in signal amplification and sensitivity, but importantly this also addressed the general problem of false positives for isothermal amplification. In this configuration the detection of isothermal amplification products is now contingent on the second sequence-dependent toehold switching event for a paper-based color change.",

This is an important feature that accounts for the constant evolutionary drift in pathogen genomes, meaning that toehold switches designed for first sequenced American strain of the Zika virus (2016) are also, in theory, capable of detecting all strains of the virus since its discovery in 1947 while still distinguishing from closely related Dengue virus isotypes.",

They provide robust and reliable performance, but are limited to a single diagnostic function and are not easily adapted to complex multistep processes. However, as we have discussed throughout the chapter, innovative researchers are extending paper materials to these more complex tasks. In an early example of this, Martinez and colleagues developed a 3D microfluidic paper analytical device (\u03bcPAD)\nby stacking layers of wax-patterned paper to allow for more complex molecular processes and multiplexing (fluid distribution into arrays with >1000 zones) while keeping simplicity in fabrication and cost low [144].

Just as molecular technologies and nanomaterials promise to replace equipment by providing lower temperature diagnostic regimes and signal amplification, DMF promises to dramatically simplify low-cost fluid handling and automation of complexity. Through an array of patterned electrodes, DMF uses the application of an electrical field to dispense, move, and mix microdroplets (pico- to microliters) in a chip [147]. While most microfluidic devices rely on external pressure sources, pumps, continuous flow, and large amount of samples or reagents, DMF technology enables savings in reagents, sample, and therefore cost. In 2004, Srinivasan et al. [148] were able to actuate by electrowetting, human physiological samples like whole human blood, serum, plasma , urine, saliva, sweat, and tear as well as perform a glucose assay. The flexibility of DMF enables functions like sample separation and extraction, for example, with the use of mixing areas with lytic agents or heating zone on a single device. In 2009 Mousa et al. [149] successfully separated and extracted estradiol from breast tissue, whole blood, and serum and in 2015 Ng et al. [150] presented a proof of concept for the use of DMF as a diagnostic platform for detection of infectious diseases. The demonstration was performed with a fully integrated sample preparation for the detection of rubella infection. The shoebox-sized automated platform was able to aliquot, dilute, and multiplex four parallel assays as well as deliver an automated digital readout of the assay. Recent work has combined DMF with paper (paper-DMF) to create cheap, fast, complex, and multiplexed diagnostic devices [151] using conductive silver ink on paper.",

Thus, the paper-DMF platform can provide sequential flow of the sample and reagents, as well as complex multistep processes, without any intervention of the user. Importantly, recent advances in the manufacture of DMF devices, with roll-to-roll production, have brought device cost down to $0.63 USD per chip [152]. Finally, a device called the DropBot has recently been released as an open-source platform for controlling droplet actuation in DMF [153]. Open-source hardware and software is an important new trend for diagnostics that allows anyone to build and modify companion devices for their own needs.

The ASSURED criteria will provide ongoing guidance to the development of relevant tools, but of course it is important to recognize that each design feature should be considered in the context of the intended POC environment. In other words, the intended application of an ideal diagnostic device must be considered from the outset of design. When cost is not the main limiting factor to deployment, ultrarapid, self-contained disposable cassettes may be ideal. However in well-established but poor urban environments, other factors such as time or convenience may be less of a constraint on design in favor of being able to provide clinical-grade results. There may even be a future for applications where even sensitivity or specificity can be sacrificed in favor of strategies in which multiplexed detection and low cost provide redundancy for diagnosis of complex disease (e.g., paper-based gene expression profiling; [158]). The key is that without a final set of applications and target population in mind, the complete design space available to build practical portable diagnostics may not be recognized (Fig. 6.1).\n",

(1) Sample preparation technologies that are portable and cost effective are perhaps the most critical to the success of our field as well as the compatibility of the preparation, extraction, and analysis steps. It is this capability that will convert innovative assays into field-ready tools. Here we see digital/microfluidics as key to implementing low-cost and automated workflows that can be used by nonexperts under field conditions. (2) Nucleic acid amplification and other molecular technologies will be an increasing source of capability for POC diagnostics as researchers incorporate new techniques and enzymes, as well as methods for deployment without refrigeration. (3) Materials engineering and nanotechnologies will also provide exciting and increasingly cost-effective ways of moving laboratory assays to the field.",

This potential boon in capabilities could not come at a better time. The human population is growing at a rate of 1.6 million every week, and so, with such growth, our ability to provide timely access to health care will increasingly depend on distributed care through portable tools of diagnosis. Moreover, this drive to reduce cost and extend access to health care is something that will be globally beneficial and our challenge as a field will be how to meet such diverse needs. And it is through this lens that we suggest that the journey to the ideal device(s) has many paths.",
