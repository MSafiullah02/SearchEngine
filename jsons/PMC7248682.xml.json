Our worlds can feel eerily quiet and small when mandated to work and school\nfrom home, avoid restaurants and bars, and stay at a six-foot distance from others\nfor weeks or months to come. Physical distancing can certainly be experienced as a\npsychological distancing without intentional efforts to offset the isolation. Health\ncare professionals are well aware of these mental health consequences; they\nencourage frequent virtual check-ins with one another\u2014particularly those that are\nmost vulnerable to COVID-19, such as our beloved elders\u2014to preserve our sense of\nintimate community bonding in this time of self-quarantining.",

Historically, music\nhas been used by people to remain motivated, resilient, and united in the face of\ncollective challenge, from the Sea Shantis that sailors in the 18th\ncentury chanted together as they labored to weather harsh ocean tides, to the\nfreedom songs sung by the Black community in the 20th century amid the tiring fight\nfor civil rights. Tracey Nicholls\n(2014) writes about music\u2019s emotional power to join people in solidarity\nand build movements together:it is because of the way music feeds into our emotional lives and because of\nthe sense of social well-being we get from sharing emotional states with\nothers that music so frequently accompanies movements that build, and depend\nupon, solidarity.",

            "text": "In this time of coronavirus, examples of therapeutic music-making unceasingly flow.\nAs a psychology professor who teaches art therapy, my undergraduate students and I\nwere supposed to do a music therapy lesson last week and engage in an\nimprovisational jam-session together in the classroom. Each student was invited to\nbring an object that can serve as an instrument, be it a guitar or harmonica or\nspoons or their voice. To comply with the social distancing mitigation strategy\nrecommended by health care organizations, we decided to move the class online via\n\u201cZoom meetings\u201d as a last-minute plan. Yet social distancing did not impede our\nmusical solidarity. Instead, the 20 students and I experimented with a virtual,\nimprovisational, jam session to join our spirits in a fun rhythmic flow. Of course,\nthe rhythm was slightly delayed because of the Internet\u2019s lag-time. Of course, our\nharmony could not find perfect synchronization through our laptops and phones. Yet\nstill we sang together, clapped together, strummed together, and laughed together,\naccessing a primal mode of communal being-together through collective sound making\nacross our individual screens. Our improvisational virtual jam session brought us\nenough joy and love to overpower the terror of COVID-19 for just a little while! But\nthe next day I awoke to something all the more moving: one of the most poignant\ndemonstrates of musical solidarity I have ever seen. A video was circulating of the\npeople in Italy, who are currently undergoing a national quarantine because of the\nrapid, uncontainable spread of the infection across their nation at a capacity that\nfar overwhelms their health care capacities and has led to dire life-and-death\ndecisions in the hospitals (with warning that the United States may follow suit if\nwe do not social distance now). The situation in Italy is tragic;\nthere can be no denying the collective trauma among COVID-19 patients and health\ncare providers and self-isolated citizens alike. And yet this video of the Italians\nconveys unbridled joy (viewable at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r357UgH7hU). The video captures\nthem congregating on the balconies of their apartments, strumming and shaking\nwhatever instruments are available to them, and joining the voices to sing together\ninto the wide open air. They are laughing, dancing, and clapping in celebration of\none another. It brings the viewer to tears to witness such a delightful display of\ncommunity; it brings me close to tears to write this even now. The antidote of\nmusical solidarity in a time of coronavirus provides a joyful reminder of the deep\nhuman will to always find our way back to one another. Even a nationwide quarantine\nor a deadly pandemic cannot prevent us from connecting and supporting each other\nthrough life\u2019s darkest hours. Since this video of the Italians\u2019 impromptu concert\nwent viral, social media has become abundant with musicians generously sharing\n\u201cvirtual concerts\u201d for the general public to watch from the safety of their homes,\nsuch as members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, John Legend, Coldplay, and many\nof my musical friends on Facebook. In the days to come, I imagine these bonds of\nmusic will exponentially grow to remind each of us that we are not alone.",

In the United States, at the time of writing this essay, many of\nus can also not yet see the tragic effect of the disease on our\ncommunity members or loved ones, with the exception of the major epicenters of the\noutbreak such as Washington and New York. At this point, the pandemic remains\nshrouded in invisibility to most American eyes, lest we find the courage to watch\nnews clips of the traumatic hospital scenarios in China and Italy. Similar to a\npsychological understanding of climate change apathy, it is difficult to hold\ntangible concern for a future calamity that appears intangible to us in present day.\nThus, health care professionals\u2019 pleas for American citizens to take seriously the\nadoption of health precautions and social distancing practices can fall on apathetic\nears and eyes. What can help people reverse apathy and confront reality is the\nrestoration of vision\u2014of literally seeing the coronavirus and its\nimpact on us and our loved ones: \u201cvision is . . . one of the means by which we\ninteract with and relate to the world, and by increasing our visual awareness, we\nextend and intensify our relationship to life\u201d (McNiff, 1981, p. 155).",

            "text": "Prior to most countries enforcing or strongly encouraging social distancing, it is\namazing to witness the coronavirus street art that sprung up as if overnight. In\nLondon, street artist Pegasus painted a mural on a street corner featuring Prime\nMinister Boris Johnson urging people to stop panic-buying supplies in grocery stores\nas they prepare to social distance, he wanted to remind them to be considerate to\nothers during this crisis. In Rome, street artist Laika painted a mural above a\npopular restaurant to address the ignorance and xenophobia toward Chinese people in\nItaly as a result of COVID-19; the image includes a Chinese woman dressed in\nsurgical attire and a face mask with a speech bubble that reads: \u201cThere\u2019s an\nepidemic of ignorance going around . . . we must protect ourselves!\u201d In Naples,\nartist Nello Petrucci erected a giant street mural of the Simpsons\nfamily wearing face masks on their couch with the words \u201cSTAY HOME!\u201d spray-painted\nonto the image. From within their homes, adults and children are transforming\nboredom into creativity by crafting their own images to share with the public. In\nItaly, many quarantined families hang colorful, painted banners outside their\nbalconies with words of encouragement such as: \u201candra tutto bene\u201d meaning\n\u201ceverything will be fine.\u201d In the United States, where a national quarantine has not\n(yet) been administered, the visual arts are embraced to make the invisible visible,\nremind Americans of the gravity of the situation, and offer encouragement and\nprecaution. I painted an acrylic painting called \u201cSocial Distancing Blues,\u201d which\nvisualizes the coronavirus hovering across the sky in bright red paint outside my\napartment windows. I shared the image on social media as a public service\nadvertisement with the message: \u201cEven though the virus looks pretty from afar, don\u2019t\ntrust it! Stay at home, folks!\u201d A few days later my mother, a senior citizen who is\nin the high-risk category of COVID-19, was inspired to create her own graphic image\nas a public service announcement. She used the phone app Bitmoji to create a comic\nstrip of herself as a cartoon character social distancing. In the comic strip, she\noffers healing greetings and safety strategies to help others cope with COVID-19:\n\u201cGood day.\u201d \u201cThinking of you all.\u201d \u201cAre you ok?\u201d \u201cI am social distancing cuz I want\nto listen to the CDC advice and so should you,\u201d \u201cWash your hands!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t touch your\nface!\u201d \u201cNature walks,\u201d \u201chealing through the Internet,\u201d \u201cNo peeking at the 401k,\u201d\n\u201cHang in there!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d \u201cWe can do it!\u201d What is so moving about these\nexamples is that in the process of making and sharing coronavirus art, a shift seems\nto occur where we become empowered to do something about the\nCOVID-19 crisis. We seem to be creating images to help slow the virus down, spread\nreminders of kindness, and nurture collective resiliency. Just as McNiff suggested\nthat placing a troublesome experience into an artistic container can transform our\nrelationship to it, making visual art about coronavirus and social distancing can\nhelp transform collective anxiety into collective support and action. Thus, this\ntime in history may forever be memorialized as a moment of precious human\nsolidarity.",

Cinematherapy is the intentional use of movie\nviewing to gain self-insight and psychological transformation, as audiences\u2019\nemotions and perspectives transform while watching a movie (Berg-Cross et al., 1990; Sharp et al., 2002). Most\nfilms offer narratives with a reliable temporal structural\u2014a\nbeginning in which a conflict emerges, a\nmiddle during which the crisis is grappled with, and an\nending during which the conflict is resolved. If we watch a\nmovie whose crisis is similar to our own, we can find incredible catharsis and\nrelief by witnessing a resolution to our crisis offered by the movie\u2019s storyline.\nMoreover, because movies are a multisensory experience, they can evoke the full\nspectrum of emotion about a situation onscreen. Cinema\u2019s ability to express strong\nemotion through sight, sound, and motion can offer emotional catharsis and\ncontainment for audiences, allowing us to externalize our own inner suffering by\nviewing it onscreen; the movie offers a \u201ccontainer\u201d for our strong emotions. Aside\nfrom watching movies, cinematherapy also includes therapeutic filmmaking\ninterventions: ordinary people can shoot, edit, and produce videos and films that\nexpress their difficult psychological experiences (Johnson & Alderson, 2008). It can be\nempowering to \u201ccontrol the narrative\u201d by making a film of one\u2019s own. Making movies\nhelps us restore agency, gain mastery, and reduce the anxiety that corresponds with\nfeeling out of control in crisis situations.",

            "text": "An interesting trend during this coronavirus crisis has been the plethora of people\nflocking to watch the 2011 fictional film Contagion on their movie\nstreaming platforms. Contagion is a movie about a deadly fictional\npandemic named MEV-1 whose outbreak kills 26 million people worldwide. The virus in\nthe film kills 25% to 30% of people who catch it, as opposed to the 2% of COVID-19.\nDespite this significant difference, Contagion is nevertheless a\npretty terrifying flick to watch at this time; the film gruesomely depicts the\nhealth and social impacts of a deadly pandemic. So why has it become one of the top\nmovies streamed from Netflix and iTunes since our own pandemic broke loose\u2014a film\nwhich appears more and more like a medical documentary than fictional thriller each\nday? Because despite the massive death toll that the film depicts, the movie ends\nwith a vaccine developed which effectively immunizes human beings from MEV-1.\nDespite the emotional rollercoaster the audience endures as the film world explodes\nbecause of a deadly pandemic\u2014an emotional journey that likely mirrors what we will\nexperience as the pandemic develops in our real world\u2014by the end of the movie, the\naudience can breathe a sigh of relief as the crisis is resolved and daily life\nreturns to normal. Thus, Contagion offers audiences a cathartic\ncontainer for our panic, a sense of control to combat uncertainty, and hope for\nwhat\u2019s to come. Aside from the healing power of watching movies, agency and hope can\nalso be discovered by therapeutic filmmaking in this time of coronavirus. I will\nagain reference the magnificent art pouring from the Italians amid their current\nsituation of enforced national quarantine. A filmmaking collective in Milan called A\nTHING BY recently created a video compilation of Italians talking to their \u201cformer\nselves\u201d from 10 days ago, which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_cImRzKXOs&feature=youtu.be.\nThe Italians in the video have a dialogue with the camera of what they wish they\ncould tell themselves 10 days ago: \u201cHello Daniele-from-10-days-ago. Are you scared?\nNah? I\u2019m speaking to you from the future. I know you\u2019re busy, but wait a second. I\nwant to update you on Italy\u2019s latest. A huge mess is about to happen . . . \u201d The\nvideo showcases Italians imploring their former selves to take seriously the threat\nof the virus, such that they can adopt social distancing and health precautions\nbefore it is too late. While they cannot turn back time, I imagine this video was\ncathartic to make by providing an expressive container for feelings of regret and\ndespair. Moreover, the Italians may regain agency and control in making this video,\nfor it is being shared by the CDC in the United States to warn Americans of what\u2019s\nto come if they make the same mistake. Through therapeutic filmmaking, the Italians\nmay experience empowerment by helping the rest of the world avert the crisis that\nthey themselves endured. As the pandemic spreads across the world, I imagine in-home\nvideo production will be embraced as significant therapeutic vehicle as we\ncollectively seek to tell the story of our time.",
