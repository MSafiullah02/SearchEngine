Blood product availability is dependent on blood donation and availability of appropriate storage conditions and thus is a potentially limited resource. Since traditional blood products are obtained from human donation, they also have the potential issues of immunologic reactions and vectors of blood borne illness. The study of the ideal resuscitative product for patients in shock has become an area of great scientific interest and investigation. The purpose of this article is to review contemporary resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock, with a focus on blood products and blood product components. Additionally, existing concerns with regard to the risks of blood product transfusion, and how those risks may be mitigated with scientific advancements, specifically pathogen reduction technologies, will be highlighted.

            "text": "Normal saline, lactated Ringer's and PlasmaLyte are the primary crystalloid solutions used in clinical practice. Sodium chloride (normal saline) is the most commonly used crystalloid on a global basis.5 Normal saline (0.9%) contains 154mMol of Na and Cl respectively, thus making it isotonic when compared with extracellular fluid. The strong ion difference of normal saline is zero, which leads to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis when administered in large volumes. Adverse immune and renal effects have also been attributed to this phenomenon.6 As a result of these potentially harmful effects, the use of \u201cbalanced\u201d salt solution crystalloids such as Ringer's lactate and PlasmaLyte that are thought to be more physiologic are now being increasingly utilized. Balanced salt solution crystalloids are in fact crystalloid solutions that contain a buffer (such as lactate) to maintain the acid-base status as well as additional electrolytes (magnesium, potassium, calcium). The use of buffered solutions is associated with less metabolic derangement, hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis and as a result, their use has been favored in the clinical setting. Although these balanced salt solutions are thought to be superior to normal saline, they are not without issues. Despite having fewer effects on pH, balanced salt solutions have been shown to lead to coagulopathy, tissue edema (particularly problematic in the setting of traumatic brain injury and acute lung injury), and other detrimental physiologic effects.7, 8, 9\n",

Albumin is the most commonly used colloid and much of its clinical use is based on its capacity to act as a plasma expander as a result of increased intravascular oncotic pressure. However, broad usage of albumin as a resuscitative fluid has not been supported by clinical and scientific evidence. Albumin has been shown to be an ideal fluid for resuscitation of patients with liver cirrhosis and other conditions related to liver failure, and is generally considered safe for resuscitation of critically ill patients, except those with traumatic brain injury.10 The use of hydroxyethyl starch solutions has been associated with increased rates of renal-replacement therapy, bleeding, and mortality, and has largely fallen out of favor as a result.11 Until recently, Hextend\u00ae (6% hetastarch in lactated salt solution) was the preferred resuscitative fluid in the absence of blood products by the United States military due to its smaller volume and potential for prolonged evacuations.12 However, the newest Damage Control Resuscitation Clinical Practice Guideline has removed Hextend\u00ae from the guideline.13 Gelatins are another synthetic colloid solution, however, they have not been widely adopted due to safety concerns.14\n",

            "text": "In more recent years, the use of blood products and more commonly, blood components, have become the preferred method of resuscitation for patients in hemorrhagic shock.15 Whole blood transfusions historically were the principal resuscitative fluid for hemorrhagic shock, beginning as early as World War I. During the Korean and Vietnam wars low titer Group O whole blood (LTOWB) was used extensively (along with some cases of non-Group O blood as requirements for blood increased).16 However, after the Vietnam era, blood was replaced by crystalloids and colloids as the primary resuscitative fluid for hemorrhagic shock, in both the military and civilian setting.17 This was partially due to the risks associated with blood transfusion, such as transmission of infectious disease, but also related to research indicating that the interstitial compartment or \u201cthird space\u201d required resuscitation with crystalloid for adequate tissue perfusion.17\n,\n18 By the early 1970s, whole blood had virtually disappeared from use. Instead, patients who received blood transfusions received unbalanced component therapy, in which red blood cell (RBC) to plasma ratios often reached 10:1, with platelets given even less frequently. Many patients during this era also were resuscitated with large volumes of crystalloid fluid before receiving any blood products. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this resulted in dilutional coagulopathy, interstitial edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure in many patients.16\n,\n19 Today, the pendulum has swung back towards a blood-based resuscitation strategy for patients with life threatening hemorrhagic shock. Bleeding patients are now recommended to receive minimal crystalloid and the results of the PROPPR trial have encouraged a 1:1:1 use of RBCs, plasma, and platelets, attempting to recreate whole blood with balanced component transfusion (Fig. 1\n).20\n",

In military settings, in which formal testing for transfusion transmitted diseases is often not possible, whole blood is collected from pretested donors (tested every 90 days during deployment) and stored at 22 \u00b0C for up to 8 h and then at 4 \u00b0C for a maximum of another 24 h; this is termed warm fresh whole blood.16 In the civilian setting, whole blood can be stored without agitation at 2\u20136 \u00b0C for up to 35 days if collected in the proper citrate solution. A number of studies have shown that transfusion of whole blood is safe, feasible, and may increase survival for some patients in hemorrhagic shock.16\n,\n19\n,\n21, 22, 23 Whole blood also offers a logistical advantage in that it allows for simplification and streamlining of the massive transfusion process and may even decrease administrative errors that occur during the chaos of massive component transfusion. However, transfusion of whole blood is not without risks. Only about 8% of the US blood donor population is group O-, making these \u201cuniversal donor\u201d whole blood units scarce.24 A number of studies have shown that it is feasible and safe to transfuse O+ whole blood, however, the risk of alloimmunization remains a concern.23\n,\n25\n,\n26 However, only a small number of women of childbearing age are transfused. Furthermore, the risk of becoming alloimmunized to the D antigen (+/\u2212 blood type) is approximately 22% and the risk is smaller yet for hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies.24 In contrast, the mortality rate for patients in hemorrhagic shock who require a laparotomy is 40% and the mortality rate for combat causalities requiring blood transfusion is 16%.19\n,\n24 It is also possible to leukoreduce whole blood, which may decrease the risk of alloimmunization. Leukoreduction does deplete total platelet count and it is currently unclear whether leukoreduction leads to a change in platelet hemostatic function post filtration, however, leukoreduced whole blood may be a viable resuscitation option for select patients in hemorrhagic shock. This data suggests that although the risk of alloimmunization should remain a consideration, there is probably a larger potential benefit of having O + LTWB available for all hemorrhagic shock patients, male and female.",

Even with this shift in practice, red blood cells remain the most commonly requested transfusion product worldwide.27 RBCs are most commonly transfused for acute blood loss, symptomatic anemia and sickle cell crisis. Red blood cell units are prepared from donated whole blood by removing the plasma fraction after centrifugation. Preservative solutions are then added to the RBCs to improve their quality and shelf life. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved storage of red blood cells for up to 42 days at 2\u20136 \u00b0C.28 However, despite preservative solutions, storage time influences the quality of the RBC unit as it ages, which has been termed the storage lesion. Several studies have shown that RBC storage lesion may lead to potential unwanted clinical outcomes such as acute lung injury and a higher mortality rate.27\n,\n29 Cryopreservation of RBCs may be one way to circumvent the storage lesion, allowing for preservation of RBCs for up to ten years when stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Several studies have recently shown that cryopreserved RBCs may even be superior to traditionally stored RBCs in regards to inducing inflammation and fibrinolysis.30, 31, 32 However, Chang et al. reported that cryopreservation accelerated the red cell storage lesion.33 Finally, red blood cells have an associated universal donor type, O-, meaning that they lack the A and B antigens as well as the Rh antigen on the surface of the cells; thus allowing for transfusion to a patient with any blood type.",

AB is the universal donor type for plasma, as it lacks anti-A and anti-B antibodies. However, only 4% of the population is AB, resulting in a chronic shortage of universal donor plasma.34 Transfusion of plasma has also been associated with transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). TRALI is the most common cause of transfusion related death. TRALI has been associated with antibodies found in the plasma of multiparous females and thus, many countries have eliminated or restricted the use of plasma from female donors, resulting in decreased incidence of TRALI.40 In fact, recent trauma studies report a near absence.20\n,\n41\n",

Platelet concentrates can be isolated from donated whole blood or obtained by apheresis, in which platelets are harvested but all other cells are returned to the donor. The viability of stored platelets is dependent on temperature, pH, constant agitation, and the gas-permeability of the storage bags.42 Traditionally, platelets have been stored at 22 \u00b0C in an effort to preserve function. However, storage at this temperature facilitates bacterial growth, leading to a short shelf life, typically five days. Some settings have instituted pathogen screening and reduction technologies, extending the shelf life to seven days.43 Recently, data in the trauma population has raised the question of the optimal storage temperature for platelets.44 Exposure of platelets to 4 \u00b0C versus 22 \u00b0C has been known to result in poor recovery and shorten platelet life span.45 However, recent work has shown that aggregation and adhesion seem equivalent or better with refrigerated platelets, and cold platelets form stiffer clots in both in vivo and in vitro studies.42 Refrigerated platelets therefore may become a viable transfusion therapy for patients undergoing surgery or suffering from hemorrhagic shock, conditions in which hemorrhage control is of greater importance that prolonged platelet survival. In 2017, the FDA approved cold storage for apheresis platelet concentrates for use in active hemorrhage.42 Newer platelet-derived products are being investigated such as platelet-derived extracellular vesicles, which in a preclinical study by Miyazawa et al. demonstrated equivalent control of blood loss as traditional platelets.46\n",

Transfusion reactions are defined as \u201cadverse events associated with the transfusion of whole blood or one of its components.\u201c.59 The majority of transfusion reactions are minor; however, they must be evaluated promptly, as some may be life threatening or fatal. The timing of transfusion reactions is variable, and they may occur acutely or days to weeks later. Transfusion reactions may or may not be immunologic and include hemolytic, febrile non-hemolytic, anaphylactic, simple allergic, septic, TRALI, and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).59\n,\n60 Mild allergic reactions are due to hypersensitivity to a foreign protein present in the donor blood product. Anaphylactic reactions are similar but a more severe hypersensitivity reaction. They can sometimes occur in an IgA deficient patient who receives blood products containing IgA. Febrile non-hemolytic reactions are thought to be caused by cytokines released from donor leukocytes.59 Septic reactions are caused by blood products that have been contaminated by bacteria or bacterial products such as endotoxin. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are often due to the presence of recipient antibodies to blood donor antigens. TRALI is thought to be caused by antibodies in the donor product, specifically human neutrophil antigen or human leukocyte antigen, which react with recipient antigens. The recipient immune system responds to these antibodies and this ultimately leads to pulmonary edema. TACO may occur when the volume of transfused blood product leads to hypervolemia. Careful testing for compatibility, monitoring of patients during transfusion and restriction of certain blood product donors has helped to mitigate these risks.40\n,\n60\n",

Nonetheless, transfusion transmitted infections make up approximately 10\u201315% of transfusion associated mortality.61 Bacterial contamination of platelets and septic transfusion reactions remain a major source of transfusion related morbidity and mortality, as up to 1:1000 units of platelets are bacterially contaminated.62 Additionally, the possibility remains that emerging pathogens may contaminate the supply of blood products and pose yet unknown risks to patients. During an outbreak of Zika virus in 2013 and 2014 in French Polynesia, the potential for transmission via blood transfusion was revealed when 3% of blood donors were found to test positive for the disease.63 In fact, at this time it is unknown whether the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, can be transmitted via blood transfusion.64\n,\n65 Until recently, the medical community has dealt with infectious threats to the safety of the blood product supply reactively, which inevitably has led to years-long delays in effectively containing such pathogens and mitigating these risks.66 As a result, emerging pathogens pose a major threat to the supply of safe blood products. However, newer blood product technologies aim to reduce these risks in a more proactive manner. Specifically, researchers are working to develop technologies that would allow for the empiric reduction of pathogens in blood components used for transfusion. Two products are currently FDA approved (INTERCEPT\u00ae and OctaplasLG\u00ae), while another is currently seeking FDA approval (Mirasol\u00ae).",

However, the potential savings that may be subsequently realized from improved safety of blood transfusions and other downstream reductions in healthcare expenditures are unknown. Pathogen reduction technologies may allow for reductions in adverse transfusion events and decreases in laboratory screening interventions. Additionally, current donor selection criteria, which is both complex and costly, reduces the available blood product supply substantially. Pathogen reduction technologies may allow for additional safety and subsequent loosening of donor selection criteria as well as elimination of some existing donor screening assays and product modifications.106 Finally, as emerging pathogens such as the recent SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the supply of blood products, pathogen reduction technologies may allow for continued safe transfusion of these products, even in the absence of available and reliable nucleic acid testing for emerging viruses and other pathogens. Moving forward, more studies are needed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pathogen reduction technologies along with careful accounting of what adverse events can be prevented and what healthcare costs can be diminished with their implementation.105\n",
