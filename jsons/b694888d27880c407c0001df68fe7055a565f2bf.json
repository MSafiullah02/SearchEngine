Involvement of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis by SARS-CoV-2 is currently an actively pursued research area. An increased susceptibility to infection in individuals with DM, HT and CVD together with higher levels of circulating ACE2 in these settings presents a scenario where interaction with soluble ACE2 may result in disseminated virus-receptor complexes that could enhance virus acquisition and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has impacted around 1.7 million people with more than 10000 deaths from 210 countries across the globe so far (Zhu N et al, 2020 ; ; CSSE, Johns Hopkins University). As of 11 th April 2020, India has 6565 active cases, 239 deaths with 642 individuals who have been documented to have recovered (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India; https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). All these figures are expected to escalate rapidly. Several clinical and epidemiological studies reporting on COVID-19 have linked comorbidities such as diabetes (DM), hypertension (HT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) with increased risk of infection leading to increased mortality (Guan W et al, 2020; Fang L et al, 2020) . Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is widely expressed by several organs including the oral mucosa, lung, intestine, kidney, blood vessels, and on immunoreactive cells (Zou X et al, 2020) . Elevated levels of ACE2 could potentially result in increased susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Xu H et al, 2020) . Patients with DM, HT and CVD, which seem to be the most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, are typically treated with drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). RAS inhibitors are very commonly used not only for management of blood pressure but also for protection from disease-associated inflammation and organ remodelling (Simoes ESAC et al, 2016) . A consequence of this therapy, increased levels of ACE2, including its cell-free soluble form are observed in these individuals (Vuille-dit-Bille RN et al, 2015; Hoffmann M et al, 2020) . The high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 and these comorbidities prompted us to probe the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 attaches and interacts with membrane bound and cell free forms of ACE2.",

Furthermore, we observed the overall interface region of ACE2 which comes in close contact with INS1 and INS2. Interestingly, within ACE2 charged residues seem to play a critical role in these interactions. Of the ten interactions observed, seven were negatively charged while three were positively charged (Table 2 ). Next, we analysed the interaction between complete ACE2 and INS2. There were three salt bridges observed between INS2 and ACE2 along with twelve hydrogen bonds. Within the interface of ACE2 there were five negatively charged and five positively charged residues which come in direct contact with INS2 ( Figure 4b and Table 2 ). Docking of sACE2 with INS1 and INS2 (Figure 4c and d) showed that HADDOCK score of sACE2 with INS1 was higher than that of INS2 (Table 1 ).",

To begin with, we confirmed with Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences that a stronger interaction with ACE2 exists compared to the SARS-CoV with ensuing implications for higher infection rates and transmission as has been reported recently (Chen Y, et al., 2020) . A preliminary analysis of the two S1 sequences from India, that has witnessed introductions of the virus into the population from geographically distinct sources, reveals two substitutions and a single deletion. Interestingly, one of these substitutions is at position aa 407 within the RBD where a positively charged residue (Arg) is substituted by a hydrophobic residue (Ile). Other than obvious implications for virus-ACE2 binding, we investigated whether this substitution would also affect soluble ACE2 and S1",

This has implications from both the co-morbidity as well as interventional perspective. Our results suggest that S1-ACE2 complexes are stable and could potentially be systemically disseminated, more so in individuals with DM, HT and CV, resulting in higher co-morbidity and susceptibility to infection. Any vaccine generating neutralizing antibodies, for example, would need to disrupt these soluble complexes as well and conversely, if successful in doing so, would dramatically reduce susceptibility in vulnerable populations.",

            "text": "The second major thrust of our study was to understand how potential therapeutics, being actively considered for widespread prophylactic and therapeutic intervention would affect virus-receptor interaction. Considering that an earlier report for SARS-CoV had suggested the possibility of such modulation (Martin JV, et al., 2005) , we expanded our analysis to include active metabolites of these drugs. The drugs/metabolites evaluated were Azithromycin, Descladinose-azithromycin, 9a-N-desmethyl-azithromycin, Hydroxychloroquine, Desethyl chloroquine, Desethyl hydroxychloroquine, and bis desethyl hydroxychloroquine (BDCQ). We report for the first time that each of these compounds have the potential to allosterically modulate S1-ACE2 binding when studied using a protein-ligand approach. HCQ and its metabolites with the exception of BDCQ showed lower affinity and higher inhibitory constants compared to those of Azithromycin. Significantly, metabolites in general showed similar binding affinity compared to their respective parent compounds. In fact, in the case of Hydroxychloroquine, BDCQ showed almost 30-fold better binding to ACE2 and this affinity was similar to that observed for Azithromycin. The lack of sequence information both globally and especially from India (Forster P, et al., 2020; Yadav P, et al., 2020) has limited our ability to robustly examine true consensus sequences for our analysis. Also, our insights need to be experimentally validated in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results highlight a putative role of S1-sACE2 complexes in viral pathogenesis in susceptible populations. Further, we posit a direct role for ACE2 interacting drugs and other lead compounds (Goswami D, et al., 2020) in preventing infection, ameliorating viral carriage and eventually affecting transmission.",

When the RBD binding site was evaluated in INS1 and INS2 we observed that Arg 408 of INS1 interacts with Asp405 and Thr376 resulting in a salt bridge and hydrogen bond within the RBD respectively. Interestingly, both these interactions are lost post substitution of Arg with Ile in INS2 (Figure 3c). Protein-Protein docking ACE2 was docked with the RBD of INS1 and INS2 which includes the RBM (described in Methods). The top cluster generated by HADDOCK was considered to reliable based on available literature. Higher HADDOCK dock score was observed between ACE2 and INS1 compared to ACE2 and INS2. The buried surface area of INS1 was higher than INS2. Three salt bridges along with eleven hydrogen bonds were observed between complete ACE2 and INS1 (Figure 4a, b and",
