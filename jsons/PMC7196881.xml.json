As Tada (2015) describes, while traditional (i.e., premodern) religion had been losing its normative communality through post-WWII industrialization and individualization, Luckmann newly declared language \u201ca social a priori (ein gesellschaftliches Apriori)\u201d (Luckmann 1983, p. 1573). In his view, language mediates between human beings, between human beings and objective reality, and between human beings and their sociocultural history (Luckmann [1973] 1983, p. 79). Luckmann thus saw language as a lifeworldly collective foundation given to individuals, saying, \u201cthe human kind of community-building (Gemeinschaftsbildung) without language is inconceivable\u201d (Luckmann 1962, p. 514). By transmitting intersubjective knowledge, language joins individuals into a \u201chistorical community\u201d (see Luckmann [1973] 1983, p. 90). In this context, he names Durkheim:",

Durkheim himself remarks, \u201cThe system of concepts with which we think in everyday life is the one that the vocabulary of our mother tongue expresses; for every word translates a concept\u201d (Durkheim 1912, p. 619 = [1915] 1964, p. 433), and therefore \u201cIn the word, there is [\u2026] condensed a whole knowledge (science) to which I have not collaborated, that is, a knowledge more than personal; and it surpasses me to such an extent that I cannot even completely appropriate all its results for myself\u201d (Durkheim 1912, p. 621 = [1915] 1964, pp. 434\u2013435). As detailed below, language for Durkheim is a social fact\u2014a type of acting, thinking, and feeling external to an individual and vested with binding force (Durkheim [1895] 1956, pp. 4\u20135 = 1982, p. 51).",

In other words, Durkheim\u2019s community is that equated with French civil (and national) society. In fact, he himself described French society as a \u201ccommunion of minds (communion des esprits)\u201d (Durkheim [1898] 1987b, p. 272 = 1973b, p. 52), whose members were associated through respect for the abstract individual. Durkheim\u2019s view of language must also be grasped in this context: He attended to society-building (Gesellschaftsbildung, Vergesellschaftung; societization or sociation) by citizens who shared modern human ideals and spoke French, the \u201ccommon language of citizens for free communication\u201d (see R. Balibar 1991, p. 74) above the vernaculars of lifeworldly communities.",

In his opinion, beliefs (i.e., conceptual thoughts or ideals) are only active when they are shared (Durkheim 1912, p. 607 = [1915] 1964, p. 425). Society, he remarks, \u201ccan last only on the condition that there exist sufficient similarities between all its members, that is to say, on the condition that they all reproduce, in differing degree, the essential characteristics of the same ideal which is the collective ideal\u201d (Durkheim [1925] 2012, p. 97 = [1961]).

He even insisted that society rather than community is a living organism and morally superior; while pre-modern communities remain relatively self-sufficient segments and only form a mechanical solidarity, the division of labor in modern society leads to interdependent, organic solidarity among functionally specialized parts or individuals, and this becomes the source for respect of abstract human being (see Durkheim [1893] 1973a, p. 396 = [1933] 1960, p. 401; see also Tiryakian 1978, pp. 197\u2013199).

With French society in mind, Durkheim remarked, \u201cTo be attached to society is to be attached to the social ideal\u201d (Durkheim [1925] 2012, p. 93 = [1961]) and an \u201c[I]deal type which each society asks its members to realize [is] the keystone of the whole social system and gives it the unity\u201d (Durkheim [1906] 1951c, pp. 81\u201382 = 1965, p. 57).6 Durkheim deemed France a \u201ccommunity of ideas\u201d (Cladis 1998, p. 28).",

Rather, society (Gesellschaft) would usually come into existence through a cross-cultural linkage of communities (Gemeinschaften), which would respectively have their own vernacular and Volksgeist. Therefore, to presume the linguistic homogeneity of society to be a natural given is na\u00efve.

Durkheim\u2019s sociology of religion attracts much attention, but his sociology of education was much more theoretically important for him since religion is underpinned by education. To begin with, he perceived traditional religions to no longer function in rebuilding favorable solidarity among modern people (Durkheim 1897, pp. 430\u2013432, 440\u2013441 = [1951], 383). Of course, nor does education itself have such a function. It is a mere reflection of society because of its dependence on the moral condition of society (Durkheim 1897, pp. 427\u2013428 = [1951]). However, this implies that, insofar as society is morally healthy, education can reproduce it.

While Max Weber famously characterized the nature of the modern state as a monopoly on violence, Durkheim seemingly considered it, to borrow Ernst Gellner\u2019s ([1983] 2008, p. 33) words, to lie in the \u201cmonopoly of legitimate education.\u201d Durkheim utters, \u201cAs long as education is an essentially social function, the State cannot be disinterested in it.

Eventually, in 1833 during the anti-Catholic July Monarchy, the laicization of primary education was undertaken with the so-called Guizot Law, which declared that each municipal commune with over 500 population must have one public primary boy\u2019s school and each prefecture one normal boy\u2019s school (Tanigawa 2015, pp. 151\u2013152; Baub\u00e9rot [2000] 2008, chap. 2\u20133).

Thus, Durkheim regarded the state-controlled school as a kind of church of civil religion.

In Durkheim\u2019s view, state-controlled education incorporates moral individualism into French national identity, and thereby the French national society becomes a civil-social reality sui generis, which would impose sanctions upon behaviors that compromise sacred human ideals such as freedom and equality: \u201c[T]here is one [society] that enjoys a genuine primacy over all the others.

This difference would, along with Durkheim\u2019s theory, derive from the fact that children are neither well-learned nor well-socialized by language: Language brings a logical, reflexive, and self-controlled state to thought\u2014it pulls thought out of its natural state (Durkheim [1938] 2014, p. 394 = [1977] 2006, p. 344).

As suggested above, he justified the exclusive use of French at school, as if it were common sense, using the expression \u201cour language\u201d (notably in singular form, and not the plural \u201cour languages\u201d) and stating that (only) French is suitable for expressing the general ideals of the French Revolution:",

Durkheim, despite his language-relativist views, seems to have adopted the hierarchy of analytical quality among languages. This belief in the supremacy of French over other languages is already a kind of linguistic nationalism, but it is not limited to Durkheim. Combined with the loyalty to the State, such a belief was seen in the French liberal intelligentsia of those days, as Hughes points out, \u201c[T]he French intellectuals were not even remotely tempted to renounce their national allegiance. [\u2026] The French writer or scholar simply assumed that his country was the center of the civilized world, as its language was the most perfect vehicle for intellectual communication\u201d (Hughes 1958, p. 59). However, what is more noteworthy here is that the faith in the supremacy of French could be directed against not only foreign languages but also regional languages inside borders: patois are less clear than French, as Hamel, a primary school teacher in Alsace, may have believed. Interestingly, Durkheim remarked that two dead languages, Latin and ancient Greek, would be helpful for children to learn abstraction and analysis (Durkheim [1938] 2014, pp. 310\u2013317, 395\u2013396 = [1977] 2006, pp. 270\u2013277, 345). On this score, Durkheim acknowledged room for linguistic compromise with the church. In contrast, he totally ignored the possibility of using or teaching the living languages of France other than French in schools, although language confined to the private sphere would have little chance of survival.",

If I tried to escape from this necessity, my attempt would fail miserably\u201d (Durkheim [1895] 1956, p. 5 = 1982, p. 51, emphasis added). However, it is doubtful that such a monolingualism had been fully realized in France.

It is impossible to artificially resuscitate a particularist spirit which no longer has any foundation. (Durkheim 1897, p. 449 = [1951], emphasis added)\n",

To illustrate, the distinction between civic and ethnic nations, an ideal-typical classification of nations being jus soli or jus sanguinis, is useful. Relevant to the discussion here is that the civic nation is conventionally represented by France and the ethnic nation by Germany (Brubaker 1992). Durkheim\u2019s view of language also belongs to the former jus soli nation-view: A nation is a selectable, contractual community of citizens who, regardless of their ethno-communal elements, resonate with modern human ideals and speak the language of freedom that expresses those ideals. \u201cFrench nationality was,\u201d Eric Hobsbawm remarks, \u201cFrench citizenship: ethnicity, history, the language or patois spoken at home, were irrelevant to the definition of \u2018the nation\u2019\u201d (Hobsbawm 1992, p. 88). To be precise, French was the exception among languages spoken in the country. It was a symbol of the trans-communal citizenship of a revolutionary nation. In this sense, belonging to the French linguistic community was a choice, a social a posteriori that individual citizens could and should, in theory, acquire by will (and irrespective of their mother tongues.)

Since the Deixonne Law in 1951 and subsequent ethnic revival in the 1960s, leftists in France have advocated for regional languages (see also Takahashi 2013/14). However, in 1999, when the Constitutional Council (Conseil Constitutionel) judged that ratification of the Council of Europe\u2019s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages was unconstitutional, Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, then interior minister and a member of the socialist party, was also against ratification of the Charter, saying that the recognition of regional languages \u201cbalkanizes\u201d the one and indivisible Republic (The sentence cited in this paper\u2019s epigraph from Charlie Hebdo also appeared during the period in which this dispute over the Charter raged). Before these incidents, the sentence \u201cThe language of the Republic shall be French\u201d had been added to Article 2 of the Constitution under the socialist party\u2019s regime in 1992, just before the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by referendum. The original intention of this amendment was a cultural-differentialist resistance against English imperialism (or American neo-liberalism),19 but such a re-Francization contained a typical French-nationalist sense of crisis in which French is losing its former universality in international society and might become a local language in the global division of labor. One could say that such resistance to English, a global-social thing in the highest degree, is a form of regionalism.",

Such a sense is heightened more because they have share both French language and moral individualism.

Indeed, while seeking to realize the modern human ideals of the Revolution, he criticized the revolutionists for their social atomism that held all social things to come from individuals (Durkheim [1925] 2012, pp. 234\u2013237 = [1961] 1973, pp. 256\u2013259). By contrast, Durkheim conceived that civil society must be an organic whole or reality sui generis that is irreducible to individuals in advocating for their freedom.",

The haunting historical lesson is that the anti-Semitic fascist regime followed the Third Republic in which Durkheim had invested so much of his faith; furthermore, it made the first official modification to the basic policy of eradicating minority languages that had been pursued since the Revolution. Responding to regionalist insistence by right-wing nationalists in the wake of the conclusion of the Armistice of June 22, 1940 with Nazi Germany, the Vichy regime allowed the teaching of dialectal languages (langues dialectales) as an optional subject at primary school (Miyajima 1998, p. 176; see also Miura 2000, p. 119). This ironic phenomenon\u2014the official recognition of the linguistic right by the fascist regime\u2014must not be simplistically dismissed as resulting from obscurantism. Rather, it seems to be a dialectic (or viciously cyclical) product of civil nationalism and ethnic nationalism in France. An uncompromising belief in the nation, whether leftist or rightist, can always invert into the principle of exclusion and consequently produce a reaction by the excluded people.",
