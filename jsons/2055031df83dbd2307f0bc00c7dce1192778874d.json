The most important thing to do before the treatment is to take the patient's clothes off since it has been proved that by doing so the radiation exposure of the treating staff could be reduced by 85-90 % [11] . Usually, the skin serves as a very good barrier against radiation so the chance of internal damage from radiation is low.

When a bomb detonates, there is a very rapid transformation from a solid or liquid state to a gaseous state. The gas spreads outward in a radial fashion as a highpressure blast wave [16] at supersonic speed. The air condenses rapidly in the edge of the blast wave and creates a shock front. The wave itself and the air movement it propels (named blast wind) follow the shock front. In ideal conditions in the open air, the intensity of the wave should decline with time according to the timepressure curve (Friedlander curve), but nevertheless, there are some variables that might influence the energy scatter, such as a blast in a confined space. In a closed space, the wave is pushed off the walls and its intensity could be increased up to ninefold [22] .",

Research on American casualties from Iraq tried to isolate specific injuries that could be used as prognostic factors for early demise and demonstrated that the presence of two or more of the following variables could significantly raise the mortality rate -hypotension, 3 or more broken long bones, penetrating head injury, and other fatalities in the same traumatic event (20 % for a single variable and 86 % for two and more) [45] . Another study conducted in Israel on 798 terrorrelated casualties found a significant relation between the development of blast lung injury and penetrating head injuries, large burn area (over 10 % BSA), and skull fractures [46] . Age is another very important factor -elderly patients might have other diseases that are not related to the trauma, which might render their treatment more complicated in a terror-related event [47] . These prognostic factors could help the triage officer to allocate the casualties into the different groups more accurately though there is no replacement for clinical judgment and training.",

Actually, in the treatment of non-terror-related trauma patients, it is quite accustomed to do some over-triage since usually there are enough resources and personnel to treat severe injuries. Under-triage, however, is always dangerous [48] .

The neurovascular examination of an injured limb is of high importance as well, though sometimes it is not enough, especially in explosion scenarios. In a study conducted on improvised explosive device (IED) casualties, the researchers found that among 25 % of the patients with a normal physical examination, angiography demonstrated a significant vascular injury and 18 % of them required surgery for it [54] .",

The fear was that the surgery to fix the fractures might induce fat emboli, and the patients were operated on (if at all) only after long periods of traction, which in turn caused a lot of morbidity and long-term dysfunction of the limbs [57] . Towards the end of the 1960s, with the emergence of the AO organization, a conceptual change has been introduced so that every patient was operated on immediately and definitively upon arrival, according to the new principle of \"early total care.\" The leading slogan was now \"the patient is too sick not to be operated on.\" At first, this approach was only clinically based, but in the 1980s, prospective studies began to appear with strong evidence regarding its advantages. These studies demonstrated significantly lower rates of pulmonary complications such as ARDS, pneumonia, and fat emboli in patients whose femur fractures were treated with an intramedullary nail (IMN) on arrival [58] . Concurrent decline in ICU admission days and total admission days was observed.",

He demonstrated that in most cases, one could achieve closure and coverage of wounds within 5 days of the injury. Later studies on US wounded soldiers found increased rates of infections of upto threefold in wounded soldiers who were not treated with early proper irrigation and debridement [65] .",

Traditionally, these injuries were treated with simple dress-ings for a long period of time until the wound healed [66] . The tendency today is to actively try to achieve soft tissue coverage and closure of wounds earlier than before. Celikoz described his experience with early definitive treatment of open fractures within 1-3 weeks (average 9.3 days) in 215 severely injured limbs as a result of gunshot injuries, land mines, and IEDs. Most of his patients had two consecutive surgeries of irrigation and debridement within 3 days of injury and on the third operation had definitive treatment both for the soft tissue and the fracture [66] . Celikoz describes major success rates with free flaps procedures -91.3 % -but states that this was a very large referral trauma center with great experience and that the aggressiveness of the treatment was an inseparable part of the success. Similar approach was taken by Langworthy et al. who developed a treatment algorithm for mangled extremity injuries as a result of explosions -The Balboa Blast Treatment Protocol [67] . This protocol includes four stages of treatment: first, resuscitative stage of the patient and limb within 1-4 h of injury; second, preliminary stabilization of the fracture and limb, within 1-72 h; third, coverage and closure of soft tissue, within 3-7 days; and fourth, disability treatment, after 7 days (Fig. 14.4) .",

The results showed a significantly lower rate of infection with the use of the VAC system (8.4 % versus 20.6 % in concordance).

Coupland stated that the external fixator enables the treatment of the soft tissue injury while maintaining relative stability of the fracture, thus allowing it to heal with the creation of callus tissue and sometimes with no need for an internal fixation procedure later on [64] . This method is applied by the American Army in all campaigns in the recent years [71, 72] and was also extensively used by the Israeli Army in the treatment of the earthquake casualties in Haiti in 2010. The Israeli Army's Field Hospital Unit treated over a thousand patients in 10 days, out of which 73 external fixators were applied for open fractures and femoral fractures [73] . Even though a vast agreement exists regarding the use of external fixators in a terror-related mass-casualty event, there are reports of other fixation techniques in these settings as well. Weil described the experience of the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem in the treatment of long-bone fractures as a result of terroristic attacks and demonstrated promising results with the use of IMN on an immediate basis; however, in order to treat the patients in that manner, the surgical team has to be highly skilled and the hospital needs to have all the resources available at all times [33] .",

The decision whether to amputate the limb or try and save it is a complex and difficult decision which entails not only medical issues but also ethical and social ones. Throughout the years, there were many attempts to build a scoring system that will help with these decisions and maybe the most familiar is the Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) published by Helfet et al. in 1990 [75] . The scoring is given according to four clinical cri-teria: the extent of soft tissue injury, limb ischemia, hypotension state, and age; a scoring of 7 points and over was demonstrated to be predictive of an amputation. Although this system is easy to use and apply, it has many advocates, and eventually, the decision whether to save or amputate the limb should be a clinical one and has to be made on an individual basis. Other influencing elements have to be taken into account in the decision process, such as other injuries, the neurological status of the patient and the limb, and the vitality of the muscle tissues; plastic and vascular consultations are highly recommended [67] .",

Most of these casualties will have limb and other skeletal injuries and will need orthopedic involvement in their treatment. The orthopedic surgeon must recognize these injuries and their potential complications, mainly infections and the future loss of function, and must know to apply the principles of the DCO in their treatment. We also all need to bear in mind that the treatment of these patients does not end with the last suture of the surgery, since a very long and exhausting rehabilitation period will accompany them and their families for years to come.",
