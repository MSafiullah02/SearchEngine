They are marked as hidden travelers, who are detected later during 1-2 weeks period of lock down. We have investigated the impact of those travelers on selective 15 states, having large number cases. Among them 5 states have faced a noticeable effect on their data profile, although its overall effect in country level is quite negligible. Searching the Sigmoid trends of all 15 states, we have identified 3 categories depending upon latest data of new case with respect to the peak value of Sigmoid functions. Based on our optimistic predicted curves, ongoing lock down period might be enough for getting marginal values of new cases for KL, HR, JK, TN and AP but the reamining of 15 states might need a third phase of lock down or alternative preventive measures.",

This article is focused on India and its some selective states, having large number of covid19 cases. This kind of epidemiological study for India is started by few research groups.

In that context, our earlier work [3, 4] have attempted to identify the time zone, from where an exponential growth almost started in India as well as its different states. Considering the last slope parameter in logarithm scale, transformation of exponential to Sigmoid function [7] is sketched for the different states and they are compared with respect to existing number of Beds in Govt. hospitals. After those initial investigations, present work is attempted to zoom in the imported covid19 data of India [6] and its connection with Sigmoid nature of updated data (till 18th April). This attempt has tried to understand imported to local transmission through different possible redistribution of existing data.",

Here, we have noticed how this imported data is gradually transformed to zero during lock-down period. Then in Sec. (3), we have identified 5 states, which face a noticeable impact from this imported data. While in Sec. (4) , 10 more states, having ignorable impact of imported data, are discussed. In both sections (3) and (4) , the Sigmoid trend of data are analyzed and based on that pattern, we classified the 15 states into 3 gross categories.

However, there should be some traveler, whose symptoms reveal instantly (within \u223c 24 \u2212 48 hours) after reaching his/her own states. Separate these two type of imported cases (instantly and later detected cases) is a very challenging job as covid19 data collectors have to know the exact journey date of each imported cases. Interestingly, the separation become easy after 25 th March because of implementing lock-down. Analyzing the data roughly from 18 March (2 days before shutting down of airlines and rail transportation) to onwards, we will get instantly detected cases of imported group in the time-zone -t < 25 March. While later detected cases or HTs are located in the time-zone -t > 25 March. Now if we critically analyze and manipulate the data of HTs, then they might be shifted from lock down phase (\u2265 25th March) to before lock-down (< 25th March) phase. If we exclude them then we might get little flatten curves of total cases. In this context, we have considered 5 states -Tamil Nadu (TN), Kerala (KL), Andhra Pradesh (AP), Uttar Pradesh (UP), Karnatak (KA), which carry noticeable amount of HTs and we noticed a change in the time profile of total cases and new cases when we go from including to excluding of HTs in the data. In Fig. ( 3), total cases (upper) and new cases (lower) data with (black circles) and without (pink triangles) HTs for TN (left), KL (right) are plotted. To mark the lock down period, we have drawn two vertical red dotted lines at 25th March and 3rd May.

Until we don't see any visible reduction in future data, it is little hard to predict. So they are quite close to third category.

First, we sketch the pattern of imported data with days in new and total cases. Defining the ratio between imported to all covid19 cases, we have found its variation with time. Since Covid19 is an imported disease for all country (except China), so the ratio should be one in the beginning and later it will be reduced. For covid19 data of India, we find that from 30th January to 4th March the ratio remain one and after that, the ratio started to reduce, which implies that imported person have started to spread infection to others. During 4th March to 20/25th March the reduced value of ratio remain within 0.6 to 0.8 but after that period it face gradual reductions due to effect of lock down from 25th March to onwards. The imported cases, documented after 25th March, probably traveled before 20th March, which means that their covid19 symptom take time to reveal. For our convenience, we have called them as HTs (hidden travelers). We explored the impact of HTs on Sigmoid type pattern of total and new cases data. In general, the Sigmoid profile of total cases transform from rapid growth to flatten growth and saturates towards a maximum value N m . On the other hand, it's new case profile increase, then saturate to a peak value(s) and then decrease to marginal values. We have found that this maximum value N m in total case, and peak, marginal positions in new cases are increased because of the HTs. This enhancing factor will not work further after 8th April, from when the data of HTs is completely disappeared. This might be considered as a quantitative factor, reflecting a straight forward benefit of lock down. However it has been noticed in 5 states -TN, KL, AP, KA, UP.",

From 30th January to 8th April, total imported cases are 1,533 among which 595 were imported from abroad and 938 were from state to state transferred case. Interestingly this 938 numbers is identified within 25th March to 8th April. So one can guess that this state to state transfer crowed occurred within 18th to 20th March who were diagnosed later from 25th March to 8th April. From here we can roughly estimate 1,000 positive cases, transfered from other state if transportation will be reopened for two days. They will further continue their second generation spreading before detected as +ve case. So, from present study, we may visualize a future second wave growth, coming from re-birthing imported data through lock-down/transportation relaxation. Maintaining state to state transportation blocking might be appeared as very promising solution. For more critical solution, one can go through the same way of investigations for different zones of each states.",
