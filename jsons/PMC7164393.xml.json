            "text": "The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (coronavirus, CoV) family\ncirculates in many avian and mammalian species. Phylogenetically, CoVs are divided into 4\ngenera: alpha (group 1), beta (group 2), gamma (group 3) and delta (group 4). Three new\nhuman CoV have emerged in the past 20 years with severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV\n(SARS-CoV) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and now\nSARS-CoV-2 in 2019 (1-3). In fact, all human CoV are thought to have emerged\noriginally as zoonoses (4-6). The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (referred to as COVID-19,\nCoronavirus disease 2019) has caused over 500,000 infections and over 25,000 deaths in 199\ncountries. Like SARS- and MERS-CoV, the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 can\nprogress to acute lung injury (ALI), an end stage lung disease with limited treatment\noptions and very poor prognoses(3, 7, 8). This emergence paradigm is not limited to humans. A novel\ngroup 1 CoV called swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) recently emerged from bats\ncausing the loss of over 20,000 pigs in Guangdong Province, China (9). More alarmingly, many group 2 SARS-like and MERS-like\ncoronaviruses are circulating in bat reservoir species that can use human receptors and\nreplicate efficiently in primary human lung cells without adaptation(9-12). The presence of these \u201cpre-epidemic\u201d\nzoonotic strains foreshadow the emergence and epidemic potential of additional SARS-like and\nMERS-like viruses in the future. Given the diversity of CoV strains in zoonotic reservoirs\nand a penchant for emergence, broadly active antivirals are clearly needed for rapid\nresponse to new CoV outbreaks in humans and domesticated animals.",

Using a recombinant\nMERS-CoV expressing nanoluciferase (MERS-nLUC)(18), we measured virus replication in cultures exposed to a\ndose range of drug for 48hr. NHC was potently antiviral with an average half-maximum\neffective concentration (IC50) of 0.15 \u03bcM and no observed cytoxicity in\nsimilarly treated uninfected cultures across the dose range (50% cytotoxic concentration,\nCC50, >10 \u03bcM) (Fig. 1A). The\ntherapeutic index for NHC was >100. Using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV2\n(2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020), we performed antiviral assays in African green monkey kidney\n(Vero) cells and found NHC was potently antiviral with an IC50 of 0.3 \u03bcM\nand CC50 of >10 \u03bcM (Fig. 1B). We\nthen determined the antiviral activity of NHC against SARS-CoV-2 in the Calu-3 cells\nthrough the measurement of infectious virus production and viral genomes. We observed a\ndose-dependent reduction in virus titers (Fig. 1C)\nwith an IC50 of 0.08 \u03bcM. Viral genomic RNA was quantitated in clarified\nsupernatants by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Like the effect on\ninfectious titers, we found a dose-dependent reduction in viral genomic RNA and a similar\ncalculated IC50 of 0.09 \u03bcM. Collectively, these data demonstrate that\nNHC is potently antiviral against two genetically distinct emerging CoV.",

HAE model the\narchitecture and cellular complexity of the conducting airway and are readily infected by\nmultiple human and zoonotic CoV, including SARS- and MERS-CoV (19). We first assessed cytotoxicity of NHC in HAE\ntreated with an extended dose range for 48hr using quantitative PCR of cell death-related\ngene transcripts as our metric. NHC treatment did not appreciably alter gene expression\neven at doses up to 100 \u03bcM (fig. S1). We then sought to determine if NHC would\ninhibit clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2 replication in HAE. We observed a dose dependent\nreduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus production (Fig.\n2A). In MERS-CoV infected HAE, NHC substantially reduced virus production with\nmaximal titer reduction of > 5 logs at 10 \u03bcM (average IC50 = 0.024\n\u03bcM), which correlated with reduced genomic (ORF1) and subgenomic (ORFN) RNA in\npaired samples (Fig. 2B). We observed similar trends\nin titer reduction (> 3 log at 10 \u03bcM, average IC50 = 0.14 \u03bcM)\nand in copies of genomic and subgenomic RNA in SARS-CoV- infected HAE (Fig. 2C). Thus, NHC was potently antiviral against\nSARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in primary human epithelial cell cultures without\ncytotoxicity.",

            "text": "CoV are taxonomically divided into multiple genogroups (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) but\nhuman-infecting CoV are found in only the alpha and beta subgroups thus far (Fig. 3A). There is high sequence conservation in the\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) across CoV (Fig.\n3A). For example, the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 has 99.1% similarity and 96% amino acid\nidentity to that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 3A). To gain\ninsight into structural conservation of RdRp across the CoV family, we modeled the\nvariation reflected in the RdRp dendrogram in Fig. 3A\nonto the structure of the SARS-CoV RdRp (20) (Fig. 3B). The core\nof the RdRp molecule and main structural motifs that all RdRp harbor (Fig. 3B and fig. S2) are highly conserved among CoV including\nSARS-CoV-2. We previously reported that CoV resistance to another broad spectrum\nnucleoside analog, RDV, was mediated by RdRp residues F480L and V557L in a model\ncoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and in SARS-CoV, resulting in a 5-fold shift in\nIC50 (Fig. 3C)(21). Consequently, we tested whether RDV resistance\nmutations in MHV conferred cross-resistance to NHC. In fact, the two RDV resistance\nmutations, alone or together, conferred increased sensitivity to inhibition by NHC (Fig. 3D). As our previous studies have demonstrated a\nhigh genetic barrier to NHC for VEEV, influenza and CoV (14-16), the lack of cross-resistance further suggests that NHC\nand RDV may select for exclusive and mutually sensitizing resistance pathways.",

The more distantly related SARS-like beta 2b\nCoV, recombinant Bat-CoV HKU3, has a modified receptor binding domain to facilitate growth\nin cell culture (22). Lastly,\nBat-CoV HKU5 is a MERS-like beta 2c CoV (23). NHC diminished infectious virus production and the\nlevels of genomic/subgenomic viral RNA in HAE in a dose-dependent manner for all three\nBat-CoVs (Fig. 4). Therefore, the antiviral activity\nof NHC was not limited by natural amino acid variation in the RdRp, which among the group\n2b and group 2c CoV can vary by almost 20%. Moreover, these data suggest that if another\nSARS- or MERS-like virus were to spillover into humans in the future, they would likely be\nsusceptible to the antiviral activity of NHC.",

We sought to determine if NHC would increase the\nmutation frequency during MERS-CoV infection in human primary HAE. Using MERS-CoV-infected\nHAE treated with either vehicle or a dose range of NHC or RDV, we show that both drugs\nreduced virus titers in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\n5A). We then used a highly-sensitive high-fidelity deep sequencing approach\n(Primer ID NGS), which uses barcoded degenerate primers and Illumina indexed libraries to\ndetermine accurate mutation rates on viral RNA production (25). Using this approach, we analyzed a 538 bp region of\nviral genomic RNA in nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15). The error rates (#mutations/10,000\nbases) in vehicle- (0.01) or RDV- (0.01) treated cultures were very low. RDV is reported\nto act via chain termination of nascent viral RNA, and thus the low error rates in\nRDV-treated cultures are in line with the proposed MOA (26). In contrast, the error rate was significantly increased\nin NHC-treated MERS-CoV RNA in a dose-dependent manner (Two-way ANOVA with\nDunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test; 10-fold increase at 10 \u03bcM, P < 0.0001\nat 24 and 48 hpi; 5-fold increase at 1\u03bcM, P < 0.0001 at 24 hpi and P = 0.0015 at\n48 hpi) (Fig. 5C). The magnitude of the error rate in\nNHC-treated cultures correlated with virus titer reduction. At 48 hpi the respective error\nrate and virus titer was 0.015 and 3.96E+06 pfu/mL for vehicle treatment, 0.045 and\n2.86E+04 pfu/mL with 1 \u03bcM NHC; and 0.090 and 1.5E+02 pfu/mL 10 \u03bcM NHC. Thus,\nwith 1 \u03bcM NHC a 3-fold increase in error rate resulted in a 138-fold decrease in\nvirus titer, while with 10 \u03bcM NHC a 6-fold increase in error rate resulted in a\n26,000-fold decrease in virus titer.",

After initiating treatment, dosing for all\ngroups was performed every 12 hours for the duration of the study. Both prophylactic\ntreatment initiated 2 hours prior to infection and therapeutic treatment initiated 12\nhours after infection significantly (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison\ntest) prevented body weight loss following SARS-CoV infection on 2 dpi and thereafter (-2\nhours: P = 0.0002 to <0.0001; +12 hours: P = 0.0289 to <0.0001) as compared to\nvehicle treated animals (Fig. 6A). Treatment\ninitiated 24 hpi also significantly reduced body weight loss (3-5 dpi, P = 0.01 to\n<0.0001) although not to the same degree as the earlier treatment initiation groups.\nWhen initiated 48 hpi, body weight loss was only different from vehicle on 4 dpi (P =\n0.037, Fig. 6A). Therapeutic EIDD-2801 significantly\n(Kruskal-Wallis with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test) reduced lung hemorrhage\nwhen initiated up to 24 hours after infection (-2, +12, and +24 hours P < 0.0001)\nmirroring the body weight loss phenotypes (Fig. 6B).\nInterestingly, all EIDD-2801 treated mice had significantly (Kruskal-Wallis with\nDunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test) reduced viral loads in the lungs even in the\n+48 hours group (All P < 0.0001, Fig. 6C), which\nexperienced the least protection from body weight loss and lung hemorrhage.

Using Primer ID NGS,\nwe measured the mutation rates of both viral genomic RNA (non-structural protein 10,\nnsp10) and host interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) mRNA, a highly\nup-regulated innate immune-related gene after MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 7F). Primer ID NGS measures the mutational frequency in single RNA\nmolecules, each of which are represented by a single template consensus sequence (TCS)\n(25). Viral TCS were\nsignificantly reduced (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test, -2\nhours P <0.0001, +12 hours P = 0.0001, +24 hours P = 0.02) in a treatment initiation\ntime-dependent manner (Fig. 7G) similar to viral\ngenomic RNA measured by qRT-PCR. In contrast, the numbers of ISG15 TCS were similar (P =\n0.2 to 0.8) for all groups indicating that neither vehicle nor drug treatment\nsignificantly affected the levels of or mutated ISG15 mRNA transcripts (Fig. 7G). Similar to our TCS data in Fig. 6G, the total error rate in viral nsp10 was significantly increased\n(Two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test) in groups where treatment was\ninitiated prior to (-2 hours, median error rate = 10.5 errors/10,000 bases, P < 0.0001)\nand up to 24 hours post infection (12 hours, median error rate = 8.2 errors/10,000 bases,\nP < 0.0001 ; +24 hours, median error rate = 5.4 errors/10,000 bases, P = 0.0003) but\nthe error rates in ISG15 remained at baseline for all groups (Fig. 7H). In addition, nucleotide transitions observed in MERS-CoV\ngenomes in vitro, were also observed in vivo in groups where treatment was initiated prior\nto and up to 12 hours post infection (Two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple\ncomparison test, P = 0.0003 to < 0.0001) (Fig.\n7I). Importantly, these transitions were not observed in host ISG15 mRNA (Fig. 7I). Lastly, the EIDD-2801 dose-dependent\nmutagenesis of viral RNA correlated with an increase in codon change frequency, including\nstop codons, in mice where treatment was initiated 12 hours or before (Two-way ANOVA with\nTukey\u2019s multiple comparison test, vehicle median = 3.4; -2hr median = 22.8, P =\n0.0035; +12 hours median = 20.0, P = 0.0004, Fig.\n7J). Thus, approximately 20% of the mutations observed in the -2 hours and +12\nhours groups resulted in a codon change and alteration of the nsp10 protein sequence. When\nextrapolating our results from nsp10 to the entirety of the 30kb MERS-CoV genome,\nEIDD-2801 likely causes between 15 (+24 hours treatment) and 30 (-2 hours treatment)\nmutations per genome, 10-20% of which result in amino acid coding changes. Altogether, our\ndata demonstrates that EIDD-2801-driven mutagenesis correlates well with the reductions in\nviral load, strongly suggestive of an error catastrophe-driven mechanism of action under\ntherapeutic conditions.",

            "text": "Small molecule antivirals can exert their antiviral effect through multiple mechanisms\nincluding blocking viral entry, inhibiting a virally encoded enzyme, blocking virus particle\nformation, or targeting a host factor required for replication (32). Multiple direct acting antivirals are currently\nunder evaluation in randomized control trials to treat COVID-19 including\nhydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir(33-35). Here, we report the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of\nNHC and its orally bioavailable prodrug EIDD-2801, against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the\ncurrent pandemic strain SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelial cells. In addition to\nCoV, NHC is broadly active against multiple genetically distinct viruses including VEE,\ninfluenza A and B, Ebola, and Chikungunya viruses (13-16, 19, 21, 24, 36-38). Here, we show that prophylactic and therapeutic EIDD-2801\nsignificantly reduced lung viral loads and improved pulmonary function in mouse models of\nboth SARS- and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Although the improvement in both SARS- and MERS-CoV\noutcomes diminished with the delay of treatment initiation time, it is important to note\nthat the kinetics of disease in mice are compressed as compared to that in humans. Whereas\nSARS- and MERS-CoV lung titers peak on 1-2 dpi in mice concurrent with the onset of clinical\nsigns and notable damage to the lung epithelium, in humans this occurs 7-10 days after the\nonset of symptoms (19,\n28,\n39,\n40). Thus, in mice, the\nwindow within which to treat emerging CoV infection prior to peak replication is compressed\n(e.g., 24-48 hours). As with oseltamivir treatment for influenza which fails to provide a\nprotective effect if administered >5 days after the onset of symptoms, the window in\nwhich to treat COVID-19 patients prior to peak virus replication is likely during the first\nweek of symptoms when pharyngeal shedding is at its highest(41, 42). However, virus replication and shedding may continue for\nseveral weeks in the most severe COVID-19 patients(34). Thus, early intervention with an antiviral like EIDD-2801\nis likely to provide the most clinical benefit although there may opportunities in severe\npatients where the duration of virus replication may be extended. Our current study is\nclearly limited by the lack of in vivo efficacy testing with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, robust\nmouse models that recapitulate the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis observed in humans do not yet\nexist due to a noted virus spike glycoprotein and mouse ACE2 receptor incompatibility\ncomplicating the evaluation of medical countermeasures(43, 44). In addition, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 disease\nseverity increases with increasing age. Our studies are limited by the lack of drug efficacy\ntesting in CoV aged mouse models that recapitulate the age-related increase in pathogenesis\nobserved in humans(45). The data\nprovided in this manuscript suggest that EIDD-2801 should be quickly evaluated in primate\nmodels of human disease, using immediate models for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pathogenesis or\nnewly described cynomolgus and rhesus macaque models for SARS-CoV-2 (46-49).",

            "text": "For VEE and influenza, NHC/EIDD-2801 exerts its antiviral activity on the RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase leading to error catastrophe by inducing an error rate of replication that\nsurpasses the error threshold allowed to sustain a virus population (14, 15). This process occurs when NHC is incorporated during RNA\nsynthesis then subsequently misread thus increasing mutation rates. Therefore, for CoV, the\nNHC MOA would appear less likely to be affected by the RNA proofreading activity encoded by\nthe nsp14 exonuclease function that otherwise limits misincorperation (50). Here, we present data using Primer ID NGS to\nquantitate the frequency and identity of the mutational spectra in the MERS-CoV genome in\nboth drug-treated primary human airway cells and in mice at single genome resolution. As CoV\nare positive sense RNA viruses that replicate through a negative sense RNA intermediate, NHC\nincorporation as a C or a U can occur in both polarities of RNA. We found increased\nnucleotide transitions (A to G, G to A, C to U, U to C) consistent with those reported after\ninfluenza and VEE infections (14, 15). Under identical conditions, RDV did not alter the mutation\nrate in MERS-CoV genomic RNA, supporting its reported mechanism of action as a chain\nterminator of viral RNA synthesis (26). In primary human lung cell cultures and mice infected with\nMERS-CoV, the NHC mutation rates inversely correlated with a reduction in infectious virus.\nIn addition, we found a positive correlation between increased mutation rates and the\nfrequency of nonsynonymous mutations and the degree of therapeutic efficacy in mice. To\nexplore the potential off-target effect in host mRNA which may contribute to drug toxicity,\nwe also examined the impact of NHC treatment on ISG15 transcripts, a gene\nhighly induced following MERS-CoV infection. Although ISG15 transcripts are present in great\nabundance, an accumulation of mutations was not observed in ISG15 in this\nmodel even at 500 mg/kg dosing. These data also support previous studies using RNAseq to\ndemonstrate that the model coronavirus MHV displayed increased mutation frequencies\nfollowing NHC treatment in vitro (16). With regard to nucleic acid specificity, ribonucleotides are\nefficiently removed from eukaryotic cell DNA; therefore, treating a viral infection with a\nmutagenic ribonucleoside analog should show a selectivity for incorporation into the viral\ngenome and not be efficient at being incorporated into and inducing mutations into host cell\nDNA (51). All together, these data\nstrongly support the notion that EIDD-2801 and its active nucleoside analog NHC exert their\nantiviral effect through the induction of error catastrophe in the targeted virus. While our\ndata suggest that the MERS-CoV nsp14 proofreading activity appeared ineffective against NHC\nin vitro and EIDD-2801 in vivo, future studies should investigate the antiviral activity of\nNHC in the presence or absence of the nsp14 proofreading activity, as loss of this activity\nincreased the sensitivity of MHV and SARS-CoV replication to RDV treatment (50).",

Coupling cell lines and\nprimary HAE cell cultures, we evaluated the antiviral activity of NHC against the three\nmost recently emerged human CoV: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. For both SARS-CoV and\nMERS-CoV, the data presented for HAE studies are representative of those from 2-3 separate\nhuman donors. For SARS-CoV-2, the HAE were from a single human donor. We evaluated drug\ncytotoxicity in both Calu-3 2B4 and HAE cell cultures. Calu-3 and the SARS-CoV and\nMERS-CoV HAE studies were performed in biological triplicate. HAE studies with SARS-CoV-2\nand the SARS- and MERS-like bat CoV were performed with two wells per condition. Drug\neffects were measured relative to vehicle controls in vitro and comparisons in vivo were\nperformed to vehicle controls. We also aimed to determine the antiviral efficacy of\nEIDD-2801 in mouse models of CoV pathogenesis. These studies were intended to provide the\npreclinical data to justify nonhuman primate studies and human clinical trials.

            "text": "Primer ID NGS is designed to specifically identify and remove RT-PCR mutations, while\nfacilitating highly accurate sequence determination of single RNA molecules, because each\ncDNA is created with a barcoded degenerate primer (N10, 410 combinations) from\nwhich Illumina indexed libraries are made. We used a multiplexed Primer ID library prep\napproach and MiSeq sequencing to investigate the presence of mutations in the viral\ngenomes and murine mRNA. We designed cDNA primers targeting multiple regions on the viral\ngenome and murine mRNA, each with a block of random nucleotides (11 bp long) as the Primer\nID (25, 61) (table S2). Viral RNA\nwas extracted using QIAamp viral RNA kit. A pre-amplification titration of templates was\nperformed to estimate the amount of template to use. We used SuperScript III to make cDNA\nwith multiplexed cDNA primers based on the regions to be sequenced. We used 41R_PID11 for\nthe pilot sequencing and titration determination. For the MERS-CoV sequencing, we\nmultiplexed nsp10_PID11, nsp12_PID11 and nsp14_PID11 for the cDNA reaction; for the murine\nmRNA sequencing, we used mixed primers of nsp10_PID11, ifit3_PID11, isg15_PID11. After\nbead purification, we amplified the cDNA with a mixture of forward primers (based on the\ndescribed schemes) and a universal reverse primer, followed by another round of PCR to\nincorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and barcodes in the amplicons. After\ngel-purification and quantification, we pooled 24 libraries for MiSeq 300 base paired-end\nsequencing. The TCS pipeline version 1.38 (https://github.com/SwanstromLab/PID) was used to process the Primer ID\nsequencing data and construct template consensus sequences (TCSs) to represent each\nindividual input templates, and the sequences of each region in the pool was\nde-multiplexed. The RUBY package viral_seq version 1.0.6 (https://rubygems.org/gems/viral_seq) was used to calculate the mutation rate\nat each position. NCBI SRA Accession numbers for sequence data are as follows: PRJNA613261\n(Fig. 5) and PRJNA613454 (Fig. 7).",

For SARS-CoV, in\ncohorts of equivalent numbers of male and female 20-29 week old SPF C57BL/6J (Stock 000664\nJackson Labs) mice (n = 10/dose group), we administered vehicle (10% PEG, 2.5% Cremophor\nRH40 in water) or 50, 150 or 500 mg/kg EIDD-2801 by oral gavage 2 hours prior to\nintranasal infection with 1E+04 PFU mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strain MA15 in 50\u03bcl.\nMice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine prior to intranasal infection.\nVehicle or drug was administered every 12hr for the remainder of the study. Body weight\nand pulmonary function by whole body plethysmography were measured daily. On 5 dpi,\nanimals were sacrificed by isoflurane overdose, lungs were scored for lung hemorrhage, and\nthe inferior right lobe was frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for viral titration via plaque\nassay. Briefly, 500,000 Vero E6 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates. The following\nday, medium was removed and serial dilutions of clarified lung homogenate were added per\nplate (10\u22121 to 10\u22126 dilutions) and incubated at\n37\u00b0C for 1hr after which wells were overlaid with 1X DMEM, 5% Fetal Clone 2 serum,\n1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 0.8% agarose. Two days after, plaques were enumerated to\ngenerate a plaque/ml value. Lung hemorrhage is a gross pathological phenotype readily\nobserved by the naked eye driven by the degree of virus replication where the coloration\nof the lung changes from pink to dark red (62, 63). The large left lobe was placed in 10% buffered formalin\nand stored at 4\u00b0C for 1-3 weeks until histological sectioning and analysis. For\nMERS-CoV, the prophylactic dose escalation studies we performed similarly as done for\nSARS-CoV with our recently developed a mouse model for MERS-CoV, which has a humanized\nDPP4 receptor (hDPP4) (28). We\nperformed all in vivo studies with EIDD-2801 in equivalent numbers of 10-14 week old\nfemale and male C57BL/6J hDPP4 mice. Second, we intranasally infected mice with 5E+04 PFU\nmouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain M35C4 in 50\u03bcl. Third, to titer lungs by plaque assay,\nVero CCL81 cells were used and plaques were enumerated 3 dpi.",
