Infected cases can be handled appropriately in a remote location with well-connected tele-devices. It handles all cases smartly to provide ultimately strengthened service to the patient and healthcare. IoT seems to be an excellent way to screen the infected patient. In healthcare, this technology is helpful to maintain quality supervision with real-time information. By using a statistical-based method, IoT gets helpful to predict an upcoming situation of this disease. With proper implementation of this technology, researcher, doctors, government, academicians can create a better environment to fight with this disease.",
