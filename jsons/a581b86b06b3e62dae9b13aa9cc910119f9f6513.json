Not only must this dynamic state allow the retention of unique resident proteins, but there must also be a mechanism to preserve the total mem-brane content and surface area of each organelle. These problems are particularly significant for the ER, for which bulk flow measurements by Rothman and colleagues suggest that half the lipids are removed every 10 min without a comparable rate of de novo synthesis (Wieland et al., 1987) . Two possibilities have been suggested for how lipids are returned to the ER: from a post-ER compartment (most likely the cis Golgi) by vesicular recycling (Rothman, 1981; Farquhar, 1985) , or by the cytosolic transfer of nonvesicular lipid from Golgi to ER (Wieland et al., 1987) . Vesicular recycling would have important implications for the mechanism(s) for retention of ER proteins (Warren, 1987) . Resident ER proteins might not be merely anchored to the ER and retained in the face of an enormous flow of membrane into and out of the ER, as a nonvesicular lipid recycling model would predict. Instead, selective retrieval of retained proteins from the cis Golgi back to the ER might occur, as suggested by one recent study by Pelham (1988) .",

In this study we demonstrate that, in addition to preventing proteins from leaving the ER, treatment of cells with BFA has a profound effect on the structure of the cislmedial Golgi. Within minutes of BFA treatment, cislmedial Golgi components redistribute to and become part of the ER. Subsequent to this redistribution, processing of the carbohydrate chains of ER-retained glycoproteins by cislmedial Golgi enzymes is observed. A trans Golgi marker, in contrast, does not show redistribution to the ER during BFA treatment. We also observe no carbohydrate processing of ER-retained proteins that could be attributed to the trans Golgi. The effect of BFA is rapidly reversed upon removal of the drug. Minutes after the removal of BFA, Golgi proteins are rapidly transported from the ER into a newly reforming Golgi apparatus while ER-resident proteins with which they had been mixed remain in the ER. In addition, exportable proteins recover their ability to be transported out of the ER, through the Golgi apparatus, and onto more distal target organelles. These results can most simply be explained by a model in which BFA interferes with a dynamic membrane-recycling pathway between the ER and the cislmedial Golgi.",

This receptor is a multimeric protein complex composed of at least seven transmembrane chains. The a and p chains form a disulfide-linked heterodimer that functions in antigen recognition. They are noncovalently associated with five other chains: y, 6, E, and the homodimer 52 (Samelson et al., 1985) . Four of the TCR subunits (a, f3, 6, and y) contain N-linked carbohydrate chains. Newly synthe- sized TCR subunits assemble rapidly into pentameric (afir&) and heptameric (a&&&) complexes in the ER and are then transported through the Golgi apparatus either to lysosomes (i.e., pentamers) or the cell surface (i.e., heptamers) (Minami et al., 1987; Sussman et al., 1988) . While BFA has no effect on the assembly of TCR subunits into multimeric complexes (Lippincott-Schwartz, unpublished data), the drug has a dramatic effect on the ultimate fate and subcellular distribution of these complexes, as described below.",

            "text": "Retention of TCR Chains in the ER of BFRTreated T Cells Biochemical data from several research groups have suggested that BFA, a lipophilic compound with the structure of a heterocyclic lactone (Harri et al., 1963) , inhibits transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi system (Misumi et al., 1986; Takatsuki and Tamura, 1985; Odaet al., 1987) . To identify the site of blockade by BFA on intracellular transport of TCR chains in T cells, we used a morphological approach. Murine T cell hybridoma cells (284) were treated with or without BFA (10 pglml) (Sandoz Co., Switzerland) for various time periods and the resulting intracellular distribution of TCR chains was then examined by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. As shown by immunofluorescence ( Figure 1 , upper left), TCRs in control 284 cells detected with an anti-& antibody were distributed primarily in large, phase-dense vesicles identified as lysosomes by electron microscopy (see below). Very faint staining of the plasma membrane was also observed. Double labeling of the same cells with antibodies to ER-resident proteins (Figure 1 , upper right) showed virtually no coincidence between the two markers. These results on the subcellular distribution of TCR E chains are consistent with previous studies from our laboratory in which the majority of TCR chains were observed to assemble into partial pentameric complexes (i.e., aP@) that were rapidly transported out of the ER, through the Golgi complex, and into lysosomes where they were degraded. Only the small subset of TCR complexes that were assembled into complete heptameric complexes were targeted to the cell surface (Minami et al., 1987; Sussman et al., 1988) .",

Three hours after the addition of the antibiotic, immunofluorescence staining of lysosomes by anti-e antibody was no longer detectable ( Figure 1 , lower left). Instead, a fine reticular staining pattern along the nuclear membrane and throughout the cytoplasm was observed. Co-staining with antibodies to ER-resident proteins ( Figure 1 , lower right) revealed almost complete coincidence between the two labeling patterns. The reticular staining pattern by anti-a antibodies was greatly reduced when the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was included in the medium (not shown). These results suggested that BFA treatment caused newly synthesized E-containing TCRs to be retained in the ER. Loss of staining by anti-c antibodies from lysosomal structures during BFA treatment presumably was due to lysosomal degradation of the E chains since BFA reportedly has no inhibitory effect on lysosomal degradation (Misumi et al., 1986) .",

Indeed, examination of the effect of neuraminidase on the electrophoretic mobility of a in BFA-treated cells ( Figure 38 ) revealed that 1.5 hr after the biosynthetic pulse, these chains had not been modified with sialic acid, which requires transport to the frans Golgi compartment (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) (B) 284 cells were treated with or without BFA for 30 min, pulse-labeled for 10 min, and then chased in complete medium for 1.5 hr at 3pC. The chased cells were detergent solubilized, immunoprecipitated with anti-a antibodies, boiled for 5 min in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.1) containing 50 mM EDTA and 1% NP-40, and then incubated for 1 hr at 3pC in the presence (+) or absence (-) of 5 mU of neuraminidase (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA). Samples were analyzed by NEPHGUSDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Cleavage by neuraminidase of sialic acid residues on the mature a oligosaccharide chains of control cells resulted in a shift in migration of these chains from an acidic to basic pH. No comparable shift in migration of the chains from BFA-treated cells was observed, indicating that these chains were not modified with sialic acid.

Conversion from high-mannose to complex oligosaccharides occurs in the medial Golgi through the sequential activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and mannosidase II (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) . As shown in Figure 3A (bottom), newly synthesized TCR a chains began to show endo H resistance within 30 min of biosynthesis in BFA-treated cells. By 4 hr of chase, all of the a oligosaccharide chains in the BFA-treated cells had become completely resistant to endo H, just as in the control cells. Note that the a chain is progressively lost in both control and BFA-treated cells. In the former the a chains are being transported to and degraded in lysosomes (Lip-pincott-Schwartz et al., 1988) . In the latter case the a chains are subjected to ER degradation, which BFA does not inhibit (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., unpublished data). They chain of the TCR, as well, which also contains N-linked carbohydrate residues, showed evidence of processing by cislmedial Golgi enzymes in the BFA-treated cells. Roughly 50% of they chain carbohydrates became endo H resistant after 4 hr of chase (see below).",

If this process were very fast, TCRs would accumulate only in the ER, consistent with our morphological observations of BFA-treated 284 cells. To investigate this possibility, we turned to two T cell lines in which the TCR chains are not transported into the Golgi system. The 284 variant A2 synthesizes all of the TCR chains except 6 (Bonifacino et al., unpublished data) , and the murine T cell tumor line BW5147 fails to synthesize 8 and < chains . In the absence of one or more of the subunits, all other TCR subunits in these cells fail to negotiate ER-to-Golgi transport. This is presumably due to their inability to oligomerize properly. TCR glycoproteins in these cells never become endo H resistant, and by morphological criteria reside only in the ER (see below). Since TCRs in these cells are normally never transported to the Golgi, acquisition of endo H resistance during BFA treatment would not be predicted under the hypothesis of efficient movement to the Golgi with rapid retrieval to the ER.",

ERp99 is a glycoprotein of M, = 99,000 uniquely found and retained within the ER. Its characterization by Green and colleagues demonstrates that it remains in the ER at all times after its synthesis, with no Golgi processing of its carbohydrate chains (Lewis et al., 1985) . The predominant form of its N-linked carbohydrate is ManaGlcNAcp. 264 cells were pulse-labeled with [%]methionine for 10 min and then chased for 2 hr in the presence or absence of 10 Kg/ml BFA. After immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antibody, the precipitates were either mock-treated or digested with endo H before being subjected to SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In control cells the protein was identically sensitive to endo H at the end of the pulse and after the 2 hr chase. In BFAtreated cells ERp99 was sensitive to endo H at the end of the pulse but showed no shift in M, in response to endo H after the chase ( Figure 5C ). This demonstrated that BFA can cause processing of resident ER proteins by Golgi enzymes. Together, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that BFA acts solely by blocking transport of proteins from the medial to the Vans Golgi, since proteins retained in the ER, as well as exportable proteins, become modified by Golgi enzymes in the presence of this drug.",

            "text": "An alternative explanation for BFA's effects would be that, by inhibiting all protein transport out of the ER, it allows newly synthesized Golgi enzymes like mannosidase II to accumulate in the ER. This could explain how ERresident proteins become modified by otherwise Golgispecific enzymes in the presence of BFA. To test this hypothesis we looked at the effect of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, on the extent of carbohydrate processing of TCR chains in BFA-treated cells. If acquisition of endo H resistance by TCR glycoproteins in BFA-treated cells were due solely to the activity of newly synthesized mannosidase II, which has become trapped in the ER by BFA, then blocking protein synthesis prior to BFA treatment should prevent this by allowing newly synthesized proteins (like mannosidase II) to clear from the ER. Figure 6 shows the results from an experiment designed to test this possibility. Carbohydrate processing in BW5147 cells of the TCR y chain (a glycoprotein retained in the ER in these cells) was studied. BW5147 cells were metabolically pulse-labeled for 10 min and then incubated for 3.5 hr at 37% in complete medium alone, for 3.5 hr in medium containing BFA, or for 1.5 hr in medium containing cycloheximide followed by 2 hr in medium containing BFA plus cycloheximide. y Chain glycoproteins were then immunoprecipitated at various times of chase and treated with or without endo H. As shown in Figure 6 , cycloheximide did not prevent the processing of the y oligosaccharide chains to endo H-resistant forms in cells treated with BFA, even though lower quantities of newly synthesized mannosidase II should occur in the ER of these cells compared with control cells; in the latter, y oligosaccharide chains remain endo H sensitive. Cycloheximide did slow the kinetics of y processing 2-fold. Slowing of carbohydrate processing after prolonged treatment with this drug is seen in control cells in the absence of BFA (unpublished observations). Thus, newly synthesized mannosidase II for 10 min and then incubated for 35 hr at 3pC in complete medium alone (control), for 3.5 hr in complete medium containing BFA (10 pg/ml) (BFA), or for 1.5 hr in complete medium containing cycloheximide (10 pg/ml; Sigma) and then 2 hr in medium containing BFA plus cycloheximide (BFA + CHX). Treatment of cells with 10 &ml cycloheximide resulted in more than 95% inhibition of protein synthesis. The indicated time points for chase were started 1.5 hr after the end of the pulse. At these times the cells were detergent solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-y antibodies. lmmunoprecipitates were then treated with (+) or without (-) endo H before analysis by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. M, values (~10~~) are indicated at left. zymes themselves redistribute from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. To test for this possibility, we examined the morphological distribution of the cislmedial Golgi marker mannosidase II (Dunphy and Rothman, 1983; Farquhar, 1985; Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) , using antibodies to this enzyme in cells treated with or without BFA. As shown in Figure 7 (upper left), immunofluorescence staining for mannosidase II in permeabilized, normal rat kidney(NRK) cells revealed intense labeling of large, perinuclear structures characteristic of the Golgi apparatus. After 30 min of treatment with BFA, however, the distribution of mannosidase II had changed dramatically. The entire population of the Golgi enzyme had dispersed into a fine, punctate reticulum distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 7 , lower left). lmmunoperoxidase electron microscopy was performed to identify at the ultrastructural level the intracellular compartment(s) into which mannosidase II had redistributed during the BFA treatement. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were used for this purpose since staining by mannosidase II antibodies was greater in these cells than in other cells tested. However, the pattern of staining and redistribution was essentially identical in T cells (see below), fibroblasts, and RBL cells. As shown in Figure 8A , the HRP reaction product in control RBL cells was localized almost entirely to cis and medial Golgi cisternae. After BFA treatment ( Figure 88 ) virtually no HRP-positive Golgi cisternae could be detected in these cells. Instead, HRP staining was localized within the nuclear membrane, along ribosome-studded ER cisternae, and within vesicular and reticular elements of the ER. No labeling of lysosomes, mitochondria, multivesicular bodies, or the plasma membrane was observed in the BFA-treated cells. When cells were pretreated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis, the same morphological redistribution of mannosidase II was observed. These results indicate that, in the presence of BFA, mannosidase II is no longer localized in Golgi cisternae but has redistributed dramatically to the ER.",

WGA binds to clustered terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid residues as well as N-acetyiglucosaminecontaining oligosaccharide chains on proteins (Tartakoff and Vassaiii, 1993) .

Plasma membrane staining by fluorescent WGA was blocked by preincubation of the intact cells with unlabeled WGA. Upon BFA treatment little or no change in the staining pattern for WGA occurred, in contrast to that for mannosidase II. Morphologic studies using a monoclonai antibody directed against a resident integral membrane protein of the frans Goigi (Yuan et al., 1997) confirmed the WGA results and demonstrated that the tram Goigi does not redistribute with the cislmedial Golgi in response to BFA (data not shown). These results suggested that BFA exerts a profound effect on the structure of the Goigi apparatus, effectively causing a spatial segregation of cislmedial components (which redistribute to the ER) from the tram Golgi (which shows no localization to the ER).",

We used 284 ceils and the tumor line BW5147 for this purpose, since in the former ceil type TCR complexes are normally rapidly transported out of the ER and into the Golgi apparatus, while in the latter these complexes normally fail to leave the ER. In these experiments cycloheximide was used to block new protein synthesis. Thus, the immu-2B4 Cells , treated with BFA for 4 hr and then reincubated in fresh medium containing 10 nglml cycloheximide for 1.5 hr (recovery), or left untreated (control). The cells were then fixed, permeabilized with saponin, and double labeled with anti-s antibodies plus antibodies against ER proteins, or with anti-s antibodies plus antibodies against mannosidase II. After washing to remove unbound IgG, cells were incubated with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-hamster IgG to label the specifically bound E antibodies and with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG to label specifically bound ER-directed or anti-mannosidase II antibodies. After a final wash the cells were prepared for microscopy. Bar = 10 urn. nofluorescence changes after removal of BFA reflected true redistribution of TCR proteins. lmmunofluorescence staining of the TCR E chain in 284 cells (Figure 10 , left) revealed that these chains resided in the ER during BFA treatment, but once BFA was removed the chains redistributed throughout the secretory pathway to a steady state indistinguishable from the distribution in control cells. In both the recovered and control 284 cells, TCR E chains were localized predominantly in large vesicles corresponding to lysosomes and Golgi, in contrast to the fine reticular-vesicular network in which they were found during BFA treatment. Double labeling of the cells with antibodies to mannosidase II revealed the same redistribution of the Golgi enzyme to the ER upon BFA treatment as was observed in NRK and RBL cells. Likewise, removal of BFA resulted in transport of mannosidase II out of the ER into Golgi cisternae. Double labeling of the recovered cells with antibodies against the TCR E chain and ER-resident proteins demonstrated that ER-resident proteins with which TCR E chains and mannosidase II had mixed during BFA treatment remained in the ER. Thus, removal of BFA resulted in the rapid and efficient sorting of membrane components from the ER. lmmunofluorescence staining of TCR E chains in E3W 5147 cells (Figure 10 , right) revealed essentially no change in the distribution of TCR chains before, during, or after BFA treatment. At all times staining of the TCR E chains had a reticular-network pattern characteristic of the ER. Double labeling of these cells with antibodies to ER-resident proteins (bottom right two panels) confirmed the localization of E to the ER. The BFA-induced redistribution of mannosidase II and its recovery upon removal of the drug were identical in BW5147 and 284 cells. Altogether, these results suggest that BFA has no permanent effect on the mechanisms for intracellular trafficking of proteins in cells, since sorting of resident ER proteins (i.e., E chains in BW5147 cells) from exportable proteins (i.e., E chains in 2B4 cells) is restored upon removal of this drug.",

Both immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that BFA treatment of cells results in the accumulation of TCR chains in the ER, suggesting that BFA blocks protein transport out of the ER. In contrast, biochemical analysis of the carbohydrate side chains of the a and y TCR subunits in BFA-treated cells indicated they are processed in a manner consistent with movement into the medial Golgi. In particular, both of these subunits became resistant to cleavage by the enzyme endo H. This normally occurs only after glycoproteins have moved out of the ER and into the medial Golgi where the Golgispecific enzymes mannosidase II and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I convert the oligosaccharide side chains to an endo H-resistant, complex form. The ability of swainsonine, a specific inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase II, to block the acquisition of endo H resistance in the BFAtreated cells supported the conclusion that we were obsewing processing by Golgi enzymes.",

Our results strongly favored the third hypothesis-that Golgi enzymes themselves redistribute from the Golgi apparatus to the ER during BFA treatment.

The consequences of removing BFA from cells demonstrate graphically the rapid and efficient sorting of membrane components from the ER. Golgi proteins are rapidly removed from the ER into the newly reformed Golgi cisternae. ER-resident proteins with which they had been mixed remain in the ER. Likewise, TCR complexes rapidly recover their ability to be transported out of the ER, through the Golgi, and onto more distal target organelles.

Previous studies with BFA demonstrated that it primarily interferes with protein secretion; it has no noticeable effects on endocytosis, tysosomal degradation, or protein synthesis (Misumi et al., 1986) . We feel that BFA is acting by interfering with a normal recycling pathway between the Golgi and the ER. We can picture two ways in which this could explain our observations. First, the cis Golgi may be constantly recycling back to the ER and then efficiently sorted out of the ER and returned to the Golgi. If BFA blocked the latter step, the Golgi would simply continue to recycle to the ER but remain there. Second, lipidrich vesicles may be constantly recycling from the Gotgi to the ER without resident Golgi proteins. This would require a specific retention mechanism for keeping proteins within the Golgi stack while allowing lipid to return to the ER. If BFAabrogated the Golgi retention mechanism, then the Golgi proteins could recycle with the lipid. In effect, the Golgi would drain back to the ER, utilizing an underlying vesicular recycling pathway. The failure, then, of proteins to leave the ER would be a consequence of the absence of a target organ&e (i.e., the cis Golgi) for any vesicles leaving the ER. Rather, the ER itself (since, in the presence of BFA, it contains all of the components of the cis Golgi) would be the target for such vesicles.",

The constant redistribution of lipid through such an interlocking recycling system would allow the tremendous lipid flow out of the ER to be returned via a vesicular transport mechanism. This model would have a number of further implications. Based on previous studies, the rate of membrane flow through this recycling system would have to be rapid. Wieland et al. (1987) have measured the rate of membrane bulk flow out of the ER, estimating that the equivalent of at least half of the surface area of the ER is transported to the Golgi every 10 min. Assuming retrieval of this massive quantity of lipid occurs by recycling from the Golgi apparatus, these authors estimate that the average lipid in the Golgi would have a lifetime of about 1 to 2 min before it is recycled back to the ER. Our results demonstrating rapid kinetics for both movement of Golgi proteins into the ER in cells treated with BFA and their return to the Golgi upon removal of the drug are consistent with these estimates.",

It also appears to be the site of budding of coronaviruses (Tooze et al., 1988) . Perhaps the recycling from the Golgi occurs into this intermediate compartment in which ER and Golgi proteins might mix and be sorted. Such a compartment would be analogous to the endosome. If it proves to be truly analogous to the endosome, however, it is likely to be a complex organelle, both functionally and structurally.",

            "text": "Labeling, Immunopreclpltatlon, and Electrophoresls Cells were metabolically labeled with [35Sjmethionine as follows: Approximately 2 x 10' cells per time point were preincubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C in methionine-free RPM 1646 medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were labeled for IO min at 1 x 10' cells per ml with 0.25 mCi/ml [35Sjmethionine ICN, Irvine, CA) . Following the labeling period the cells were resuspended in complete culture medium. At appropriate time intervals the chase was terminated by placing the cells on ice. Solubilization and immunoprecipitation using antibody adsorbed to protein A-agarose (Bethesda Research Laboratories) were performed as previously described (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1966) . Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on one-or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (13%) using the buffer systems of Laemmli as described in Samelson et al. (1965) . Two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH-gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE)/SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions as described in Samelson et al. (1965) .lmmunofluorescence Microscopy Cells were either grown on 12 mm round coverslips or attached to concanavalin A-coated coverslips as described below in \"Other Procedures:' After appropriate treatments the cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 74) for 10 min at 25'C. The cells were next permeabilized with 0.15% saponin in PBS, 0.1% BSA, for 15 min and then incubated in antibody-containing medium. The cells were then washed in PBS, 0.1% BSA, incubated with fluorescently labeled second antibody, and washed again. Antibody incubations were for 1.5 hr at 25\u00b0C. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology) and viewed with a Zeiss ICM405 inverted microscope equipped with barrier filters to prevent crossover of fluorescein and rhodamine fluorescence.",

After washing to remove unbound IgG, the cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-hamster or goat anti-rabbit IgG, incubated with diaminobenzidine hydrochloride, HsOs, and prepared for electron microscopy, all as described in Yuan et al. (1967) .Other Procedures Digestion with endo H (Genzyme, Boston, MA) was performed by incubating the immunoprecipitates for 16 hr at 3pC with 5 mU of endo H in 50 pl of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.1) containing 0.1% Briton X-100, 0.03% SDS, and 20 mM EDTA.To attach suspended cells (including 284 and BW5147 cells) to coverslips for immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were washed twice at 4OC in HEBs buffer (containing 20 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCI, 0.5 mM KCI, 3 mM dextrose [pH 7.11). pipetted in a small volume of HEBs buffer (in the presence or absence of BFA) onto concanavalin A-coated glass coverslips, and incubated at 3pC for 15 min. The coverslips were then quickly washed twice in HEBs buffer, and the attached monolayer of cells was subsequently fixed in 2% formaldehyde. Coated coverslips were prepared by immersing the coverslips in a freshly prepared solution of concanavalin A (Sigma, grade IV) (5 mg/ml) and water soluble carbodiimide (Calbiochem) (30 mg/ml) in 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0) for 1 hr at 25%. The coverslips were then rinsed three times in HEBs buffer and stored in this buffer (up to 2 weeks) at 4OC before use. Tartakoff, A., and Vassalli, P (1983) .
