Sars-cov-2 could be recovered by real-time (RT) PCR from nasal and throat swabs, sputum and feces of symptomatic patients including neonates but not from vaginal swabs, amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, neonatal blood or breast milk. Viremia was present in 1% of symptomatic adults. We identified 12 articles published between February 10 th and April 4 th 2020 reporting on 68 deliveries and 71 neonates with maternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy. Perinatal exposure, including mode of delivery and time interval from delivery to the diagnosis of neonatal infection are crucial in differentiating congenital from perinatal infection. Neonatal infection is usually asymptomatic. Neonatal infection was diagnosed within 48 hours of life in 4 cases. Detection rates of realtime PCR and the interpretation of IgM and IgG antibodies levels in cord and neonatal blood are discussed in relation with the immaturity of the fetal and neonatal immune system.",

Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor 1 . RNA expression profile of ACE2 in the trophoblast appears very low at between 6 and 14 weeks', as assessed by combined single-cell transcriptome profiles from the early maternal-fetal interface 5 .

The overall picture resembles that of passive transfer of maternal antibodies, though IgM is known to not cross the placenta and could reflect fetal production following intrauterine infection.

            "text": "reported infected neonates whom symptoms appeared within 2-4 days of life were born by cesarean section while the few newborns after vaginal delivery were not suspected of being infected. Although the numbers are small, this does support the possibility of per-partum infection, especially since the virus could not be isolated from vaginal swabs. More definitive evidence is therefore needed before early findings based upon incomplete observations and serological studies of uncertain reliability can be used for counselling pregnant women on the risk of congenital infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, we should remain aware of another possible pathway towards covid-19 related perinatal morbidity. Prolonged and severe fetal hypoxia could potentially occur in pregnancies presenting in critically hypoxemic conditions and requiring intensive and prolonged resuscitation and ventilation. It is probably too early to have such cases reported in the literature since ischemic-hypoxic lesions could take up to 6-8 weeks' to develop and be amenable to prenatal or postnatal imaging. Although no recommendations have been issued to date, it would seem advisable to follow those cases up with fetal and neonatal serial imaging if and when the maternal condition allows this.
