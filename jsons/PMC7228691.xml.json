Rapid inflation of the balloon at the beginning of diastole generates proximal and distal blood displacement, which is proportional to the volume of the balloon. Diastolic blood pressure augmentation increases the intrinsic windkessel effect leading to storage of extra potential energy in the aorta and conversion to kinetic energy following the elastic recoil of the vessel [3]. This event has the potential to increase coronary blood flow. Rapid deflation of the balloon in early systole leads to afterload reduction or, to be more precise, to reduction of impedance to ventricular ejection and cardiac work [4],[5]. This is in accordance with a previous analytical model [5].",

The study was designed as a multicentre, randomised, open-label trial. Between 2009 and 2012, 600 patients with cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction and requiring early revascularisation were randomised to IABP versus control. Long-term follow-up (6.2 years) showed no difference in mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, repeat revascularisation or hospital readmission for cardiac reasons between the two groups. Nevertheless, the use of IABP in cardiogenic shock remains the subject of significant debate and controversy.",

When the IABP is \u201cOFF\u201d (SW1=ON and SW2=OFF), the aortic (thoracic) tract is modelled using resistance RAT (RTT), compliance CAT (CTT) and inertance LAT (LTT). The first abdominal tract behavior is reproduced by RLC elements (RABT1, LABT1 and CABT1) when the IABP is disabled. The second abdominal tract is modelled by RABT2, LABT2, CABT2 and by variable systemic arterial resistance (Ras). The switches SW1 and SW2 are set to OFF (ON) and ON (OFF) respectively, when the device is (not) working. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances (CIABP1, CIABP2 andCIABP3) connected to PIABP generator and resistances (RIABP1, RIABP2 and RIABP3). PIABP generator reproduces the balloon pressure and the possibility to change the IABP temporization.

Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases from 23% to 18% when IABP is activated. The assistance induces about 10% reduction in EDV (when the ratio is 1:1) and about 5% reduction in the mean value of EDV (calculated on eight cardiac cycles) when the IABP ratio is set to 1:8. There is about 13% (7%) decrease in ESV when IABP is set to 1:1 (1:8). A 27% (13%) reduction in end diastolic blood pressure (EDP) is observed during IABP activation with 1:1 (1:8) ratio. The simulation results show a reduction in the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes with concomitant decrease in the left atrial filling and in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) leading to reduced right ventricular afterload. These findings are completely in accordance with literature data. Besides, the PCWP reduction during the simulation can be up to 10%.",

Although a certain degree of uncertainty remains, the ability to model and simulate in advance critical clinical conditions with a view to treatment optimization and outcome prediction may be an option to consider on a more routine basis. The severe respiratory impairment caused by COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation and ECMO support has generated severe strain on intensive care units capacity and hospital resources. Redeployment of medical and nursing staff in different roles has required crash training for those not accustomed to a certain type of work. The ability to study and train through modelling and simulation may help with organization and rearrangement of working patterns. This may become part of the training of healthcare professionals with a view to focus on specific subjects with an open mind where the clinician remains the ultimate decision-maker.",
