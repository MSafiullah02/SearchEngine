            "text": "Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, a member of the order Nidovirales, and are classified into 3 groups based on the lack of genetic and antigenic relationships between the species of different groups (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003, Masters, 2006). They have been known to cause upper and lower respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, and central nervous system infection in a number of avian and mammalian hosts, including humans (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). The etiological importance of coronaviruses has received much attention since the discovery of the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003. In particular, how coronaviruses break the host species barrier, cause interspecies infection, and become zoonotic are questions of interest to the public. The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, together with the genetically closely related turkey coronavirus (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003, Guy, 2000), pheasant coronavirus (Cavanagh et al., 2002), and viruses recently detected in 3 species of wild birds (Cavanagh et al., 2001), forms group 3 coronaviruses. IBV primarily causes respiratory disease in domestic fowl, although it also replicates at many epithelial surfaces of the alimentary tract, oviduct, and kidney (Cavanagh, 2003), and it is one of the most economically important pathogens in the poultry industry (Cavanagh et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have the largest RNA viral genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases (kb) in length (Masters, 2006). Genetic diversity among coronaviruses is generated by point mutations, insertions, and deletions introduced into the viral genome by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which lacks proofreading capabilities, and by genetic recombination, which occurs by a genomic template-switching mechanism (Masters, 2006). Two-thirds of the viral genome encodes replicase activity and the remaining one-third, structural proteins and small nonstructural (ns) accessory proteins (Masters, 2006). IBV has 4 essential structural proteins, the 3 membrane proteins being the spike (S), integral membrane (M), and small envelope (E) proteins, and a phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein. Although the S1 subunit of the S protein carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific determinants, the S2 subunit may also induce neutralizing antibodies, and the IBV serotypes can be grouped based on the S2 gene sequence (Bosch et al., 2003). The N gene and N-terminus of the IBV M protein also vary between strains (Cavanagh, 2007). Furthermore, mutations and recombination events have been observed in multiple structural genes of IBV recovered from naturally occurring infections.",

Interspersed among the structural protein genes are small ns protein genes that vary in number, position, and sequence among the coronaviruses (Cavanagh, 2007, Masters, 2006). IBV has 2 such genes, genes 3 and 5 (Boursnell et al., 1987). Gene 3 is functionally tricistronic (Liu et al., 1991) with 3 ORFs, 3a, 3b, and 3c. ORFs 3a and 3b of IBV encode 2 small ns proteins of unknown function, 3a and 3b, respectively, and structural protein E is encoded by ORF 3c (Fig. 1\n; Liu and Inglis, 1991, Smith et al., 1990). It has been recently reported that neither the RNA nor the proteins of ORFs 3a and 3b of IBV are essential for replication (Hodgson et al., 2006, Shen et al., 2003). However, in most cases, the reasons that these ORFs have been maintained throughout evolution in natural conditions and the effects of these gene products on animal hosts are yet to be understood.",

This deletion resulted in a frameshift event and therefore, if expressed, it results in a C-terminally truncated protein with 47 deduced amino acids. However, an interesting observation is that a single mutation occurred at the corresponding position of the start codon of CK/CH/LLN/98I (ATG\u2192ATT). This mutation resulted in the virus lacking ORF 3a and changed the primary structure of the 3\u2032-encoding regions of CK/CH/LLN/98I, leading to a novel genomic organization of the avian coronavirus that had the S-3b-3c-M-5a-5b-N gene order from the 5\u2032-end to the 3\u2032-end, instead of the typical gene order in the 3\u2032-encoding regions of group 3 coronaviruses isolated from chicken (IBV) (Boursnell et al., 1987), turkey (Breslin et al., 1999, Cavanagh, 2001, Lin et al., 2002), and pheasants (Cavanagh et al., 2002).

As expected, phylogenetic analysis of S2, 3a, 3b, and 3c genes in the IBV strains in the present study revealed results parallel to its genotype (Fig. 2\n). However, the Chinese IBV isolates exhibited close relationships by phylogenetic analysis of the M, 5a, 5b, and N genes. Analysis of the S2, 3a, 5a, and 5b genes in the vaccine strain JAAS, which was closely related to the Australian IBV strains by S1 gene typing, revealed a greater diversity. Interestingly, in the case of CK/CH/LSD/03I and CK/CH/LLN/98I, the results were varied. Similar to the results of the S1 gene (Liu et al., 2006b), analysis of the S2, 3a, 3b, and 3c genes revealed that CK/CH/LSD/03I belonged to the LX4-type, whereas the analysis of the M, 5a, 5b, and N genes classified this strain into the Mass-type group, suggestive of a recombinant event that occurred during the origin and evolution of CK/CH/LSD/03I. The possible recombinant junction site was determined in the 3c and M genes in this study. As illustrated in Fig. 3\n, the nucleotide sequence alignment of the 3c and M genes of CK/CH.LSD/03I with the pf/CH/LKQ3/03 (Mass-type) and CK/CH/SHH/03I (LX4-type) strains revealed that it shared identical sequences with CH/CK/LSHH/03I for the first 80 bp of the 3c gene; however, it bore a striking homology with the pf/CH/LKQ3/03 strain in the M gene. This shift in homology suggested that the recombinant site might be located at the 3c gene (Fig. 3). Results of the phylogenetic analysis in strain CK/CH/LLN/98I were similar to those in strain CK/CH/LSD/03I. An exchange of genetic information between CK/CH/LTJ/95-like and J9-like strains resulted in CK/CH/LLN/98I sequences in the 3\u2032-encoding region. Sequence alignment revealed that the recombinant site might be located at the beginning of the M gene (Fig. 4\n).",

Since no cell lines could sustain the growth of the IBV strains in this study (data not shown), the 9-day-old embryonated eggs were used to determine the growth ability of virus in vitro. An equal dose (102 EID50) of each virus at passage level 3, using strains CK/CH/LJL/04I, CK/CH/LDL/97I, and CK/CH/LGD/04II carrying the normal 3a gene as controls, was used to inoculate 9-day-old embryos. The inoculated embryos were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, and the allantoic fluid from 3 embryos of each virus was harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively, for virus titration. Based on their movement and the extent of bleeding, curling, and dwarfing, all the inoculated embryos were infected but alive within 72 h. EID50 was determined as the virus titer with each sample. The titers of 5 IBV strains in this study were increased gradually after inoculation with each viral strain from 24 to 72 h (Fig. 5\n). The virus titer of CK/CH/LLN/98I was obviously lower than those of the other 4 strains; the latter 4 viruses exhibited similar titers.",

IBVs have 2 genes termed genes 3 and 5 that are interspersed amongst the structural protein genes. Gene 3 has 3 ORFs, encoding proteins 3a, 3b, and 3c, of which 3c is the E protein. Gene 5 encodes 2 proteins, 5a and 5b. These genes are located as follows: -S-3a, 3b, 3c (E)-M-5a, 5b-N-. In this study, we discovered that a single mutation occurred at the corresponding position of the start codon of CK/CH/LLN/98I due to which this virus lacked ORF 3a. On the other hand, a putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), CTGAACAA, upstream the corresponding position of the 3a gene was detected. Therefore, we considered that the absence of ORF 3a in CK/CH/LLN/98I resulted due to a point mutation at the corresponding position in natural conditions, suggesting that ORF 3a was not necessary for the replication of the virus. This point mutation brought on a novel genomic organization at the 3\u2032-encoding regions of CK/CH/LLN/98I: -S-3b, 3c-M-5a, 5b-N-. Recently, Mardani et al. submitted 3 Australian IBV strains, V6-92 and V18-91 lacking ORFs 3a, 3b, and gene 5 and Q3-88 lacking ORFs 3a, 3b, and 5a in the GenBank database (with accession numbers DQ490219, DQ490220, and DQ490212, respectively). These results and ours in the present study suggest that although the general gene order of IBV is 5\u2032-S-3a, 3b, 3c-M-5a, 5b-N-3\u2032 in the 3\u2032-encoding regions, the absence of nonstructural protein genes was tolerated by the virus, as in other coronaviruses (De Haan et al., 2002). This implies that the native order is not functionally essential, as proven by engineered mutants (Casais et al., 2005, Hodgson et al., 2006).",

Similar to the other IBVs (Boursnell et al., 1987, Cavanagh, 2007), genes 5, N, and M of our 27 viruses were conserved both in nucleotide sequence and in length. However, the sequence length of other genes varied.

It is believed that the conditions for recombination amongst the IBV strains in the field are as follows: an extremely large number of chickens, most maintained at high density; ease of spread of the virus; and serotype co-circulation, including proof of co-infection with more than one serotype in a given flock (Cavanagh, 2007). This is true in the case of CK/CH/LLN/98I and CK/CH/LSD/03I. In China, intensive chicken farms are concentrated in the Shandong and Liaonin provinces, where these 2 viruses have been isolated, respectively (Liu et al., 2006b). Since most of the chickens in these districts are maintained at a high density and intensively exposed to live vaccines, including Mass-type and J9, during the breeding period, the vaccines must certainly be implicated as a source for Mass- and J9-like sequences. The LX4- or CK/CH/LTJ/95I-like sources of genetic material were probably a strain that naturally infects these affected flocks (Liu and Kong, 2004, Liu, 2006b). The natural recombination event demonstrated here could suggest that the continuous use of live vaccines may actually contribute to natural recombination and IBV-associated disease (Wang et al., 1993). A potential recombination junction site was identified in the 5\u2032-portion of the S1 gene upstream the HVR (Binns et al., 1986, Wang et al., 1993); however, CK/CH/LLN/98I and CK/CH/LSD/03I sites in this study were predicted to be located at the 3c and M genes, respectively. This might be due to the sequence conservation in those regions because the polymerase may attach to heterologous templates through base pairing of similar sequences on the newly synthesized strand when recombination occurred.",

            "text": "The predicted proteins of ORF 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b were small and the functions of these gene products are not known. Recently, it was reported that these proteins were accessory proteins (Casais et al., 2005, Hodgson et al., 2006, Shen et al., 2003). Hodgson et al. (2006) modified gene 3 of IBV by using a reverse genetics system and discovered that the recombinant virus titers without the 3a protein produced in CK cells, embryos, and tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) were similar to those of the wild-type virus, although they declined earlier in TOCs, probably due to the absence of the 3a protein. Thus, these authors concluded that neither the tricistronic arrangement of gene 3 nor the 3a protein is essential for replication per se, suggesting that this protein may have roles in vivo (Hodgson et al., 2006). Our results indicate that a 43-bp nucleotide sequence was deleted at the 3\u2032-end of the 3a gene in the IBV strain CK/CH/LSD/03I, resulting in a frameshift event and a C-terminally truncated protein, with 47 deduced amino acids. However, this strain had growth ability in embryos similar to that of other IBV strains. Moreover, the pathogenicity and replication in chicks were also identical to IBVs with the normal 3a gene in our study, suggesting that the deleted sequence was not essential for virus replication and pathogenesis either in vitro or in vivo. However, it is intriguing to note that the CK/CH/LLN/98I lacking ORF 3a had a visibly lower titer in embryos at 72 h post-inoculation compared with the other IBV strains carrying normal ORF 3a. The virus adapted ability in embryos varied among IBV strains, and we could not conclude that such a change may be due to the defect of ORF 3a. However, the other genes in the 3\u2032-encoding region of CK/CH/LLN/98I had highly conserved sequences and structures with other strains. Although the relationship between the change in the virus titer and ORF 3a defect in this virus required confirmation by using the reverse genetics system, CK/CH/LLN/98I lacking ORF 3a as a wild-type IBV strain could be a more useful study tool as compared to the mutant engineered using the reverse genetic system. It is hypothesized that gene 3 may play important roles in the coronavirus pathogenesis to avian species. The replication and pathogenicity of CK/CH/LLN/98I was compared to those of the other IBV strains with normal ORF 3a by infecting chickens at a similar dose (EID50) of virus. All 5 IBV strains could infect chickens, induce specific antibody, and secrete offspring viruses from the respiratory tract. Although we did not qualify the secreted viruses and evaluate the precise differences of replication ability from these viruses in chickens, our observation suggested that CK/CH/LLN/98I lacking ORF 3a could effectively replicate in vivo and infect chickens.",
