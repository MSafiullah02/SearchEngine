It is the final generalized inflammatory response of the lung to catastrophic events of various pulmonary and nonpulmonary origins and occurs in all age groups. The diagnostic criteria have been established by an American-European Consensus Conference [1, 2, 3]. ARDS in children is still associated with a high mortality. Mortality is correlated with the severity of the underlying disease [4, 5]; however, it is still generally accepted that the degree of hypoxemia predicts outcome [5, 6, 7, 8]. Mortality in children with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio lower than 100 in central Europe is still greater than 50% [5]. Another outcome criteria is the aggressiveness of ventilatory support, reflected in the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure, and ventilation index [9, 10]. The enforcement of standardized ventilation protocols and the lower incidence of both multiple trauma and sepsis in central Europe have caused a continuous decrease in severe ARDS incidence in children [11, 12, 13].",

Nevertheless, randomized controlled studies evaluating new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of severe hypoxemic ARDS as nitric oxide, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and surfactant treatment are lacking in the pediatric age group [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Exogenous surfactant improves oxygenation in neonates not only with respiratory distress syndrome but also in other conditions with secondary surfactant deficit such as meconium aspiration syndrome and congenital pneumonia, comparable with ARDS [19]. Oxygenation improved after surfactant administration in several case reports on adult ARDS patients [11, 20] and in a controlled study in moderate pediatric ARDS [10]. A retrospective and prospective survey of pediatric ARDS in all major German pediatric intensive care facilities demonstrated that the mortality and chronic illness after ARDS in patients with PaO2/FIO2 ratios above 150 is very rare, and that most patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio around 200 are not even ventilated [5]. For this reason the German-Austrian working group on ARDS performed a controlled, randomized study in severe, hypoxemic ARDS in children, associated with a very high mortality, and no evidence-based treatment options available.",

Ventilation in the pilot study was in accordance with the ventilation algorithm established by the German Working Group on Pediatric ARDS (Fig. 1). A bovine surfactant (Alveofact, Boehringer, Ingelheim, Germany) was administered in 50 mg/kg increments (intratracheal bolus under continuous ventilation and PEEP over maximally 5 min) as long as the PaO2/FIO2 ratio did not increase by 20% or decrease by 10%. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio was determined at 48 h The increase/decrease from baseline was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. No other exclusion criteria were applicable [17, 19]. This pilot study as the following mulitcenter study were approved by the ethics review board of the principal investigators' institution (Medical University of L\u00fcbeck).\n",

As surfactant is a major biological factor for alveolar recruitment, surfactant deficit is a key problem in ARDS, and substitution of surfactant in ARDS could be an important therapeutic tool [19, 23, 26]. As early as 1989 it was hypothesized that surfactant could be of therapeutic value not only in premature infant's respiratory distress syndrome but also in ARDS [24]. In that year the first case report of a successfully surfactant-treated child with severe hypoxemic ARDS was published [27]. Surfactant therapy in preterm infants is now based on sound data (e.g., [28, 29, 30]). In respiratory failure of term infants, in some ways resembling ARDS, a randomized study demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for ECMO [31]. Several uncontrolled studies have been published on adult ARDS [32, 33]; a large controlled study using small doses of aerosolized synthetic surfactant found no advantage of surfactant [33], and a smaller administering a bolus reported improved oxygenation and slightly increased survival in the treatment group [34]. In the pediatric population surfactant has been used in several case reports and in small uncontrolled studies of near fatal ARDS [17, 19, 24, 35]. In mild to moderate ARDS (Hallman oxygenation index less than 10) a randomized study demonstrated improved oxygenation immediately after surfactant administration and most ventilation-associated parameters [36]. In patients with severe hypoxemia we observed a short period of improved oxygenation, as in the study by Willson et al. [36] in patients with less severe hypoxemia.",

The trend towards a decreased mortality and need for rescue medication in such a high mortality population might nevertheless be important as no other evidence-based treatment option exists. Surfactant may be only one factor in improving oxygenation in severe ARDS; it enhances the benefits of the \"open lung concept,\" prone positioning, and NO-induced pulmonary vasodilatation [25, 38, 39]. The improvement in oxygenation in the control group, which was managed only on a strictly enforced ventilation algorithm and blood pressure and fluid intake protocol, suggests that standardized treatment alone using conventional methods leads to an overall improvement in patient outcome. This is in line with similar findings by Steinhard et al. [12] who reported improved patient outcome simply by introducing enforced ventilatory management protocols. Surfactant might also be directly involved in improving the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in ARDS and therefore be a causative approach [39, 40, 41]. The design of modified surfactant solutions being more prone against inactivation by different proteins in the course of ARDS could enhance and prolong the effect of surfactant on oxygenation [42].",

This would be in accordance with experimental results in which in pneumonia surfactant inactivation was increased, compared with other causes of ARDS [38]. Higher doses of the surfactant preparation used cannot be applied as they would obstruct the major airways. A second dose showed no benefit in our study, either in the data analysis of primary and secondary endpoint criteria or in the post hoc analysis of subgroups. If at all, higher initial doses in selected patients could be considered if a preparation were available with lower volume, lower viscosity, and perhaps more prone to inactivation. Surfactant treatment with a listed price of \u20ac200\u2013400/100 mg is still very expensive.",

Many \"intended to treat\" patients could not be randomized as they had underlying lung or heart disease, were dying at arrival in the ICU, or had been ventilated for more than 5 days in regional hospitals. An additional difficulty for such a study is the decreasing incidence of ARDS in children. Our study confirmed results of a previous randomized study by Willson et al. [38] reporting improved oxygenation in pediatric patients with mild to moderate ARDS. The improvement in oxygenation was sustained for patients without pneumonia as underlying disease and with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio greater than 65. The latter subgroup does not seem to benefit from any other available rescue tool at this moment. Ventilation variables could be reduced in the surfactant group. The devastating consequences of aggressive ventilation in these children with severe ARDS can probably be ameliorated with surfactant treatment. We conclude that surfactant treatment in severe pediatric ARDS might offer benefits to the patients.",
