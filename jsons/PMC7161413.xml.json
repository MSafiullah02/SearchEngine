A study of 61 dogs with lymphoma demonstrated a prognostic advantage in dogs with trisomy of chromosome 13 (25% of the dogs studied), as evidenced by increase in duration of first remission and overall survival time (ST).20 Germline and somatic genetic mutations and altered oncogene/tumor suppressor gene expression, epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA hypomethylation), signal transduction, and death-pathway alterations (e.g., Bcl-2 family) are common in human lymphomas and have been reported in the dog as well (see Chapter 1,\nSection A, and Chapter 15, Section B).21, 22, 23, 24, 25 These include N-ras, p53, Rb, p16 cyclin-dependent kinase, telomerase, and NF-\u03baB among others.22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 Somatic mutations, as determined by exome sequencing, have shown much overlap in canine breeds with respect to B-cell lymphoma, specifically mutations in TRAF3-MAP3K14, FBXW7, and POT1, but little overlap in somatic mutations among breeds with T-cell lymphoma.21 In addition, differences in the prevalence of immunophenotypic subtypes of lymphoma among different breeds indicate heritable risks.32 Telomerase activity (see Chapter 2) has also been documented in canine lymphoma tissues.33, 34, 35 As somatic mutations are often implicated, it is not surprising that alterations or deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms would also be implicated, as has been demonstrated in golden retrievers with lymphoma.36\n",

Many histologic systems have been used to classify NHL in humans, and some of these have been applied to lymphoma in the dog and other species. Histologic classification of lymphoma currently follows the Revised European American Lymphoma/World Health Organization (REAL/WHO) system, which incorporates anatomic, morphologic (cytology and histology), and immunophenotypic criteria (B- and T-cell immunophenotype), with the goal of enabling accurate and reproducible diagnosis of specific neoplastic entities.90, 95, 96\nFig. 33.3\nrepresents an overall histologic approach to the classification of various subtypes in the dog as reviewed by Seelig et al.96, 97 This theoretically should assist in better tailoring of treatment protocols, better correlation of prognosis with subtype, and better comparative capabilities once larger data sets with correlate outcomes are generated. Table 33.1\nshows some of the WHO categories in three different surveys, including a 2-year survey (2008\u20132009) of canine necropsy and biopsy cases at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Veterinary Care Hospital29, 95, 96, 98; some of the less common categories in the REAL/WHO system were not represented and are not listed. Most canine lymphomas fall into the following categories, in decreasing frequency: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), T-zone lymphoma (TZL), T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (also called \u201cprecursor T-cell neoplasia\u201d), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).90 The REAL/WHO system provides accurate and consistent reproducible diagnostic results similar to the system used in human pathology; agreement among a group of pathologists examining 300 cases was 83%, and accuracy in evaluating the six most common diagnoses (80% of the cases) was 87%.99 It is clear that lymphoma is not a single disease, and classification by subtype will become increasingly important as clinical studies are performed to correlate the various categories of disease with biologic behavior, response to treatment, and prognosis. Preliminary results indicate that dogs with indolent lymphoma (e.g., MZL, follicular lymphoma, B- or T-cell small cell lymphoma, T-cell\u2013rich B-cell lymphoma, and TZL) maintain normal activity and appetite levels even during advanced stages of disease and experience long-term survival even with limited or no therapy.90, 99, 100, 101, 102\n",

Most of the larger compilations agree that most canine lymphomas are intermediate or high grade. The WF categorizes tumors according to pattern (diffuse or follicular) and cell type (e.g., small cleaved cell, large cell, immunoblastic), but it does not include information about the immunophenotype of the tumor.103 The WF subtypes are related to the biology of the tumor and patient survival. The updated Kiel classification includes the architectural pattern, morphology (centroblastic, centrocytic, or immunoblastic), and immunophenotype (B or T cell) of the tumor cells.104 In both systems, the tumors can then be categorized as low-grade, intermediate-grade, or high-grade malignancies. Low-grade lymphomas composed of small cells with a low mitotic rate typically progress slowly and are associated with long STs, but are ultimately incurable. High-grade lymphomas with a high mitotic rate progress rapidly, but are more likely to respond initially to chemotherapy and, in humans, are potentially curable. In the REAL/WHO system, each subtype of lymphoma is classified as a distinct disease based on characteristics that include biologic behavior (indolent versus aggressive, response to treatment).90\n",

The REAL/WHO system does include anatomic location as a factor in determining certain categories. Although differences between nodal and extranodal tumors in biologic behavior and prognosis are well recognized, comparative information about the histogenesis of these tumors is lacking. For example, in humans, small-cell lymphomas arising from MALT are composed of cells with a different immunophenotype than that of other small-cell lymphomas (i.e., MALT lymphomas typically are negative for both CD5 and CD10). With the exception of cutaneous lymphoid neoplasms, detailed characterization of extranodal lymphomas in dogs has not been done. Although cutaneous lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that includes an epitheliotropic form resembling mycosis fungoides and a nonepitheliotropic form, most cutaneous lymphomas have a T-cell phenotype.119\n",

Multicentric lymphoma, the most common form, is usually distinguished by the presence of generalized peripheral lymphadenopathy (see Fig. 33.1). Enlarged LNs are usually painless, rubbery, and discrete. In addition, hepatosplenomegaly and bone marrow involvement can be associated with generalized lymphadenopathy. Most dogs with multicentric lymphoma are presented without dramatic signs of systemic illness (WHO substage a) (Box 33.2\n); however, a diversity of nonspecific signs such as anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, emaciation, ascites, dyspnea, polydipsia, polyuria, and fever can occur (WHO substage b). Dogs with T-cell lymphoma are more likely to have constitutional (i.e., substage b) signs. Most veterinary oncologists consider mild-moderate severity of clinical signs sufficient for a substage b designation.120 Polydipsia and polyuria are often evident in dogs with hypercalcemia of malignancy. Dogs may also be presented with clinical signs related to blood dyscrasias secondary to marked tumor infiltration of bone marrow (myelophthisis) or paraneoplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia. These could include fever, sepsis, anemia, and hemorrhage. Diffuse pulmonary infiltration, as detected by radiographic changes, is seen in 27% to 34% of dogs with the multicentric form (Fig. 33.4\n).121, 122 Based on bronchoalveolar lavage, the actual incidence of lung involvement may be higher.123, 124\nBOX 33.2World Health Organization\u2019s Clinical Staging System for Lymphoma in Domestic Animals\n1.Anatomic siteA.GeneralizedB.AlimentaryC.ThymicD.SkinE.Leukemia (true)a\nF.Others (including solitary renal)\n2.Stage (to include anatomic site)I.Involvement limited to a single node or lymphoid tissue in a single organb\nII.Involvement of many lymph nodes in a regional area (\u00b1 tonsils)III.Generalized lymph node involvementIV.Liver and/or spleen involvement (\u00b1 Stage III)V.Manifestation in the blood and involvement of bone marrow and/or other organ systems (\u00b1 Stage I\u2013IV)\n\nEach stage is subclassified into:a.Without systemic signsb.With systemic signs\n",

Epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma (e.g., mycosis fungoides) typically has a clinical course with three apparent clinical stages. Initially, there will be scaling, alopecia, and pruritus (Fig. 33.6A\n), which can mimic a variety of other skin conditions. As the disease progresses, the skin becomes more erythematous, thickened, ulcerated, and exudative. The final stage is characterized by proliferative plaques and nodules with progressive ulceration (Fig. 33.6B). Oral mucocutaneous involvement may also occur and this can appear as multicentric erythematous plaque-like hypopigmented lesions or nodules associated with the gum and lips (Fig. 33.6C). Extracutaneous involvement can also occur, most often in the LNs, spleen, liver, and bone marrow/peripheral blood. Nonepitheliotropic cutaneous lymphomas are also quite variable in appearance and can form single or multiple dermal or subcutaneous nodules or plaques that may be nonpuritic, ulcerated, or alopecic with crusts.71 The face (lips, nasal planum, eyelids), lower extremities (paws, interdigital folds), neck, and trunk are often affected.",

In addition, if significant myelophthisis is present, anemia may be accompanied by thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.145, 146 In animals with anemia or evidence of bleeding, in addition to a platelet count, a reticulocyte count and coagulation testing may be indicated. Thrombocytopenia occurs in 30% to 50% of cases, but bleeding is seldom a clinical problem. Neutrophilia occurs in 25% to 40% of dogs and lymphocytosis occurs in approximately 20% of affected dogs. Circulating atypical lymphocytes may be indicative of bone marrow involvement and leukemia. It is important to differentiate multicentric lymphoma with bone marrow involvement (i.e., stage V disease) from primary lymphocytic leukemia because the prognosis for each may be different.

In cases of hypercalcemia of unknown origin, lymphoma should always be considered high on the differential disease list and diagnostic testing directed at this possibility should be undertaken (see Chapter 5). In addition, the presence of hypercalcemia can serve as a biomarker for response to therapy and relapse. Increased urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations can occur secondary to renal infiltration with tumor, hypercalcemic nephrosis, or prerenal azotemia from dehydration.

            "text": "Morphologic and phenotypic examination of the tissue and cells that constitute the tumor is essential to the diagnosis and subtyping of lymphoma. In humans, a combination of histologic, immunophenotypic, clinical, and genetic features are used in the diagnosis and subtyping of NHL. An excellent review of the morphologic and immunophenotypic diagnostic features of canine lymphoma has recently been published.96 In veterinary medicine, care should be taken to avoid sampling LNs from reactive areas (e.g., mandibular LNs), unless those nodes are the only ones enlarged; the prescapular or popliteal LNs are preferable if also involved. Also, lymphocytes are fragile, and in preparing smears of aspirated material only gentle pressure should be applied in spreading material on the slides. As the majority of dogs with nodal lymphomas are presented with multicentric effacement of peripheral LNs by intermediate or large lymphocytes, cytologic examination of FNAs of affected LNs or other tissues is a highly sensitive and specific first-line or screening diagnostic step.96 Typically, most of the cells are large lymphocytes (>2 times the diameter of a red blood cell or larger than a neutrophil), and they may have visible nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm with or without paranuclear clear zones (Fig. 33.7A\n) or fine chromatin with indistinct nucleoli. Because tissue architecture is not maintained in cytologic specimens, effacement of the node or capsular disruption cannot be detected. Therefore marked reactive hyperplasia characterized by increased numbers of large lymphocytes may be difficult to distinguish from lymphoma. In some forms of lymphoma, intermediate lymphocytes that are similar in diameter to neutrophils predominate; these specimens can be more challenging for novice cytopathologists. Small-cell lymphomas may have few cytologic clues that point to malignancy. Therefore classification of lymphoma into subtypes that make up the low-, intermediate-, and high-grade forms can be attempted using cytologic appearance and immunophenotypic analysis of cytologic specimens (Fig. 33.7B),96, 148, 149, 150 but is performed most accurately on histologic sections. Although cytologic findings identified by an experienced cytopathologist may suggest a particular subtype of lymphoma, subsequent analysis that may include flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, biopsy for histologic examination, clonality assays, and cytogenetic analysis are required to further subtype the lymphoma or to confirm or establish a diagnosis in equivocal cases. Fig. 33.8\npresents a diagnostic algorithm for assessing peripheral lymphadenopathy in dogs applying these techniques, beginning with initial screening by cytologic examination.",

Multiple samples may be necessary to accurately diagnose segmental disease. Endoscopic biopsies may be inadequate as only a superficial specimen is obtained; however, more aggressive endoscopic biopsy techniques combined with more accurate histopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular assessments are improving the diagnostic yield of these less invasive techniques.125, 126, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162 In many dogs with primary GI lymphoma, an inflammatory nonneoplastic infiltrate (i.e., LP-IBD) may be misdiagnosed on biopsy specimens that are too superficial. The application of assays for clonal expansion (e.g., receptor gene rearrangement [PARR]) does not appear as yet to be as accurate for endoscopically derived intestinal biopsies as it is for other solid lymphoid tumors in dogs.",

The immunophenotype of a lymphocyte is identified by determining the expression of molecules specific for B cells (e.g., CD79a, CD20) and T cells (e.g., CD3), and have been recently reviewed.96 Although tumor cells sometimes have morphologic characteristics that typify a particular immunophenotype, exceptions occur and morphologic appearance cannot be used as the sole determinant of immunophenotype. For example, in a series of nine high-grade T-cell lymphomas and leukemias in dogs, the cells had a plasmacytoid appearance typically associated with B-cell lymphoma.123, 192 Similarly, anatomic location does not always predict the immunophenotype.",

Flow cytometric evaluation of cells obtained by needle aspiration is also feasible. For T cells, markers include CD3 (pan T), CD4 (helper T), and CD8 (cytotoxic T); for B cells, the markers are CD79a (see Fig. 33.7B), CD20, and CD21, although dogs with indolent TZL can express CD21.178 Increasingly, aberrant expression of CD molecules has been reported in canine lymphoma. In a study of 59 dogs with lymphoma, tumor cells from six dogs were positive for both T- and B-cell markers; however, a clonality assay revealed clonality either of the T-cell or the immunoglobulin receptor, but not both. This indicates that, in some cases, the malignant cells may coexpress B- and T-cell markers.118 Antibodies against these molecules are used to determine the immunophenotype; however, they also have potential utility as a therapeutic modality if tumor cells could be targeted using these antibodies.

            "text": "Information about the clinical presentation and morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of the lymphocytes, obtained by IHC or flow cytometric analysis, must be integrated to select appropriate targets for clonality testing and to interpret results accurately.193 Occasionally, diagnosis of lymphoma and differentiation of malignant versus benign proliferation of lymphocytes are not possible based on standard histologic and cytologic criteria. In these cases, advanced molecular analyses may be helpful to confirm a diagnosis. Clonality is the hallmark of malignancy; that is, the malignant cell population theoretically should be derived from expansion of a single malignant clone characterized by a particular DNA region unique to that tumor. For example, in a dog with T-cell lymphoma, all the malignant cells theoretically should have the same DNA sequence for the variable region of the T-cell receptor gene. Likewise, in a dog with B-cell lymphoma, the tumor cells should have identical DNA sequences in the variable region of the immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor gene. Conversely, in reactive lymphocytosis, the cells are polyclonal for their antigen receptors. Using this knowledge, investigators have used PCR technology to amplify the variable regions of the T-cell and immunoglobulin receptor genes to detect the presence of clonal lymphocyte populations in dogs (see Fig. 8.3 of Chapter 8). These techniques are reviewed in Chapter 8 and elsewhere.158, 180, 193, 194, 195 In physician-based medicine, such assays of clonality are approximately 70% to 90% sensitive and have a false-positive rate of approximately 5%, and recent studies report similar rates in dogs. False-negative and false-positive results can occur with clonality assays. For example, cells from a dog with lymphoma may be negative for clonality if the clonal segment of DNA is not detected with the PCR primers used, mutation of the primer site has occurred, there are background nonneoplastic lymphocytes (noise) within the tumor, the malignant cells are natural killer (NK) cells (rare), or the malignant cells are present in too low a frequency to be detected. False positives occur rarely in some infectious diseases (e.g., ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis). In these cases, a diagnosis should be made only after considering the results of all the diagnostic tests, including histologic/cytologic evaluation, immunophenotyping, and clonality studies in conjunction with signalment and physical examination findings. These molecular techniques, although helpful for diagnosis, could also have utility in detecting relapse and in determining more accurate clinical stage and so-called \u201cmolecular remission rates\u201d because they are more sensitive than standard cytologic assessment of peripheral blood, bone marrow, or LNs.",

It is important to remember these cells also can be seen with immune-mediated and inflammatory/infectious diseases. As discussed previously, tumor cells within the peripheral and bone marrow compartments can also be identified using clonality assays (PARR) that are more sensitive than routine microscopic examination in detecting malignant cells; however, the prognostic significance of the knowledge gained with more sensitive staging methodologies has yet to be determined.216, 217, 218 Although bone marrow evaluation may offer prognostically valuable information, it is not necessary to perform the procedure if the client is committed to treat regardless of stage.",

Cranial mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected in 20% of dogs with lymphoma.122, 220 Abdominal radiographs reveal evidence of involvement of medial iliac (sublumbar) and/or mesenteric LNs, spleen, or liver in approximately 50% of cases. In the authors\u2019 practice, for the typical cases of canine multicentric lymphoma, imaging is limited to thoracic radiographs as there is no prognostic difference between dogs with stage III and IV disease (i.e., liver/spleen involvement); however, cranial mediastinal lymphadenopathy is of prognostic significance. If there are clinical signs attributable to abdominal disease, if complete staging is necessary (e.g., for clinical trial inclusion), or if peripheral lymphadenopathy is not part of the presentation, further imaging of the abdomen is warranted. Abdominal ultrasonography can be important for obtaining ultrasound-guided intraabdominal samples for diagnosis if more peripheral lesions are not evident (e.g., GI, abdominal nodal, and hepatosplenic lymphoma) or if complete clinical staging is required.152 Ultrasonographic (including Doppler ultrasound) assessment of peripheral LNs has also been explored153; however, its clinical applicability is questionable because cytologic assessment of peripheral nodes is easy, inexpensive, and of higher diagnostic utility.",

Few of these studies include sufficient numbers of dogs for adequate statistical power and even fewer compare treatment protocols in a randomized prospective fashion. In addition, staging, inclusion, and response criteria vary considerably among reports. Therefore evaluations of efficacy among various protocols are subject to substantial bias, making direct comparisons difficult and indeed precarious. A recurring theme in the concluding statement in most of these published protocols is some variation of \u201cprospective randomized trials will be required to confirm these suggestive findings.\u201d Despite the plethora of available combination protocols, most are modifications of CHOP protocols initially designed for human oncologic use, and currently randomized prospective evidence does not exist in dogs to clearly recommend one over the other as long as the basic CHOP components are present. CHOP represents combinations of cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H, hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine (O, Oncovin), and prednisone (P). In the 1980s and early 1990s, physicians treating human patients with advanced, intermediate- or high-grade lymphoma faced a similar dilemma in that many different variations of CHOP existed and no randomized data were available to determine which protocols were superior. Eventually, a national randomized trial involving more than 1000 people with intermediate/high grade NHL was conducted comparing the plethora of protocols available, and the results indicated that CHOP was as effective as any of the more complicated protocols and had the safest adverse event profile.252 CHOP subsequently became (and remains, with the addition of monoclonal antibody therapy) the standard of care for people with intermediate-/high-grade NHL.",

            "text": "An unanswered question in the treatment of lymphoma has been whether long-term maintenance chemotherapy is useful after an initial course of aggressive induction chemotherapy lasting 6 months or less. Long-term maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be of significant value in humans with most aggressive forms of NHL; however, in humans, the initial induction course of chemotherapy is much more aggressive than that used in veterinary patients. Although no randomized prospective studies have been performed to address the therapeutic benefit of long-term maintenance chemotherapy in dogs, most comparisons of dogs treated with CHOP-based protocols do not show any clear advantage for a maintenance or consolidation phase after induction therapy.229, 231, 232, 234, 240, 242, 243, 244, 245, 247, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262 Indeed, in most reports, dogs receiving shorter, less costly protocols that do not include a prolonged maintenance phase have comparable remission and progression-free survival (PFS) durations and appear to more readily achieve second remissions when they relapse after completion of chemotherapy than their counterparts receiving long-term maintenance. These data, taken together, suggest that maintenance therapy is not beneficial for most dogs with lymphoma. Until well-designed randomized prospective trials indicate otherwise, the author (DMV) prefers protocols that utilize an aggressive induction without maintenance.",

This is a valid question; however, the answer remains elusive because adequately powered randomized controlled trials do not currently exist to demonstrate if an alternate protocol is better for this immunophenotype. Several alternative protocols (MOPP, LOPP, VELCAP-TSC) have been reported and reviewed for induction therapy in dogs with multicentric T-cell lymphoma.110, 284, 285, 286 These alternative protocols tend to add or substitute alkylating agents (e.g., nitrogen mustard, lomustine, procarbazine) for DOX. Although reports have suggested improvements in remission durations in dogs with either confirmed T-cell lymphoma or lymphoma with hypercalcemia and no immunophenotypic classification, the confidence intervals of the medians all overlap with data from CHOP-based protocols, and differences in determining PFS, response evaluation, and study population (in particular, some do not adequately distinguish indolent multicentric lymphoma) in these reports preclude confident comparisons. As yet, no controlled, randomized trials have documented improvement with this approach. Ultimately, the development of better protocols for treating T-cell lymphoma awaits careful, randomized, prospective trial assessment. Until such time, the author prefers to initiate CHOP-based induction and switch to lomustine-based rescue at the first sign of progression or to enter dogs into clinical trials with novel agents. Although species differences may exist, in people with aggressive T-cell NHL, alternative protocols rich in alkylating agents have not shown superiority over CHOP-based protocols, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend human patient participation in clinical trials as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for aggressive nonindolent T-cell lymphomas.",

This brings veterinary outcome reporting more in line with human standards. Because the majority of dogs with lymphoma eventually experience relapse after chemotherapy-induced remissions and because methodology for differentiating complete and partial responses is analysis dependent on how responses are determined, PFS removes many sources of bias. Further, overall survival in published reports invariably includes patients who go on to receive varied rescue protocols that bias the overall result, making it a less comparable outcome. Widespread application of these standardized criteria should permit more suitable comparisons in the future. True iCR rarely occur in dogs with lymphoma; documenting iCRs is limited to investigative trials striving to achieve them because we lack meaningful therapeutic options.",

The cumulative dose of DOX that will result from reinduction, baseline cardiac assessment, the use of cardioprotectants, alternative drug choices, and client education should all be considered. In general, the duration of reinduction remission will be half that encountered in the initial therapy; however, a subset of animals will enjoy long-term reinductions, especially if the dog completed the initial induction treatment protocol and was currently not receiving chemotherapy for several months when relapse occurred. Reinduction rates of nearly 80% to 90% can be expected in dogs that have completed CHOP-based protocols and then relapse while not receiving therapy.232, 300 The duration of a second CHOP-based remission in one report was predicted by the duration of the interval between protocols and the duration of the first remission.123, 300\n",

These are single drugs or drug combinations that are typically not found in standard CHOP protocols and are withheld for use in the drug-resistant setting. The most common rescue protocols used in dogs include single-agent use or a combination of rabacfosadine, actinomycin D, mitoxantrone, DOX (if DOX was not part of the original induction protocol), dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide, lomustine (CCNU), l-asparaginase, mechlorethamine, vincristine, vinblastine, procarbazine, prednisone, and etoposide. Some rescue protocols are relatively simple and convenient single-agent treatments, whereas others are more complicated (and expensive) multiagent protocols, such as MOPP. Overall rescue response rates of 40% to 90% are reported; however, responses are usually not durable with median response durations of 1.5 to 2.5 months being typical regardless of the complexity of the protocol. A small (<20%) subset of animals will enjoy longer rescue durations. Table 33.5\nprovides a summary of canine rescue protocols and published results.270, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320 Current published data from rescue protocols do not include sufficient numbers for adequate statistical power, nor do they compare protocols in a controlled, randomized prospective fashion. Therefore comparative evaluations of efficacy among various protocols are subject to substantial bias, making direct comparisons difficult. Choice of a particular rescue protocol should depend on several factors, including cost, time commitment required, efficacy, adverse event profile, and experience of the clinician with the protocols in question. As the complexity of rescue protocols does not yet appear to be associated with significant gains in rescue durability, the author (DMV) tends to choose simpler and less costly protocols (e.g., CCNU/l-asparaginase/prednisone) (Table 33.6\n); however, the use of multiple varied rescue protocols, switching as needed based on response, continues as long as clients are comfortable with their dog\u2019s quality of life. This sequential application of several different rescue protocols can result in several months of extended survival with acceptable quality of life.",

Mechanisms of avoiding or abrogating MDR, enhancing tumor apoptosis (programmed cell death), tumor ablation, and immune-system reconstitution, as well as novel immunomodulatory therapies for lymphoma, are all active areas of investigation in both human and veterinary medicine.",

The \u201cR\u201d refers to rituximab (Rituxan), a recombinant chimeric murine/human antibody directed against the CD20 antigen, a hydrophobic transmembrane protein located on normal pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. After binding, rituximab triggers a host cytotoxic immune response against CD20-positive cells. Unfortunately, rituximab does not have therapeutic activity in dogs because of a lack of external recognition of a similar antigen on canine lymphoma cells and the inherent antigenicity of human-derived antibodies in dogs.321, 322 Recently, caninized mAb designed to target either B-cell (blontuvetmab; Blontress) or T-cell (tamtuvetmab; Tactress) lymphomas were conditionally approved by the USDA for use in dogs with lymphoma; however, after being assessed in prospective clinical trials involving a large number of dogs, their target specificity was found to be inadequate to effect clinical efficacy, and they are no longer available and are not currently recommended for use. Several laboratories throughout the world are working to characterize and develop more specific and effective mAb therapies for use in canine lymphoma,323, 324, 325, 326 and practitioners await their development.",

The remaining 11 dogs (66%) had a CR, and seven dogs had a MST of 14 months. No staging or histologic information was provided, so the information appears of limited usefulness, although those with follow-up lived approximately 1 year. In two reports of indolent nodular lymphoma of the spleen (MZL and mantle cell lymphoma [MCL]), outcome was available on seven MZL cases, including three cases that did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery,100, 102 and only one died of lymphoma after splenectomy. In a recent report of indolent lymphomas, four splenic lymphomas (three MZL and one MCL) underwent splenectomy alone and all survived more than 1 year, with none dying of their primary disease.101 In another report of 41 dogs undergoing splenectomy for lymphoma, those dogs with indolent forms enjoyed long-term survival.339 Splenectomy should be considered if the lymphoma is not documented in other sites after thorough staging, if lymphoma is an indolent form, or if splenic rupture has occurred. Of note, no control population consisting of dogs that did not undergo splenectomy exists, so the natural history of indolent splenic lymphoma remains uncertain.",

Solitary lesions have a better prognosis and may be treated with surgical excision or RT, although thorough staging for systemic disease should be undertaken before local therapy and active surveillance for subsequent development of recurrent or systemic involvement should be implemented. Fractionated RT has been associated with long-term control.366, 367 Diffuse cutaneous lymphoma is best managed with systemic therapy, although the rate and durability of response is generally less than in multicentric lymphoma. The most widely used protocols for epitheliotropic and nonepitheliotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) include CCNU (with or without l-asparaginase [see Table 33.6]) along with prednisone, pegylated l-asparaginase (very costly), and oral retinoic acid analogs (limited availability; acitretin, etretinate, isotretinoin).269, 366, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372 Multiagent protocols (generally CHOP-based) may also be used, but have generally been instituted after single-agent therapies have failed. Although reported response rates can range from 40% to 80%, median remission durations are generally short (approximately 3\u20136 months); occasionally, durable remissions are encountered. Sporadic reports of other therapies for cutaneous lymphoma in small numbers of cases include the use of COAP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine [Oncovin], Ara-C, and prednisone), topical mechlorethamine (Mustargen), rabacfosadine, recombinant human interferon-alpha, and masitinib.132, 269, 368, 373 All these reports involved small numbers of cases and resulted in relatively short response durations. Whole-body surface RT has also been explored for the treatment of diffuse cutaneous lymphoma in preliminary trials.348, 374\n",

Dogs with low-grade indolent lymphomas have a poorer response to chemotherapy, yet have a survival advantage over dogs with intermediate- and high-grade lymphomas (see Fig. 33.12). Several case compilations have documented that dogs with indolent lymphoma (e.g., MZL, MCL, TZL) experience prolonged STs, often in the absence of any or aggressive chemotherapy; that is, they often enjoy prolonged survival despite intervention rather than because of intervention.100, 101, 102 One caveat is that canine nodal marginal zone lymphoma, which is designated as an indolent disorder, is generally more aggressive with median progression-free intervals of 5 months and overall STs of only 8.5 months; this is substantially less than splenic MZL, which is associated with long-term survival or cure after splenectomy.108 Many dogs with indolent lymphoma will live near normal life-spans and ultimately die of non\u2013lymphoma-related disorders. Generally, with the indolent lymphomas, unless the presence of disease is having an effect on the quality of life or results in clinically significant cytopenias (myelophthisis), active surveillance in the absence of treatment is recommended. If treatment is deemed necessary, more conservative protocols (e.g., chlorambucil/prednisone or cyclophosphamide/prednisone) are initiated. The goal of therapy is to control the disease (stable disease or partial response) as CRs are unusual with the indolent lymphomas.\n",

Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the large lymphocytes is the nuclear chromatin pattern, which typically is less condensed than the chromatin in small lymphocytes but more condensed than the chromatin in myeloblasts. Large lymphocytes are larger than neutrophils, have a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and contain basophilic cytoplasm (see Fig. 33.13). Nucleoli, although present, are less prominent in large lymphocytes than in myeloblasts. Nevertheless, these cells cannot be distinguished easily from immature cells of other hematopoietic lineages, and identification of lineage-specific markers by immunocytochemical, flow cytometric, or molecular/genetic analysis is required to ascertain their lineage.401, 403, 404 If the cells express CD34, a stem-cell marker, an acute phenotype is implied170, 394, 399; however, both myeloid and lymphoid lineages express CD34 and our ability to differentiate ALL from acute myeloid leukemia relies on detection of other markers, including T- and B-cell markers and myeloperoxidase, a myeloid marker.

In more advanced disease, some owners report lethargy and decreased appetite. Mild lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly may be present, although late in the disease splenomegaly may be marked.405 In a compilation of nearly 500 dogs with B-CLL, 50% had some degree of peripheral lymphadenopathy, 50% had splenomegaly, 30% had hepatomegaly, 23% had visceral lymphadenopathy, and 3% had a mediastinal mass.106 The white blood cell (WBC) count is usually >30,000 cells/\u03bcL but can vary from normal to more than 100,000 cells/\u03bcL because of an increase in circulating mature lymphocytes. Lymphocytosis is persistent, and granulocytes are usually present in normal numbers. Other than lymphocytosis, hemograms of dogs with CLL tend to have few abnormalities when lymphocytes are less than 30,000/\u03bcL.170, 394, 400 Mild anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are common, but may become marked as the disease progresses and lymphocyte counts increase above 30,000/\u03bcL. In B-CLL, the median lymphocyte count was 24,600/\u03bcL and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were uncommon (1% and 7%, respectively).106 Despite the well-differentiated appearance of the lymphocytes in CLL, these cells may function abnormally. Paraneoplastic syndromes include monoclonal gammopathies, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and, rarely, hypercalcemia; 80% of dogs with B-CLL were reported to be hyperglobulinemic and 13% were hypercalcemic.106, 406, 407 In 22 dogs with CLL, 68% had monoclonal gammopathies (usually IgM or IgA).407 The immunophenotypes were not reported in this latter report, but a monoclonal gammopathy would be more likely to occur in B-CLL.",

Careful examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow by an experienced cytopathologist is important in establishing a diagnosis of lymphocytic leukemia; in cases of marked lymphocytosis with atypia, peripheral blood can be used for analysis of immunophenotype and clonality, and examination of bone marrow is not essential. If diagnostic bone marrow cannot be adequately obtained by aspiration, bone marrow core biopsy should be performed. In ALL, large lymphocytes predominate in the bone marrow and are also present in peripheral blood, and other lineages are decreased. In B- and T-cell CLL, lymphocytes are small mature cells that occur in excessive numbers in bone marrow (\u226530% of all nucleated cells) early in the disease.405 In T-CLL, lymphocytes may contain pink granules. Infiltration becomes more extensive as the disease slowly progresses, and eventually the neoplastic cells replace normal marrow.",

Most oncologists recommend active surveillance (monthly or bimonthly physical examination and CBC) over active therapy when CLL is identified incidentally, there are no accompanying clinical signs, and other significant hematologic abnormalities are not identified. If the dog is significantly anemic or thrombocytopenic or is showing evidence of significant lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, therapy should be considered. There is no consensus on what degree of lymphocytosis is used to initiate therapy; the definition of \u201cexcessively high\u201d varies among oncologists, and a standard has not been established in veterinary medicine. The author (DMV) prefers to base treatment decisions on the presence of significant constitutional signs and peripheral cytopenias rather than an absolute lymphocyte count. Currently, the most effective drug available for treatment of CLL, once therapy is deemed necessary, is chlorambucil.400, 405 Chlorambucil is given orally at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg or 6 mg/m2 PO once daily for 7 to 14 days; the dose can then be reduced to 0.1 mg/kg or 3 mg/m2 PO daily. For long-term maintenance, a dose of 2.0 mg/m2 every other day can be used. The dose is adjusted based on clinical response and bone marrow tolerance. Pulse-dose chlorambucil (20\u201330 mg/m2 q 2 weeks) has been anecdotally used for CLL in some cases; however, no compilations of cases have been reported to assess effectiveness of this protocol. Oral prednisone is used concurrently with chlorambucil at doses of 1 mg/kg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then 0.5 mg/kg every other day thereafter. The addition of vincristine or the substitution of cyclophosphamide for chlorambucil has been advocated in animals that do not respond to chlorambucil.",

The decline in FeLV-associated lymphoma is mirrored by a global decline in the overall prevalence per year of FeLV positivity in cats tested.425, 426, 427, 428, 429 Importantly, many of these studies reveal that despite a sharp drop in FeLV-associated lymphoma, the overall prevalence of lymphoma in cats is increasing.

Several studies have documented the potential molecular means by which FeLV can result in lymphoid neoplasia (see Chapter 1, Section C). As one would predict, along with a shift away from FeLV-associated tumors came a shift away from traditional signalment and relative frequency of anatomic sites. This is also supported outside of North America by similar signalment and anatomic frequency data observed in Australia, where FeLV infection is less common, and in Europe, where FeLV incidence has declined and signalment and anatomic site prevalence has shifted accordingly.426, 431, 434, 435 The median age of approximately 11 to 12 years now reported in North America and Europe is considerably higher than the median ages of 3 to 5 years reported in the FeLV era.421, 422, 426, 427, 428, 429, 431 The median age of cats within various anatomic tumor groupings has not changed, and anatomic forms traditionally associated with FeLV, such as the mediastinal form, may still occur in younger, FeLV antigenemic cats. Similarly, the alimentary form and extranodal forms occur most often in older, FeLV-negative cats.436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441\nTable 33.9\npresents an overview of the characteristics of the various anatomic sites of lymphoma in cats. As our ability to interrogate FeLV associations on a molecular basis has improved (e.g., PCR amplification and fluorescent in situ hybridization), several reports exist defining the role or potential role of FeLV in cats with and without FeLV antigenemia.442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447 Collectively, these studies indicate FeLV proviral insertion exists in a proportion of feline lymphoma tissues and is more common in those of T-cell origin, particularly the thymic and peripheral lymph node anatomic forms. They also suggest that several common FeLV integration sites exist.",

Shelton et al determined that FIV infection alone in cats was associated with a five-fold increased risk for development of lymphoma.454 Coinfection with FeLV further potentiates the development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Experimentally, cats infected with FIV have developed lymphoma in the kidney, alimentary tract, liver, and multicentric sites. FIV-associated lymphoma is more likely to be of B-cell immunophenotype, as opposed to the T-cell predominance associated with FeLV. It has been suggested that FIV infection may be associated more commonly with alimentary lymphoma of B-cell origin,449, 457 and this may be related to chronic dysregulation of the immune system or the activation of oncogenic pathways; however, FIV antigenemia was only rarely associated with alimentary lymphoma in other large compilations of cases.428, 458, 459, 460, 461\n",

The interrogation of lymphoma subtypes by flow cytometric analysis, PARR clonality analysis and genetic characterization, as is the standard of practice for human lymphoma and becoming so in canine lymphoma, is less well described and applied in the feline lymphomas, partly due to the prevalence of intrabdominal anatomic forms making sampling more difficult and partly due to variable PCR primer availability and sensitivity.479, 480 The largest compilation of feline cases subjected to rigorous histologic classification was reported by Valli and others using the NCI Working Formulation.481 The WHO has also published a histologic classification system that uses the REAL system as a basis for defining histologic categories of hematopoietic tumors in domestic animals.482, 483 This system incorporates both histologic criteria and immunohistologic criteria (e.g., B- and T-cell immunophenotype) and was discussed in length in Section A of this chapter. The updated Kiel classification system has also been used to classify feline lymphoma.484, 485 Regarding anatomic location, a profound change in presentation, signalment, FeLV antigenemia, immunophenotype, and frequency of anatomic sites has occurred in cats with lymphoma in the \u201cpost-FeLV\u201d era (see Table 33.9). Because of this shift, characteristics of feline lymphoma discussed in this chapter will be primarily limited to reports collected from cases presenting after 1995.",

Others have combined various nodal and extranodal forms into categories of atypical, unclassified, and mixed, and others have combined intestinal, splenic, hepatic, and mesenteric nodal forms into one category termed intraabdominal. Some discrepancies in the discussion of frequency will inevitably result from the variations in classification used in the literature. The relative frequency of anatomic forms and their associated immunophenotype may also vary with geographic distribution and may be related to genetic and FeLV strain differences, as well as prevalence of FeLV vaccine use. For the purposes of this chapter, the feline lymphomas will be discussed in three separate sections: alimentary/gastrointestinal, peripheral nodal, and extranodal. Signalment, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis will be discussed individually under each of these three sections.",

The largest compilation of LGAL (n = 120) classified GI lymphoma based on immunophenotype, then as either mucosal (infiltrate confined to mucosa and lamina propria with minimal submucosal extension) or transmural (significant extension into submucosa and muscularis propria).487 They then compared infiltration patterns with the WHO classification scheme493 as well as documenting anatomic location, cell size, presence of epitheliotropism, clonality, and outcome data. This information is summarized in Table 33.10. Of the 120 cases, none tested serologically positive for FeLV and only three cats tested positive for FIV. Four cats had large B-cell lymphoma (gastric, cecal, or colonic) concurrent with small T-cell lymphoma of the small intestine. Topographically, T-cell variants are much more likely to occur in the small intestine (94%) and rarely in the stomach or large intestine. The majority of T-cell variants are mucosal (equivalent to WHO enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma [WHO EATCL] type II), and the majority of B-cell tumors are transmural (equivalent to WHO EATCL type I classification). Regarding cell size, nearly all mucosal T-cell tumors were composed of small lymphocytes, and slightly more than half of transmural T-cell and all B-cell variants were composed of larger cells. Epitheliotropism is common with LGAL T-cell tumors, but is rare in B-cell tumors. Other abdominal organ involvement is common, and in one report of 29 cases of low-grade T-cell intestinal lymphoma, liver and mesenteric node involvement was documented in 53% and 33% of cases, respectively.494 Hepatic lymphoma can occur concurrently with GI lymphoma or be confined solely to the liver.486, 495 Most are T-cell and clonal or oligoclonal based on PCR analysis.",

Also, thoracic involvement may occur with malignant pleural effusion and a mediastinal mass present.

Most agree that although full thickness biopsies are preferred, less invasive endoscopic biopsies, with ancillary immunophenotypic and molecular (i.e., PARR; see Chapter 8) assessments, are sufficient in the majority of cases (see Table 33.10). If the differentiation of lymphoma and LPE is equivocal after standard histopathologic assessment, the addition of immunophenotypic and clonality analysis in a stepwise fashion, as proposed by several reports, enhances specificity and sensitivity and usually provides a definitive diagnosis.436, 441, 479, 480, 487, 489, 491, 513, 514 As LGAL most commonly involves the jejunum and ilium, endoscopic biopsy by both gastroduodenoscopy and ileocolonoscopy may be necessary to procure representative samples.",

Ultrasonographically, I/HGAL is more likely to involve the stomach and colon than LGAL. In a series of 16 cats with I/HGAL of the stomach, all had either ultrasonic evidence of wall thickening or the presence of a mass, and 20% had abdominal lymphadenopathy.439 Less commonly, abdominal exploration is necessary if lesions are subtle or not amenable to transabdominal sampling. Further staging via thoracic imaging, peripheral lymph node aspiration, and bone marrow assessment may be performed, but rarely contributes prognostic information or alters treatment decisions because the disease is already widespread and systemic therapy is required.",

The agents used most commonly to treat intermediate- or high-grade lymphoma in cats are similar to those used for dogs with lymphoma (see Section A in this chapter), and induction protocols currently employed in cats are modifications of CHOP protocols initially designed for humans.428, 438, 439, 440, 488, 496, 498, 515, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528 CHOP represents combinations of cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H, hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine (O, Oncovin) and prednisone (P). In general, CHOP-based protocols are appropriate for cats with intermediate- and high-grade lymphoma involving any anatomic site (e.g., peripheral nodal, mediastinal, and extranodal forms), but should not be first-line therapy for low-grade variants such as LGAL. As in the dog, a plethora of CHOP-based protocols have been reported for use in cats, although virtually no high-quality comparative data exist to compare outcomes. As such, the protocol used should be based on cost, ease, client/veterinarian preference, and level of comfort. One report found that cats may better tolerate CHOP protocols that substitute vinblastine for vincristine; GI adverse events were less frequent and of lesser grade in cats receiving vinblastine.529 The current CHOP-based protocol in use by the author for cats is presented in Table 33.11\n. This protocol has been used in many cats with various forms of intermediate- and high-grade lymphoma and is generally well tolerated. At present, most canine lymphoma protocols involve a 12- to 25-week induction phase whereupon chemotherapy is discontinued and no maintenance chemotherapy is used. Although data exist in dogs for a maintenance-free approach, similar comparative data do not currently exist in the cat. DOX alone (25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for five total treatments), CCNU (lomustine; 40\u201350 mg/m2 PO q 3 weeks),440 or palliative prednisone therapy is offered if clients decline more aggressive CHOP-based therapy. 440, 530, 531 Cats are generally less tolerant of DOX than are dogs; therefore a lower dosage (25 mg/m2 or 1 mg/kg IV) is used (see Chapter 12). Cardiac toxicity does not appear to be a clinically significant problem in cats, although renal toxicity is more commonly encountered,532 and renal function should be monitored (i.e., serial blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, and urine specific gravity) closely before and during therapy. The use of COP (i.e., CHOP without the addition of DOX) is often used in cats in Europe, and one compilation reported similar results to CHOP.533 A COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone) protocol commonly employed in cats is presented in Table 33.12\n; however, several studies have reported that the inclusion of DOX is important for predicting more durable responses. 488, 527, 534 The use of intraperitoneal-delivered COP in a small number of cats (n = 26) was reported; three-quarters achieved a CR with a MST of 1 year.535 This study included only three GI cases and did not histologically or immunophenotypically subtype cases beyond saying all were \u201clarge cell\u201d; therefore larger, more controlled studies would be necessary to establish/confirm efficacy of this protocol.",

            "text": "Surgery is primarily reserved for I/HGAL that have discrete lesions and in cats that are presented with intestinal perforation and obstructive lesions.439, 488, 496 Of current debate is whether surgery should be performed on discrete lesions that are not perforated or obstructed before initiating systemic chemotherapy. This question is currently unanswered as comparative trials have not clearly established a benefit or detriment to this approach. The motivation behind performing surgery before chemotherapy often lies with concern for GI perforation resulting from robust chemotherapy response in cases with full-thickness involvement with lymphoma. Crouse reported on 23 cats with discrete I/HGAL undergoing chemotherapy without surgery. Although four cats (17%) experienced perforation, these events occurred 2 to 87 days after initiation of chemotherapy rather than in the acute postchemotherapy period, they were not associated with size or degree of hypoalbuminemia, and progressive disease was documented in three cats and only a partial response in the other cat at the time of perforation.437 Taken together, this implies that perforations were likely due to progressive disease rather than robust response to chemotherapy. An additional motivation for surgical intervention is the theoretical advantage of immediate creation of a \u201cminimal residual disease\u201d state if staging does not reveal disease distant from a large GI primary tumor; chemotherapy is generally thought to result in more favorable outcomes in the minimal disease state, rather than in the macroscopic disease state. The author generally recommends surgery, albeit in the absence of convincing support in the literature, if lesions are large, discrete, and no (or minimal) involvement is documented outside the primary mass after complete staging. Multiagent chemotherapy is then initiated at suture removal owing to the high-grade nature and overall short STs associated with I/HGAL.",

Pleural effusion is observed in 50% of cases and characterized by serohemorrhagic to chylous effusion and, in most cases, neoplastic cells (lymphoblasts) are identified.546, 548, 550 Diagnostic suspicion may begin with a noncompressible cranial thorax on physical examination and confirmation of a mediastinal mass/pleural effusion on thoracic radiographs. Fine-needle aspirate (FNA) cytology of the mass or cytologic evaluation of pleural fluid may be sufficient to establish a diagnosis. In most cats, the finding of a monotonous population of intermediate or large lymphoid cells will establish a diagnosis; however, definitive diagnosis of lymphoma in cats with a mediastinal mass and concurrent chylothorax can be challenging. CT appearance may be helpful, but generally does not contribute to a definitive diagnosis. If large lymphocytes are not identified in the pleural chylous effusion, then cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations can be measured.551 In chylous effusions, the pleural fluid triglyceride concentration will be greater than in the serum; however, anorectic cats may have lower triglyceride levels in the pleural fluid. A major differential for mediastinal lymphoma is thymoma. The cytologic features of thymoma can be distinct from lymphoma in many cases, but the diagnosis can be challenging because of a preponderance of small lymphocytes in thymoma. Mast cells can also be seen in up to 50% of aspirations from thymomas. The addition of immunophenotypic and clonality assessment may be helpful in equivocal cases.",

Thorough staging (i.e., regional node assessment, thoracic and abdominal staging, and bone marrow assessment) to ensure the disease is confined to the nasal passages is recommended if local RT without systemic chemotherapy is being considered.

Approximately 75% of affected cats go on to die of their lymphoma; therefore SC-L should be considered to have an aggressive biologic behavior. In the largest report, median progression-free and overall STs after primary site surgical removal were 101 days and 148 days respectively.431 In the case of tarsal SC-L, even with hindlimb amputation in three cats, regional nodal or distant involvement was documented in all cases (at 56, 350, and 525 days), albeit durable disease-free intervals were observed in two cats. In a limited number of cats treated with RT, responses were brisk, but some progressed beyond the radiation field. The efficacy of chemotherapy is currently not well known; in a small number of cases receiving a variety of chemotherapy protocols, although many responded or stabilized, durability was poor and MSTs were approximately 6 months.592 Seven cases of tarsal SC-L received chemotherapy and RT with an MST of 216 days. Because the disease has a high recurrence and metastatic behavior, it is likely that a multimodality approach involving local therapy (surgery and/or RT) and systemic chemotherapy would intuitively provide the best outcomes.",

These disorders have been classified based on biologic behavior, degree of cellular differentiation, and lineage of the neoplastic cells (granulocytic, monocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, or mixed). Newer classification systems in humans have incorporated genetics and molecular genetic analysis; these are currently areas of active investigation in the study of animal MPDs.614 In 1991, the Animal Leukemia Study Group made recommendations for classifying nonlymphoid leukemias in dogs and cats.615 More recently, the Oncology Committee of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP) has been reexamining criteria for a classification system and spearheading large multiinstitutional studies to validate the criteria. Long-term objectives of these studies are to define molecular lesions, establish prognostic markers, and identify effective therapeutic approaches.616 See Box 33.6\n.BOX 33.6Key Clinical Summary Points: Myeloid Leukemia, Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, and Myelodysplasia\n\u2022Myeloid leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders are rare neoplastic diseases of bone marrow in which there are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells (Table 33.13).\u2022Clonal disorders of bone marrow include myeloaplasia (usually referred to as aplastic anemia), myelodysplasia, and myeloproliferation.\n\u2022The terms acute and chronic refer to the degree of cellular differentiation of the leukemic cells, but these terms also correlate with the biologic behavior of the neoplasm.\u2022The acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are aggressive leukemias that progress rapidly, are poorly responsive to treatment, and are associated with short survival times (typically <2 months).\u2022In AML, determination of the leukemic lineage (i.e., neutrophilic, monocytic, erythroid, or megakaryocytic origin) requires advanced diagnostic testing (cytochemical staining, flow cytometric analysis, clonality testing, or genetic analysis).\u2022\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), previously termed chronic myeloproliferative disorders, are characterized by excessive production of differentiated bone marrow cells, resulting in the accumulation of erythrocytes (polycythemia vera), granulocytes and/or monocytes (chronic myelogenous leukemia and its variants), or platelets (essential thrombocythemia).\u2022Because of the degree of differentiation of cells in MPNs, these disorders must be distinguished from nonneoplastic causes of increases in these cell types.\u2022Compared with AMLs, MPNs and myelodysplasias have a more chronic course and may have better responses to therapy, although most will progress and ultimately result in mortality.\n",

The myeloid compartment depends on a group of factors, collectively referred to as colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). These factors act at the level of the committed progenitor cells, but also influence the functional capabilities of mature cells. Some of these factors have a broad spectrum of activity; others are more restricted in their target cells and actions. CSFs are produced in vitro by a multitude of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells, and these cells likely play a role in the production and regulation of these factors in vivo.

In 1991 this group proposed a classification system following adaptation of the FAB system and criteria established by the NCI Workshop.615 Group members examined blood and bone marrow from 49 dogs and cats with myeloid neoplasms. Romanowsky-stained specimens were examined first to identify blast cells and their percentages. Lineage specificity was then determined using cytochemical markers. The percentage of blasts and the information about lineage specificity were used in combination to classify disorders as acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL), AML (subtypes M1\u2013M5 and M7), and erythroleukemia with or without erythroid predominance (M6 and M6Er).

In addition, in the absence of cytochemical staining, immunophenotyping, or electron microscopic evaluation, the specific subtype of leukemia has often been uncertain, making retrospective analysis of epidemiologic information, prognosis, and response to therapy confusing at best. Although defining specific subtypes may seem to be an academic exercise owing to the uniformly poor prognosis of acute leukemias, this information is critical to improving their management. Because of the low incidence of AML, national and international cooperative efforts will be required to accumulate information on the pathogenesis and response to different treatment modalities of specific subtypes. Utilization of a uniform classification system is an essential first step. Different forms of AML are demonstrated in Fig. 33.21. With the exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia or M3, all AML subtypes have been described in dogs. Combining three recent compilations of 85 dogs with AML, the relative frequency of subtypes in decreasing order were: 42% monocytic leukemia (M5a, M5b), 33% myelomonocytic leukemia (M4), 13% myeloblastic leukemia without differentiation (M1), 5% megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7), and one each of myeloblastic leukemia with some differentiation (M2) and erythroleukemia (M6).619, 620, 621 AML of mixed lineages comprised 5% of cases. Many single case or small case series reports also exist describing various subtypes in dogs.617, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671 Monocytic leukemias have likely included those with and without monocytic differentiation (M5a and M5b),672, 673 but in some cases the diagnosis may have been chronic myelomonocytic or chronic monocytic leukemia. There are few reports in dogs of spontaneously occurring erythroleukemia (M6) in which the leukemic cells include myeloblasts, monoblasts, and erythroid elements.674, 675, 676 AULs have uncertain lineages because they are negative for all cytochemical markers. These leukemias should be distinguished from lymphoid leukemias by flow cytometric analysis of the leukemic cells for cellular antigens that identify their lineage.620, 677 In addition, examination of blast cells by electron microscopy may reveal characteristic ultrastructural features.",

The disease has been reported in dogs that tend to be middle-aged with no breed or sex predilection682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692 and is characterized by an increased RBC mass evidenced by an increased packed cell volume (PCV), RBC count, and hemoglobin concentration. The PCV is typically in the range of 65% to 85%. The bone marrow is hyperplastic, although the myeloid-to-erythroid (M:E) ratio tends to be normal. In contrast to the disease in humans, other cell lines do not appear to be involved and transformation to other MPNs has not been reported. The disease in dogs may be more appropriately termed primary erythrocytosis. In humans, progenitor cells have an increased sensitivity to insulin-like growth factor 1, which stimulates hematopoiesis.691 It is not known whether this hypersensitivity is the primary defect or is secondary to another gene mutation. In any case, the result is overproduction of red blood cells (RBCs). Acquired JAK2 gene mutations are identified in 90% of humans with PV, and an identical mutation in the JAK2 gene of 1 of 5 dogs with PV was reported.681\n",

CML can occur in dogs of any age.693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 698 Neutrophils and neutrophilic precursors accumulate in bone marrow and peripheral blood as well as in other organs. The peripheral WBC count is usually, but not always, greater than 100,000/\u03bcL. Both immature and mature neutrophils are present (see Fig. 33.21F). Mature forms are usually more numerous, but sometimes an \u201cuneven\u201d left shift is present. Signs of dysplasia may be evident, including hypersegmentation, ringed nuclei, and giant forms. Eosinophils and basophils may also be increased. The bone marrow is characterized by granulocytic hyperplasia and morphologic abnormalities may not be present. Erythroid and megakaryocytic lines may be affected, resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia, or less commonly, thrombocytosis. This disorder must be distinguished from severe or extreme neutrophilic leukocytosis (\u201cleukemoid reactions\u201d) caused by inflammation or immune-mediated diseases. Extreme neutrophilia can also occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome. In humans with CML, characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities are present in all bone marrow cells, signifying a lesion at the level of an early multipotent stem cell. Typically, these individuals have a chromosomal translocation, resulting in the Philadelphia chromosome or BCR\u2013ABL translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.699 The analogous chromosomes in dogs are chromosomes 9 and 26, and BCR\u2013ABL translocation, termed the \u201cRaleigh chromosome,\u201d has been reported in several cases of CML in dogs.614, 627, 700, 701 Variants of CML are chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and chronic monocytic leukemia (CMoL).702, 703, 704 CMoL has also been associated with BCR\u2013ABL translocation in the dog.702 These diagnoses are made based on the percentage of monocytes in the leukemic cell population. An infrequent myeloproliferative neoplasm, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, has been reported in a dog and had features of both myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic leukemia.700 In this dog, BCR\u2013ABL translocation was present in fewer than 10% of cells, considered a negative finding.",

There are no blast cells in circulation and marked megakaryocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow without myelofibrosis is present. Thrombosis and bleeding are the most common sequelae, and most patients have splenomegaly. Other MPDs, especially PV, should be ruled out, and importantly, there should be no primary disorders associated with reactive thrombocytosis,710 including inflammation, hemolytic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, malignancies, recovery from severe hemorrhage, rebound from immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and splenectomy. In addition, certain drugs such as vincristine can induce thrombocytosis. ET has been recognized in dogs.642, 711, 712, 713, 714 In one dog, the platelet count exceeded 4 million/\u03bcL and bizarre giant forms with abnormal granulation were present. The bone marrow contained increased numbers of megakaryocytes and megakaryoblasts, but circulating blast cells were not seen. Other findings included splenomegaly, GI bleeding, and increased numbers of circulating basophils. Causes of secondary or reactive thrombocytosis were ruled out.713 Basophilia was also reported in a more recent case.711 In another dog, ET was diagnosed and then progressed to CML.642 In some cases reported in the literature as ET, the dogs had microcytic hypochromic anemias. Because iron deficiency anemia is associated with reactive or secondary thrombocytosis, care must be taken to rule out this disorder. However, spurious microcytosis may be reported if a dog has many giant platelets that are counted by some analyzers as small RBCs.712 Microscopic review of the blood film may be helpful in these cases.",

In dogs, in which the syndrome is rare, there usually are cytopenias in two or three lines in the peripheral blood (anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia). Other blood abnormalities can include macrocytic erythrocytes and metarubricytosis. The bone marrow is typically normocellular or hypercellular, and dysplastic changes are evident in several cell lines. If blast cells are present, they make up fewer than 30% of all nucleated cells,614 although this threshold is being changed to less than 20%.616, 722 Myelodysplasia is sometimes referred to as preleukemia because, in some cases, it may progress to acute leukemia.639, 640, 641 Based on reported cases, poor prognostic factors include increased percentage of blast cells, cytopenias involving more than one lineage, and cellular atypia.616 Primary MDSs are clonal disorders and are considered neoplastic. Complex classification schemes for human MDS, based on percentages of blasts in bone marrow, cytogenetic analysis, cytopenias, need for transfusions, and other variables, comprise at least nine subtypes; their applicability to veterinary medicine is unknown.617 Three subtypes are proposed for dogs and cats and include MDS with excessive blasts (MDS-EB), in which blast percentages are greater than 5% and less than 20%, and progression to AML may occur; MDS with refractory cytopenia (MDS-RC) with blast percentages less than 5% and cytopenias in one or more lineages; and MDS with erythroid predominance (MDS-ER) in which the M:E ratio is less than one and prognosis is poor.616 Larger studies are needed to determine the utility of this classification scheme and other potential prognostic factors, such as sex and age and, in cats, FeLV positivity. In addition to accumulating enough cases, another confounding factor to studying and classifying MDS is the presence of reversible MDSs that occur secondary to immune-mediated, infectious, and other diseases in both dogs and cats.",

Low numbers of nucleated RBCs are present in the blood of about half the dogs with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Nonregenerative anemia and thrombocytopenia are present in most cases. Anemia is usually normocytic and normochromic, although macrocytic anemia is sometimes present. Pathogenic mechanisms include effects of inhibitory factors leading to ineffective hematopoiesis, myelophthisis, immune-mediated anemia secondary to neoplasia, and hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Anemia is most severe in AML, although both anemia and thrombocytopenia may be milder in animals with the M5 subtype (acute monocytic leukemia). In myelofibrosis, anemia is characterized by anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. In addition, pancytopenia and leukoerythroblastosis, in which immature erythroid and myeloid cells are in circulation, may be present. These phenomena probably result from replacement of marrow by fibrous tissue with resultant shearing of red cells and escape of immature cells normally confined to bone marrow.

In bone marrow, blast cells are calculated both as a percentage of all nucleated cells (ANC) and nonerythroid cells, and are further characterized using cytochemical markers.724, 725, 727 Neutrophil differentiation is identified by positive staining of blasts for peroxidase, Sudan Black B, and chloracetate esterase. Nonspecific esterases (\u03b1-naphthyl acetate esterase or \u03b1-naphthyl butyrate esterase), especially if they are inhibited by sodium fluoride, mark monocytes. Canine monocytes may also contain a few peroxidase-positive granules. Acetylcholinesterase is a marker for megakaryocytes in dogs and cats. In addition, positive immunostaining for von Willebrand\u2019s factor (factor VIII\u2013related antigen) and platelet glycoproteins on the surface of blasts identifies them as megakaryocyte precursors.648, 658, 659, 661, 665, 667 Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) only rarely marks normal cells in dogs and cats, but is present in blasts cells in acute myeloblastic and myelomonocytic leukemias. However, owing to reports of ALP activity in lymphoid leukemias in dogs, its specificity as a marker for myeloid cells is not certain. A recent study indicated that ALP was a useful marker for the diagnosis of AML if neoplastic cells express only CD34.728 Omega exonuclease is a specific marker for basophils, which are also positive for chloracetate esterase activity.707\n",

Cells can be immunophenotyped using flow cytometric analysis or immunocytochemistry.618, 619, 620, 621, 671, 677, 722, 729, 730, 731, 732 Cells from both acute lymphoid leukemia and AML are positive for CD34. Many lymphocyte markers, including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD21, CD79, and IgG, are available for dogs and can be used to rule out lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs with acute leukemias. Other markers include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD11b for myeloid cells and CD41 for megakaryoblasts. There is some overlap in expression of these cellular antigens. For example, canine (but not human) granulocytes express CD4. It is highly recommended to use a panel of antibodies (similar to using a battery of cytochemical stains) because antigens are often expressed on multiple lineages, and lineage infidelity can occur. These tests have become more valuable with the availability of canine reagents. Currently, the ACVP Oncology Committee recommends that the following immunophenotyping panel be done on bone marrow and/or blood smears to characterize animal leukemias: for B lymphocytes, CD79a; for T lymphocytes, CD3; for myeloid cells, MPO and CD11b; for megakaryoblasts, CD41; for dendritic cells, CD1c; and for acute leukemias, CD34.632 In 2 large reports of 60 cases of AML in dogs, most were CD45/CD18/CD34 positive and, in one report, 64% had clonal or biclonal rearrangements of either the T- or B-cell receptor.619, 621\n",

To make a diagnosis of PV, it must first be established that the polycythemia is absolute rather than relative. In relative polycythemias, plasma volume is decreased from hemoconcentration, dehydration, or hypovolemia, and the absolute RBC mass is not increased. Splenic contraction can also result in relative polycythemia. Absolute polycythemia, in which RBC mass is increased, is usually secondary to tissue hypoxia, causing appropriately increased production of erythropoietin. Rarely, erythropoietin may be produced inappropriately by a tumor (e.g., renal cell carcinoma) or in renal disease (pyelonephritis) or localized renal hypoxia.733, 734, 735 These causes of polycythemia should be eliminated by appropriate laboratory work, thoracic radiographs, arterial blood gas analysis, and renal ultrasonography. In humans with PV, plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations are low. EPO concentrations in dogs with PV tend to be low or low-normal, whereas in animals with secondary absolute polycythemia, the levels are high.736, 737 Samples for determination of EPO concentrations should be taken before therapeutic phlebotomy used to treat hyperviscosity and, owing to fluctuations in EPO concentrations, should be repeated if results are incongruous with other information.",

In CML, maturation sometimes appears disorderly, and there may be variation in the size and shape of neutrophils at the same level of maturation. In addition, neoplastic leukocytes may disintegrate more rapidly and appear vacuolated.697 Because of the invasive nature of CML, biopsy of liver or spleen may also help distinguish true leukemia from a leukemoid reaction, assuming the animal can tolerate the procedure. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis is available to identify chromosomal rearrangements, including translocations (e.g., Raleigh chromosome), inversions, and deletions, in dogs; some of these aberrations are associated with certain forms of leukemia, and continued investigations will likely yield a larger database of cytogenetic abnormalities and their links to hematologic malignancies.614, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 678, 679, 681, 699, 700, 701, 702\n",

The rationale for use of EPO was to promote terminal differentiation of dysplastic erythrocytes. Human recombinant EPO should be used with caution in animals, as anti-EPO antibodies may be induced and target endogenous EPO. The PCV increased from 12% to 34% by day 19 of EPO treatment. This dog remained in remission for more than 30 months.638 Other factors that induce differentiation of hematopoietic cells include retinoic acid analogs, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, interferon-\u03b1, and conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as 6-thioguanine and Ara-C.754, 755, 756 The propensity of these factors to enhance progression to leukemia is not known in many cases, but the potential risk exists.",

            "text": "Myeloma-related disorders (MRDs) arise when a cell of the plasma cell or immunoglobulin-producing B-lymphocyte precursor lineage transforms and proliferates to form a clonal neoplastic population of similar cells. This population is believed in most instances to be monoclonal (i.e., derived from a single cell) because they typically produce homogeneous immunoglobulin, although some examples of biclonal and polyclonal MRD neoplasms exist. A wide variety of clinical syndromes are represented by MRDs, including multiple myeloma (MM), extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP [both cutaneous and noncutaneous]), IgM (Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s) macroglobulinemia, solitary osseous plasmacytoma (SOP), and Ig-secreting lymphomas and leukemias (including plasma cell leukemia). MM is the most important MRD based on clinical incidence and severity. There appears to be some discordance and blurring of the distinction between MM and multicentric noncutaneous EMP in cats and these two MRDs will be discussed together in this species. See Box 33.7\n.BOX 33.7Key Clinical Summary Points: Myeloma-Related Disorders\n\u2022Myeloma-related disorders (MRDs) represent clonal neoplastic populations of plasma cells.\u2022They include multiple myeloma (MM), extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP), (Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s) macroglobulinemia, solitary osseous plasmacytoma (SOP), and plasma cell leukemia.\u2022Dogs and cats with MM are presented with a wide variety of clinical signs (TABLE 33.14, TABLE 33.15) and clinicopathologic abnormalities (Table 33.16) resulting from high levels of circulating M component, organ or bone infiltration with neoplastic cells, or both.\u2022Diagnosis of MM usually follows the demonstration of bone marrow or visceral organ plasmacytosis (Fig. 33.23), the presence of osteolytic bone lesions (Fig. 33.25, Fig. 33.26), and the demonstration of serum or urine myeloma proteins (M component; Fig. 33.24).\u2022Most (>80%) dogs with MM respond to chemotherapy (melphalan/prednisone) and enjoy durable remissions, with median survival times of 1.5 to 2.5 years. Most (50%\u201380%) cats also respond to chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide/prednisolone) although the durability of response tends to be shorter, with median survival times reported from 4 to 13 months\u2022Cutaneous and oral solitary EMPs are usually cured after surgical excision.\u2022Cutaneous plasmacytosis, however, is associated with multiple lesions (10s to 100s), is a biologically aggressive disease, with treatment and outcomes more like those for MM.\u2022Noncutaneous/nonoral EMPs and SOPs can be initially confined to local sites and respond to local therapy (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy); however, frequent rechecks are necessary, because many will eventually progress systemically.\n",

            "text": "MM is a systemic proliferation of malignant plasma cells or their precursors arising as a clone of a single cell that usually involves multiple bone marrow sites in dogs. In cats, as previously stated, a blurring of the distinction of MM and multicentric noncutaneous EMP within the MRD occurs because widespread abdominal organ involvement without significant bone marrow infiltration has been described in a proportion of cases in European compilations.771, 786 Because both MM and multicentric noncutaneous EMP have a similar clinical course and widespread systemic involvement with hyperglobulinemia in cats, they will be discussed as MM in this chapter. Malignant plasma cells can have a varied appearance on histologic sections and cytologic preparations. The degree of differentiation ranges from those resembling normal plasma cells in late stages of differentiation (Fig. 33.23\n) to very large anaplastic round cells (often referred to as plasmablasts) with a high mitotic index representing early stages of differentiation.763, 764, 767, 786 Binucleate and multinucleate cells are often present (see Fig. 7.32, Chapter 7). In 16 cats with MM in one case series,787 the majority (83%) of plasma cells were immature and had marked atypia, including increased size, multiple nuclei, clefted nuclei, anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, variable nuclear: cytoplasmic ratios, decreased chromatin density, and variable nucleoli; nearly one quarter had \u201cflame cell\u201d morphology characterized by peripheral eosinophilic cytoplasmic processes.767 However, in a European compilation of feline multicentric noncutaneous MRD cases (n = 17), 78% had well-differentiated morphologies.786 The authors of this latter case series developed a grading system dependent on the percentage of plasmablasts within the neoplastic cells in which well-differentiated, intermediate-grade, and poorly differentiated MMs have less than 15%, 15% to 49%, and 50% or more plasmablasts, respectively.786 Malignant plasma cells typically produce an overabundance of a single type of or component of immunoglobulin, which is referred to as the M component\n(Fig. 33.24\n). The M component can be represented by any class of the entire immunoglobulin or only a portion of the molecule, such as the light chain (Bence Jones protein) or heavy chain (heavy chain disease) of the molecule. In the dog, the M component is usually represented by either IgA or IgG immunoglobulin types in nearly equal incidence, whereas the ratio of IgGtoIgA in cats is approximately 5:1 in some reports and approximately 1:1 in others.757, 763, 764, 765, 766, 767, 786, 788 However, in two recent compilations of dogs with MM, including 27 dogs in which the immunoglobulin was typed, the vast majority (78%) were of the IgA type.761, 762 If the M component is the IgM type, the term macroglobulinemia (Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s) is often applied. Several cases of biclonal gammopathy in dogs and cats have been reported,761, 767, 770, 771, 789, 790, 791, 792, 793, 794, 795 and several cases of nonsecretory MM have been reported in dogs.762, 796, 797, 798 Rarely, cryoglobulinemia occurs in dogs with MM and IgM macroglobulinemia, and this has also been reported in a cat with IgG myeloma.764, 799, 800, 801 Cryoglobulins are paraproteins that are insoluble at temperatures below 37\u00b0C and require blood collection and clotting to be performed at 37\u00b0C before serum separation. If whole blood is allowed to clot at temperatures below this, the protein precipitates in the clot and is lost. Pure light-chain M component is rare, but has been reported in both dogs and cats.762, 802, 803\n",

The magnitude of viscosity changes is related to the type, size, shape, and concentration of the M component in the blood. HVS is more common with IgM macroglobulinemia because of the high molecular weight of this class of immunoglobulin. IgA-secreting myelomas (IgA is usually present as a dimer in the dog) may undergo polymerization resulting in increased serum viscosity.757, 764, 808 IgG-associated HVS can also occur, albeit less frequently. High serum viscosity occurs in approximately 20% to 40% of dogs with MM and can result in bleeding diathesis, neurologic signs (e.g., dementia, depression, seizure activity, coma), ophthalmic abnormalities (e.g., dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, retinal hemorrhage [Fig. 33.27\n], retinal detachment), and increased cardiac workload with the potential for subsequent development of cardiomyopathy.757, 761, 764, 804, 805, 808, 809, 810, 811 In a retrospective compilation of 83 dogs with retinal hemorrhage, 5% were due to MM.812 These consequences of HVS are thought to be a result of sludging of blood in small vessels, ineffective delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and coagulation abnormalities. HVS has been reported in cats with IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-secreting tumors.764, 765, 813, 814, 815, 816, 817, 818 In several of these cases, relative serum viscosity was increased above control ranges.",

In the case of MM, an unbalanced excess of light-chain products may be produced. Light chains are of low molecular weight and are normally filtered by the renal glomerulus, and their presence in urine can result in protein precipitates and subsequent renal tubular injury. The presence of light chains in urine without a concomitant monoclonal spike in serum, although rare, is indicative of pure light-chain disease.802 Tubules become obstructed by large laminated casts containing albumin, immunoglobulin, and light chains. Bence Jones proteinuria occurs in approximately 25% to 40% of dogs with MM.757, 763, 764 Bence Jones proteinuria is reported to occur in approximately 40% of cats with MM/MRD.767, 768 Hypercalcemia is reported in 15% to 50% of dogs with MM and is thought to result primarily from the production of osteoclast-activating factor by neoplastic cells.757, 761, 762, 764, 819 Other factors, including increased levels of various cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6, have been implicated in human MM. In two dogs with MM and hypercalcemia, serum elevations in circulating N-terminal parathyroid hormone-related peptide were noted.820 Hypercalcemia may also be exacerbated by associated renal disease. Hypercalcemia, initially thought to be a rare event in cats with MM, occurred in 10% to 25% of recently reported cases.767, 769, 770, 771, 821\n",

Molecular diagnostic techniques for MM have received limited use thus far in veterinary oncology; however, determining clonality of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene has been performed in feline and canine plasmacytoma and myeloma using PARR techniques (see Chapter 8),762, 834 and use of this technology in cases where diagnosis is not straightforward is expanding. The author has used PARR analysis both before treatment and after clinical remission in a small number of dogs with MM involved in clinical trials and documented its utility for (1) initial diagnosis and (2) to characterize molecular remission.762\n",

Occasionally, bony lesions can be observed in skeletal areas on these standard films, and organomegaly (liver, spleen, kidney) is observed in the majority of cats.767, 769, 771 Abdominal ultrasound is recommended in all cats suspected of MM because this modality reveals involvement of one or more abdominal organs in the majority of cases. These include splenomegaly with or without nodules, diffuse hyperechoic hepatomegaly with or without nodules, renomegaly, and iliac lymph node enlargement. In one case series in cats with MM, 85% of organs with ultrasonographic abnormalities were subsequently confirmed to have plasma cell infiltration.771 Skeletal survey radiographs are recommended to determine presence and extent of osteolytic lesions, which may have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. Although nuclear scintigraphy (bone scan) for clinical staging of dogs with MM has been performed, because of the predominant osteolytic activity with osteoblastic inactivity present, scans seldom give positive results and are therefore not useful for routine diagnosis.835 In physician-based oncology, bone mineral density analysis (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scan) to document osteoporosis, MRI of bone marrow, and PET/CT are commonly used for staging; however, these modalities have not been applied consistently in the veterinary literature. A clinical staging system for canine MM has been suggested757; however, at present, no prognostic significance has been attributed to it.\n",

This protocol also has the advantage of requiring the caregiver to administer fewer treatments with less overall exposure to chemotherapy during delivery and in body fluids.

Melphalan is continued indefinitely until clinical relapse occurs or myelosuppression necessitates a dose reduction or discontinuation. The vast majority of dogs on melphalan and prednisone combination therapy tolerate the regimen well. The most clinically significant toxicity of melphalan is myelosuppression, in particular a delayed thrombocytopenia which can be slow to recover and in some cases irreversible. CBCs, including platelet counts, should be performed biweekly for 2 months of therapy and monthly thereafter in dogs on continuous protocols and just before pulse-dose when using the alternate protocol. If significant myelosuppression occurs (usually thrombocytopenia or neutropenia), a drug holiday is instituted with reintroduction at a lesser dose after marrow recovery.

Several, albeit rare, instances of monoclonal gammopathy or plasma cell leukemia have been reported in dogs with cutaneous plasmacytoma, cutaneous plasmacytosis and gastrointestinal EMP.850, 874, 890, 891 Staging is likely most important in cases of cutaneous plasmacytosis, SOP, and GI EMP due to their relatively high metastatic rate, but is less important for cutaneous, oral, and colorectal plasmacytomas because of their more typical benign behavior. Cutaneous plasmacytosis was associated with lymph node or abdominal viscera involvement in approximately 30% of cases; however, no cases in a large compilation had positive bone marrow aspirates and only one dog had a monoclonal gammopathy.850 For GI EMP (including colorectal EMP), endoscopic evaluation of the entire GI tract is recommended. A single case report of the use of PET/CT imaging for extramedullary splenic plasmacytoma in a dog exists; however, its utility remains unknown.892\n",

RT has been used infrequently for cases that are not surgical candidates, including the application of strontium-90 plesiotherapy for lingual plasmacytoma in a dog.894 Surgery is recommended, in combination with RT, for those cases of SOP in which the lesion results in an unstable, long bone fracture (see Fig. 33.25), or the patient is nonambulatory from neurologic compromise resulting from a vertebral body SOP. In the latter case, spinal cord decompression, mass excision, and possibly spinal stabilization may be necessary.829 RT can be used alone (i.e., without surgery) in those cases where fractures are stable, as a palliative measure for bone pain, or in the case of vertebral SOP if the patient is ambulatory and stable. Good local control is usually achieved; however, most progress to systemic MM.797, 828, 881 SOP of the axial skeleton can be managed by excision or RT alone. There is controversy as to whether systemic chemotherapy should be initiated at the time of local therapy for SOP when systemic involvement is not documented. Systemic spread may not occur for many months to even years beyond primary SOP diagnosis in humans and dogs, and studies in humans reveal no benefit to initiating systemic chemotherapy before progression to systemic disease.807, 828 Two cases of SOP in cats were recently reported; one was treated with external-beam RT and one managed with melphalan chemotherapy and both enjoyed durable remissions of greater than 4 years.895 Similarly, EMP of the GI tract in humans are treated most commonly by surgical excision and thorough staging of disease. Systemic therapy is not initiated unless systemic involvement is documented. Systemic chemotherapy has been used after gastric EMP in a cat; however, the utility of adjuvant therapy in the species is unknown.896\n",
