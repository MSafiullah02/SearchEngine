Studies on the mechanism of action of these anti-HIV-1 peptides provided important information to elucidate the fusogenic mechanism mediated by HIV-1 gp41.17, 18, 19 After binding of gp120 to CD4 and a coreceptor, gp41 changes conformation via HR1 and HR2 interaction to form a fusogenic hexameric core structure, which brings the viral and target-cell membranes into close proximity, resulting in fusion between them. At the intermediate state, a C-peptide can bind the viral gp41 HR1 region and block formation of the six-helix bundle, thus inhibiting virus fusion with the target cell.20 The discovery of these HIV-1 fusion-inhibitory peptides launched a new line of investigation of viral fusogenic mechanisms and identification of antiviral peptides against infection by many other enveloped viruses\u2014simian21 and feline22 immunodefi-ciency viruses, Ebola virus,23 Newcastle disease virus,24 and respiratory syncytial virus.25\n",

            "text": "We analysed the spike protein of SARS-CoV strain Tor25 by a PredictProtein program.37 The protein consists of an extracellular domain (aminoacid residues 1\u20131199), a transmembrane domain (residues 1200\u20131215), and an intracellular domain (residues 1216\u20131255). A signal peptide (residues 1\u201313) at the amino-terminus was observed, but no obvious fusogenic peptide sequence was identified. The spike proteins of most coronaviruses (except porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus) are cleavable by cellular proteases to yield S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (virus fusion) subunits.9, 10, 12, 38 SARS-CoV spike protein does not contain a typical cleavage site (a basic aminoacid sequence\u2014eg, RRFRR, GRHRR, KRRSRR).9 Therefore, the boundary between the S1 and S2 domains cannot be accurately identified at present. As in other coronavirus spike proteins, the S2 domain has a more conserved sequence than the S1 domain. The latter is a compact globular structure as predicted by the PredictProtein program Globe for prediction of globularity. The S2 domain contains HR1 (residues 892\u20131013) and HR2 (residues 1145\u20131194), similar to other class I viral fusion proteins.9, 13, 39 Analysis by the MultiCoil program31 showed that the sequences in the HR1 and HR2 regions have a tendency to form trimeric or dimeric helix bundles, consistent with the observation that coronavirus spike proteins are homotrimers or homodimers.9 Thus, these regions may take part in the oligomerisation and conformational changes of spike protein during virus\u2013cell fusion events. The spike protein of SARS-CoV has only about 24% pairwise aminoacid identity with the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses, consistent with the observation by Rota and colleagues.6 However, the identity of their HR1 and HR2 sequences is much higher (table 2\n), which suggests that the sequences in the HR1 and HR2 regions are more conserved than other sequences in spike protein. Alignments of the peptides derived from the HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein and the HIV-1 gp41 revealed high sequence similarity between HIV-1 N-peptide N36 and SARS-CoV N-peptide NP-1 and between HIV-1 C-peptide C43 and SARS-CoV C-peptide CP-1 (45% and 51%, respectively; figure 1). Thus, the HR1 and HR2 regions in SARS-CoV spike protein and HIV-1 gp41 may share certain structural and functional features.",

Other peptides did not show inhibitory activity at 50 \u03bcmol/L (data not shown), which suggests that CP-1, perhaps like the HIV-1 gp41 C-peptides, interacts with a site in the HR1 region and interferes with the conformational change of the spike protein during the viral fusion process. To identify the CP-1 binding site in HR1, we immobilised biotinylated CP-1 on streptavidin sensor chips and searched for the CP-1-binding peptides from HR1 region, as determined by surface plasmon resonance with BIACORE. CP-1 strongly bound to NP-1 with a high binding affinity or kinetic dissociation constant (1\u00b762\u00d710\u22128 mol/L; figure 2), whereas other peptides derived from the HR1 region had very low or no binding activity to CP-1 (data not shown).

With the exception of NP-3, N-peptides showed no bands in the gel (figure 4\n) because they carried net positive charges under the native electrophoresis conditions (table 1) and could therefore have migrated up and off the gel. NP-3 did migrate down in the gel because it has net zero charge, but it showed two bands, perhaps because it has differing conformations. Peptide CP-1 showed a band in the lower part of the gel. The mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed two bands: the lower one had the same position as isolated CP-1, and the upper one is expected to be a higher order of oligomeric complex formed by NP-1 and CP-1. To confirm whether this band indeed represents a complex formed between NP-1 and CP-1, we analysed the mixture of NP-1 and biotinylated CP-1 at different ratios by N-PAGE in two gels. One was stained with Coomassie blue (figure 4, middle gel). The peptides and their complex in another gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was stained with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and its substrate (figure 4, lower gel). With increasing concentrations of NP-1, the intensity of upper bands increased and that of the lower bands decreased, which suggests that formation of the upper band depends on the concentration of NP-1 and confirms that the band does not represent aggregates of CP-1.",

Therefore, we analysed the apparent molecular masses of the peptides NP-1, CP-1, and NP-1/CP-1 complex by sedimentation equilibration, which was successfully used to find out the mass of the six-helix bundle formed by the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides.17 The isolated NP-1 was a monomer and the molecular mass obtained for CP-1 corresponded to a trimer in phosphate-buffered saline (table 3\n). The HPLC-purified mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed a complex with a molecular mass of about 24 781 Da (figure 5\n), which was close to the calculated molecular mass of a trimer of dimers. These results were confirmed by SE-HPLC; NP-1 showed a single peak of monomer and CP-1 a major peak corresponding to a trimer, whereas the mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed three peaks corresponding to NP-1 monomer, CP-1 trimer, and NP-1/CP-1 trimer of heterodimer (hexamer) (figure 6\n). These findings suggest that NP-1 is a monomeric structure and that CP-1 has a trimeric conformation in phosphate-buffered saline. Once they are mixed at equimolar concentration, they interact to form a six-helix bundle consisting of three molecules of NP-1 and three of CP-1. This notion is consistent with the biophysical properties of the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides as shown by sedimentation equilibration and SE-HPLC.17, 30, 41\n",

The biophysical studies showed that the peptides derived from these regions of SARS-CoV spike proteins have similar properties to those derived from the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 and HR2 regions, respectively. For example, like the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides, NP-1 and CP-1 from SARS-CoV can interact to form high-order oligomeric helices, which may have important roles in the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells. On the basis of results from this study and knowledge about HIV-1 gp41 and other viral transmembrane proteins,14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 we propose a model to elucidate the fusogenic mechanism mediated by SARS-CoV spike protein and the mechanism by which CP-1 inhibits SARS-CoV infection (figure 8\n). In the native state, spike proteins on the virus surface could be in oligomeric form through the self-association of their partly helical HR2 regions to form the stems of the spikes on SARS-CoV; HR1 regions may be in random coil conformation covered by S1 domain. After the binding of the S1 domain to a receptor (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)7 on the target cell (receptor-binding state), the S2 domain changes conformation by forming \u03b1-helices, extending and inserting its inert fusion peptide into the target-cell membrane, and exposing HR1 and HR2 regions (intermediate pre-hairpin state). Then the HR1s form a trimer and the HR2 trimer dissociates to monomers. Subsequently, the HR2 monomers pack onto the grooves of the HR1 trimer to form the six-helix bundle. This fusion-active core structure brings the viral and target-cell membranes into close proximity, resulting in fusion between the membranes and formation of fusion pores, which allow the virus genome to enter the target cell. If a C-peptide, such as CP-1, is present in the intermediate state, it could bind to the HR1 region and block hexamer formation, thereby inhibiting fusion. However, more direct evidence is needed to validate this model. Nevertheless, the information obtained from other coronaviruses can provide indirect evidence to support the hypothesis.",

            "text": "Luo and colleagues42 have shown that the spike protein of murine hepatitis virus, like HIV-1 gp41,13, 18 contains HR1 and HR2 regions that may have important roles in spike-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry. Double alanine substitutions of the four middle heptadic leucine and isoleucine residues within the HR2 region lead to significant reduction in fusion activity and defects in spike oligomerisation. Bosch and co-workers43 reported the structural and functional characterisation of the fusion core complex formed by the HR1 and HR2 regions of the murine hepatitis virus spike protein. Although our group and theirs have worked independently on distinct coronaviruses by different approaches, we have obtained surprisingly similar results. First, only peptides derived from the HR2 region, not the HR1 region, have antiviral activity. Second, HR2 peptides derived from both murine hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV spike proteins have antiviral activity in the micromolar range. Third, the fragments involving the interaction between the HR1 and HR2 in spike proteins of both viruses are located in the same regions. These findings suggest that murine hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV have a common fusogenic mechanism, which may be shared by other coronaviruses. The peptides derived from the HR2 regions of the SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus spike proteins have much less potent inhibitory activity than HIV-1 gp41 C-peptides (eg, C34 and T-20), which have activity in the nanomolar range.16, 44 SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus may therefore have a fusogenic mechanism different from that of HIV-1. However, the peptides derived from the HR2 regions of many other enveloped viruses, including Ebola virus,23 Newcastle disease virus,24 parainfluenza virus,45 and respiratory syncytial virus,25 inhibit the corresponding virus infection also in the micromolar range, and these viruses have similar fusogenic mechanisms to HIV-1.23 Two major factors can affect the potency of a fusion-inhibitory peptide: the sensitivity of a virus to the corresponding antiviral peptides; and the sequence and conformation of the inhibitory peptide. The sensitivity of HIV-1 to the fusion-inhibitory peptide T-20 correlates with fusion kinetics, envelope/coreceptor affinity, and receptor density.46 Different viruses might have differing fusion rates or receptor-binding affinities. Therefore, these viruses might have different sensitivity to the corresponding inhibitory peptides. The antiviral activity of the peptidic fusion inhibitors depends on their optimum peptide sequences and conformations. Changes in their sequences or conformations could substantially affect their antiviral activity and the stability of the complexes they form.17, 47, 48 However, optimisation of the peptide sequence and conformation could improve antiviral activity.",

The SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein contains heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) sequences that are similar to those from HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp41. This similarity might help to elucidate the mechanism by which SARS-CoV enters target cells, and thus could have implications for treatment.This paper assesses the ability of synthesised peptides derived from the SARS-CoV HR1 and HR2 regions to inhibit a cytopathic effect in tissue culture, and it investigates the interactions between HR1 and HR2 peptides. Only the CP-1 peptide (derived from the HR2 region) had strong inhibitory activity in tissue culture. CP-1 and the NP-1 peptide (derived from the HR1 region) interacted to form a six-helix structure similar to the fusogenic core structure of HIV-1 gp41.\nIMPLICATIONS\nThese findings confirm that the carboxyl terminal portion of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is a type 1 fusion glycoprotein. A possible fusogenic mechanism involves CP-1 binding to the HR1 region, thereby interfering with conformational changes that lead to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes.\n",

            "text": "Therefore, CP-1 can be used as a lead in designing more potent anti-SARS-CoV peptides for drug development. Use of such peptides for treatment of SARS is better than application of anti-HIV peptides for chemotherapy of AIDS because only a few doses should be needed to treat an individual with acute SARS-CoV infection (no chronic SARS has been reported), whereas an HIV-infected individual might have to use T-20, one of the most expensive anti-HIV drugs, for life. Furthermore, the anti-SARS-CoV peptides might also be used prophylactically as nasal spray or inhalation formulations to protect at-risk populations working and travelling in SARS-endemic areas. The peptides derived from the HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein could be used to establish high-throughput assays for screening non-peptidic SARS-CoV fusion inhibitors; we have successfully developed several such assays with the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides for identification of small-molecule HIV-1 fusion inhibitors.20, 49, 50 Any compounds that block the HR1\u2013HR2 interaction could be used as leads for development of virus fusion inhibitors.",
