            "text": "Silk fibroin of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, is synthesized in the posterior silk gland (PSG) cells, secreted into the lumen of PSG, associated with sericin in the lumen of the middle silk gland (MSG) and spun out from the anterior silk gland as silk fibers to form a cocoon. The silk fibroin is secreted in a form of a 2.3-MDa protein complex designated as the elementary unit of fibroin [1] , which consists of six sets of heavy chain (H-chain; 350-kDa fibrous protein)-light chain (L-chain; 26 kDa) disulfide-linked heterodimer and one molecule of a glycoprotein, fibrohexamerin (fhx)/P25 [2, 3] . A single disulfide bond is formed between Cys172 of L-chain and Cys-c20 (20th residue from the C-terminus) of H-chain [4] . Fhx/P25 contains three N-linked oligosaccharide chains at Asn69, Asn113, Asn133 [1] and exists either in a 30-kDa (major) or 27-kDa (minor) molecular form [1, 5] , which has been suggested to have different compositions of oligosaccharide chains [1] . Fhx/P25 associates with (H-L) 6 mainly by hydrophobic interactions [5] and is centrally important in the maintenance of the elementary unit, because treatment of the elementary unit with 2% Triton X-100, N-glycosidase F or endo-H caused partial displacement or deglycosylation of fhx/P25 and simultaneously remarkable disintegration of the elementary unit [1] . On the other hand, treatment of the elementary unit with 1.3 mM dithiothreitol dissociated L-chains completely from H-chains without affecting the gross integrity of the once-formed elementary unit [1] . In the three fibroinsecretion-deficient naked-pupa mutant silkworms; Nd(2), Nd-s and Nd-s D , the level of secretion of fibroin is less than 1% of that in the normal level fibroin-producing breeds [6, 7] and the extremely small amounts of fibroin produced by these three mutant silkworms lack L-chains and show the composition of H 6 fhx 1 [1] . The disulfide linkage between H-and L-chains is not formed in Nd-s and Nd-s D mutants because of the lack of Cys-172 in the mutant L-chain [8] . It is of interest to note that the fhx/P25 in the secreted fibroin of the three naked-pupa mutants is only of the 27-kDa molecular form [5] .",

The PSG cell layers were washed in TMK [10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM KCl], immersed in 5 mL of TMK containing 0.25 M sucrose and 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, and were forced to pass successively through nylon meshes of 1-mm and 0.1-mm pore sizes. Cells passed through the two nylon meshes were gently disintegrated by passing through a 25-gauge needle six times to yield PSG cell lysate. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to sediment nuclei. The supernatant (2 mL per tube) was layered on 0.4-1.8 M linear sucrose gradient in TMK (12.2 mL per tube), centrifuged at 285 000 g in a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C, and 0.5-mL fractions were collected. Fractions containing ER were monitored by the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase assay [11] and by Western blotting with the rabbit anti-(Drosophila calnexin-peptide) Ig raised against a synthetic peptide, CAQTEESNTKRKRQARKE [12] . For the former assay, a 5-lL portion of each fraction was mixed with 100 lL of the assay mixture [0.08 mM cytochrome c (Sigma), 0.1 mM NADPH, 1 mM sodium azide, 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5)], incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 min and A 550 was measured. Fractions containing Golgi complex were monitored by the assay for Golgi a-mannosidase II [13] [14] [15] as follows. A 15-lL portion of each fraction was mixed with 135 lL of 0.89 mM 4-metylumbelliferyl-a-D-mannopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan), 0.22\u00b7 NaCl/P i , 0.11% Triton X-100, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and then 150 lL of 0.5 M glycine, 0.5 M Na 2 CO 3 was added to stop the reaction. The intensity of fluorescence was measured by Fluorescence Spectrometer F-3000 (Hitachi) at the exciting wavelength of 364 nm and the emission wavelength of 448 nm. Fractions containing ER only or ER plus Golgi were pooled, sonicated briefly and used as the ER extract or the ER plus Golgi mixed extracts.",

The ER extract was then separated on a gel filtration column of TSK-GEL HW75-F, and each fraction was examined by Western blotting with the anti-H-chain, the anti-L-chain, or the anti-fhx/P25 Ig (Fig. 1C ). Protein complexes containing H-and L-chains, and fhx/P25 were eluted between fractions 22 and 28, forming two peaks. Because the elution profile of the first peak (fractions 23 and 24, bracketed) was identical, in comparison with the elution profile of b-connectin (2.1 MDa), to that of the elementary unit isolated from PSG cells [1] , these fractions were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to re-chromatography on a TSK-GEL HW65-S gel filtration column (Fig. 1D ). The protein complex was eluted as a single peak at the position for approximately 2.3-MDa and consisted of H-chain, L-chain, and fhx/P25 as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 1D ). When fractions 13-15 (bracketed) were pooled and analyzed by the quantitative ELISA, the molar ratio of H-and L-chains, and fhx/P25 was shown to be close to 6 (H-chain) : 6 (L-chain) : 1 (fhx/P25) ( Table 1) . Because all these properties are identical to those of the elementary unit isolated from the total PSG cell extract (Table 1 and [1] ), we interpreted these results to indicate that the elementary unit of fibroin is assembled in ER.",

A similar molar ratio was obtained when the total ER extract was subjected to the quantitative ELISA ( Table 1) , suggesting that a substantial fraction of fhx/P25 molecules which was not assembled into the elementary unit was retained in ER. This notion was supported by the fact that the lower molecular-mass fraction of the ER extract (fractions 25-32 in Fig. 1C ) showed the molar ratio of H-chain : L-chain : fhx/P25 which was similar to that of the total ER extract ( Table 1) .",

In order to confirm these observations, fhx/P25 was partially purified from cocoon shells, ER extract, or ER plus Golgi mixed extracts of the normal breed C108 and subjected to Western blotting with the anti-fhx/P25 antibody or to the lectin blotting with biotinylated ConA before or after digestion with the bacterial a1,2-mannosidase or endo-H (Fig. 3A) . Fhx/P25 was detected as a 30-kDa single band in the ER extract (Fig. 3A , lane 2) but as two bands (30 and 27 kDa) in the ER plus Golgi mixed extracts (Fig. 3A, lane 3) or in cocoons (Fig. 3A, lane 1) . The 30-kDa fhx/P25 was converted to the 27-kDa single band by digestion with the bacterial a1,2-mannosidase (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6) , and the 30-and 27-kDa fhx/P25 were converted to the 24-kDa single band by digestion with endo-H (Fig. 3A , left panel, lanes 7-9). The reaction of fhx/P25 with biotinylated ConA became undetectable after digestion with endo-H (Fig. 3A,  right panel, lanes 7-9) . These results suggest that the 30-kDa component is the ER form of fhx/P25 and the 27-kDa component represents fhx/P25 whose N-linked oligosaccharide chains lost their terminal a1,2-mannose residues by digestion with a1,2-manosidases in Golgi complex, and further imply that fhx/P25 in the elementary unit of the normal-level fibroin-producing breeds is largely resistant to the action of a1,2-mannosidases in Golgi complex and secreted as the ER-type 30-kDa form. The PSG cell extract of Nd-s D mutant was subjected to the sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate ER and ER plus Golgi mixed fractions as for the normal breed J-139 (Fig. 1B) , and each fraction was sonicated briefly to yield an extract. When electrophoretic mobilities of partially purified fhx/P25 molecules from cocoon shells, the ER extract and the ER plus Golgi mixed extracts from Nd-s D mutant were compared, it was confirmed that only the 27-kDa fhx/P25 was present in the extremely small amount of fibroin secreted into cocoons (Fig. 3B, lane 1) , whereas only the 30-kDa form was present in the ER extract and both 30-(major) and 27-kDa (minor) forms were present in the ER plus Golgi mixed extracts (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 3) as for the normal breed C108 (Fig. 3A) . It is thus conceivable that in the Nd-s D mutant silkworm, fhx/P25 in the L-chain-free H 6 fhx 1 -type elementary unit (Table 2) is processed efficiently by the action of Golgi a1,2-mannosidases to yield only the 27-kDa molecule in the secreted fibroin. In order to examine a role of L-chain in the protection of a1,2-mannose residues of fhx/P25 in the elementary unit, the Nd-s D mutant silkworm was subjected to transgenesis with the normal L-chain promoter/cDNA sequence together with a marker gene of DsRed2 (Fig. 4A) , and two transgenic lines L6 \u00b7 7 and L7-4 were selected. The L6 \u00b7 7 line expressed DsRed2 strongly and the L-chain sequence was suggested to be integrated into two major genomic loci by Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 4B, lanes  2 and 3) with a probe specific to the normal L-chain gene (Fig. 4A) . Northern blot hybridization indicated that both normal L-chain mRNA and Nd-s D mutant L-chain mRNA were produced at high levels in a PSG-specific manner in the L6 \u00b7 7 line (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3) . Another transgenic line L7-4 expressed extremely low-levels of DsRed2 and the normal L-chain mRNA as judged by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (data not shown). In consistency with these results, the mean weight of cocoons produced (n \u00bc 50 each) was 110 mg for L6 \u00b7 7 and 20.1 mg for L7-4 as compared with 187 mg for C108 and 17.7 mg (consisting mostly of sericin) for Nd-s D .",

In all the cocoon protein samples, H-chain (Fig. 5A ) and fhx/P25 (Fig. 5C ) were detected. The normal L-chain was detected clearly after cleavage of disulfide bonds (Fig. 5B ) in the normal (C108; lane 5) and the two transgenic lines (lanes 7 and 8) but the mutant L-chain was undetectable in the cocoon protein sample from the Nd-s D mutant (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 6) . The anti-L-chain polyclonal antibody [1] used in these experiments could detect the Nd-s D mutant L-chain as well in the PSG cell extract (Fig. 1B) .

In the transgenic lines, fhx/P25 molecules of 30 and 27 kDa were both reactive to biotinylated ConA indicating that N-linked oligosaccharide chains existed in both types of molecules (Fig. 5D) .

Determination of molar ratios of H-chain, L-chain, and fhx/P25 in the fibroin secreted into cocoons of a normal breed (C108), Nd-s D mutant, or transgenic lines of B. mori. A 490 values were obtained by ELISA. Protein samples (all in 100 lL) assayed were 10 ng for H-chain, 50 ng for Lchain and 125 ng for fhx/P25 from cocoons of C108 and the transgenic line L6 \u00b7 7, or 2 lg for H-chain, 10 lg for L-chain and 100 lg for fhx/P25 from naked-pupa cocoons of Nd-s D and cocoons of the transgenic line L7-4. n \u00bc 6; \u00b1, SD; ND, not detected. breed J-139. It has been shown that the assembly of oligomeric protein complexes occurs generally in ER [24] but some protein complexes, such as connexin 43 of gap junctions [25] and M protein of coronavirus [26] , have been shown to be assembled in Golgi complex. In the case of silk fibroin, a vast amount of newly synthesized, high molecular-mass ( 350 kDa) fibrous H-chain molecules in ER must be transported efficiently, without being denatured, to Golgi complex for secretion from PSG cells. The assembly of the elementary unit in ER is most likely a crucial event to meet the ER quality control [27] and to ensure the efficient intracellular transport and secretion of H-chains. There seem to be two key events in the assembly of the (H-L) 6 fhx 1 -type elementary unit: (a) the formation of disulfide-linked H-L heterodimers and (b) the formation of the three-component protein complex in which the noncovalent association of the glycoprotein fhx/P25 is centrally important. The clue to the first event has been obtained from studies [8] on the naked-pupa mutants, Nd-s and Nd-s D . In these mutant silkworms, chimeric L-chains are formed because of the exon-shuffling mutation of the L-chain gene. These chimeric L-chains lack Cys172 which normally forms a disulfide bond with Cys-c20 (the 20th residue from the C-terminus) of the H-chain. The free sulfhydryl group of Cys-c20 on H-chains seem to be harmful for the transport of the elementary unit from ER to Golgi, because (a) the level of fibroin secretion is less than 1 and 4) , Nd-s D (lanes 2 and 5) or L6 \u00b7 7 (lanes 3 and 6) with the 357-bp L-chain cDNA probe (encoded by exons I, II, and III) common to C108 and Nd-s D L-chain mRNAs or with the cDNA probe for the B. mori elongation factor a-1 isoform as an internal control. 1% of the normal level, (b) ER is unusually enlarged in PSG cells, (c) the development of PSG is significantly retarded and (d) a thin, naked-pupa-type cocoons are formed in these mutants [7] . The present results that (a) the normal L-chain is expressed (b) the normal elementary unit is assembled and (c) the Nd-s D phenotypes with respect to the retardation of PSG development and the formation of thin cocoons were largely converted to the normal phenotypes in the L6 \u00b7 7 transgenic line expressing a significant level of the normal L-chain strongly support the above notion.",

            "text": "With respect to the second event in the assembly of the elementary unit, it is of interest to note that the extremely small amount of fibroin secreted into thin cocoons of the Nd-s D mutant formed the H 6 fhx 1 -type complex ( Table 2 ). These results suggest that, although very inefficient in the absence of L-chain, one molecule of fhx/P25 could associate noncovalently with six molecules of H-chains. We demonstrated previously that N-linked oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 were important in maintaining the integrity of the elementary unit [1] . However, considering the facts that oligosaccharide chains play important roles in the assembly of vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein [28, 29] , influenza virus hemagglutinin [30, 31] , and IgM [32] in ER, a further role of N-linked oligosacharide chains of fhx/P25 in the process of assembly of the elementary unit in ER may be speculated. With regard to this notion, the present finding that a relatively large amount of fhx/P25 molecules, i.e. about one third of molecular numbers of H-chain and L-chain (Table 1) , exists in ER without being assembled into the elementary unit is interesting. This observation seems to be consistent with the previous observation that concentrations of fhx/P25 mRNA and H-chain mRNA are roughly equimolar in PSG cells during the last intermolt stage [33] . The deduced sequence of fhx/P25 contains a typical signal peptide sequence at the N-terminal region [34] and the sequence is cleaved at the N-terminal side of Gly18 in the secreted fhx/P25 [1] . However, fhx/P25 does not contain the ER retention signal sequence [35] in its C-terminal region. Thus, it could be speculated that the retention of fhx/P25 molecules which were not assembled into the elementary unit in ER might be attained by interaction with other ER-resident proteins but the real reason remains to be elucidated.",

As suggested from the deduced primary structure of fhx/P25 [2, 3] , the presence of three N-linked oligosaccharide chains per a molecule of fhx/P25 was demonstrated [1] . Furthermore, conversion of the 30-kDa form of the purified or partially purified fhx/P25 to the 27-kDa form was achieved by digestion with the bacterial a1,2-mannosidase (this study). We can calculate molecular masses of fhx/P25 containing different numbers of mannose residues as follows: 29.74 kDa for a molecule containing three chains of GlcNAc 2 Man 9 and 27.58 kDa for a molecule containing three chains of GlcNAc 2 Man 5 , which are close to the 30-and 27-kDa forms of fhx/P25, respectively.",

In the giant polyploid cells of PSG, ER is fully developed [39] and we could not succeed in isolating a pure Golgi fraction which is not contaminated with ER. We also tried to compare digestibility of the terminal a1,2-mannose residues of N-linked oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 in the isolated intact elementary unit or in the L-chain-free elementary unit produced by the treatment with dithiothreitol as described [1] with the bacterial a1,2-mannosidase in vitro. However, this enzyme could not cleave the a1,2-mannose residues of fhx/P25 in either protein complex (data not shown), although the same enzyme could digest a1,2-mannose residues efficiently in purified or partially purified fhx/P25. We suspect that the dynamic configuration of the isolated elementary unit is different from that during the intracellular transport or the size of the bacterial a1,2-mannosidase dimer (180 kDa \u00b7 2 \u00bc 360 kDa) employed [17] is too large to access the oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 which have been suggested to be located internally of the elementary unit [1] .",

In the direct model, the L-chain has dual functions: formation of the disulfide-linked H-L heterodimer which is essential for the efficient transport of the H-chain-containing protein complex from ER to Golgi and protection of the terminal a1,2-mannose residues of fhx/P25 in the elementary unit. We suggested previously that the six sets of H-L dimers surrounded the centrally located fhx/P25 molecule in the elementary unit based on the observation that biotinylated ConA was accessible to the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 only after the treatment of the elementary unit with 2 M urea or 2% Triton X-100 [1] . The L-chains in the majority of elementary units may interact noncovalently with the oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 or act as structural barriers and cause protection of the terminal mannose residues from digestion with a1,2-mannosidases in Golgi complex. In the latter model, the function of the L-chain is to accelerate transport of the assembled elementary unit from ER to Golgi. A vast flow of elementary units containing H-L dimers and fhx/P25 into Golgi may result in conditions where molecular numbers of Golgi a1,2mannosidases become substantially insufficient and thus the majority of elementary units are allowed to leave Golgi for secretion without losing the a1,2-mannose residues of fhx/P25.",

It implies that numbers of the normal elementary unit are assembled in proportion to the available numbers of the normal L-chain, and the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 in those elementary units are protected to the similar extent from the action of Golgi a1,2mannosidases. These results seem to favor the direct model. On the other hand, the presence of 27-kDa fhx/P25 as a minor component in elementary units produced in the normal breeds seems to favor the indirect model. Perhaps the above two models may not be mutually exclusive. Although further experimental evidences are required to judge which mechanism is more likely, present results suggest that not only fhx/P25 but also L-chain play respective roles in the formation of the integral structure of the elementary unit of fibroin.",

The PSG cell lysate from a normal breed J-139 (A) or Nds D mutant (B) was subjected to sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. Each fraction was assayed for activities of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (an ER marker) and a-mannosidase II (a Golgi marker). Proteins in every other fraction were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-H-chain, the anti-L-chain, the anti-L28, the anti-Nd-s D , the anti-fhx/P25 or the anti-calnexin-peptide Igs. (C) The ER extract, prepared from pooled fractions 9-13 in (A), was fractionated on a TSK-GEL HW75-F gel filtration column and A 280 of each fraction was determined. Samples from every other fraction were subjected to SDS/PAGE and Western blotting with the anti-H-chain, the anti-L-chain, or the anti-fhx/P25 Igs. (D) Fractions 23 and 24 from five equivalent columns as in (C) were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to the second gel filtration chromatography on a TSK-GEL HW65-S column and Western blotting as in (C). b-Connectin (2.1 MDa), as a high molecular-mass marker[1], was detected by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R after 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate-2 to 15% gradient PAGE. extremely small amounts of fibroin secreted from the three naked-pupa mutants; Nd(2), Nd-s and Nd-s D[5]. The relative ratio of 30 : 27-kDa forms of fhx/P25 in the purified elementary unit preparation from J-139 was 69.3 (\u00b1 10.8) : 30.7 (\u00b1 10.8) (n \u00bc 5) as determined by densitometry after Western blotting. The purified 30-kDa fhx/P25 from J-139 was shown to be converted to the 27-kDa form by digestion with the bacterial a1,2-mannosidase, which cleaves terminal a1,2-linked mannose residues in N-linked oligosaccharide chains. On the other hand, partially purified 27-kDa fhx/P25 molecules from the three naked-pupa mutants were unchanged by the same treatment(Fig. 2, lanes 1-4 and 5-8). These results suggest that the 30-kDa fhx/P25 contains terminal a1,2-mannose residues in their N-linked oligosaccharide chains, whereas such mannose residues are absent in the 27-kDa fhx/P25. The N-linked oligosaccharide chains were suggested to be retained in the 27-kDa fhx/P25 of J-139 because both 30-and 27-kDa forms were converted to the 24-kDa form by digestion with endo-H",
