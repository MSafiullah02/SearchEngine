            "text": "This paper introduces a novel method of spectrum sensing in communication systems that utilizes nonuniform sampling in conjunction with a suitable spectral analysis tool. It is referred to here as spectral analysis for randomized sampling (SARS). Owing to the deployment of nonuniform sampling, the proposed technique can accomplish the sensing task by using sampling rates well below the ones demanded by uniform-sampling-based digital signal processing (DSP). The effect of the cyclostationary nature of the incoming digital communication signal on the adequacy of the adopted periodogram-type estimator for the spectrum sensing operation is addressed. The statistical characteristics of the estimator are presented. General reliability conditions on the length of the required signal observation window, i.e. sensing time, for a chosen sampling rate or vice versa are provided amid a sought system performance. The impact of the presence of noise and processing transmissions with various power levels on the derived dependability recommendations is given. The analytical results are illustrated by numerical examples. This paper establishes a new framework for efficient spectrum sensing where considerable savings on the sampling rate and number of processed samples can be attained.",

Nevertheless, new techniques keep unfolding such as [16] and a review is given in [17] . Whilst the aforementioned methods deal with arbitrary nonuniform sampling, the approach proposed here relies on the ability of the user to prescribe the positions of the sampling instants, i.e. randomized sampling and hence SARS. Spectral analysis of randomized sampling schemes for deterministic signals was studied in [18] [19] [20] . In this paper, the processed signal is assumed to be a random cyclostationary/nonstationary process. The earliest papers on DASP, e.g. [21, 22] , tackled SARS with the aim of estimating the signal's power spectral density (PSD) of wide sense stationary (WSS) signals; however the predicament of the estimators' accuracies for a finite number of samples was not resolved.",

Here, digital communication signals, which are modeled as cyclostationary processes, are analyzed and the scenario where the conveyed transmissions are of different power levels, e.g. due to the propagation channel gain, is considered. The reliability of detection is expressed in terms of the widely embraced receiver operating characteristics (ROC) in lieu of a general metric, i.e. Chebychev's inequality parameter as in [24] . Circumventing the nonstationary nature of the communication signals either via phase randomization [25, 26] or assuming pseudostationarity within a short signal time window [4, 12] is the common approach adopted in the literature. In [27], Gardner exposed the defects of such practices in an attempt to correct any errors incurred. In this paper, the effect of the signal's nonstationarity is acknowledged and its repercussions on the conducted spectral analysis are evaluated.

Its techniques have lately received notable attention due to their crucial role in the emerging cognitive radio (CR) technology, i.e. by unveiling spectral holes for opportunistic spectrum access. Several reviews on the topic exist, e.g. [1] [2] [3] [4] . This adds to the plethora of spectrum sensing application areas such as surveillance/interception [5] , astronomy [6, 7] and seismology [8] . Sensing methods that rely on nonparametric spectral analysis/estimation are regarded as efficient and adequate candidates for monitoring a wide frequency range consisting of a number of predefined nonoverlapping spectral subbands, without a priori knowledge of the signal's characteristics [1] [2] [3] . Such methods have clear advantages over single-band oriented ones, for instance those based on matched filtering or feature detecting that require the separation of the individual transmissions typically by tunable bandpass filtering [3] . In this paper, a multiband spectrum sensing technique that uses a periodogram-type spectral analysis tool to estimate the spectrum of the incoming signal from a finite set of its samples is adopted. This means has retained its popularity in several spectrum sensing studies, e.g. [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Failing to do so results in aliasing and irresolvable detection problems. In the event of examining wide bandwidths such a constraint can pose a challenge to the system designer where a high sampling rate, high speed signal processing and treating large quantities of data are required [2, 3] . Here, we demonstrate that we can detect the active spectral subbands by the suitable use of arbitrarily low rate nonuniform sampling and appropriate processing of the signal -a methodology referred to as digital alias-free signal processing (DASP). A few monographs, e.g. [14, 15] , give an overview on the topic.",

In fact, it is shown in the paper that the sampling rate of the introduced spectrum sensing approach can be arbitrarily low.

Additionally, attaining low resolution spectrographs via a short r T facilitates minimizing the number of needed frequency points per system subband to establish any activity within, i.e. save on computations noting that one frequency point per subband is examined in (2) . However, 0 T should be long enough so that the spectrum tapering does not overshadow the distinctive feature of ( , ) r C f t . Taking a number of multiples of the recommendation in [24] where 0 / C T n B \u2265 such that 0 n > serves as a reasonable guideline on choosing the width of the signal time analysis window.we notice that it is nearly constant at frequencies where there is no spectral activity and its values decrease upon increasing the average sampling rate \u03b1 . The variance has its highest values at frequencies where the signal is present and a substantial part of this inaccuracy is unaffected by \u03b1 . A classical tactic to minimize the latter error is to resort to averaging a number of ( , )e r X f t estimates from K signal windows. The adopted detector involves averaging K number of the ( , )e r X f t estimates from nonoverlapping signal windows of length 0 T such that particularly visible when dealing with scenarios where the occupancy of the monitored subbands is low.The introduced approach has been verified using numerical examples and simulations.In order to be able to reconstruct the detected signal from the collected samples, it is necessary that the sampling rates do exceed the Landau rate [31] , i.e. they should exceed at least twice the total bandwidth of the concurrently active subbands A B . This condition does not have to be met if spectrum sensing is the only goal. Even if signal reconstruction is to be performed, the SARS technique still offers an important advantage over the uniform-sampling-based detectors. In the case of SARS, the sampling rate has to be proportional to the number of the simultaneously active subbands. Whereas, with uniform sampling the sampling rate has to be proportional to the total monitored bandwidth. This observation prompts researching into algorithms for effective and accurate signal reconstruction from nonuniformly sampled data. This paper serves as an impetus to further research into DASP-based spectrum sensing approaches that deploy randomized sampling schemes other than total random sampling. ",
