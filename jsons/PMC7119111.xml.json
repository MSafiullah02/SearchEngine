The PSWAC identified the need for 97.5 MHz of additional radio spectrum for public safety by 2010, to address interoperability and capacity issues. In addition, the report identified that approximately 24 MHz would be needed within five years of the report; yet, by the fall of 2001, few of these recommendations had been implemented. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act enabled the FCC to allocate 24 MHz for public safety from television (TV) channels 60\u201369 (746\u2013806 MHz). Existing TV stations are to relinquish these channels by December 31, 2006, or when 85% of households in the market have switched to digital television (DTV), whichever is later. State and local governments need a firm date for planning, funding, system design, and construction. The current 85% exception creates a loophole that may hamper implementation of the 1997 rules. The December 31, 2006, date should be firm for making channels 63, 64, 68, 69, and adjacent channels 62, 65, and 67 available.",

Problems with communications have been documented where emergency calls are dropped, 9-1-1 operators are overwhelmed with multiple calls, and responses are delayed for lack of information.

As was shown in a field test conducted in western New York State, ACN systems can detect a crash that has occurred and automatically notify 9-1-1 dispatchers of the event and the location, leading to a decreased scene response time (RT).2 However, because the ACN system measures real-time collision parameters, such as force vector, change in velocity, and vehicle dynamics, it can also be used to predict the likelihood of injury in a given crash. If this technology were integrated with an organized trauma system, and if data were efficiently and effectively relayed to all care providers, it could not only expedite identification of vehicle crashes, but also predict injuries. This system will allow for streamlined delivery of appropriate medical care, including the selection of the appropriate transport mode and medical facility.",

The 90% fractile RT specifications required for county compliance include 10:59 minutes for emergency life-threatening calls (priority 1) and 12:59 minutes for emergency non\u2013life-threatening calls (priority 2). All emergency responses resulting in a priority 1 or priority 2 transport to a level 1 trauma-center emergency department over a six-month period were evaluated to determine the relation between specified and arbitrarily assigned RTs and survival. Of the 5,424 transports reviewed, no statistically significant difference in median RTs between survivors (6.4 minutes) and nonsurvivors (6.8 minutes) was noted. Further, no statistically significant difference was identified between observed and expected deaths. However, mortality risk was 1.58% for patients whose RT exceeded 5 minutes, and 0.51% for those whose RT was under 5 minutes. The mortality risk curve was generally flat over RT intervals exceeding 5 minutes. In this observational study, emergency calls in which the RT was less than 5 minutes were associated with improved survival when compared with calls in which the RT exceeded 5 minutes. Although variables other than time may be associated with this improved survival, there is little evidence in these data to suggest that changing this system's RT specifications to times less than current specifications, but greater than 5 minutes, would have any beneficial effect on survival.3\n",

Before 1979, EMS dispatchers typically did not have a single hour of medical training. Since that time, the concept of medical-priority dispatch training has spread throughout North America, with an estimated 400 municipalities using some form of medical-priority dispatching. The emergency medical dispatcher (EMD) is the principal link between the public caller requesting emergency medical assistance and the EMS resource-delivery system. The traditional medical dispatch systems that are used to dispatch EMS to medical emergencies include the following: 1) systematized caller interrogation questions, 2) systematized prearrival instructions, and 3) protocols matching the dispatcher's evaluation of injury or illness severity with vehicle-response mode and configuration. As such, the EMD plays a fundamental role in the ability of the EMS system to respond to a perceived medical emergency.",

The investigators examined how EMDs complied with the protocols contained in a dispatch system. Six key areas and overall compliance were studied.

The mean overall compliance score improved from 76.4% \u00b1 10.2% (mean \u00b1 SD) in the absence of performance feedback to 96.2% \u00b1 4.0% (n\n = 217; p < 0.001) when performance feedback was provided.

The study compared the prospective identification of patients as ALS or basic life support (BLS) using emergency medical dispatch with that using dispatch criteria based on chief complaint. Each patient served as his or her own control. The ALS or BLS priority was assigned using both chief-complaint and emergency medical dispatch criteria. Dispatching based on chief complaint meant that all patients with preestablished chief complaints received ALS without further triage questions, whereas emergency medical dispatch allowed the dispatchers to question callers using a scripted set of questions. The outcome measures included the number of calls categorized as ALS or BLS, the number of calls canceled by BLS, and the number of ALS calls released to BLS care. There were 11,174 patients enrolled. The use of emergency medical dispatch was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of calls designated as ALS (44.7% vs. 55.8%), as well as a statistically significant decrease in the number of ALS responses canceled by BLS (9.2% vs. 23.8%) and patients released to BLS by medical control (4.7% vs. 7.3%). The investigators concluded that implementation of an emergency medical dispatch system significantly decreased inappropriate ALS dispatching, as defined by a decreased rate of ALS cancellations and BLS releases.5\n",

There are numerous benefits to such a large and diverse group. Drawbacks are minimized by good communication, a common good, and organized leadership.

These decisions may need to be made by hospital administers on the fly, in consultation with clinicians. For example, a decision to use expired drugs or assignment of extra responsibilities to minimally trained staff might need to be considered. Many of these important decisions must take into account various legal considerations such as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), HIPAA, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, legal liabilities, insurance coverage, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines.",

Therefore, as the outbreak develops and the disease spreads, it may make sense to treat patients using a ward-style approach.

This may also include a disaster template for how to develop a community's capacity to respond to a disaster.

A good strategy to begin the planning for future needs would include the use of the recommendations from the EMS Agenda for the Future7 and to convene a national consensus panel for the purpose of establishing standards. A national template is needed that could be used by communities to achieve a fully interoperable response system. These strategies and the evaluation of best practices should be used to determine how funding dollars would be spent. Communities and national associations should be provided with a mechanism to allow feedback to policy makers at the federal level.
