Part of these proteins is, however, proteolytically degraded in the proteasomes, along with other cytosolic self-proteins or even proteins provenient from intracellular bacteria that have been also ubiquitinated. This degradation process generates peptides 6\u201330 amino acids (aa) long that may, potentially, bind to the MHC class I molecule peptidic cleft, in the endoplasmic reticulum, being transported to the cell surface. These peptides have little variation in size, presenting normally 8\u201312 amino acids. The peptide size restriction is due to the nature of the MHC I peptidic cleft, which presents closed extremities, contrasting to the peptidic cleft of MHC class II molecules which can accommodate longer sequences (up to 30 aa).",

The number of sequences yielded, in such case, would reach some hundreds. Considering that the exemplified protein size is relatively small and considering the classical idea that each CD8+ T cell recognizes only one peptide, the repertoire of memory T cells would have to be larger that 1012, the total number of lymphocytes in human beings, to be efficient [1]. Therefore, the recognition of peptidic sequences must involve mechanisms with a certain plasticity and adaptability, without, however, loss of specificity. This would allow the immune cell repertoire to be shaped according to ongoing experiences leading to the establishment of memory, but at the same time, it would allow the maintenance of a source of naive, inexperienced cells.",

Specifically, this limitation is due to spatial and/or numerical restrictions on the mature T cell pool, rather than the number of possible TCR rearrangements. The size of the potential TCR repertoire is estimated in 1015, considering all gene segment rearrangements and the imprecise junctions generated by insertions and deletions in the N terminal regions. This number is greater than the theoretical number for different nonamer peptides that could be generated, which equals 209\n[15].

A mathematical model supports this idea, predicting that a single TCR may be able to interact with over one million different peptides [16].

In fact, mice previously infected with LCMV were refractory to the tolerance induction to skin allogeneic graft. The susceptibility to tolerance induction is influenced by the immunological history of the individual, i.e., individuals that have suffered multiple viral infections tend to be more refractory to tolerance induction than those who have had less infections.

Thus, the task of reducing infection spreading can be delegated to cross-reactive cells and the organism will gain time to assemble a more specific artillery. The idea that cross-reactive T cells lead to a low affinity response to heterologous epitopes generated the argument that this could cause deleterious effects to the host, who would lack an acute, virus-specific immune response for some types of viral infections. In fact, some works have verified that such situation is possible and can be used by viruses as an extra evasion mechanism. It was observed that human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)-infected individuals that had developed cervical cancer presented an almost complete absence of specific T lymphocytes directed to the oncoprotein (HPV16) E711\u201319(20) epitope. Cross-reactivity between this epitope and a coronavirus epitope called NS252\u201360 was identified. It was proposed that frequent contacts with a virus could lead to an \u201cexhaustion\u201d of the T cell repertoire, which could lead to an inefficient CTL response. Moreover, this same HPV epitope presented considerable sequence homology with peptides from diverse organisms, including some sequences from self-peptides, providing support for the suggestion of toleration of the immune system [20]. Another strategy used by viruses to evade the immune system is exemplified by the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), which codes for an evasion immune protein (m152/gp40). This protein prevents the presentation of an immunodominant peptide, provenient from an antiapoptotic protein (M45), in pathologically relevant tissues. Thus, this peptide stimulates a CD8+ long-term response, but the target is not present in the tissues of interest [21].",

Interestingly, the TCRs from all isolated clones had substantial sequence homology in their CDR3 region 3. Cloning of the TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains from these cells, in a TCR-negative human cell line, and a subsequent analysis of interaction between the TCR and the antigenic peptides revealed TCR stimulation by both peptides, evidencing a degeneration or plasticity in the recognition of these lupus autoantigens by the T cell receptor.",

As previously mentioned, a number of peptide candidates fits this initial criteria of cross-reactivity induction, making this first step easy and feasible. After the identification of this potentially useful peptides, several admixtures could be elaborated, aiming at inducing protection to different virus-induced diseases. Certainly, the administration of such a peptide pool should be associated to adequate immune stimuli (meaning the inflammatory/infectious context necessary to induce immune responses) in order to enhance the probability of immune response stimulation and long term protection.",

            "text": "A second strategy is potentially more powerful than the first one, but also demands more time and studies to become a reality. It starts from the identification of patterns (in the amino acid sequence or in the biochemical properties) in immunodominant viral peptides (such as conserved amino acids in specific residues) that are capable to induce immune response against a broad range of different organisms. The deduced conserved amino acid sequences (or biochemical properties) should be used for the production of synthetic peptides containing the amino acid residues necessary for MHC anchoring and TCR contact. Except for these conserved residues, these synthetic peptides could be filled with amino acids with few or none lateral chains (that could interfere with the MHC/TCR contact). Thus, a priori, a limited number of highly conserved and immunogenic peptides could be enough to induce protection, by means of cross-reactivity, against a variety of virus.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, a series of technical problems surround the identification of conserved viral immunodominant peptides. Obviously, the existence of a \u201cgolden sequence\u201d containing the elements necessary to stimulate immune responses against all kinds of virus is highly improbable, although the identification of consensus sequences representing different viral groups is a concrete possibility. Also, different HLA alleles require different peptides as anchor motifs and this variability should also be considered during peptide screenings. It is important to point out that sometimes viral peptides are associated to the development of autoimmunity and, consequently, it will always be necessary to take into account the cross-reactive phenomenon as a whole and not only as a characteristic of immune responses against pathogens. Conversely, a potential application to conserved viral epitopes includes tolerance induction against peptides involved in autoimmune diseases. As discussed, these features do not invalidate the potential of immunodominant viral peptides as inducers of long term immune responses but points out the need of a deep knowledge of cross-reactivity phenomena.",

            "text": "Both vaccination approaches previously proposed have as an advantage, the use of single peptides instead of complex viral particles, when compared to conventional vaccine strategies. This is extremely relevant when organisms such as HCV or HIV are the therapy targets. Besides, if relevant conserved features in immunodominant peptides could be identified and associated to specific viral groups (a pool of peptides that confer protection against different IV lineages, for instance), the vaccine could be directed to this viral group, with minimal interference in the remaining T cell pool. Interestingly, as immunodominance hierarchy is affected by previous encounter with other epitopes, also subdominant epitopes could be envisaged as putative candidates to vaccine development. Thus, the analysis of immunodominant viral epitopes in search of particular features and the subsequent use of these features to the development of synthetic peptides with a \u201cviral pattern\u201d seems to be interesting steps towards the development of wide spectrum viral vaccines.",
