A large amount of these procedures took place in our Ambulatory Surgical Center, thus allowing an early discharge. Normally we have developed a follow up protocol, that include 2 visits to our office during the first post operative month, (1st week and 4 th week after surgery), another visit 6 month after the procedure, and one per year for 5 years since surgery was performed. Due to the pandemia and, local and global measures, we were forced to suspend our medical offices as well as elective procedures. The problem is now centered in the post operative follow up of those patients who underwent an elective procedure immediately before the isolation and those who are in their first month after surgery. Emergency surgeries are less frequent, however were considered when developing preventive measures.",
