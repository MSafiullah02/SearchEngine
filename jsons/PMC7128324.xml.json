            "text": "Each year, approximately 2000 Muslims travel from Marseille to participate in the Hajj, gathering with over two million pilgrims from all over the world. Health risks during the Hajj are a critical issue due to the extreme congestion of people [1]. Infectious diseases represent a major problem during the pilgrimage with acute respiratory infections (ARI) as the most common cause of admission to hospital [2, 3, 4]. Hajj pilgrims during their 1-month stay in Saudi Arabia experience relatively homogeneous accommodation conditions, and undertake identical rituals, while retracing the footsteps of the Prophet Mohammed, thus being very likely exposed to the same risk of ARI. In recent years, several non-randomized studies have linked statin use with decreased risk of severe sepsis or death from severe infections, including pneumonia [5, 6, 7]. Recent prospective cohort studies confirmed previous observations [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] while another suggested that the apparent beneficial effect of statins probably reflected a \u2018healthy user\u2019 effect, as statin users appeared to be younger, healthier, better educated, and socially and economically more privileged compared to non-statin users [13]. These controversial findings also raised questions about the potential role of statins in the prophylaxis of infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza [14]. Muslims departing from Marseille to participate in the Hajj have been found to have a median age of 61 years, with more than one third being over 64 years old [15], and are therefore likely to use statins in a significant proportion. We conducted a prospective epidemiological study to evaluate the incidence of febrile cough episodes among Hajj pilgrims from Marseille and to assess if statin use could have an influence on this incidence. The socio-economic situation and health characteristics of the travellers were not consistent with the hypothesis of a \u2018healthy user\u2019 effect.",

Multivariate analysis was performed using the spss version 15 software program (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Factors with a p value <0.25 in univariate models were included in a multivariate model, as suggested in the classical work of Mickey and Greenland [16]. Sex, age and statin use were also included in the model. A stepwise procedure based on likelihood ratio criteria was used in order to obtain the best criteria with the lowest Akaike criteria (AIC) [17, 18, 19].

Similarly, previous travel to Saudi Arabia, diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as vaccination against influenza had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough during the pilgrimage (Table 3\n). When considering only the cases of cough associated with fever, travelers with diabetes appeared to have an increased risk compared to other patients in univariate analysis (OR = 2.02 (1.1\u20133.7), p 0.02). Similarly, individuals of <65 years and unemployed had a greater risk of cough associated with fever (OR = 2.22 (0.98\u20135.03), p 0.05). Several factors appeared to be related to febrile cough, without reaching statistical significance. None of the other factors influenced the risk of febrile cough (Table 3). When adjusting factors for multivariate analyses, only diabetes remained associated with a higher risk of febrile cough (OR = 2.85 (1.37\u20135.92), p 0.005).",

Similarly, high rates of diabetes and hypertension were found in patients requiring admission to tertiary-care hospitals during the Muslim pilgrimage [20]. We also observed that the level of education of Hajj pilgrims was particularly low, with a proportion of 83.1% of individuals with a level of education below that of a certificate of primary school education compared to 42.3% in the total immigrant population and 24.1% in the general population of south eastern France (PACA) [21].

One study reported an incidence of ARI of 40% within a group of pilgrims from Riyadh [22]. A study based on clinical criteria of influenza-like illness among pilgrims from Pakistan reported rates of 36% in influenza-vaccinated pilgrims and 62% in pilgrims not vaccinated against influenza [23]. Another study involving English pilgrims, based on seroconversion rates, showed an attack rate of 30% among the vaccinated and 41% among the non-vaccinated participants [24]. Finally, an ARI attack rate of 26% was recently observed among medical team members treating pilgrims in Saudi Hospitals [25]. Vaccination coverage against influenza did not influence the occurrence of ARI in our experience, which strongly suggests that influenza virus was not the pathogen responsible for the observed symptoms. When investigating the pathogens causing respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients during the Hajj, H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae appeared to be the most common pathogens (30%) in one study [26], while Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the most common pathogen (20%) identified in a study on community-acquired pneumonias during the 1994 Hajj [27]. Viral pathogens are also commonly identified during the Hajj, representing 11\u201320% of pathogens responsible for upper respiratory tract infections in hospitalized pilgrims with Influenza A and B virus, rhinovirus and adenovirus being the most common [26, 27, 28, 29].",

Overcrowding and continuous close contact, notably in the desert plains of Mina and Arafat where accommodation in collective tents is necessary, greatly increases the spread of respiratory tract infections. Under these conditions a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome during the Hajj may cause an epidemic of unprecedented scale. During pre-Hajj consultation such an event should be considered in counselling travellers. Hand disinfection with alcohol-based scrubs should be recommended as it was proven to protect from ARI development; it should be acceptable to most pilgrims given the religious insistence on ritual purity before the five daily prayers [32]. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has recommended that masks be used to minimize droplet spread [33]. However, regular use of surgical face-masks was recently shown to offer no significant protection against ARI, and intermittent use of surgical-type masks is associated with increased risk of infection [25]. Furthermore, many Muslims consider covering of the face during the Hajj to be prohibited; therefore general compliance with this advice is unlikely. Vaccination against H. influenzae and Pneumococcus should be recommended to travellers suffering from chronic respiratory disease and diabetes mellitus conditions. Vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and pertussis should be updated when required and vaccination against influenza systematically proposed.",
