The mean serum sodium concentration in severe/critical patients (137.0) was significantly lower than those in mild and moderate patients (140.8 and 138.7, respectively). Such findings were confirmed in a retrospective cohort study, of which the mean serum sodium concentration in all patients was 137.5 mmol/L, and the significant differences were found between the mild (139.2) and moderate (137.2) patients, and the mild and severe/critical (136.6) patients. Interestingly, such changes were not obvious in the serum chlorine and potassium concentrations. Conclusions The low sodium state of patients with COVID-19 may not be the consequence of virus infection, but could be a physiological state possibly caused by living habits such as low salt diet and during aging process, which may result in ACE2 overexpression, and increase the risk and severity of COVID-19. These findings may provide a new idea for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

In animal studies, it was found that the decrease of salt intake can upregulate the expression of ACE2 through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). 20, 21 Therefore, we could speculate that the long-term low salt diet or the condition of sodium insufficiency may result in the low body sodium and the overexpression of ACE2 in lower respiratory tract cells, which could increase the susceptibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we aimed to find a key risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic by investigating the relationship between the blood sodium concentration and the severity of patients with COVID-19 through a systematic reviews, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study.",

            "text": "In this study, we found that the patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 on admission have presented the low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) that were related to the disease severity. The occurrence of such a condition may not be the consequence of virus infection, but should be a physiological state being existed in the body before virus infection. There were no clear reasons that could cause such a significant reduction of blood sodium concentration because diarrhea and vomiting occurred only in a small number of patients. The fever, a main symptom of patients with CIVID-19, may lead to dehydration and then should increase, but not reduce the blood sodium concentration. Therefore, we could boldly speculate that the low blood sodium population, especially the elderly and people with underlying diseases, may increase the risk and illness severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one possible explanation is that the people companied with long-term hyponatremia may increase the expression of ACE2 in tissue cells, especially in lung cells, through the RAAS. 20, 21 Hyponatremia is closely related to the incidence and severity of community-acquired pneumonia and perforated acute appendicitis in children. [24] [25] [26] Clinical studies have showed that the elderly are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and become more severe than the young and middle aged people, which may be due to the lower blood sodium levels in the elderly population. One of the reasons may be the decrease of the regulation mechanism of sodium ion in the elderly, including the decrease of renal reabsorption function for sodium ion during aging process; however, another key reason may be the result of long-term low sodium diet. For a long time, especially in the developed countries, the strategy of low sodium diet being actively implemented by physicians, medical organizations and public health agencies has played an important role in preventing and controlling hypertension and related diseases, 27,28 however, some recent evidence suggests that very low sodium intake may actually have adverse effects on human health, which may also preset a very unfavorable state in certain population against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we found that some young severe patients with CODIV-19 had serious hyponatremia, reinforcing our interpretations. In addition, the low susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the minors suggests that the relative high levels of blood sodium may play a role in fighting against the virus infection. Whether an age-dependent change in blood sodium levels is related to increasing expression of ACE2 in human tissue cells, in particular in alveolar cells, remains to be experimentally confirmed.",

The serum chloride and potassium concentrations were not correlated to the severity of patients(Table 1,Figure 2D, F).For the retrospective cohort analysis, we collected data of 244 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 59 non-Covid-19 patients as control from a single center (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University) between Dec 30, 2019 and Feb 27, 2020 (from Dec 1, 2019 to Jan 9, 2020 for control). The data of age, gender and severity of patients with and without COVID-19 were summarized in Table 2. The average age was 57.49 years (57.49\u00b119.13) from 7-96 years in the patients with COVID-19, and 51.07 years (51.07\u00b119.21) from 10-90 years in the control group. 127 of 244 (52.05%) were male, 117 (47.95 %) were female, and 7 were minors (2.87 %) in the COVID-19 group. The numbers of mild, moderate, severe and critical patients were 65, 61, 77, and 41, respectively. We have obtained very similar results as those in the systematic review and meta-analysis (Table 2, Figure 3): the mean serum sodium concentration in all patients was 137.5 mmol/L (137.5\u00b14.12, n=244, Table 2, Figure 3A, D), which was much lower than the median value of normal reference range (142.0 mmol/L, 137.0 -147.0,",
