The first coxsackievirus was isolated only in 1948 in New York state (USA) by Dalldorf et al, who were investigating an outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis in the village of Coxsackie. They discovered a new group of viruses pathogenic for suckling mice. The observation led to the widespread use of suckling mice in the investigation of the viral etiology of poliomyelitis-like illnesses. The conditions of their isolation led some investigators to believe that the new viruses were only \u2018common fellow travellers of poliovirus\u2019. But it rapidly became clear that these viruses had a full range of morbidity.",

It has been shown recently that the major cell receptor for CB is a 46 kDa protein that also mediates the attachment of adenoviruses 2 and 5 and has been called coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). The gene coding for this protein is located on chromosome 21. Some CA and CB strains are also able to bind to another receptor \u2013 the complement regulatory protein decay accelerating factor (DAF) \u2013 that has been shown to be the major receptor of echoviruses types 6, 7 and 12.\nThe \u03b1\nv\n\u03b2\n3 integrin (vitronectin receptor) is involved in the entry of CA9 in host cells whereas CA types 13, 15, 18, 20 and 21 use ICAM-1 as cellular receptor (Table 2\n).

Briefly, the genome is about 7500 bases and is flanked by two nontranslating poly (A) regions (NTR) 5\u2032 and 3\u2032. A small protein, VPg, is linked to the 5\u2032-NTR (Fig. 1\n). In contrast with most eukaryotic messenger RNA molecules, the 5\u2032 NTRs of enteroviruses contain\ninternal ribosomal entry sequences (IRES) so that ribosomes may bind in the absence of a free 5\u2032 capped terminus. The RNA acts as an mRNA which encodes directly a high-molecular-weight polyprotein, p220, consisting of three segments coding for the three precursor proteins, namely P1, P2 and P3. A cascade of cleavages carried out by virus-encoded serine proteases (2A and 3C) leads to 11 polypeptides among which are the final structural proteins of the capsid. These structural proteins are derived from the P1 segment (mol. wt 97000) of p220 (Fig. 1).",

VP4 is an internal protein linked to the genome. The epitopes which bind neutralizing antibodies are mainly present on VP1. Nevertheless, minor epitopes are also present on VP2 and VP3.

Infection in the infant ranges from mild to severe, even fatal. Meningitis, myocarditis, pneumonia, encephalitis, hepatitis and pancreatitis may be encountered.

In contrast, encephalitis, poliomyelitis, brown fat necrosis, endomyopericarditis and pancreatitis are the main lesions observed in animals infected with CB. Myositis is rare and, when present, it is much more limited. These considerations may explain the finding that the usual signs of CB infection in mice are spasticity and fine tremors rather than the flaccid paralysis commonly observed with CA infection.

Inflammation and necrosis peak during the second week; then, these lesions decrease and are progressively replaced by fibrosis. During the acute phase of myocarditis, infectious virions can be recovered from the heart. At the end of the first month, a chronic myocarditis, characterized by an interstitial fibrosis and a mild infiltrate of mononuclear cells, can occur in some strains of mice; at this stage, no infectious virus can be cultured but RNA genome is detected by in situ hybridization in a small proportion of myocytes around the foci of fibrosis. Specific cytotoxic T cells and autoantibodies seem to play a leading part in the constitution of both acute and chronic lesions.
