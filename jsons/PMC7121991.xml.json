            "text": "Respiratory tract infections consist one of the major health problem of society, because they lead to high rates of hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality. Essential feature of respiratory viruses is their easiness of transmission, especially in places with great density of people (schools, governments, mall centers, and means of public transport) (Brydak 2007). Elder people, children up to 24 months and persons from high risk groups are particularly exposed to respiratory viruses\u2019 infections. The most frequently circulating respiratory viruses are: influenza virus type A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) and B (RSV-B), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (PIV-1,-2,-3), human coronavirus (hCoV), adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (hRV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Infections caused by respiratory viruses can have different clinical symptoms, while specific set of symptoms can be induced by different viruses. Despite usually mild course of disease, some viruses causing certain disease entity can result in serious complications. Furthermore, not only viruses can cause particular illness, but also bacteria. Therefore, quick and appropriate diagnostic is crucial for administering proper treatment (Stefa\u0144ska et al. 2013). What is more, organism attacked by one pathogen has reduced immunity and becomes vulnerable to the subsequent ones. In this way numerous co-infections occur, which can result in death (Brydak 2008, 2011).",

RT-PCR reactions were performed in capillary tubes in 20 \u03bcl volumes with 0.5 \u03bcM primers and 0.2 \u03bcM probe for each reaction. According to WHO recommendations. The primers GRswH1-349Fw, GRswH1-601Rv, GRsw-N1-975Fw, GRswN1-1084Rv, H3h-319Fw, H3h-377Rv, N2h-1150bFw, N2h-1344Rv, and probes GRswH1-538, GRswN1-10465b, H3h-358, N2h1290 were used (WHO 2014). The reaction mixture, containing reaction buffer, MgSO4 buffer, BSA, RNase-free H2O, and SuperScript\u00ae III/Platinum\u00ae Taq Mix, was incubated with 5 \u03bcl RNA sample per capillary tube. RNA from vaccine viruses A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09 and A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) were introduced as the positive control sample and RNase-free H2O was utilized as the negative control sample. Before DNA amplification cycles were begun, the RNA templates were reverse transcribed to produce the corresponding cDNA templates during reverse transcription procedure: 45 \u00b0C for 15 min. DNA templates were then subjected to an initialization step (1 cycle at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min), followed by 50 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 10 s and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 20 s.",
