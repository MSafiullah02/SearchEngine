Two mechanisms of virus injury are hypothesized: (1) direct-virus injury and (2) cytokine storm. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is highly expressed in type II alveolar cells, intestinal epithelia, vascular endothelium, and cardiac muscle. ACE2 is also identified in the nervous system leading to direct-virus injury [1]. A subgroup of patients might have severe cytokine storm consistent with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis causing a fatal hypercytokinemia with multi-organ failure. Indirect mechanism of neurological injury mainly relates to increased coagulation activity, markedly increased D-dimer concentrations in these patients [5,6] leading to increased risk of thromboembolic stroke [7] as well as compromised cardiac status due to associated cardiac injury [8]. We describe use of neuroimaging, incidence and spectrum of acute neuroimaging findings and their prognostic role in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York City.",

A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens [9]. Initial tests were conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; as of March 16, tests were conducted in our clinical laboratory using the Roche SARS-CoV2 assay in the Cobas 6800 instruments through emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA. On March 31 we added testing using the SARS-CoV2 Xpert Xpress assay in the Cepheid GeneXpert instruments also under EUA by FDA. The targets amplified by these assays are the ORF1/a and E in the Roche Cobas assay and N2 and E genes in the Cepheid XpertXpress. Since March 16, only pharyngeal samples were collected and tested. Each neuroimaging study was evaluated for acute neuroimaging findings related to COVID-19 and all disagreements were resolved with consensus by the four fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize the cohort and Student's t-test to compare mean ages. To assess the risk of mortality conferred by positive neuroimaging findings, a multivariable logistic regression (LR) model was adjusted for age, body mass index and hypertension in a sub-group of 2894 patients. These covariates were selected a priori based on known risks for neurologic and COVID-19 complications, while limiting covariates to avoid overfitting the model. As a secondary analysis, to account for right censoring from hospitalizations still in progress, we constructed a competing risk regression survival analysis (CRR) with the competing risk being hospital discharge.",

The acute stroke incidence was 1.1% among all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our study also demonstrates that an acute stroke finding on neuroimaging is a strong prognostic marker of poor outcome. Only 5.4% of the total imaging examinations performed on COVID-19 patients were neuroimaging studies. Neuroimaging studies have tended to constitute a larger percentage of overall diagnostic imaging use in hospital admitted patients. However, COVID-19 being a pandemic associated primarily with pulmonary disease, has led to the chest being the predominant organ imaged. Neurological manifestations attributed to COVID-19 infection include headache, encephalopathy or delirium, stroke, and seizures [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Our incidence of stroke as determined by neuroimaging findings is lower than 2.8% incidence found in patients admitted through an emergency department [10]. A recent publication has also shown a decrease in the use of stroke imaging both in patients with severe strokes and in nonelderly patients who may have been at low risk for Covid-19 complications [11]. Nonetheless, it may be difficult to obtain the true incidence of neurological manifestations related to COVID-19 due to the following factors. First, most neurologic complications, such as delirium, encephalopathy, inflammatory neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction, may or may not be associated with abnormalities on neuroimaging. The reported yield of neuroimaging for hospitalized patients with delirium ranges from 2.7% to 14.5% across studies [12]. Second, strict patient isolation and need for extreme contact precautions and stringent infection control measures may have limited the ability to perform detailed neurological examinations and obtain neuroimaging especially MRI, which is the mainstay of acute stroke diagnosis. Moreover, critically ill, intubated patients are difficult to transport and image and hence may have been underdiagnosed. Finally, critically ill patients are often sedated, making it difficult to identify new neurologic complications. Hence, obtaining more expert neurology consultations, detailed neurological examinations and neuroimaging for early and accurate diagnosis of these often fatal neurological complications could improve our understanding of the disease and its neurological manifestations.",

It is no surprise that emerging evidence shows that COVID-19 may also predispose patients to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to diffuse intravascular coagulation, hypoxia, cytokine storm and immobilization [6]. High D-dimer levels, a marker of inflammation, are known to be associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 [8]. Acute strokes seen in the current study are also likely related to thromboembolic disease and majority were present at the initial admission. Most importantly, our data demonstrates for the first time, that when a neuroimaging shows acute large ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke in admitted COVID-19 patients, it is one of the strongest prognostic markers of poor outcome, even more than age and other previously reported co-morbidities such as hypertension and obesity [8]. COVID-19 patients who have a large ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke on imaging have a 50% mortality in the current study.",
