Recent studies have described broad patterns of pathogen host range1,3 and various host or microbial factors that facilitate cross-species transmission5,7,8, or have focused on factors promoting pathogen and parasite sharing within specific mammalian taxonomic groups including primates9,10,11, bats12,13,14, and rodents12,15\u2014but to date there has been no comprehensive, species-level analysis of viral sharing between humans and all mammals. Here we create, and then analyse, a database of 2,805 mammal\u2013virus associations, including 754 mammal species (14% of global mammal diversity) from 15 orders and 586 unique viral species (every recognized virus found in mammals16) from 28 viral families (Methods). We use these data to test hypotheses on the determinants of viral richness and viral sharing with humans. We fit three inter-related models to elucidate specific components of the process of zoonotic spillover (Extended Data Fig. 1). First, we identify factors that influence total viral richness (that is, the number of unique viral species found in a given host, including those which may have the potential to infect humans). Second, we identify and rank the ecological, phylogenetic and life-history traits that make some species more likely hosts of zoonoses than others. Third, recognizing that not all mammalian viruses will have the biological capacity to infect humans, we identify and rank viral traits that increase the likelihood of a virus being zoonotic.",

Of 586 mammalian viruses in our dataset, 263 (44.9%) have been detected in humans, 75 of which are exclusively human and 188 (71.5% of human viruses) zoonotic\u2014defined operationally here as viruses detected at least once in humans and at least once in another mammal species (Methods). The proportion of zoonotic viruses is higher for RNA (159 of 382, 41.6%) than DNA (29 of 205, 14.1%) viruses. The observed number of viruses per wild host species was comparable when averaged across orders, but bats, primates, and rodents had a higher proportion of observed zoonotic viruses compared to other groups of mammals (Fig. 1). Species in other orders (for example, Cingulata, Pilosa, Didelphimorphia, Eulipotyphla) also shared a majority of their observed viruses with humans, but data were limited in these less diverse and poorly studied orders. Several species of domesticated ungulates (orders Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla) are outliers for their number of observed viruses, but these species have a relatively low proportion of zoonotic viruses (Fig. 1; Supplementary Discussion).",

However, these studies weight all species equally. In reality, the risk of zoonotic viral transmission, or spillover, probably varies among host species owing to differences in underlying viral richness, opportunity for contact with humans, propensity to exhibit clinical signs that exacerbate viral shedding18, other ecological, behavioural and life-history differences5,12,15, and phylogenetic proximity to humans10. We hypothesize that the number of viruses a given mammal species shares with humans increases with phylogenetic proximity to humans and with opportunity for human contact. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify and rank host-specific predictors (ecological, life history, taxonomic, and phylogenetic traits, and a control for research effort) of the number of total and zoonotic viruses in mammals (Methods; Supplementary Table 1).",

Not surprisingly, research effort had the strongest effect on the total number of viruses per host, explaining 31.9% of the total deviance for this model (Extended Data Table 1). The remaining 17.3% can be explained by biological factors, a value greater than or comparable to studies examining much narrower groups of mammal hosts10,12,15 (Supplementary Discussion). Mammal sympatry was the second most important predictor of total viral richness (Fig. 2d). Our model selection consistently identified mammal sympatry calculated at a \u226520% area overlap over other thresholds explored (Methods), providing insight into the minimum geographic overlap needed to facilitate viral sharing between hosts. Host geographic range was also significantly associated with increasing total viral richness, although the strength of this effect was low (Fig. 2c). Several mammalian orders, Chiroptera (bats), Rodentia (rodents), Primates, Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), and Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) listed here in order of relative deviance explained, had a significantly greater mean viral richness than predicted by the other variables (Fig. 2e). This finding highlights these taxa as important targets for global viral discovery in wildlife4, and suggests that traits not captured in our analysis (for example, immunological function, social structure, and other life-history variables) may underlie their capacity to harbour a greater number of viral species. Our models to predict total viral richness were comparable when excluding virus\u2013host associations detected by serology, that is, using the \u2018stringent data\u2019, and were robust when validated with random cross-validation tests (Extended Data Table 1; Supplementary Table 2). However, we identified several regions that showed significant bias when cross-validated by excluding mammals from zoogeographic areas, suggesting that there are location-specific factors that remain unexplained in our models (Methods; Supplementary Table 3).",

A large fraction of the deviance explained is driven by the observed total viral richness per host, supporting the biological assumption that the number of viruses that infect humans scales positively with the size of the potential \u2018zoonotic pool\u201919 in each reservoir host. Removing this contribution by including observed total viral richness per host as an offset, the model explains 33% of the total deviance in the proportion of viruses that are zoonotic (Methods), with 30% of total deviance explained by biological factors (Fig. 2f\u2013i). Some mammalian orders had a significant positive (bats) or negative (two ungulate orders) effect on the proportion of zoonotic viruses (Fig. 2i). A number of previous studies have proposed that bats are special among mammals as reservoir hosts of a large number of recently emerging high-profile zoonoses (for example, SARS, Ebola virus, MERS)12,13,20. Our study tests this hypothesis in the context of all known mammalian viruses and hosts. While other mammalian orders have relatively high proportions of observed zoonoses and others have been poorly studied (Fig. 1a), our model results show that bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders after controlling for reporting effort and other predictor variables.",

This is the first time this relationship has been demonstrated using data for all mammals and specifically as a determinant of zoonotic spillover, and is supported by previous taxon-specific studies that have examined host relatedness and parasite/pathogen sharing in primates9,10, bats14 and plants21. The proportion of zoonotic viruses shows some upward drift for mammals that are very phylogenetically distant from humans (Fig. 2g) that may represent an artefact of preferentially screening marsupials for human viruses. While primate species largely drive the phylogenetic effect, our best-fit model excluded the effect of the order Primates as a discrete variable (Fig. 2i), suggesting that continuous variation in phylogenetic distance across primate species is more important, and is significant even when all mammals are included. This finding highlights the need to uncover the mechanism by which phylogeny affects spillover risk, for example, evolutionarily related species sharing host cell receptors and viral binding affinities22,23 and specific viral mutations that may expand host range in related mammal species24.",

The response curve for urban to rural population suggests that increasing urbanization raises the risk of zoonotic spillover (Fig. 2h), as does increasing human population density and the change in urban to rural population ratio over time. A single global metric of human\u2013wildlife ecological contact did not emerge across models. However, the alternate inclusion of these related variables points to the importance of human\u2013animal contact in defining per-species spillover risk globally, and the need for controlled field experiments and human behavioural risk studies to uncover the mechanisms underlying this risk. Overall, the strength of the effect of phylogenetic proximity was stronger than our proxies for animal\u2013human contact in predicting proportion of zoonoses (30\u201344% stronger explanatory factor), but both remained significant after controlling for research effort (Extended Data Table 1).",

We then project these \u2018missing viruses\u2019 and \u2018missing zoonoses\u2019 geographically (Fig. 3, Extended Data Figs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) to identify regions of the world where targeted, future surveillance to find new viruses and zoonoses will be most effective. In the process of translating our non-spatial, species-level predictions to geographic space, we identified several regions where our model predictions of the number of total and zoonotic viruses were systematically biased (hatched regions in Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; Methods). Local factors contributing to this bias may include geographic variation in the detection probability of human and/or wildlife viruses, indicating areas where additional research and capacity strengthening for viral detection are most needed. Our model predictions were not systematically biased or clustered across host phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 9).",

Areas where \u2018missing zoonoses\u2019 predictions were systematically biased varied by taxonomic order, but included large parts of Africa for the all-mammal dataset (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Figs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8f). By contrast, the distribution of bias in predicting the \u2018missing viruses\u2019 for all mammals was limited to patches of northeastern Asia, Greenland, peninsular Malaysia, and scattered grid cells in western Asia and Patagonia (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We also identify geographic regions with large numbers of mammal species currently lacking any information regarding their viral diversity (Extended Data Figs 3i\u20138i). In combination, these maps can be used for cost-effective allocation of resources for viral discovery programs, such as the Global Virome Project (D. Carroll et al., submitted).",

The best model for determining whether or not a known virus (n = 586 mammalian viruses) has been observed as zoonotic explained 27.2% of total deviance and included maximum phylogenetic host breadth (PHB\u2014a virus-specific trait that measures the phylogenetic range of known hosts, excluding humans), research effort, whether or not a virus replicates in the cytoplasm, is vector-borne, or is enveloped, and average genome length (Fig. 4). Using the \u2018stringent\u2019 dataset to define whether a virus is zoonotic resulted in a reduced model that excluded enveloped status and genome length (Extended Data Table 1). Our findings confirm a positive relationship between zoonotic potential and ability to replicate in the cytoplasm7, and that viruses with arthropod vectors may be able to infect a wider range of mammalian hosts5. Our phylogenetically explicit measure of host breadth, PHB, can be used at various hierarchical taxonomic levels to quantify and rank viruses from specialist to generalist, and was the strongest predictor of zoonotic potential (12.4% of total deviance explained). This highlights the value of field programs to identify the natural host range of newly discovered pathogens in order to develop early proxies for their zoonotic potential4. Significant variation in PHB across viral families is suggestive of intrinsic differences in the ability of a virus to infect diverse hosts, and this relates to the proportion of observed zoonoses in each family (Fig. 4a).",

First, our estimates of missing viruses and missing zoonoses per species are based on the current maximum observed research effort from the literature, and these estimates should be viewed as relative, not absolute. The true size of the undiscovered mammalian virome will probably increase with new genetic tools for unbiased viral discovery and in-depth studies that repeatedly sample wildlife populations over time25. Second, our ecological and biological predictor variables only explain a portion of the total variation in viral richness per host and zoonotic potential based on viral traits, although this is greater than that reported in comparable order-specific studies10,12. Third, while we control for research effort we cannot account for viruses or host associations that have completely evaded human detection to date, nor those identified but not published. Additional resources to support better data sharing and on-the-ground viral surveillance in the species and regions we identify would help validate predictive models to identify zoonotic viral hotspots, and streamline costly efforts to develop measures to prevent their future emergence.",

All viral species names were synonymized to ICTV 8th edition, which was the global authority on viral taxonomy at the start of our data collection in 2010 (ref. 16). From 2010\u201315 the authors and a team of research assistants and interns at EcoHealth Alliance compiled mammal species associations for each of 586 unique viruses published in the literature between 1940\u20132015 initially by using the virus name and synonyms as the search keywords in the major online reference databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar) in addition to searching in books, reviews, and literature cited in sources we had already obtained. To narrow the search for hosts for well-researched viruses, we additionally included the terms \u2018host(s)\u2019, \u2018reservoir\u2019, \u2018wildlife\u2019, \u2018animals\u2019, \u2018surveillance\u2019, and other relevant terms to find publications related to host range.

We also recorded the number of disease-related publications for each species using the scientific binomial AND topic keyword: disease* OR virus* OR pathogen* OR parasit*. The * operator was used in our search criteria to capture all words that begin with each term, for example, \u2018parasit*\u2019 would return hits for \u2018parasite\u2019, \u2018parasites\u2019, and \u2018parasitic\u2019. These search criteria broadly included papers that examined disease or diseases, virus or viruses, pathogen or pathogens, parasite parasites, or parasitology, for each species. Only one measure of per-host research effort was included at a time in model selection. As these metrics are highly correlated and the number of disease related citations per host outperformed the total number of publications per host in all but one model (all-data zoonoses), we decided to use disease-related publications as our per-species research effort measure for all models to improve interpretability. We also recorded the number of publications for each of 586 virus species using a keyword search by virus name in PubMed and Web of Science.

Blomberg\u2019s K measures phylogenetic signal in a given trait by quantifying trait variance relative to an expectation under a Brownian motion null model of evolution using a phylogenetic tree with varying branch lengths. Blomberg\u2019s K-values are scaled from 0 to infinity, with a value of 0 equal to no phylogenetic signal and values greater than 1 equal to strong phylogenetic signal for closely related species that share more similar trait values. While there is no clearly defined K value cut-off in which to apply phylogenetic comparative methods, non-significant value of <1, or more conservatively <0.5, are typical for traits that are phylogenetically independent. The only host variables we examined with significant K values >0.5 were host body mass, and our direct measure of phylogenetic distance to humans. While there are several tools available to control for phylogeny in multivariate analyses, for example, using phylogenetic generalized least square models (for example, PGLS)41, there is currently no modelling approach to control for phylogeny using GAMs. More importantly, a wholesale effort to control for phylogeny across all variables in our analysis was not appropriate here, as we are explicitly testing the relative importance of phylogenetic distance to humans versus other host traits including measures of human\u2013wildlife contact to predict the proportion of zoonotic viruses for a given host species. This left body mass as the only variable in our models, excluding our direct measures of phylogenetic distance, with a significant Blomberg K value that was greater than 1. We controlled for the significant effect of shared evolutionary history using a phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR)42,43 on body mass. The PVR approach allowed us to remove phylogenetic signal for any phylogenetically non-independent variables and then include the corrected values back in our GAMs, while retaining predictor variables like phylogenetic distance to humans as unmodified. We calculated PVR for body mass using the R package PVR and our custom-build maximum likelihood host phylogeny using cytochrome b sequences constrained to the order-level topology of the mammalian supertree28,44. Our new variable for body mass that controls for phylogenetic signal (PVRcytb_resid) removed most of the phylogenetic signal, with K = 3.5 unadjusted, and K < 0.5 after PVR correction. Our new metric of body mass scales in the same way, with larger values equal to species with larger body mass. PVR body mass was included in our GAM model selection for the total viral richness and zoonotic virus models.",

We synonymized all host species names between the mammal supertree and the host associations in our database using the IUCN Red List33. If the species was listed as \u2018cattle\u2019 it was assumed to be Bos taurus, all other records were excluded if there was ambiguity as to the scientific name for the host species. Second, a maximum likelihood cytochrome b tree was generated using the constraint of a multifurcating tree with taxa constrained to their respective orders and the order-level topology matching that of the mammal supertree6, as per this Newick tree file: (MONOTREMATA,((DIDELPHIMORPHIA,(DIPROTODONTIA,PERAMELEMORPHIA)),(PROBOSCIDEA,((PILOSA,CINGULATA),((((RODENTIA,LAGOMORPHA),(PRIMATES,SCANDENTIA)),((((CETARTIODACTYLA,PERISSODACTYLA),CARNIVORA),CHIROPTERA),EULIPOTYPHLA))))))). This generated a higher-resolution species-level mammal tree using cytochrome b data, with more reliable positioning of the higher-level taxonomic relationships than was obtained in exploratory phylogenetic analyses using cytochrome b data alone. GenBank accession numbers and cytochrome b sequence lengths for each species are provided in in our data and code repository. Cytochrome b gene fragments ranged from 143 to 1,140 bp, with >1,000 bp available for 558/665 (84%) of the taxa.

Our use of GAMs, an incorporation of smooth spline predictor functions into the generalized linear model (GLM) framework, allowed us to examine the functional form of our predictor variables (for example, Figs 2 and 4). Categorical and binary variables (for example, host order, IUCN status of hunted or not, and certain viral traits) were fit as random effects of each variable level. We used automated term selection by double penalty smoothing52 to eliminate variables from the models. This method removes variables with little to no predictive power and has been shown to be comparable or superior to comparing alternate models with and without variables. We did use the model comparison method for domestic animals, where the sample size was not sufficient for fitting all variables. In this case dropping variables by double penalty smoothing still allowed pruning the model list to eliminate redundant models. Where there were competing variables measuring the same mechanistic effect, we fit alternate GAMs using only one of each of these variables (as specified in below and in the Extended Data Fig. 1). These included phylogenetic variables, citation counts from alternate databases, and different measures of human population/host overlap. For example, to capture host phylogeny we used phylogenetic distance based on either the mammal supertree20 or a purpose-built cytochrome b constrained by the topology of the mammal supertree, but never both in the same model. For human population variables, we looked at either variables measuring overlap of species range with human-occupied areas, or human population in those areas, as area- and population-based measures were highly co-linear. For citation variables, we looked at either all citations or the number of disease-related citations for each host species, not both, and similarly citations in either PubMed or Web of Knowledge. We used a binomial GAM to analyse the 586 mammalian viruses in our database and identify viral traits that may serve as predictors of zoonotic potential. Co-linearity was not a major issue among variables included in the same model.",

Using QGIS55, a mammal-specific zoogeographical shapefile provided by Holt\u2019s group at the University of Copenhagen (http://macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace) was intersected (using QGIS Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Intersect) with a shapefile of IUCN\u2019s host ranges for all mammals in our database. Areas of these intersections were then calculated using an equal-area projection (Mollweide), and each host was assigned to only the region that contained the greatest proportion of its range. We systematically removed all observations (species) from each given zoogeographical region, re-fit the model using all observations from outside the region, then performed a non-parametric permutation test comparing the predicted values to the observed values for that region. Non-significant results indicate that model predictions are unbiased. Significant results for a given zoogeographic region suggest that there are location-specific biases that remain unexplained. This systematic zoogeographic cross-validation supported the overall robustness of our model predictions for several models, that is, all-data zoonoses, all-data total viral richness, and stringent-data total viral richness models. For these models, even though a majority of zoogeographic regions were unbiased, we still identified several zoogeographic regions that showed significant bias. Our zoogeographic cross-validation was equivocal for the stringent-data zoonoses model, with eight regions that showed evidence of bias and seven regions which showed no evidence of bias (Supplementary Table 3).",

For three of our best-fit GAMs (all-data total viruses, stringent-data total viruses, and stringent-data zoonoses) the addition of zoogeographical region as a categorical random effect decreased the model AIC and increased the total deviance explained by 3\u20135%. The all-data zoonoses model, which was used to create the series of maps in the main manuscript, does not improve with the inclusion of zoogeographical region. However, the improved predictive power of models using region-specific terms is offset by the increase in degrees of freedom (that is, if we included 31 zoogeographic regions as separate terms) and, more importantly, a decreased interpretability of our models\u2014especially when compared to the geographical variables we used, such as host area or species range overlap with human modified habitat. We opted not to include these random effects in our final GAMs in favour of keeping only variables interpretable in the context of our host trait-specific framework. Instead, we indicate areas of geographic bias directly on our spatially mapped outputs. (See \u2018Calculating and visualizing missing viruses and missing zoonoses\u2019, below.)

To estimate the area of host geographic range covered by crops, pastures, rural and urban areas\u2014as measures of global human contact with a given wildlife species\u2014each species polygon was intersected (overlapped) with spatial data representing those land cover types. Additionally, we calculated the total number of people within each host geographic range using data from HYDE database56, and also separately totalled the number of people in rural and urban populations. We obtained data on the distribution of cropland, pastures, rural and urban areas also from the HYDE database56 for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2005 with a spatial resolution of 5 \u00d7 5 arc minutes, equivalent to 10 km by 10 km at the equator. These datasets were created by combining information from satellite imagery and sub-national crop and pasture statistics56. In our GAMs, we used several transformations of these variables as competing proxies for human\u2013wildlife contact: the log-transformed area of host range that overlapped each type of human-modified land cover, log-transformed human population in the host range, log-transformed human population density in the host range, and the log-ratio of urban and rural human populations in the host range. For each of these, we also included as a variable the change in value from 1970 to 2005. Human\u2013wildlife contact variables that significantly covaried were excluded (set as competing terms) during the model selection process. The ratio of urban to rural human population was used to disentangle variables of human\u2013wildlife contact that significantly covaried. For example, the total area of a species range that overlapped with urban and rural areas was highly correlated with the total geographic area variables we examined (for example, total area, and area in crop, pasture, rural, and urban). The ratio of urban to rural population allowed us to separate these signals and best represent this proxy of per-species human\u2013wildlife contact.

This was accomplished by summing the residuals from 100,000 random draws of species in our dataset that was equal to the number of species present in that grid cell, then identifying grid cells where the observed bias was outside the middle 95% of the randomly drawn distribution. We calculated this for all mammals, and separately for each order across all grid cells. Areas with observed bias (outside of 95% of the randomly drawn distribution) are shown with hatched regions on each missing virus and missing zoonoses map.",

Significant variables from each best-fit GAM are noted with an asterisk. Zoonotic viral spillover first depends on the underlying total viral richness in mammal populations and the ecological, taxonomic, and life-history traits that govern this diversity (GAM 1). Second, host- and virus-specific factors may facilitate viral spillover. We examine the relative importance of host phylogenetic distance to humans, ecological opportunity for contact, or other species-specific life-history and taxonomic traits (GAM 2), and identify viral traits associated with a higher likelihood of an observed virus being zoonotic (GAM 3). We estimate the total and zoonotic viral richness per host species using GAMs 1 and 2, and calculate the missing viruses and missing zoonoses under a scenario of increased research effort (b, Methods). Owing to imperfect surveillance in both humans and wildlife and biases in viral detection, there may be uncertainty in the exact proportion of viruses that are zoonotic (b, light grey), and also between the actual, or true, viral richness (dotted lines) and the predicted maximum viral richness per host (dashed line).",
