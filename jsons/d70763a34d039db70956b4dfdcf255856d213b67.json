Based on the results of blood tests, the patient was negative for collagen disease and vasculitis. The causative microorganism of pneumonia could not be identified. However, the patient's lung lesions were rapidly expanding, and testing for novel coronavirus infection was indicated, even without travel history to foreign countries or an identified case contact. Finally, he was treated with mechanical ventilation because of acute respiratory failure. RT-PCR test of intrabronchial sputum confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

A study of the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia showed that pneumonia mostly worsened approximately 10 days after initial diagnosis [8] . In this case, consolidation and GGO was observed on the right upper lobe on the 5th day after onset, but these lesions extensively spread in both lungs on the 12th day after onset. Chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are reportedly varied [9, 10] and it was thought to be difficult to suspect COVID-19 pneumonia without travel history to foreign countries or apparent contacts with confirmed cases.",

We started high dose methyl prednisolone treatment and supported the patient with mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status and radiography did not worsen after high dose steroid treatment. However, we could not evaluate the efficacy of steroid treatment, because he was transferred to a designated hospital after diagnosis. We believe systemic corticosteroid treatment should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia as reported by Russell et al. [11] .",

We think it important to diagnose moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 in community-acquired pneumonia cases, applying RT-PCR tests for definitive diagnosis and separating them from other people. In addition, differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia by CT images may be useful. Based on reports that the risk of infection diminishes after 14 days [12] , we determined that the patient's close contacts should stop working for 14 days. However, it is unclear that suspension from work for two weeks is adequate to determine infected individuals. Lan et al. [13] reported that recurrent viral activity might occur. Isolation of contacts, asymptomatic carriers, and mild patients from hospital staff is thought to be important to prevent nosocomial transmission of COVID-19.",
