Infections and diseases caused by infective agents have been recorded even in ancient times, too. Biblical records clearly mentioned about the havoc caused by plague. Although descriptions of infections and infectious diseases in older times were not well documented, infections at the present time have been well documented and recorded. Human life always remains vulnerable to infections throughout his/her life irrespective of age, sex, race, or any other variable that we can imagine. One should not be surprised to know that human life can be infected even before someone is born. The infections before birth are commonly called as prenatal infections, e.g., infection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) is one of the most common prenatally reported infections. We can easily conclude a fact that infections and life are very closely associated with each other. During the last century, medical sciences have been credited with two major discoveries, i.e., vaccines and antibiotics. Vaccines and antibiotics brought dramatic changes reducing the morbidity as well as preventing the mortality caused by some of these infections. The success to control infections with the use of vaccines and antibiotics is so tremendous that these discoveries almost lead us to believe that we are wining the war against microbes/infections. Knowing the current status as well as realizing the current scenario about infection and infectious diseases can we claim if the abovementioned statement still holds the water!!! A sudden eruption and reporting of new and more fatal diseases like SARS, HIV, Ebola, swine flu, etc., to name a few if not all. Some of these diseases remained confined within certain geographical boundaries, while some were presented with their sporadic presence. HIV infections have been reported as a new type of infection. During the last quarter of the twentieth century, HIV infections are indiscriminate to age, sex, and race, and soon it was realized that HIV infections do not even know any geographical boundaries. HIV does not show any sporadic presence or any seasonal dependency. As a matter of fact, HIV infections raised eyebrows of policy makers due to the global presence of HIV which soon started taking the shape of a global epidemic. HIV being a global epidemic has received unprecedented attention from all quarters of life may it be the government or nongovernment organizations. HIV even attracted attention of various religious groups due to the homosexual behavior of the initial HIV patients reported with HIV infections. This mysterious infection due to its fatal nature and quantum of infected people has received more than warranted attention from scientists, clinicians, policy makers, media, etc. But what were the reasons behind such a public attention or outcry for HIV infections? Still there are no conclusive answers to it, but there are certain theories which prevail behind it.",

Ideally these cases were unknowingly \u201cknown\u201d cases of HIV and AIDS. These initial cases were reported with a rare lung infection. These patients were suffering from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (Gottlieb et al. 1981). PCP is known as an opportunistic infection. Only severely immune compromised host or patients get affected by PCP which is considered as a fatal disease. In the year 1981, the term AIDS was not even coined, so these patients were diagnosed with PCP not as patients of HIV/AIDS. Later it was recognized that these PCP patients were actually patients of AIDS. This is the reason these cases can be considered as unknowingly \u201cknown\u201d patients of AIDS.",

It will not be wrong to say AIDS is the ultimate and final chapter of life of a HIV patient. Clinically AIDS is defined as high viral load and low CD4+ T-cell counts (<200 cell/ml of blood) along with the presence of AIDS-defining diseases like HAD, HIV wasting syndrome, AIDS-defining cancers like Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma, etc. (www.who.int). It is commonly believed that HIV is a single virus, though as a matter of fact there are two types of HIV, and those two different types of HIV are HIV-1 and HIV-2. Out of these two different types of HIV, HIV-1 is more prevalent with global presence and with fatal consequences, while in contrast HIV-2 is less prevalent and causes a slow progressing disease. This chapter is focused on HIV-1 and the term HIV in the chapter implies HIV-1.",

MMWR is a publication from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA. The rationale question is why these patients were classified as PCP patients rather than AIDS patients. The answer is that, at that time the term AIDS was neither a part of general vocabulary nor even a part of medical dictionary. Nonexistence of the AIDS term is the major reason for the existence of this discrepancy in literature. The most fascinating fact about the saga of AIDS is that the world community is indebted to the alertness of a technician Ms. Sandra Ford at CDC where she was responsible for dispensing a rare and controlled drug, pentamidine. She had seen an unusual increase in numbers of requests to dispense this very rare medicine. Due to her alertness, Ms. Ford brought this matter to the attention of her bosses at CDC. This fact was verified in her interview to a famous US magazine Newsweek. Her statement is like this:",

The role of gay lifestyle started giving strength to this new and fatal disease though very soon this assumption turned out to be wrong because by late 1982, a 20-month-old child was also reported with this new and fatal disease. As per the clinical history, the child had received multiple blood transfusions. Later it was realized that the cause of this disease in this 20-month-old child could be the blood, or transmission of new infection could be due to the transfusion of infected blood.",

These observations have been helpful to delink this myth about the connection of new and fatal disease with unique lifestyle followed by gay men. Therefore, lifestyle-related name used for this disease has lost their relevance. To avoid further confusions among clinicians, there was a dire need to coin a new term and appropriate name for this new disease. To address this overgrowing problem, a meeting was convened on July 24, 1982, in Washington, and in this meeting AIDS was coined as a new name for this new and fatal disease.",

The quantum of this disease can be realized from the spread of this disease with a fact that by year 1983, 3064 cases of AIDS were reported out of which 1292 had already died (https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/overview). These numbers about AIDS patients had been a motivating factor to realize the sense of urgency regarding this disease among various sections of the society.

This first publication was authored by 12 investigators (Barre-Sinousi et al. 1983). The contribution of Montagnier\u2019s work was finally recognized by awarding him the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2008. Unfortunately, Montagnier\u2019s publication did not attract the required attention from scientific community for almost a year till the findings of another group from the USA were published in the same journal. In May 4, 1984, issue of Science, findings from Robert Gallo\u2019s group at National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, USA, were published (G). This new article was authored by 13 investigators of Gallo\u2019s group wherein they have given the name of this virus as human T-cell lymphotropic virus. Later it was decided that both of them (Montagnier and Gallo) should be equally credited for the discovery of this new organism.",

WHO also declared December 1st as World AIDS Day in 1991. By the year 1996 the United Nations Organization (UNO) had established a Joint United Nations Programme (UNAIDS) to advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS epidemic and to coordinate the response across the world. The annual report of UNAIDS is considered as one of the most authentic reports on the global status of HIV and AIDS. As per UNAIDS report of 2018, there is a significant decline of new infections (especially among children of age less than 15 years) and deaths due to AIDS, while access to ART and funds to deal with HIV/AIDS epidemics has seen an increasing trend (http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2018/unaids-data-2018).",

An increase in total number of HIV-infected people is due to two confounding factors, i.e., (1) new HIV infection and (2) now HIV-infected persons who are living longer due to improved ART as well as a significant decline in AIDS-related deaths. Out of the 36.9 million infected people, adults account for 35.1 million out of which men are 18.2 million and women are 16.8 million, while children below the age of 15 years are 1.8 millions. The most encouraging fact about HIV infections is consistent decline in new infections since the first report. In 2017, new infections reported are 1.8 million (in the range of 1.4\u20132.4 million) which is ~14% decline of new HIV infections in the last 7 years, i.e., 2010. Out of these 1.8 million new HIV infections, 1.6 million cases are reported among adults, while only 0.18 million new HIV infections are reported from children below the age of 15 years. Decline of new infections among children is 21% compared to adults where decline of new infections is only 11.1%. This new observation is certainly a very good sign toward a better control over spread of new HIV infections in the present time. A significant decline in vertical transmission of HIV infection must have played a crucial role for this decline among children. Similarly deaths related to AIDS have also been reduced to 0.94 million compared to 1.2 million in 2010 which amounts to ~21% decline in death due to AIDS and AIDS-related diseases in 2017 compared to 2010. The most satisfying part of this data is the better access for ART treatment to HIV-infected patients. At present around 21.4 million people with HIV infection have access to ART compared to only 11.4 million in 2010. This data suggests that in the last 7 years, access to ART has almost doubled and in the near future access to ART is expected to improve further globally. Since 2010, there is a consistent increase in the financial resources available to deal with HIV epidemic. By the end of 2017, more than 21 billion US dollars were available to deal with HIV epidemic.",

If we do the math, it means that on annual basis, we are adding more than 0.8 million HIV-infected people to the already existing pool of HIV-infected individuals, which is almost more than the population of majority of capital cities of European nation, barring few large cities; the majority of HIV seropositives and AIDS patients live in underdeveloped nations as well as developing nations. Such a high number of HIV seropositives in these nations is indicative of multiple factors, viz., poor implementation of surveillance program, poor health care and health-care system, poor living conditions, lack of resources, social factors, etc. There is no doubt that more serious and concerted efforts are warranted at local, national, and international levels to bring a better control of HIV epidemic especially in underdeveloped and developing nations.",

The binding of NNRTI to RT enzyme prevents the nucleoside binding to the catalytic site. Binding of NNRTI to RT enzyme does not require any further activation (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 2005). The example of NNRTI group of drugs is nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, etc.",

During HIV replication cycle, the role of viral proteases is very important for maturation of viruses. Protease is a homodimer comprised of 99 amino acid monomers. HIV protease cleaves gag and gag-pol polyproteins which are precursors to produce mature and active proteins, and these proteins are protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and integrase. This is the reason viral protease is an important drug target. Protease inhibitors block active site of enzyme so that viral proteases cannot function. A nonfunctional viral protease produces immature and non-infective virions, so a protease inhibitor can reduce or inhibit the production of new virions from infective cells. HIV can still replicate in the presence of PI but will not be able to form a mature virus. PIs are essential components of combination therapy, i.e., HAART. Use of PIs has reduced the problem of drug resistance. Toxicity and side effects are common with PIs. Some of the common PIs are indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, etc. (Saag et al. 2018).",

Fuzeon is a polypeptide comprising of 36 amino acids. Since Fuzeon is a polypeptide, this drug is not orally bioavailable. Bioavailability is one of the major drawbacks associated with FIs.

HAART regimen has been widely accepted since 1996 to treat patients facing the problem of drug resistance. Regimen for HAART was developed and decided by a panel of experts from the National Institutes of Health and other international organizations. Basically HAART uses a combination of three or more anti-HIV drugs, preferably from different classes. HAART has various advantages like the following: (1) HAART reduces the complexity of dose scheduling, (2) HAART reduces the problems related to the complex drug schedules and regimen, (3) HAART is helpful to achieve synergism between drugs used to treat HIV infections, (4) HAART reduces the drug toxicity with the decrease in the doses of different drugs, (5) HAART decreases the possibility for the development of drug resistance, and (6) HAART targets various steps of HIV replication, Therefore HAART can be very effective to control HIV infections. So many advantages associated with HAART have been the reason for effective use of HAART regimen. It is difficult to realize or even to recognize the probable number of combinations that can be used in a HAART regimen. So far ~25 different drugs are licensed to be used as anti-HIV drug.",

Nonavailability of any suitable animal model for HIV infections is one of the major hurdles to evaluate anti-retroviral drugs in vivo. So, scientists have developed various in vitro assays to evaluate toxicity and anti-retroviral activity of anti-HIV drugs. This test is based on the survival of cells infected with HIV in the presence of anti-retroviral drugs or anti-HIV drugs. These in vitro assays have been adopted in a format to evaluate anti-HIV drugs even on a large scale. The basic principle to evaluate anti-HIV drugs is to assess either cell death or cell viability in the presence of anti-HIV drugs. The advantage of this assay is that one can evaluate two important aspects of anti-HIV drugs, and those aspects are (1) to evaluate toxicity of anti-HIV drugs and (2) to evaluate the anti-HIV effect.

CNS is one of the most well-protected organ systems of the body. CNS is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which regulates the entry of any biomolecule in the CNS. The reasons or causative factors for the development of neuroAIDS get more intriguing by knowing the fact that most of the cells in CNS are not permissive to HIV and neurons in particular. Most of the cells of CNS are non-permissive to HIV because cells of CNS do not express receptors for HIV infections. Entry of HIV to the brain is also not possible due to the very fine control of the BBB. One of the most probable answers for HIV infections to CNS can be explained on the basis of \u201cTrojan horse hypothesis.\u201d As per the assumption of this hypothesis, HIV enters into the CNS through the HIV-infected cells from systemic circulation like monocytes or T-cells. These infected cells may find their entry to the brain due to alteration in the permeability of BBB (Verma et al. 2010). There could be various factors and reasons for alteration in the permeability of BBB. After entry of infected cells to the brain, these cells remain latently infected and remain in the brain for a long period of time. At certain point of time, these latently infected cells may start HIV replication. The trigger for the activation of these latently infected cells is not known or not yet well defined, but active replication of HIV in the brain could lead to the production of various other biomolecules of viral origins. In turn these biomolecules may start or initiate the induction as well as production of different pro-inflammatory and inflammatory cytokines in the local milieu. Certainly these pro-inflammatory and inflammatory cytokines are important in protective immune response, but in CNS these biomolecules could induce neuronal death via apoptosis. Since neurons do not regenerate, therefore inadvertent loss of neurons could lead to permanent damage to CNS or the brain (Olivier et al. 2018).",

The situation is quite worrisome as an estimated 2.3 million children less than 15 years of age are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. These children may manifest mild to severe neurocognitive disorders with psychiatric symptoms in the long run (Wilmhurst et al. 2018). As per some estimates, NeuroAIDS may have potential to become one of the major health concerns among long-term HIV seropositives who are under proper anti-retroviral treatments. Some of the major concerns for neuroAIDS patients are the following: (1) the total number of HIV/AIDS patients is increasing globally on a daily basis; (2) among the majority of HIV seropositives, neuroAIDS hits them at the prime of their life span, e.g., mostly between the age group of 35 and 45; (3) symptoms of neuroAIDS render these patients least productive in their prime of life; (4) neuroAIDS results in substantial loss of either individual or family income; (5) need of a caretaker causes extra burden to financial resources of the family or individuals; (6) ART is already an expensive treatment, and further additional cost for the treatment of neuroAIDS just exaggerates or worsens the financial situation; etc.",

Serious, committed, and dedicated research efforts in the area of HIV/AIDS have been quite successful to bring a better control over the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Still a cure for HIV/AIDS is far from reality. Everyone in this world still have a hope that one day we will be able to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. The question is how? and when? Some of the probable answers do come from the nature itself!!! Some clues can be drawn from elite controllers and long-term non-progressors with reference to HIV infections. One and the only example for this approach is none other than the \u201cBerlin man.\u201d Berlin man is an HIV-positive patient who has undergone bone marrow transplantation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) from a healthy donor. Since the bone marrow transplantation, Berlin man remained free from HIV infections for more than 10 years by now. So what was the reason for bone marrow transplantation in this patient? What are the scientific rationales for the success behind this new and probable cure for HIV?",

Information was collected from certain individuals, who were classified under high-risk category to contract HIV based on their lifestyles. The most interesting observation was that even though these individuals were following a high-risk lifestyle they did not get infected with HIV. The value for this observation was further added with a known fact that these high-risk individuals were never on any type of anti-retroviral treatments. Therefore, it was concluded that there are very good possibilities that these high-risk individuals for HIV/AIDS may have some kind of \u201cnatural resistance\u201d against HIV infections. This natural resistance in these individuals prevents HIV infections to them, even though they are following a high-risk lifestyle.",

At this stage it is important to reiterate that the primary receptor of HIV infections is CD4 receptors, but co-receptors are also important for HIV infections along with the requirement of primary receptors. Two different types of co-receptors have been identified for HIV infectivity, and these two co-receptors are CXCR4 and CCR5. On the basis of requirement of co-receptors for HIV infectivity, even HIV strains are divided into two categories. HIV strain which needs CXCR4 co-receptor for its infectivity is called as X-4 strain, and the HIV strain which requires CCR5 for its infectivity is called R5.",

            "text": "The extensive researches have demonstrated that these high-risk individuals which are resistant to HIV infection are presented with mutation in one of the co-receptors, i.e., CCR5. This mutation is a deletion mutation for CCR5 gene. A 32 bp sequence of DNA was found to be deleted in these individuals. Due to deletion of 32 bp, this mutation is known as \u039432 deletion. Story about the mutation of CCR5 co-receptors gets further complicated due to homozygous nature of mutation as well as heterozygous nature of mutation. It was observed that individuals with homozygous mutations for \u039432, i.e., CCR5 \u039432/ \u039432, are fully resistant to HIV infections. On the other hand, individuals with heterozygous mutation were presented with a slow progression of disease even after the exposure to HIV. So far, it has been reported that \u039432 mutation CCR5 exists only among Caucasians. The frequency of CCR5 \u039432 mutation is very low. The frequency of this mutation among Caucasian population is merely ~1\u20133%. This observation has significant clinical significance toward a possible cure for HIV. Such a low frequency for this mutation could be a major bottleneck for the application of this clinical approach for the treatment of HIV seropositives along with other relevant aspects related to it. A low frequency of this mutation among Caucasians must not discourage us to make this as a possible cure for HIV. There are numerous advancements in the area of gene therapy and stem cell research which may add value to this strategy as one of the probable cures for HIV. So far, Berlin man has remained a success story for the cure of incurable HIV infections.",

Berlin man is a 40-year-old Caucasian male who was HIV positive for >10 years. He has an excellent control over HIV because he was on HAART regimen. But problem started with him when he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This patient was not responding to the AML treatment. Under these circumstances except allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, this patient was left with no other choices for the treatment of AML. At this point of time, the surgeon who was treating this patient took extra precautions for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The surgeon chose to do the bone marrow transplantation from a donor carrying CCR5\u039432/\u039432 mutation to this patient (recipient of bone marrow transplantation). After a successful bone marrow transplantation with mutated (CCR5\u039432/\u039432) bone marrow, this patient did not show any signs for HIV positivity, even though anti-retroviral treatment was stopped for this patient (H\u00fctter et al. 2009). Clinicians are hopeful that this patient may remain HIV-free, but still the concerns about the possibility for the activation of HIV from HIV reservoir do exist in this patient. The answer to this question or these questions has to wait simply for time.",
