The article by Booth et al. in this issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases [3] suggests that airborne dissemination of SARS-CoV may also occur in the health-care setting. A patient with SARS who was breathing quietly but coughing occasionally in a hospital room contaminated the surrounding air with SARS-CoV, as shown by experiments conducted during the SARS outbreak in Canada in early 2003.",

However, the possibility of airborne dissemination of SARS-CoV has been controversial. The important work by Booth et al. has shown beyond doubt that SARS-CoV aerosol generation can occur from a patient with SARS. The study was well conceived and designed and employed nucleic acid amplification and state-of-the-art air slit-sampling technology. To ensure the accuracy of their results, the authors followed stringent control measures in their studies. For example, empty specimen containers made the same trip from outside to the hospital ward and then to the laboratory, in the same way as the real specimen containers. All samples were tested similarly, and the technologists were blinded to their true nature. These procedures helped to control for possible contamination of the outside of the specimen containers, a little-thought-of possible cause of false-positive test results. Another, even more stringent measure was the dedication of special rooms for these experiments. These researchers anticipated laboratory contamination as a possible cause of false-positive results long before news broke of SARS-CoV escaping microbiology laboratories through infection of workers [9, 10] .",

            "text": "Because none of the SARS-CoV cultures were found to be positive and host infection was not involved, the authors rightly avoided drawing a conclusion of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV. Definitive proof of transmission will need to come from experiments similar to those performed by Riley et al. in the 1950s, which involved exposure of guinea pigs to air shared by patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis [11] . In vitro viral culture tests may not be sensitive enough for this purpose. However, if SARS-CoV is naturally airborne (produced by breathing and coughing), as was shown by Booth et al., then there is sufficient concern that it can be transmitted successfully by air. A number of factors may affect the ability of a virus to establish infection after successful transmission. The lack of proofreading [12, 13] during SARS-CoV replication suggests that some assembled viral genomes are defective and not packaged within viral capsids to form infectious viral particles. Viability may also be compromised, even for nondefective viral particles, after release into the environment. Considerable airborne viral dilution may also occur, adding another challenge to a pathogen that employs air for dissemination. Finally, the number of viral particles needed to cause an infection differs among viral pathogens, with influenza virus requiring as few as 3 particles to cause infection [14] . It is not clear how many SARS-CoV particles are required to cause infection.",

Public health officials will also be more likely to recommend \"smart\" quarantine [16] and to provide point-of-care diagnostics. Avoiding crowding in the clinic is important in the prevention of nosocomial transmission of any infectious diseases, especially those spread by air.",
