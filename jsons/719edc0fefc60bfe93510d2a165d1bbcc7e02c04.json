A set of nonlinear differential equations is been used to explore the interactions between ecology and epidemiology. The model allows for frequency-dependent transmission of infection within host species, and density-dependent transmission between species, via the environment or a vector. Three examples are discussed. It is shown that removing a pathogen may increase a consumer population, decreasing its resource. It is then shown that the presence of a pathogen could enable a predator and a prey species to coexist. Finally the dilution effect, by which increasing biodiversity reduces the transmission of an infectious disease, is investigated.",

Adding structure to the community matrix produces a different picture [20] [21] [22] [23] , competitive interactions are stabilising, whereas mutualism is destabilising [20] . A major component of an ecosystem is the food web: the network of feeding interactions among species. Adding pathogens increases the web's complexity [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , and parasites have been described as the dominant or missing links [29, 30] . An infection may make prey easier to catch, or unpalatable to a predator, or reduce a predator's hunting ability, but the overall influence of pathogens on an ecosystem may be unexpected [31] . The influence of ecosystem dynamics on epidemiology can also be unexpected [32] and may lead to a pathogen jumping host species causing a pandemic.",
