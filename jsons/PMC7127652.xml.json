Using mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis, we confirmed that IL-10 is indeed produced by HBV-specific CD8 TE upon hepatocellular Ag recognition in vivo. To our surprise, IL-10 blockade ameliorated rather than worsened liver disease. Ex vivo analyses of HBV-specific CD8 TE isolated from the livers of HBV replication-competent transgenic mice or from the blood of acutely infected patients revealed that IL-10 acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to increase IL-2 responsiveness and rescue CD8 TE from Ag-induced apoptosis.",

We longitudinally analyzed the sera of a chimpanzee (A0A006) that had been inoculated with a monoclonal HBV inoculum of 1010 GE of HBV DNA, as described.13 Serum IL-10 was not detectable until CD8+ T cells accumulated in the liver and its appearance coincided with the onset of a necroinflammatory liver disease (Fig.1\nA), suggesting that this cytokine might have been produced by virus-specific CD8 TE upon hepatocellular Ag recognition. To test this hypothesis and to assess the role of IL-10 in liver immunopathology, we employed a well-established model of acute HBV pathogenesis, i.e. the adoptive transfer of HBV-specific CD8+ TE into HBV replication-competent transgenic mice.[14], [15], [16] Na\u00efve CD8+ T cells from HBV nucleocapsid (Cor)-specific TCR transgenic mice17 (referred to as Cor93 cells) were differentiated in vitro into bona fide CD8 TE. Upon intravenous injection of 107 Cor93 CD8 TE into HBV replication-competent transgenic mice, the hepatic mRNA expression of the il10 gene increased sharply, reaching peak levels at 4\u20138 h after T cell transfer and mirroring the kinetics of the prototypical CD8 TE-derived pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokine gene ifng (Fig.1B). Accordingly, IL-10 was also detected in the serum of these mice between 4 and 8 h after T cell transfer, again echoing the IFN-\u03b3 kinetics (Fig.1C). Consistent with the hypothesis that IL-10 is produced by CD8 TE upon hepatocellular antigen recognition, we found that Cor93 TE cells stimulated for 4 h in vitro with the cognate Cor93 peptide produced both cytokines (Fig.1D\u2013G; Fig. S1). Finally, to unambiguously identify the cellular source of the IL-10 detected in the liver of HBV replication-competent transgenic mice upon adoptive transfer of Cor93 CD8 TE, we genetically deleted the il10 gene in HBV replication-competent recipient mice, in Cor93 CD8 TE or in both. By using this approach, we could demonstrate that the transferred CD8 TE cells are the unique source of IL-10 in this experimental setting, as il10 expression was only detected when the transferred T cells were IL10-competent, regardless of the recipient genotype (Fig.1H).",

            "text": "To gain insight into the role of CD8 TE-derived IL-10 expression in liver immunopathology, we selectively blocked IL-10 receptor signaling by injecting HBV replication-competent transgenic mice with an anti-IL-10R\u03b1 Ab 2 h prior to Cor93 TE transfer. To our surprise, we found that IL-10 blockade decreased, rather than increased, liver damage by about 3-fold at the peak of the disease (Fig.2\nA). Of note, anti-IL-10R\u03b1 Ab injection did not affect the total number of circulating Cor93 TE cells (data not shown), indicating that this treatment did not deplete the transferred T cells. Also, anti-IL-10R\u03b1 Ab treatment significantly reduced liver disease when HBV envelope-specific TCR transgenic[16], [17] or polyclonal CD8 TE\n18 were injected into HBV replication-competent transgenic mice instead of Cor93 TE (data not shown). Moreover, consistent with IL-10 being produced exclusively by the transferred CD8 TE in this model, deletion of the il10 gene in HBV replication-competent recipient mice \u2013 which did not alter the Ag presentation capacity of hepatocytes (Fig. S2) \u2013 did not affect the severity of liver disease induced by Cor93 TE transfer (Fig.2B). To explore the mechanisms underlying this IL-10-mediated increase in liver immunopathology, we quantified the number, function and viability of intrahepatic Cor93 CD8 TE 2, 8, and 24 h after adoptive transfer into HBV replication-competent transgenic mice that were or were not subjected to anti-IL-10R\u03b1 Ab treatment. IL-10R blockade significantly decreased the number of total and IFN-\u03b3+ intrahepatic Cor93 CD8 TE cells recovered 24 h after injection (Fig.2C and D). We next addressed if this reflected an increase in cell death. Indeed, the percentage of intrahepatic Cor93 CD8 TE that underwent apoptosis at 8 and 24 h after transfer was significantly increased by IL-10R blockade (Fig.2E; Fig. S3), and this was reflected by a lower disease severity (Fig.2F and G). Although the number of intrahepatic Cor93 TE was reduced upon IL-10R blockade, these cells probably produced enough IFN-\u03b3 to abolish viral replication (Fig. S4).",

            "text": "To explore if CD8 TE-derived IL-10 directly decreased Ag-induced apoptosis, we exposed purified Cor93 CD8 TE to Ag in the presence or absence of IL-10R blockade or exogenous IL-10. As shown in Fig.3\nA, Ag exposure for 8 h triggered Cor93 CD8 TE apoptosis. Notably, IL-10R blockade increased the percentage of Cor93 CD8 TE that became apoptotic, whereas the addition of exogenous recombinant IL-10 decreased Cor93 CD8 TE apoptosis (Fig.3A and Fig. S5A). We next set out to determine the mechanism whereby IL-10 prevents CD8 TE from dying. Since IL-10 has been proposed to enhance the growth of activated CD8+ T cells in the presence of IL-2,[19], [20], [21] we reasoned that CD8 TE-derived IL-10 might increase IL-2 responsiveness by, for instance, modulating IL-2 receptor expression. Indeed, Ag-induced IL-2R\u03b1 (CD25) upregulation on CD8 TE was lower upon IL-10R blockade, whereas the addition of exogenous recombinant IL-10 increased CD25 upregulation (Fig.3B and Fig. S5B). Accordingly, blocking IL-10R signaling decreased the capacity of CD8 TE to respond to IL-2 (as assessed by STAT5 phosphorylation), and IL-10 treatment increased IL-2 sensitivity (Fig.3C; Fig. S5C). Finally, we explored whether the capacity of CD8 TE-derived IL-10 to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to rescue CD8 TE from Ag-triggered apoptosis was restricted to murine CD8 TE or it extended to HBV-specific CD8 TE isolated from acutely infected patients. To this end, PBMCs from 5 HLA-A201+ patients with acute hepatitis B, in whom HBV-specific CD8+ T cells can be specifically visualized by HBV-specific dextramers22 (Fig. S6), were stimulated with the cognate Cor18 peptide in the presence or absence of anti-IL-10R\u03b1 Abs or exogenous IL-10. The results mirrored those obtained with murine CD8 TE, in that IL-10R blockade increased Ag-induced apoptosis, whereas the addition of recombinant IL-10 partially rescued CD8 TE from cell death (Fig.3D).",
