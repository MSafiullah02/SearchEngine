Chest x-ray demonstrated small patchy opacities in the mid-left lung field and electrocardiogram was remarkable for normal sinus rhythm with a QTc interval of 449 milliseconds. He was started on hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, as well as azithromycin and ceftriaxone for communityacquired pneumonia. He received enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. His symptoms improved, he did not require supplemental oxygen, and was discharged on hospital day two. He presented to the emergency room (ER) three days later with difficulty bearing weight on his right leg. Laboratory testing did not reveal significant changes from prior admission. He had normal range of motion, the leg did not appear erythematous or swollen on physical examination and he was discharged from the ER. The possibility of a deep venous thrombosis was not considered. Approximately two weeks after initial hospital admission, he returned to the ER with worsening right leg pain, erythema, and edema. Pain was sharp in nature, exacerbated by movement, ten out of ten on the numeric pain scale. Acetaminophen did not ameliorate the pain. He was afebrile and saturating 96% on room air. Physical examination was remarkable for erythema of the right leg from mid-calf to thigh and tenderness to palpation. Distal pulses were intact. He was found to have an elevated D-dimer, and COVID-19 PCR was positive again J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Table 1) . Repeat chest x-ray was remarkable for worsening bilateral opacities. Duplex ultrasound of the right leg demonstrated an acute partially occlusive deep vein thrombosis within the common femoral and popliteal veins and acute occlusive clot in the gastrocnemius vein ( Figure 1) . He was started on therapeutic apixaban and IV vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam for possible overlying cellulitis. Further coagulation studies revealed a normal fibrinogen (313 mg/dL), and negative beta glycoprotein IgM/IgG, cardiolipin IgM/IgG and lupus anticoagulant.",
