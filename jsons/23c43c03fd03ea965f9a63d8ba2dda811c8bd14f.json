Considering the underlying bleeding disorder, human coagulation FVIII (Consipin, 400 IU) was administered as usual at home, but his myalgia complaint remained unchanged. The next day (20 January 2020), he felt fatigue and presented with repeated low-grade fever with chills, recurrent vomiting and anorexia. The patient suspected that he might have infections with some bacteria, so he took oral amoxicillin and Chinese traditional medicines for 2 days on his own. However, his symptoms did not improve substantially. He disclosed that his mother developed fever and dry cough prior to his onset of symptoms and her condition had continued to worsen. The other family members also developed fever later except for his 3-year-old son. He decided to seek medical treatment because of suspicion of COVID-19.",

According to the product information for oseltamivir and cefdinir, adverse events of bleeding are not described. It seems that his haemophilia may not impact his ability to receive antimicrobial treatment. Haemophilia affects individuals lifelong. In patients with haemophilia with bleeding or suspected bleeding, the immediate goal is to raise the factor activity to a level sufficient to achieve haemostasis. 8 They do know when they have to receive administration of replacement factor. Moreover, when other health risks emerge, early replacement therapy is often thought to be beneficial. In China, many have access to potent prescription drugs at home, resulting in a different regime at home than in the hospital. For example, as for discomfort with myalgia in limbs at the onset of COVID-19 in this case, it would be more likely the occurrence of bleeding events because of the underlying bleeding disorder rather than infection of unknown cause. This case may benefit from the administration of FVIII at the onset of COVID-19 that results in zero bleeding events. Moreover, home management with active monitoring is appropriate for mild infected cases with haemophilia when they are adequately isolated at home. Importantly, if clinical conditions deteriorate, the patient should promptly be hospitalized.",

Breath sounds were normal to auscultation. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and the CT images revealed ground glass opacities located in the right lower lobe of his lung. The laboratory results showed normal values of neutrophil count (2.52 \u00d7 10 9 /L), monocyte count (0.23 \u00d7 10 9 /L), haemoglobin (137 g/L) and platelet count (214 \u00d7 10 9 /L), but leukopenia (white blood cell count, 3.64 \u00d7 10 9 /L), lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.85 \u00d7 10 9 /L), elevated plasma C-reactive protein (CRP, 12.6 mg/L) and serum amyloid A (SAA, 37 mg/L). Oropharyngeal swab samples were negative for influenza A and B viral antigens. Nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 was reported later as positive using his oropharyngeal swab by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At this time point, dyspnoea developed while he increased his physical activity. However, the patient was not admitted to the hospital because of limited wards where only critically ill cases were allowed. Uncomplicated COVID-19 patients are managed as outpatients.Since he was confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (5 g/d) for 2 days in the outpatient clinic. After the infusion ended, he was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring for clinical condition online by the local community health workers. He further received oral administration of antiviral agents (oseltamivir), empiric antibiotic (cefdinir) and Chinese traditional medicines (Lianhua Qingwen capsules) for 6 days at home. On the 3rd day of treatment (day 7 of illness, 25 January 2020), the patient's appetite remarkably improved and other encountered symptoms resolved, including myalgia, vomiting and chills. On the 5th day of treatment (day 9 of illness, 27 January 2020), his body temperature returned to normal, but he reported that dry cough remained unchanged and chest pain developed in his right lung when breathing deeply. Dry cough, dyspnoea and chest pain alleviated gradually and vanished 2 weeks later. This patient never reported any hemoptysis. As of 10 March 2020, this case was asymptomatic and bleeding events did not increase more than usual during the follow-up period.",

The infection for this patient's case occurred in this period and despite the special feature of his underlying severe haemophilia A, his clinical course is typical among the susceptible populations in Wuhan. This patient's clinical history supports that the mode of transmission was likely person-to-person transmission. Adults of middle age and older are most likely to be affected while symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon. 3 Clinical features of this family conformed to the above characteristics. The most common features at the onset of COVID-19 were fever, fatigue, myalgia, anorexia, dry cough and dyspnoea. Pneumonia appeared to be the most frequent manifestation of infection, characterized by different degrees of lung involvement on chest imaging. 4 Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea",
