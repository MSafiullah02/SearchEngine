            "text": "The vertebrate immune system is equipped to deal with invading pathogens, whether by means of mechanical barriers such as the skin and other epithelial surfaces or by means of innate immunity. Innate immunity comprises the phagocytic and inflammatory systems, with phagocytes like macrophages and neutrophils, dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as soluble mediators such as cytokines and complement. Phagocytes are the immune system's first line of defense: they recognize, engulf, and clear the pathogen and are the main cellular component of the innate antibacterial response. NK cells can directly recognize and kill pathogen\u2010infected cells that fail to express MHC molecules and secrete cytokines that affect the immune response. NK cells are the main cellular effectors of the innate response against viruses. The complement system can lyse infected cells or simply coat the surface of the pathogen or pathogen\u2010derived material, resulting in its neutralization and opsonization. To counteract pathogen infection, host cells also have extracellular and intracellular pathogen recognition receptors to alert the immune system, such as toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) at the cell surface, and protein kinase R (PKR) and nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins in the cytosol (Akira 2006, Inohara 2005) that can detect pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial peptidoglycan or viral dsRNA. These \u201cdanger\u201d signals initiate the synthesis of cytokines like interferons to induce inflammation, a crucial component of the innate defense against pathogens. Because innate immunity is not always successful at recognizing or eliminating the infectious agents, a more sophisticated line of defense, adaptive immunity, is also in place.",

            "text": "The adaptive immune system includes cells originated in the thymus, the T lymphocytes, and the bone marrow\u2013derived B lymphocytes (B cells), DCs, and macrophages. The two subsets of T lymphocytes, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, possess distinct T cell receptors (TCRs), CD8 and CD4, respectively, that interact with their coreceptors on the surface of the target cell, the polymorphic class I and class II MHC molecules (Ploegh, 1998). Class I MHC molecules are expressed by nearly all nucleated cells, whereas class II MHC molecules are constitutively expressed only by professional antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages, B cells, and DCs. Class II MHC expression however, can be induced in many cells, in particular by IFN\u2010\u03b3 treatment. APCs can endocytose, process, and display antigen in the context of class II MHC products at their cell surface to activate CD4+ T cells. In the presence of antigen displayed by the APC and the appropriate lymphocyte costimulatory molecules, CD4+ T helper (TH) cells produce cytokines that \u201chelp\u201d activate other cells: TH1 (or inflammatory T cells) activate macrophages to kill the phagocytosed pathogens; TH2 cells (or helper T cells) trigger T and B cell proliferation and activate the B cell differentiation program into antibody\u2010producing plasma cells. Furthermore, activation of CD4+ TH cells is carefully regulated by a small subset of T cells, the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Regulatory T cells play an important role in downregulation of the host immune response, limiting the immunopathology resultant from antipathogen reactions, and preventing autoimmune disease (Beissert 2006, Mills 2004). In addition to making antibodies, B cells are a special kind of APCs. Unlike DCs and macrophages, B cells are not actively phagocytic. However, stimulation of the membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) antigen\u2010recognition component of their B cell receptor (BCR) with cognate antigen triggers the B cell to capture and deliver the antigen to class II MHC compartments, culminating with antigen presentation for activation of T cells. Bone marrow\u2013derived professional APCs include macrophages and DCs. Macrophages are phagocytic APCs with a low basal antigen\u2010presenting capacity\u2014owing to low surface expression of class II MHC and costimulatory molecules\u2014that is induced on macrophage activation, for instance, by IFN\u2010\u03b3. Macrophages reside in (or are recruited to) peripheral tissues, where they phagocytose and clear pathogens. Phagocytosis, in turn, induces release of proinflammatory cytokines like IFN\u2010\u03b3 that turn macrophages into potent APCs, resulting in initiation of CD4+ T cell activation.",

Mature DCs can also prime na\u00efve CD4+ T cells. Like resting macrophages, immature DCs have very low antigen\u2010presenting capability, and only on exposure to maturation signals [such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on bacterial surfaces] does internalized antigen get loaded into class II MHC products and get displayed at the cell surface to CD4+ T cells (Bryant 2004, Stockwin 2000). \u201cEducated\u201d (antigen\u2010specific) CD8+ T lymphocytes survey all cells in the body, ready to destroy any that displays signs of the presence of cellular alterations (such as viral and tumor peptides) within their surface class I MHC molecules (Andersen 2006, Castelli 2000).

Adding to the complexity of the immune system is the cross talk between innate and adaptive immunity, which is crucial in eliciting an effective immune response (Zingoni et al., 2005). As mentioned, phagocytes release cytokines that stimulate the adaptive response. Conversely, on activation by antigen recognition, T cells synthesize and secrete cytokines that activate macrophages, increasing their ability to kill ingested microbes, an innate immune response (Munz 2005, Salazar\u2010Mather 2003). The vertebrate immune system, therefore, is the appropriate battleground for microbial pathogens, selecting for those that devise successful strategies to avoid detection and elimination (Hilleman 2004, Ploegh 1998).",

            "text": "Intracellular pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to subvert host processes to ensure their own replication and transmission. The initial hurdle is entry into the host cell, which poses great challenges for avoiding immune detection before establishing infection. To promote entry into host cells without alerting the immune system, bacteria possess capsular surfaces that have evolved to minimize antibody and complement deposition while in circulation through the body. On the other hand, filamentous adhesins (like fimbriae and pili) that protrude through the bacteria's capsule enable binding to host cell receptors, which enables secretion systems to deliver bacterial effectors to modulate uptake and invasion (Finlay 2006, Galan 1999). Virus particles are very often coated with highly variable capsid (nonenveloped viruses) or envelope (enveloped viruses) proteins to avoid detection and clearance by antibody\u2010mediated responses. These capsids or envelopes can also be studded with immunomodulatory molecules of viral or even host origin and promote attachment to the host cell membrane, fusion and delivery of the virus internal core. Alternatively, they may act as signaling devices and induce intracellular cascades required for virus uptake. Ultimately, intracellular release of the viral DNA or RNA occurs (Marsh 2006, Skehel 2000). The establishment of an infection critically depends on bacterial and viral genes dedicated to manipulation of host functions. A number of reviews have covered the bacterial and viral genes involved in manipulation of the host immune system, from control of apoptosis, cytokine signaling, to the antibody response, so the reader is referred to Alcami 2003, Alcami 2000, Bowie 2004, Finlay 2006, Hengel 2005, Hilleman 2004, Tortorella 2000. For the purpose of this chapter, we will focus on pathogen manipulation of antigen presentation pathways and the Ub\u2010proteasome system.",

In a simplified view of antigen presentation, the class I and class II MHC pathways have evolved to sample different sources of antigen to which they have access: the class I MHC pathway usually deals with cytosolic antigens and is crucial for activation of CD8+ T cells, whereas the class II MHC pathway deals with exogenous antigens and the activation of CD4+ T cells (Bryant 2004, Cresswell 2005, Pamer 1998). Antigen presentation is, of course, not as simple and clear\u2010cut, as we shall discuss later. There are, however, common principles that apply to the discrete steps of antigen processing and presentation by class I and class II MHC molecules: antigen must be acquired, it is subjected to proteolysis, delivered to MHC+ compartments, and properly assembled with the MHC product. The complex is then subject to sorting through the secretory pathway and delivered to the cell surface (Fig. 1\n). Because each of these steps affords a target for interference by pathogens, we shall survey them for each pathway.",

The structure of the fully assembled complex and its interactions with antigen\u2010specific receptors on T cells have been extensively reviewed (Alam 1996, Rudolph 2002, von Boehmer 2006). The class I MHC HC is inserted into the ER membrane and N\u2010glycosylated and binds in its course of synthesis to the membrane\u2010associated chaperone calnexin (CNX), at which point folding and intrachain disulfide bond formation take place. Once dissociated from CNX, the HC binds its soluble partner subunit, \u03b22m, and enters the peptide\u2010loading complex (PLC). The PLC is composed of two MHC\u2010encoded components, TAP and tapasin, and two \u201chousekeeping\u201d ER proteins, calreticulin and ERp57. The transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) is an ATP\u2010dependent pump with two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2 that transports peptides into the ER. Tapasin, a transmembrane glycoprotein, mediates the interaction between the TAP transporter and peptide\u2010free HC/\u03b22m dimers. The soluble calreticulin and ERp57, a chaperone and a thiol oxidoreductase, respectively, normally involved in folding of nascent glycoproteins, promote assembly of the class I MHC complex. The peptide antigen cargo for class I MHC originates from proteasomal proteolysis in the cytosol. The array of proteasome\u2010generated peptides is subject to trimming by cytosolic endopeptidases and delivered to the ER lumen by the TAP transporter. Further trimming by ER\u2010resident endopeptidases can also occur to guarantee a custom\u2010fit of the peptide antigens, typically 8\u201310 amino acids long, into the peptide\u2010binding groove on the HC/\u03b22m dimer associated with the PLC. Empty HC molecules are detained in the ER by virtue of interaction with tapasin, until assembly with \u03b22m and peptide takes place, at which point the HC/\u03b22m/peptide trimeric complex is released from the PLC and allowed to exit the ER and enter the secretory pathway. Once displayed at the cell surface, the antigen\u2010loaded class I MHC complex is ready for inspection by the T cell receptor (TCR) on circulating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Cresswell 2005, Heemels 1995, Rammensee 2002, Rammensee 2004).",

Because of the intrinsic error\u2010prone nature of protein synthesis and folding, a sizable fraction of translation products (estimated at up to \u223c30%) may never result in a finished product. These defective ribosomal products (DRIPs) are destroyed within 30 min of their synthesis by the cytosolic proteasomal pathway and enter the class I MHC antigen presentation pathway (Yewdell et al., 2001). In tumor cells or cells infected by a virus, mutated forms of endogenous proteins or viral proteins will compete with the host's own proteins for presentation by class I MHC products. As \u201cnon\u2010self\u201d (tumor\u2010 or virus\u2010derived) peptides displayed in the context of class I MHC products accumulate at the cell surface, their chance of triggering activation of CD8+ T cells with a cognate receptor increases. The activated cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes will then lyse the target cell by releasing perforin and granzymes or by Fas ligand engagement. Secretion of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) also aids in elimination of infected and tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (Andersen 2006, Castelli 2000).",

There is, however, a backup system for when lack of class I MHC expression impairs the CD8+ T cell cytotoxic response: NK cells. NK cells display both activating and inhibitory receptors at their surface, which recognize different ligands at the surface of target cells. NK cell activity is ultimately determined by the integration of signals that are perceived by the NK cell surface receptors (Lanier, 2005). All NK cells express at least one inhibitory receptor, which engages class I MHC molecules on the surface of the target cell, resulting in downregulation of NK cell effector functions. Low levels or absence of class I MHC products on the surface of the target cell relieve the inhibitory signals and lead to NK cell cytotoxicity, resulting in clearance of the virus\u2010infected or tumor cells. NK cell recognition has been extensively revised and the reader is referred to Backstrom 2004, Kumar 2005, Lanier 2005.",

All mammalian cells internalize their own cell surface proteins by constitutive endocytosis. In class II MHC+ cells, this allows class II MHC access to self\u2010proteins as a source of peptides. Professional APCs, such as B cells, macrophages, and DCs, also engage in receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis to acquire extracellular antigen: the antigen from the extracellular milieu is bound by cell surface receptors, internalized, and delivered to the class II MHC antigen processing machinery. Antibodies, complement system factors, and common bacterial or viral components that coat the surface of pathogens or their toxic products bind receptors on APCs that allow them to recognize and internalize this foreign material. Of the many receptors used by professional APCs for this purpose, the mannose receptor, which recognizes mannose residues and glycoproteins on viral and bacterial products, and the scavenger receptor, which recognizes very promiscuously many different classes of macromolecules, are among the most important. Professional APCs also have complement receptors and receptors for the Fc region of antibodies, the Fc receptors, which can assist in the acquisition of opsonized antigen and in its delivery to the proper intracellular destination. B cells can also use their surface immunoglobulin or BCR, to acquire antigen (Bryant 2004, Cresswell 1994, Kim 2006c).",

            "text": "Class II MHC loading with antigenic peptides takes place mostly in the endocytic vesicles of professional APCs. Class II MHC \u03b1\u03b2 dimers assemble in the ER and associate with the chaperone invariant chain (Ii), which inserts its class II MHC\u2010associated Ii peptide (CLIP) portion in the peptide\u2010binding groove of the \u03b1\u03b2 dimer, preventing its premature (prelysosomal) loading. Ii is also important for correct assembly and transport of class II MHC in the endocytic pathway. Further class II MHC maturation and peptide loading takes place in acidified compartments of the endolysosomal pathway of APCs, since low pH favors an \u201copen\u201d conformation of the class II MHC molecule and hence peptide exchange, as well as the action of specific cysteine proteases that displace Ii from the class II MHC\u2013Ii complex, and that of the class II MHC\u2010like molecule HLA\u2010DM which facilitates peptide loading. The many hydrolase activities present in the endolysosomal compartments of APCs, such as the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), numerous cysteine proteases of the cathepsin (Cat) family, like CatB, CatS, CatL, and asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP), produce the peptide ligands that are loaded onto class II MHC products. Peptides bound by class II MHC molecules are usually 13\u201325 residues long. The end result is a mature class II MHC\u2013peptide complex at the cell surface, consisting of a class II MHC \u03b1\u03b2 dimer loaded with peptide, which interacts with the TCR on CD4+ T cells. The result of this interaction is dependent on class II MHC\u2013TCR contacts and also on the context provided by lymphocyte costimulatory molecules at the immunological synapse. The CD4+ T cell response may be cytolytic, but generally these antigen\u2010specific CD4+ T lymphocytes function as helper cells, releasing cytokines to enhance the overall immune response by inducing macrophage activation, T and B cell proliferation, and B cell differentiation to produce antigen\u2010specific antibodies and different immunoglobulin isotypes with different effector functions (Bryant 2004, Chapman 2006, Cresswell 1994, Honey 2003, Hsing 2005, Stern 2006, Villadangos 1999).",

Since the discovery of Ub and Ub\u2010dependent proteolysis in the late 1970s, it has become increasingly clear that the Ub\u2010proteasome system is pivotal to numerous cellular processes: cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, antigen presentation and induction of the inflammatory response, degradation from the ER, membrane trafficking, receptor endocytosis and downregulation, apoptosis, and development (Hershko 1992, Pickart 2001).",

            "text": "Ubiquitin is a small 76\u2010amino acid protein, synthesized as a precursor that is processed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) to expose the glycine\u2013glycine sequence at the Ub C\u2010terminus, its site of attachment to target molecules. ATP\u2010dependent Ub activation is catalyzed by the E1 (Ub\u2010activating) enzyme, which adenylates the Ub C\u2010terminus, allowing the subsequent formation of a high\u2010energy thioester bond between the glycine residue of Ub and the cysteine residue on the E1 active site. Ub is then transferred from the E1 cysteinyl side chain to a cysteinyl group on one of several E2 (Ub\u2010conjugating) enzymes. Finally, one of hundreds of E3 (Ub\u2010ligase) enzymes, binds the Ub\u2013E2 complex and the substrate, thus facilitating the transfer of Ub to a lysine residue in the substrate via an amide (isopeptide) bond (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992). The functions of E3 ligases, in particular, are tightly regulated by signal\u2010induced mechanisms, such as localization, oligomerization, degradation, and posttranslational modifications, which makes E3s the master orchestrators of specificity in the Ub conjugation cascade. This multistep mechanism, much like phosphorylation, endows protein ubiquitination with a high degree of specificity and flexibility, which is paramount to its important biological functions (Haglund 2005, Hershko 1998, Pickart 2001, Pickart 2004, Varshavsky 2005) (Fig. 2A\n).",

            "text": "We elaborate on Ub E3 ligases to some extent, as they are key players in several aspects of the immune system, including immune evasion (Liu, 2004) and also in ER quality control and degradation (Hirsch 2004, Kostova 2003, Romisch 2005), that yields to some of the ligands on class I MHC products. E3 ligases can be divided into two broad classes: the homologous to E6\u2010AP carboxyl terminus (HECT)\u2010domain ligases or the really interesting new gene (RING)\u2010like domain ligases. The first HECT E3 described, E6\u2010associated protein (E6\u2010AP), was shown to be required for ubiquitination and degradation of p53, mediated by the human papillomavirus protein E6 (Scheffner et al., 1993). In HECT E3s, Ub is transferred from the E2 to a conserved cysteine residue in the HECT domain, followed by attack of this thioester by a lysine on the substrate (Pickart, 2001). The RING\u2010CH domain is a ring finger motif with a cysteine residue in the fourth zinc\u2010coordinating position and a histidine residue in the fifth. RING\u2010type E3s are more abundant and do not form an obligatory thioester intermediate with Ub; rather they bring the Ub\u2010loaded E2s and the substrate into proximity, thus facilitating the Ub transfer from the E2 to the substrate (Pickart, 2001). RING\u2010type E3s can be single subunit E3s, which have both a RING\u2010finger domain and substrate recruitment domain(s) on the same protein, like MDM2, a key regulator of p53. Multisubunit E3s include the very diverse Cullin\u2010RING ligases (CRLs) (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005). CRLs are composed of a catalytic core that recruits the Ub\u2010loaded E2\u2014formed by a nucleating Cullin protein and a RING finger protein\u2014as well as a substrate recognition complex. The archetypal CRLs are the Skp\u20101\u2010Cullin\u20101\u2010F\u2010box protein complexes or SCF E3s. The Cullin subunit (any one of Cullin\u20101, \u20102, \u20103, \u20104A, \u20104B, \u20105, or \u20107) forms an elongated bent backbone for the multisubunit ligase. The Cullin N\u2010terminus binds the S\u2010phase kinase\u2010related protein\u20101 (Skp\u20101), an adaptor that recruits any one of a number of substrate\u2010specific adaptor subunits called F\u2010box proteins. The F\u2010box protein is the main determinant in substrate specificity, as it binds the substrate through its particular substrate recognition domain (Jin et al., 2004a), although the RING box protein may participate (Jin and Harper, 2002). The Cullin N\u2010terminus binds the catalytic core composed of the RING\u2010box (Rbx) protein with its associated Ub\u2010loaded E2 (Zheng et al., 2002). This arrangement allows the F\u2010box protein to bring its bound substrate close to the ubiquitination machinery of the complex (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of the substrate very often regulates the F\u2010box protein\u2013substrate interaction, converting the substrate into a form susceptible to E3 activity, adding an extra layer of control to the process (Joazeiro 2000, Schulman 2000, Zheng 2002).",

            "text": "CRLs assemble with numerous substrate receptors. Cullins 2 and 5, for example, recruit substrates through suppressor of cytokine signaling/elongin\u2010BC (SOCS/BC) boxes and form the so\u2010called SCF2s and SCF5s complexes. In SCF2s and SCF5s, Skp\u20101 is substituted by the Skp\u20101\u2010like protein elongin C which binds the Ub\u2010like elongin B that binds the substrate adaptor subunit (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005). Many of these E3 complexes have important roles in the immune system (Liu 2004, Liu 2005). The nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) transcription factor is a master organizer of both innate and adaptive immunity. NF\u2010\u03baB is activated in response to TLR signaling on recognition of pathogen\u2010associated molecules like bacterial peptidoglycan (Liu et al., 2005) in a process that is crucially dependent on ubiquitination. One of the steps requires the cytosolic SCF\u03b2\u2010TrCP E3 complex. The SCF\u03b2\u2010TrCP substrate adaptor component is the F\u2010box protein \u03b2\u2010transducin repeat\u2010containing protein (\u03b2\u2010TrCP) that possesses WD repeats that bind to phosphorylated inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB (I\u03baB), inducing its ubiquitination and degradation. NF\u2010\u03baB is thus released from the IkB\u2010NF\u2010\u03baB dimer and translocates into the nucleus, activating downstream transcription. The elongin\u2010C\u2010elongin\u2010B\u2010Cullin\u20105\u2010SOCS (ECS) complex uses SOCS proteins as the substrate adaptors. SOCS boxes bind Janus kinases (JAKs), which are recruited and activated in response to IFN and cytokine signaling, promoting ubiquitination and degradation of JAKs by the ECS complex. This, in turn, inhibits phosphorylation and activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors that are crucial for the immune response following IFN and cytokine signaling and following viral infections (Liu et al., 2005). There are other families of E3s with noncanonical RING\u2010domains, like the K3 homologues and the Ufd2\u2010homologous box (U\u2010box) E3s (which we discuss in more detail later). For a more comprehensive review of HECT and RING E3s and different classifications read (Ardley 2005, Coscoy 2003, Hatakeyama 2001, Petroski 2005, Sharrocks 2006).",

Chain length and linkage type also influence the outcome of the Ub\u2010conjugated substrate. The multiple Ub moieties in a polyUb chain (chains of 4 or more Ub moieties) are linked to one another by an isopeptide bond between a lysine residue on one Ub molecule (usually on Lys48) and the C\u2010terminal carboxyl group of the next Ub on the chain. At times, extension of a polyUb chain on a substrate conjugated with 1\u20133 \u201cinitiator\u201d Ub moieties requires a special subclass of E3s, the UFD2\u2010homology box (U\u2010box) E3s (once called E4s) (Hoppe, 2005). Targeting of proteins for proteasomal proteolysis generally requires polyubiquitination in a lysine (Lys) 48\u2010type linkage. By contrast to polyUb, substrate monoubiquitination or attachment of noncanonical Ub chains\u2014Ub chains with non\u2010Lys48 linkages such as Lys63 and Lys29 linkages\u2014usually have nonproteolytic functions in DNA repair, endocytosis, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and ribosomal function (d'd'Azzo 2005, Pickart 2004).",

            "text": "Monoubiquitination can occur on a single lysine residue or on several lysine residues in a substrate (multiubiquitination). Monoubiquitination is extremely important as a sorting signal in the endocytic pathway. For example, monoUb attachment is sufficient to induce endocytosis of growth hormone receptor and sorting to the lysosome for degradation (Hicke 2001, Hicke 2003). Direct modification of the cargo (cis\u2010regulation) or modification of the protein\u2010trafficking machinery (trans\u2010regulation) by monoUb could have many consequences for antigen presentation, as these processes rely heavily on events that take place in endolysosomal compartments. Noncanonical ubiquitin chains play many diverse roles in signaling pathways, in DNA replication and postreplication DNA repair, and modulating protein\u2013protein interactions. For instance, activation of NF\u2010\u03baB is tightly regulated by a balance between Lys48\u2010 and Lys63\u2010mediated ubiquitination of different components of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. Triggering of many cell\u2010surface receptors leads to assembly of signaling complexes that recruit tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2010associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ligase that binds UBC13, promoting Lys63\u2010linked polyubiquitination of the \u03b3 subunit of the inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, IKK\u03b3. This leads to activation of the IKK complex, which in turn results in IkB phosphorylation. Phosho\u2010IkB then recruits the SCF complex that catalyzes Lys48\u2010linked polyubiquitination of IkB and consequently activates NF\u2010\u03baB (Karin and Ben\u2010Neriah, 2000).

There are about 100 DUBs in the human genome, organized in five classes according to their catalytic domain structure: the ubiquitin\u2010specific proteases (USPs), the ubiquitin C\u2010terminal hydrolases (UCHs), the Machado\u2010Joseph disease proteases (MJDs), the ovarian tumor proteases (OTUs), and the JAB1/MPN/Mov34 proteases (JAMMs). The first four classes comprise cysteine\u2010type proteases, whereas JAMMs are metalloproteases. For a more detailed inventory of DUBs, read Nijman et al. (2005). DUBs have very diverse specificity properties, in terms of the ubiquitin or Ubl moiety itself (substrate specificity), in terms of the target protein to which the Ub or Ubl is attached (target specificity), and possibly in terms of the context provided by target and attached modification. DUB specificity in vivo can be further regulated by subcellular localization or association with different binding partners (Amerik 2004, Li 2003, Reyes\u2010Turcu 2006, Soboleva 2004). DUB functions are therefore also extremely diverse, ranging from regulation of proteasome function, to regulation of chromatin structure, to membrane protein trafficking, and with obvious implications in processes such as cancer and neurodegeneration (Amerik 2004, Nijman 2005, Soboleva 2004).",

The \u03b2 subunits, which line the proteasome's inner cavity, carry out the catalytic activity. For mammalian proteasomes, only three of the seven \u03b2 subunits in each ring are catalytically active. Access to this cavity occurs through narrow pores (with a diameter on the order of 10\u201315 \u00c5) at both ends of the barrel, so it is usually assumed that protein substrates must be unfolded prior to their delivery to the catalytic chamber (Groll 2000, Groll 1997, Kohler 2001). Also at both ends of the core particle there is the 19S cap complex, whose functions range from recognition of poly\u2010Ub chains on target proteins, to unfolding of the substrate to facilitate entry into the catalytic cavity, to deubiquitination activity (Adams 2003, Heinemeyer 2004, Rivett 1997, Schmidt 2005, Seeger 1997).",

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, the proteasome plays an instrumental role in class I MHC antigen presentation and activation of peptide\u2010specific CD8+ T cell responses. This process requires not only generation of peptides of the right quality\u2014that is, right size and sequence to allow a correct fit into the peptide\u2010binding cleft\u2014but also in the right quantity to trigger a successful response, which is no small endeavor due to many destructive aminopeptidase activities in the cytosol (Shastri 2005, Strehl 2005). IFN\u2010\u03b3, a crucial component of the innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses, affords the immune system a competitive edge. IFN\u2010\u03b3 induces expression of auxiliary \u03b2 subunits, \u03b21i, \u03b25i, and \u03b22i [also known as low molecular weight protein 2 (LMP2), LMP7 and multicatalytic endopeptidase\u2010like complex 1 (MECL1), respectively], as well as synthesis of the proteasome activator PA28, and of the proteasome maturation protein (POMP) (Strehl et al., 2005). The immunosubunits LMP2, LMP7, and MECL1 are incorporated into nascent proteasomes, replacing their endogenous counterparts and constituting the so\u2010called immunoproteasome. The proteasome activator PA28 (or 11S proteasome) binds to the outer rings of the 20S proteasome, thereby opening the central gate and facilitating substrate entry. POMP is important for assembly and maturation of the proteasome (Strehl et al., 2005). This IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced proteolytic cascade, mediated by immunoproteasomes and PA28, might be induced to respond to a demand for high proteasome activity when the constitutive cascade is no longer sufficient, altering the proteolytic activity of the proteasome for maximal efficiency in production of the class I MHC peptide repertoire. IFN\u2010\u03b3 treatment also activates a transcriptional program that increases the synthesis of class I MHC molecules themselves and that of components of the peptide\u2010loading complex, thus increasing cell surface presentation (Kloetzel 2004, Kloetzel 2004, Kruger 2003, Rivett 2004, Van den Eynde 2001). Therefore, even though class I MHC presentation is constitutive, it can be modulated in the course of an immune response, with a proposed role in the early stages of a cytotoxic response. It is thus not surprising that viruses have targeted the IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling cascade so aggressively (Alcami 2000, Hengel 2005, Salazar\u2010Mather 2006).",

            "text": "Although tightly controlled, ER protein synthesis is not always successful. Proteins may sustain damage or fail to complete their synthesis early during biogenesis, or be trapped in an irreversible nonnative conformation, or a mutation may result in a structural alteration that leads to misfolding, as is the case for the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) (Jensen 1995, Ward 1995), mutant plasma \u03b11\u2010antitrypsin (Teckman and Perlmutter, 1996), or tyrosinase (Halaban et al., 2000). They may also be expressed in the absence of their cognate subunits, as is the case for unassembled subunits of TCR\u03b1 (Huppa 1997, Yang 1998). ER quality control is a homeostatic process that involves an elaborate machinery that recognizes and retains newly synthesized misfolded or misassembled proteins and targets many of them for degradation by the Ub\u2010proteasome system (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003). This mode of degradation therefore samples sets of proteins otherwise targeted to extracellular space, where the degradation products are available as peptide ligands for class II MHC products. In addition to its role in ER quality control, this ER\u2010associated degradation (ERAD) can also be employed in the physiological regulated proteolysis of normal ER proteins whose degradation is subject to metabolic cues, such as hydroxymethylglutaryl\u2010coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) (Hampton 2002, Hampton 1997).",

Dislocation is a complicated multistep process that involves substrate recognition, targeting for dislocation, removal from the ER membrane, deglycosylation, ubiquitination, and finally proteolysis (Kostova 2003, Meusser 2005, Romisch 2005). The proteasome is usually considered to be a nonselective degradation apparatus, with selection of ERAD substrates being mediated mostly by the Ub ligases. However, the ER quality control E3 enzymes are mostly cytosolic or membrane\u2010associated and thus are separated from their substrates at least by the ER membrane. This invokes the existence of mechanisms, present in E3 ligases themselves or in upstream factors, which facilitate coupling of ERAD substrate recognition to ubiquitination by E3 ligases in the cytoplasm.",

Terminally misfolded proteins\u2014that is, proteins that after extensive CXN/CRT cycle folding attempts still fail to acquire their native conformation\u2014are trimmed by ER mannosidase I, leading to recognition by ER degradation\u2010enhancing alpha\u2010mannosidase\u2010like protein (EDEM), which presumably targets them for degradation (Eriksson 2004, Jakob 2001, Molinari 2003). Most ER lumenal proteins require the lumenal chaperone BiP for degradation, while transmembrane proteins with large cytosolic domains usually rely on cytosolic chaperone systems, like the heat shock protein (HSP) complexes Hsp70/Hsp90 and Hsp40/Hsp70 (Ellgaard 2003, Romisch 2005). Yet it appears that a protein's lumenal or ER membrane localization matters less than the localization of the folding alteration within the polypeptide itself. CFTR whose cytoplasmic domains are recognized first by the Hsp70/Hsp90 cytoplasmic chaperone system may be targeted for degradation by the cytosolic Hsp70/Hsp90\u2010interacting CHIP E3 ligase cochaperone (Connell 2001, Murata 2001), even if the protein also has a misfolded lumenal domain (which might also target it to a BiP\u2010dependent degradation pathway). If the cytoplasmic domain is properly folded, then the lumenal domains are inspected, and if then the protein is recognized as misfolded, it is degraded in a process that involves BiP (Connell 2001, Meacham 2001, Vashist 2004). This suggests that ER quality control uses sequential checkpoints to select degradation substrates and target them to the appropriate degradation pathway.",

            "text": "In the case of nonglycosylated substrates, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), one of a large number of ER\u2010resident oxidoreductases that catalyze disulfide bond formation and isomerization, can play a role in ER quality control by unfolding certain substrates prior to degradation. Another oxidoreductase, ERp57, interacts with CNX and CRT to facilitate folding, but in the event of a terminally misfolded protein may aid in transfer of proteins with improper disulfide bonds to the EDEM pathway (Hirsch et al., 2004). Another possibility, at least in yeast, is that misfolded proteins actually escape to the Golgi and are then recycled to the ER (Taxis 2002, Vashist 2001). This ER\u2013Golgi shuttling model was proposed because mutations in several secretory pathway genes (like Ufe1p, Sec23p, and Erv29p) compromise degradation of ERAD substrates (Taxis 2002, Vashist 2001), invoking a functional secretory pathway for efficient degradation of misfolded proteins from the ER. The Golgi apparatus could presumably endow misfolded proteins with a signal for destruction, but such a modification has not been found. Since the Ufe1p and Sec23p have since been shown to be required for maintenance of proper ER structure (Prinz et al., 2000), the effects on protein degradation may simply be pleiotropic consequences of perturbing the normal arquitecture of the ER (Hammond 1994, Romisch 2005). Ubiquitination at the ER membrane is yet another mode of ERAD substrate selection.",

An E3 ligase can recruit distinct E2 Ub\u2010conjugating enzymes and/or distinct adaptor proteins (as we have seen for the SCF and ECS E3 complexes and will discuss later for ERAD E3s), thus conferring specificity in substrate selection. The yeast Hrd1p/Der3p E3 ligase was first discovered in a genetic screen for Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in HMG\u2010CoA reductase degradation (Hrp) (Hampton et al., 1996) and is an ER\u2010resident protein with six predicted transmembrane domains and a C\u2010terminal RING\u2010finger motif facing the cytosol. Hrd1p can act in a complex with Ubc7p and Ubc6p to ubiquitinate substrate proteins (Fig. 2B). Ubc7p is a soluble protein that becomes active only when tethered to the ER membrane by the Ubc7p cofactor Cue1p membrane protein. Degradation of transcription factor Mat\u03b12\u201310 protein (Doa10p) is a transmembrane protein of the ER/nuclear envelope, which participates in yeast ERAD (Swanson et al., 2001). Doa10p is predicted to span the membrane 14 times (Kreft et al., 2006) and, like Hrd1p, uses Cue1p/Ubc7p and Ubc6p to ubiquitinate its substrates (Fig. 2B). However, the two ligases target different sets of substrates for degradation (Bays 2001, Swanson 2001).",

Hrd3p is a single\u2010spanning ER membrane protein with a large ER luminal domain that can recognize misfolded proteins, thus possibly functioning as a substrate recruitment factor for the Hrd1p ligase complex (Gauss et al., 2006). The degradation from the ER\u20101 protein (Der1p) spans the ER membrane four times and is required for degradation of some misfolded glycoproteins (Knop et al., 1996). Der1p may function as a substrate adaptor protein or even as a channel for ejection of degradation substrates from the ER membrane. Hrd3p can associate with Der1p, presumably enabling substrate delivery to downstream components. Hrd3p can even regulate Hrd1p activity, which is necessary for substrate extraction from the membrane and delivery to the proteasome (Gauss et al., 2006) (Fig. 3\n). These multifunctional protein complexes can therefore function in substrate selection in the ER lumen or membrane and even facilitate subsequent steps that lead to proteasomal degradation. Similarly, Doa10p can catalyze ubiquitination of both membrane and soluble proteins, yet the mechanisms of subsequent proteasome targeting differ (Ravid et al., 2006), presumably due to association with other regulatory proteins. The many layers of E3\u2010mediated regulation of ERAD substrate selection are most likely just emerging.",

HRD1 may associate with UBC7 to catalyze ubiquitination of a subset of substrates, like TCR\u03b1 and CD3\u03b4. HRD1 is not involved in the regulated degradation of the mammalian HMGR (Kikkert et al., 2004). HRD1 may also associate with SEL1L, a homologue of Hrd3p, as well as other ER membrane and ER membrane\u2010associated proteins, including Cdc48p(p97)/NPL4/UFD1, forming multisubunit complexes that seem to coordinate steps that range from substrate selection to delivery to the proteasome for at least a subset of ER degradation substrates (Lilley 2005a, Ye 2005). gp78 was identified as the tumor autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) (Nabi et al., 1992) and later as an E3 ligase due to its homology to Hrd1p and involvement in degradation of CD3\u03b4 and apoliprotein B100 (Fang 2001, Liang 2003). gp78 is an ER\u2010resident protein, predicted to span the membrane five times, with a C\u2010terminal cytosolic RING\u2010domain and an additional UBC7 E2\u2010binding site, the Cue domain, arranged in tandem. While Hrd1p recruits UBC7 through the transmembrane Cue1p protein, it seems that convergent evolution has made the E3\u2010 and the E2\u2010docking protein come together in a single human protein.

The F\u2010box proteins Fbs1 and Fbs2 bind high mannose N\u2010linked glycoproteins (Winston et al., 1999). By using Fbs1/Fbs2 as its substrate adaptor(s), the cytosolic SCFFbs1,Fbs2 E3 ligase is rendered specific for glycoproteins that have been dislocated from the ER (Yoshida 2002, Yoshida 2003) (Fig. 4A\n). The CHIP U\u2010box E3 ligase which is involved in the degradation of CFTR (Meacham et al., 2001) and glucocorticoid hormone receptor (Meacham et al., 2001), can be \u201cmanipulated\u201d to function in ER glycoprotein turnover. CHIP usually serves as a cochaperone for the cytosolic heat shock protein Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone system. The CHIP N\u2010terminal TPR motif recruits Hsp chaperones loaded with misfolded proteins, whereas its C\u2010terminal U\u2010box RING domain recruits E2 enzymes (Murata et al., 2003) (Fig. 4B), effectively linking protein folding with ubiquitination. The CHIP E3 ligase activity can be directed to ER glycoprotein turnover by binding to Fbs2 (Nelson et al., 2006), through an interaction between its TPR motif and a PEST motif in Fbs2 (Fig. 4C). N\u2010linked glycans can, therefore, function in ER quality control not only to regulate ER retention in the folding cycle, but also to function in ERAD substrate selection and ubiquitination, adding an additional layer of complexity and specificity to glycoprotein quality control (Nelson 2006, Yoshida 2003).",

The extent to which Sec61 is involved in ER dislocation or the identity of the \u201cdislocon\u201d are not without controversy, and the search for a dislocation channel(s) is a subject of intense research (Meusser 2005, Romisch 2005).",

Like their yeast homologue, Derlins 1, 2, and 3 are tetraspanning ER membrane proteins that can homo\u2010 and heteroligomerize and could presumably form higher order structures with channel\u2010like properties (Lilley 2004, Ye 2004). Conclusive evidence for a role of Derlin\u20101 as a channel is still unavailable, and in any case, Derlin\u20101 is unlikely to be the only channel, as turnover of some ERAD substrates does not rely on Derlin\u20101 function (Kreft 2006, Lilley 2004). Derlins 2 and 3 are obvious candidates that could function in place of Derlin\u20101. Alternatively, Derlins may act to deliver a particular substrate to a channel/another adaptor in its cognate dislocation pathway. In fact, Derlins form a large, multiprotein complex with p97 and the Hrd1p and Hrd3p mammalian homologues HRD1 and SEL1L, respectively (Lilley 2005a, Ye 2005), suggesting a very intimate connection between substrate recognition, export through the membrane, ubiquitination, and extraction into the cytoplasm. The existence of such a complex that would integrate all of these different functions, including formation of a channel or dislocon, would offer obvious advantages in terms of control of both specificity and directionality of the dislocation process. We shall return to this substrate \u201cguidance\u201d theme.",

Cdc48p/p97 is an essential protein of the AAA ATPase (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) family, conserved from archaea to mammals, whose functions include mitotic spindle disassembly, membrane traffic and fusion, nucleic acid repair and replication, and Ub\u2010proteasome degradation (Woodman, 2003). Cdc48p/p97 is a motor protein that generates energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis; it forms a homohexameric barrel structure, with each subunit containing two AAA domains that contain the Walker motifs essential for ATPase activity, and the 6 subunits arranged in a ring with a pore in the center (Zhang et al., 2000).",

P97 can recognize denatured proteins nonspecifically (Thoms, 2002) and has an affinity for polyubiquitin chains (Ye et al., 2003). When complexed with the polyUb\u2010binding Ufd1p and Npl4p, Cdc48p/p97 activity is directed to ER degradation (Ye et al., 2001). Both in yeast and in mammals, the trimeric Cdc48p(p97)/NPL4/UFD1 complex is proposed to function in a postubiquitination, preproteasomal step (Bays 2002, Jarosch 2002), in one of two fashions: the ATP\u2010hydrolytic activity of the AAA ATPase p97 may provide the driving force to extract substrates through the ER membrane, or may be required to liberate already dislocated substrates from the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (Braun 2002, Flierman 2003, Hirsch 2004, Kostova 2003, Meusser 2005). The proteasome presumably interacts with the ER membrane (Hirsch and Ploegh, 2000), either directly or through a receptor that docks the proteasome to the ER membrane, perhaps Sec61 (Kalies et al., 2005). Notwithstanding, the Cdc48p(p97)/NPL4/UFD1 complex or other accessory factors might aid substrate feeding to the proteasome (Hartmann\u2010Petersen 2004a, Richly 2005).",

The yeast Ub regulatory X domain\u2010containing Ubx2p/Sel1p protein, an integral ER membrane protein, was recently shown to recruit the Cdc48p/Npl4p/Ufd1p complex to the ER membrane, thereby facilitating the transfer of polyubiquitinated substrates from the E3 ligases Hrd1p and Doa10p to Cdc48/p97 (Neuber 2005, Schuberth 2005). These dual function Ub\u2010binding factors effectively serve as bridges between the p97/NPL4/UFD1 complex and the proteasome. As more of these Ub\u2010 and proteasome\u2010binding proteins are discovered (Buschhorn 2004, Decottignies 2004, Medicherla 2004, Mullally 2006), a \u201cguidance\u201d model, in which ERAD substrates are escorted from a dislocation channel to the proteasome by a cascade of Ub\u2010binding factors, gains strength (Hartmann\u2010Petersen 2004b, Hartmann\u2010Petersen 2003, Hendil 2004, Richly 2005).",

In fact, it seems Cdc48p/p97 may even be capable influencing substrate fate (Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006). Cdc48p/p97 can simultaneously bind Ufd2p, a U\u2010box E3 that catalyzes polyubiquitin chain extension, and one of two factors that can counteract its action: Otu1p, a DUB, and Ufd3p protein, a WD40 repeat protein of unknown function that has been shown to be required for Ub\u2010dependent proteolysis (Ghislain 1996, Johnson 1995). Otu1p can disassemble the polyUb chains, whereas Ufd3p competes with Ufd2p for the same docking site on Cdc48p/p97. Presumably, Cdc48p/p97 can selectively recruit different substrate processing cofactors and thus tip the balance toward substrate degradation or release from the degradation cascade (Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006), suggesting a very tight regulation of proteasomal proteolysis. These aspects are important not only to understand how these pathways contribute to class I MHC\u2013peptide epitope presentation, but also how viruses manipulate these routes to avoid detection.",

Both in yeast and mammals, there is generally a tightly knit relationship between PNGase and the proteasome: PNGase interacts with (at least) the S4 and S5 subunits of the mammalian 19S proteasome and the Ub\u2010binding factor Rad23p (HR23B in mammals), which seems to recognize only deglycosylated degradation substrates (Katiyar et al., 2004). This suggests that misfolded protein substrates may first be deglycosylated by ER\u2010associated or free PNGase, then identified by the HR23B adaptor protein, and subsequently targeted to the nearby proteasome (Katiyar et al., 2004). Mammalian PNGase also associates with the ER membrane gp78 E3 ligase and the cytosolic p97 and Y33K, a UBA/UBX domain protein (Li et al., 2006a). A gp78\u2010Y33K\u2010p97\u2010PNGase\u2010HR23B complex could therefore be formed that recruits PNGase to the cytosolic face of the ER membrane that couples the activities of dislocation, ubiquitination, and deglycosylation and escorts misfolded glycoproteins to the proteasome (Kim 2006a, Li 2005, Li 2006).",

Prolonged latency periods (a dormant state with minimal production of viral proteins and absence of viral progeny) and controlled sporadic reactivation ensure transmission to a new host, and thus survival of both host and virus. Perturbation of this delicate balance leads to life\u2010threatening infections in immunocompromised patients, transplant recipients and infected newborns and illustrates how the outcome of this host\u2013virus relationship is dependent on viral manipulation of the host immune response (Hengel 1998, Klenerman 2005). The several HCMV\u2010encoded immunoevasins (Jones et al., 1995) are presumably aimed primarily, but not solely, at control of the CD8+ T cell and NK cell responses (Falk 2002, Mocarski 2004, Pinto 2005, Yewdell 2002). Here we will discuss the HCMV immunoevasins that interfere with class I MHC antigen presentation, US3, US6, US10, US2, US11, UL16, UL18, UL40, UL141, and UL142. In light of our most recent findings, we will elaborate on the mechanism of ER dislocation co\u2010opted by the HCMV US2 and US11 immunoevasins. More specifically, we discuss the similarities and the differences between the two cellular ERAD pathways that US2 and US11 have allowed us to uncover and the possible implications for ER dislocation. We will extend this by comparing the HCMV US2\u2010 and US11\u2010mediated dislocation of human class I MHC HC molecules with dislocation of murine HCs by the MHV\u201068 mK3 immunoevasin.",

            "text": "If one goes back to the steps we depicted for antigen presentation (Fig. 1) and then examines the immunoevasins encoded by HCMV, we will find that this herpesvirus exploits many aspects of the antigen presentation pathway thus defined. The HCMV phosphoprotein pp65 tegument protein mediates the phosphorylation of the HCMV immediate early antigen\u20101 (IE\u20101) during HCMV infection. Phosphorylation of IE\u20101 interferes with the presentation of IE\u20101\u2010derived antigens (Gilbert et al., 1996). The US3 protein binds to and retains some class I MHC locus products in the ER membrane (Ahn 1996, Jones 1996). US3 is a type I membrane glycoprotein with an Ig\u2010like lumenal domain that is essential for its own retention, albeit transient, in the ER (Lee et al., 2003). US3 eventually travels to the lysosome where it is degraded (Gruhler et al., 2000). Some evidence suggests that ER retention of class I MHC complexes by US3 depends on the ER localization signal on US3 and perhaps the ability of the US3 luminal domain to oligomerize (Misaghi et al., 2004b) as determinants of retention of both molecules (Lee et al., 2003). Another model suggests that association of US3 with tapasin, which inhibits tapasin, is sufficient to mediate ER retention (Park et al., 2004). Class I MHC alleles that require peptide optimization by tapasin may be retained in the ER, whereas tapasin\u2010independent locus MHC products are spared from retention. In fact, there is a perfect correlation between tapasin\u2010dependence and US3 sensitivity (Park et al., 2004). Both mechanisms, tapasin inhibition and direct binding, may be in place, perhaps allowing US3 to retain a larger repertoire of class I MHC locus products.",

The US6 luminal domain oligomerizes and may form a bridge between the TAP 1 and TAP 2 subunits to effectively block TAP activity (Halenius et al., 2006). US10 delays trafficking of class I MHC HCs and stalls them in the ER; although the block is not absolute and the mechanism is poorly characterized, US10 expression results in downregulation of class I MHC from the cell surface (Furman et al., 2002a). US2 and US11 catalyze destruction of class I MHC HCs from the ER membrane by targeting them to the Ub\u2010proteasome system (Wiertz 1996a, Wiertz 1996b), a process we discuss in detail in a later section. Expression of each individual immunoevasin results in reduction of cell surface expression of class I MHC peptide\u2010loaded complexes and evasion of CD8+ T cell\u2010mediated lysis (Ahn 1996, Jones 1995).",

            "text": "Besides CD8+ T cell recognition, HCMV can frustrate NK cell recognition (Orange et al., 2002). Protection of HCMV from NK cell\u2010mediated lysis can be mediated by several immunoevasins, HCMV UL16, UL40, UL18, UL141, UL142, and pp65 (Lodoen 2005, Orange 2002, Rajagopalan 2005, Reyburn 1997, Wills 2005). The activating receptor NKG2D on the NK cell recognizes divergent families of class I MHC\u2010related ligands, like the MIC and ULBP products. HCMV UL16 retains the ULBP 1, ULBP 2, and MIC\u2010B NKG2D ligands in the ERGIC compartment of the target cell, preventing NKG2D recognition and thus NK cell activation (Dunn et al., 2003). HCMV UL141 and pp65 act at the level of the NK effector cell rather than the APC. The result is, nevertheless, the same: prevention of NK cell activation. UL141 downregulates the NK cell\u2010activating receptors CD226 (DNAM\u20101) and CD96 (TACTILE) (Tomasec et al., 2005). The pp65 tegument protein engages the activating receptor NKp30 and antagonizes its effects, dampening NK cell\u2010mediated cytotoxicity. How a tegument protein gains access to the receptor on the NK cell is unknown, but pp65 engagement of the NKp30 receptor causes dissociation of a receptor\u2010associated signaling module (Orange et al., 2002), disrupting the activating signaling pathway that would lead to NK cell activation (Arnon et al., 2005).",

The killer cell immunoglobulin\u2010like receptor (KIR) genes encode a family of activating and inhibitory receptors that recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\u2010A, \u2010B, and \u2010C. The CD94/NKG2 receptors recognize the nonclassical class I MHC molecule HLA\u2010E. HLA\u2010E presents fragments derived from the signal sequences of classical class I MHC molecules, which delivers an inhibitory signal to CD94/NKG2 receptors on NK cells. UL40 encodes a peptide whose sequence is exactly homologous to the HLA\u2010E binding leader peptide from HLA\u2010C locus products. UL40 therefore loads HLA\u2010E and maintains HLA\u2010E on infected cells (Tomasec 2000, Ulbrecht 2000) even when other class I MHC products are downregulated. UL18 encodes a class I MHC\u2010like molecule that engages the inhibitory CD85j/LIR\u20101/ILT\u20102 receptor on the NK cell, thus inhibiting NK cell effector functions (Cosman 1997, Reyburn 1997).",

            "text": "However, UL18 and UL40 expression may be insufficient to confer target cell protection (Falk 2002, Leong 1998). UL18 and UL40 may, in fact, be more relevant for control of viral infection by T cells, with HLA\u2010E\u2010restricted CD8+ T cells playing a role in lysis of cells expressing UL40, and non\u2010MHC\u2010restricted CD8+ T cells playing a role in lysis of UL18\u2010positive cells (Pietra 2003, Romagnani 2004, Saverino 2004). CD85j is an invariant receptor expressed by many T cells and responsible for transduction of inhibitory signals that downregulate antigen\u2010specific T cell functions (Merlo 2001, Saverino 2000). CD85j interaction with UL18 on CD8+ T cells occurs in a TCR\u2010independent manner and leads to activation (not inhibition) of non\u2010MHC\u2010restricted CD8+ T cells (Saverino et al., 2004). This expands the repertoire of T cell activation mechanisms and is probably a viral strategy of ensuring survival of the host, by allowing some level of protection from the initial wave of NK cell\u2010mediated antiviral response. In vivo HCMV\u2010infected APCs are faced with multiple immunoevasins displaying allelic preferences and expression patterns that are both spatially and temporally regulated. The many immunoevasins expressed by HCMV are thus likely to have both synergistic and antagonistic interactions (Ahn 1996, Farrell 2000, Klenerman 2005, Mocarski 2004, Reddehase 2002, Yewdell 2002), as has been experimentally verified for murine cytomegalovirus (Wagner et al., 2002).",

The viral proteins appropriate this cellular quality control process to extract (dislocate) class I MHC HCs from the ER membrane. On arrival in the cytoplasm, the dislocated HC molecules are destroyed by the proteasome; destruction of the HC component of the class I MHC complex by US2 and US11 abolishes cell\u2010surface expression of class I MHC complexes and, consequently, presentation of viral peptides to CD8+ T cells, allowing HCMV to remain undetected (Wiertz 1996a, Wiertz 1996b).",

The US11 transmembrane domain (TMD) is crucial for US11 function: more specifically, mutation of a polar amino acid, glutamine (Q) 192, within the US11 TMD to a hydrophobic leucine (L) residue renders this US11 Q192L mutant inactive in dislocating HCs from the ER membrane. In a screen for proteins that interact specifically with the active version of US11, work from our laboratory showed that the aforementioned Derlins, the mammalian Der1p homologues, are involved in HC dislocation mediated by US11, but not by US2 (Lilley and Ploegh, 2004). The fact that the dislocation mechanism used by US2 is not dependent on the Derlins prompted us to investigate what other ERAD pathway is being co\u2010opted by the HCMV US2 immunoevasin and allowed us to uncover an unexpected ERAD player.",

The US2 tail is essential for dislocation: US2186, a cytosolic tail deletion mutant of US2, is dislocation incompetent (Furman et al., 2002b). By using an affinity purification approach similar to that used for US11 (Lilley and Ploegh, 2004), signal peptide peptidase (SPP) was found as a specific interacting partner for dislocation\u2010competent (active) US2 (Loureiro et al., 2006), an interaction that relies solely on the presence of the highly hydrophobic US2 tail. More importantly, reduction of SPP levels by RNA interference led to inhibition of class I MHC HC dislocation and to the discovery of SPP as a necessary factor for the US2\u2010mediated ER dislocation pathway.",

These proteases are characterized by the ability to cleave substrate polypeptides within a transmembrane region and by possessing two active site aspartate (D) residues (italicized) within the conserved motifs YD and LGLGD in adjacent membrane\u2010spanning regions (Martoglio 2003, Wang 2006a, Weihofen 2002). There are seven related members of the PS/SPPL superfamily in the human genome: PS\u20101, PS\u20102, SPP and four SPP\u2010Like proteins, SPP2a, SPP2b, and SPP2c, and SPP3 (Martoglio and Golde, 2003). Presenilins 1 and 2 are the catalytic components of \u03b3\u2010secretase, a tetrameric complex containing PS and three other subunits. PSs play a role in processing of the \u03b2\u2010amyloid precursor protein (APP) into A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, peptides that constitute the principal components of the \u03b2\u2010amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD); PSs are also required for development due to processing of the Notch receptor by \u03b3\u2010secretase (Selkoe and Kopan, 2003) and might be involved in intracellular trafficking (Sisodia 2002, Wang 2006c). The function of the four SPP\u2010like proteins is, at this point, unknown, but the role of intramembrane\u2010cleaving proteases is usually to liberate signaling molecules from membrane\u2010bound precursors with consequent activation or repression of signaling cascades (Fortini 2002, Kopan 2004, Martoglio 2003, Parent 2005, Xia 2003).",

On insertion of secretory or type II membrane proteins into the ER, their signal sequence is cleaved by the ER luminal protein signal peptidase, leaving the signal peptide anchored in the ER membrane. The ER membrane\u2013anchored signal peptide is subsequently cleaved by the intramembrane\u2010cleaving SPP within the transmembrane region. The resulting signal peptide fragments are released into the cytosol (N\u2010terminal portion) or into the ER lumen (C\u2010terminal portion). The latter peptides may easily bind to class I MHC molecules in the ER lumen. The HLA\u2010A2 molecule, for instance, is known to bind signal sequence\u2010derived peptides. The N\u2010terminal signal sequence fragments are TAP\u2010transported into the ER lumen and bind to HLA\u2010E (Lemberg et al., 2001). By presenting fragments derived from the signal sequences of classical class I MHC molecules, HLA\u2010E monitors the presence of classical class I MHC molecules. This is, as we discussed earlier, of crucial importance for NK cell recognition.",

            "text": "SPP is involved in processing of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein (McLauchlan et al., 2002). HCV is a single\u2010stranded RNA virus with a single open reading frame encoding a large polyprotein. The N\u2010terminal portion of the HCV polyprotein encodes the structural components of the HCV virion, the core protein (thought to constitute the virion capsid), and the E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins. The mature structural components of the HCV virion are produced through a series of cleavage events catalyzed by cellular proteases. The core protein is the most N\u2010terminal portion of the polyprotein and is followed by the signal sequence of the E1 envelope glycoprotein. The E1 signal sequence targets the polyprotein to the ER membrane and induces translocation of E1 into the ER lumen. Cleavage by signal peptidase liberates the N\u2010terminal end of E1, leaving the core protein anchored (by the E1 signal peptide) in the ER membrane. SPP\u2010mediated intramembrane proteolysis of the E1 signal sequence then results in release of the HCV core protein from the ER membrane, thus freeing the mature core protein for incorporation into lipid droplets (Martoglio and Golde, 2003). SPP\u2010mediated HCV core protein maturation and trafficking to lipid droplets and the outer mitochondrial membrane may be critical for viral assembly and life cycle (Ait\u2010Goughoulte et al., 2006) and may also affect cellular lipid metabolism and apoptosis, as HCV core protein\u2010transgenic mice display liver pathologies, mitochondrial injury, and enhanced oxidative stress (Chou 2005, Korenaga 2005, Meyer 2005, Okuda 2002, Omura 2005, Schwer 2004, Suzuki 2005). SPP\u2010mediated cleavage of the HCV core protein may thus modulate these important cellular functions of HCV.",

A characteristic feature of a signal sequence is its tripartite structure: a polar N\u2010terminal n\u2010region, a hydrophobic core (h\u2010region) of 7\u201315 residues, and a polar C\u2010terminal c\u2010region that contains the consensus sequence for signal peptide cleavage (von Heijne, 1985). The n\u2010region of most signal sequences comprises only a few residues. However, some signal sequences have extended n\u2010regions of up to 150 residues. The function of such long n\u2010regions is not known. Both the p\u2010Prl and the gp160 signal sequence have an extended basic n\u2010region that can potentially form a basic amphiphilic alpha\u2010helix, a feature of CaM\u2010binding domains (O'Neil and DeGrado, 1990), not found in the majority of signal sequences. SPP\u2010mediated cleavage releases this CaM\u2010binding domain on the N\u2010terminal fragment of the p\u2010Prl and gp160 signal peptides into the cytosol. The functional and physiological significance of an interaction between the p\u2010Prl and p\u2010gp160 signal peptide fragments that are released into the cytosol and calmodulin (CaM) could be due to a regulatory function of the signal peptide fragments. CaM\u2010dependent processes could be enhanced or inhibited depending on the amounts of CaM\u2010binding signal peptide fragments generated and released into the cytosol (Martoglio et al., 1997).",

US2\u2010mediated dislocation of class I MHC HC molecules presents the first functional evidence of such a role for the intramembrane\u2010cleaving protease SPP. The US2 tail is necessary and sufficient to recruit SPP, and structural predictions suggest that the US2 tail suggests may adopt a 310 helical conformation that could form a protein\u2013protein interaction domain (Oresic et al., 2006). SPP is crucial for dislocation by US2, as reduction of its levels by RNA interference blocks HC degradation. The question remains as to the detailed mechanism of its involvement.",

This would imply a cleavage event during dislocation, such as within the TMD of US2 or HC or another factor, unknown at this point; a postcleavage function of one of these protein fragments could play a regulatory role in the process. SPP\u2010mediated intramembrane proteolysis requires, among other things, a membrane protein substrate to have access to its catalytic core in a type II orientation (Lemberg 2002, Martoglio 2003). Both US2 and HC are type I membrane glycoproteins, so the topology of their transmembrane and tail segments is opposite to that of predicted SPP substrates. SPP\u2010mediated intramembrane cleavage within the HC TMD is inconsistent with the observed recovery of full length HC in the dislocation reaction (Blom 2004, Misaghi 2004a, Wiertz 1996a, Wiertz 1996b). For US2, while a suggested protein\u2013protein interaction domain in the US2 tail (Oresic et al., 2006) may mediate binding to SPP, intramembrane cleavage of the US2 TMD by SPP in this inverted orientation would presumably not occur, as seen for other proteases (Roques 1983, Tarasova 2005). However, the proposed bent\u2010helix conformation on the US2 tail (Oresic et al., 2006) might allow US2 to conform to the requirements for SPP cleavage. Whether SPP\u2010mediated US2 cleavage takes place is unknown at this point. One can speculate that this putative processing of US2 by SPP, as for the HCV core protein (McLauchlan et al., 2002), could be necessary for \u201cmaturation\u201d of US2 into a dislocation\u2010active form. Binding of US2 to SPP could still modulate SPP enzymatic activity and thus affect dislocation. The possibility remains that SPP mediates cleavage in trans of an unidentified factor whose function is important. Experiments with SPP inhibitors and catalytic mutants of SPP should allow an assessment of the contribution of the proteolytic properties of SPP to dislocation.",

            "text": "The involvement of SPP need not be related to its catalytic activity. Substrate recruitment and subsequent cleavage by SPP may be separable events, as shown for the related PS (Kornilova 2003, Lemberg 2004). Some intracellular cleavage products of \u03b3\u2010secretase are proposed to be intermediates that are destined for degradation (Kopan 2004, Parent 2005). \u03b3\u2010secretase\u2010mediated cleavage of a large number of type I transmembrane proteins releases their C\u2010terminal fragments (CTFs). PS1 deficiency causes delayed turnover and subsequent accumulation of some \u03b3\u2010secretase substrates as full\u2010length proteins (Esselens 2004, Wang 2006c, Wilson 2004), suggesting cleavage of the CTFs as a prelude to degradation. Treatment with \u03b3\u2010secretase inhibitors, however, does not phenocopy PS deficiency (Wang et al., 2006c), suggesting that this effect is independent of \u03b3\u2010secretase activity. Therefore, SPP may be crucial for HC dislocation irrespectively of its catalytic properties. Binding of US2 to SPP could presumably modify the SPP structure in a way that affects dislocation. Alternatively, recruitment of SPP by US2 could perhaps nucleate assembly of a dislocation complex, much like US11 and the Derlins (Lilley and Ploegh, 2005a). SPP may be a component of an ERAD pathway for a subset of ER degradation substrates that includes misfolded transmembrane proteins, such as truncated opsin (Crawshaw et al., 2004), and that is recruited by US2 to dislocate HC (Fig. 6, A arrow\n). Experiments to address the identity of SPP\u2010associated proteins may prove informative.",

It is tempting to speculate that our observations extend the connection from regulated intramembrane proteolysis to a direct involvement in ER dislocation. An involvement of SPP with the UPR is also a possibility. Cells deficient for the X\u2010box binding protein\u20101 transcription factor (XBP\u20101) show upregulated levels of SPP transcripts (Shaffer et al., 2004), but this aspect of the process remains to be explored. Although removal of signal peptide remnants from the ER membrane, assigned to SPP in animals and plants, is not a function exclusive to higher eukaryotes, a gene that encodes an orthologue of this enzyme is absent from the yeast genome (Martoglio 2003, Weihofen 2002). The role of SPP in higher eukaryotes might therefore not be limited to signal peptide processing but extend to processes such as protein dislocation from the ER. PS and the other SPP\u2010like members of the PS/SPPL superfamily of intramembrane\u2010cleaving aspartic proteases, so far of unknown function (Martoglio and Golde, 2003), and some of which may not reside in the ER (Krawitz et al., 2005), may likewise be involved in disposal of different degradation substrates. HCMV might just be exploiting a cellular degradation pathway that involves intramembrane\u2010cleaving proteases for disposal of class I MHC HC.",

The US2 TMD may be involved in further engagement of SPP (SPP\u2010mediated cleavage or otherwise) (Fig. 6, B arrow), or alternatively, in the recruitment or engagement of other protein(s) involved in dislocation (Fig. 6, C arrow). ER membrane E3s or their adaptor subunits are likely candidates. SPP is most certainly not the sole host\u2010derived component of the US2 dislocation pathway, and a putative multiprotein complex (cascade of adaptor proteins) analogous to that found for US11 is likely to be found that evokes many (complicated) links between the ERAD machineries at the level of the ER membrane and the cytosol.

As we mentioned earlier, US2 and US11 have different allele and substrate folding, assembly, and ubiquitination requirements. Derlin\u20101 is crucial for US11\u2010 but not US2\u2010mediated dislocation of HCs (Lilley 2004, Ye 2004), and, conversely, SPP is required by US2 but not by US11 (Loureiro et al., 2006). This suggests that the HCMV immunoevasins US2 and US11 are targeting HC molecules to distinct ER dislocation pathways, perhaps by serving as adaptor molecules aiding in recruitment and/or assembly of distinct multiprotein complexes at the ER membrane (Lilley 2004, Lilley 2005b).",

MHV\u201068 mK3 belongs to a family of structurally related molecules, the K3 homologues, which have E3 ligase activity. K3 homologues are present in several different \u03b3\u2010herpesviruses and poxviruses (Coscoy 2000, Ishido 2000, Mansouri 2003, Stevenson 2000). All K3 homologues possess a noncanonical RING\u2010finger domain with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity [also called a plant homeodomain (PHD) or leukemia\u2010associated protein (LAP) domain], and a conserved integral membrane topology, with the transmembrane domains and cytosolic C\u2010terminal tails mediating interaction with the substrate (Coscoy and Ganem, 2003). The mK3 PHD/LAP\u2010family E3 is a type III ER membrane protein with the PHD/LAP RING\u2010related domain facing the cytosol (Boname 2001, Sanchez 2002). mK3\u2010mediated degradation of murine HCs is absolutely dependent on components of the PLC: association of mK3 with TAP and tapasin presumably imposes the necessary proximity and/or orientation of the mK3 RING domain that allows mK3 to specifically ubiquitinate class I MHC HC as they enter the PLC (Lybarger 2005, Wang 2004, Wang 2005).",

In a sense, it appears that mK3 may be a more evolved immunoevasin that can couple the ability to recruit other components of the dislocation machinery, like US11 and presumably US2, with E3 ligase activity, in one viral polypeptide. There are several mammalian K3 homologues, the membrane\u2010anchored RING\u2010CH (MARCH) proteins (Bartee 2004, Goto 2003), which are likely to be the cellular ancestors of MHV\u201068 mK3.",

In fact, like mK3, HCMV US2 and US11 also induce ubiquitination\u2010dependent degradation of class I MHC molecules in a cytosolic tail lysine\u2010independent fashion (Furman 2003, Shamu 1999). How, then, does mK3 access the luminal domain of HC molecules and trigger its ubiquitination? Access of the HC lumenal domain to the cytosol would invoke a \u201cpartial dislocation\u201d model that has been proposed for HCMV US2 and US11 (Furman 2003, Shamu 1999): the HC luminal domain must begin to emerge in the cytosolic face of the ER so ubiquitination can take place. This would mean that the trigger for dislocation would reside upstream from tail ubiquitination. An alternative explanation would be that the class I MHC tail lysine mutant HC molecules are dislocated as a \u201cbystander effect\u201d of dislocation of wild type molecules by mK3, simply because they are in the proximity of the dislocation machinery that has been recruited by the viral protein for the wild type HC clientele.",

The mechanisms used by US2, US11, and mK3, however, when analyzed in detail, are strikingly different. For instance, the stage of class I MHC HC biosynthesis that is targeted by each viral protein is distinct: US11 is the most promiscuous, targeting multiple class I MHC assembly intermediates, whereas US2 targets only properly folded class I MHC complexes and mK3 targets predominantly incompletely assembled HC while in association with the peptide\u2010loading complex. The main difference resides in the fact that mK3 encompasses ubiquitination activity (by means of its RING domain), substrate selection (by means of its association with the peptide\u2010loading complex), and recruitment of ER membrane and cytosolic factors necessary for dislocation (like Derlin\u20101 and p97) all in one polypeptide. HCMV US2 and US11 do not possess E3 ligase activity and possess no obvious sequence similarity with known genes/proteins that would hint at their function. However, at least US11, and presumably also US2, are still able to induce assembly of a dislocation complex (Fig. 7\n) that encompasses all the necessary ERAD activities.",

US2 uses its cytosolic tail to recruit SPP and its TMD for an additional step (so far unknown) also critical for HC dislocation (Loureiro et al., 2006), presumably resulting in recruitment of US2\u2010specific\u2010components of the ER dislocation machinery. The mechanism by which US2 operates will hopefully be clarified as we continue characterizing the structural and host cofactor requirements for its function in dislocation. The mechanistic details of dislocation catalyzed by the HCMV US2 and US11 and the MHV\u201068 mK3 immunoevasins must be quite diverse and their study will most certainly keep providing new insights into ER dislocation.

Immunoevasins aimed at interfering with class II MHC antigen presentation are not expected to block presentation of exogenous antigens to CD4+ T cells, unless the APC is infected by the virus (Yewdell and Hill, 2002). Class II MHC expression can, however, be modulated by IFN and receptor signaling through the CIITA transcription factor (Boss and Jensen, 2003). There are relatively few examples of viruses and bacteria that directly infect APCs and affect IFN\u2010induced class II MHC expression or directly interfere with class II MHC\u2010restricted antigen presentation (Hmama 1998, Hussain 1999, Miller 1998, Rinaldo 1994, Schuller 1998, Srisatjaluk 2002, Zhong 1999). It is likely that more examples will be found as this important question is being revisited. For viruses that do not infect professional APCs, the route to avoiding helper T cell and antibody\u2010mediated responses is to interfere with activation of CD4+ T cells by APCs. In this section, we present an overview of some of the mechanisms used mostly by viral pathogens to actively subvert class II MHC antigen presentation (Fig. 8\n). The degree to which other pathogens, like bacteria and parasites, actively interfere with class II MHC antigen presentation, by encoding \u201cimmunoevasins\u201d rather than passively, due to their residence in endocytic compartments, is difficult to discern.",

Nef induces a reduction of surface levels of peptide\u2010loaded class II MHC as well as a strong accumulation of surface\u2010displayed immature class II MHC complexes, still containing (and thereby blocked by) intact invariant chain (Ii). Nef expression results in accumulation of both class II MHC and invariant chain (Ii) in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Stumptner\u2010Cuvelette et al., 2003). MVBs are a specialized type of endosome that constitutes a major pathway of delivery of transmembrane proteins for lysosomal degradation (Hurley and Emr, 2006). Sequestering in MVBs suggests a reduced capacity of immature class II MHC complexes to reach lysosomes, either due to a defect in class II MHC sorting to the lysosomes or due to slower internalization of immature complexes.

This effect of US2, however, was only seen in cell lines in which induction of class II MHC was induced by stable transfection with the class II MHC trans\u2010activator (CIITA), but not in human DCs or several other cell lines, which express class II MHC endogenously (Rehm et al., 2002). Presumably the relative expression levels of class II MHC and/or US2 could account for the observed differences, and in fact, in CIITA\u2010transfected cells, even US3 was seen to downregulate class II MHC molecules (Hegde et al., 2002). HSV\u20101 can downregulate surface expression of class II MHC complexes in B cells and inhibits the ability of B cells to stimulate CD4+ T cells. HSV\u20101 inhibits synthesis of Ii and also encodes an envelope glycoprotein B (gB) that binds both HLA\u2010DR and HLA\u2010DM (Neumann 2003, Sievers 2002). By binding to HLA\u2010DR, gB affects trafficking of the molecule in the secretory pathway and by binding HLA\u2010DM it sequesters this peptide editor and thus prevents peptide loading of class II MHC molecules that may have escaped (Neumann et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The CD4 protein serves as the primary cellular receptor for HIV at the surface of CD4+ cells. However, its presence inhibits virus budding and interferes with incorporation of the gp120 protein into the budding virion, not to mention its crucial role in eliciting of a CD4+ T cell response (Keppler 2006, Lama 1999, Ross 1999). Not surprisingly, three HIV\u20101 proteins, Nef, Vpu, and gp160 dramatically reduce the steady state levels of CD4 on the cell surface (Mangasarian 1999, Piguet 1999a, Piguet 1999b). One of the many mechanisms used by Nef involves acceleration of the constitutive endocytosis of CD4. In T cells, CD4 is stabilized at the cell surface by p56Lck, a Src\u2010family tyrosine kinase, which binds a dileucine motif in the CD4 cytoplasmic tail, preventing CD4 from being recruited into clathrin\u2010coated pits (Aiken 1994, Jin 2005). Nef can displace Lck by directly binding a dileucine sorting motif in the CD4 tail, overcoming the normal Lck phosphorylation\u2010dependent route of CD4 downregulation. Nef itself contains a C\u2010terminal dileucine motif that recruits a subunit of the tetrameric adaptor protein complex\u20102 (AP\u20102), a component of clathrin\u2010coated pits at the cell membrane. Thus, Nef connects CD4 to AP\u20102 on clathrin\u2010coated pits, triggering rapid CD4 endocytosis (Jin 2004b, Jin 2005, Mangasarian 1999, Piguet 1998, Piguet 1999a). Nef can bind not only the AP\u20102 components of clathrin\u2010coated pits, but also the regulatory V1H subunit of the vacuolar proton (H+) ATPase. V1H (also called NBP1 or Nef binding protein\u20101) binds AP\u20102 in clathrin\u2010coated vesicles. By binding V1H, Nef strengthens its weak direct interaction with AP\u20102 (Geyer 2002, Mandic 2001). Again, by binding both CD4 (using the aforementioned dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail) and V1H, Nef directs internalization of CD4 from the cell surface.",

COP\u2010I\u2010coated vesicles are mostly subject to retrograde transport within the Golgi and between the Golgi and the ER, but some are involved in transport from early to late endosomes (McMahon and Mills, 2004), and thus association of Nef with ARF1 and \u03b2COP mediates targeting of CD4 for lysosomal degradation (Faure et al., 2004). Nef has a preference for AP\u20101 and AP\u20103 complexes in vitro (Janvier et al., 2003b), suggesting that the Nef modus operandi is mostly at the level of endosomal membranes.

In the absence of CD4, HIV gp160 is posttranslationally cleaved into its gp120 and gp41 subunits at the level of the ER\u2010to\u2010Golgi compartment (ERGIC).

Furthermore, each of these mechanisms may be more far\u2010reaching than downregulation of each individual receptor. For instance, by directly associating with the proton (H+) ATPase, which is required for the acidification of lysosomes, Nef not only downregulates CD4 but may also interfere with the pH of class II MHC\u2010positive compartments, affecting antigen processing by lysosomal proteases and class II MHC antigen presentation. This strategy is used by other pathogens: the E5 protein from both human and bovine papillomavirus (Andresson et al., 1995) and the VacA toxin secreted by Helicobacter pylori (Molinari et al., 1998) actively manipulate acidification in the endocytic pathway, resulting in impaired CD4+ T cell\u2010mediated responses (Brodsky et al., 1999). By binding to AP complexes or to the small GTPase ARF1, Nef may interfere with trafficking and alter the fate of numerous host molecules in the endocytic pathway (Janvier et al., 2003a), affecting aspects that range from viral replication to modulation of the immune system (Lama 2000, Sol\u2010Foulon 2002, Swigut 2001).",

Many events at the initial stage of infection, entry into the cell, are controlled by signaling pathways\u2014for instance, those involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements or in receptor engagement\u2014that rely heavily on the Ub\u2010proteasome system. The same is true for signaling cascades involved in cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. Not surprisingly, pathogens have devoted much energy and coding capacity to interfere with cell signaling events through interference with the Ub\u2010proteasome system. An illustrative example is that of tumor viruses and degradation of cellular tumor suppressor proteins, like the retinoblastoma protein or p53, often resulting in malignant transformation (Shackelford and Pagano, 2005). There have been a number of recent reviews on viral interference with signaling pathways, so we will not describe this aspect in detail here.

As mentioned in the first section of this chapter, proteasome\u2010mediated degradation of cytoplasmic proteins as well as the proteolytic events in the endolysosomal system are important for class I and class II MHC presentation and cross\u2010presentation. Mounting of an immune response involves complicated signaling cascades like NF\u2010\u03baB and JAK/STAT signaling, which are heavily dependent on the Ub\u2010proteasome system, and that can be manipulated from early events of cell\u2010surface receptor\u2010mediated signaling, for example, to later events of ubiquitination and deubiquitination of downstream targets. Certainly, because of the central role of the Ub\u2010proteasome system in many different aspects of cellular physiology, interference with this pathway will have pleiotropic effects, and which of the observed effects predominates may be difficult to discern.",

The EBNA\u20101 protein contains an internal repeat exclusively composed of glycines and alanines, the Gly\u2010Ala repeat, which not only interferes with its own proteasomal proteolysis (Levitskaya et al., 1995), but also reduces its rate of translation, blocking viral DRIPs formation and inhibiting the presentation of EBNA\u20101 class I MHC\u2010restricted T cell epitopes (Yin et al., 2003). A single residue change in the mouse leukemia virus (MuLV)\u2010derived CTL epitope (from KSPWFTTL to RSPWFTTL) can eliminate the proteolytic cleavage site required for its presentation (Ossendorp et al., 1996). As discussed earlier, phosphorylation of the HCMV IE\u20101 by the HCMV pp65 tegument protein interferes with production of IE\u20101\u2010derived peptides (Gilbert et al., 1996). The HIV\u20101 transcriptional activator (Tat) protein manipulates 26S proteasome function by directly interacting with the LMP7 and MECL1 subunits of the proteasome and competing with the 11S proteasome for binding to the 20S proteasome (Andre 1998, Apcher 2003), leading to inhibition of proteolytic activity. Tat also acts at the transcriptional level by modifying proteasome composition by upregulating the LMP7 and MECL1 subunits and downregulating the LMP2 subunit, leading to an increased presentation of cryptic and subdominant CTL epitopes (Gavioli et al., 2004). By preventing display of viral peptides, these viral proteins interfere with cytotoxic T cell recognition.",

SopE is a bacterial guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) delivered by a TTSS that mimics a host cell GEF for the small Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, involved in actin remodeling and formation of membrane extensions required for bacterial engulfment. SptP, delivered by another TTSS, is a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) factor for Cdc42 and Rac1, which accelerates GTP hydrolysis. SpT plays a role once bacterial internalization has taken place, inactivating the Rho GTPases, inhibiting actin polimerization, and assuring closure of the plasma membrane and recovery of the normal cellular architecture (Pizarro\u2010Cerda and Cossart, 2006). Salmonella initially delivers equal amounts of SopE and SptB to the host cell. However, 15\u201320 min after infection SopE is rapidly degraded, whereas SptB degradation occurs only slowly after 3 h, thereby efficiently timing the actin remodeling events that lead to the initial bacterial engulfment and the later host cell recovery. Both processes are proteasome\u2010dependent and catalyzed by the N\u2010terminus of the bacterial proteins, but the mechanism and the host factors involved are currently unknown (Kubori and Galan, 2003).",

The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide\u2010like 3G (APOBEC3G) and related cytidine deaminases are involved in mRNA editing and in immunoglobulin gene class switching and hypermutation but are also potent antiretroviral enzymes. The cytosolic APOBEC3G is incorporated into budding virions, where on infection of new target cells, its cytidine deaminase activity induces G to A hypermutation on the minus\u2010strand viral DNA, resulting in abortive infection (Bishop 2004b, Zhang 2003). Vif hijacks the elongin\u2010C\u2010elongin\u2010B\u2010Cullin\u20105\u2010E3 (ECS) complex. The ECS5 E3s recognize substrate receptor proteins containing a BC\u2010box. Vif possesses a BC\u2010box motif, through which it binds elongin C (Luo et al., 2005). Vif hijacks the E3 ligase complex and by bridging APOBEC3G and elongin C targets APOBEC3G for ubiquitination and degradation (Yu et al., 2003). This ultimately allows production of infectious virus progeny (Bieniasz 2004, Bishop 2004a, Harris 2004).",

HRS nucleates recruitment of the ESCRT\u20101 complex, which in turn recruits ESCRT 2 and \u20103, leading to formation of the inner membranes of the MVB. TSG101 is a noncanonical Ub E2 variant (UEV) protein\u2014it does not possess Ub\u2010conjugating activity, only an N\u2010terminal UEV domain that binds ubiquitin. Binding of the TSG101 UEV domain to a P(S/T)AP tetrapeptide motif on HRS recruits HRS to the endosomal membrane, triggering assembly of ESCRT complexes and genesis of the MVB (Clague 2003, Garrus 2001, Pornillos 2002, Pornillos 2003). Many viruses such as HIV\u20101 and Ebola recruit this Ub\u2010dependent sorting machinery to the viral release sites at the plasma membrane to promote virus budding from host cells (Li 2005, Liu 2004), by making use of conserved P(S/T)AP, PPXY, or FPIV motifs, also called late budding domains (Bieniasz, 2006).",

Other viruses can also recruit neuronal precursor cell\u2010expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4) and NEDD\u20104\u2010like HECT E3 ligases to facilitate viral budding (Bieniasz 2006, Harty 2001, Sakurai 2004, Yasuda 2003). NEDD4 E3s ligases are a diversified group of orthologues of yeast Rsp5p and are involved in a wide range of processes such as receptor internalization and degradation (presumably through the endolysosomal pathway), maintenance of EBV latency, and regulation of cytokine signaling. NEDD4 E3s have a catalytic C\u2010terminal HECT domain, two or more central N\u2010terminal WW domains, and an N\u2010terminal C2 domain. The N\u2010terminal C2 domain seems to be responsible for membrane association and cellular localization of the protein. The WW domain is a protein\u2013protein interaction module of about 35 amino acids with two crucial tryptophan (W) residues spaced 20\u201322 amino acids apart, which appears to mediate substrate selection. It binds mostly proline\u2010rich motifs, such as the PPXY motif present in many cellular proteins, targeting them for degradation (Ingham 2004, Ingham 2005). Viral proteins with the PPXY motif can therefore bind these WW domains on Nedd4 E3s, but the nature of these interactions and how they facilitate virus budding is so far unknown. Some viruses, like Ebola, have two different late budding motifs, PPXY and P(S/T)AP, and the Ebola late domain\u2010containing VP40 matrix protein can recruit both TSG101 and NEDD4 for effective budding (Licata 2003, Liu 2004, Yasuda 2003). The nonenveloped adenovirus possesses a PPXY motif on its penton base protein, which is essential for virus internalization that can interact with several NEDD4 HECT E3 ligases (Galinier et al., 2002). Whether or not this interaction or E3 ligase activity is required for adenovirus entry is currently unknown.",

Agrobacterium is a common phytopathogenic bacterium that induces \u201ccrown gall\u201d disease in plants by transfer and integration of a segment of its tumor\u2010inducing (Ti) plasmid DNA into the plant genome. This process relies also on delivery of several virulence (Vir) proteins into the host cell, such as the bacterial VirE2 protein, which is thought to package and protect the transported T\u2010DNA molecule, and, together with the host plant VIP1 protein, assist its nuclear import (Tzfira et al., 2004a). However, disassembly of this VirE2/T\u2010DNA/VIP1 complex must occur before integration and involves intranuclear proteolysis of VirE2 and VIP1 induced by the VirF protein, an F\u2010box\u2010domain\u2013containing protein. The bacterial VirF F\u2010box hijacks the SCF E3 plant homologue. The VirF\u2010containing SCFVirF then leads to degradation of VIP1 and VirE2, and integration of the Agrobacterium T\u2010DNA (Tzfira et al., 2004b).

            "text": "The host innate response triggered by type I interferon (IFN\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2) innate response is crucial in early immunity against viruses, bacteria, and some parasites, acting to limit pathogen infection limiting replication of the pathogen and constraining cellular permissiveness to infection (Smith et al., 2005). Type I interferon receptor signaling occurs through the JAK/STAT pathway and leads to transcription of several IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs), of which the gene encoding the Ub\u2010like modifier ISG15 is one of the most strongly induced (Farrell et al., 1979). ISG15 and protein modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) are induced by viral and bacterial infection or other stresses, suggesting important roles for the ISG15 system in innate immune responses (Liu 2005, Ritchie 2004). ISG15 is conjugated onto several signaling molecules with immunomodulatory functions, like JAK/STAT proteins (Giannakopoulos 2005, Malakhov 2003). The ISGylation cascade is initiated by ISG15 activation by an E1\u2010like enzyme, UBE1L, transfer to the ISG\u2010conjugating UBCH8 enzyme (Zhao et al., 2004), and incorporation into UBCH8\u2010compatible Ub E3 ligases (Dastur 2006, Zou 2006). A deISGylating enzyme, ubiquitin\u2010binding protein 43 (UBP43), also called USP18, specifically removes ISG15 from ISGylated substrates (Malakhov et al., 2002), and is regulated by ubiquitination by the SCFSkp2 E3 (Tokarz et al., 2004). USP18 is unlikely to be the sole enzyme capable of acting on ISG15 conjugates.",

            "text": "The role of ISG15 in orchestration of the innate antiviral response sets the ground for pathogen interference. Although the mechanism is unclear, viral replication in UBP43 knockout mice is impaired, a phenotype that was initially attributed to inhibition of deISGylation and deregulation of STAT signaling (Ritchie et al., 2002). There are conflicting views on this (Dao 2005, Kim 2006b, Knobeloch 2005) and UBP43 may in fact inhibit type I IFN signaling irrespectively of its ISG15 isopeptidase activity, by binding to the IFN receptor and blocking the interaction between JAK and the IFN receptor (Malakhova et al., 2006). IFN\u2010mediated inhibition of HIV replication and budding is dependent on ISG15 (Kunzi 1996, Pitha 1994, Poli 1989). Expression of ISG15 inhibits ubiquitination of the HIV\u20101 Gag protein and TSG101, and disrupts the interaction of the Gag late budding domain with TSG101 (Okumura et al., 2006). Either of these ISG15 effects and/or additional mechanisms of action could lead to failure to recruit ESCRT complexes and inhibition of HIV budding. ISG15 is strongly induced by infection with influenza B virus. The exact cellular function and targets of ISG15 are not known, but the NS1 protein of influenza B viruses (NS1B) blocks its conjugation to target proteins: the NS1B N\u2010terminus binds ISG15, inhibiting activation of ISG15 by its E1 enzyme, UBE1L. Influenza A viruses also manipulate cellular ISGylation processes, through an even less well characterized mechanism: the influenza A virus NS1A protein does not directly bind the ISG15 protein, but little or no ISG15 protein is produced during infection (Yuan 2001, Yuan 2002). Whether this reflects ISGylation, deISGylation, and/or UBP43 ubiquitination\u2010mediated control of the IFN innate immune response is so far unknown.",

The human enteric flora may influence intestinal epithelium inflammatory tolerance by inhibiting the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway, which can be achieved by blocking any one of the many Ub\u2010dependent steps that control it. Shigella flexneri, which causes severe diarrhea in humans, injects TTSS\u2010effector proteins into host cells to induce their entry into epithelial cells or trigger apoptosis in macrophages. The OspG effector is a serine/threonine kinase that binds various E2s, including UbcH5, a component of the SCF\u03b2\u2010TrCP E3 complex. OspG binding to UbcH5 inhibits the SCF\u03b2\u2010TrCP complex and thereby phospho\u2010IkB degradation, blocking NF\u2010\u03baB signaling in response to the bacterial infection. The Cullin subunit of the SCF\u03b2\u2010TrCP complex is itself regulated by NEDD8 attachment (Pan et al., 2004). Certain enteric bacteria can lead to rapid deneddylation of Cullin\u20101 and consequent repression of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway (Collier\u2010Hyams et al., 2005), but the bacterial activities responsible are still to be determined. In any case, because NF\u2010\u03baB is crucial for both the initial innate inflammatory response and for coordination of the adaptive immune response, dampening of inflammation may endow Shigella and other enteric bacteria with the ability to invade and later colonize the gastrointestinal epithelium (Kim et al., 2005).",

Poleroviruses are small positive\u2010strand RNA viruses that cause leafroll phenotypes in many plant species.

The P0 F\u2010box is required for polerovirus infectivity and its silencing suppressor function (Pazhouhandeh et al., 2006). P0 presumably binds the microRNAs and targets them for Cullin\u20104A\u2010dependent degradation.

We discussed mK3 which catalyzes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of nascent murine class I MHC HCs after dislocation from the ER membrane (Lybarger 2005, Wang 2005). KSHV kK3 and kK5 and myxoma virus M153R catalyze ubiquitination of cell surface class I MHC HC, thus providing the trigger for their internalization from the cell membrane, as well as for sorting through MVB formation to lysosomal degradation (Duncan et al., 2006). In addition to downregulation of class I MHC molecules, some of these K3 homologues target the lymphocyte costimulatory molecules CD86 (B7.2) and intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM\u20101, CD1d, and CD4 (Coscoy 2003, Coscoy 2001, Lehner 2005, Mansouri 2003), as well as the Fas/CD95 death receptor (Collin 2005, Guerin 2002). By targeting not only class I MHC molecules, the viral K3 homologues are adding an extra layer of protection predicted to be important for viral escape after reactivation from latency (Lehner et al., 2005). The K3 homologues are most likely making use of old ideas: the mechanisms used by the viral Ub ligases have probably been \u201cborrowed\u201d from their mammalian counterparts, the MARCH proteins, and will certainly continue to yield insights into the Ub\u2010proteasome system.",

            "text": "A bacterial E3 ligase was recently shown to inactivate another type of immune response in plants (Janjusevic et al., 2006). Antipathogen responses in plants, although not as sophisticated as those afforded by the vertebrate immune system, are nevertheless quite efficient. One mechanism, immunity\u2010induced programmed cell death (PCD), is a response that sacrifices a limited portion of the plant to limit spread of the infection. The Pseudomonas syringae bacterium, which causes disease in tomato and Arabidopsis, delivers its AvrPtoB protein into plant cells through a type III secretion system. AvrPtoB can inhibit PCD in susceptible hosts, allowing Pseudomonas to cause systemic infection and disease. The AvrPtoB C\u2010terminus encodes a U\u2010box E3 ligase activity necessary for the pathogenic role of AvrPtoB, since mutation of the putative E2\u2010recruitment sites abolishes the anti\u2010PCD and virulence activities of the AvrPtoB protein (Janjusevic et al., 2006). Determining the host targets of the Pseudomonas E3 will be crucial in clarifying its mechanism of action and might even explain plant susceptibility to infection. Such experiments may also assist in the identification of similar targets in mammalian species infected with comparable Gram\u2010negative microbes. Furthermore, it is rather striking that another pathogen uses a mimic of a host E3 ligase to encode an immunomodulatory function. There are bound to be others.",

The IL\u20102\u2010inducible DUB\u20102 is constitutively expressed in cells transformed by human T cell leukemia virus\u20101 (HTLV\u20101). Like other cytokines, IL\u20102 is an important modulator of apoptosis in T cells that acts through the STAT pathway. Although the mechanism is not at all clear, DUB\u20102 activity prolongs IL\u20102\u2010stimulated phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT5, inhibiting T cell apoptosis in the aftermath of the immune response (Migone 2001, Shackelford 2004) and possibly contributing to cell immortalization. Cytokine\u2010inducible DUBs could interfere with cytokine signaling, thereby playing an active role in modulation of the immune response. The IL\u20101\u2010inducible DUB\u20101 is specifically induced by interleukin 3 (IL\u20103), GM\u2010CSF, and IL\u20105, which suggests a role in responses mediated by these cytokines (D'Andrea and Pellman, 1998) and might constitute a target for pathogen modulation of the immune response through interference with the Ub\u2010proteasome system. Although a review of this rapidly expanding field is beyond the scope of this chapter, even this simple example suffices to demonstrate how both Ub addition and removal control immune physiology, and consequently are likely targets for interference by pathogens.",

Enteropathogenic Yersinia species are extracellular multiplying Gram\u2010negative bacteria that make use of type III secretion systems to inject virulence factors into host cells. The Yersinia YopJ virulence factor encodes a protein reported to be a cysteine protease that can cleave Ub and SUMO. The YopJ DUB inhibits NF\u2010\u03baB and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, a function ascribed previously to its somewhat promiscuous deubiquitination of critical cellular proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkB. The MAPK/JUN pathway is involved in transcriptional control of several cytokine genes. The YopJ activity induces macrophage death and blocks their ability to activate these inflammatory pathways (Orth 2002, Orth 2000, Zhou 2005). However, recent reports show that the true function of YopJ is that of a serine/threonine acetyltransferase (Mukherjee et al., 2006). The way by which the functions assigned to YopJ have changed as the field advances demonstrates the complexity of assigning a function to proteins that lack obvious mammalian counterparts. Both Salmonella and the plant pathogen Xanthomonas secrete proteins with homology to YopJ, but their putative DUB activity or function in the host have not been assessed yet (Gurlebeck 2006, Hardt 1997).",

The UL36USP is located at the N\u2010terminus of the UL36, the large tegument protein of HSV\u20101, an \u03b1\u2010herpesvirus. Despite the overall low sequence homology\u2014at the exception of almost only the amino acid residues composing the catalytic triad\u2014the UL36USP activity is well conserved in all members of the Herpesviridae family, as the homologous proteins in murine cytomegalovirus (a \u03b2\u2010herpesvirus) and EBV (a \u03b3\u2010herpesvirus) also exhibit DUB activity in vitro (Schlieker et al., 2005). One of the two severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus proteases responsible for cleavage of the replicase polyprotein, the SARS\u2010CoV papain\u2010like protease PLpro, is also a DUB (Barretto 2005, Lindner 2005), predicted to be structurally similar to human USP7 (Hu et al., 2002). The SARS\u2010CoV Plpro protease activity is involved in the processing of the viral polyprotein, thereby contributing to replication of the viral RNA genome. The function of the SARS virus deubiquitinating activity, which extends to ISG15\u2010removal activity (Lindner et al., 2005), is unknown at this point. The adenovirus proteinase (Avp) and the human cytomegalovirus UL48 protein also encode DUB activities, but the viral and/or cellular targets remain unidentified (Balakirev 2002, Wang 2006b). Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes a variety of diseases in humans has two genes, ChlaDub1 and ChlaDub2, whose products encode deubiquitinating and deNEDDylating activities (Misaghi et al., 2006). Unlike C. pneumoniae whose genome is devoid of ChlaDub genes, C. trachomatis is able to block NF\u2010\u03baB signaling and thus the inflammatory response, as well as host cell apoptosis. Both processes could be modulated by the C. trachomatis DUBs.",

Although the experimental evidence is at best tenuous, one can speculate that many of these other pathogen\u2010encoded DUBs may be important for modulation of the Ub\u2010proteasome system during the pathogen life cycle and/or in the context of immune evasion. The fact that these DUB activities are conserved suggests functional importance. They may be delivered to the host cell at the time of infection (for instance, by a bacterial type III secretion system or by a viral tegument protein) or may be transcribed early during infection. The pathogen\u2010encoded DUB could interfere with the levels of Ub\u2010 or Ubl\u2010conjugated proteins, thereby altering cellular processes ranging from signaling pathways, protein degradation, antigen presentation, vesicular trafficking, and many others.",

Similarly\u2014and although the sample pool is rather small at the moment\u2014there is no reason to believe that encoding their own DUBs and/or hijacking of host DUBs has not \u201coccurred\u201d to pathogens. An attractive possibility is that some of these activities are aimed at manipulating the host immune system. Possible targets would include pathways involved in \u201chousekeeping\u201d processes like life and death of the cells of the immune system, and extend to, for example, interference with antigen presentation. These DUB activities could manipulate membrane trafficking in ways that would prevent MHC molecules from reaching the cell surface, or prevent proteasomal degradation of pathogen\u2010derived proteins. This initial window of deubiquitinating activity could help viruses escape detection. Bacterial pathogens could benefit from targeting of transcription factors and cytokine signaling networks that are crucial for coordination of macrophage effector functions. Other immune responses that could, in principle, be controlled by DUBs are IFN and NF\u2010NF\u2010\u03baB signaling, and the posttranscriptional gene silencing \u201cimmune response\u201d at least in plants. The possibilities are endless. Exploitation of the Ub\u2010proteasome system by pathogens to enhance their own survival is beginning to emerge as a central theme. The development of the appropriate genetic and biochemical tools will help place this subject in the realm of essential host\u2013pathogen interactions.",
