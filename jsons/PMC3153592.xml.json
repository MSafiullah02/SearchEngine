However, our group and others have realized that a substantial number of patients with respiratory tract disease have more than one viral pathogen.19, 20, 21 The frequency of respiratory virus co-infections varies widely in the literature but is often reported between 10 and 20%22, 23, 24, 25 and in one report as high as 60%.26 This is understandable as many respiratory viruses circulate at similar times often with a winter time predominance in temperate climates. Recently, Brunstein et al. provided statistical evidence that co-infection with certain pathogens occurs more frequently than expected if co-infection was random.25 Influenza has often been identified with co-infecting viruses.20 Several groups speculate that early spread of influenza may be altered by co-circulation of traditional seasonal viruses.27, 28, 29, 30\n",

Yet a growing number of reports now challenge this notion.16, 17, 18 Rhinovirus co-infections have been associated with worse disease when co-infecting with RSV.13 Our findings demonstrate this is not true regarding influenza. Rhinovirus co-infection had little impact on influenza disease, in fact they had milder findings in several key areas. The opposite was true in patients with coronavirus/influenza co-infection. Comparable to other studies,38, 42 we observe the total number of influenza and coronavirus co-infections is low (1.12%). But we find that the resulting disease was substantially more severe. This highlights the importance of recognizing respiratory virus pairings as distinct clinical entities.",

Explanation as to why disease severity was altered without changes in viral titer may lie in the resulting immunologic response.

The co-infection rate may be even higher were we to expand the number of pathogens to include enterovirus, HPIV4, and other influenza virus types (B and C). Time to presentation also varied within the groups which may affect the sensitivity of viral detection. Advancing molecular modalities including MassTag PCR, ViroChip and Deep sequencing will ultimately provide a more complete picture of co-infection frequency. It has been well described that severe clinical illness in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was associated with underlying co-morbidities including obesity, diabetes, or pregnancy. Collection and screening of samples as well as the use of the clinical severity score were independent of any patient\u2019s underlying co-morbidities. In addition to patient co-morbidities, the severity of illness may also be associated to other factors, such as delayed medical attention and lack of antiviral therapy.

Therefore, it is not clear that what happened with the 2009 pandemic influenza virus can be extrapolated to seasonal influenza viruses. Also, relative humidity affects both influenza virus transmission and influenza virus survival.51 Comparisons of findings when influenza is spread mainly by contact (similar to rhinovirus at times of higher absolute humidity) and when it is spread as small particle aerosol (during the peak and lower humidity) may differ. This may explain some differences in our findings compared to similar studies.38 Furthermore, while we point out that disease severity likely depends on the type of the co-infecting pathogen, the numbers of certain co-detected pathogens in the H1N1 infected patients are too small for more detailed analysis. Continued investigation over multiple seasons will be required to answer these questions. Despite these limitations, we demonstrate that clinical relevance of influenza viral co-infection varies greatly and may be associated with the co-infecting pathogen involved.",
