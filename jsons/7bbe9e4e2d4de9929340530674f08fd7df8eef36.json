This leads to reduced secretion and/or infectivity of virions and hence lower viral titres, both in vitro and in vivo. Free oligosaccharide analysis from iminosugar-treated cells shows that antiviral activity correlates with production of monoand tri-glucosylated sugars, indicative of inhibition of ER \u03b1-glucosidases. We demonstrate that glucose-mimicking iminosugars inhibit isolated glycoprotein and glycolipid processing enzymes and that this inhibition also occurs in primary cells treated with these drugs. Galactose-mimicking iminosugars that have been tested do not inhibit glycoprotein processing but do inhibit glycolipid processing, and are not antiviral against DENV. By comparison, the antiviral activity of glucosemimetic iminosugars that inhibit endoplasmic reticulum-resident \u03b1-glucosidases, but not glycolipid processing, demonstrates that inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidases is responsible for iminosugar antiviral activity against DENV. This monograph will review the investigations of many researchers into the mechanisms of action of iminosugars and the contribution of our current understanding of these mechanisms for optimising clinical delivery of iminosugars. The effects of iminosugars on enzymes other than glucosidases, the induction of ER stress and viral receptors will be also put into context.

N-linked glycans are added to proteins at specific amino acid sequences, initially by addition of Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 , where Glc is glucose, Man is mannose and GlcNAc is N-acetyl glucosamine ( Fig. 20.1 ). Once this precursor oligosaccharide is transferred to a glycoprotein, the carbohydrate chain is subjected to a variety of processing reactions, including both removal Following translocation of a newly transcribed peptide into the ER, a preassembled precursor oligosaccharide, consisting of 3 glucose (Glc), 9 mannose (Man) and 2 N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues (Glc 3 Man 9 GLcNAc 2 ) is transferred to the nascent polypeptide. Stepwise removal of first the outer \u03b11,2-linked glucose residue by \u03b1-glucosidase I (GluI), then the next two \u03b11,3-linked glucose residues by \u03b1-glucosidase II (GluII) occurs. The lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin can bind to the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide intermediate (Glc 1 Man 9 GLcNAc 2 ) to slow glycoprotein progression through the ER and allow for correct folding. UDP-glucose glycoprotein:glycoslytransferase (UGGT) detects misfolded proteins and reglucosylates the oligosaccharides to allow for repeated interaction with calnexin and other folding chaperones and enzymes (calnexin cycle). Correctly folded proteins can bud from the ER for transport to the Golgi and further processing, or alternatively undergo additional processing by ER degradationenhancing \u03b1-mannosidase I-like protein (EDEM) and other ER mannosidases to be targeted for degradation. Free oligosaccharides (FOS) are generated during protein N-glycosylation in mammalian cells and specific species can be detected by HPLC in cell lysates. For example, inhibition of GluII results in a monoglucosylated glycoprotein. After trimming of the glycan precursor by mannosidases and recognition of the glycoprotein as terminally misfolded, a Glc 1 Man 4 GlcNAc 1 FOS species is cleaved from the peptide during ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In the case of inhibition of GluI, (not shown) the Glc 3 Man 5 GlcNAc 1 FOS species can be detected (Adapted from [67]) and addition of sugar residues in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi to produce the typical high-mannose, hybrid, and complex types of oligosaccharides. Glycans play a specific role in glycoprotein folding through the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. \u03b1-glucosidase I (GluI) and \u03b1-glucosidase II (GluII) sequentially trim the terminal glucoses from the precursor oligosaccharide, resulting in the monoglucosylated Glc 1 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 which is bound by calnexin [81] . Through interactions with various protein disulphide isomerases and other chaperones, the glycoprotein has the chance to fold correctly while being held in the ER, before progressing to the Golgi. The glycoprotein eventually plays a role in the viral life cycle or is incorporated into a new virion. These host cell glycosylation processes are required by viruses expressing glycoproteins as no virus has been identified to encode the enzymes required for biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides. DENV possesses four N-linked glycoproteins: envelope, premembrane, non-structural protein 1 (NS1), and non-structural protein 4B.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2269, "end": 2274, "text": "[67])", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2738, "end": 2742, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 378, "end": 387, "text": "Fig. 20.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "N-Linked Glycoprotein Production and Processing"}, {"text": "Iminosugars are so named due to their resemblance to monosaccharides, differing where the ring oxygen has been replaced with a nitrogen atom.

Interestingly, both HSP90 [61] and BiP [34] have been proposed to act as attachment or entry receptors for DENV in certain cells. Despite this chaperone redundancy, ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors were first shown to have antiviral effects on DENV by Courageot et al. [17] via a mechanism that did not affect viral protein synthesis, but appeared to reduce prME heterodimer formation and stability. They concluded that the formation of properly folded DENV envelope complexes requires a lectin chaperone pathway. Since then many studies have shown that iminosugars are antiviral against DENV [67] .

These results, combined with encouraging pre-clinical pharmacology results and human safety data obtained from clinical trials of celgosivir against HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [20, 35] , where it had modest antiviral effects, supported a Phase 1b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 50 adult dengue patients (CELADEN, NCT01619969).

Iminosugars have demonstrated antiviral activity against all four serotypes of DENV [92] ( When supernatant from iminosugar-treated DENV-infected primary human macrophages is assayed for both infectious virus (by plaque assay) and total virus production (by qRT-PCR for DENV RNA), the levels of virus decrease concomitantly. This is consistent with ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition resulting in sufficient misfolding of viral glycoproteins such that they are targeted for degradation and there is reduced secretion of virus. However, reduced secretion is not the outcome of iminosugar treatment of all viruses. In the case of HIV, iminosugars affect infectivity to a greater degree than secretion: iminosugar treatment alters the glycosylation of gp120 resulting in only modest reductions in virus released from infected cells, but strongly impaired viral entry at a stage post CD4-binding [22, 23] . It is not possible to predict whether iminosugar treatment will result in reduced virion infectivity alone, or also in reduced secretion, and as such this has to be determined on a virus-by-virus basis [38] . The differential effects of iminosugars on Iminosugars with six-membered rings have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against viruses infecting humans. secretion and infectivity seen with different viruses may also be compound or cell type specific, as in baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells N-nonyl-DNJ (NN-DNJ) reduced DENV RNA replication in addition to effects on the DENV glycoproteins [94] .

Ideally, to confirm that blocking viral glycoprotein entry to the ER calnexin quality control cycle results in the formation of misfolded viral glycoproteins with subsequent antiviral effect, a demonstration that iminosugar treatment of DENV-infected cells results in misfolded DENV glycoprotein(s) would be important. The three studies that monitored the effects of iminosugars on DENV glycoprotein folding and secretion [17, 58, 94] are documented in Table 20 .1. Castanospermine treatment of DENV-infected cells reduced levels of immunoprecipitated E to 15-30% compared to that from untreated cells, when a conformationsensitive monoclonal antibody was used, and the amount of E co-precipitated with prM was about 25% of that from untreated cells, demonstrating that the iminosugar decreased formation of the prME heterodimer, and that inhibition of glucosidases affects the correct folding of DENV E in this system [17] . Such a study monitoring the effects of iminosugars on folding of DENV glycoproteins could be expanded utilizing larger panels of monoclonal antibodies which recognise both conformation-dependent and -independent epitopes to all four DENV glycoproteins. This has been performed for the heavily studied HIV gp120, for which many more validated reagents are available. Studies on the effects of NB-DNJ on gp120 folding demonstrated that interaction with the calnexin/calreticulin pathway was critical for correct folding of the V2 loop of HIV gp120, as blocked entry into this folding pathway resulted in conformation defects in this region [23] . A recent study took this observation a step further, assessing regional folding using monoclonal antibodies against conformational epitopes in combination with mathematical modelling, which showed that misfolding of only a portion of the gp120 was sufficient to produce an amplified effect on infectivity (S.G.

By preventing the production of the monoglucosylated glycan it blocks glycoprotein binding to calnexin/calreticulin as has been described above and in Wu et al. [94] . Secondly, the retained terminal glucoses block access of \u03b1-mannosidase enzymes to the D1 arm of the glycan, theoretically preventing the formation of complex glycans. The hypothesis that glucosidase inhibitors may be antiviral due to the absence of complex sugars was the basis of the original studies on iminosugars and viruses in the 1980s. In cells with an active Golgi endomannosidase, this can be partially salvaged; however, the activity of endomannosidase is highly cell line dependent [21, 50, 75] . For example, BHK-21 cells and the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 express high levels of endomannosidase [37] [68, 89] while Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have no detectable endomannosidase activity [63] . Production of DENV prM and NS1 with hyperglycosylated glycans has been demonstrated by mobility shift of the viral glycoprotein in electrophoresis [58, 92] .

Through a comparison of antiviral activity with inhibition of glycolipid processing using glucose and galactose analogues of iminosugars, we have recently shown that antiviral activity of iminosugars against DENV is a function of inhibition of glycoprotein processing rather than due to any effects on GCS [68, 89] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[68,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Off-Target Effects"}, {"text": "Blocking productive folding of viral glycoproteins can alter retention times in the ER lumen followed by accumulation and/or increased ERAD.

As with the effects of iminosugars on secretion of different viruses, their effects on host glycoproteins are predicted to be protein specific. Treatment with IHVR-17028, a DNJ-derivative, altered the N-linked glycan structure of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a manner that did not affect its expression or binding to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein but disrupted its ability to participate in virus envelope-triggered membrane fusion [98] .

One of the specific difficulties of using iminosugars to treat dengue disease, which is more broadly applicable to its use against any acute viral infection, is the short window available for treatment. By the time a dengue patient presents to the healthcare system, they typically may have had a fever for 2-4 days, at which stage there is only 24-48 h before viral load drops as the immune system controls viral replication. The task for an antiviral to reduce viral load in such a window will require a safe, fast acting, highly potent drug. In considering whether an iminosugar could be administered to people living in an endemic setting who present with fever, independent of the differential diagnosis, a dengue therapeutic would need to have an excellent safety profile. Phase I single-ascending dose trial results recently released for MON-DNJ are promising in this respect (NCT02061358), however recruitment for the clinical trial testing the safety and pharmacokinetics of MON-DNJ administered as multiple ascending doses (NCT02696291) was terminated for business reasons in March 2018. All these challenges will be relevant for the use of iminosugars therapeutically against a number of acute viruses, while treating chronic viral disease will present different challenges. The rapid clearance of iminosugars in vivo makes reaching sufficient concentrations to mediate antiviral effects a specific challenge for these compounds. Following oral administration celgosivir had a plasma half-life of 2.5 h in patients [76] , which is similar to 5.14 h in mice given a single dose of MON-DNJ orally at 200 mg/kg [51] . In addition, iminosugars are generally excreted rapidly in the urine [2] . The clinical trial testing NB-DNJ against HIV concluded that sufficient plasma concentrations could not be achieved to obtain a convincing antiviral effect [24, 80] . In efforts to maximise the mean trough concentrations, and increase the chance of success in testing celgosivir efficacy against DENV, coordinators of the next celgosivir trial performed pharmacokinetic modelling and propose increasing the number of doses per day [76] . An alternate approach, previously shown to enhance antiviral activity of iminosugars against HIV >100,000-fold in vitro [53, 54] , is encapsulation of the compounds in liposomes, a system used clinically to mediate intracellular delivery of anti-cancer and anti-fungal treatments. When tested in vivo against DENV in an ADE mouse model, liposome-mediated delivery of NB-DNJ, in comparison with free NB-DNJ, resulted in a 3-log 10 reduction in the dose of drug required to enhance animal survival [45] . Although a promising approach, the specific formulation of liposomes tested in this study was costly and not sufficiently stable for liposome-mediated delivery to be investigated further. The availability of iminosugars with generally low toxicity makes the optimisation of pharmacokinetics and dosing regimens currently a more promising approach to optimising clinical iminosugar delivery.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1628, "end": 1632, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1721, "end": 1725, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1797, "end": 1800, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1963, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1967, "text": "80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 2234, "end": 2238, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2365, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2369, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2737, "end": 2741, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Iminosugars As Pharmaceuticals"}, {"text": "Because ER glucosidases control glycan processing of both viral and host cellular glycoproteins, it would not necessarily be predicted that inhibition of ER glucosidases selectively suppresses viral replication, and yet, in animals at least, a therapeutic window clearly exists where iminosugars are antiviral and well tolerated, at least for acute treatment. A number of possible explanations exist for this dichotomy but further experiments will need to be performed to determine their relative contributions. When viruses infect cells, their proteins are the predominant proteins being synthesised and hence may be more susceptible to inhibition of ER glucosidases. In addition, the DENV virion is comprised of a closely packed, repetitive and coordinated interaction of E and prM proteins which may increase virion susceptibility to any perturbation. Interestingly, in the case of HIV, very little protein misfolding is required to affect virion infectivity (S.G. Spiro, 2016, unpublished results). When the proportions of misfolded gp120 in the presence of NB-DNJ were modelled, HIV infectivity was shown to be highly sensitive to the misfolding of only a small proportion of total gp120, suggesting an amplification effect that may contribute to the selectivity of iminosugars against viruses over the host.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Selectivity"}, {"text": "Against the background of historical findings, we highlight advances made in the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of antiviral activity of iminosugars against DENV. The generally accepted antiviral mechanism of ER glucosidase inhibitors, that inhibition of GluI and/or GluII prevents the removal of the terminal glucose moieties on N-linked glycans and results in misfolding and retention of glycoproteins in the ER and ultimate degradation via ERAD is supported by a number of pieces of evidence. These include the observations that iminosugars induce the electrophoretic mobility shift of viral glycoproteins, as well as structural changes of N-linked glycans and measurement of FOS consistent with GluI and GluII inhibition correlating with antiviral effect. Substrate flux along the N-linked glycosylation pathway makes the correlation between key enzymes and an antiviral effect complex [3] . Though both GluI and GluII are targets of iminosugars, the slower removal of the third glucose residue by GluII, even though iminosugars bind approximately tenfold more avidly to GluI [2] , is more sensitive to inhibition by iminosugars. As a result of inhibiting these enzymes, viral envelope glycoproteins cannot interact with ER chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin, preventing correct glycoprotein folding, oligomerization and assembly of infectious virions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 903, "end": 906, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1096, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Uniting the conclusions from these multiple studies also allows us to highlight areas where the mechanism of action of iminosugars against DENV could be understood in greater molecular detail.

The degree or location of misfolding may be protein dependent, potentially even down to strain-dependent differences. Use of iminosugars with galactose stereochemistry (DGJ compounds) has allowed the conclusion that the antiviral effect of piperidine iminosugars (monocylic iminosugars with an iminopyranose structure) against DENV observed in macrophages is not mediated by effects on enzymes of the glycolipid pathway. Development of selective ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors would allow both confirmation that ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition (and not other enzymes) is responsible for the antiviral effect of iminosugars and avoidance of gastrointestinal side effects due to inhibition of intestinal glucosidases.
