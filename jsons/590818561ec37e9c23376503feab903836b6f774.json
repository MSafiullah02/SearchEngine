The Muslims offers 5 time prayer in 24 hours and majority of people offers their prayer in the Masque and a huge gathering on Friday (Juma Prayer) which are still not controlled by the government. The offices, work places, markets are closed but the public is not staying at home they are having huge gathering in play grounds, picnic points, sitting and wondering in bazaar and the huge gatherings for getting free food (Rashen) at many places in every city. The complete lock down and imposing curfew by restricting people to their houses can decrease the contact rate, transmissibility and ultimately can decreases the no of positive cases and death rate and increase recoveries. When the exposure of the susceptible population is decrease to the infectious population so there will be decrease number positive cases vice versa as the exposure of susceptible and infectious population increase the number of positive patients will increase. So a complete lock down and imposing curfew, banning all religious and other gathering and restricting people to their homes can decrease the no of positive cases to limited no in two months. (",

Other measures of wearing mask using hand sanitizers increasing the hygiene can decrease the exposure to the virus.So we take the contact rate of the population of susceptible compartment with infectious compartment as \u03b2 for COVID-19.\u03b2 : Determines how much the disease can spread due to exposure.The \u03b2 value can be different for same virus but in different societies.All rights reserved.
