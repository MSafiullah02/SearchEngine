            "text": "IFN-mediated innate immune response forms a forward line of cell-autonomous defense against pathogens. Virus invasion (e.g., the presence of single-stranded RNA in endosomes or cytosolic double-stranded RNA) triggers the host cells to recognize the infection through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), that in turn mediate the production of IFNs [1]. The thus-released IFN molecules bind to cell-surface receptors and initiate signal transduction prominently involving the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK\u2013STAT) pathway. This activates the transcription of hundreds of so-called ISGs that are the effectors of cell-autonomous antiviral defense. Representative and well-studied ISG members with specific or broad antiviral activities include RIG-I, MDA5, MX2, IRF1, IRF3, IRF7, IRF9, IFITM3, ISG15, and OASL [2]. ISGs act at different stages of the viral life cycle, from entry, replication, assembly to release. This leads to a remarkable antiviral state that provides adequate cellular immunity against positive-, negative-, and double-stranded RNA viruses, DNA viruses, and even intracellular bacteria and parasites.",

Understanding the different mechanisms of ISG transcription and how their modes of action relate to clinically used antiviral medications will provide new insights into virus\u2013host interactions and novel avenues for antiviral drug development. Therefore, we aim to comprehensively review the classical and non-classical mechanisms regulating ISG transcription with emphasis on their clinical implications.",

Until now >20 distinct IFN genes/proteins have been identified. Based on the type of receptor through which they signal, the multitude of different IFNs in mammalian genome are classified into three major types: I, II, and III. In humans, type I IFNs include IFN-\u03b1 (which can be further subdivided into 13 different subtypes), IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b4, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03c4, and IFN-\u03c91\u20133. All type I IFNs bind to a common cell-surface receptor, the type I IFN heterodimeric receptor complexes comprising two subunits: IFN-\u03b1 receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFN-\u03b1 receptor 2 (IFNAR2). Unlike type I IFNs, there is only one type II IFN, IFN-\u03b3. It has no marked structural homology with type I IFNs. IFN-\u03b3 binds to a different cell-surface receptor composed of two subunits: IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. The type III IFN family comprises four members: IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A), IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B), and IFN-\u03bb4 (frameshift variant of IL-28B). They signal through the IFN-\u03bb receptor (IFN\u03bbR) which is composed of two subunits: IFN\u03bbR1 (IL28R\u03b1) and IL10R\u03b2.",

They are preassociated with the corresponding IFN receptor. Upon IFN binding to the receptor, they become activated through close-proximity trans-phosphorylation (JAK1, Tyr1022,1023; JAK2, Tyr1007,1008; and TYK2, Tyr1054,1055). Subsequently, activated JAKs phosphorylate the cytoplasmic regions of the receptor, generating docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, in particular STAT1 and STAT2 [21]. Activation of JAK enzymatic activity also triggers negative feedback on antiviral immunity. Phosphatases, including T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) 1B and CD45, are the most important negative regulators 22, 23, 24, 25. The SOCS-1 protein also negatively regulates this process through phosphorylation-mediated proteasomal degradation of JAK [26]. The key function of JAKs in cell signaling has made them ideal targets for controlling a range of autoimmune diseases. Several JAK inhibitors have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and ankylosing spondylitis [27].",

In response to IFNs, STAT1 is phosphorylated on Tyr701, Ser708, and Ser727. These sites are all positively related to signaling transduction 28, 29. STAT2 acquires transcriptional activation upon tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr690). Conversely, serine phosphorylation (Ser287) of STAT2 negatively regulates the IFN response 21, 30. Although JAKs play key role in STAT1 phosphorylation and activation, other cellular factors are also required. Tyrosine kinase non-receptor 1 (TNK1) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) potentiate dual phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701 and Ser727\n31, 32, 33, whereas nuclear cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) phosphorylates Ser727 of STAT1 34, 35. Protein kinase C family members, PKC-\u03b4 or PKC-\u03b5, mediate phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727 (no effect on STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation) via the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013Akt pathway 36, 37, 38, 39. Interestingly, stress signals can also induce phosphorylation of STAT1 (Ser727) via the p38\u2013MAPK pathway [40]. Because p38\u2013MAP kinase inhibitors are well-tolerated and safe for humans, it is thus tempting to speculate that such inhibitors might be used to mitigate proinflammatory effects following IFN-\u03b3 therapy [41].",

IRF9 alone binds to DNA and recognizes the specific promoter elements denoted as IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), but has no transcriptional activity. Upon DNA binding, IRF9 provides specific protein\u2013DNA interaction sites for STAT1 and STAT2. Activated STAT1 and STAT2 bind to the ISRE region together with IRF9 to exert strong pro-transcriptional activity [48]. Theoretically, IRF9 (as part of the ISGF3 complex) is only involved in regulating ISG transcription downstream of type I and III IFN signaling. However, IFN-\u03b3-induced ISG activation and the antiviral state were severely impaired in the absence of IRF9, indicating that IRF9 may also be involved in type II IFN signaling 49, 50. More interestingly, IFN-\u03b3 pretreatment induces high levels of IRF9, which serves as an important subunit of the latent precursor to ISGF3. In this way, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 synergize to induce the formation of ISGF3 complex, leading to much stronger ISG transcription [51].",

            "text": "Histone octamers bind to DNA and organize chromatin into higher-order nucleosomes, prohibiting transcription factor binding and gene expression [52]. As a consequence, the induction of ISGs by IFNs requires chromatin remodeling. The condensed chromatin needs to be transformed into a more relaxed structure. In humans, the nucleosome remodeling complexes BAF and PBAF prime ISG promoters by utilizing ATP-derived energy to maintain chromatin in a constitutively open conformation, allowing fast and potent induction of ISGs after IFN exposure 53, 54, 55, 56. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are also essential in chromatin modulation. These reactions are typically catalyzed by enzymes with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. HAT activity transforms chromatin into a more relaxed structure, while HDAC activity organizes chromatin into higher-order nucleosomes. Therefore, the HAT family members, including p300/CBP and GCN5, are essential for transcriptional activation of ISGs 57, 58. HATs are positive regulators of transcription in general. However, HDAC activity is also essential for transcriptional induction of ISGs 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64. HDAC activity has been reported to be required for recruiting RNA polymerase II to the promoters of ISGs [65], although how HDACs regulate the transcriptional activation of ISG remains unclear. In addition, the FOXO3 and PI3K/AKT pathways coordinately modulate chromatin structure. FOXO3, together with nuclear corepressor 2 (NCOR2) and HDAC3, forms a ternary complex to facilitate a closed chromatin structure, thereby limiting ISG transcription under basal conditions. However, type I IFN can activate the PI3 K/AKT pathway, which in turn leads to FOXO3 degradation and ISG transcription [66].",

In turn, these events provoke phosphorylation and activation of the p38 MAP kinase, an important mediator of the inflammatory response [96]. p38 MAP kinase activation leads to downstream MapKapK-2 and MapKapK-3 activation, contributing to type I IFN-dependent transcriptional regulation of ISGs.

However, this process is independent of the classical JAK\u2013STAT cascade, suggesting a non-canonical mechanism that is independent of IFNs [104]. Ribavirin, an inhibitor of the IMPDH enzyme, was shown to reset a subset of ISG promoters to a \u2018ready to be activated\u2019 state, thus potentiating ISG activation [105]. However, crosstalk between nucleotide synthesis and the innate immune response remains to be further elucidated.",

RA activates transcriptional via heterodimers of retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), and these bind to regions in promoters known as retinoic acid response elements (RAREs). Numerous studies have reported antiviral activities of RA against a variety of pathogens 106, 107. Interestingly, intracellular RA increases ISG expression at basal levels and augments ISG induction in response to IFNs [108]. This is consistent with the clinical observation that RA enhances the response to IFN-based antiviral therapy 107, 109. Strikingly, a bioinformatics study showed that most ISG regulatory regions contain RARE sequences [108]. This indicates that RA can induce transcriptional activation of these ISGs containing RAREs, facilitating the binding of additional transcription factors to the promoters of these ISGs. Consequently, RA initiates and works synergistically with IFNs to induce ISG expression.",

Because of its robust and broad antiviral activity, IFN-\u03b1 has represented the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV infections for decades. Its application also extends to other virus infections as an off-label treatment, for example hepatitis E virus [110] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [111]. IFN-\u03bb has been shown to play a crucial role in cancer, autoimmune disease, and viral infections [112]. The antitumor and anti-infection activities of IFN-\u03b3 have been comprehensively evaluated and used in a variety of clinical indications. It has been approved by FDA to treat chronic granulomatous disease and osteopetrosis, and is experimentally used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Friedreich's ataxia [113]. However, IFN-\u03b3 has not been successful in treating viral infections 114, 115. IFN-\u03bb has shown specific antiviral activity in both chronic HBV and HCV patients; although its efficacy was not superior compared to IFN-\u03b1 therapy, IFN-\u03bb had more limited side effects 116, 117. This is because IFN\u03bbR1 has a more restricted tissue-specific pattern of expression. IFN-\u03bb has also been shown to determine the intestinal epithelial antiviral host defense against rotavirus infection. It acts synergistically with IL-22 for the induction of ISGs, and eventually controls rotavirus infection in animal models 118, 119. Thus, IFN-\u03bb might be an attractive option for the treatment of many viral infections. Although the clinical application of IFNs, in particular for HCV, will be limited because of the recent launch of direct-acting antiviral agents, it may extend to other devastating viral diseases such as Ebola, Zika, or dengue virus infections.",

            "text": "Mechanistically, for all three types of IFNs, ISGs are the ultimate antiviral effectors. Recent studies on the function of individual ISGs indicate that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. Some ISGs possess broad antiviral properties whereas others have specific antiviral effects [120]. Thus, characterization of individual ISGs with respect to their antiviral spectrum or specificity provides new avenues for improving current antiviral therapies. Interestingly, several ISGs have been reported to paradoxically enhance the replication of certain viruses, illustrating the complexity of the network of mutual interaction between ISGs and viruses [120]. In preclinical or clinical studies, the expression patterns of some specific ISGs have been identified as biomarkers to predict treatment responses, disease progression, or outcomes in both infectious (e.g., HCV and HIV infections) 121, 122, 123 and non-infectious human diseases (e.g., Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus) 124, 125. Some ISGs (e.g., TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I, and MDA5) belong to the class of PRRs. Given their key roles in innate immune responses, there is growing interest in targeting PRRs for the prevention and treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Specific activators are now undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation for safety and efficacy [126]. With regards to the adverse effects of IFNs in the clinic, ISG-based antiviral strategies could be the next promising frontier in drug discovery.",

The three different classes of IFNs signal through their corresponding receptor complexes, leading to phosphorylation of preassociated Janus kinases. For type I and III IFNs, the phosphorylated Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) in turn phosphorylate the receptors at specific intracellular tyrosine residues. This leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and STAT2) at specific tyrosine residues. STAT1 and 2 then recruit IRF9 to form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). For type II IFNs, the phosphorylated JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the receptors on tyrosines, leading to homodimerization of STAT1. Both ISGF3 and STAT1 homodimers translocate to the nucleus for further phosphorylation at specific serine residues of STAT1, thereby achieving full activation. Consequently, ISGs are transcriptionally activated by binding of ISGF3 and STAT1 homodimers to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and \u03b3-activated sequence (GAS) promoter elements, respectively. Conversely, specific phosphatases in the nucleus dephosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2 to avoid excessive and detrimental responses.",
