Similar to other coronavirus, SARS-CoV membrane fusion is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein located on the viral envelope. Trimers of the spike protein form the peplomers that protrude from the virion giving these viruses their distinctive crown-like appearance. SARS-CoV S glycoprotein seems to be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits in Vero-E6 infected cells [5], but cleavage is not an absolute requirement for the mechanism of fusion [6]. Additionally, infection mediated by the SARS-CoV protein can be inhibited by specific inhibitors of the endosomal protease cathepsin L [7] suggesting that protein cleavage might play an important role activating spike protein for membrane fusion.",

Interestingly, raft microdomains have been also shown to be involved in virus entry [9]. The S1 subunit forms a globular head and is responsible for recognition of the host cell receptors [10], which for the SARS-CoV has been identified as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L [11], [12]. The S2 subunit is responsible for the fusion between viral and cellular membranes [13]. S2 sequence is highly conserved in coronavirus and contains different functional regions critical for membrane fusion as occurs in other class I viral fusion proteins (see Figure 1): a stretch of about 20 residues situated downstream of the minimum putative cleavage site and considered the fusion peptide [14], [15], a second fusion peptide (helper?) for the fusion peptide located immediately upstream of the HR1 region[16], [17], two heptad repeat regions HR1 and HR2 [18] and a stretch of about 13\u201318 residues that precedes the TM domain at the C terminus, i.e., the pretransmembrane domain [16], [19], [20].",

In the case of the HIV gp41 envelope protein, as well as in other fusion proteins of other retroviruses, it has been shown that the presence of a conserved immunodominant domain in the region of the loop separating the two heptad repeats that reverse the polypeptide chain [21\u201324]. This region seems important in the stabilization of the trimeric helical hairpin either in aqueous solution or in the presence of membranes [25]. Moreover, it has been shown that mutations in the loop region of gp41 affect the formation and dilation of fusion pores that are permeable to relatively small soluble molecules suggesting a role of this region in late steps of the membrane fusion process [26]. Finally, different peptides corresponding to this region have shown membrane binding and membrane perturbing capabilities [27\u201329], and therefore the interaction of this domain with the target cell membrane may be of key importance in the viral fusion mechanism. In the case of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, it was found a highly hydrophobic and interfacial domain flanked by the HR1 and HR2 regions [16] (Figure 1), and different peptides pertaining to this domain have shown a significant leakage effect [16] and an important SARS-CoV plaque formation inhibition [30]. These results support a role of this region in the fusion process such as it has been shown for the loop domain of HIV-1 gp41. Apart from that, while much progress has been made in understanding the membrane fusion mechanism of different viruses, available data concerning coronaviruses, particularly in the case of SARS-CoV, are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the present work was to gain an insight into the implication of the SARS-CoV loop domain in the membrane interaction.",

            "text": "The ability of the SARSL peptide to interact with membranes was determined from fluorescence studies of the peptide intrinsic Trp in presence of model membranes containing different phospholipid compositions at different lipid/peptide ratios. The Trp fluorescence emission intensity of the SARSL peptide decreased upon increasing the lipid/peptide ratio, indicating a significant change in the environment of the Trp moieties of the peptide (Figure 2A). The change on the Trp fluorescence of the peptide allows obtaining its partition coefficient, Kp, for different phospholipids (summarized in Table I). Kp values in the range 106\u2013107 were obtained, indicating that the peptide was bound to the membrane surface with high affinity. Slightly higher Kp values were obtained for negatively charged phospholipid-containing bilayers, EPG, EPA and BPS, than liposomes containing the neutral phospholipid EPC. These results were further corroborated by the displacement in the maximum emission wavelength of Trp in the presence of phospholipids LUVs. In buffer, the peptide had an emission maximum at 345 nm, typical for Trp in a polar environment, whereas, in the presence of increasing concentrations of membranes, the emission maximum presented a shift of about 4\u20136 nm to shorter wavelengths in negatively charged liposomes, but only 1 nm for zwitterionic ones. Differences in the fluorescence anisotropy values of the SARSL peptide were also observed when in the presence of phospholipid model membranes. It was found that addition of LUVs to the peptide increased significantly the anisotropy values (Table I), indicating an eventual decrease in the mobility of the Trp residue. The increase in anisotropy was lower in the zwitterionic phospholipid EPC than in the presence of the negatively charged phospholipids BPS, EPG and EPA. The SARSL peptide has a positive net formal charge of +1, so that an electrostatic effect might be the reason to observe relatively high binding and anisotropy values for compositions containing negatively charged phospholipids. However, it is not only the electrostatic attraction that is playing a role, since, as shown below, the peptide affects more significantly membranes containing zwitterionic phospholipids rather than those containing negatively-charged ones. The peptide mobility will be addressed in more detail later in the article, in the framework of the time-resolved data.",

            "text": "To assess the accessibility of the Trp residue of the SARSL peptide to the aqueous environment before and after binding to membranes having different phospholipid compositions, the water-soluble quencher acrylamide, an efficient neutral quencher probe [34] was used. Stern-Volmer plots for the quenching of Trp by acrylamide, recorded in the absence and presence of lipid vesicles, are shown in Figure 2B and the resultant Stern-Volmer constants are presented in Table I. The data reveal a weaker decrease in the fluorescence intensity in the presence of liposomes, indicating that the Trp residue was less accessible to the quencher in the presence of LUVs. The KSV value for the zwitterionic phospholipid EPC was slightly higher than those found in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. As observed in Figure 2B, the plots are linear with a unitary intercept showing that the Stern-Volmer dynamic quenching formalism describes accurately the data (it will be shown later that the variations in the peptide fluorescence lifetime do not affect this result). The transverse location (penetration) of the SARSL peptide in the lipid bilayer was evaluated by monitoring the relative quenching of the fluorescence of the Trp residue by the lipophylic spin probes 5NS and 16NS when the peptide was incorporated in the fluid phase of vesicles having different phospholipid compositions (Figure 2C). It can be seen that, in general, and for each one of the different membrane compositions studied, the SARSL peptide was quenched more efficiently by 16NS, quencher for molecules near or at the interface, than by 5NS, quencher for molecules buried deeply in the membrane allowing to conclude that SARSL remained close to the lipid/water interface. It can be seen that in general, and for each one of the different membrane compositions studied, although the SARSL peptide was quenched slightly more efficiently by 16NS, the difference for the two probes is not very high. This allows the conclusion that Trp resides in between these probes.",

            "text": "All the parameters describing the peptide fluorescence intensity decay are given in Table II. As expected for Trp [34], the decays are described by the sum of three exponentials, with typical values for the components lifetimes. The mean fluorescence lifetime at 25\u00b0C is around 2 ns, also a typical behavior for Trp residues. However, the lifetime-weighted quantum yield had an unusual behavior. In the absence of static quenching, this parameter should be proportional to the steady-state fluorescence intensity (to the quantum yield), and it is expected to decrease monotonically with raising temperature. As shown in Table II, this is not the case, because the amplitude averaged lifetime increases from 25\u201350\u00b0C. This means that in addition to thermal deactivation of the excited state, there should be another factor contributing to the lower quantum yield at 25\u00b0C. For the peptide in solution, this suggests that the peptide conformation and/or aggregation state changes between 25 and 50\u00b0C. Either the peptide becomes denatured, or an aggregate is destroyed at the higher temperature, taking a Trp quencher side-chain away from the vicinity of the indole ring. Upon interacting with lipid bilayers of different compositions, the parameters describing the fluorescence intensity decays of the peptide tend to change, but not dramatically [27], [28], [35]. The general trend observed here is a slight increase of both the amplitude-weighted and the intensity-weighted average lifetimes, except for EPC, for which the interaction with the peptide is weaker and the changes on peptide/structure/dynamics are smaller. The slight increase observed for the amplitude-weighted lifetime in all the anionic membranes studied is at variance with the marked decrease observed for the steady-state fluorescence intensity. This effect should be due to a strong conformational change and/or extensive aggregation of the peptide in the membrane. The fact that the amplitudes and the lifetime components change only mildly, and also that the order of the relative amplitudes was kept, suggests that a strong conformational change is not taking place, and favors an interpretation of the data as an extensive aggregation upon interaction with the membrane.",

            "text": "In order to gain more insight into the dynamic behavior of SARSL, as well as information on its aggregation state in water, the fluorescence anisotropy decay of the peptide was obtained in different systems. From visual inspection of the experimental fluorescence anisotropy decays (not shown), it could be observed that the fluorescence anisotropy at very long times tended to zero in buffer solution, and to a small value in zwitterionic membrane (EPC). In addition, the dynamic component was slower for the peptide interacting with membranes than in water solution, and in the case of anionic membranes, even at very long times, the fluorescence anisotropy had a significant positive value. The decay of the anisotropy starts in general at a value lower than the fundamental anisotropy of Trp at the excitation wavelength used, which is r0~0.2 [44]. This is probably due to a very fast wobbling motion of the indole moiety of the Trp residue that is unresolved, especially in the case of the lipid containing samples, due to stronger scattering. For the peptide in buffer, the results of the analyses of the anisotropy decays are shown in Table III. A very fast component (<100 ps) had to be included in the analysis in order to obtain a low chi-square and random distribution of residuals, but because it could not be accurately determined, it is not presented in the Table. The rotation corresponding to the longer rotational correlation time was responsible for the remaining depolarization. In order to determine if this was due to some kind of segmental motion or due to the rotation of the whole peptide, the volume of the peptide was calculated from its molecular mass [45]. In this way, a volume of 3402 \u00c53/molecule was obtained. In Table III the predicted rotational correlation time for a sphere of this volume rotating in water is also shown. It is clear that both at 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C, the experimental value of the rotational correlation time corresponds to a peptide dimer. At these two temperatures the peptide has probably the same molecular organization. This result correlates well with the tendency of the peptide to form aggregates in which a quenching of the Trp residue fluorescence takes place, and that those aggregates are partially or totally destroyed when reaching 50\u00b0C. The fluorescence anisotropy decay in membranes is clearly different from those in water. The parameters retrieved from the analysis of those decays are given in Table IV. It is clear from the data displayed in Table IV that the rotational dynamics of the peptide is different in the several systems. However, the most significant differences (considering the error associated to the parameters majored by 15%, not shown) are a smaller value of r\u221e for EPC, and a longer rotational correlation time for EPA (in the case of EPG, there is a broad surface minimum for which r\u221e could be slightly higher and \u03c6 slightly shorter, which would be effectively closer to the \u03c6 of BPS/EPC and r\u221e closer to BPS; in the EPG system the average lifetime is longer than in BPS and this could also allow a better definition of the dynamic part, and the retrieval of a smaller r\u221e). Focusing on the two major differences mentioned, the anisotropy decay in EPC can be interpreted in a similar way to the one observed in water, but in a medium of higher viscosity (slower rotational correlation time), and also with some hindering (non-zero anisotropy for long times), but the peptide seems to be loosely associated to the membrane. For the other lipids, this is not the case. The rotational dynamics of the Trp residue is severely hindered. Taking the fact that no strong structural alterations in the vicinity of the Trp residue are concluded from the fluorescence intensity decay parameters (Table II), together with the anisotropy decay data, this point to the formation of large aggregates that have only limited motion in the time scale of the fluorescence emission. In the case of EPA, the rotational correlation time is significantly longer. This may be due to the establishment of strong interactions at the level of the small and the less hydrated EPA headgroup that slow down the Trp residue rotational motions as it anchors the peptide at the membrane/water interface. This is fully consistent with the larger spectral shift (low hydration) observed for the peptide in the presence of EPA, but also larger water accessibility (less protection by the small phospholipid headgroup). The KSV value is actually the product of the bimolecular quenching rate constant times the average fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quenching. In this way, it is important to check if there are significant variations in that parameter in order to compare quencher accessibility from KSV values. By dividing KSV (Table I) by <\u03c4> (Table II), it is verified that the water accessibility decreases in the order EPC > EPA > BPS~EPG.",

The extent of leakage observed at different lipid-to-peptide ratios and the effect of lipid composition is shown in Figure 3A, where it can be seen that the peptide was able to induce the release of the internal contents of the liposomes in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of liposomes containing zwitterionic phospholipids, the SARSL peptide induced a significant leakage value, whereas in liposomes containing negatively-charged phospholipids much lower leakage values were found. At the lowest lipid/peptide ratio used, the highest percentages of leakage (49%, 41% and 36%) were observed for EPC, EPC/EPG/Chol (5:3:1) and EPG, respectively. Lower leakage values were found in the presence of EPC/BPS/Chol (5:3:1) (18%) and EPC/EPA/Chol (5:3:1) (5%) (Figure 3A). Interestingly, at the lower peptide/lipid ratio used and more usual in the normal context of protein-membrane scenario, the membrane containing only zwitterionic phospholipid had a significant effect in the probe release (Figure 3A). These results indicate that the peptide affects more significantly membranes containing zwitterionic phospholipids rather than those containing negatively-charged ones.",

            "text": "The fluorescence intensity decay of the membrane probe DPH was obtained in order to evaluate the perturbation induced by the peptide in the membrane hydrophobic core. It was previously verified for other membrane active peptides that a superficial location is also compatible with strong perturbation in the lipid core (e.g., [34]). If the environment of the DPH chromophore is more hydrated this will readily lead to a concomitant decrease of the amplitude-averaged and/or the intensity averaged fluorescence lifetimes. In Table V, the parameters describing the fluorescence intensity decay of DPH are shown for a zwitterionic lipid (POPE), and an anionic one (DMPG). The values were obtained both below (15\u00b0C) and above (35\u00b0C) the main transition temperature of the phospholipids (25\u00b0C for POPE [46] and 23\u00b0C for DMPG [36]), i.e., in the gel and in the fluid phase, respectively, and in the absence and in the presence of the SARSL peptide. In the absence of the peptide, the fluorescence decay of DPH is always bi-exponential, except for DMPG at 15\u00b0C, where a longer component of ~12 ns is the major one, giving rise to a longer lifetime-weighted quantum yield and average lifetime. This corresponds to the gel phase of the saturated phospholipid, for which the order and rigidity is kept deeper along the acyl chains. In the presence of the SARSL peptide, the decay becomes in general more complex. An intermediate component either appears or becomes more important to the total decay, with a consequent decrease of the intensity and amplitude averaged fluorescence lifetimes of DPH. This shows that in all cases, the peptide perturbs the membrane in such a way that it is sensed in the hydrophobic core. The effect of the peptide in the average lifetimes is similar (though lesser) to the effect of the fusion peptide of the SARS-CoV in the same or similar lipids [34]. However, the effect on the lifetime components is different. In the presence of the SARS-CoV fusion peptide the decay was more complex, originating a short (sub-nanosecond) component with an amplitude of more than ~30%, and, e.g., the amplitude averaged lifetime becomes in every case <3 ns. In the case of the SARSL peptide, the stronger effect is felt on the intermediate component, and although this is related to an increase in the polarity of the environment of the DPH fluorophore, there is no direct contact with water (that would lead to a component < 0.5 ns), and in fact the SARSL peptide does not perturb the bilayer structure in a way as drastic as the fusion peptide does, as expected from the proposed function of the fusion and the loop peptides. Another interesting feature is that in the case of the fusion peptide, the relative effect on the average lifetimes was stronger in the anionic lipid both below and above Tm. In the case of the SARSL peptide, it is clear that below Tm, the effect is much more pronounced in DMPG, whereas above Tm, it is in POPE membranes that the effect is more marked.",

For the peptide in solution, the Amide I\u2019 band was quite symmetric with a maximum at about 1646 cm\u22121, implying that the peptide consisted mainly of a mixture of helical and unordered structures [47] (Figure 4A). However, a significant change in the Amide I\u2019 envelope was observed in the presence of model membranes of EPC (Figure 4B) and EPG (Figure 4C). In the presence of EPC, the Amide I\u2019 band consisted of a main band at about 1625 cm\u22121 and a shoulder at about 1642 cm\u22121, whereas in the presence of EPG two bands of similar intensity appearing at about 1641 and 1618 cm\u22121 were observed. Since bands at about 1625 cm\u22121 can be assigned to \u03b2-sheet structures, whereas bands at about 1618 cm\u22121 correspond to aggregated ones, these data would imply that the SARSL peptide structure changed from a mixture of helical and unordered structures to a mixture of helical, unordered and \u03b2-sheet structures in the presence of EPC and a mixture of helical, unordered and aggregated structures in the presence of EPG. These results imply that the secondary structure of the SARSL peptide was affected by the phospholipid composition of the membrane.",

The viral fusion protein of SARS-CoV is the envelope Spike glycoprotein and the S2 domain is the responsible for fusion. Recent studies point to the fact that there are several regions within Class I and Class II membrane fusion proteins which are involved in the interaction with the membrane to accomplish fusion [48\u201351]. Although in other Class I fusion proteins plentiful data have been obtained to understand the implication of these membrane-interacting segments in the fusion mechanism, available information concerning the possible membrane-active regions in coronavirus, and particularly in the case of SARS-CoV, is scarce. Many studies performed to examine the interaction of synthetic peptides mimicking functional regions have been shown to be very valuable in the understanding of membrane viral fusion. Several peptides have been identified in the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein as belonging to membrane interacting regions [14], [16], [19], [20], [34]. In this work we have focused on the possible roles of the loop region in the membrane fusion process. We have selected a specific segment from the SARS CoV sequence which corresponds to the loop region, SARSL, to carry out an in-depth biophysical study aimed at elucidating the capacity of this region to interact and disrupt membranes, as well as to study the structural and dynamic features which might be relevant for that disruption.",

These results were further corroborated by the study of the change in the maximum emission wavelength of the Trp residue, as well as the increase in anisotropy in the presence of model membranes. The greater affinity for anionic phospholipids rather than for zwitterionic ones was already expected, due to the positive net charge of the peptide. The interaction with membrane vesicles decreased the Trp quenching by acrylamide as illustrated by the low KSV values obtained, indicating a low accessibility of the quencher to the peptide. The lipophylic probe quenching results suggest a shallow-to-intermediate location of the peptide in the membrane, but the extent of quenching is relatively low compared to other peptides [19], [52], [53]. This fact and the decrease in fluorescence suggest a possible aggregation of the peptide when bound to the membrane.

Recently, it has been found that the loop region of the gp41 from SIV increases the stability of the trimeric helical hairpin, both in solution and in the presence of membranes [25]; interestingly, mutations in this region almost abolished the formation of syncytia between transfected HEK293T cells and target HeLa-P4 cells [26]. Therefore, the loop region might mediate the interactions between different gp41 trimers facilitating the completion of later steps of the membrane fusion process. The formation of a dimer in solution and larger aggregates in the presence of membranes suggests a similar role of the loop region of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV. Moreover, the formation of aggregates by the SARSL peptide is supported by the FTIR data, being observed an increase of aggregated structures at the expense of the \u03b1-helical structure content in the presence of either phospholipids or the lipid mimetic TFE (not shown).",

Our results would support this notion and add new information about how this region can contribute to the interaction with the membrane. Moreover, the binding of the peptide to the membrane and the modulation of the lipid biophysical properties could be related to the conformational changes which might occur during the activity of the SARS-CoV S protein. Although the peptide is not deeply buried in the membrane, it is able to affect the lipid milieu from the membrane surface down to the hydrophobic core. It is known that, in the case of Class I membrane fusion proteins, several fragments pertaining to different trimers can promote the formation of local nipples in the cell membrane leading to the formation of local bends which could induce zones of non-lamellar phases on the outer leaflet [54]. Therefore, the region where the SARS-CoV SARSL peptide is located could interact with the negatively-charged leaflet favoring the fusion process, and leading to the fusogenic pore formation, similarly to other Class I proteins [28].",

The SARSL would thus have a more primordial role because importantly it interacts strongly and specifically with zwitterionic lipids whereas the SARSFP interacts only weakly and non-specifically (e.g., the Kp of SARSL to EPC is ~106 (Table I) and for SARSFP the interaction was too weak to allow determination of a Kp value [34]. In this way the transverse asymmetry of the target cell membrane, which is challenged by the perturbation induced by the SARSL peptide in the outer leaflet, becomes of major importance for the process. In addition, the perturbation of the membrane is somewhat controlled because the membrane core becomes less hydrophobic (Table V) but not as much as with the SARSFP. This may be important to prevent fusion to occur randomly. SARSL would have a more facilitator and controller role, whereas SARSFP would have a more effector role in the fusion process.",
