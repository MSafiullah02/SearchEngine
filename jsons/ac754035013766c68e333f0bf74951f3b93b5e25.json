Now, that COVID-19 has taken a strong hold in the region, crowded dwellings of the regions' cities can help rapid spread and the migrant populations can help spread from cities to rural areas. COVID-19 will compound the adverse effects of other persistent uncontrolled health threats as the existing resources are being repurposed for COVID-19 mitigation. Such donor-dependent resources are not unlimited. An exit strategy from a pandemic in the region is unlikely, unless in the rare case that some factors play a protective role against COVID-19, including the endemic diseases or their treatment such as malaria treatment, genetic traits such as sickle cell, lack of road network limiting mobility as in DRC, and potential low mortality from COVID-19 because of the demographic distribution of the population (only 5-8% of the population are elderly).",

However, the countries that steered the financing of Ebola response are all severely affected by COVID-19 themselves. Rebel controlled areas with limited or no health systems or lack of economical resilience of the population will challenge the introduction of pandemic mitigation strategies such as social distancing. Population compliance to voluntary mitigation may be limited as the perception of a threat may be dwarfed by the low mortality of CVOID-19, compared to >60% mortality observed for Ebola. Allowing COVID-19 to go unmitigated in the Central Africa Region can exacerbate the ongoing civil unrest and conflict. The reservoir of infections in the region will remain a continuous threat to the rest of the world to seed seasonal and sporadic outbreaks. Emergency action by international, regional and national stakeholders including the U.N. and African Union is urgently needed. ",
