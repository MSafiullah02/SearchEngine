In the extensive population studies of Lebowitz, Burrows, et al,9, 10 encompassing over 2,500 subjects over the age of 20, an antecedent history of childhood respiratory illness was significantly associated with chronic ventilatory impairment. Moreover, they documented an excessive age-related decline in ventilatory function in subjects with this history. An accelerated decline in forced flow rates was apparent even in life-long nonsmokers and suggested that respiratory illness in early life is an important independent risk factor for the development of obstructive airways diseases.",

These studies have shown a surprisingly high incidence of recurrent wheezing occurring in 25 percent to 50 percent of the patients who had acute bronchiolitis in infancy.14, 15, 16 Although these retrospective studies have indicated that such children generally had a high incidence of asthma in first degree relatives, more recent prospective studies have suggested that bronchiolitis may be an important risk factor for obstructive airway disease independent of an atopic or asthmatic diathesis. Kattan and co-workers17 recalled 23 children who had had clinical evidence of bronchiolitis before the age of 18 months and who had remained symptom free for ten years thereafter. Careful pulmonary function testing revealed that the majority of these children had abnormal PaO2, elevated volume of isoflow, and an elevated ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity. Sims and co-workers18 reported follow-up studies of ventilatory function on 35 eight-year-old children known to have RSV bronchiolitis in infancy. They found lower flow rates and greater exercise-induced bronchial lability in these children relative to matched controls. Furthermore, there was no substantial relationship of these ventilatory abnormalities to atopic history. It was concluded that the observed ventilatory impairment was independent of an allergic or asthmatic diathesis.",

A number of physiologic studies have demonstrated alterations in pulmonary function. Picken et al33 documented abnormal frequency dependent dynamic compliance suggestive of peripheral airway abnormalities following rhinovirus infections. In some instances, these abnormalities developed four to eight weeks after the acute onset of illness and did not return to normal for an additional six weeks. Cate et al34 demonstrated diminished steady state diffusing capacity measurements in subjects with rhinovirus infection, felt to be caused by transient bronchiolitis. Fridy and coworkers35 found abnormal closing volumes and diminished density dependent expiratory flow rates in smokers with predominantly rhinovirus disease studied prospectively. In a recent prospective study of young children 2.5 to 11 years of age, uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections were uniformly associated with diminished forced expiratory flow rates.36 This study is of particular importance since other complicating risk factors such as smoking and long-term air pollution exposure would be obviated. A notable feature of virtually all these studies is the protracted duration of physiologic abnormalities, usually averaging from three to eight weeks.",

In addition to observing marked enhancement in bronchial lability, they were able to demonstrate a lowered cough threshold to a citric acid aerosol during uncomplicated influenza A infection. Exaggerated responses to both histamine and citric acid were blocked by prior administration of an atropine aerosol suggesting the response was mediated via a vagai reflex. These authors postulated that epithelial damage associated with viral infections resulted in a sensitization of rapidly adapting airway epithelial receptors.45 These receptors are felt to be subepithelial in location and primarily distributed in larger airways. Extensive work in animals suggests that most, if not all, of the various stimuli known to cause bronchoconstriction and cough in human asthmatics do stimulate these receptors under experimental conditions, resulting in vagally mediated airway response (cough and bronchoconstriction).46 The most characteristic histologic hallmark of viral respiratory infection is some degree of bronchial epithelial destruction. Repair of this epithelial surface requires cellular regeneration. Walsh et al47 performed serial bronchial biopsies in patients with proven influenza A infection. Cellular repair took on the average of five weeks, which corresponds to the mean duration of hyperreactivity noted in these infections.47\n",

It is likely that bronchial hyperreactivity is an extremely early phenomenon following influenza infection and largely independent of the magnitude of \u201cinflammatory\u201d manifestations of this illness. In one series of experiments, we administered the antiviral agent, amantadme, to a group of subjects with documented influenza A infection.48 In previous work, amantadme administration has been associated with accelerated improvement in symptoms in influenza A infection, presumably by inhibition of viral replication. In order to determine the effect of amantadme on physiologic abnormalities, we studied matched groups of young adults with naturally-acquired influenza A infection. Amantadme administration was associated with more rapid improvement in clinical scores compared to controls and an accelerated improvement in density-dependent flow rates, but had no effect on the rate of resolution of airway hyperreactivity to cholinergic aerosol inhalation.48, 49 Amantadme administration, therefore, seemed to ameliorate the viral inflammatory response reflected in changes in density-dependent flow rates. However, the lack of effect on hyperreactivity would suggest that the damage initiating this response occurred early before therapy or is unaffected by therapy.",

Imbalance of the autonomic nervous system has been hypothesized as a mechanism of asthma characterized chiefly by a diminished beta-adrenergic response of bronchial smooth muscle.51 Recently Busse52 studied the effect of intercurrent viral infection on the beta-adrenergic sensitivity of asthmatic patients. He examined the granulocytic response to isoproterenol, which is known to inhibit release of lysosomal enzymes via the cyclic-adenosine monophosphate system. This isoproterenol inhibition was found to be diminished in asthmatic patients compared to normal subjects, and during intercurrent viral infection, the response was further diminished. They suggested that a similar change in beta-adrenergic tone of airways could partially explain the exaggereated bronchoconstrictor response observed during viral infections.",

For example, interpretation of mild obstructive disease or airway reactivity should take into consideration the possibility of an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection. In addition, it is possible that seemingly unrelated airway irritants may be synergistic. For some years, epidemiologic studies have pointed out an association of acute respiratory infection and elevated levels of air pollution.54 Utell and co-workers55 have recently studied the effects on pulmonary function of short-term inhalation of particulate nitrates, a common air pollutant. They found no demonstrable effect either in normal or asthmatic subjects after short-term inhalation. However, when subjects with uncomplicated influenza infection were exposed to an identical nitrate exposure, they uniformly demonstrated transient diminution in forced expiratory flow rates.56 If further studies confirm this observation, the effects of industrial and automotive emissions on lung function may have to be evaluated in the light of their potential synergism with viral infection. This may be of some import when one considers the frequency of colds and exposure to air pollution in our population.",
