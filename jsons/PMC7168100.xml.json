Although the majority of patients recovered after 1\u20132 weeks of debilitating febrile illness, a substantial proportion (up to one\u2010third) developed severe inflammation of the lung, requiring ventilator support and intensive care. Many patients in this group deteriorated into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality of this group of patients is high 3. Manifestations in other organ systems are characteristic. Lymphopenia 4, gastrointestinal symptoms 5, impaired liver function 6, 7, and impaired renal function 8 are common. The possibility of viral infection in multiple organs has been raised and viral replication in the lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract was reported 9, 10. In addition, prolonged shedding of virus was found in some convalescent patients 11. However, chronic infection by SARS\u2010CoV has not, to date, been documented in humans.

Treatment and co\u2010morbid conditions might also modify the pathological changes. Diffuse alveolar damage at different stages of organization is the most consistent finding in the lungs of SARS patients in the terminal stage (Figures 2A\u2013F). Multi\u2010nucleated syncytial cells (Figures 2G and 2H) are characteristic, although these cells are rare. Apart from when secondary infection occurs, the lack of a prominent inflammatory response is also distinctive. SARS\u2010CoV is explicitly detected in the alveolar lining cells (Figures 2I and 2J) 10, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. No specific pathology is identified in the gastrointestinal tract (Figure 3) 5, urinary system 8, or other organ systems 28, apart from that related to end\u2010stage multi\u2010organ failure or those changes secondary to treatment. It is important to note that in some organs such as the liver, while definitive and distinct morphological and functional changes are observed, SARS\u2010CoV may not be unequivocally demonstrable 29.",

The histology of infected lung tissue is similar to that in humans 31, 32, 33. Both acute and organized stages of diffuse alveolar damage were seen when the macaques were sacrificed on the sixth day after a heavy dose of the virus. SARS\u2010CoV was detected in the alveolar epithelial cells and in the intra\u2010alveolar syncytial cells.

In a mouse model of alveolar damage induced by acid aspiration, the balance of the renin\u2013angiotensin system appears to affect the development of DAD. ACE2, which acts as a negative regulator of the local renin\u2013angiotensin system, protects the mouse lung against experimental damage 47, 48. SARS\u2010CoV co\u2010infection in these damaged animals down\u2010regulates ACE2 in the lungs of infected mice and the severity of lung damage can be alleviated by blocking the system 49. Exciting as these findings appear, the case of a new coronavirus, NL63, immediately provides an example that other factors are acting in the overall mechanism of lung damage. NL63 utilizes the same ACE2 protein as its receptor in the lung. However, infection with NL63 results in only minor cold symptoms and alveolar damage is rare 50. The insert/deletion genotype of the ACE gene was associated with DAD after SARS\u2010CoV infection in a small cohort of 44 patients 51. This association was, however, not replicated subsequently in a larger series 52.

Autoimmune antibodies may be important in mediating tissue damage at certain stages of the disease. The cause of the autoimmunity is not fully understood. These autoantibodies may be the result of humoral responses to innate antigens exposed accidentally during direct damage of the lung and, perhaps, the endothelium by SARS\u2010CoV.

The important roles of chemokines are underscored by the findings in an experimental mouse model of SARS\u2010CoV infection in which CXCL10 and a neutrophil chemokine, CXCL8 (chemokine C\u2013X\u2013C motif ligand 8), were also markedly activated 87. These findings in SARS compare favourably with the specific situation in HIV patients with lung allograft rejection and interstitial alveolitis, in which similar activation of the chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 (chemokine C\u2013X\u2013C motif receptor 3) was also found 88, 89.",

Global gene expression profiles, generated by cDNA microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after in vitro exposure to SARS\u2010CoV, also reveal the importance of chemokine activation. Within 1 day after exposure to the virus, a number of chemokines (including CXCL10, CXCL9, and CCL2) were activated 90. PBMCs and macrophages do not support productive infection as viral replication is abortive and no infectious virus is produced. The roles of these cell types in the pathogenesis of SARS remain to be clarified. Nonetheless, these easily obtainable cell types provide convenient experimental models and allow some insight into the patterns of host responses to the infection to be studied. Similar findings were also reported in other cell types, such as dendritic cells, where the cytokine expression profiles are predominantly of inflammatory chemokines CCL3 (chemokine C\u2013C motif ligand 3), CCL5 (chemokine C\u2013C motif ligand 5), CXCL10, and CCL2. Unlike the usual response of dendritic cells to viral infection, anti\u2010viral cytokines, including IFN\u2010\u03b1 (interferon\u2010alpha), IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03b3, and IL\u201012B, were not activated 58.",

The difference in genetic makeup between individuals is mostly accounted for by single base differences (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). Many studies have shown an association between SNPs and predisposition to ARDS, and survival after sepsis or other insults 91, 92. In the context of predisposition to ARDS after trauma, among parameters such as circulating concentrations of IL\u20101, tumour necrosis factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor\u20101 (PAI\u20101), and the genotype of PAI\u20101, insertion alleles at the promoter of PAI\u20101 were associated with high concentrations of PAI\u20101 in the plasma and a poor survival rate 93. In addition to PAI\u20101, other genetic polymorphisms, such as angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE) 94, CD14 95, surfactant protein 96, and HLA genotypes 97, are also associated with predisposition to, severity, and outcome of ARDS. Although SASR\u2010CoV utilizes ACE2 as its receptor and ACE2 is known to be an important protector of lung damage in experimental ARDS, we and other groups found no solid association between alleles of the two ACE genes (ACE and ACE2) and the severity of ARDS after SARS infection 52, 53, 98.",

However, the association of this allele was replicated in another Chinese community of Hong Kong involving 90 SARS patients 100. HLA\u2010B*0703 was found to be a predisposition allele in the latter study. It should be noted that this latter allele is rare and is found in \u223c3% of the general population. Hence, this allele cannot be considered a major predisposition factor for SARS infection 100. Immunogenotype may play a role in determining the severity of host responses. There is considerable variability in the prevalence of immunogenotypes among different populations and the significance of detecting so\u2010called \u2018predisposing\u2019 alleles in clinical practice is questionable.

Understanding the molecular basis of differences in host cell responses to SARS\u2010CoV infection will be crucial in delineating its pathogenesis. It is also clear from clinical and experimental data that host immune responses may be the key determinant in disease progression after initial SARS\u2010CoV infection.
