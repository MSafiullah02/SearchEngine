            "text": "Influenza C is often ignored compared with the other human pathogens in the Orthomyxoviridae family (influenza A and influenza B). With respect to other influenza types, it causes a milder disease with fewer complications and, as it has not been included in routine testing, there is little new information being generated about its impact. In etiologic studies of respiratory illnesses that have included influenza C testing, it usually accounts for a low proportion of acute respiratory pathogens identified. For example, a Canadian study1 found 2.32% of respiratory samples tested from children identified influenza C, while a study in Japan spanning 18 years2 (1996\u20132013) found influenza C in 0.43%\u20131.73% of samples from children; this result was similar to a Spanish study that reported influenza C in 0.7% of children's samples.3 Low rates were reported in a retrospective study Scottish study that screened 3300 respiratory samples collected from children and adults during the period from August 2006 to June 2008 with only six positive influenza C\u2010positive samples (0.2%) identified (with 4/6 from children \u22642 year) compared to 3.2% influenza A detections and 0.9% influenza B detections.4 Higher rates of influenza C infection have been reported in a Nigerian study, where 4.8% of the respiratory samples from children were positive for influenza C5 and Finnish study among young adult male military recruits,6 in which influenza C was identified in 4.2% of all samples. Influenza C can also be identified in a significant proportion of children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections, as reported by Shimizu et al.7 2015, who found approximately 10% of children had influenza C present in samples collected from four Japanese hospitals during 2009\u20132010. Often these cases of influenza C also have other viruses or bacteria detected in the specimen making it difficult to attribute the contribution of influenza C infections to the clinical illness manifestations.5, 8 In contrast to most viral etiology studies, serological studies often find high seroprevalence rates in the community which rise rapidly up to 10 years of age to around 50%\u201360% of the population, indicating that widespread transmission has occurred among children in many different countries.9 Unlike influenza A and B infections where early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitor drugs can be effective, there are no effective antiviral treatments for influenza C.",

From 2001 to 2011, 16 of 9463 (0.17%) human respiratory samples received from the WA sentinel General Practitioner (GP) influenza surveillance network known as SPN(WA)10 tested positive for influenza C by tissue culture or real\u2010time PCR and 63 samples from 4034 samples (1.6%) received between 2008 and 2014 from the Western Australian Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (WAIVE) study11 tested positive for influenza C by real\u2010time PCR. Testing for all WA respiratory samples was performed at the PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA in Perth, WA. The WAIVE study collected nasopharyngeal aspirates from children presenting to the Princess Margaret Children's Hospital emergency department during the influenza season (usually June/July\u2013October), whereas SPNWA collected nose and throat swabs from patients presenting to GP clinics with ILI year\u2010round. Testing for various respiratory pathogens varied between 2002 and 2014 as new tests were developed, but in general, samples were tested for influenza A, B, and C, influenza subtypes, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, and parainfluenza types 1\u20133 by PCR. WAIVE testing also included additional PCR tests for parainfluenza type 4, Bordetella pertussis, human bocavirus, coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63, enteroviruses (including rhinovirus) and human adenoviruses. From 2012 onwards, samples from SPN(WA) were no longer tested for influenza C due to the low detection rates. Further influenza C\u2010positive respiratory samples were obtained from VIDRL, Melbourne, Victoria, during the period 2011\u20132014 when samples were tested for the presence of a panel of respiratory viruses by real\u2010time PCR.",

Primers and a minor groove binding probe were designed using an alignment of influenza C hemagglutinin\u2013esterase\u2013fusion (HE) gene sequences from GenBank. Sequences were downloaded and aligned using the Megalign program of DNAStar (Madison, WI, Australia), and HE primers and probes were obtained (GeneWorks, Adelaide, SA, Australia) and used for the real\u2010time PCR of clinical samples and also for the confirmation of influenza C virus isolates (Table 1). For the real\u2010time PCR assay, RNA was extracted from virus isolates and original clinical samples using the QIAGEN QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions using an elution volume of 60 \u03bcL of viral RNA in water. A one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR assay using the SensiFAST Probe Lo\u2010ROX one\u2010step kit (Bioline, Melbourne, Australia) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using 4ul of viral RNA with 16ul of mastermix, which included 0.2ul of each forward primer and reverse primer, and probe (Applied Biosystems, Australia).

Over the same study periods, the WAIVE respiratory samples had the following ranges of percentage positive samples for influenza A: 7.3%\u201321.9%, influenza B: 0%\u201315.2% and RSV 11.7%\u201321.4%, while the SPNWA samples had ranges for influenza A: 3.1%\u201335.4%, influenza B: 0.3%\u201319.5%, and RSV 0.5%\u20138.0%. For the WAIVE 2014 influenza C\u2010positive clinical samples, there were generally coinfections present with other viral pathogens detected (one other virus = 12 cases, two other viruses = 10 cases, three other viruses = 3 cases, and four other viruses = 1 case) and only 4 (13%) of samples had influenza C infections alone detected (Table 3). The most common multiple infections along with influenza C were with human enteroviruses/rhinoviruses (13 samples), influenza A (seven samples; four with influenza A H1N1pdm09 and three with influenza A(H3N2)) followed by RSV (six samples) and adenovirus (six samples) (Table 3). No clinical details (hospital/ICU admission data) of cases were available from the SPN(WA) study; however, hospital admission data (no ICU data) were available for the WAIVE study. For the entire WAIVE study cohort, 678/4034 (16.8%) of cases were admitted to hospital compared with 7/63 (11.1%) of cases admitted where influenza C was detected. In the WAIVE 2014 study, all of the influenza C cases were obtained from residents of the Perth metropolitan region, with the majority of cases occurring across the Northern and Southern suburbs (Figure S1), but there was no evidence of substantial clustering by residential postcode or place of admission. The non\u2010metropolitan cases were from Broome in the Kimberley region some 2240 km north\u2010east of Perth, and from Kalgoorlie in the Goldfields approximately 600 km east of Perth. The seven ad hoc Victorian influenza C\u2010positive samples (one from 2011, two from 2012, and four from 2014) had an age range from 0.4 year to 54.5 year with two samples (out of six where the age was known) <5 year of age.",

            "text": "This is the first report characterizing influenza C viruses obtained from Australia. Influenza C viruses were detected sporadically in two widely separated states of Australia (Victoria and Western Australia) mainly in the major cities of these states (Melbourne and Perth which are 3420 km apart) during the period 2008\u20132014. The incidence of influenza C appeared to be low in Australia especially from the surveillance performed by the Sentinel GP network (SPNWA) in WA where over a 10\u2010year period only 13 cases of influenza C were detected with a maximum of six cases in 1 year representing only 0.8% of cases swabbed for ILI. Higher levels of infection were detected in the WAIVE program where children \u2264 5 years of age were enrolled. Detection levels in respiratory samples from swabs taken from these children with ILI symptoms reached as high as 5.8% positive for influenza C in 2014 and occurred at the same time as seasonal influenza A (both A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09) and influenza B circulated. The majority of these 2014 influenza C cases also had other pathogens identified in the same respiratory sample by real\u2010time PCR such as RSV, enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, or influenza A with only 4/31 cases (13%) having only influenza C alone detected. A study of young Nigerian children [5] found fewer coinfections with 8/12 (67%) of children having influenza C infections alone and two having coinfections with influenza C and adenovirus or other coinfections with enterovirus (1) or rhinovirus (1). A similar finding was reported in children (0.4\u20132.9 years) in the Philippines, where 7/15 cases (47%) with severe pneumonia were identified as having only influenza C present in their clinical respiratory samples, with six of them being admitted to hospital8; however, this study was based on the identification of coinfections by virus culture and may have therefore underestimated the true level of viral coinfections present, especially rhinoviruses. The high proportion of influenza C specimens in Australian children that were also RT\u2010PCR positive for other respiratory pathogens in the same clinical samples makes it difficult to determine the true role of influenza C in causing these children's illnesses. Interestingly the rate of admission to hospital from those cases with influenza C infections (and possibly with other respiratory viruses) was similar to the overall rate of hospital admissions in the WAIVE study, 11.1% vs 16.8%, respectively. The frequency of large influenza C epidemics in Australia is unknown, but looking at the WAIVE data (Table 2) there is some indication that they may occur approximately every 2 years, as the influenza C cases detected were the highest in 2010, 2012, and 2014. In Japan, it also appears that influenza C epidemics could be detected every couple of years.14\n",

            "text": "The HE protein of influenza C plays a unique role in the influenza C life cycle being responsible for the receptor binding, the receptor destroying enzyme action, and the membrane fusion activities of the virus.16 A phylogenetic analysis of the HE genes of the Australian influenza C sequences showed that of the six reference groups17, the Australian viruses only fell into two of these groups with the majority grouping into the C/Sao Paulo/378/82 clade and a minority of viruses grouping with C/Kanagawa/1/76 clade. Viruses from both Perth and Victoria were found in both of these clades with the viruses from each state often occurring within the same branch and closely grouping according to the year of their collection. The finding of viruses collected in 2008 closely aligning with viruses from 2014 demonstrates the low rate of mutation of the HE gene in influenza C compared with the HA and NA of influenza A and B. A recent report by Odagiri et al.8 2015 on influenza C viruses collected in Japan and the Philippines from 2008 to 2013 found that all 19 influenza C viruses sequenced, belonged to the C/Sao Paulo/378/82\u2010lineage. Interestingly, a study of circulating influenza C viruses in 2014 in Yamagata, Japan17, found both C/Kanegawa/1/76\u2010lineage and C/Sao Paulo/378/82\u2010lineage influenza C viruses in circulation with the C/Kanegawa/1/76\u2010lineage predominating most recently. Pabbaraju et al.1 2013 also found cocirculation of influenza C viruses from these two clades during in a Canadian study conducted with samples collected between 2010 and 2012 from children of less than 10 years of age. In a Paediatric Clinic of the University of Milan, a study over 4 years (2008\u20139 to 2011\u20132) in children under 15 years of age with influenza C and radiographically confirmed community\u2010acquired pneumonia, five cases were identified with two viruses of the C/Kanagawa/1/76\u2010lineage and three from the C/Sao Paulo/378/82\u2010lineage.18 Clearly, viruses from these two influenza C lineages have been the dominant clades seen in many countries in recent years even though they appear to have changed very little based on their HE phylogeny, since they were first reported.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, our sample size was not large enough to be able to gain an in depth understanding of influenza C within Australia. Nor can it determine the level of reassortment that has occurred as the six internal genes have yet to be sequenced. However, Odagiri et al.8 2015 reported that although extensive reassortment was observed with C/Sao Paulo/378/82\u2010lineage viruses, these viruses remained antigenically closely related. The true impact of influenza C infections in children may well vary with age, ethnicity, health status, and the presence of other etiologic bacteria and viruses and may be influenced by the irregular occurrence of epidemics in different geographic locations. While many influenza C cases are asymptomatic and have minimal impact on health services, periodically larger outbreaks occur \u2013 such as the one that was seen in Perth in 2014 \u2013 which may infect substantial numbers of children and possibly immunocompromised or vulnerable populations, which is likely to result in significant morbidity with increased hospital visits and admissions. Hence, influenza C screening should be considered for addition to respiratory screening panels, preferably using real\u2010time PCR or another equally sensitive test, to determine the full impact of this virus on the population, especially young children.",
