Just 2 weeks later, MSF declared the outbreak \u2018of a magnitude never before seen\u2019, and warned that the disease had spread too far to be easily contained (M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, 2015a,b). This warning was borne out when, after months of rapid escalation, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in August of 2014. It was not until 17 months later, in March of 2016, that the PHEIC designation was lifted, after 28 616 cases and 11 310 deaths were recorded in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia (World Health Organization, 2016d).",

The severity of the epidemic compelled numerous multilateral bodies and institutions\u2014including the World Health Assembly, the World Bank and the European Union, among others\u2014to reimagine global health security-strengthening efforts in a post-Ebola context, create new policies and programmes to help counter the perennial threats posed by epidemic disease, and develop new strategies for accelerating country progress towards the health security benchmarks articulated in the International Health Regulations (IHR). However, given growing membership in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and GHSA\u2019s emphasis on monitoring and evaluating progress across its 11 focus areas (i.e. action packages), it remains imperative that these still-nascent, post-Ebola health security initiatives align with and supplement existing efforts to strengthen global health security. Ultimately, monitoring the emergence and progress of these new initiatives will help ensure that vulnerable countries can access resources to develop and sustain the capacities required to counter catastrophic epidemics and achieve positive health outcomes during health crises.",

Next, we used forward- and backward-snowballing methods (i.e. electronic citation tracking and parsing the references of initially identified sources, respectively) to identify additional programmes, initiatives and organizations established in the wake of the Ebola epidemic. We limited our search to English-language documents describing multilateral initiatives that are international in scope, were established directly in response to the 2014\u201316 Ebola epidemic, and focused on improving infectious disease outbreak prevention, detection and response capacities and capabilities. National after-action reports, reports describing country-level post-Ebola initiatives, and documents describing sub-national Ebola response and recovery efforts were excluded. We also excluded efforts spearheaded by philanthropic foundations and non-governmental organizations if they did not involve multilateral partnerships between countries. We deemed that the review reached saturation once our snowballing strategy failed to uncover any new initiatives.",

In cases where information was incomplete or publicly unavailable, we attempted to contact a member of the initiative in question via email. Next, with the aim of identifying remaining gaps in global preparedness and response capacities, we also considered the stated goals of these efforts in the context of global health security capacities documented in the scholarly literature during and after the Ebola outbreak (see Table 2), as well as in the context of each component of the Prevent-Detect-Respond paradigm articulated in the GHSA (see Figure 1).\n",

Furthermore, the difficulty in obtaining accurate and up-to-date financial and operational information is emblematic of a lack of transparency that characterize many actors in global health governance.",

Because our search was largely restricted to English-language grey literature, we may have unintentionally omitted relevant documents describing health security-strengthening efforts helmed by non-Western countries, or analyses of post-Ebola reform efforts authored by researchers from countries directly affected by the epidemic. However, this limitation also reflects a real-world bias, as most of the major post-Ebola health security efforts identified in this study are being led and financed predominantly by Western and high-income countries. Additionally, our review was also restricted to documents made available in the public domain. As a result, we did not have access to financial records, internal memoranda and reports, or other non-public materials that might account for some of the publicly documented funding, workforce, technical and administrative gaps identified in this review\n",

As the initiatives identified in our investigation mature, a future analysis of their impacts on global health security might benefit from additional, complementary modes of data collection, such as interviews with public health leaders in LMIC and systematic reviews of scholarly literature covering these initiatives. As additional countries undergo the Joint External Evaluation process, the results of their assessments might also provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of global health security-strengthening initiatives.
