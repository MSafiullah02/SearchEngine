Due to the emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium parasites, the use of chloroquine to treat malaria has been more restricted. Hydroxychloroquine is also administered to patients with auto-immune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered as safe drugs and the side effects are usually mild and transient. However, it is important to note that the window between therapeutic and toxic doses is narrow. Chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular symptoms and can be life-threatening. Self-treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is therefore not recommended.",

            "text": "A number of clinical trials has been conducted in more than 10 hospitals in China to assess the efficacy of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. In a recent publication,12 it was stated that \u2018according to the news briefing\u2019, \u2018results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course\u2019. However, no data from these clinical trials have yet been released to support this announcement, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions. In France, 26 COVID-19 patients were treated for 6 days with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, three times per day).13 Six of these patients also received azithromycin. Sixteen patients were used as the control group. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured in nasopharyngeal swabs daily during the treatment. During the study, six patients from the treated group had to be excluded and were not considered in data analysis. Three patients had to be transferred to intensive care units, one left the hospital because the patient tested negative, one stopped treatment due to side effects and one person died during the treatment. The authors reported clearance in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs in 57% of chloroquine-treated patients compared to 12.5% of untreated patients at day 6 post-inclusion in the study. In addition, a synergistic effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was suggested, because all patients treated with this combination cleared viral RNA by day 6 post-inclusion. However, as not all patients entered the study at the same stage of the disease, it is difficult to assess whether the clearance in viral RNA was due to the treatment or due to the immune system of the patient. Furthermore, the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin is associated with severe QT prolongation and should thus be considered with care. Before chloroquine can be considered safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19, more studies are needed.",

The incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate in the growing viral RNA chain will result in chain termination and therefore halt viral RNA replication. Despite potent efficacy in Ebola virus animal models, remdesivir was less efficacious in a clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo.15",

Treatment with intravenous remdesivir was initiated on day 11 of illness. On illness day 12, the clinical condition of the patient improved. Supplementation with exogenous oxygen was stopped. Although encouraging, the apparent success of remdesivir treatment in this one patient does not prove that the drug is effective.

Whether HIV protease inhibitors might also inhibit the coronavirus protease remains a question, because the HIV protease belongs to a different protease family from the two coronavirus proteases (aspartic vs. cysteine protease family, respectively).19 Furthermore, HIV protease inhibitors were specifically designed to fit in a certain pocket of the HIV protease dimer, but this pocket is not present in coronavirus proteases. Antiviral activity of LPV/r against SARS-CoV-1 was reported in cell culture,20 but conflicting results were reported for MERS-CoV.7,21 In common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV, LPV/r was able to improve the clinical outcome and reduce viral loads in the lungs.22 However, in a MERS-CoV mouse model, the prophylactic use of LPV/r in combination with interferon-beta only slightly reduced the viral loads in the lungs without impacting other disease parameters.17 Therapeutic treatment of LPV/r with interferon-beta improved the pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology. In SARS-CoV-1-infected patients, results of the treatment with LPV/r were inconclusive.23 In addition, two case reports describing MERS patients receiving LPV/r in combination with ribavirin and interferon-alpha reported conflicting results.24,25 The preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 patients is thus modest.",

Despite the rather weak scientific base for the use of favipiravir as an anti-coronavirus drug, clinical trials with favipiravir have been conducted in China. In an open-label, non-randomised controlled study, 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were treated with oral favipiravir (day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; days 2\u201314: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily).30 In the control group, 45 patients were treated with LPV/r (days 1\u201314: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation. Both treatments were continued until viral clearance was confirmed or until 14 days after the start of treatment. The median time of viral clearance for the patients treated with favipiravir was 4 days, which was significantly shorter than the time for patients in the control group with LPV/r (11 days). The report of this study does not clarify in which type of samples viral clearance was studied. Chest computed tomography scans improved in the favipiravir-treated group (91.4% vs. 62.2% in the LPV/r treated group).",

Arbidol is an antiviral drug with activity against influenza virus infection that is approved in Russia and China.31 The primary outcome of this study was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 after start of treatment, which was defined as recovery of fever, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and cough relief for at least 72 hours. A non-peer-reviewed report on this study describes that in COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms (fever and respiratory symptoms without difficulties in breathing), the clinical recovery rate at day 7 was higher in the favipiravir-treated group when compared to the arbidol-treated group (71.4% vs. 55.9%). Furthermore, the time of cough relief and fever reduction by favipiravir was significantly shorter than that by arbidol. However, for COVID-19 patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, the clinical recovery rate was not significantly different between both groups (54.8% vs. 51.4%). The same picture was observed for critically ill COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that favipiravir might be useful for patients with mild symptoms, but not for severely ill patients.",

Clinical trials should thus be designed with care, because robust results are essential. In addition, transparent and complete reporting on these clinical trials is needed to allow independent assessment of the potential benefit for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the selection of therapies to be evaluated in clinical studies needs to be based on clear scientific in vitro and preclinical in vivo evidence.
