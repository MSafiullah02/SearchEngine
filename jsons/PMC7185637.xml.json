            "text": "Acute upper respiratory tract viral infections (URTIs) are the most common diseases of human beings, with adults having two to five common colds each year and school children having from seven to ten colds per year.1 The symptoms of URTIs are so common that self-diagnosis of common cold or influenza (flu) is normal among the general public and clinical diagnosis is usually the only diagnosis used by the physician. Over 200 serologically different viral types are responsible for human URTIs, with the rhinoviruses being the most common cause.1 There is a large amount of information available about the molecular biology of the viruses associated with URTIs but relatively little information on the origins of the symptoms associated with them. An understanding of the pathophysiology of symptoms of URTIs is important, as most treatments for URTIs are symptomatic and clinical trials on the efficacy of new treatments usually focus on changes in symptom scores as the main parameter of efficacy rather than changes in viral titres in the airway or viral shedding. Clinical trials on any new antiviral treatment for URTIs aimed at the general population will need to demonstrate changes in symptom severity or duration of symptoms, since these parameters are the key benefits for most patients. Differences in clinical presentation are not so useful in identifying the causative agent of an URTI but there has been increasing interest in improving the accuracy of symptomatic diagnosis of emerging viral infections such as pandemic influenza2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)3 because early diagnosis is essential for any antiviral therapy and for the initiation of public-health measures in the community (eg, isolation of infected cases). Here, I discuss the mechanisms that generate symptoms associated with URTIs, especially common cold and flu, but will not review virology in any detail except as regards relevance to symptoms.",

The sneeze response may be mediated via histamine receptors on the trigeminal nerves, since intranasal administration of histamine causes sneezing.23 The trigeminal nerves relay information to the sneeze centre in the brainstem and cause reflex activation of motor and parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve and activate respiratory muscles. A model of the sneeze reflex is illustrated in figure 1\n. The sneeze centre coordinates the inspiratory and expiratory actions of sneezing via respiratory muscles, and lacrimation and nasal congestion via parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve. The eyes are always closed during sneezing by activation of facial muscles, indicating a close relation between the protective reflexes of the nose and eyes. A common phenomenon is the \u201cphotic sneeze\u201d, caused by a sudden increase in light intensity, again highlighting the overlap of protective nasal and eye reflexes.24 Sneezing activates parasympathetic pathways to nasal glands and there appears to be some cholinergic control of sneezing, since anticholinergics such as ipratropium and first generation antihistamines have been shown to inhibit sneezing.25, 26\n",

This early phase of nasal secretion is a reflex glandular secretion that is caused by stimulation of trigeminal nerves in the airway, similar to sneezing. Support for the glandular origin of the early nasal secretions comes from studies on anticholinergic medicines such as ipratropium. These studies have demonstrated that nasal secretions in the first 4 days of a common cold are inhibited by intranasal administration of ipratropium.25 The nasal discharge also consists of a protein-rich plasma exudate derived from subepithelial capillaries,28 which may explain why anticholinergics only partly inhibit nasal discharge associated with URTIs.27\n",

Much of the literature relates to colour changes in sputum and the lower airways but the same concepts apply to the upper airways and nasal discharge. The colour of nasal discharge may change from clear to yellow to green during the course of an URTI. This colour change is related to the recruitment of leucocytes into the airway lumen and is a hallmark of airway disease.30 Neutrophils and proinflammatroy monocytes have azurophil granules that are green because of the green protein myeloperoxidase. Nasal discharge with few leucocytes is white or clear, with increasing numbers of leucocytes the nasal discharge appears yellow (pale green), and with large numbers of leucocytes the colour becomes green.30\n",

The nasolacrimal duct has been shown to have a vascular plexus of veins (cavernous tissue) similar to the venous sinuses of the nasal epithelium, and congestion of this plexus causes obstruction of the duct.41 The nasolacrimal cavernous tissue is innervated by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves that may have a role in controlling the outflow of tears by regulating the congestion and decongestion of the cavernous tissue.42\n",

            "text": "Cough is a common symptom associated with URTIs that may persist for 3 weeks or more,43 and it represents the largest single cause of consultation in primary care.44 Cough is mediated exclusively by the vagus nerve, meaning that cough is initiated in the airway by stimulation of sensory nerves at the level of the larynx or below.45 A model of cough control is illustrated in figure 3\n. Nasal stimulation and inflammation causes sneezing and not cough, indicating that the airway inflammation associated with rhinitis must reach the level of the larynx to trigger cough. The vagus nerve also supplies the external ear, oesophagus, and abdominal organs and cough can be elicited from these areas as with cough associated with gastroesophageal reflux.44 Cough is normally a protective reflex that prevents the aspiration of food and fluid into the airway and also aids in the expulsion of mucus and foreign objects from the lower airway. The first days of an URTI are often associated with a dry, unproductive cough that serves no useful function and may cause loss of sleep and exhaustion. The unproductive cough may be caused by the inflammatory response in the upper airways spreading to the larynx. Cough associated with URTIs is believed to be caused by a hyper-reactivity of the cough reflex that may be due to the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway sensory nerve endings.46, 47 In health, cough is readily induced by mechanical stimulation of the larynx, but when the larynx is inflamed and hyper-reactive, cough may occur spontaneously or in response to stimuli that would not normally cause cough\u2014eg, the mildly irritating effects of cold air. Cough occurs spontaneously with an URTI, and some cough may be voluntary rather than reflex; this voluntary cough may be related to a sensation of airway irritation.48 Productive cough usually occurs later in the course of URTI and may be related to the inflammation spreading to the lower airways and triggering mucus production. Common cold viruses usually do not cause any substantial damage to the airway epithelium,11 whereas influenza may cause substantial cellular damage to the respiratory epithelium; this difference may be why influenza infection is usually associated with cough2 whereas common cold often occurs as a \u201chead cold\u201d with little, if any, symptom of cough.",

Common cold in the adult is rarely accompanied by fever and some subjects have a transient fall in body temperature during the early stages of common cold. In a study of 272 patients with sore throat associated with URTIs, the mean aural temperature was 36\u00b78\u00b0C and around 35% of these patients said they were suffering from \u201cchills\u201d and \u201cfeverish discomfort\u201d.49 The sensation of chilliness may be unrelated to any change in skin or body temperature. In a study of human volunteers, a sensation of chill still develops on administration of exogenous pyrogen even though the volunteers are immersed in a water bath that maintains a neutral skin temperature (34\u00b75\u00b0C).53 The sensation of chilliness occurred after visible signs of shivering in the volunteers. Chilliness and shivering occurred even though there was no change in skin temperature and body temperature was actually rising in response to skin vasoconstriction. This finding indicates that the sensation of chilliness may be a central sensation closely linked to control of shivering. Chilliness and shivering are most likely induced by the effects of cytokines on the temperature regulating centres of the hypothalamus and perceived at the level of the cerebral cortex.",

The unpleasant symptoms of fever, malaise, and anorexia help to overcome infection and it is debatable whether elimination of these symptoms with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is beneficial.
