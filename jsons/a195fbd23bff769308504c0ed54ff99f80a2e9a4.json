The location of these structures in the genomes of RNA viruses is often coordinated with specific processes in the viral life cycle, where the presence of the structure acts as a checkpoint for deciding the eventual fate of the process. These structures have been found to adopt complex conformations and exert their effects by interacting with ribosomes, multiple host translation factors and small RNA molecules like miRNA.

These structures are composed of basic building blocks formed by simple helices and loops that associate with a number of ways to generate a variety of tertiary structures. Many viral genomic RNAs are reported to assume a highly complex, extensive and dynamic structural landscape, during different stages of their life cycle as illustrated from studies on dengue virus [6] . This landscape is studded with many RNA structural modules or units that play critical roles in regulating different stages of translation from initiation to termination. The past two decades have witnessed a steady progress in the studies involved in identifying the presence of such RNA structures in viruses. While a combination of chemical-probing techniques and highthroughput sequencing have yielded the entire 'structuromes' of viruses like HIV-1 [7] , continuous efforts employing X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have shed light on various relatively well-defined, smaller RNA structures that are located in specific regions of viral genomes, for example 5 /3untranslated regions (UTRs), coding regions, overlapping genes, etc. [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 697, "end": 700, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1160, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1469, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "While many viruses carry their own enzymatic machinery for autonomous genome replication, transcription, genome assembly and packaging, they completely lack the translational apparatus required for protein synthesis. Apart from the limitations posed in terms of their utter dependency on host translation machinery, viruses are also under tremendous selective pressure to optimize their coding capacity due to their small genome sizes. In order to evade the multiple immunity barriers of their host cells, viruses have evolved countermeasures of their own to disrupt the host's antiviral mechanisms. As a result, they possess highly sophisticated strategies by which they bypass the normal translation process of their host to recruit the translation apparatus in alternative ways. Furthermore, the different types of mRNAs that are synthesized in viruses exhibit various features that determine the kind of alternative translation they are involved in. For example, the presence or absence of a 5 -cap or a cap-substituted structure in which, unconventional 5 -moeities cap viral mRNAs instead of m7G (7-methyl Guanosine [9] ), presence or absence of poly-A tails at 3 -end and finally presence of a range of tertiary structures in either 5 /3 -UTRs, intergenic or coding regions. These alternative translation schemes fall under an umbrella term 'Non Canonical translation' strategies.

As the mRNAs of many positive sense RNA viruses do not possess this cap structure, the canonical signatures for the recruitment of 40S subunit of ribosome are absent. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element is an RNA sequence present in either 5 -UTRs (example-Picornaviridae family) or intergenic regions (example-Virgaviridae family) of some viral mRNAs that recruit the ribosome at an 'internal' position for translation, in a capindependent manner (Figure 1 ). These sites were first identified in poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus mRNAs, which possessed unusually long 5 -UTR regions with multiple noninitiating AUG codons scattered throughout this sequence [14, 15] . These sequences were proposed to fold in order to adopt highly organized, complex RNA structures that were capable of recruiting ribosomes to initiation 'AUG' codons internally on mRNAs that lacked a conventional m 7 G 5 -cap. Since their discovery, various IRES elements have been identified in the genomes of other RNA virus families, the best characterized examples belonging to Dicistroviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae [16] as well as cellular mRNAs, from both bioinformaticsbased predictions and experiments [17] . Viral IRES elements are broadly divided into four groups depending on their secondary structure, involvement of eukaryotic translation factors and distance between IRES element and start codon. Group I IRES-RNA structures bind to the ribosome directly in absence of any protein factors and initiator methionyl-tRNAi [18] [19] [20] . Group II IRES-RNA structures bind to 40S subunit directly along with certain initiation factors like eIF2/3 and Met-tRNAi [21, 22] . Group III and IV IRES-RNA bind ribosomes in presence of additional IFs and proteins described as IRES trans-activating factors (ITAFs) [23, 24] . Most of the available structural information about known IRES-RNA structures comes from groups I and II as they directly bind to ribosomes. On the other hand, due to a gap in our understanding of the mechanism by which ITAFs interact with IRES sequence/structure motifs to recruit ribosome, not much is known about IRES belonging to groups III and IV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 952, "end": 956, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1393, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1483, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1806, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1811, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1816, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1945, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1946, "end": 1949, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2091, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2092, "end": 2095, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 733, "end": 742, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Internal ribosome entry sites"}, {"text": "Recent computational analyses on data from high-throughput IRES activity assays have attempted to bridge this gap, by employing supervised machine-learning algorithms [25] . In the structure from group I IRES belonging to viruses in Dicistroviridae family, three pseudoknots I, II and III and two conserved stem-loops IV and V were found to interact directly with the ribosome [26, 27] . The different stem-loop segments in fulllength IRES structures are often brought together by longrange tertiary interactions like pseudoknots, kink-turns and A-minor interactions (Figure 2A , B) as identified by studies nearest AUG codon to start translation. (B) \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting: an RNA pseudoknot or a stem-loop present in the overlapping genomic region stalls the actively translating ribosome and induces a shift in the reading register, so that downstream translation can be resumed from a new reading frame. (C) Ribosomal shunting: an extensive RNA structure located between a short and a long ORF shunts the 40S subunit of the ribosome between the two ORFs. (D) Stop codon readthrough: RNA structure that is located between two ORFs prevents the reading of the cognate stop codon and releases factor binding so that translation can be continued. (E,F) Reinitiation and non-AUG initiation: in reinitiation, upstream sequence motifs [termination upstream ribosome binding site (TURBS)] interact with 40S subunit to reinitiate translation. In non-AUG initiation, the RNA sequence and/or structure stimulates reading of a near-cognate start codon by the ribosome. on hepatitis C virus (HCV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus [28] [29] [30] [31] . In 2013, a full-length structure of an IRES element from HCV at atomic resolution was presented [32] , which combined data from small angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulation for generating a model structure for HCV IRES. The study used the data from available cryoelectronmicroscopy (cryo-EM) maps of ribosome-bound IRES structures to assemble and fit the atomic resolution structures available for its constituent modular units. The study illustrated that full-length HCV IRES is composed of many extended structured regions that are connected by flexible linkers, such as four-way junctions and pseudoknots [32] . Molecular dynamics simulations have also been used for studying the conformational plasticity of individual IRES domains, dynamics involved in the folding of separate modular units of IRES element from HCV and its dependence on Mg 2+ /Na + ions [33, 34] . Viral genomes display high genome variation that is reflected in their 5 -and/or 3'-UTRs and also causes variation in the IRES elements. Such variation in the IRES elements for HCV genome has been documented in HCVIVdb [35] database, which could be used for deducing the effect of sequence variations on different structural domains. Database like IRESite [36] houses the complete list of experimentally and computationally annotated IRES sequences from a broad range of eukaryotic viral and cellular sources ( Table 1 ). The IRES sequences have been found to be poorly conserved among different viral families, although sequences within a single family have shown similarity to a certain level [37] . The low sequence homology among different viral families poses a further bottleneck in in silico IRES prediction using BLAST searches [17] . However, the IRES elements do show similarity at the level of their secondary structure with many sequences adopting an extended structure composed of multiple stems and loops ( Figure 2 ). The similarity found at the level of secondary structures can be used for comparative structural alignment of predicted secondary structures with known IRES elements and could provide a basis for de novo IRES prediction. This strategy is used by programs like IRSS [38] and online prediction server VIPS [39] , which were developed to predict IRES, based on secondary structure prediction using minimum free energy methods [40, 41] and subsequent structure alignments using RNALFold [42] (Table 2) . More recently, a new IRES prediction tool had been developed for searching these sites in eukaryotic and viral genomes based on support vector machines, called IRESPred [43] , and employs \u223c35 classifiers including predictions of secondary structure [44] and interaction probabilities between 5 -UTR sequences and proteins from the small ribosomal subunit [45] (Table 2) . However, many of these programs that were developed into web servers like VIPS, IRSS and IRESPred are not maintained anymore. IRSS, however, provides useful downloadable Perl and R scripts for carrying out secondary structure prediction and comparative analysis. We have mentioned these programs, nonetheless, in order to highlight the chronological progress in development of approaches and algorithms that led to increase in our understanding of these elements.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 171, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 377, "end": 381, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1630, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1635, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1640, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1645, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1748, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2274, "end": 2278, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2530, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2531, "end": 2534, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2760, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2893, "end": 2897, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3232, "end": 3236, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3373, "end": 3377, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3835, "end": 3839, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3874, "end": 3878, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3993, "end": 3997, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3998, "end": 4001, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 4053, "end": 4057, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4239, "end": 4243, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4319, "end": 4323, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4425, "end": 4429, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 567, "end": 577, "text": "(Figure 2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3048, "end": 3055, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3558, "end": 3566, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4058, "end": 4067, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4430, "end": 4439, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Internal ribosome entry sites"}, {"text": "Frameshifting is a recoding mechanism, first described in Rous sarcoma alpha retrovirus where the gag-pol genes were found to be co-expressed from a single polycistronic transcript [46] . Frameshifting is widely used by retroviruses for efficient replication of their genomes and infection [47, 48] . Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) can occur when the ribosome is systematically guided to express open reading frames (ORFs) that are shifted by \u22121 (Figure 1 ), \u22122 [49] or +1 [50] reading register with respect to each other. It has been reported recently that organisms other than viruses also employ frameshifting to express the overlapping ORFs [51] [52] [53] . \u22121 PRF process per se is coordinated by three key determinants: a 7 nucleotides long 'slippery-site', a 5-9 nucleotides long spacer sequence and an RNA structure that could be either a simple stemloop or a pseudoknot. Several studies have reiterated the fact that an RNA pseudoknot is a more efficient stimulator of frameshifting than a structurally simple hairpin loop [54, 55] . According to Recode V2.0 database, a large number of viruses use an H-type pseudoknot for efficiently mediating \u22121 PRF process [56] . In single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV) [57] , Luteoviridae (sugarcane yellow leaf virus) [58] and Astroviridae [59] families, \u22121 ribosomal frameshift has been found to be modulated by RNA pseudoknots. The retroviruses (HIV-1, HTLV-2) [60, 61] display involvement of both pseudoknots as well as extended hairpins in the process [62] . The H-type pseudoknots consist of two helical stems (named S1 and S2) interspersed by two or three loops (named L1, L2 and L3) [8] . Crystallographic and NMR studies have suggested that the two helical stems in these H-type pseudoknots are twisted and bent with respect to each other [63] [64] [65] , as observed from the solution structure of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot where the two helical stems showed a bending angle of \u223c121 \u2022 [66] ( Figure 2D ). This kink/hinge arises mainly due to a single nucleotide in loop 2 that intercalates itself between the helical stems, thus preventing co-axial stacking of the two helices. The loop and stems interact through multiple non-canonical hydrogen bonds involving the sugar edge of stem nucleotides and Watson-Crick face of loop bases, thus providing added mechanical strength to the structure [8, 67] . The structural features of frameshift inducing RNA pseudoknots have been discovered mainly by NMR [66, 68] , crystallographic [69] and molecular dynamics studies [70, 71] , which also highlight the importance of ions and ion-coordinated water molecules in holding such a compact structure together. The physical significance of the presence of a kink in frameshift inducing structures is important as it was observed that structurally simpler hairpin structures also displayed a kink between their helices [72, 73] although the helices in these hairpins were larger than the constituent helices of retroviral and luteoviral pseudoknots [72] ( Figure 2C ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 185, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 290, "end": 294, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 472, "end": 476, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 655, "end": 659, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 660, "end": 664, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 665, "end": 669, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1046, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1050, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1184, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1260, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1332, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1548, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1681, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1839, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1844, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1849, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2411, "end": 2414, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2415, "end": 2418, "text": "67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2523, "text": "[66,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2524, "end": 2527, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2547, "end": 2551, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2583, "end": 2587, "text": "[70,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2588, "end": 2591, "text": "71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2931, "text": "[72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2932, "end": 2935, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3057, "end": 3061, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 456, "end": 465, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2020, "text": "Figure 2D", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3064, "end": 3073, "text": "Figure 2C", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Frameshifting"}, {"text": "PRFdb [74] catalogs the programmed ribosomal frameshift signals filtered from Yeast Genome project and Mammalian Gene Collection [75] . As is the case with IRES elements, RNA structures (pseudoknots/hairpins) share little sequence similarity among different viral families, although within a subgroup the sequence signals do exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation, as was observed for retroviruses. The length of these structures vary from the tightly compact polerovirus and enamovirus pseudoknots (<30 nucleotides) to extended coronaviral structures (>200 nucleotides). This renders their in silico prediction extremely difficult. Recent studies have been devoted to search for existing PRF signals and develop predictive rules for identification of novel signals, not only in viruses but also across different domains of life, e.g. KnotInFrame [76] and FSFinder [77, 78] . These algorithms employ a set of rules in which a preliminary screening of putative frameshift sequences is done based on consensus slippery sequence motif (X XXY YYZ) followed by secondary structure prediction on filtered sequences using minimum free energy programs like pknotsRG [41] and RNAFold [40] (Tables 1 and 2) . While some algorithms can predict stem-loop frameshift structures (FSFinder), others take into account the pseudoknot stimulators in \u22121 PRF (KnotInFrame). The accuracy of the prediction of novel \u22121 frameshift signals could be further augmented by the fact that overlapping regions from different RNA viral sub-groups show high sequence similarity, a feature that could be used to increase the reliability of secondary structure prediction ( Table 2) . Apart from these predictive programs, databases like FSDB [78] store all the experimental and predicted frameshift hotspots, and RECODE-2 [56] houses all the information related to translation recoding events and signals involved. Programmed frameshifting is also utilized by prokaryotic and mammalian genomes for translating multiple products from same set of ORFs. FSscan [79] predicts such +1 frameshift signals in Escherichia coli. A remarkable feature that has been observed in case of \u22121 PRF inducing RNA structures is that relatively smaller structures like RNA pseudoknots from MMTV and other viruses can act as ribosomal roadblocks and induce \u22121 PRF.

It was first discovered in plant pararetroviruses in the family Caulimoviridae and subsequently in rice tungro bacilliform virus [RTBV, a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)-related plant pararetrovirus] [82, 83] . It was found that the mRNA (also pregenomic RNA, pgRNA) leader sequences in the members of this family were unusually long. The long leader sequences folded into a large stem-loop structure and contained several small ORFs (sORFs) (Figure 1 ). Different chemical and enzymatic probing studies have shed light on the architecture of this structure. In CaMV, a sORF and a strong downstream hairpin constitute a minimal shunting element. In CaMV, the 40S subunit along with a complement of initiation factors assemble at 5 -cap of mRNA, scan for a short 60-70 nucleotides downstream till an AUG codon of the proximal sORF. All the scanning ribosomes assemble at this codon to form complete 80S subunit. After initiating translation of the first sORF and release of the newly formed short peptide, the 80S ribosomes disassemble. A fraction of the remaining 40S ribosome then shunts (bypasses) over the downstream 500 residue-long sequence that assumes a thermodynamically stable structure and consists of multiple sORFs (Figure 1 ). After shunting, the scanning continues for a short distance downstream until the nearest start codon of the first large ORF and translation is reinitiated [84] . Chemical and enzymatic probing studies suggest that the shunting structure present in the 35S leader sequence of pgRNA of CaMV alternates between a long-range pseudoknot, connecting central and terminal parts of leader and a hairpin dimer at high ionic strength [85] . Shunting is believed to expand the coding capacity of mRNA by directing the ribosomes to inter-nal coding regions by bypassing upstream sORFs. The shunting mechanism is employed by all genera of plant pararetroviruses, late adenovirus mRNA and animal viruses [86, 87] and is found to be conserved in all plant pararetroviruses, making it a widely used strategy of non-canonical translation. Computational identification of a shunting element in rice tungro spherical virus, RTBV and CaMV revealed that the leader sequences were highly rich in GC content [88] . RNA secondary structure prediction using earliest dynamic programming algorithms like Mfold [89] (for thermodynamic parameters used to derive free energy values, see [90] ) on the pgRNA leader sequences of these viruses suggested presence of a structure containing several stem-loops, which were found to be present in both the optimal and sub-optimal structures. The upper portion of these structures was capable of adopting various different conformations, as highlighted in recent review [86] . The shunt efficiency was determined by the stability of the helix located at the base of structure [88] .

The termination process not only depends on stop codon sequence but also on the proximal contextual sequence with some bases resulting in a significantly 'leaky' stop signal [93] . These leaky codons allow 'read-through' of the translating ribosome ( Figure 1 ). In this process, the stop codon is recognized by near-cognate suppressor tRNA that allows translation to proceed and terminate at the next stop codon [92] . In many ssRNA viruses belonging to Luteovirus (Luteoviridae family), Alphavirus (Togaviridae family) and Tobamovirus (Virgaviridae family), programmed readthrough takes place, resulting in a C-terminal extension of the initial protein. This extension often encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or an extension to the coat protein [94] [95] [96] . Like programmed frameshifting, the efficiency of programmed readthrough is also modulated by features located in the 5 -and 3 -end of the suppressed stop codon, such as adenosine residues in the region immediately 5 of the stop codon [97] . However, it is the presence of many sequence and structural features in the 3 -end of the stop codon that stimulates and enhances the readthrough efficiency. These signatures fall into three major classes, group I, II and III, out of which viral readthrough signals belonging to group II and III contain an RNA secondary structural element [96] . In type I motifs, readthrough across a UAG codon is stimulated by a six nucleotide motif having a consensus sequence of UAG CAR YYA (R = purine, Y = pyrimidine) and are mainly present in tobamoviruses to allow translation of polymerase [98, 99] . Type II motifs consist of a UGA stop codon followed by CGG or CUA and an extended stem-loop structure \u223c8 nucleotides downstream [100] . Type III motifs consist of a UAG stop codon and purine-rich octanucleotide spacer sequence followed by an RNA structure that has been found to be an RNA pseudoknot in cases of gammaretroviruses [98, 101] . Apart from these classes, a novel type of readthrough signature in RNA viruses was identified recently in ORF5 of potato leafroll virus (Luteoviride family), which consisted of a C-rich region in the vicinity of coat protein stop codon and a distal RNA stemloop structure \u223c640 nucleotides downstream of this 'leaky' stop codon.

However, in certain incidences, the 40S subunit remains associated within the message and reinitiates translation at a downstream AUG codon [114] (Figure 1 ). This happens when translation has terminated at very short (usually <30 codons) ORFs that can give rise to 40S subunits capable of scanning and reinitiating translation at a downstream AUG codon [115] .

Presence of these residues constitutes an optimal sequence context for canonical translation initiation to take place [124] . Leaky scanning can be stimulated when the AUG codon is located very close to 5 -end of the UTR, particularly when the length of UTR is <15 nucleotides [125] . When the two AUG codons are located in close vicinity to each other (<6 nt separation), the potential for leaky scanning increases [126] .

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of whole-genome studies like Frag-Seq and PARS, accompanied by empirical structural modeling tools to come up with an accurate model of IRES elements [129] in Picornaviridae [37, 130] . Studies of a similar magnitude are still required for investigating the structures involved in \u22121/+1/\u22122/+2 ribosomal frameshift, stop-codon readthrough, shunting and reinitiation. Although getting a secondary structure map of entire genomes from high-throughput sequencing is now a routine process, inferring the long-range tertiary interactions from secondary structure components still remains a challenging task. Moreover, even the large-scale viral genomic maps, yielded by chemical probing data such as SHAPE, provide an incomplete picture, since protein induced dynamic structural changes are not taken into account in these analyses [131] .

A recent in vivo analysis of RNA conformational dynamics in Zika virus [139] has revealed the vast and fluid conformational landscape of entire RNA genomes. The observations from these studies combined with state-ofthe-art computational RNA-folding algorithms could provide a stepping stone to predict RNA tertiary structure folding and long-range interactions that could vastly improve our current understanding of the mechanism by which various RNA structures modulate translation in viruses. There has been a steady rise in the development of bioinformatics pipelines along with aforementioned high-throughput structure probing algorithms; a few, but in no way comprehensive, examples being Mod-Seeker [137] , StructureFold [140] and dStruct [141] , along with excellent reviews describing these and other pipelines [142, 143] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 615, "end": 620, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 639, "end": 643, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1296, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1408, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1446, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1535, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1748, "end": 1753, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2009, "text": "[133,", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2014, "text": "136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 2174, "end": 2179, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2248, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2458, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 3087, "end": 3092, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 3109, "end": 3114, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 3127, "end": 3132, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 3201, "end": 3206, "text": "[142,", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3211, "text": "143]", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Insights from high-throughput RNA structure probing"}, {"text": "Nearly all the non-canonical protein-coding strategies used by viruses have been found to be employed by eukaryotes as well. With increasing instances of such mechanisms being identified in yeast and mammals, efforts have redirected towards exploiting features of these mechanisms towards biotechnological and biomedical purposes. The ability to recruit the ribosome at an internal location, independently of cap-recognition and 5 -UTR scanning events, by IRES structures has serious biotechnological implications. The IRES elements have been used for expression of synthetic bi-cistronic [144] and multi-cistronic [145] constructs to express proteins of desire in a number of experimental setups. However, the lack of any global sequence conservation across different viral families poses technical challenges in designing effective sequence constructs for in vitro experiments. Recent computational studies employing RNA inversefolding methods, which involve designing a sequence capable of assuming a desired reference structure, have proved to be valuable tools in de novo IRES predictions [146] . Algorithms developed for inverse folding are being developed, keeping specific scientific goals in perspective. They range mostly from heuristic methods, which focus on providing optimal sequence sets using user-specified constraints iteratively until a desired target structure is achieved [147] , to probabilistic approaches like INFO-RNA [148] and methods employing statistical mechanical sampling schemes, reviewed in [149] .
