Draxxin (100 mg/mL tulathromycin; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) is approved for control of BRD in beef cattle, nonlactating dairy cattle (including dairy calves), and veal calves at high risk of developing BRD associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Although government agencies encourage less use of antibiotics in livestock (Weese et al., 2015), the metaphylactic use of tulathromycin in commingled dairy calves has been reported to lower the incidence of diarrhea, otitis media, and BRD and improve growth (Stanton et al., 2010, 2012, 2013) and suggested to possibly reduce antibiotic resistance (Weese, 2006). In calves over 2 mo of age and metaphylactically treated with TUL at approximately 3 d of age, TUL increased ADG and reduced the incidence of diarrhea and otitis media (Stanton et al., 2013). In calves metaphylactically treated with TUL versus oxytetracycline at approximately 2 mo of age, ADG and withers height change were increased to approximately 3.2 mo of age in calves that had not been treated for disease, and the incidence of respiratory infection was reduced (Stanton et al., 2010, 2012). Other peer-reviewed research with TUL in young dairy calves was not found.",

Significant stressors in the life of a calf include castration, dehorning, weaning, commingling, and vaccination (Hulbert and Mois\u00e1, 2016), and these stressors frequently occur after 3 wk of age when respiratory disease is most prevalent. Stressors combined with the presence of viruses allow bacterial colonization of the lungs and are a typical reason for the onset of respiratory disease (Yates, 1982). A common outcome of BRD in calves is decreased weight gain and wither height. Indeed, Stanton et al. (2010) showed that calves that developed BRD before 8 wk of age experienced decreased weight gain and wither height. Detection can be difficult but critical to treatment, and recovery from the disease can affect performance later in life. This was demonstrated in a study with 795 Holstein calves where identification and treatment of disease before 2 mo of age improved first- and subsequent-lactation milk production (Heinrichs and Heinrichs, 2011).",
