            "text": "Inpatient evaluation of children with stridor often involves surgical intervention with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (DLB) to assess for the presence of subglottic and lower airway pathology. In addition to stridor, obstruction may manifest as difficulty to extubate or acute respiratory distress. These signs are often due to fixed airway lesions, inflammatory or infectious processes or a combination of both. Because patients can have a complex presentation, acute decompensation or increased work of breathing can be suggestive of not only laryngotracheal pathology but also underlying upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The presence of a URTI has been shown to increase perioperative morbidity and may in turn increase the risk of DLB [1,2]. As pediatric otolaryngologists, we are faced with the decision to proceed with surgical intervention or postpone until the resolution of URTI symptoms. However, the safety of DLB in acutely ill pediatric patients is not well described.",

Presentations can vary, ranging from failure to extubate to stridor and respiratory distress. Acute processes can arise from infectious processes and can mimic static airway lesions. In clinically complex scenarios, our institution uses rapid viral testing to help establish the clinical picture and determine the urgency of intervention as acute viral respiratory infection can increase perioperative risk of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, reintubation. Thus, a positive test may lead to medical management with steroids and close observation whereas a negative test may result in earlier operative intervention. We sought to explore these practices by examining the peri-operative outcomes of patients undergoing DLB with a recent history of viral testing. Interestingly, our study showed no association between respiratory viral positivity and increased complications among children undergoing inpatient DLB. Overall rates of complications were low in spite of nearly 74% of procedures performed on ASA fitness class III/IV patients. Nearly one-half of encounters underwent intervention due to concerns for structural airway abnormality. Anatomic airway abnormalities were more common in RVP negative patients; they were diagnosed on DLB in over one-half of RVP negative encounters and one-third of RVP positive encounters. Despite viral panel result, concurrent endoscopic intervention was common, performed in nearly 30% of patients overall. We identified that while minor complications are common (oxygen desaturation occurred in almost half of all patients), they responded to minimal intervention (oxygen supplementation). The only major complication observed were laryngospasm and the need for reintubation. No other major complications were noted in this study.",

Cohen and Cameron found that patients with URTI were more likely to experience respiratory-related complications [1]. However, timing of infection in relation to surgery was not established and the study relied on symptoms for URTI diagnosis. Further, Tait et al. studied adverse respiratory event incidence and risk factors for patients undergoing elective surgery who were asymptomatic, had active URTI, or had recent (past 4 weeks) URTI [4]. They determined that there was no difference in incidence of laryngospasm and bronchospasm, but active and recent URTI patients had more overall events, as well as more breath-holding spells, oxygen desaturations (SpO2 < 90%), and severe coughing events compared to children without URTI. Still another study found that patients with a history of URTI in the previous two weeks had a 3.5-fold increase in prevalence of respiratory complications [8].",

            "text": "The heterogeneity in findings within the literature may be attributable to different methods used to establish URTI diagnosis. The diagnosis is often defined by the presence of symptoms reported by the parent/guardian of the patients or within the patient\u2019s medical record [11]. Studies have found an increased risk of complications by using symptom history 30 days prior to surgery and also by evaluating symptoms at 2 weeks prior to surgery [12]. This study, with data on both symptoms and objective RVP assessments, as well as an analysis of the time interval between viral infection and bronchoscopy was designed to address these limitations. We found that symptom-based URTI criteria were met in 20.5% of encounters compared to a URTI diagnosis rate of 45.5% when RVP was used. Interestingly, 25.0% of RVP positive encounters were deemed URTIs based on symptoms alone and 16.7% of RVP negative encounters met symptom criteria for URTI. As a result, symptom-based URTI definitions do not appear to be a reliable measure for estimating RVP findings. The relatively low rate of symptom-based diagnosis compared to RVP-based diagnosis could be due to the RVP\u2019s ability to identify the DNA of a viral pathogen that is present but not causing clinically concerning symptoms. The low correlation between the two tests might be a result of the symptoms being caused by a disease process other than upper respiratory tract infection in the hospitalized patients. Furthermore, the symptom-based diagnosis results could be confounded by comorbid conditions and are limited by what was documented in the electronic medical record. In another study, Parnis et al. found that just 4.8% of patients that reported symptoms had a virus isolated on an immunofluorescence assay. Neither the patients who had URTI in the preceding 6 weeks nor the patients who tested positive for a viral pathogen had an increased probability of anesthetic complications [6].",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the retrospective nature of this study limits the characterization of perioperative outcomes to what is available in the medical record. In this study, patients were excluded if they did not have an RVP recorded within 6 weeks of DLB, were readmitted close to birth, required a tracheostomy, or had multiple surgical interventions beyond the airway. This was to create a sample that better represented those undifferentiated patients who present to the hospital with respiratory distress and do not have extremely complex healthcare needs that could contribute to adverse surgical outcomes. In doing so, our limited sample size may not have sufficient power to show any associations between RVP positivity and surgical complications should they exist. The outcomes of this study were not intended to apply to medically complex children or patients with known airway abnormalities. However, DLBs were performed in select patients for whom RVP was positive when medically indicated, specifically for those patients whose overall status warranted a surgical procedure despite a known URTI. Surgeons often elect to proceed to the operating room in order to visualize the patient\u2019s airway and determine the etiology of obstruction. In this way, this study population does not represent patients presenting for elective surgery for whom surgery is delayed due to suspected URTI. Additionally, only patients who had an RVP taken were compared. The decision to order RVP testing is typically made by emergency department personnel or primary treatment team. These patients received this test because there was a concern for infection causing acute respiratory distress, although RVP is not typically ordered for straightforward URTI. RVP is deferred in patients with high suspicion for structural abnormalities or known airway pathology and low concern for viral illness. Patients with positive RVPs are spared of inappropriate antibiotics and receive proper transmission-based precautions to prevent spread of infections [13,14]. If the RVP is negative, the provider must consider alternative etiologies leading to respiratory distress. It is possible that patients in both groups had a bacterial or viral pathogen not tested for on the RVP. It is also expected that there were patients who received DLB but were not able to be included because the RVP test was not administered.",
