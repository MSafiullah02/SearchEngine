Although gene variants of CC chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1) have been reported, the protein expression of CCR1 in patients with BD remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the frequencies of CCR1 + cells in a herpes simplex virus-induced mouse model of BD. The frequencies of CCR1 + cells on the surface and in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The CCR1 + cells were significantly down-regulated in BD mice compared with the normal control and symptom-free control mice. Colchicine and pentoxifylline treatment improved the symptoms of BD and increased the frequencies of CCR1 + cells in BD mice. Treatment with chemokine CC motif ligand 3 (CCL3), a ligand of CCR1, caused BD symptoms to deteriorate in 10 of 16 BD mice (62\u00c15%) via down-regulation of CCR1 + cells. Anti-CCL3 antibody treatment ameliorated BD symptoms in 10 of 20 mice (50%) and significantly decreased the disease severity score compared with CCL3-treated BD mice (P = 0\u00c101) via up-regulation of CCR1 + cell frequencies.
