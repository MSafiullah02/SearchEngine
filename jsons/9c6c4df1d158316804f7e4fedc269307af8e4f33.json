Methods: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis c and hiV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available.",

Briefly, we analysed the costs of exports of aPi from india using the online tracking database Panjiva [34] , which shows details of all shipments of aPi with quantities and costs per kilogram. We used all available costing data for each drug aPi found on Panjiva, excluding shipments <1kg in size, alongside the lowest and highest 15% of results based on prices per kg. a 5% aPi loss during tableting process was factored into our calculations, and a conversion cost of Us $0.01 per tablet was used. a multiplier based on aPi mass was applied to account for the price of excipients, which are additional substances needed to convert aPi into FPP. Our estimated aPi costs presume that production is carried out by a generic provider of aPis, where associated costs of capital investment, overhead and labour are not as high as for production by originator companies.",

There can be volume-price guarantees to procure large amounts of drugs at fixed prices for a set number of years.
