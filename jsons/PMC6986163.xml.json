            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe diffuse lung injury characterized by significantly impaired oxygenation and lung compliance that frequently leads to mechanical ventilation [1\u20133]. ARDS is common, accounting for 10 to 15% of intensive care unit admissions and 200,000 patients a year in the US [4, 5]. In a large observational study, the mortality rate of moderate to severe ARDS was up to 40% [4]. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) have been proposed during the early course of moderate to severe ARDS especially in those with PaO2/FIO2 < 120 mmHg to improve oxygenation and reduce patient-ventilator dyssynchrony [6\u20138]. NMBA facilitates oxygenation in various studies [9\u201311] by various mechanisms, including reducing ventilator-induced lung injuries and inhibiting inflammatory cytokines [12, 13]. An early, short-term continuous infusion of cisatracurium, an NMBA, was evaluated in a large multicenter randomized study (ACURASYS trial), and evidence of its survival benefits in ARDS was found in an anticipated post hoc analysis of patients with PaO2/FIO2 < 120 mmHg. NMBA, however, could be associated with muscular weakness and the need of more sedatives [6, 14, 15]. Of note, besides NMBA use, increasing evidence of other supportive treatments for ARDS patients such as sedation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy, and prone positioning has been developed since major data on NMBA were published [16\u201318]. The question of whether NMBA is effective is still unknown. Recently, the largest randomized controlled trial on NMBA in early ARDS patients was published to reassess the effect of an early, short-term continuous infusion of cisatracurium (ROSE trial), and no survival benefit was found [19]. This result was different from major studies published previously on the same topic [9\u201311].",

We further form meta-regression models to assess for potential heterogeneity for the following factors: PaO2/FIO2 ratio (P/F ratio), baseline PEEP, predicted mortality, PEEP strategy, and prone positioning. Predicted mortality was based on available studies on SOFA score (first in full text) and SAPS II (first in full text) score [24\u201326].

All of the studies included patients within 48 h of the ARDS diagnosis with a cut-off PaO2/FIO2 ratio mostly below 150 mmHg with the exception of Forel et al. (cut-off below 200). Guervilly et al. only randomized patients with moderate ARDS and PaO2/FIO2 between 100 and 150 mmHg. The pooled data for the baseline respiratory parameters had a PEEP (cmH20) of 11.68 \u00b1 3.74 and a P/F ratio of 104 \u00b1 32.50. The baseline demographic and respiratory parameters (PEEP, PaO2/FIO2 ratio) were not statistically significantly different between the NMBA group and the control group. The ARDS causes mostly include pneumonia (59%), followed by aspiration, extrapulmonary sepsis, other causes, and lung contusion (17%, 14%, 9%, and 1% respectively).\n",

Although neuromuscular blocker has been widely used, there is still a concern regarding their use in clinical practice [37], especially when concomitant use of corticosteroids for severe septic shock could have an additive effect with NMBA [14]. Our finding of no risk of ICU-acquired weakness is likely because of the short duration of neuromuscular blocker of only 48 h in all the studies. Of note, only one study by Gainnier et al. did not use corticosteroids in the first 5 days. Other studies used corticosteroids in 5 to 45% for septic shock but there is no difference between the corticosteroids use when we compare between the NMBA group and the control group (OR 1.13; 95% CI, 0.89\u20131.44; p = 0.14).",

The largest trial also gave cisatracurium to a percentage of patients in the control group and was stopped early due to futility before a sample size with an adequate power was reached. Regardless, trials that stopped early for benefit do not have strong evidence of causing a substantial bias in the evaluation of the treatment effects [38]. Because of these limitations, the quality of evidence was judged to be only moderate. The second limitation was that we could not obtain the ICU mortality in the study of Moss et al. so we could not draw a conclusion about this particular outcome.",

The clinical management of ARDS patients is still a complicated field that considers multiple other factors. In clinical practice, NMBA still has a benefit of improving oxygenation and reducing barotrauma without increasing ICU weakness. However, it is noted that this benefit of oxygenation is not observed until 48 h. In fact, NMBA may not be necessary for the purpose of mortality reduction, when there is an implementation of high PEEP with appropriate protocols to decrease PEEP, light sedation in combination with prone positioning and low tidal volume ventilation.",
