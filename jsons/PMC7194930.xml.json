The investigators isolated the SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal sample of a patient with confirmed COVID-19. After successful culture on Vero-E6 cells (a line of African green monkey kidney cells), the isolated virus was sequenced by next-generation sequencing and showed the prototypic coronal shape of viral particles by electron microscopy. The investigators then infected the Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 and examined the effect of human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) added to the culture milieu. They found that exposure of infected cells to hrsACE2 during the first hour, followed by washing and incubation without hrsACE2, significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication 15 hours post infection. This inhibition was dependent on the initial quantity of the virus in the inoculum and the concentration of hrsACE2, establishing dose-dependency. In contrast to hsrACE2, mouse recombinant soluble ACE2 did not inhibit the infection. Because the virus has a size of 80 to 100 nm, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 must first infect blood vessels prior to local tissue infections, the investigators went on to infect human capillary organoids with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate. After demonstrating active viral replication in this experimental model, they found that the addition of hrsACE2 markedly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, because ACE2 is strongly expressed in tubular epithelium, the investigators examined the effect of hrsACE2 in kidney organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells. They first demonstrated ACE2 expression and active SARS-CoV-2 replication in organoids composed of proximal tubular cell and podocyte clusters. They then added hrsACE2 to the culture medium and found that it reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner. What is still lacking is the demonstration that hrsACE2 can also protect pulmonary cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Figure 1\npresents a schematic view of the renin-angiotensin system, emphasizing ACE2 with its 2 molecular forms, membranous and soluble, and their putative role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection and virus trapping, respectively.",

Conversely, inactivation of ACE or angiotensin II AT1 receptor protects the lung. Genetic variation in ACE level has also been reported to be a prognostic factor for ARDS in humans. The balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 may play a role in alveolar function in disease, with angiotensin II exerting deleterious and angiotensin 1-7 beneficial actions, but this remains to be further studied.

(Left, middle) The physiological steps of the generation of angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 and their actions on specific receptors are shown. Angiotensin II is generated from angiotensinogen by the actions of renin and subsequently anchored to ACE in the cell membrane. ACE2, another transmembrane enzyme, removes the carboxyterminal amino acid of angiotensin II, thereby inactivating angiotensin II but generating angiotensin 1-7 with biological activity distinct from angiotensin II. Angiotensin 1-7 activates the Mas receptor. (Right) The interaction of circulating SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 is depicted. Membrane-bound ACE2 serves as the exclusive (or at least main) SARS-CoV-2 receptor, allowing host cell entry and infection via virus binding to the S1 domain of the viral Spike protein. In addition to its full-length transmembranous form, ACE2 also exists in soluble form (sACE2) in the circulation, lacking its membranous anchor. According to recent studies, increasing bioavailability of sACE2 by administering recombinant human sACE2 may act as a virus trap and inactivator.5,6",
