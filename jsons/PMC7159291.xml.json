As a global demographic and economic giant, China's prominence in global health should not be surprising. With 18% of the world's population, China weighs heavily in all global health metrics, such as life expectancy, disease burden, and health systems. As the world's largest trading nation, its movement of goods and services is associated with transfer of health technologies, diseases, and risk factors. In health knowledge and strategies, China has a rich history of traditional medicine and has pioneered many health-care innovations.",

In the first millennium, knowledge of medical cures were transmitted by the Silk Road that facilitated exchange between China, India, the Middle East, and Europe.9 In the 20th century, some Chinese health crises such as the Manchurian plague epidemic captured the attention of neighbouring countries of the international community.10 China has historically been the origin of many infectious epidemics and a source of key health innovations of breakthroughs such as the barefoot doctor (a term that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, which refers to farmers who received minimal basic medical and paramedical training and worked in rural China to promote basic hygiene, preventive health care, family planning, and treat common illnesses. The name comes from southern farmers, who would often work barefoot in the rice paddies), and artemisinin, an effective antimalaria drug developed from plant-based Chinese traditional medicine.11, 12\n",

First, health aid aims to advance global health equity. It is the traditional area of official development assistance (ODA) coordinated by organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) countries. Second, global health security should be ensured by management of interdependence in global health and mutual protection against shared and transferred risks, such as epidemic diseases. Third, health governance is needed for global stewardship to set ground rules as mediated by health diplomacy. Fourth, knowledge exchange is needed, which includes the sharing of lessons and knowledge production, ownership, and application worldwide. Knowledge centrally affects all four pillars of global health, and global health governance is recognised to be central to all four domains (figure 1).",

First, in 1963, China sent its first overseas medical team to Algeria, followed 6 years later by the donation of its first hospital in Tanzania.17 The explicitly articulated purpose of China's health aid was to further political solidarity as part of China's foreign policy. Second was China's economic openings after 1978, which launched the dramatic transformation of China from a low-income to a middle-income country, leading to China qualifying as an aid recipient followed by increasingly becoming an aid donor.17 Third, starting from 2000, China has hosted a series of Forums on China-Africa Cooperation, with each forum announcing yet another major aid pledge\u2014eg, hospital construction, malaria control, and high education scholarships (2007\u201309); training of health workers and artemisinin drug donation (2010\u201312); and brightness action (eye care) campaign (2013\u201315).18, 19 Fourth, global engagement greatly accelerated after 2001 when China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), an event that marked China's joining almost all international bodies. Finally, and perhaps most dramatically, the 2003 severe acute repiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic underscored both China's neglect of its health sector and the reality that China's global trade cannot be done without mutual health protection.20\n",

The largest share of health aid is spent on medical teams and donated facilities. The financial value of Chinese in-kind health aid is difficult to estimate. Crudely, from 2007 to 2011, we estimated the value of Chinese medical teams in Africa to be about $60 million annually, with donated facilities at a similar amount. Total health aid to Africa annually has been estimated at about $150 million. Understanding of the type of health support offered rather than the precise volume of funding might be more important. Different from most OECD donors, China does not offer general sectoral support, albeit small cash grants given to several countries in recent years. Its health aid uses a project approach.7 The in-kind provision in the five categories is based on Chinese competencies. Health seems to constitute only a small proportion of the total Chinese aid. Health aid is mainly in donation form, whereas most of China's overall foreign aid is offered as either concessional or interest-free loans.",

But a professor of Chinese traditional medicine from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine is leading an unprecedented effort to eradicate malaria on the Comoros Islands with traditional Chinese medicine. Starting in 2007 on Moheli Island where 23% of the 36 000 residents were carriers of Plasmodium falciparum, disease prevalence has dropped to 0\u00b73% in 4 months with mass administration of artemisinin and piperaquine, donated by China's ministry of commerce. 5 years later, the Chinese team extended this programme to Anjouan, an island of 350 000, reducing the prevalence of P falciparum carriers from 19% to 0\u00b75%. Last year, the efforts were expanded to the 420 000 residents of Grande Comore, the country's largest island.

A comprehensive analysis of this question would need access to data not currently available. As a preliminary first step, we attempted to examine correlations between health aid and commercial economic indicators. Regression analysis of African countries with variables of health aid (medical teams, donated facilities, malaria control) and economic interests (petroleum imports, China's foreign investment, and China's imports and exports) yielded no significant pattern. Figure 4\nshows four scatter-plots of China health aid and African trade. In the four diagrams, individual African countries are plotted according to health and commercial indicators. The scatter-plots did not show any association between medical aid and economic interests. Spearman's Rank Correlation and t test analysis for the period of 2002\u201311 showed no significant findings of correlations. These preliminary analyses should not be interpreted as conclusive.",

China's health aid volume is small, but the mode is distinctive, driven by China's health capabilities and national experiences. Unlike many other traditional donors, China's in-kind aid focuses more on some important aspects of the health system. China's overall global engagement follows a very different path from developed countries partly because it has no colonial experience nor did it participate in shaping the American-led post-World War 2 world order. China was inward-looking until it expanded into the global economy in 1978. Over the ensuing three decades, China has had large shifts from a low-income to a middle-income country, and from aid recipient increasingly to aid donor. The spread of its foreign aid throughout the breadth of Africa presumably reflects both efforts to solidify friendship politically, promote mutually beneficial economic gains, and compete with Taiwan for political friendship.68 China's health aid is embedded in the dynamic shifting of foreign and economic policies. The opening in 1978 marked a shift from economic development serving foreign policy to foreign policy serving economic development because China's association, for example, with Africa, has developed from a political one in the 1970s to a broader economic-based and trade-based engagement.69, 70 These are all defining characteristics of China's engagement in global health.",

The records show that China respects and complies with rules governing multilateral institutions in all affairs\u2014health, trade, migration, environment, and other aspects of global governance. China has increased its contribution to multilateral funding pools, such as the Global Fund from $2 million per year in 2003, to $5 million per year in 2012. How important China will become as a major donor to these pooled funds is uncertain. Some see the early actions as symbolic gestures of cofunding, whereas others hope that the size of the Chinese economy will propel it to become a financial leader of multilateral funds. The New Development Bank being established by BRICS countries aims to compete with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which is one example of how China has debatably played a leadership role.72\n",
