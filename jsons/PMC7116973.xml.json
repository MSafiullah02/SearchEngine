They are prevalent and tend to affect those who are more vulnerable, such as children, elderly, and people living in developing areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.1 The advent of molecular techniques has facilitated the identification of respiratory viruses in patients with pneumonia and has shed a light on how commonly these viruses occur in patients with pneumonia. With the currently available diagnostic tools, viral pathogens are more often identified than bacterial pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia.2 A large amount of effort is currently being dedicated to elucidate the pathogenicity of respiratory viruses and the interaction between viruses and bacteria in the setting of pneumonia. Since the last century, a number of devastating pandemics and outbreaks related to respiratory viruses have occurred.3, 4 Recently, there has been a growing interest in the development of new antiviral medications for respiratory infection. In this article, we provide an overview of pneumonia caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses from the practicing clinician perspective and with a focus on the adult population.",

Influenza A virus is subcategorized into subtypes such as H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 based on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Influenza B is subcategorized into the B/Yamagata and the B/Victoria lineages.3, 5, 6 Most influenza infections are caused by types A and B.7 The gene mutation that influenza undergoes every year is called antigenic drift and is responsible for seasonal outbreaks. Conversely, influenza pandemics are caused by antigenic shift, which occurs when new hemagglutinin or neuraminidase subtypes are acquired.7\n",

The capsid has a large cleft (or canyon) that binds to adhesion molecules on the cell surface, leading to the eventual entry of the viral genome into the cell. The capsid and the adhesion molecules are potential targets of antivirals17, 18 (Table 1\n).",

Although the presence of a viral infection did not significantly increase the risk of short-term death, patients with dual bacterial-viral infection had twice the risk of death as compared with patients without dual infection.19 It is important to note that the identification of a viral pathogen in a patient with pneumonia does not necessarily mean that the virus has a pathogenic effect, particularly if the identification is via nasopharyngeal swab (Fig. 1\n, Table 2\n).",

However, viruses of the Herpesviridae family also tend to cause infection in immunocompromised patients.

Most of these deaths occurred in patients younger than 65 years old.29 In 2003, a major outbreak of atypical pneumonia was reported. The cases initially clustered in China but were subsequently reported worldwide. The pneumonia often resulted in acute respiratory failure and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome.30 Subsequently, the etiologic agent of this disease was identified as a novel coronavirus,31, 32 which was named the Urbani strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus.31 In 2012, another novel coronavirus was isolated from a patient with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.33 The virus was subsequently named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.34 Infection by this virus causes an illness that is clinically similar to that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus but with higher mortality.35 Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus were initially reported in Saudi Arabia but were subsequently reported in other countries, including the United States, typically in persons who had traveled from the Arabian Peninsula.36, 37, 38\n",

As an example, the absence of coughing and temperature higher than 37.8\u00b0C make influenza very unlikely in patients presenting with influenzalike illness outside an influenza epidemic but has a lesser impact on the likelihood of influenza if the same patient presenting during an epidemic. On the other hand, the presence of these symptoms during an epidemic substantially increases the probability of influenza but has a lesser impact outside of an epidemic.74\n",

Some of the earlier studies were limited by retrospective design, leading to potential classification bias, or by the reliance on clinical manifestations for the final diagnosis of influenza, leading to incorporation bias.75 More recent studies used a prospective design and viral polymerase chain reaction test as the reference standard. A prospective study enrolled 100 patients with influenzalike illness who presented to 3 different clinics. Viral polymerase chain reaction test was used for the diagnosis of influenza. The accuracy of a number of symptoms was tested. On multivariate analysis, only cough and temperature remained significant predictors of influenza.76 In a prospective study of 258 patients who presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory symptoms, a symptom inventory and influenza polymerase chain reaction test was applied to the patients. Using polymerase chain reaction test as the reference standard, the accuracy of clinical judgment, decision rule, and rapid influenza test was provided. The presence of cough and fever had a positive likelihood ratio of 5.1 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.7.72 In a prospective study of 270 high-risk patients who presented to an emergency department with acute respiratory illness, clinicians were asked whether they thought the patient had influenza. Viral polymerase chain reaction was the reference standard. A clinician diagnosis of influenza had a positive likelihood ratio of 1.63 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.82.77 Likelihood ratios are an interesting way of providing the accuracy of symptoms or clinical diagnosis because they allow for the estimate of the probability of a disease after taking into account the pre-test probability78 (Fig. 3\n).

Symptoms or clinical impression are not enough to rule in or rule out influenza. In fact, clinicians failed to clinically diagnose influenza in approximately two-thirds of influenza-confirmed patients in a prospective series.77 Ultimately, clinicians need to pay close attention to surveillance data, and if there is evidence of influenza activity in the area where they practice, any acute febrile respiratory illness should place influenza as a high possibility in the differential diagnosis. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide weekly data on influenza activity according to regions in the country. This is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm. Other important aspects of clinical history include close contact with persons with acute febrile illness, and recent travel. Additionally, it is important to realize that in some tropical countries, influenza circulates throughout the year.79\n",

For the assessment of time to alleviation of symptoms in adults with influenza, 8 studies were pooled, totaling 2208 patients in the oseltamivir group and 1746 in the placebo group. Oseltamivir led to earlier relief of symptoms (16.8 hours; 95% CI 8.4\u201325.1 hours; P < .001). For the assessment of pneumonia prevention in adults with influenza, 8 studies were pooled, which included 2694 patients in the oseltamivir group and 1758 in the placebo group. Oseltamivir led to a reduction in pneumonia (risk difference of 1% [0.22%\u20131.49%]). For the assessment of hospitalization prevention in adults with influenza, 7 studies were pooled that included 2663 patients in the oseltamivir group and 1731 in the placebo group. There was no difference in need for hospitalization (risk ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.57\u20131.5; P = .73).

This comes at the expense of more nausea and vomiting. It should be noted, however, that the patients included in these trials did not appear ill. For instance, studies that enrolled patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus infection or malignancy were not included in the meta-analyses. The inclusion criteria for the pooled studies were the presence of influenzalike illness rather than pneumonia.

For instance, case reports and series have reported the use of cidofovir for the treatment of severe pneumonia caused by adenovirus in non-immunocompromised patients.96, 97 Even though patients had clinical improvement in these series, those studies were uncontrolled and thus do not allow a firm conclusion as to the efficacy of cidofovir. Antiviral treatment for pneumonia caused by viruses of the Herpesviridae family in immunocompetent hosts has been reported in severe cases.98, 99 In pregnant women with varicella zoster virus pneumonia, the mortality is high, and treatment with intravenous acyclovir is indicated.100\n",

Although no statistically significant improvement in mortality was observed in general, corticosteroids led to a reduction in mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (risk ratio 0.39; CI 0.20\u20130.77).112 Corticosteroids may be particularly beneficial in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and heightened inflammatory state, as demonstrated in a trial that enrolled patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia and a C-reactive protein greater than 150 mg/L.113 In summary, despite the small sample size of most trials, the weight of evidence currently favors the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the hospital, particularly in patients with a high inflammatory state and severe pneumonia.

It is also common in immunosuppressed patients, but the latter are susceptible not only to the usual community-acquired respiratory viruses but also to viruses of the Herpesviridae family. Recent data show that respiratory viruses are also identified in hospital-acquired infections. The clinical diagnosis of viral infection is challenging. Clinical prediction rules have been developed for the diagnosis of influenza infection but they showed only modest accuracy. Similarly, radiological studies are nonspecific. In the end, the diagnosis of viral infection relies on the recognition that respiratory viruses are commonly present in pneumonia, and on the systematic performance of viral microbiology studies, particularly nucleic acid amplifications tests. The treatment of influenza pneumonia is currently with a neuraminidase inhibitor. The treatment options for pneumonia caused by other viruses in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia are limited, and the data are largely anecdotal. In immunosuppressed patients with infection by respiratory syncytial virus or a virus of the Herpesviridae family, there are antiviral treatments available. There is ongoing research involved with the development and testing of new treatment strategies both for influenza and noninfluenza viruses.",
