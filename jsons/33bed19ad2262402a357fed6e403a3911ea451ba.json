COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are higher among older individuals 2 . However, no breakdown of recovery periods is available for different patient age groups in large population cohorts. Such knowledge may improve our understanding of COVID-19 and assist healthcare system readiness for future coronavirus epidemics or pandemics. Our study aimed at assessing the effects of age and sex of Israeli COVID-19 patients on their rate of recovery, applying datamining of a large dataset of 5,769 recovered Israeli patients released to the public on April 28, 2020 by the Israel Ministry of Health.",

            "text": "We analyzed a public dataset released on April 28 th 2020 by the Israel Ministry of Health (https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19). The dataset listing recovered patient demographics includes anonymized records of 5,769 Israeli patients (3,370 men and 2,399 women). Age groups are shown in this public dataset according to decades for the age range of 20 to 59 years, while for younger or older patients age groups are assigned as 0-19 years or as over 60 years. Recovery is defined by two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 throat swab test results. Time from infection to recovery is measured as number of days from first positive to first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result. Statistical significance of differences in the recovery times between patient groups were compared using two-way ANOVA as described in the Figure and Table legends. Group differences with p<0.05 were considered significant. Table 1 shows the time for recovery by patient sex and age group according to the Israel Ministry of Health dataset of recovered patients released on April 28, 2020 and the differences (days) between group recovery periods. Figure 1 presents (a) average recovery times in each age group for male and female patients and (b) average recovery times for male and female patients aged 0-29 years or >30 years. As shown, male and female patients aged >30 years had significantly longer recovery periods compared with younger patients (FD=0.95, p<0.0001 and FD=0.97 days, p=0.038, for men and women, respectively). These differences, while statistically significant, may seem small. Yet, they allow a conclusion that younger individuals, in addition to be less and it has been suggested that this may reflect the fact that androgen hormones, which have higher plasma levels in men compared with women, drive the transcription of TMPRSS2, the gene coding for the protease essential for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry following the biding of its spike protein to cell membrane ACE2 9 .",

Yet, it seems reasonable to assume that the heavy workload during this period did not affect the observed between group differences, so that the recorded times between the first positive to first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results may serve as proxy of time to recovery. In favor of this, all SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in Israel (at time of writing this report) is done by the same RNA extraction and PCR specifications as coordinated by the Israel Ministry of Health COVID-19 emergency team.",

However, given the average recovery times of between 13.239 to 14.814 days (Table 1; lowest for women under 19 years and highest for men aged 50-59 years, respectively) it is clear that severe COVID-19 cases are not included in this dataset. Indeed, severe cases were reported to be discharged from hospital on average 8 days longer than mild-to-moderate patients requiring hospitalization 4 . A separate Israel Ministry of Health public dataset shows symptoms severity at first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; however, as all records are anonymized there is no option for comparing individual patient symptoms at first positive test with their recovery periods. Women are less likely than men to have severe acute respiratory distress (ARDS) or fatal outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,8 . The reasons for this sex difference remain unclear,",
