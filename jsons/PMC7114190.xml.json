            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which originated in early November 2002, in the Guangdong province of People's Republic of China, posed a great global threat. A total of 8422 cases have been reported to World Health Organization from 32 countries or special regions with 916 related deaths reported (Fan et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Tsang et al., 2003, WHO, 2003). SARS is a system disease that impairs many organs, such as lung, liver and immune organs. Respiratory distress and decreased immune function are proposed to be the main causes of SARS patient death (Ding et al., 2003, Lang et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2003). Under the leading and coordination by the WHO, SARS was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus, which was designated as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The complete sequence of SARS-CoV genome was then determined by several research groups (Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, WHO, 2003). It was revealed that the genome of SARS-CoV contains 11 to 14 open reading frames (ORF), which encode replicase 1A, replicase 1B, four structure proteins (spike, S; envelope, E; membrane, M; nucleocapsid, N) and five to eight potential non-structural proteins (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Published data proposed that coronavirus accessory proteins, varying in size and position in the genome of coronaviruses, might be dispensable for virus replication, at least in the cell culture system, but may be important for virus\u2013host interaction (Haijema et al., 2004). For example, mutants or deletion of one of these proteins, such as 7b gene of feline coronavirus or gene 3 of swine enteric and respiratory coronavirus, have been reported to be related to the reduced virulence and pathogenesis (Herrewegh et al., 1995, Paul et al., 1997).",

            "text": "The ORF of SARS-CoV X2, named 3b by Thiel, encodes 154 amino acids (CDS: 25680-26144), overlapping entirely with ORF3a and E protein, and may be expressed from the ORF3 using an internal ribosomal entry site (Rota et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). Bioinformatics analysis showed that SARS-CoV 3b protein did not match any known sequences as well as 3b protein of other coronavirus members (Marra et al., 2003). The ORF3 in the known coronavirus has been demonstrated to be functionally bicistronic or tricistronic, which coded 3a, 3b and 3c (for E) protein (Le et al., 1994, Liu and Inglis, 1992). Published studies revealed that ORF3b was expressed in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) infected cells (Curtis et al., 2002, Liu et al., 1991, Shen et al., 2003). It was further reported that 3b protein of IBV was localized in the nucleus and took part in the pathogenesis and replication of IBV (Shen et al., 2003). Till now, there is no report on SARS-CoV 3b protein. In this study, we present data demonstrating that (i) 3b protein was capable of localizing to nucleus in the absence of any additional viral proteins, (ii) 3b protein was co-localized with nucleolus marker proteins C23/nucleolin, B23/nucleophosmin and fibrillarin in transfected cells, (iii) and the regions required for nucleolar localization were identified.",

NLS1, located at aa135\u2013138 (KHKK), comprises pattern 4 sequences, and bipartite NLS, located at aa137\u2013153 (KKVSTNLCTHSFRKKQV), overlaps with pattern 4 sequences.

To learn more function about it, the gene of 3b from SARS-CoV genome (ZJ01, AY297028) was cloned into pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 vectors and expressed in 293 cells (Fig. 1A).

Previous studies showed that some virus proteins, such as coronavirus nucleocapsid protein and HIV rev protein, were localized to the nucleolus through the association with C23, B23 or fibrillarin (Chen et al., 2002, Cheng et al., 2002, Dundr et al., 1995, Yoo et al., 2003). C23/nucleolin, B23/nucleophosmin and fibrillarin all are important nucleolar proteins which localize in nucleolus and involve in ribosomal assembly and biogenesis, rRNA transport and processing RNA transcripts. To confirm 3b's nucleolus localization, we performed co-localizing analysis of p3b-EGFP with C23, B23 and fibrillarin. Indirect immuno-fluorescence with a monoclonal antibody against C23 was first used to show the nucleolus. As shown in Fig. 2A, 3b-EGFP accumulated mainly in nucleoli in transfected COS-7 cells. Co-transfection of p3b-EGFP with pC23-DsRed, pB23-DsRed and pfibrillarin-DsRed were performed separately and further confirmed that 3b was predominantly localized in the nucleolus in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2B). Using 293 cells, similar results were obtained (data not shown). From the results above, it was deduced that there were nucleolar localization signals (NoLS) in protein 3b, which is able to target exogenous EGFP protein to the nucleolus.",

As shown in Fig. 3B, 3b D18-EGFP and D39-EGFP were predominantly localized in nucleolus and seemed to be more accumulation to the nucleolus than that of wild type 3b-EGFP. Further deletions of 3b from 45 to 124 aa (3b D45-EGFP, D68-EGFP, D80-EGFP and D124-EGFP) were all able to efficiently target the EGFP to the nucleolus, but the localization patterns (Fig. 3B) were altered from the characteristic bright fluorescence in nucleolus to some dotted distribution in cytoplasm. These results suggested that C-terminal region from 125 to 154 aa might contain functional NoLS.

A number of virus proteins have been shown to localize to nucleolus and dysregulated nucleolar functions for virus replication, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type I Rev and Tat (Strebel, 2003), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) Rex (Kubota et al., 1996), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 gamma (1) 34.5 protein (Cheng et al., 2002). The nucleolus is also the site of Borna disease virus replication and transcription (Pyper et al., 1998). Coronavirus was known to replicate and assembled in the cytoplasm. Using electron microscope, it was observed the virus-like particles in the nucleus of SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells at 48 h p.i., and their appearance was similar to that of the nucleocapsids in VMMV (Qinfen et al., 2004). This phenomenon has not been reported in known coronavirus studies. Also it needed to be determined with immune electron microscopy.",

Expression of the TGEV N protein could regulate cell cycle and induce cell cycle delay or arrest, implicating that nucleolus localization of N protein might interfere with host cell translation by disrupting the formation of new ribosome. Recently, it was reported that SARS-CoV N distributed predominantly in cytoplasm and was not found in nucleolus in SARS-CoV infected and transfected Vero-E6 cells (Chang et al., 2004). Interesting, in this article, we observed that SARS-CoV protein 3b was predominately localized to nucleolus in many transfected cells through its potential NoLS. These results inferred that SARS-CoV is different from previously known coronavirus not only in genome but also in the functions of some coronavirus proteins, and these differences may be favorable for the replication and assemblage of SARS-CoV in infected cells (Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004). Till now, the function of SARS-CoV protein 3b in nucleolus is unknown. Much work remains to be done in defining the expression of 3b in SARS-CoV infected cells and elucidating the potential function of 3b in the life cycle of SARS-CoV.",
