Loss of ACE2 leads to an age\u2010dependent cardiomyopathy [1, 2, 3] and kidney disease [4] while also enhancing pulmonary [5], cardiac [6] and renal injuries [7]. In addition to its peptidase action, ACE2 also functions as the receptor for the \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2019 coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) [8, 9, 10] and ACE2 expression is necessary for the pulmonary infection by SARS\u2010CoV [10, 11, 12]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly through the world leading to significant morbidity and acute, often lethal, lung failure with a mortality of approximately 10% despite modern\u2010day therapies [11, 12]. In Toronto, the SARS outbreak was associated with loss of lives, considerable burden on the healthcare system and a huge economic impact [13, 14, 15].",

Interestingly, patients infected with the SARS\u2010CoV suffered from cardiac disease including systolic and diastolic dysfunction [17], arrhythmias and sudden death [18]. We hypothesized that the interaction between SARS\u2010CoV and ACE2 in the heart could contribute to SARS\u2010mediated myocardial inflammation and damage. We showed that pulmonary infection with the SARS\u2010CoV in mice leads to myocardial SARS\u2010CoV in an ACE2\u2010dependent manner coupled with down\u2010regulation of the myocardial Ace2 mRNA and loss of ACE2 protein. In patients who died from SARS, presence of SARS\u2010CoV in the heart was associated with greater macrophage infiltration and myocardial damage in association with decreased myocardial ACE2 protein expression. Our results demonstrate that ACE2 plays a key role in mediating SARS\u2010CoV infection in the heart, which in combination with down\u2010regulation of the myocardial ACE2 could be the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of SARS\u2010associated heart disease.",

            "text": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is the functional receptor for the SARS\u2010CoV and mediates SARS\u2010CoV pulmonary infection [8, 10]. We examined the myocardial response to pulmonary infection with the SARS\u2010CoV. Within 2 days following SARS\u2010CoV infection, there was a marked presence of the SARS\u2010CoV in the heart of wild\u2010type (Ace2+/y) mice, while SARS\u2010CoV levels were reduced in the hearts of Ace2\u2212/y mice providing the first evidence for dependence of myocardial SARS\u2010CoV infection on ACE2 expression (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, this process lead to a partial down\u2010regulation of Ace2 mRNA expression in wild\u2010type mice (Fig. 1b) in association with a complete loss of myocardial ACE2 protein levels (Fig. 1c,d). These results show that in a well\u2010validated pulmonary murine model of SARS [10], SARS\u2010CoV can clearly infect the heart and modulate ACE2 expression. To decipher whether the effects on ACE2 expression is mediated directly by SARS\u2010CoV vs. a secondary myocarditis process, we studied the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus\u2010induced murine model of viral myocarditis. Consistent with the impact of SARS\u2010CoV on myocardial Ace2 mRNA expression, EMC viral myocarditis was associated with a significant decrease in Ace2 mRNA (Fig. 1e). In contrast, myocardial ACE2 protein levels showed a significant increase (Fig. 1f,g) suggesting an increased transcriptional efficiency of Ace2 mRNA and/or reduced proteolytic processing of ACE2. These results demonstrate that pulmonary infection with SARS\u2010CoV in our murine model leads to myocardial SARS\u2010CoV in an ACE2\u2010dependent manner in association with decreased myocardial Ace2 mRNA expression and a specific reduction in myocardial ACE2 protein levels.",

Given the high expression of ACE2 in the heart [1, 24] coupled with the observation that SARS\u2010CoV is detectable in the plasma of SARS patients [12, 25], we examined whether pulmonary SARS\u2010CoV infection leads to myocardial SARS\u2010CoV infection in patients who died from SARS. We examined the archived postmortem autopsy heart tissues from patients who had succumbed to the SARS crisis for the evidence of myocardial SARS\u2010CoV infection. Twenty patients, all of whom had confirmed diagnoses of SARS with SARS\u2010CoV being detected in their lungs, were studied. Reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that 35% of the patients (7 of 20) had positive SARS\u2010CoV genome detected in the heart (Fig. 2a) with an average viral load of 4\u00b707 \u00d7 106 copies of SARS\u2010CoV per gram of heart tissue (age: 70 \u00b1 12 years; 3M/4F). Importantly, the duration of the illness was significantly shortened in patients with detectable SARSCoV in their hearts (n = 7; 3\u00b79 \u00b1 2\u00b73 days) vs. patients without SARS\u2010CoV in the heart (n = 13; 43\u00b72 \u00b1 9\u00b77 days) (P < 0\u00b705) (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that in patients with SARS, pulmonary SARS\u2010CoV infection can clearly lead to SARS\u2010CoV infection in the heart resulting in a more aggressive illness and earlier death. Trichrome\u2010staining showed increased myocardial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in patients who had SARS\u2010CoV detected in their hearts (Fig. 2a\u2013e). The presence of myocardial inflammation and reduced ACE2 expression in response to myocardial SARS\u2010CoV infection was associated with pathological hypertrophy as shown by increased cardiomyocyte cross\u2010sectional area (Fig. 2f). Assessment of apoptosis using TUNEL staining revealed no increased apoptosis in the autopsied heart samples (Fig. 2g,h).",

The specificity of our anti\u2010ACE2 antibody was shown by pre\u2010incubation with human recombinant ACE2 (1 mg mL\u22121, kindly provided by Apeiron Biologics, Austria), which blocked most of the immunostaining for the native ACE2 protein (Fig. 4e).",

In this study, we have provided evidence that ACE2 functions as the myocardial SARS\u2010CoV receptor in vivo. Respiratory SARS\u2010CoV infection in our murine model leads to an ACE2\u2010dependent SARS\u2010CoV infection in the heart and decreased myocardial Ace2 mRNA expression. Cytokine\u2010mediated transcriptional down\u2010regulation of Ace2 mRNA could have lead to decreased Ace2 mRNA level in SARS\u2010CoV and EMC\u2010mediated viral myocarditis[26]. Virus\u2010mediated receptor down\u2010modulation has been described for multiple viruses including HIV, measles and pulmonary SARS\u2010CoV [10]. The complete loss of ACE2 protein in hearts infected with SARS\u2010CoV could be secondary to the activation of ADAM\u201017/TACE by the SARS spike protein, which is known to cleave and release ACE2 [27] and/or due to SARS\u2010CoV binding to ACE2 in the endothelial cells leading to endocytosis of the ligand/receptor complex [12, 28] and subsequent intracellular degradation of ACE2.",

We showed that patients who had SARS\u2010CoV in their hearts died considerably earlier suggesting that myocardial SARS\u2010CoV infection was associated with a more aggressive course of illness. SARS\u2010CoV interaction with ACE2 led to SARS\u2010associated cardiomyopathy and likely contributed significantly to the morbidity and mortality in patients with SARS [17, 18]. Consistent with the cardiac disease in patients who succumbed to SARS, we previously reported that bilateral pulmonary oedema in association with bilateral pleural effusions was frequently observed at the time of autopsy [22]. Increased myocardial interstitial fibrosis in patients with SARS\u2010CoV in the heart is consistent with recent findings showing that the SARS\u2010CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein potentiates transforming growth factor\u2010beta\u2010mediated fibrosis [29]. Consistent with observations in lung tissue from patients affected by SARS [23], CD 68 positive macrophages were detected in SARS\u2010positive hearts with an absence of lymphocytic invasion. In contrast to classic viral myocarditis as seen with the enteroviruses and herpesvirus type 6, which are associated with a prominent lymphocytic infiltration [30], SARS\u2010CoV\u2010induced myocardial inflammation is mediated predominantly by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines [23, 31].",

Myocardial dysfunction could also be secondary to the strong interferon\u2010mediated immunopathological events associated with the immune response in patients with SARS [31, 32]. The cardiovascular involvement could explain the marked age dependence of mortality seen in patients with SARS [11, 12] because of decreased cardiovascular reserve with ageing. Consistent with ACE2 being a key SARS\u2010CoV receptor, patients with diabetes mellitus in whom ACE2 expression is increased [7] showed greater susceptibility to SARS [13, 14]. Our results imply that interactions between infectious agents with key receptor/signalling pathways in the cardiovascular system may confer unique sensitivity to SARS\u2010CoV and potentially other viral infections. Indeed, interaction and subsequent activation of the PI3K signalling by influenza A virus are an important determinant of viral replication and may lead to adverse cardiovascular effects in the setting of an avian influenza epidemic [33].",
