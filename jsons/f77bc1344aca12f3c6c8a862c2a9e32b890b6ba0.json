However, these genetic polymorphisms are present in East Asians only ( Fig. 16.1b) . Therefore, such genetic risk factors do not play a role in the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Africa [13] . Age of infection may underlie the main mechanism for chronic persistent HBV infection in Africans as well as in other continents. The high prevalence of persistent HBV infection-related HLA-DP and -DQ loci in East Asians probably evolved during human migration. A trend of decreased immune-related gene expression was found for the period shortly after human migration out of Africa ( Fig. 16.1a) . Higher expression genotypes for IL-28B, interferon lambda 4, complement factor B, and CD40 are more prevalent in Africans than in either Europeans or South Asians [13] . In addition, when human Regions with higher plant and animal biodiversity often also feature an increased range and abundance of vector-or non-vector-borne diseases. Accordingly, the inhabitants of these areas should be able to handle an increased number of unfamiliar microorganisms. Those subjects who demonstrate direct and strong immune responses may die of cytokine storm in fulminant hepatitis, SARS, influenza, or other infections.

One explanation is that our innate immunity is continuously challenged by microorganisms and environmental substances. The strength of the innate immune response thus increases with age. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) is high in pre-term infants, progressively declines over the first year of life, and is lowest in adults [19] . In contrast, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) gradually increases with age. This age-associated change and other unclear cofactors may orchestrate an immune clearance reaction once a break point is reached.",
