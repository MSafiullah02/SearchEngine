This process in former USSR countries is regarded as a natural attribute of religious awakening. (Hoggarth, 2016) . The first and only bank which positioned itself as an institution following Islamic finance technologies, Badr Forte Bank, with a limited range of products, operated from 1996 to 2006. It was only in the 2010s when several Islamic finance projects were created in various Russian regions, some of which still exist, and their experience allows us to assess some results. Starting from 2014, when the western capital market was restricted for Russia, the Russian authorities along with some big banks and corporates, for the first time, set their sights on Islamic banking as an alternative. The developing relations, at a high political level, between Russia and the Gulf countries, opened new opportunities for economic cooperation, including the Islamic finance segment. Effective cooperation in investment with foreign companies and funds also depends on the development and maturity of the local Islamic finance market, including relevant business projects.",

The local sector, specifically, small and medium enterprises, are lacking financial resources to expand their businesses.

Starting in 2015, there was an increase in the number of papers devoted to Islamic finance in Russia. Web of Science database includes four papers addressing the topic of the Islamic finance market in Russia and its prospects (Chokaev, 2015; Hazzar et al., 2018; Ivanova et al., 2018; Malyaev, 2017) . Chokaev (2015) analyzes the main impediments for the development of Islamic finance institutions in Russia and specifies the potential economic benefit. Hazzar et al. (2018) address the Islamic banking regulation system, comparing the Shariah approach and Russian legislation, and suggesting a phased approach to creating a proper legal environment. The main focus of previous research the analysis of the legal environment and challenges to Islamic finance development (Hazzar et al, 2018; Chokaev, 2017) , the study of the prospects for the Islamic insurance market (Bekkin, 2007; Magomadova et al., 2018) , overview of certain Islamic finance transactions (Musaev and Magomedova, 2018) and agreements, particularly, ijarah (Ivanova et al., 2018) , along with the general significance of the Islamic finance industry for Russia (Zaripov, 2016; Yordanova, 2018; Malyaev, 2017) .

From among 8 banks that entered the Islamic finance market with their products, only two are still rendering Islamic finance services, in 2019 (Table 1 ). The main reason is not related to Islamic finance though. In 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the licenses and imposed a reorganization procedure over three of them, including Tatagroprombank, which initiated the \"Islamic window\", the subsidiary bank of Tatfondbank. The bank's Islamic finance project, Centre for Partnership Banking, was positioned as a pilot project of the Republic of Tatarstan, and its discontinuance was sadly received by the regional and expert community. The two other banks, Sovcombank and Express bank, put on hold Islamic finance pilot products at their discretion. (Sberbank, 2019c ). Sberbank's entry into the market, given its allocated financial portfolio, has led the market to its growth, twofold in 2018 (Diagram 5). The bank's first deal was a mudaraba-based transaction for a Tatarstan-based leasing company for the amount of 45 mln RUR / 705 480 USD. There are also some indications (Bekkin and Aliskerov, 2017 ) that certain Islamic finance services had been provided by the Moscow branch of Azerbaijani MBA-bank. However, due to the lack of data, this initiative is not included in the Table. Sberbank, the biggest Russian bank by assets, announced in 2019 that its Islamic finance portfolio had reached 16 billion RUR / 250 million USD. This sum included the ICR deal in Turkmenistan for 14 billion RUR / 219.5 million USD, in April 2019. The bank mainly concentrates on export trade finance, which accounts for about 98 % of its Islamic finance J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f operations. There is no open data, however, on the specifics of the bank's Islamic finance deals and its legal or Shariah structure. Sberbank is positioning itself not merely as a bank, but as a dynamically developing financial ecosystem. Its products are popular both among companies and retail customers. The bank provides limited information on its Islamic finance operations, targeting its potential audience mainly through specialized events and media. Sberbank's plan on Islamic finance has changed since the inception of the project. In 2017, Sberbank planned to create a special Islamic finance entity and propose regulatory changes (Vizcaino, 2017) . However, in two years, the plans did not come to fruition, although the bank's Islamic finance deals have been growing yearly. The bank positions its presence in the Islamic finance market in the following directions: 1) providing Sharia-compliant finance for the corporate sector based on project finance (mudaraba);",

TIIC was created with the participation of the Jeddah based Islamic Development Bank, the Government of Tatarstan and five financial institutions from the Gulf region. Zayed Fund was established by the UAE-based Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development (UAE), in 2017. To some extent, both funds were created as an exception from the rules. Normally, the IDB Group does not establish projects in non-member countries, and Khalifa Fund was initially created for operations only on the territory of the UAE. The results of the two are different. TIIC with its capital of 90 million J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f RUR 6 has only established the Eurasian Leasing Company in 2012 (Table 1 ) and could not expand its financing operations further, due to some internal policy limitations. As outlined by Yakupov, advisor to Tatarstan's prime minister for cooperation with Islamic financial institutions, among other factors that impeded the company's development, were challenges to projects' [legal] structuring and the financial crisis of 2008-2010. 7 Zayed Fund, at the time of its creation, got the undertaking from the investors for 50 mln USD to be directed to the Fund's programs. In 10 years time, the Fund plans to finance projects \"worth more than 300 mn USD\" (ZayedFund, 2019). The Fund operates only on the territory of the Chechen Republic, and in its financing activities, pursues policies to support human capital development: generating employment and promotion of entrepreneurship. According to the words of Mr. Nizar Cheniour, the fund doesn't invest in business, it \"invests in humans\" (MuslimEco, 2019a).",

From among approved projects which have not been launched yet, the share of Islamic finance is expected to be even higher (Arsaev, 2019). Such statistics are quite predictable: in Chechnya, the Islamic traditions are strong, and Shariah norms and principles are highly integrated into the daily life of people, including their way of doing business.

The first mortgage finance cooperative in the Islamic finance market was created in 2018, reflecting the general demand of the Russian population in home financing. The increase in demand is caused by the reforms related to construction co-funding in Russia. In 2018, amendments were introduced into Federal Law 214-FZ, on apartment block construction cofunding. Starting from July 1, 2019, all construction companies must use funding mechanisms based on escrow accounts (Diagram 3). This implies that funds cannot be taken from the clients and directed to construction needs. Instead, the funds must be reserved on the accounts, and bank credit should be used, which is against Shariah norms.

This makes the cost of murabaha financing higher compared to conventional finance: the banks are not subject to VAT. Moreover, the taxes should be paid at the moment when the murabaha agreement is signed (Table 4 ). This places a higher financial burden on Islamic finance companies, especially given the fact that there is no 100 % guarantee of payment in murabaha. Additionally, the taxation of the investors of Islamic finance companies is higher than that of bank depositors. 15 The unfriendly tax regime for murabaha is a burden for almost all market players. The taxation inequality for Islamic finance institutions in Russia is stated in numerous research (Chokaev, 2015; Aleshin and Radchenko, 2018; Hazzar et al., 2018) . The decision, as advised by some market participants, like Renat Yedikhanov, the CFO of Amal Finance House and member of the Russian Central Bank's working group on partnership banking, is to structure the deals closer to the commercial credit agreement. This agreement is not subject to VAT, according to the summary of the Russian Courts rulings, confirmed by the Ministry of Finance of Russia. However, not all market players are ready to use this opportunity to structure murabaha-based deals. Direct legal recognition of the murabaha deal is a preferred option, as it has been the case in other countries that introduced Islamic finance (Diagram 9).",

Seventy percent of the poll participants have a positive attitude towards such an undertaking (Diagram 11). Such an organization could be established by market participants with the aim of adopting internal standards related to Shariah governance, audit and ethics, to protect the market from disreputable players. AAOIFI standards could be the basis of such. In 2017, AAOIFI Shariah standards are officially published in Russia, and auditing and accounting standards are being translated. The potential CIPA examination centre creation in Russia, on the basis of Higher School of Economics, could positive developments in this regard (AAOIFI, 2019).

Although Russia has seen an interruption of the natural continuance of its religions traditions in 1917 -1990, the Russian Muslim community, in the recent decades, has succeeded in maintaining and developing expertise in fiqh muamalat al malia, based on the traditional Islamic schools of thought (mazhabs), the main centres of which are in Kazan (the capital of Tatarstan) and Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. This means that Islamic finance projects in Russia are not that dependent on the international expert community, unlike Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, which invited international Shariah experts to the Shariah boards of Islamic Banks. The Russian Shariah experts follow a stricter line in some matters than suggested in the AAOIFI Shariah standards. Juravliov (2013) , the researcher of Islamic finance and banking issues, outlines the fact that in Amal Finance House and LaRiba Finance company, there is a difference in their attitude to wakala in the context of murabaha. According to him, \"while this is a common practice in most markets elsewhere: actual purchase and subsequent delivery are performed by the institution itself without appointing the customer as the agent\". It should be noted that this is relevant not only for the two companies mentioned, but also for some other market players. A stricter approach is also implemented with regards to qabd (possession): the Shariah committees make sure that the institution acquires the assets physically through a personal inspection in as many cases as possible.",
