            "text": "Consistent with previous findings in COPD exacerbation,27, 28 isolation of new bacterial strain (class-switch) was associated with AEs (accounting for 20% of AEs), which warranted antibiotics treatment. However, the total bacterial load and microbiota taxa, analyzed by 16s rDNA sequencing, changed unremarkably before and after antibiotic treatment for AEs.13 Intriguingly, isolation of new bacterial strain (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae) was associated with increased risks of COPD exacerbations.28, 29, 30 Our study showed that isolation of new bacteria (mainly Haemophilus influenzae) was associated with AEs in bronchiectasis, implicating that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not the culprit of AEs and that antibiotic therapy targeting at the emerging bacterial species would be warranted. Hence, rapid microbiological assessments are important to clinical practice because they may help avoid over-treatment or under-treatment.",

The most prevalent viruses were influenza A/B, coronavirus and rhinovirus in our population, congruent with the findings from COPD patients in Hong Kong.31 Influenza A/B and rhinovirus, but not coronavirus, played crucial roles in AEs. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are unclear and warrant further investigations. Overall, our findings mirrored those reported in adults and children.11, 12 Compared with the study by Mitchell et al.,32 the difference in viral spectrum could have resulted from the differences in: (1) detection methods and assay kits; (2) the positive threshold of CT values; (3) the geographic regions.",

By contrast, bacterial plus viral isolations yielded greater lung function impairment and heightened inflammatory responses during COPD exacerbations.17, 18 This might be because bacterial plus viral isolations frequently comprised Pseudomonas aeruginosa and viral isolations in bronchiectasis as opposed to Haemophilus\ninfluenzae and viral isolations in COPD. Indeed, viral isolation may induce secondary bacterial isolation and further aggravated inflammation.33, 34 However, the load of Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not increase significantly regardless of viral isolation status or disease status (exacerbation vs. steady-state) in cystic fibrosis.35, 36 Moreover, respiratory syncytial virus isolation reportedly enhanced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm growth, rendering Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection more sustainable.37 Collectively, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation was unlikely the trigger of AEs despite co-existing viral isolations in bronchiectasis.",
