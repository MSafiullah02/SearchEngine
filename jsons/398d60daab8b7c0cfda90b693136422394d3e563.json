            "text": "The advances in understanding complex networks have generated increasing interest in dynamical processes occurring on them. Pattern formation in activator-inhibitor systems has been studied in networks, revealing differences from the classical continuous media. Here we study pattern formation in a new framework, namely multiplex networks. These are systems where activator and inhibitor species occupy separate nodes in different layers. Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.",

Such media are often described by reaction-diffusion systems and consist of elements obeying an activator-inhibitor dynamics with local coupling. In his pioneering paper [1] , Turing showed that a uniform steady state can be spontaneously destabilized, leading to a spontaneous formation of a periodic spatial pattern, when reacting species diffuse with different mobilities. It was later proposed by Gierer and Meinhardt [4] that an activator-inhibitor chemical reaction is a typical example achieving Turing's scenario. Turing instability is a classical mechanism of self-organization far from equilibrium, and plays an important role in biological morphogenesis. It has been extensively studied in biological [4] [5] [6] and chemical [7] systems, as well as real ecosystems [8, 9] .",

Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature [12] ; two typical examples are epidemics spreading over transportation systems [13] and ecological systems where distinct habitats communicate through dispersal connections [14] [15] [16] [17] . Theoretical studies of reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks have recently attracted much attention [12, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Othmer and Scriven [22, 23] developed the general mathematical framework to describe Turing instability in networks, and provided several examples of small regular lattices. Afterwards, Turing patterns were explored in small networks of chemical reactors [24, 25] . More recent work in this area includes detailed studies of Turing bifurcation and related hysteresis phenomena in large complex networks [26, 27] , and oscillatory Turing patterns in multi-species ecological networks [28] .",

Three pairs of nodes, the critical ones, denoted by stars, have degrees exceeding the instability threshold. Thus, a non-uniform pattern starts to grow from these nodes. The critical node denoted by the red star is the first to spontaneously leave the uniform state, as shown in figure 3b. Next, figures 3c,d show that the critical nodes denoted by the green and blue stars rapidly differentiate from the uniform state. Finally, triggered by these growing perturbations, all nodes leave the steady state to establish a non-uniform pattern (FIG. 3e) . simulations. Figure 4a shows the amplitude A of the observed patterns (see Methods section), averaged over different simulations. Each point of the diagram is the average of ten different implementations of G (v) with the same mean degree k (v) ; G (u) is fixed. We clearly see that the amplitude is zero; i.e., the uniform state is the only stable attractor of the system, for k (v) smaller than a critical threshold k (v) c .

Therefore, the purposeful design of nonequilibrium patterns should be possible by tuning the architecture of the multiplex structure. Recently, new algorithms for building multiplex networks with positive or negative degree correlations across the layers have been proposed [43] [44] [45] . Using these algorithms, we can design multiplex networks where the onset of instability is controlled by tuning the degrees k (v) and k (u) , and the source of instability can be located at any desired pair of nodes i (v) , i (u) .",
