Premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to a second wave of infections [3]. It is thus critical to maintain regulatory measures within healthcare infrastructures within the next months to assure patient and staff safety and limit the number of infections. This can only be achieved by preparing the roadmap to elective surgery resumption. Unfortunately, there is, to date, no specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities [4].",

Other comorbidities to consider include high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, lung diseases, cancer, liver and kidney diseases [9]. Patients with BMI above [10] 30 kg/m2 may also be considered at risk for severe forms of COVID-19. Finally, the socio-professional situation should be considered with probably a priority for active workers.

Patients with COVID-19 infection (suspected or confirmed: category 4, 5, 6) should have fully recovered and displayed an adequate immune response before considering surgery. ASA I (normal healthy patient) and II (patient with a mild systemic disease) should also have the priority.

The viral SARS Cov-2 concentration in articular, periarticular and bony tissues and fluids of infected patients is currently unknown. However, it is reasonable to assume that it is lower in musculoskeletal tissues than in respiratory or digestive tissues. Given these uncertainties, it is recommended to decrease those types of surgeries which generate a high amount of aerosol like electrocautery, working with oscillating saws as well as pulse lavage procedures [12]. In the absence of well-established scientific criteria, minimally invasive and arthroscopic may have the lowest infection risk and currently appear to be safer. They should be considered a priority if elective surgeries will be resumed. Surgical procedures followed by a hospital stay of no more than two to three days should be initially favored.

Within each of these phases, two scenarios should be considered through a careful preoperative screening of patients. Appropriate scheduling should be made according to the COVID status and patients with no sign of COVID-19 or who have recovered from the disease (categories 1, 2, 3) should be separated from patients with COVID-19 infection (suspected or confirmed: category 4, 5, 6).

The safety levels of gowns for medical use can be classified in levels 1\u20134 [20]. Level 1 gowns should be used in minimal risk environment such as basic care or for visitors. Level 2 gowns should be used in low risk procedures such as venous blood draw. Level 3 gowns are generally used for moderate risk procedures such as arterial blood draw, or in the ER.

There are three different types of disposable masks available. Single-use face masks, surgical masks, and respiratory masks. Single use face masks, which are typically thin and consisting of only one layer are only capable of filtering rather larger particles (3 \u03bcm). Surgical masks are generally more effective than single use face masks in filtering virus-sized particles. A medical or surgical mask may be sufficient to prevent droplet transfer but do not offer protection against high risk AGPs, while a respirator mask is required for airborne infection. Air purifying respirator masks should thus be used as they are generally filtering smaller sized particles (0.3 \u03bcm) than surgical masks. The European Standard (EN 149:2001) classifies respirator masks into three different categories: Filtering facepiece 1 (FFP1), FFP2, and FFP3. FFP2 is comparable to US standard N95 [21]. Respiratory AGP require FFP3 masks or powered air-purifying respirators, whereas surgical AGP only require FFP-2 masks. The fitting and sizing of the mask is of utmost importance. Only a perfect sized and well fitted mask leads to efficient sealing of the respiratory tract.",
