Hong Kong is the most severely affected city. WHO has referred to this unusual form of severe pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).1 The surveillance case definition of SARS is: history of high fever (>38\u00b7C); one or more respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing; and close contact within 10 days before onset of symptoms with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS, history of travel within 10 days before onset before symptoms to an area with reported foci of SARS transmission, or both.1 Household contact and contacts in health-care settings are believed to be important routes of transmission.2, 3 This transmission route could put children at particular risk, but most data available so far have been in adults. We therefore decided to report our experience in treating children with SARS.",

In addition, we treated patients who had moderate symptoms of high fluctuating fever and notable malaise with intravenous ribavirin (20 mg/kg daily, given in three doses) and hydrocortisone (2 mg/kg every 6 h) immediately after admission. For patients who had persistent fever and progressive worsening clinically or radiologically, we used pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (10\u201320 mg/kg).

Patient 2 had ill-defined patchy consolidation, but CT of the thorax showed multifocal air-space consolidation.

The typical radiographic changes in one patient are shown in the figure\n. Three of the five teenagers (patients 7\u20139) presented with bilateral lower-lobe opacification at presentation, which progressed rapidly within days. Despite clinical improvement, these consolidative changes persisted into the 2nd week of the illness. Patient 10 showed no abnormality on chest radiography at presentation, but high-resolution CT confirmed focal consolidation in the right lower lobe. In CT of the thorax in patients 2 and 6, the characteristic features of peripheral and alveolar opacities simulated the radiological appearances of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia. Four teenagers required supplemental oxygen, one required bi-level positive airway pressure and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation.

Coronavirus was isolated by viral culture from the nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients 2 and 3.

The clinical course was much milder and shorter among younger patients, and radiological changes were milder and generally resolved more quickly than in the teenagers. All paediatric patients had clinically important lymphopenia,3 but it was more severe among the teenage children.
