Its architecture and functions are more complex than previously assumed. In the classical RAAS, the protease renin, which is secreted from renal juxtaglomerular cells, acts on the circulating precursor angiotensinogen to generate angiotensin (Ang) I (Figure 1). Ang I is converted by the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE) to Ang II, the main effector substance of the RAAS, with potent vasoconstrictive, pro\u2010inflammatory, and pro\u2010fibrotic properties. Consequently, ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective in hypertension, heart failure, and progressive renal damage.",

Further complexity was introduced by the discovery of an ACE homologue, ACE2. This enzyme cleaves Ang I into Ang (1\u20139), which can be converted to Ang(1\u20137) by ACE (Figure 1). Furthermore, ACE2 degrades Ang II to Ang(1\u20137). It has therefore been suggested that ACE2 acts in a counter\u2010regulatory manner to ACE by shifting the balance between Ang II and Ang(1\u20137), thus acting as a functional clearance mechanism for Ang II.",

ACE2 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein orientated with the N\u2010terminus and the catalytic site facing the extracellular space (an ectoenzyme), where it can metabolize circulating peptides. The small C\u2010terminal, cytoplasmic domain has a number of potential regulatory sites. The similarity with ACE relates only to its topology and much of the extracellular domain (Figure 2); the juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of ACE2 share similarity with the renal, transmembrane protein collectrin 10 (Figure 2), which stimulates insulin exocytosis and pancreatic beta\u2010cell proliferation 11, 12.

ACE2 therefore has the ability to convert the decapeptide Ang I to Ang(1\u20139) and the octapeptide Ang II to Ang(1\u20137). A kinetic study evaluating the comparative roles of ACE and ACE2 in angiotensin metabolism 14 established that Ang II is hydrolysed two orders of magnitude more efficiently by ACE2 than Ang I. Hence, the major role of ACE2 in angiotensin metabolism seems to be the production of Ang(1\u20137), whose actions oppose those of Ang II. Different in vivo studies strongly support the concept that a major role of ACE2 is indeed the generation of Ang(1\u20137) from Ang II and that its conversion of Ang I to Ang(1\u20139) is not normally of physiological importance 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, except possibly under conditions that raise Ang II levels, eg ACEi or ARB treatment 21.",

However, binding of the SARS viral spike protein to ACE2 does trigger enzyme internalization, down\u2010regulating activity from the cell surface. In polarized cells, ACE2 is exclusively targeted to the apical surface 23, 24, in contrast to ACE which distributes equally between apical and basolateral surfaces 23. Another mechanism for down\u2010regulating ACE2 at the cell\u2010surface is by proteolytic shedding of its extracellular domain. This shedding, which is also undergone by ACE, is stimulated by phorbol esters and is blocked by inhibitors of the ADAMs family of zinc metalloproteinases. ADAM17 (TACE) is implicated as the primary enzyme involved in the regulated shedding of ACE2 25, resulting in detectable levels of ACE2 in plasma and urine 14, 23, 26.",

Specifically, there was a 40% decrease in fractional shortening with slight ventricular dilatation. Interestingly, there was thinning of the left ventricular (LV) wall rather than LV hypertrophy and/or cardiac fibrosis. These changes progressed with age and were more prominent in male mice 28. The hearts of these Ace2 KO mice showed increased Ang II levels and up\u2010regulation of hypoxia\u2010inducible genes. The authors suggest that cardiac function is modulated by the balance between ACE and ACE2, and that the increase in local cardiac Ang II was involved in these abnormalities. This is supported by the fact that the cardiac phenotype and increased Ang II levels were completely reversible by concomitant deletion of the ACE gene in Ace2 KO mice. It remains unclear, however, why, despite elevated Ang II levels, the hearts of these Ace2 KO mice did not show any cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. This may partly be related to Ang II\u2010independent effects of ACE2, such as effects of the other substrates described above 22, which also can influence cardiac contractility.",

TAC was associated, when compared with wild\u2010type mice subjected to the same procedure, with a marked increase in cardiac Ang II levels and increased fibrosis, LV dilation, and myofibrillar disarray.

Crackower et al\n28 were the first to test ACE2 as the gene underlying the blood pressure locus on the X chromosome. They showed reduced expression of renal ACE2 in the salt\u2010sensitive Sabra hypertensive rat compared with the normotensive rat. Both hypertensive SHR and SHRSP rats showed reduced renal ACE2 protein levels compared with the normotensive Sabra and WKY strains. Two other groups confirmed some of these findings by showing that SHR rats have lower renal ACE2 mRNA, protein, and activity compared with WKY rats 44, 45. However, others were unable to detect any differences in renal ACE2 mRNA, protein, and activity between adult hypertensive rats and their normotensive controls 46. On close scrutiny, in SHRSP rats the allele of the previously identified blood pressure locus on rat chromosome X contributes to a blood pressure\u2010lowering effect 42, while in the salt\u2010sensitive Sabra hypertensive rat this allele contributes to a blood pressure\u2010increasing effect 43, suggesting that it is not the same gene that underlies the blood pressure locus.

Moreover, Tikellis et al showed that in the kidneys of SHR rats ACE2 expression follows a developmental pattern with declining expression during development and onset of hypertension 45. In line with the beneficial effects of RAAS blockade on cardiac ACE2 as mentioned earlier, renal ACE2 activity is also increased in response to ACEi and ARB 59, 60. In contrast, further enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of ACEi resulted in an unexpected reduction in renal ACE2 expression compared with ACEi alone 61.
