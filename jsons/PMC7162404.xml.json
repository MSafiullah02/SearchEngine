The binding site for Ezetimib on CD13 differs from the aminopeptidase activity of this antigen (4). Since CD13 is constitutively expressed in lipid rafts of monocytes/macrophages, it is tempting to speculate that Ezetimib influences structure and/or function of rafts in these cells. Indeed, the present study provides evidence that Ezetimib modulates the cellular redistribution and expression of CD13 in monocyte\u2010derived macrophages. Moreover, the expression of further raft\u2010associated antigens such as the Fc\u03b3 receptors CD16 and CD64, and the scavenger receptor CD36, extensively implicated in cellular uptake of modified lipoproteins or phagocytosis, is also down\u2010regulated in response to Ezetimib. The decreased expression of these receptors upon Ezetimib administration may lead to an impaired macrophage\u2010differentiation and lipid\u2010uptake, and thus Ezetimib quite likely exerts an in vitro antiatherogenic effect in monocyte\u2010derived macrophages, which involves rafts.",

Ezetimib may exert its cellular effect through disruption of the coassembly of CD13 with CD64/CD16 or CD36, and in this scenario, the missing coassociation of receptors may lead to their disappearance from rafts. The finding that CD13 disappears from DRMs/rafts in response to Ezetimib (Fig. 1C) may support this hypothesis. Binding of Ezetimib to CD13 quite likely induces a conformational change in the extracellular domain of CD13, masking the specific sequence required for coassociation of CD13 with other receptors. Such a mechanism has recently been proposed for Ezetimib in enterocytes (4). Alternatively, shedding of CD13 in response to Ezetimib may also explain the loss of its expression.",
