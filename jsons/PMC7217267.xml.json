A total of 1,202,715 people have been infected and 64,734 people have been killed by the novel coronavirus.[1] As such tremendous research is underway to find prevention or cure. Recently, there has been considerable interest on whether Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine provides any immunity to COVID-19.[2] We sought to study whether there is in fact any significance to the claim that BCG provides immunity to COVID-19. Furthermore, it must be remembered that BCG is in fact a strain of Mycobacterium species (live-attenuated strain obtained from Mycobacterium bovis). Hence, we also tried to study that whether it is specifically BCG that is providing the immunity, or is it the Mycobacteria species (for example, latent or subclinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis), in general, that is providing the protection against COVID-19?",
