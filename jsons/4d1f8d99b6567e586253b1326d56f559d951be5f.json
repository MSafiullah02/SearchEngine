[1] [2] [3] So far, Xenopus laevis XendoU, as well as its human homologue placental protein 11 (PP11), and viral homologue NendoU, have been characterized as endoribonucleases participating in RNA-processing events. They are uridylate-specific, Mn 2 + -dependent enzymes that produce molecules with 2',3'-cyclic-phosphate termini, a unique characteristic of this particular class of RNases. In addition, phylogenetic and structural studies indicated that one of the most conserved regions shared by the three proteins includes the putative active site, which displays a common architecture that may be involved in different RNA processing pathways. [1] The other members of the family are annotated as putative serine proteases; nevertheless, the high evolutionary conservation with the characterized RNases suggests that they may have endoriboucleolytic activity as well.",

[3] [4] [5] The second member to be described was a viral homologue called NendoU, [6, 7] a major genetic marker of nidoviruses, which include the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [2] NendoU is crucial for the viability of the viruses; mutation of a single residue within its putative active site abolishes viral RNA synthesis. [6] Recently, the human homologue PP11 was characterized, [8] and despite its annotated function as a putative serine pro-tease, [9] it has an endoribonuclease activity with placental tissue specificity. [8] In addition, PP11 is expressed in different tumors such as cysto-adenocarcinomas, breast cancers, testicular and gastric cancers; its dysregulated expression in tumor tissues suggests that it may be associated with carcinogenesis. [10] Due to their involvement in human pathologies, these enzymes represent potential targets for the development of therapeutic agents.",

The members characterized so far are endoribonucleases sharing similar biochemical properties and a common architecture in their active sites. Despite their similarities, these proteins are involved in distinct RNAprocessing pathways in different organisms. The amphibian XendoU participates in the biosynthesis of small nucleolar RNAs, the human PP11 is supposed to play specialized roles in placental tissue, and NendoU has critical function in coronavirus replication. Notably, XendoU family members have been implicated in human pathologies such as cancer and respiratory diseases: PP11 is aberrantly expressed in various tumors, while NendoU activity has been associated with respiratory in-fections by pathogenic coronaviruses. The present study is aimed at identifying small molecules that may selectively interfere with these enzymatic activities. Combining structurebased virtual screening and experimental approaches, we identified four molecules that specifically inhibited the catalytic activity of XendoU and PP11 in the low micromolar range. Moreover, docking experiments strongly suggested that these compounds might also bind to the active site of NendoU, thus impairing the catalytic activity essential for the coronavirus life cycle. The identified compounds, while allowing deep investigation of the molecular functions of this enzyme family, may also represent leads for the development of new therapeutic tools. to be used for structure-based drug design (i.e., virtual screening); 2) the recombinant protein displays the same enzymatic features as the native enzyme; [4] 3) in vitro functional tests, distinguishing between the enzyme binding and catalytic activities, are already available.

            "text": "The XendoU crystal structure revealed the presence of a phosphate bound between the a7 helix and the b-sheet III, the site crucial for catalytic activity. [1] In a tentative approach to validate the correspondence between the phosphate location and the potential catalytic site, blind docking simulations were conducted using AutoDock, as previously reported for the PP11 protein. [8] In the present docking experiments, uridine 3'monophosphate (3'-UMP), uridine 2',3'-cyclophosphate (2',3'cyclic-UMP), uracil dimer (UU), uracil trimer (UUU), and the tetramer CUUG were used in turn as substrates/ligands. Interestingly, the most favorable bound conformations predicted (i.e., the lowest energy enzyme-ligand complexes) all included the ligand docked in the proximity of the phosphate binding site (Figure 1 ). In particular, the predicted positions of the phosphates in 3'-UMP and 2',3'-cyclic-UMP overlap quite well with the experimentally determined bound phosphate (Supporting Information figure S1 a-b), although the pyrimidine moiety is differently orientated. This discrepancy between predicted and experimental binding modes is probably due to the limitations of AutoDock in treating cycles as flexible. In fact, in the docking studies, 2',3'-cyclic-UMP is conformationally constrained, and the program is unable to find alternative binding modes comparable with those of the other substrates/ligands ( Figure 1 ). However, forcing the 2',3'-cyclic-UMP to adopt a similar binding mode to 3'-UMP would result in a high energy complex (data not shown). Notably, the predicted bound conformations of UU, UUU and CUUG confirm the position of the active site region between the a7 helix and the b-sheet III and may explain the reported cleavage activity in the middle of a UU pair (Supporting Information figure S1 c-e). [4] Multidocking virtual screening for the identification of potential XendoU ligands Virtual screening, a ligand-knowledge driven approach, is now a widespread lead identification method in the pharmaceutical industry. [11, 12] The best results are normally obtained by combining different virtual screening methods, using information about the drug targets as well as known ligands. Unfortunately, no information regarding known ligands was available in the present study; therefore, a multidocking approach was used (consensus docking). This method was applied to a database of 1990 compounds listed in the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) diversity set, a library that is representative of a larger collection of approximately 140 000 chemicals. Among the available docking programs, [13] attention was focused on free academic programs and, from among them, AutoDock, [14] DOCK, [15] SURFLEX [16] and OMEGA/FRED [17] were selected on the basis of both different implemented docking algorithms and successful validations. [18] Unlike the protocol reported by Miteva et al., [18] the consensus docking protocol used here (see Experimental Section for details) was conducted using the four docking methods in parallel, and a consensus score was applied to rank the overall obtained poses (Supporting Information figure S2 ).",

These compounds were experimentally tested for their biological activity using an in vitro cleavage assay. [5] A typical assay was carried out by incubating the enzyme with its RNA substrate in the presence of manganese, and by analyzing the products of cleavage at different times during the incubation. [5] For this reaction, the U16 snoRNA primary transcript (003 RNA), mimicking the natural XendoU substrate, was used. [19] As a source of enzymatic activity, we used a recombinant version of XendoU, the N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged XendoU (His-XendoU), which displays the same biochemical features as the native enzyme. [5] The cleavage assay was carried out in 10 % DMSO, a concentration that allowed compound solubility without affecting XendoU cleavage activity (data not shown). Figure 2 a shows the cleavage reactions carried out in the presence of the seven best perform- Notably, NSC 26699 (2), NSC 106505 (4), NSC 117199 (6) and NSC 130796 (7) inhibited the activity at lower concentrations (100 mm for 2; 50 mm for 6 and 7; 30 mm for 4; Figure 2 a and Table 1 ). The same analysis, performed on a shorter RNA substrate (21-nucleotide-long oligoribonucleotide P1) that contains two XendoU cleavage sites, [4] confirmed the inhibitory effect of compounds 1-7 and indicated that such activity does not depend on the length of the RNA substrate (Supporting Information figure S3 ). In addition, to exclude the possibility that these compounds interact nonspecifically with the His-tag of the recombinant protein, an RNA-processing assay was carried out in X. laevis oocyte nuclear extract (ONE) containing XendoU native enzyme. [4] The results obtained with one of the most active compounds, NSC 130796 (7), confirmed that the inhibitory activity is independent of the presence of the His-tag (Supporting Information figure S4) .",

The binding modes predicted by the four docking programs used in the virtual screening protocol were in good agreement with one another (Figure 3 ). It is noteworthy that a lower half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value correlates to improved agreement between the four predicted bind- ing conformations for each hit compound. In fact, increasing conformational disorder is associated with decreased inhibitory activity. This is in agreement with the observation that tighter interactions are predicted between the enzyme and inhibitor for NSC 106505 (4), NSC 117199 (6) and NSC 130796 (7), whereas the weakest interactions are predicted to be formed by the least active compound, NSC 13728 (1). Subsequent energy calculations indicated that the docked conformations proposed by AutoDock display the lowest energies, and consequently, we used this program for further analysis. Ligplot [20] diagrams of the AutoDock poses for inhibitors 1-7 show an extended network of predicted interactions for the most active molecules (4, 6 and 7); this network is reduced with the other inhibitors, with NSC 13728 (1; least active agent) predicted to have the least number of interactions (Supporting Information figure S6) . A three-dimensional analysis of the AutoDock predicted binding modes led to the definition of specific areas that are associated with the inhibitory activity of compounds 1-7 (Supporting Information figure S7 ). The extended hydrophobic ligand-receptor interactions (purple areas in Supporting Information figure S8 ) in the less active compounds seem to compensate for the lack of strong interactions (compare lig-plot diagrams in Supporting Information figure S6 ). Such an interaction profile allowed us to define ligand surfaces that are important for XendoU inhibition. In particular, the analysis of each molecular feature for all the identified hits led to the definition of a pharmacophore model made by six points that describe the minimal chemical characteristics required for XendoU inhibition (Figure 4) ; four of them, namely HY-1, HY-2, HA-1 and HA-2, are derived from the most active inhibitors and two of them, HY-3 and HY-4, are related to the less potent compounds.",

            "text": "Endoribonucleases are considered key players in all general processes associated with eukaryotic RNA metabolism in various subcellular compartments, where they are involved both in degradation pathways, such as RNA turnover, and in maturation pathways, producing functional RNA molecules. [22] XendoU is an endoribonuclease we discovered and purified from X. laevis oocyte. [4] Characterization of its activity indicated that, in X. laevis germ cells, it is responsible for the release of the intron-encoded U16 and U86 snoRNAs from their primary transcripts. These small noncoding RNAs are required for rRNA modifications that are, in turn, essential for ribosome biogenesis and function. However, whether XendoU plays different or additional functions in somatic cells is still unexplored. Subsequent production of recombinant XendoU protein allowed us to further characterize its activity by pursuing biochemical and structural studies. The three-dimensional structure of XendoU was solved, and the description of its active site, compared with those of other RNA processing enzymes, indicated that it displays a unique fold. [1] XendoU has been proposed as the founding member of a previously unidentified protein family. [2, 5] Phylogenetic analyses highlighted that XendoU is conserved among higher eukaryotes, with homologues from nidoviruses and a cyanobacterium also. [1] Despite the high conservation of the active site architecture, the endoribonucleolytic function has been proved for only three members of the family, whereas the other members, annotated as putative serine proteases, are still uncharacterized. The human and viral enzymes have been linked to human pathologies, such as tumors and respiratory diseases; therefore, the identification of small molecules that specifically interfere with such activities may represent the first step toward the development of novel therapeutic treatments.",

We reasoned that the main characteristic of such molecules should be their ability to locate inside the conserved active site. [1, 8] A preliminary docking simulation using AutoDock was applied to XendoU using various known substrates. This method confirmed the location of the XendoU active site in the region between the a7 helix and the b-sheet III that we previously determined through biochemical and crystallographic approaches. [1, 5] In a second step, virtual screening was achieved by a multidocking approach derived from the combination of AutoDock with other docking methods. Such an approach, applied to the NCI diversity set, led to the selection, from over 1990 molecules, of 40 compounds displaying potential inhibitory features. These molecules were experimentally tested on both X. laevis and human recombinant enzymes. Only four inhibitors effectively impaired the catalytic activity of both endoribonucleases, while not affecting the enzyme-substrate interaction. These results, while supporting our previous conclusion that the XendoU RNA binding and The sequence of P1 oligoribonucleotide, as well as the PP11 cleavage sites (indicated by arrows), are reported below. b) Dose-dependent inhibition assay of the four PP11 inhibitors. c) Binding assay: the four compound (1, 3, 4 and 7) that inhibit PP11 cleavage activity were further tested for their ability to affect PP11 binding properties. A mobility shift assay was performed as already described for XendoU. His-PP11 was incubated with a fixed amount of 32 P-labeled RNA alone (lanes 3 and 4) or in the presence of each compound at a concentration of 200 mm (lanes 5-8). Untreated RNA was fractionated in lanes 1 and 2.

Together, this information gives six different XendoU conformations. Due to steric hindrance that is generated upon hydrogen atom addition, the six XendoU structures where geometrically optimized using the AMBER 8 molecular modeling suite. To this aim, the structures were solvated (SOLVATEOCT command) in a box extending 10 with~8000 water molecules (TIP3 model) and neutralized with Na + ions. The solvated complexes were then refined by minimization (5000 interactions) using the SANDER module of AMBER. Graphical inspection of the minimized models and images were produced using the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Chimera package (version 1.5.2) from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at UCSF (supported by the US National Institutes of Health, grant: P41 RR001081). [23] The atom charges assigned on the protein by the leap modules were maintained for the subsequent docking simulations. The same protocol was used for NendoU, while the structure of PP11 was prepared as described earlier.
