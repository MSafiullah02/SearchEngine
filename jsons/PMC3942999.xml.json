            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious, life-threatening disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003). In 2003, SARS spread quickly in over 25 countries and caused 8098 probable SARS cases and 774 SARS-related deaths. Although various candidate drugs have subsequently been reported to attenuate the disease (Cinatl et al., 2005; Hoever et al., 2005; Holmes, 2003), there are currently still no clinically approved or recommended antiviral drugs specific for SARS use. Currently, the most frequent treatment for SARS is antiviral and supportive treatment using a combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids (Peiris et al., 2003; So et al., 2003). However, ribavirin is only marginally effective against the SARS virus, and shows serious adverse side effects (Cinatl et al., 2003; Stroher et al., 2004). Since the SARS outbreak, considerable effort has been put into antiviral research to evaluate drug candidates for anti-SARS-CoV activity to prevent possible re-emergence of the disease (Wen et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2004). Notably, glycyrrhizin from licorice roots and a number of glycyrrhizin derivatives have been shown to possess demonstrable anti-SARS-CoV bioactivities (Hoever et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2004). And the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, was also found to confer potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (Amici et al., 2006). A number of traditional herbal medicines have also been reported to possess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 2008; Li et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2005; Ryu et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV genome encodes various key protein molecules that may serve as potential targets for chemotherapeutic inhibition of viral infection and replication (Lai, 2005; Stadler et al., 2003). These vital targets include: the spike protein (S), the SARS-CoV main protease (3CL protease), the NTPase/helicase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the membrane protein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and possibly other viral protein-mediated processes (De Clercq, 2004; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Groneberg et al., 2005; Holmes, 2003; Kliger et al., 2005; Lai, 2005; Stadler et al., 2003). Anti-SARS-CoV agents that can inhibit SARS-CoV replication may be involved in inhibition of one or more of the above protein targets including SARS-CoV 3CL protease. This important protease regulates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides into functional proteins, playing an essential role in viral replication (Chen et al., 2002; Kuo et al., 2004). SARS-CoV 3CL protease is thus an attractive target for drug candidates against SARS.",

As seen in Table 2 and Figure 3B, the cytotoxic concentrations of individual extracts that reduced the cell viability to 50% of the untreated control (CC50) were calculated and compared with each other. The CC50 values for all test extracts were detected to be higher than 500 \u03bcg/ml; interestingly, however, the positive control valinomycin had in fact a relatively low CC50 value (75.01 \u03bcg/ml). This result suggests that these extracts had little or no interference with the growth of Vero E6 cells, and they can be considered as generally biologically safe to the host cells. According to the results in Table 2, we hence suggest that it is quite unlikely that the inhibitory effects detected for the tested herbal extracts on viral replication of SARS-CoV were due to the inhibitory effect on cell growth or viability of host cells. In addition, the selective index (SI), the ratio of CC50 to EC50, was also then calculated to evaluate the potency of anti-SARS-CoV activity of test extracts (Table 2). The SI values of CBE, CBM, GSH, DBM, CTH and TCH were determined at the value of > 59.4, not calculable, > 57.5, > 62.1, > 59.4, and > 92.9, respectively.

The IC50 values of extracts were measured using a quenched fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) method as previously described (Kuo et al., 2004).

To assure adequate public safety and control of infection in the event of a re-emergence of this illness, effective anti-SARS-CoV agents may still be highly desirable or even necessary. Plant materials, especially for those that were previously used in traditional Chinese medicines, we believe are rich resources for development of the related therapeutic agents or drug candidates. In this study, we have employed a cell-based cytopathogenic effect (CPE) assay in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells for screening more than 200 extracts for candidate anti-SARS-CoV activity. Six herbal extracts from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs were found to exhibit significant levels (+ to +++) of anti-SARS-CoV activity at concentrations of 25 and 100 \u03bcg/ml (Table 1). As measured and compared by results from the CPE assays, this level of anti-SARS-CoV activity is better than that reported for glycyrrhizin (Cinatl et al., 2003), a compound with known anti-SARS-CoV activity, and extracts of other traditional herbs previously reported to confer anti-SARS-CoV activity (Lau et al., 2008; Li et al., 2005).",

By quantification of the amount of spike protein present in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (EC50), we showed that the anti-SARS-CoV activity of these extracts may act specifically on the inhibition of viral replication (Table 2 and Figure 3A). In addition, a MTT assay was adopted to determine the CC50 of test extracts, and our data led us to suggest that the anti-viral activities we detected were apparently not due to the effects of cytotoxicity of test extracts on the host cells, as evidenced by the low EC50 of the extracts. The selective index (SI) value was calculated as the ratio of CC50 to EC50 as an indicator of the potency of test phytoextracts. In comparison to the positive control, valinomycin (VAL) (Wu et al., 2004), CBE, GSH, DBM, CTH and TCH showed potent activities against CPE, and they also exhibited marked inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV replication. The SI values (Table 2) for these five bioactive extracts are significantly higher even than the SI value of the positive control valinomycin (SI = 41.4). The SI values (all > 55) of these five extracts are also higher than two other traditional Chinese herbs previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV infection; Cinnamomi cortex was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV infection at a SI value of 23.4, and Toona sinensis extract was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication with an SI value of (12 to 17) (Chen et al., 2008). Taken together, we hence suggest that the six TCM phytoextracts reported here can inhibit SARS-CoV replication with little or no cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells, and are may thus serve as useful candidates for future development of anti-SARS therapeutics.",

Because of its pivotal role in the SARS-CoV life cycle, the 3CL protease is recognized as an important target for discovery of anti-SARS-CoV agents. Among the extracts tested for inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL protease activity, the IC50 values of CBM (39 \u03bcg/ml) and DBM (44 \u03bcg/ml) suggest that these two extracts can exhibit significant inhibitory activity against 3CL protease. A number of studies have contributed to the identification of inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease [15, 28-29]. However, the IC50 values of CBM and DBM for inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL protease are also similar or higher than extracts from other anti-SARS-CoV medicinal herbs reported to date, including Isatis indigotica (IC50 = 53.8 \u03bcg/ml) (Li et al., 2005), Torreya nucifera (IC50 = 100 \u03bcg/ml), tea extract (IC50 = 125 \u03bcg/ml) (Chen et al., 2005) and Houttuynia cordata (IC50 = 1000 \u03bcg/ml) (Lau et al., 2008). We therefore suggest that the herbal extracts of CBM and DBM may be useful drug candidates against SARS-CoV 3CL protease and may have potential for use as alternative herbal therapies against SARS. The other four herbal extracts we tested other than these two herbal extracts may inhibit SARS-CoV replication via different working mechanisms including blocking of viral binding, inhibition of SARS-CoV fusion with the host cells, inhibition on activity of other SARS-CoV proteases and inhibition of RNA transcription (Kliger et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Recently, phytochemicals or extracts derived from traditionally used medicinal plants or herbs have been contemplated or clinically evaluated as alternative or complementary treatments for various diseases. Previous reports showed that Cibotium barometz inhibited osteoclast formation and has antioxidative, tyrosinase inhibiting and antibacterial activities (Cuong et al., 2009; Lai et al., 2009). In this study, Cibotium barometz was found to possess good anti-SAR-CoV activity and effectively inhibit SARS 3CL protease activity. The bioactive components responsible for these activities should therefore warrant further investigations. Gentiana scabra has previously been shown to confer a hepatoprotective effect (Jiang and Xue, 2005) and contains triterpenoids of secoiridoid and its glycosides (Chueh et al., 2001; Kakuda et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2009). Based on our previous study on anti-SARS-CoV phytocompounds (Wen et al., 2007), specific triterpenoids have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication. We therefore suggest here that secoiridoid and its glycosides may contribute to the anti-SARS activity detected for Gentiana scabra extract, and secoiridoid and its glycosiedes may have potential for further evaluation as anti-SARS lead compounds. In our previous study (Su et al., 2011; Su et al., 2008), two specific polysaccharide-containing fractions from Dioscorea batatas tuber extracts significantly increased GM-CSF promoter activity in normal and inflamed skin, enhanced murine splenocyte proliferation ex vivo and improved regeneration of bone marrow cells in vivo. Other studies also revealed that the ethanolic extract from Dioscorea batatas can exert anti-inflammatory effect through the inhibition of NF-\u03baB-mediated iNOS and COX-2 expressions (Jin et al., 2010). Interference of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression may be correlated with anti-SARS-CoV and other antiviral activities (Amici et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010). We therefore hypothesize that the anti-SARS-CoV activities we demonstrated here may result from inhibition of COX-2 activity. Cassia tora has been found to confer anti-hypertensive (Hyun et al., 2009), anti-hyperlipidemia (Cho et al., 2007), anti-bacterial (Hatano et al., 1999), and anti-fungal properties (Kim et al., 2004). Anthraquinones including emodin, physcion, and rhein may be the active phytocompounds that confer these activities (Kim et al., 2004; Wu and Yen, 2004). Because emodin has already been found to exhibit anti-SARS-CoV activity via inhibition of the viral entry by binding with the spike proteins and interfering with the SARS-CoV 3CL protease activity, we hypothesize that the active phytochemical components responsible for anti-SARS-CoV activity of CTH may be contributed by emodin or another anthraquinone(s) suggested or known to present in CTH. Taxillus chinensis was shown to inhibit fatty acid synthase (Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006). Based on the previous study (Yi et al., 2004), which showed luteolin and quercetin can interfere with the entry of the virus to its host cells, we therefore hypothesize that specific glycosylated flavonoid and quercetin may play an effective role in this activity. Whether these flavonoids can also contribute to the detected anti-SARS activity warrants future investigation.",
