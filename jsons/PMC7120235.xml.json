            "text": "The influenza A virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae represents one of the best studied viruses. Influenza A virus particles contain a genome of eight RNA segments with negative polarity (Palese and Shaw 2007). The three largest segments 1, 2, and 3 encode the polypeptides PB2, PB1, and PA, respectively, which constitute the viral RNA\u2013dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) responsible for genome replication and mRNA transcription (Fig. 6.1). The RdRP is not only an RNA polymerase but is also responsible for polyadenylation of viral mRNA and the endonucleolytic generation of the transcription primers mentioned above. Initially, the endonuclease was thought to reside in PB2 (Shi et al. 1995), but recent results provided evidence for PA harboring the enzymatic domain (Dias et al. 2009; Yuan et al. 2009).\n",

            "text": "PA, a polypeptide of more than 700 amino acids, was expressed in insect cells in soluble form. Trypsin cleaves PA into N- and C-terminal domains of 25 and 55 kDa, respectively. The function of the latter is still unclear except for the fact that it mediates contacts with PB1 via a small C-terminal region (Ruigrok et al. 2010). The N-terminal ca. 250 amino acids of PA (PA-Nter) harbor the endonuclease activity of the influenza virus polymerase complex (Dias et al. 2009; Yuan et al. 2009). This fragment has been expressed in E. coli and subsequently crystallized. The overall structure shows an \u03b1/\u03b2 architecture with a core of five mixed \u03b2 strands forming a twisted plane surrounded by seven \u03b1-helices. Structure similarity searches gave no indications for entries with highly similar folds in the databases (Dias et al. 2009). The most similar structure identified in these searches was that of an archaeal Holliday junction resolvase (Hjc), obvious from superposition of helix \u03b13 and strands \u03b21\u2013\u03b25 encompassing a structural motif typically found in different nucleases including resolvases and type II restriction endonucleases (Knizewski et al. 2007; Kosinski et al. 2005). The motif conserved between Hjc and PA-Nter includes two acidic residues (Asp-108 and Glu-119 in the latter) that are known to be important for metal ion binding in the former enzyme. Residues Asp-108 and Glu-119 together with His-41 and Lys-134 of PA-Nter also align with catalytically important residues in the restriction endonuclease EcoRV (Glu -5, Asp-74, Asp-90 and Lys-92). Moreover, His-41, Asp-108, Glu-119, and Lys-134 together with Glu-80, a third acidic residue in the active site, are conserved among influenza viruses.",

Yuan and coworkers mutated the residues H-41, E-80, L-106, P-107, D-108, and E-119 proposed to be important for metal ion coordination (Fig. 6.1) (Yuan et al. 2009). In addition, K-134 was also included in these experiments because this residue is located close to the proposed active site of the endonuclease, and exchanges at this position had been shown before to specifically block transcription but not replication of the viral RNA (Hara et al. 2006). Polymerases with mutations E80A, D108A, E119A, and K134A retained significant genome replication efficiency, but were severely hampered in mRNA synthesis. The abrogation of transcription activity was indeed a consequence of blocked endonucleolytic activity of the polymerase since the mutants were able to perform transcription in the presence of ApG as a substitute for the cap-primer or after addition of a capped primer itself. In contrast, the L106A and P107A mutants retained some transcription activity but lost the ability to perform genome replication, while the H41A mutant was unable to perform RNA synthesis in general. The latter effects could not be circumvented in ApG-primed transcription assays. Finally, a direct endonuclease cleavage assay proved that all three exchanges affecting the acidic residues and the K134A mutation blocked the endonucleolytic activity (Yuan et al. 2009).",

Special features of the PA-Nter with regard to the other family members are the close vicinity of the two acidic residues in the conserved motif, an unusual position of the presumably catalytically important lysine (Lys-134), the histidine residue in the active site and the fact that RNA is the substrate instead of DNA.",

The structural data do not provide any evidence how the substrate specificity for a 5\u2032 capped RNA could be achieved. Experimental evidence has been provided for PB2 representing the cap-binding domain of the polymerase (Guilligay et al. 2008). A structure of the PB2 residues 320\u2013483 crystallized with m7GTP allowed identification of the residues responsible for binding the methylated guanine which are absolutely conserved among influenza A viruses. These residues include His-357 and Phe-404, which sandwich between their ring systems the purine of the methylated base, and Glu-361 and Lys-376 that specifically recognize the guanine base (Fig. 6.1). The mode of cap binding is very similar to what has been described for the nuclear cap-binding complex and the cap-binding translation initiation factor eIF4E found in the cytoplasm (Guilligay et al. 2008; Fechter et al. 2003; Li et al. 2001).",

The requirement for a 5\u2032 cap is a consequence of the mechanisms underlying translation initiation in eukaryotes (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch 2009). The cap structure represents the key element by which the translation system recognizes an mRNA to be translated. A so-called cap-binding complex assembles at the 5\u2032 terminal cap structure in the initial phase of the translation initiation process. Thus, an RNA without a cap structure is usually not accepted as a substrate for translation.\n",

It contains six motifs (preA, A-E) typical for RdRp in negative-strand RNA viruses, but specific functions could not be assigned to individual domains of the protein because of a lack of conserved sequence motifs (Schmaljohn and Nichol 2007). The endonucleolytic RNase activity crucial for cap snatching in bunyaviruses resides in the N-terminal ca. 180 amino acids of the L-protein (Reguera et al. 2010). The bunyavirus endonuclease has a very similar \u03b1-\u03b2 topology as PA-Nter of influenza A virus even though the lengths of the helices are significantly different. This similarity is especially striking in the core structure with the active site even though there is basically no homology between the two amino acid sequences. A core region of 55 residues contains the motif characteristic for the PD-(D/E)xK family of endonucleases. Within this region, a one-to-one mapping between the ligands coordinating the two metal ions was found (Reguera et al. 2010). For site 1, His-34, Asp-79, Asp-92, and the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-93 in the bunyavirus LaCross virus correspond to His-41, Asp-108, Glu-119, and Ile-120 in PA-Nter. For site 2, Asp-52 and Asp-79 in the bunyavirus sequence correspond to Glu-80 and Asp-108 in influenza virus PA N-ter. This high degree of similarity should reflect functional equivalence, and indeed the bunyavirus endonuclease can be blocked by the same inhibitor, 2, 4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (DBPA), as the influenza A virus enzyme. Important differences between the two structures concern the substrate-binding pocket. In PA-Nter, helix 2 together with the following loop are found in a position enabling them to restrict substrate access to the active site, whereas in the bunyavirus enzyme a wider channel is found that should allow binding and cleavage of larger, more structured substrates. Indeed, the bunyavirus enzyme is more active with a largely double-stranded RNA substrate (Reguera et al. 2010).",

Recently, the first part of an arenavirus L protein, namely, the N-terminal region of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), has been crystallized (Morin et al. 2010). The structure analysis of this fragment, denoted NL1, showed again a central fold composed of four mixed \u03b2-strands surrounded by seven \u03b1-helices. Also in this protein, the \u03b2-strands form a twisted plane creating a negatively charged cavity for binding of divalent cations. Even though the fifth beta strand is missing in NL1, a structure-based superimposition of the endonuclease-active sites from LCMV and influenza A virus revealed a striking similarity of these regions which included the positioning of the residues important for metal ion binding in PA-Nter. As with the bunyavirus enzyme, also the LCMV endonuclease shows some differences with regard to the influenza virus PA-Nter.

The functional experiments with the arenavirus enzyme showed that the presence of a 5\u2032 cap is not required for enzymatic activity in vitro. In fact, cleavage in close vicinity of a cap structure seemed to be not even preferred in these assays (Morin et al. 2010). It nevertheless has to be postulated that such substrate discriminating binding sites exist. Moreover, the activity of the endonucleases has to be regulated, for example, by allosteric effects in a way that it is activated only after binding of a cellular substrate RNA to prevent cleavage or decapping of nascent viral mRNAs during transcription. Recently, the cap-binding site in arenaviruses was demonstrated to reside in the N-terminal part of the arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) (Qi et al. 2010).

It was already known before that NP is engaged in blocking the induction of type 1 interferon (IFN-1) expression in the arenavirus infected cell thereby impairing the innate immune response of the host. Qi and coworkers (2010) showed that the repression of the interferon response is dependent on the exonuclease activity in NP, whereas cap snatching and transcription is also detected when the exonuclease is inactivated by mutation. NP interacts with RIG-I and MDA5, two RNA helicases that serve as detectors of so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) in intracellular interferon induction pathways (Zhou et al. 2010).

In contrast to their cellular homologs, nidovirus ExoN domains contain a putative zinc-binding domain that is located between motifs I and II (Snijder et al. 2003). In roniviruses, a second putative zinc-binding domain was identified between motifs II and III (Sittidilokratna et al. 2008; Snijder et al. 2003). Bacterially expressed SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp14 was shown to possess 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity that, in contrast to many cellular DEDD exonucleases, acts exclusively on RNA (Minskaia et al. 2006). Ribonucleolytic activity was found to require Mg2+ or Mn2+ or low concentrations of Zn2+ as a cofactor, while Ca2+ or high concentrations of Zn2+ inhibited activity. Substitutions of any of the four strictly conserved active-site residues (D-E-D-D) by Ala were shown to abolish or significantly reduce nucleolytic activity, supporting previous predictions on the critical role of these residues in catalysis (Minskaia et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Initial studies using human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) ExoN active-site mutants generated by reverse genetics revealed a critical importance of ExoN in viral RNA synthesis (Minskaia et al. 2006). Accumulation of viral RNA was severely reduced, and viable virus progeny could not be obtained in these experiments. By contrast, viable ExoN active-site mutants could be obtained for SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59), although RNA synthesis and virus reproduction was again found to be significantly reduced (Eckerle et al. 2007, 2010). Consistent with the proposed role of ExoN in proofreading, mutation frequencies (determined for viable MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV ExoN mutants) were reported to be significantly (more than 15-fold) increased in ExoN mutants when compared to wild-type virus(es) (Eckerle et al. 2007, 2010). SARS-CoV ExoN mutants also displayed a higher diversity within the virus population. Interestingly, the extent of genome diversity remained essentially unchanged when ExoN mutants were passaged in cell culture, suggesting counterselection of deleterious mutations. A higher-than-average replication fidelity was calculated for (wild-type) SARS-CoV and MHV (9.0 \u00d7 10\u20137 and 2.5 \u00d7 10\u20136 substitutions, respectively, per nucleotide per replication cycle) when compared to other RNA viruses, while replication fidelities of SARS-CoV and MHV ExoN mutants were similar to those reported for other RNA viruses (Eckerle et al. 2010). As calculations were done on infectious viruses in this study, mutation frequencies likely represent an underestimate of the actual number of mutations occurring during viral replication. Overall, however, the data support the idea that ExoN has a role in keeping replication fidelity at a (high) level typical for small DNA (rather than RNA) viruses (Cuevas et al. 2009). Although a direct proof for ExoN acting as a proofreading exoribonuclease remains to be obtained, the available information would support this hypothesis (Eckerle et al. 2007, 2010).",

Coronavirus NendoUs form hexamers comprised of dimers of trimers (Bhardwaj et al. 2006, 2008; Ricagno et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2006). The monomers have an \u03b1 + \u03b2 structure comprised of three domains, with the nidovirus-wide conserved domain (den Boon et al. 1991) representing the C-terminal subdomain of the protein (Fig. 6.4). The NendoU hexamer forms a three petal-shaped surface that surrounds a small, predominantly negatively charged central channel with an inner diameter of ~15 \u00c5. The two trimers interact head to head, mainly involving the N-terminal domains, while the C-termini are located at the surface where they form six independent active sites. Inter-monomer interactions are largely mediated by residues of the N-terminal and central domains (Ricagno et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2006).\n",

The proposed coronavirus NendoU catalytic His and Lys residues cluster inside a positively charged groove of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 6.4) (Ricagno et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2006) and mutagenesis data confirmed their critical role in nuclease activity (Bhardwaj et al. 2008; Ivanov et al. 2004; Kang et al. 2007). Additional active-site residues were implicated in binding of the substrate phosphate. These involve the side chain of a highly conserved Thr (Thr-340 in SARS-CoV nsp15, Fig. 6.4) and the main chain amide of a conserved Gly residue (Gly-247 in SARS-CoV nsp15, Fig. 6.4) (Bhardwaj et al. 2008; Ivanov et al. 2004; Kang et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2006). Although the NendoU reaction mechanism has not been analyzed in detail, it is generally thought to be similar to that of RNase A. This is supported by (1) similar spatial positions of the putative catalytic His and Lys residue(s) in the structure (see above), (2) the production of 2\u2032,3\u2032 cyclic phosphate-containing reaction products (Bhardwaj et al. 2008; Ivanov et al. 2004), and (3) the production of 3\u2032-hydroxyl ends after extended reaction times using recombinant forms of NendoU.",

Thus, in the RNase A structure, Thr-45 and Phe-120, which are known to contribute to pyrimidine specificity by forming hydrogen bonds (Thr-45) or stacking interactions (Phe-120) with the pyrimidine base (Raines 1998) occupy positions that are similar to those of two Ser/Thr and Tyr residues conserved in coronavirus and arterivirus NendoUs (Ser-293 and Tyr-342 in SARS-CoV nsp15; Fig. 6.4). Molecular modeling of uridine 3\u2032-monophosphate binding to the SARS-CoV NendoU active site and mutagenesis data provided further evidence for a role of Ser-293 and Tyr-342 in substrate binding and specificity (Bhardwaj et al. 2008; Nedialkova et al. 2009; Ricagno et al. 2006). Thus, substitutions with Ala of Ser-293 in SARS-CoV nsp15 and Ser-228 in EAV nsp11 resulted in enzymes that had essentially lost their preference for uridine over cytidine. By contrast, specificity and activity were restored when the same Ser residues were substituted with Thr (Bhardwaj et al. 2008; Nedialkova et al. 2009). In addition, Pro-343 and Leu-345 (SARS-CoV nsp15 numbering) were implicated in uridylate specificity, again supported by mutagenesis data (Bhardwaj et al. 2008).",

Whereas the nucleolytic activities of the cellular NendoU homologs, XendoU and human placental protein (PP11), and coronavirus NendoUs depend on (or are stimulated by) Mn2+ ions (Bhardwaj et al. 2004, 2008; Ivanov et al. 2004; Laneve et al. 2003, 2008), arterivirus NendoU activities do not appear to require metal ions (Nedialkova et al. 2009). At low concentrations of Mn2+, the activities of bacterially expressed equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) NendoUs were only slightly enhanced and, at higher concentrations, activities were found to be inhibited. The observed critical (or, at least, supportive) role of metal ions in most NendoU/XendoU homologs characterized to date is inconsistent with the proposed RNase A-like (metal-independent) reaction mechanism and structural studies did not reveal metal-binding sites in these enzymes (Renzi et al. 2006; Ricagno et al. 2006), thus questioning the requirement for Mn2+ ions in nuclease activity. Mn2+ ions were found to affect the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of SARS-CoV nsp15, suggesting that metal ion binding can induce conformational changes in the protein which were suggested to affect RNA binding (Bhardwaj et al. 2006; Guarino et al. 2005). Surprisingly, Mn2+ ions stimulated the RNA-binding activity of SARS-CoV nsp15 but not that of XendoU (Bhardwaj et al. 2006; Gioia et al. 2005).",

This is supported by the conservation and functional relevance of residues predicted by structural and biochemical studies to stabilize intersubunit interactions in the trimer and hexamer. Also, a structure analysis of a truncated form of SARS-CoV nsp15, which lacked 28 N-terminal and 11 C-terminal residues and was monomeric, revealed that two loops of the catalytic domain were displaced compared to their location in the hexamer, causing major changes in the active site geometry and loss of activity (Joseph et al. 2007). On the basis of these observations, hexamerization has been suggested to act as an allosteric switch required to activate these enzymes. If confirmed, this regulatory mechanism would not apply to EAV nsp11 and XendoU, both of which were reported to be monomeric in solution (Nedialkova et al. 2009; Renzi et al. 2006).",

Substitution of coronavirus NendoU active-site residues by reverse genetics resulted in a slight reduction of both genomic and subgenomic (sg) RNA synthesis in MHV (Kang et al. 2007) and a slight reduction in virus reproduction. No significant differences in plaque size were observed for NendoU mutants compared to wild-type MHV. In striking contrast, NendoU active-site substitutions caused profound defects in arterivirus reproduction, with virus titers being reduced by up to five log in a few cases. Several substitutions in the EAV NendoU resulted in a selective reduction of sgRNA synthesis compared to genome replication. Substitutions that, based on the available structure information for coronavirus NendoU, are predicted to cause major structural changes in NendoU (and, possibly, the polyprotein) abolished RNA synthesis in EAV and HCoV-229E completely (Ivanov et al. 2004; Posthuma et al. 2006). Taken together, the data suggest that NendoU domains may have nonidentical roles and/or substrates in different nidovirus families/subfamilies/genera, possibly reflecting adaptation to specific hosts and/or ecological niches (Lei et al. 2009).",

In addition, a complex of vhs with eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4H (see also below), partially purified from recombinant E. coli, showed RNase activity (Everly et al. 2002).

One of these cellular homologs is FEN-1, a nuclease engaged in the removal of RNA primers used for synthesis of Okazaki fragments during eukaryotic DNA replication.

It requires single-stranded RNA and cleaves 3\u2032 of C and U residues, a substrate specificity equivalent to that of RNase A (Taddeo and Roizman 2006). However, when expressed within a living cell, this unusual enzyme selectively targets cellular and viral mRNAs while sparing other ribonucleic acids. This substrate specificity under physiological conditions seems to be not mediated by direct recognition of one of the mRNA specific modifications 5\u2032 cap or 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. Instead, vhs interacts with cellular proteins that represent components of the translation initiation complex, such as initiation factor eIF4H was demonstrated (Feng et al. 2001). Since eIF4H associates with eIF4A, a component of the cap-binding complex, vhs could be attached to the 5\u2032 ends of mRNAs via an initiation factor bridge. In agreement with this hypothesis, it was reported for different mRNAs that vhs degradation starts close to the 5\u2032 end (Elgadi et al. 1999; Karr and Read 1999). Along those lines, it also has to be mentioned that vhs cleaves the cap-less picornavirus RNAs immediately downstream of the so-called internal ribosomal binding site (IRES), whereas other cap-less mRNAs like cellular IRES-containing mRNAs are not degraded (Elgadi and Smiley 1999). Picornavirus IRES recruit most of the canonical initiation factors to the viral RNAs, whereas the cellular IRES elements function without many of these factors. Thus, even though mere tethering of vhs to the cap-binding complex is not sufficient for mRNA degradation (Page and Read 2010), it can be hypothesized that the vhs specificity for mRNAs is mediated by components of the host cellular translation initiation system.",

Several mRNAs were found to be cleaved at a site close to the 3\u2032 end despite the presence of a 5\u2032 cap structure. According to these data, at least three classes of mRNAs can be distinguished based on their fate after infection (Corcoran et al. 2006; Smiley 2004; Taddeo et al. 2010). The mRNAs of housekeeping genes such as GAPDH or \u03b2-actin are rapidly degraded. At least some inducible genes generating mRNAs with AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032 nontranslated regions are deadenylated and cleaved endonucleolytically close to their 3\u2032 end giving rise to 5\u2032 fragments that persist for hours before 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 degradation occurs. Several stress-inducible genes coding for proteins with regulatory functions like IEX-1, c-fos, or the \u03b1 subunit of the inhibitor of nuclear factor \u03baB (I\u03baB\u03b1) belong to this group. A third class of mRNAs, which are derived from inducible genes encoding, for example, tristetraprolin (TTP) is not degraded at all, so that the encoded proteins accumulate in the infected cells. Since TTP binds both to vhs and AREs of mRNAs (Esclatine et al. 2004), the vhs-induced cleavage of the latter was hypothesized to be mediated by TTP (Chen et al. 2001; Lykke-Andersen and Wagner 2005).",

            "text": "The RNase activity of vhs seems to be essentially modulated by at least three viral proteins. Two of these proteins, VP16 and VP22, are also present in the viral tegument (Fig. 6.5), and therefore already delivered to the newly infected cells. VP16 alone is able to associate with vhs, whereas VP22 cannot bind vhs but interacts with it only via VP16. The interaction of vhs with these two proteins is believed to interfere with the RNase activity and to be necessary for an appropriate level of viral gene expression in the early phase of the infection. However, it is not clear whether this effect is achieved alone by limiting mRNA degradation. Instead, there is evidence that these two proteins also function through enabling mRNA translation (Taddeo et al. 2007). In addition, a third protein termed ICP27 was shown to be also involved in modulation of vhs activity (Corcoran et al. 2006; Taddeo et al. 2010). ICP27 is an immediate early protein of HSV with different functions in regulation of viral and cellular gene expression. It stimulates transcription and translation of viral mRNA and contributes to HSV host shutoff by downregulation of host transcription and blocking of nuclear export of host cellular mRNAs. Moreover, ICP27 seems to be important for the specificity of vhs activity, but the exact role of ICP27 is still a matter of debate. It seems to interact with vhs bound to cap-and poly(A)-binding proteins. It is also essential for the synthesis of new vhs in the late phase of the viral replication cycle. The absence of ICP27 leads to degradation of mRNAs with AREs late after infection, which was proposed to result from a stabilizing effect of ICP27 on these RNAs (Corcoran et al. 2006) or the absence of the protective effect of vhs itself because of the absence of the newly synthesized vhs (Taddeo et al. 2010).",

Nevertheless, vhs is found in all alphaherpesviruses so that it likely plays an important role in the biology of these viruses. In fact, vhs-negative HSV is strongly attenuated. In accordance with its name, a primary function of vhs is certainly the shutoff of host cellular gene expression. At least the concentration of most stably expressed cellular mRNAs is lowered dramatically in the early phase of the replication cycle. Moreover, the function of the translational apparatus is altered so that the translation of most of the residual mRNAs is severely impaired. As a consequence, higher capacities of the translation system are available for the synthesis of viral proteins. However, it is obvious that vhs also degrades viral mRNAs so that maximization of viral gene expression seems to be not the final aim. In fact, vhs also ensures the rapid turnover of viral mRNAs, a process that is needed to regulate the progression of the replication cycle from the immediate early to the early and then to the late phase.",

It is involved in the loss of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II from the surface of infected cells (Ambagala et al. 2000; Gopinath et al. 2002; Hinkley et al. 2000; Koppers-Lalic et al. 2001; Tigges et al. 1996). Moreover, the production of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines is hampered by HSV infection (Suzutani et al. 2000). Recently, vhs has been shown to functionally inactivate human monocyte\u2013derived dendritic cells (Samady et al. 2003). Collectively, vhs activity dampens the innate and both arms of the adaptive immune system. The effects of vhs on the host immune system are regarded as the major cause for the attenuation of vhs deletion mutants. Vhs deletion mutants have been shown to induce very robust immune responses in experimentally infected animals and, consequently, deletion of vhs is regarded as one possible step during the establishment of novel vaccines against alphaherpesviruses. It also has to be mentioned that its ability to help block the host immune response seems to be the major reason for conservation of vhs among alphaherpesviruses since the ability of vhs to induce host shutoff varies considerably from HSV-2 (very strong shutoff) to HSV-1 (strong shutoff), pseudorabies virus (moderate shutoff) and equine herpesvirus (no detectable host shutoff) (Smiley 2004).",

Pestiviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that are classified as one genus in the family Flaviviridae because of their general genome organization and strategy of gene expression. The pestiviral genome encodes a single polyprotein of roughly 4,000 amino acids that is cleaved into 12 mature viral proteins by cellular and viral proteases. Four of these proteins are found in the virus particle, a capsid protein C and three glycosylated proteins embedded into the viral envelope membrane (Fig. 6.6). The presence of three envelope proteins represents a special feature of pestiviruses, whereas the closely related human hepatitis C viruses (HCV) have only two envelope proteins. With regard to location in the polyprotein, biochemical properties, and presumed function, the glycoproteins E1 and E2 of pestiviruses are thought to be equivalent to E1 and E2 of HCV, respectively. Thus, the so-called Erns protein (envelope, ribonuclease secreted), formerly termed E0, located in the polyprotein between C and E1 seems to represent the additional acquirement of pestiviruses.\n",

Erns represents the only known viral surface protein that exhibits RNase activity (Hulst et al. 1994; Schneider et al. 1993). Erns was identified as ribonuclease because of two short stretches within the N-terminal half of the protein (Box A LH\n30\nGIWP and Box B H\nEWNKH\n79\nGWC) that displayed homology to ribonucleases of the T2 family (Fig. 6.6). Ribonucleases of the T2 family are transferase-type RNases and are classified by their similarity to RNase T2 from Aspergillus oryzae (Luhtala and Parker 2010). T2 RNases are widespread among bacteria, protozoa, plants, insects, vertebrates, and viruses. T2 RNases are endonucleases that typically have their enzymatic optima at acidic pH (pH 4\u20135). This acidic activity of T2 RNases correlates with their localization in lysosomal or vacuolar compartments. Most T2 RNases have little substrate specificity and cleave phosphodiester bonds at all four bases (Luhtala and Parker 2010). Biochemical characterization of the Erns activity revealed that various heteropolymeric RNA molecules such as ribosomal RNA or pestivirus genomic RNA were susceptible to Erns activity (Hulst et al. 1994; Schneider et al. 1993; Windisch et al. 1996). Of single-stranded homopolymeric RNA molecules, only polyrU was cleaved while polyrA, polyrG, and polyrC were resistant to Erns degradation (Schneider et al. 1993; Windisch et al. 1996). Addition of the complementary homopolymer (polyrA) to the polyrU resulted in massively reduced degradation indicating the inability of Erns to accept double-stranded RNA as substrate. In conflict with this observation is experimental evidence that suggests that Erns also degrades dsRNA such as poly IC (Iqbal et al. 2004) or double-stranded transcripts (Magkouras et al. 2008; M\u00e4tzener et al. 2009). Erns is insensitive to chelating agents such as EDTA or EGTA, and can be inhibited with Mn2+ and Zn2+ ions. Zn2+ leads at 15 \u03bcM concentration to a 50% reduction of Erns activity likely because of the interaction with histidine residues His-30 and His-79 that were shown to be essential for RNase activity (Meyers et al. 1999).",

In the case of Erns, NpU sites represent the preferred substrate and the size of the cleavage products depends on the distribution and accessibility of uridine residues. Analysis of the cleavage products of Erns digested RNA molecules with known cleavage sites gave a different picture. Depending on the enzyme concentrations, the expected cleavage products were completely degraded to mononucleotides or shorter molecules forming a \u201cladder\u201d of 5\u2032 coterminal fragments. This led to the assumption that the endonuclease Erns possesses an additional exonucleolytic activity. This exonucleolytic activity of Erns is only apparent with substrates that contain at least one uridine residue, and an endonucleolytic cleavage is required before exonucleolytic degradation ensues. Interestingly, a comparable activity has not been reported for other T2 RNases, and it is currently not understood how a uridine-specific endonuclease switches to a substrate-independent exonuclease. A hypothetical 3D structure modeled on the basis of an RNase Rh template was published (Langedijk et al. 2002), but this model does not allow conclusions with regard to the molecular basis of substrate recognition of Erns. However, crystal structure analysis of Erns is in progress (T. Krey, personal communication) so that deeper elucidation of this interesting enzyme will hopefully be possible soon.",

Experimental work showed that highly purified Erns protein was able to degrade viral genomic RNA isolated from virions demonstrating the absence of a modification preventing cleavage of the viral RNA (Windisch et al. 1996). Protection of the viral genome could also be achieved by separating the genomic RNA and the RNase through membranes. Since mature Erns is highly glycosylated and contains four intramolecular disulfide bonds, folding of the protein into its enzymatically active form could well be dependent on its translocation into the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). As a matter of fact, prevention of translocation by expression of Erns without signal sequence resulted in an inactive form of the protein exhibiting no RNase activity (Meyers, unpublished results). Since membrane topology of viral envelope proteins and genome is conserved during budding and membrane fusion in the course of infection, it can be concluded that active RNase and viral genome are always separated by membranes which prevents degradation of the viral genome by its own RNase.",

However, around day 7\u201310 post infection, the animals were apparently able to control the RNase-negative virus and recovered whereas the amount of wild-type virus increased dramatically resulting in very severe symptoms of disease. Despite the early control of the RNase-negative virus, the animals infected with the mutant virus showed a potent antiviral immune response able to protect from a stringent challenge infection (Meyer et al. 2002; Meyers et al. 1999).

The latter type of response relies on a powerful, antigen-specific system designed for final clearance of the invading pathogen. Since, however, the development of an adaptive immune response takes a rather long time, a first line of defense is necessary to prevent uncontrolled amplification of the pathogen. This first line of defense is established by the innate immune system relying on the identification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Janeway 1989). In RNA viruses, PAMPs are molecular structures like double-stranded RNA or cytoplasmic RNA with a 5\u2032 triphosphate structure which are not found in eukaryotic cells, and therefore specific for the pathogens (Hengel et al. 2005; Takeda and Akira 2004). Binding of such a molecular structure by a PAMP-specific receptor triggers a cascade of reactions among which the synthesis and secretion of type I interferon represents one of the earliest and most important steps. Secretion of IFN-1 induces an antiviral state in the infected as well as in neighboring cells characterized by a whole set of events aiming at repression of pathogen replication. This first line of defense represents a serious barrier for viruses so that most, if not all of them, have evolved mechanisms counteracting the innate immune system especially at the level of the IFN-1 response (Hengel et al. 2005).",

The high affinity to single-stranded RNA and the postulated exonuclease activity of Erns support the assumption that Erns is involved in degrading viral RNA molecules that could stimulate endosomal (Toll like receptors 3, 7, 8) or cytoplasmic innate immunity sensors (MDA5 and RIG-I). The low k\nm facilitates interaction of minute concentrations of Erns with target RNA molecules, that is, in the endosomal compartment. Since endonucleolytic cleavage results in a molar increase of breakdown products that still are sensed as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), it is probably beneficial for the survival of pestiviruses to fully degrade these fragments by the exonucleolytic activity of Erns.",

This was definitely an effect initiated extracellularly since Erns could not block the induction of interferon after transfection of Poly-IC. In vitro experiments showed that Erns was indeed able to bind and degrade dsRNA, even though the requirements necessary for hydrolysis of dsRNA were different in two labs (Iqbal et al. 2004; Magkouras et al. 2008; M\u00e4tzener et al. 2009). Thus, the hypothesis was put forward that secreted Erns was responsible for blocking an interferon response to extracellular dsRNA. This conclusion is in agreement with the published results, but has to be questioned in some points mainly because the origin of dsRNA in the extracellular milieu in an infected animal is obscure. This dsRNA should directly result from virus infection but since the overwhelming amount of pestiviruses are not cytopathic (Meyers and Thiel 1996; Thiel et al. 1996), lysis of considerable numbers of infected cells containing viral dsRNA is unlikely. It is therefore not clear where the dsRNA substrate to be degraded by the Erns RNase should come from. It also has to be stressed that Erns is much more active on single-stranded RNA and could therefore be regarded as a predominantly ssRNA-specific RNase. If dsRNA was the main substrate of this RNase, one could expect that evolution would have taken a different way.",

            "text": "A formal proof for the involvement of the Erns RNase in the prevention of innate immunological control of virus infection was obtained in a special animal model. Pestiviruses are known to establish long-lasting persistent infections when introduced into the fetus in a pregnant host animal (Thiel et al. 1996). This process is best understood for the pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Fig. 6.7). Intrauterine infection of a fetus in the first trimester (day 40\u2013120) of gestation by noncytopathic BVDV may lead to viral persistence accompanied by an acquired immunotolerance with high specificity for the infecting virus strain (Fig. 6.7). It is generally believed that self-reactive elements of the adaptive immune system, including the ones directed against the persisting virus, are inactivated in this developmental stage. Thus, the developing individuals do not produce an adaptive immune response against the persisting virus strain for their lifetime (Thiel et al. 1996). Furthermore, the virus is protected against the immune response of the mother cow by the barrier established by the bovine placenta that cannot be crossed by antibodies. To maintain a persistent infection for years, BVDV has to deal also with the innate immune system of the host. As a matter of fact, persistently infected fetuses or calves do not mount an IFN-1 response despite massive virus replication resulting in large amounts of PAMPs (Charleston et al. 2001). The absence of innate immune reactions is regarded as an important contribution to viral persistence.\n",

Similar results were also obtained for Npro deletion mutants.
