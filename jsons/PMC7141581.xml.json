Procedures should be postponed if possible until such symptoms have resolved or testing (if available) is negative. If procedures cannot be postponed as determined by the clinical indication, the procedure should be performed using the precautions as outlined above for bronchoscopy in suspected COVID-19 infection.In communities with high prevalence of COVID-19 infections, even for routine bronchoscopies in asymptomatic patients, proper isolation precautions should be adhered to while also limiting the number of personnel to essential personnel present in either the bronchoscopy suite or operating room suite with negative pressure room settings or designated isolation room (Airborne Infection Isolation Room).",

Elective indications include a lung mass, bronchial mass, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, lung infiltrates, and mild to moderate airway stenosis.If immediate testing is not available, bronchoscopy should be deferred if possible.Bronchoscopy (flexible and rigid) for urgent/emergent reasons should be considered only if a lifesaving bronchoscopic intervention is deemed necessary.
