In light of the lack of validated effective therapeutic approaches, the medications that could ameliorate fever, fatigue and coughing would be valuable for the clinical management of Covid-19. LH capsules, which is a patented product, have been marketed since the outbreak of SARS in 2003 in China. The latest research showed that LH conferred suppression of the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and reduced the viral loads in the cytoplasm and cellular membrane . LH could also suppress the replication of SARS-CoV (Zhu et al., 2003) , H3N2, H1N1 and H7N9 in vitro (Chinese Academy Of Military Hospital, 2009; Ding et al., 2017; Duan et al., 2011; Mo et al., 2007) . The inflammatory cytokine storm has been regarded as an excessive host-defense response to the virus Zhe Xu, 2020) , which can cause diffuse lung injury and predispose to the development of severe disease. Suppression of excessive release of inflammatory meditators is the Holy Grail for halting the progression to severe disease . Recent studies indicated that LH could dose-dependently inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, macrophage chemokine protein-1 and induced protein-10 , and could also effectively abrogate the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-2, interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 (Mo et al., 2007) , thus ameliorating lung injury associated with inflammatory cell infiltration (Cui et al., 2015) . These in vitro findings have provided with the rationale for clinical application of LH capsules in Covid-19.",

In light of the efficacy and safety profiles, LH capsules could be considered for the treatment of Covid-19. Future double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of LH capsules in a larger patient population. We also thank the patients, the study investigators and their staff, and the study team for participating in this study.",

Shanghai University of traditional Chinese medicine contributed to statistical analysis. All authors contributed toward data analysis, drafting and revising the paper and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work. We defined the clinical cure as having met all of the following criteria: recovery of body temperature for more than 3 days, symptom recovery, marked improvement in chest CT images, and two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing (at least one day apart). An improvement in chest CT images was defined as a decreased area of infiltration, a decreased area of any radiologic abnormality, or decreased density of the ground-glass opacity or nodules. ",
