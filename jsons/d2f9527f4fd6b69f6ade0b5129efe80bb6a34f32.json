As the earliest aid in bulk to arrive, these supplies helped calm the public panic. 8 Meanwhile, following the principle of \"special methods for special events,\" the Chinese Government immediately sent to Africa an epidemic-prevention team composed of nine experts in epidemiology, virology, and testing. The team assisted the local Embassy in allocating supplies; held training on correct use of aid supplies; provided professional technical guidance for Ebola prevention and control in the affected countries; helped improve the capacity to respond to public health crises; held epidemic prevention and control training for the Embassy, Chinese agencies, peacekeeping forces and medical teams in Africa under the coordination of the Embassy; 9 and communicated with WHO, Doctors Without Borders and other aid agencies and organizations. 10 The medical teams sent by China were also actively involved in the clinical treatment of Ebola patients in the affected areas.",

On September 16, China sent the CDC mobile laboratory testing team to Sierra Leone. The testing team was composed of two groups of people: the CDC experts who were designated with the task of virus detection; and the medical workers of No. 302 Hospital in Xiaotangshan, which played an important role in China's fight against SARS in 2003 and was responsible for management of the Ebola patients to be observed this time. The laboratory testing team worked mainly in the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Hospital, a Chinese foreign aid project. 16 The transportation of the mobile biosafety level 3 laboratory to Sierra Leone was launched on September 23 and was put into operation after testing and evaluation work on September 26. 17 On October 1, the laboratory was used for the first group of Ebola patients to be observed. 18 By October 31, the daily testing capacity reached more than 100 cases; the daily testing capacities of the USA, UK, Canadian, and South African laboratories at the same time were 70, 46, 11, and 0 cases, respectively. 19 The project of the fixed biosafety level 3 laboratory was launched on November 21 20 and completed on January 30, 2015. 21 The observing center later evolved into a treatment center.",

In terms of financial aid, as of the first half of 2015, the Chinese Government had issued a total of four rounds of emergency humanitarian assistance worth 750 million yuan to the affected countries. In terms of personnel and capacity-building, the Chinese Government dispatched several groups of nearly 1200 medical personnel to support testing, diagnosis, treatment, training, and technical guidance in the affected countries. The vast majority of these experts worked in the field alongside their African counterparts. As for facilities, China provided a mobile level 3 biosafety laboratory, constructed the first fixed level 3 biosafety laboratory in West Africa, and transformed the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Hospital into an observation, diagnosis, and treatment center with the function of curing patients with infectious diseases. Within 1 month, China built a modern infectious disease treatment center with 100 beds for Liberia. In terms of technological innovation, China launched research on Ebola detection and diagnosis technology, drugs, vaccines, and protective equipment, and made a number of technological breakthroughs. And regarding supplies, the Chinese Government provided a full range of material assistance, including individual protective articles, disinfectants, detection equipment, mobile X-ray machines and other medical equipment, food, beds, incinerators, ambulances, motorcycles, and pickup trucks. 34 The first four rounds of aid focused on crisis response, controlling the spread of infectious diseases, and direct support for building emergency response teams for public health emergencies and capacity-building of relevant medical agencies.",

For example, China and the AU have continued their cooperation to establish an African CDC to strengthen the continent's disease surveillance capacity. This is being done through collaborative efforts with international society, including WHO and other traditional donors. The level 3 biosafety laboratory has also evolved into a platform for cooperation between China and the host country, as well as institutions and organizations from other countries, for research activities and disease control, with ongoing training activities and policy outcomes in the pipeline.
