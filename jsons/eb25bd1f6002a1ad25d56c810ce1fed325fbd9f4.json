            "text": "Following a preliminary section, we begin in Section 2 by establishing our characterizations of precompactness (Theorems 2.1 and 2 2 ) , and then relate these to the known results in this direction. Further, in the case of a FRI~CHET range space, we obtain nonlinear variants (Theorem 2.4) on factorization of compact operators through reflexive BANACH spaces. In Section 3, we focus on asymptotic behavior of vector valued continuous functions defined on a subinterval [a, CQ) of the real line, using our general compactness criteria to extend and unify results connecting such behavior with various periodicity conditions that occur in this context. The central notion is that of a vector valued asymptotically almost periodic functionan idea that was introduced more than forty years ago by M. I?&CHET [19] , [20] . Of course, many of FRBCHEX'S original kzrguments for finite dimensional range spaces can be adapted to the case of functions taking values in arbitrary BANACH spaces. However, the extent to which these results carry over is apparently not in the realm of general knowledge, aiid we exploit our methods to provide a comprehensive treatment of this important concept. Another aspect of this third section is based upon interpretation of the nonlinear factorization result from Section 2 in the setting at hand. We then bring the paper to an end with a fourth section in which we apply our compactness criteria to resolve a question concerning the approximation property for weighted spaces of vector valued continuous functions.

Since the equicontinuity of R+ makes it possible to trivially cover [a, N] by finitely mmy sets of this same prescribed form, we see that 3. (ii) of Theorem 2.2. is indeed eetisfied, whereby flf isprecompact in Clb(J,, X). I n case T = R and H is cs x-precompct and equi-almost periodic subset of C(R, X), the foregoing argument can readily be adapted to Show that R = {h, : h< H , w e R) is a precompact subset of CI,(R, X); the details are left to the render. I n the converse direction, rcsmme that 2. holds. Then 1. (i) is clearly satisfied. Moreover, keeping Theorem 5.1 in mind, R (respectively, U*) is a precompnct subset of Cl,(R, X) (respectively, Cl,(J,, X)). whereby Theorem 5.2 can be brought to bear in showing that H is equi-almost periodic (respectively, eyuiasymptotically aFmogt periodic). Fixing q c c s ( X ) and E~O , we use 3.
