The 3D structures of the target proteins are best determined by experimental methods that yield solutions at atomic resolution, such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.9 Recent developments in the techniques of experimental structure determination have enhanced the applicability, accuracy, and speed of structural studies.10, 11 Despite these advances, however, structural characterization of sequences remains an expensive and time-consuming task.",

The speed, low cost, and relative accuracy of these computational methods have led to the use of predicted 3D structures in the drug discovery process.24, 25 The other class of prediction methods, de novo or ab initio methods, attempts to predict the structure from sequence alone, without reliance on evolutionary relationships. However, despite recent progress in these methods,26 especially for small proteins with fewer than 100 amino acid residues, comparative modeling remains the most reliable method of predicting the 3D structure of a protein, with an accuracy that can be comparable to a low-resolution, experimentally determined structure.9\n",

The impact of structural genomics is illustrated by comparative modeling based on the structures determined by the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium. For each new structure, on average, 100 protein sequences without any prior structural characterization could be modeled at least at the level of the fold.32 Thus, the structures of most proteins will eventually be predicted by computation, not determined by experiment.",

Next, we emphasize two aspects of model refinement, loop modeling and side-chain modeling, due to their relevance in ligand docking and rational drug discovery. We then discuss the errors in comparative models. Finally, we describe the role of comparative modeling in drug discovery, focusing on ligand docking against comparative models. We compare successes of docking against models and x-ray structures, and illustrate the computational docking against models with a number of examples. We conclude with a summary of topics that will impact on the future utility of comparative modeling in drug discovery, including an automation and integration of resources required for comparative modeling and ligand docking.",

The information in a multiple sequence alignment is most often encoded as either a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)36, 40, 41 or as a hidden Markov model (HMM).42, 43 In order to identify suitable templates for comparative modeling, the profile of the target sequence is used to search against a database of template sequences. The profile\u2013sequence methods are more sensitive in detecting related structures in the twilight zone than the pairwise sequence-based methods; they detect approximately twice the number of homologs under 40% sequence identity.44, 45, 46 The resulting profile\u2013sequence alignments correctly align approximately 43\u201348% of residues in the 0\u201340% sequence identity range46, 47; this number is almost twice as large as that of the pairwise sequence methods.

The accuracy of a sequence\u2013structure match is assessed by the score of a corresponding coarse model and not by sequence similarity, as in sequence comparison methods.21 The scoring scheme used to evaluate the accuracy is either based on residue substitution tables dependent on structural features such as solvent exposure, secondary structure type, and hydrogen bonding properties,53, 61, 62, 63 or on statistical potentials for residue interactions implied by the alignment.64, 65, 66, 67, 68 The use of structural data does not have to be restricted to the structure side of the aligned sequence\u2013structure pair. For example, SAM-T02 makes use of the predicted local structure for the target sequence to enhance homolog detection and alignment accuracy.69 Commonly used threading programs are GenTHREADER,61, 70 3D-PSSM,71 FUGUE,63 SP3,53 and SAM-T02 multitrack HMM.62, 69\n",

The spatial restraints, expressed as probability density functions, are combined into an objective function that is optimized by a combination of conjugate gradients and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing.

However, it is important that a modeling method allows a degree of flexibility and automation to obtain better models more easily and rapidly. For example, a method should allow for an easy recalculation of a model when a change is made in the alignment; it should be straightforward to calculate models based on several templates; and the method should provide tools for incorporation of prior knowledge about the target (e.g., cross-linking restraints and predicted secondary structure).",

In this range of overall similarity, loops among the homologs vary while the core regions are still relatively conserved and aligned accurately. Loops often play an important role in defining the functional specificity of a given protein, forming the active and binding sites. Loop modeling can be seen as a mini protein folding problem because the correct conformation of a given segment of a polypeptide chain has to be calculated mainly from the sequence of the segment itself. However, loops are generally too short to provide sufficient information about their local fold. Even identical decapeptides in different proteins do not always have the same conformation.104, 105 Some additional restraints are provided by the core anchor regions that span the loop and by the structure of the rest of the protein that cradles the loop. Although many loop-modeling methods have been described, it is still challenging to correctly and confidently model loops longer than approximately 8\u201310 residues.98, 106\n",

As a result, only loops up to 4\u20137 residues long have most of their conceivable conformations present in the database of known protein structures.118, 119 This limitation is made even worse by the requirement for an overlap of at least one residue between the database fragment and the anchor core regions, which means that modeling a 5-residue insertion requires at least a 7-residue fragment from the database.89 Despite the rapid growth of the database of known structures, it does not seem possible to cover most of the conformations of a 9-residue segment in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, most of the insertions in a family of homologous proteins are shorter than 10\u201312 residues.98\n",

The search algorithms include the minimum perturbation method,120 molecular dynamics simulations,111, 121 genetic algorithms,122 Monte Carlo and simulated annealing,123, 124, 125 multiple-copy simultaneous search,126 self-consistent field optimization,127 and enumeration based on graph theory.128 The accuracy of loop predictions can be further improved by clustering the sampled loop conformations and partially accounting for the entropic contribution to the free energy.129 Another way of improving the accuracy of loop predictions is to consider the solvent effects. Improvements in implicit solvation models, such as the Generalized Born solvation model, motivated their use in loop modeling. The solvent contribution to the free energy can be added to the scoring function for optimization, or it can be used to rank the sampled loop conformations after they are generated with a scoring function that does not include the solvent terms.98, 130, 131, 132\n",

Comparative models for each of these enzymes were taken from MODBASE, a database of comparative models for all protein sequences that are detectably related to at least one known structure. The models were based on single template structures with sequence identities in the range of 28\u201387%. Each enzyme had multiple known inhibitors in the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database, a library of drug-like molecules where each molecule has been annotated by the receptor to which it binds. Success of the docking, carried out with the Shoichet group\u2019s version of DOCK,189, 190 was assessed by enrichment: the ability to distinguish known inhibitors from a large set of \u223c100 000 \u2018decoys\u2019 relative to random selection. As might be expected, the holo structures were the best at selecting the known ligands from among the MDDR decoys based on the docking score. Unexpectedly, the comparative models often ranked known ligands among the top-scoring database molecules; in four targets, the enrichment was 20 times higher than expected by chance.188 In one case, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, the modeled structure actually performed better than the holo structure. For the comparative model, 25% of the known ligands were found in the top 1.2% of the ranked database, whereas for the holo conformation, 2.8% of the ranked list had to be searched before 25% of the ligands were found. In another example, the holo structure of thymidylate synthase correctly recognized ligands similar in size to the ligand captured in the x-ray structure, but not ligands that were markedly different from it. In contrast, the binding sites in the modeled conformations were more spacious and could in fact correctly detect and accommodate larger ligands than the holo receptor (Figure 5\n). Thus, it appears that, while x-ray crystallographic structures remain the first choice in docking, many comparative models seem sufficiently accurate to rank highly known ligands from among a very large list of possible alternatives.",

Moreover, some residues in the binding site are significantly different; a trio of charged Asp residues in matriptase correspond to 1 Tyr and 2 Trp residues in thrombin. Thrombin was chosen as the template, in part because it prefers substrates with positively charged residues at the P1 position, as does matriptase. The comparative model was constructed using MODELLER and refined with MD simulations in CHARMM. The National Cancer Institute database was used for virtual screening that targeted the S1 site with the DOCK program. The 2000 best-scoring compounds were manually inspected to identify positively charged ligands (the S1 site is negatively charged), and 69 compounds were experimentally screened for inhibition, identifying the 15 inhibitors. One of them, hexamidine, was used as a lead to identify additional compounds selective for matriptase relative to thrombin.

Even the successful efforts appear to rely strongly on visual inspection of the docking results. Much work remains to be done to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of docking against comparative models. Despite assessments of relative successes of docking against comparative models and native x-ray structures,188, 202 surprisingly little has been done to compare the accuracy achievable by different approaches to comparative modeling and to identify the specific structural reasons why comparative models generally produce less accurate virtual screening results than the holo structures. Among the many issues that deserve consideration are the following:\u2022The inclusion of cofactors and bound water molecules in protein receptors is often critical for success of virtual screening; however, cofactors are not routinely included in comparative models\u2022Most docking programs currently retain the protein receptor in a completely rigid conformation. While this approach is appropriate for \u2018lock-and-key\u2019 binding modes, it does not work when the ligand induces conformational changes in the receptor upon binding. A flexible receptor approach is necessary to address such induced-fit cases211, 212\n\u2022The accuracy of comparative models is frequently judged by the C\u03b1 root mean square error or other similar measures of backbone accuracy. For virtual screening, however, the precise positioning of side chains in the binding site is likely to be critical; measures of accuracy for binding sites are needed to help evaluate the suitability of comparative modeling algorithms for constructing models for docking\u2022Knowledge of known inhibitors, either for the target protein or the template, should help to evaluate and improve virtual screening against comparative models. For example, comparative models constructed from holo\u2019 template structures implicitly preserve some information about the ligand-bound receptor conformation\u2022Improvement in the accuracy of models produced by comparative modeling will require methods that finely sample protein conformational space using a free energy or scoring function that has sufficient accuracy to distinguish the native structure from the nonnative conformations. Despite many years of development of molecular simulation methods, attempts to refine models that are already relatively close to the native structure have met with relatively little success. This failure is likely to be due in part to inaccuracies in the scoring functions used in the simulations, particularly in the treatment of electrostatics and solvation effects. A combination of physics-based energy function with the statistical information extracted from known protein structures may provide a route to the development of improved scoring functions\u2022Improvements in sampling strategies are also likely to be necessary, for both comparative modeling and flexible docking\n",

Despite unsolved problems in virtually every step of comparative modeling and ligand docking, it is highly desirable to automate the whole process, starting with the target sequence and ending with a ranked list of its putative ligands. Automation encourages development of better methods, improves their testing, allows application on a large scale, and makes the technology more accessible to both experts and nonspecialists alike. Through large-scale application, new questions, such as those about ligand-binding specificity, can in principle be addressed. Enabling a wider community to use the methods provides useful feedback and resources toward the development of the next generation of methods.",
