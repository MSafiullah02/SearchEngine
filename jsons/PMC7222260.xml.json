As with the approach to PAH patients, patients with PH must be evaluated in the context of the severity of their illness. Because there are no specific treatments for patients with PH, specific management strategies for these patients will not be addressed. CTEPH is in a unique position first, because a curative treatment is available in the form of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). However, in the absence of decompensated right heart failure (RHF), how urgently surgery should be performed is an issue that gets raised, especially when PEA is done best in a few select, specialized centers. In this manuscript, the discussions around PAH will also largely apply to CTEPH, with the acknowledgment that it is an area of uncertainty as to when and whether someone should go for PEA during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the anticipated increased needs for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and ventilators, plus the exposure risk associated with being hospitalized at this time.\n",

Currently, the most challenging aspect of ongoing care of PAH patients is considering \u201cexposure risk\u201d for patients coming to the clinic or hospital for follow-up and new appointments, including routine laboratory tests. Some programs are able to perform video visits for low-risk patients and to help determine if the intermediate and high-risk patients as well as those actively needing management require in-person evaluation. Many PAH providers serve several roles, as pulmonologists, cardiologists, pediatric specialists, intensivists, as well as caregivers and parents. As the inpatient needs increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians within PAH programs may be called to spend more time on inpatient services further limiting their ability to be readily available to their routine PAH patient care. Additionally, with providers spending time in isolation or caring for children, their ability to care for PAH patients will be further challenged. Finding means to streamline outpatient care during this time and offload physicians by utilization of advanced practice providers and nurses, telemedicine visits, as well as specialty pharmacies can greatly improve touch points with patients to prevent missing signs of worsening clinical and risk status.",

In this setting, PAH-providers may be able to work with companies for insurance provisional approval, during urgent or emergent initiation of therapy. The value of performing an elective RHC in patients with a high likelihood of Group 2 or Group 3 PH, where the benefit of PAH therapies has not been established,6 is discouraged unless the patient is severely ill, and it will change management. However, in such a case, that would not be elective. Additionally, for stable patients with high likelihood of having Group 2 and 3 PH, elective new patient evaluation should be deferred until a later date due to the lack of established therapies for these disease states at the moment. The COVID-19 pandemic is an opportune time to use risk likelihood tools on who would benefit from undergoing a RHC,7 and perhaps patients without RHF or those at lower risk of actually having PAH can have their RHC (and treatment) deferred in the short run.",

With current restrictions on travel and the practice of social distancing, there is less availability for nurses to access homes and hospitals for teaching and up-titrating of therapies.

This practice, although only consensus based, was developed because of the fragile nature of PAH patients and the lack of predictability for response to treatment, and the ongoing risk for disease progression in prevalent cases. Since patients can rapidly clinically deteriorate, PAH-specific risk scores advocate frequent follow-up to allow for a formal risk assessment during this time period as well. However, given the potential risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection by coming to a healthcare setting, patients with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease are being advised against non-essential travel and to practice social distancing. Thus, a risk/benefit analysis evaluating the need for in-person versus remote clinic visits, as well as the need for certain diagnostic tests, is in order in the current healthcare environment.",

Although there are limitations to telehealth, such as inability to do comprehensive physical exams and essential diagnostic testing, it is likely that many patients are capable of self-description of their PAH signs and symptoms and thus can guide their management. Additional limitations to telehealth include an inability to reliably measure vital signs, as well as patient accessibility to access audio and/or video conferencing technology and familiarity with these technologies, especially for patients with limited means. As telehealth evolves, new questions about delivery of care will certainly emerge which will need to be measured against doing what is best for the overall safety and well-being of the patient.",

With the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider the additive value of these sometimes comprehensive tests in the context of the risks associated with visiting the hospital or clinic to obtain them. While laboratory values for N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are often used as a surrogate for RHF in patients with PAH, there are risks for patients traveling to a laboratory to obtain these tests. In patients who are on anticoagulation for CTEPH, atrial fibrillation, pump infusion, or other reasons, it may be worth considering transitioning to direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight heparin to avoid the laboratory visit necessary to obtain and monitor a therapeutic International Normalised Ratio (INR) with warfarin use. Similar to procedures which will be limited during this time, such as echocardiogram, it is worth reconsidering whether any of the tests performed for routine follow-up change clinical management sufficiently to warrant the risk of getting the test performed.",

In particular, PAH patients will have great difficulty surviving these types of interventions which poses a significant opportunity cost during a pandemic that is stretching the health care system. It is anticipated that there will be shortages of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic, which poses even further concern for their utility in this population.
