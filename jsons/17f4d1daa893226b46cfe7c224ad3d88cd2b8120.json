            "text": "As the world grapples with the public health emergency and economic crisis from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, developing countries become the most vulnerable to its profound negative impact. The current struggles of developed countries in responding to the pandemic despite their wealth of resources, solid economies, and established healthcare infrastructures are magnified and intensified for developing countries. Challenges of meeting even the most basic health needs in developing countries become much more acute in the setting of a pandemic, and physical health takes precedence over mental health needs. In this commentary, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of older Filipinos, who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19, and describe ways that healthcare workers can help alleviate the negative impact on their mental health to the extent possible within the limited resources available in the Philippines.",

The Philippine population density is 337 persons per square kilometer, although in the National Capital Region (NCR) alone in Luzon, the population density is a staggering 20,785 persons per square kilometer (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2016b). To put this in a perspective, the United States in comparison has a population density of about 90 people per square mile, and although density values vary from one city to another, most people live in cities with about 1600 people per square mile (Darryl, 2015) . Since the spread of COVID-19 is related to population density (Rocklov and Sjodin, 2020) , the high densities in the Philippines where people are in relatively close contact with each other in both personal and public spaces make social distancing difficult, facilitate virus spread more easily, and lead to higher rates of infection and death. In fact, within Southeast Asia, the Philippines has the highest number of coronavirus infection, with a mortality of 40% (Lema and Morales, 2020) .",

In the Philippines, older individuals comprise 7.5% of the total population equivalent to 7.5 million individuals (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2016a). Older Filipinos have a life expectancy of 71 years, which is slightly below the world average of 72 years (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2016a). Of the 7.5 million senior citizens in the country, only 30% receive social pension of P500 monthly (USD$10) and 40% receive no pension at all (Senate of the Philippines, 2019). In the context of a pandemic, the economic insecurity of older Filipinos heightens their vulnerabilities in terms of inability to access health care and pay for healthcare bills (Badana and Andel, 2018) . Older Filipinos who live in rural areas have more difficulties with access to healthcare services than those in urban settings. The high mortality rate of 40% from COVID-19 disproportionately affects the older Filipinos. As of April 15, 2020, there are 5453 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 349 deaths, of which 50.7% are aged 65 years and older (Department of Health, 2020). Overall, it is not just advanced age and medical comorbidities that make older Filipinos vulnerable to COVID-19, but poverty also plays a significant role in their high death rates.",

Majority of older Filipinos are deeply religious and have strong views of God's role in health and well-being. The strong faith and spirituality of older Filipinos serve as a strength and protective buffer to stress and suffering (Esteban, 2015) . Going to church regularly and attending church activities and gatherings are part of everyday life for older Filipinos. Churches in the Philippines are usually packed and overcrowded, with people sitting very close to each other in an enclosed space with decreased ventilation and poor air circulation. Mass in church involves singing and praying together, shaking hands when greeting each other with peace, receiving communion served by the priest or Eucharistic ministers, and drinking wine from a communal cup. All of these factors facilitate viral spread and transmission so being in a church and attending mass and other gatherings can be deadly for older Filipinos who are especially vulnerable to the disease.",

Becoming ill and needing treatment or hospitalization are extremely expensive, and medical costs are prohibitive for an average Filipino. While advances have been made to improve the fragmented healthcare system in the Philippines, continued inequities in health care significantly affect the poor. Currently, the hospitals in the country are overwhelmed and reaching maximum capacity, with severe shortage of beds, lack of ability to conduct COVID-19 testing, and inadequate supply of personal protective equipment.

All local government units are allowed to impose their own version of ECQ which involves travel restrictions (air, sea, and land), suspension of nonessential work, prohibition of mass gatherings, and closure of establishments except those providing or manufacturing basic necessities.

The restrictions from the community quarantine have also affected their mobility, including those who are self-sufficient, as they are prohibited from going out and barred from public places such as groceries and supermarkets.

Reduced physical activity and unhealthy behaviors are linked to increased morbidity and mortality in older individuals (Schrempft et al., 2019) . A significant challenge during prolonged lockdowns is to minimize the adverse effects of physical inactivity on older individuals. In addition, the lockdown has resulted in older Filipinos having very limited or no access to healthcare services since almost all outpatient clinics are closed because healthcare resources are mostly diverted to emergent care settings.

This is extremely difficult to cope with, as nobody should die alone, and families who are unable to see their loved ones before they die are at risk of complicated bereavement.

For physical and medical concerns, the public have access to the Department of Health hotline for free telemedicine consultation services for any medical conditions. For the older Filipinos who have anxieties about their physical health, local government units (LGUs) created a Barangay Health Emergency Response Team (BHERT) that serves as a triage unit prior to referral to a hospital or a designated COVID-19 medical center.

Communities have stepped up to help out as well, including buying basic commodities for the older neighbors. Social groups likewise volunteered to look in on older Filipinos who live alone to assess their needs and to ensure they are managing on their own. The national government also considers older Filipinos as a top priority in its social amelioration program of financial assistance during the pandemic together with programs initiated by other government officials and nongovernment organizations. Family caregivers have been helping to maintain social connections and minimize isolation and loneliness for older Filipinos in many ways. They assist with using digital methods and videoconferencing technologies to connect with friends and families and continue participating in respective organizations and communities through remote measures. For example, Himan Brown Senior program offers classes and social groups to 700 senior citizens (Finn, 2020) . Here, older individuals are taught how to best use digital resources to help maintain their social well-being. Family caregivers also assist their older loved ones access online services for spiritual comfort and support (Armitage and Nellums, 2020) . Older Filipinos also now attend holy mass on television, radio, or online because the schedules and frequency have increased several fold.",

While they constitute less than 8% of the total population, they comprise one-third of all cases and more than half of all deaths related to . This underscores what is widely known that older individuals are at a higher risk for COVID-19, with greater morbidity and mortality for this disease. Older Filipinos not only suffer physically but also emotionally, spiritually, and socially. In this unprecedented crisis that developing countries such as the Philippines are not sufficiently equipped to manage, collaborative efforts of the public and private sectors in conjunction with external aids from developed countries and the World Health Organization may help manage the care of our sick older patients adequately. Measures to strengthen the national healthcare infrastructure across the country are imperative in order to more effectively cope with future epidemics.",
