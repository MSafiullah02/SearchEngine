The expression level of an introduced gene in transgenic maize can be affected by many factors, including promoter activity, stability of mRNA, protein translation efficiency, protein stability in a particular cellular compartment, the chromosomal position of the integrated gene, and degree of gene silencing. This chapter will discuss how these factors should be considered and how to properly select expression-controlling elements when designing a gene construct for maize transformation.",

Figure 1 illustrates the steps that are involved in the process of plant gene expression. The first step of gene expression is the transcription of DNA to pre-mRNA, which is initiated by the regulatory element called the promoter. It is usually located at the 5\u2032 end of the gene, upstream of the transcription start site. The promoter contains various sequence elements that function in the recruitment of protein factors that facilitate transcription of the protein coding region of the gene. The most basic elements are the TATA box and CAAT box, the names of which are based on their nucleotide sequences. Transcription termination is determined by a terminator sequence, which is located downstream of the transcription termination site.\n",

To improve its activity in monocots, several modifications have been made, including the duplication of the enhancer region of the promoter (4). Another is the insertion of an intron found in various promoters of cereal plants. The intron is usually inserted between the 35S promoter and the initial codon of the transgene coding region.",

It has been generally thought that inclusion of an intron can improve efficiency of mRNA processing and increase the steady-state levels of mRNA (6). Even though the activity of unmodified CaMV 35S promoter is lower in monocots than in dicots, it has still been routinely used in maize transformation, when combined with an intron or some UTR sequences, for expressing screenable or selectable marker genes (7).",

As with the examples mentioned earlier, the inclusion of this intron greatly enhances the level of transgene expression. ProdiGene, a plant biotechnology company in Texas, has used the Ubi1 promoter to express avidin and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) genes in transgenic maize, both of which are used as diagnostic agents in molecular biology. In highly expressive transgenic lines, avidin constitutes over 2% of the aqueous protein extracted from dry maize seeds while the recombinant GUS protein can accumulate to 0.7% of total soluble proteins (9, 10). These two products from transgenic maize are now commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich. It has been estimated that the cost of producing avidin in transgenic maize is about only 10% of the cost of extraction from egg white.",

Cell culture confers the advantages of confinement of the transgene and its product. The short life cycle in cell culture allows for faster harvesting of the protein of interest. In addition to constitutive promoters, inducible promoters may be considered for this purpose. In rice cell culture, it has been demonstrated that the rice alpha-amylase promoter can drive high-level gene expression during sugar starvation (21). Recently, the same authors used this promoter combined with the signal peptide sequence of the amylase gene to express human serum albumin in rice cell culture (22). Upon sugar starvation, the highest yield of HSA that is secreted into the culture medium can reach 74 mg/L. This expression system may be adopted for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins in maize cell culture. To date, no research has been conducted on this subject.",

The presumed role of the 5\u2032 UTR is to influence the efficiency with which the bound ribosomal subunits migrate and recognize the translation start codon. A useful 5\u2032 UTR for transgene expression must be able to efficiently assemble ribosomes and present the start codon in an appropriate configuration.

The Toxin A gene is 7.5-kb long, encoding a 283-kD insecticidal protein. Achieving expression of Toxin A in plant cells is very difficult. With the attachment of the UTR sequences from the osmotin gene, expression levels of Toxin A protein in Arabidopsis plants were increased tenfold and the recovery rate of insect-resistant plants increased 12-fold. We chose the UTR sequences from tobacco osmotin because both osmotin mRNA and protein are very stable in plant cells. Computer modeling of its 3\u2032 UTR showed many stem-loop structures, which may effectively block degradation by RNAse (Liu et al. unpublished). The attachment of plant UTR sequences makes this prokaryotic gene behave more like a \u201cplant gene,\u201d so corresponding mRNA can be easily recognized by plant translation machinery. Homologs of osmotin exist in almost every monocot plant, including maize (38). It will be interesting to test if the UTR sequences from the maize osmotin homolog gene will have the same enhancing effect on gene expression in transgenic maize.",

Kozak has defined an optimal AUG context for vertebrates as GCC(A/G)CCAUGG (the start codon is underlined), named the Kozak consensus sequence. The most highly conserved position of the consensus is position \u22123 (the A of the AUG codon being +1) where 97% of vertebrate mRNAs have a purine. The \u22123 position appears to mediate the efficiency of translation initiation in vertebrate systems. Such a consensus sequence has also been found among plant genes: UAACAAUGGCU (40, 41). In position +4, the preference for a guanine is significantly high in plants (85%). The preference for G in position +4 (85%) and C at +5 (77%) in plants resembles the preference for A in position \u22123 in animals. Further compilation of sequences surrounding the AUG from 85 maize genes yields a consensus of (C/G)AUGGCG (42).

In contrast, plant genes in general tend to have a higher G+C content, with maize showing a strong preference for G+C-rich coding regions (45, 46). The A+T-rich sequence in bacterial genes may provide many putative motifs, which will function in plant cells as splice sites, polyadenylation signal sequences (40, 44, 47), and RNA destabilizing elements, such as ATTTA. The short motif of ATTTA was first found in animal cells, causing mRNA instability when present in the the 3\u2032 UTR of the transcript (48). This phenomenon has been confirmed in plant cells (49). Since all plant introns contain A/T-rich sequences (Goodall and Filipowicz, 1989), the presence of AT-rich elements, such as four or more consecutive A or T bases, may facilitate aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. With the presence of these deleterious sequence motifs, early constructs for Bt in plant cells produced highly unstable mRNA, resulting in very little translation of intact protein.",

Transgene expression can be influenced by the properties of the surrounding genomic DNA: the presence of flanking promoters, enhancing or silencing DNA elements, the copy number of integrated transgene, the chromatin structure or methylation status, etc. Today, there is no transformation technology that can effectively control where the transgene is integrated into the chromosomes of the targeted plants.

However, the use of different MARs or SARs, in combination with various promoters, can have different effects on gene expression in different systems (67). In transgenic maize, Sidorenko et al. (68) tested the effects of two MARs, one from the p1-rr gene and another from the adh1 gene, on the variability of transgene expression when combined with three different promoters. Their results showed that these two MARs have no effects on the reduction of variability of transgene expression; however, the Adh1-MAR did modify the spatial pattern of expression driven by one synthetic promoter. In another report, Torney et al. (69) tested two MARs from the adh1 gene, revealing new transgene expression patterns in roots and systemically induced variegation, but no effects on reduction of transgene expression variability among the individual transformants. So far, no effective methods have been developed in transgenic maize to eliminate the position effect that causes the variability of transgene expression.
