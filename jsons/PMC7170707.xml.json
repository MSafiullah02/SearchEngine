Of these, 1689 were completed episodes with 871 deaths and 818 discharged from critical care, giving a present mortality rate of 51.6% for those requiring critical care admission [5]. As a high consequence infectious disease unit, our institution was one of the first in the UK to treat confirmed COVID-19.

Assuming the incidence is the same across Europe (0.2/1,000) then this represents a total of around 100,000 tracheostomies per year. Approximately 70% of these are estimated to be performed by intensivists on intensive care units (ICU) using percutaneous dilatation techniques in the UK, which reflects a shift in practice since the introduction of this technique in 1985 [8].",

The classical radiological appearances are of patchy ground glass opacification and consolidation that may affect multiple lobes and progress to diffuse and dense consolidation. Published studies so far suggest in the early stages of disease there is patchy inflammatory infiltrate, oedema and proteinaceous exudate, with one autopsy study in a patient that died of COVID-19 showing bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates [9, 10]. The acute lung injury and resultant respiratory failure are responsible for the high levels of invasive mechanical ventilation required for COVID-19 patients.",

First, the prognosis of this novel disease is not yet fully understood but mortality rates for those requiring critical care are in the region of 50% [2, 5], which is considerably higher than non-COVID viral pneumonia (22.4%) [5]. This poses a risk of performing futile procedures if a tracheostomy is considered too early. Second, the duration of detectable viral load and correlation with transmission rates during aerosol generating procedures is not yet specifically known. Evidence from China showed infection rates of 3.8% amongst healthcare personnel treating COVID-19 patients [2] but at present, the infection rate related to tracheostomy insertion is unknown. There is no evidence to support a specific technique for tracheostomy insertion in terms of minimising risk of healthcare personnel exposure to airborne droplets.",

Decision-making around co-morbidity and critical care admission is guided by the clinical frailty score in patients older than 65 as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and individualised decisions are made for those aged under 65 [18].

A literature review of case series and reports from the SARS outbreak identified 23 tracheostomies performed where no healthcare personnel became infected. It was noted that in all cases PAPRs were used by the operating team [32]. Therefore, it appears that this enhanced level of PPE represents the safest possible level of protection for staff and should be mandatory when performing tracheostomy.

We recommend overinflating cuff to ensure no leak throughout the procedure (as described in ST).We advise clamping ETT and pausing ventilation (at end-expiration) during these critical steps that are associated with increased risk of aerosol generation: changing catheter mount, repositioning ETT cuff to the level of the vocal cords, and removal of large rhino dilator.Tracheal puncture site should be covered with a swab throughout the procedure to reduce aerosol spread.",

Within the ORL-HNS department, current levels of expertise and experience for both percutaneous and surgical techniques were established for both consultants and senior trainees to help identify appropriate team leaders and ensure adequate skill levels. Cadaveric refresher training was provided over a 1-day session to 25 personnel from the ORL-HNS department. The team had an opportunity to practice the percutaneous technique in line with our action cards twice each. During this day, we were also able to create an instructional video to support learning and ensure our teams are well rehearsed in the COVID-19 percutaneous technique.

The provision for nursing and rehabilitation of patients once discharged from the ICU will also need to be considered. The cohorting of patients recovering from COVID-19 with tracheostomies onwards with appropriately trained nursing staff is desirable.
