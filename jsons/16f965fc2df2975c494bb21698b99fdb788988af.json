An information asymmetry exists when one party has more information about a particular state than another party. For example, a used car seller has more information about the quality of the car being sold than a potential used car buyer. In medical insurance, the information asymmetry is between the insured party and the insurance company on the state of the insured party's health. Similarly, the information asymmetry during the SARS crisis is between the people who are healthy and those that are sick.",

Further revelation of the disease appeared on February 11, 2003 , when Guangdong authorities reported that between November 16, 2002, and February 9, 2003 , five out of 305 people that contracted atypical pneumonia in the province died. On February 22, 2003, a 64-year-old medical doctor from Guangdong province was admitted to a Hong Kong hospital after falling ill while staying at the Metropole Hotel. He died on March 4, but not before infecting guests at the hotel, who then went on and transmitted the disease in Canada, Vietnam, and Singapore. On March 12, 2003 , the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert following the spread of the disease and three days later declared SARS a \"worldwide health threat.\"",

            "text": "Are such behaviors during the SARS epidemic irrational? No, it is actually perfectly rational from an economics viewpoint. SARS, apart from being a medical issue, is an asymmetric information problem. The problem of asymmetric information can be traced to the Nobel Prize-winning article by George Akerlof in 1970 on the \"lemons\" problem in markets where information asymmetry exists between the sellers and buyers of a certain product. 6 In a used car market, for example, buyers have less information than sellers about the quality of the cars being sold and, hence, are willing to pay only an average price for it. In the presence of asymmetric information, good cars and bad cars are lumped together and sold at the same price. This creates an adverse selection problem because the average price offered is likely to be more attractive to sellers of bad cars than to sellers of good cars. Consequently, more bad cars (lemons) will be offered for sale than good cars.",

            "text": "Rational car buyers would anticipate this adverse selection problem and expect that at any given price, they are more likely to get a lemon than a good car. The buyers, therefore, would be less willing to pay and demand a deep discount on the car. Sellers of a good car would eventually withdraw from the market because not only can are likely to be many times higher. For example, because of the problem of asymmetric information, the Richmond Times-Dispatch (April 17, 2003) reported in Toronto that: \"The mall was quiet not because of shoppers who have SARS, but because people are so afraid of catching it. Business in Toronto's various Chinese neighborhoods has plummeted by up to 70 percent.\" 7 America's top cancer researchers canceled their annual meeting in Toronto because of the fear that they might contract the disease and spread the virus to sick people when they returned. SARS is also estimated to have scared away one-fifth of Toronto's billion-dollar film, television, and commercial business and cost the film industry CAD $163 million. 8 The asymmetric information problems also caused people to cancel their travel plans. Thus, tourism-related businesses suffered during the SARS epidemic. Air Canada, for example, is estimated to have shed CAD $5 million a day during the SARS outbreak in Toronto. 9 Cathay Pacific Airways reported a loss of HK $1.241 billion in 2003 as the SARS epidemic emptied planes and forced the airline to cut more than half its flights. 10 The Beijing Capital International Airport, moreover, reported a 22.5% drop in 2003 net profit. 11 According to Chinese authorities, the estimated losses in Beijing's tourism sector ranged from U.S. $1.9 billion to U.S. $4.8 billion due to the outbreak of SARS. 12 Hong Kong authorities estimated that losses in the retail sector, airlines, hotels, and restaurant industries ranged from HK $33 billion to HK $46 billion. 13 he not receive the true value for his car, but he cannot even get an average value for it. Unless the asymmetric information problem is resolved, the above process may lead to a complete breakdown of the market, because the bad cars will eventually drive out the good cars in the same way bad money drives out the good.",

Healthy individuals, however, simply cannot distinguish if the other person that they come into contact with in public has or does not have SARS during the epidemic. Also, in comparison to the government and public health authorities, the general public is less informed because of the lack of access to aggregate-wide information about the incidence as well as the severity of the epidemic. Information asymmetry can also arise when the authorities have advance knowledge on the extent of the crisis or when there are substantial delays in the dissemination of information to the public. Furthermore, the information asymmetry between the general public and the authorities is even more acute when the information provided by the authorities is not credible.

A good example of the isolation measures adopted during the SARS epidemic is in the case of Singapore, where anyone suspected of having SARS was immediately quarantined for ten days. The suspected person then had to answer twice-daily telephone calls, which checked on his/her condition. Electronic wrist tags were used to closely monitor individuals who did not answer the twice-daily telephone calls. The penalty for violating a quarantine order was a heavy fine and, in certain instances, could include a jail term. Singapore, in addition, had effectively used contact tracing to track those who had come into contact with the infected persons. This is an important process to ensure that those who were infected or could be potential carriers of the disease were quickly attended to and isolated from the rest of the population.",

Subsequently, the company was able to reopen in time for business on January 3, but no one called. This happened because of the information asymmetry that arises during the crisis.

Selfdenial and any attempts to cover up the crisis would only further contribute and aggravate the asymmetric information problems.

The whole incident affected USAir's credibility, created mistrusts, and further contributed to the information asymmetry problem about the safety of USAir's planes. USAir's debacle in this case is attributable to its failure to provide accurate, timely, and transparent \"information disclosure\" to the public. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson overcame the asymmetric information problem about the quality and safety of its products during the 1983 cyanide-laced Tylenol crisis by being honest in its communication. The firm also acted quickly to separate the bad products from the rest of the good products by repurchasing millions of capsules from stores and customers and redesigning its packaging to enhance safety and protection. 23 Through its concerted efforts to \"separate the good from the bad\" and to provide accurate \"information disclosures\" to the public, Johnson & Johnson was able to quickly re-establish confidence and trust in its brand and, hence, preserve its reputation successfully.",

We couldn't seem to impress upon people that we are not part of the United Way of America. It tarnished the image. We expect that we'll be dealing with it a few more years.\" 20 The United Way crisis shows that the severity and persistence of asymmetric information problems are often not well understood and, hence, inadequately resolved during a crisis.",

They also did not manage to fully restore their \"reputation and trust\" among the public because the people were still concerned about where their donations were going. To establish confidence and trust, the local United Way offices should have credibly \"signaled\" to the public by committing the donated funds to a trust account that is managed by an independent reputable third party and earmarked to be used for charitable purposes only. Another credible signal would be to get a high-profile and reputable individual to openly donate to the charitable organization. Overall, the \"certification\" provided by independent and credible third parties would have been important in assuring the public on the proper usage of donated funds and, therefore, in building \"reputation and trust.\"",

Also, the need to deal with asymmetric information problems is applicable to all the four different and distinct stages of a business crisis: prodromal, acute, chronic, and crisis resolution. 21 During the prodromal crisis stage, a firm should not only focus on crisis prevention plans. Even the best preventive plans may not help, because a crisis can develop suddenly and the circumstances surrounding the crisis may be beyond the control of the organization and driven by the external environment. At this stage, firms should also prepare to manage a potential crisis. Proactive planning requires a firm to lay the foundation to deal with potential asymmetric information problems that arise during a crisis. As pointed out in the previous section, reputation is an important tool in mitigating asymmetric information problems during a crisis. However, a good reputation takes tion with the media, government regulators, the financial community, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and employees to prevent any misperception or misinterpretation of information.",

The SARS epidemic provides a good illustration of the asymmetric information problems that typically prevail during a crisis and how one can deal with it. Asymmetric information problems also arose during the September 11 incidents, but the effects tended to be less significant. The information asymmetry costs associated with the SARS epidemic in comparison are substantial, but limited by the fact that SARS affected mostly Canada and the Asia-Pacific region. In the event of a worldwide avian flu pandemic, however, the asymmetric information problems associated with it are likely to be more severe, and the potential costs are probably many times higher if asymmetric information problems during the crisis are not adequately resolved.",

In addition, the CEO of the organization can publicly consume the products himself/herself to \"signal\" to the public that its products are safe. At this stage, warranties or guarantees can also serve, to a certain extent, as a form of assurance to individuals about the product quality.",

For example, the SARS epidemic was an exceptional crisis for hotels in Singapore even as they advanced to near normalcy. Even after Singapore was declared SARS-free by WHO and travel warnings were downgraded, worries persisted that the virus might return. In response, the hotels in Singapore redefined their business strategies and devised promotional packages that target the local residents to holiday in their own country. 24 Some hotels also engaged in advertising campaigns and collaborated with airlines, travel agencies, and the Singapore Tourism Board in assorted promotional campaigns to attract more tourists. 25 Through these efforts, the hotels in Singapore were able to reassure customers, build confidence, and fully restore a sense of normalcy.",
