These proteins were observed in von Ebner's glands by 32 P-GTP overlay. mRNA isolated from von Ebner's glands, the pancreas, parotid glands, and liver was subjected to reverse transcription PCR and probed with primers and nested primers for Rab3D and Rab3B. Rab3D was found in all three exocrine glands and the liver, while Rab3B was found in the liver. Utilizing immunofluorescence histochemistry, Rab3D was localized to hepatocytes of the liver and to secretory granules of the exocrine glands, and Rab3B to liver and pancreatic islets. Isoproterenol evoked decreases in \u03b1-amylaseand Rab3D-labelled parotid secretory granules, and pilocarpine stimulated decreases in secretory granules labelled for lingual lipase and Rab3D from von Ebner's glands, and amylase and Rab3D from pancreas. Neither secretagogue affected Rab3B in pancreatic islets. These observed parallel decreases in response to \u03b2-adrenergic (parotid) or cholinergic (von Ebner's and pancreas) secretagogues indicate that the function of Rab3D in exocytosis in these exocrine organs is similar and that the type of secretagogue does not determine the function.",

            "text": "Small GTP-binding proteins (SGPs) have been implicated as important factors in the regulation of secretion and vesicular transport. Mammalian SGPs named Rab are GTPases of M r <30 kDa that play a role in secretory and endocytic pathways. More than 40 Rabs involved in the targeting and fusion of transport vesicles with acceptor membranes have been found in a variety of tissues and species. Newly synthesized proteins that are destined for secretion are stored in secretory granules. Rab3 proteins are important in the fusion of secretory granule membranes with cell membranes prior to exocytosis, and thus are associated with the final steps of exocytosis (see reviews by Novick & Zerial 1997 , Martinez & Goud 1998 , Schimm\u00f6ller et al. 1998 ). There are four Rab3 isoforms (see review by Fischer von Mollard et al. 1994b) . Rab3A is expressed mainly in neurons and neuroendocrine cells localized on synaptic vesicles (Matteoli et al. 1991) and also on adrenal chromaffin granules (Darchen et al. 1995) . Rab3C is associated with the brain and colocalizes with Rab3A on synaptic vesicles (Fischer von Mollard et al. 1994a ). Rab3B is found in epithelial-derived tissue, both cultured and native, i.e. liver, small intestine, colon, and distal nephron (Weber et al. 1994) . It also is found in pancreatic islets (Regazzi et al. 1996) . Rab3D has been found in adipocytes, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, lung (Baldini et al. 1992) , and in secretory granules in cells that undergo exocytosis, namely, exocrine pancreas, acinar cells of lacrimal glands, apical granules of Paneth cells of the intestine (Ohnishi et al. 1996) , parotid (Ohnishi et al. 1996 , Raffaniello et al. 1999 , stomach chief cells (Ohnishi et al. 1996 , Raffaniello et al. 1996 , and mast cells (Roa et al. 1997 , Tuvim et al. 1999 ).",

The von Ebner's glands, also known as lingual serous glands, are minor salivary glands located in the tongue beneath the vallate and folate papillae (Hand 1970) . These glands secrete two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and \u03b1amylase (Field & Hand 1987 , Field et al. 1989 . Lingual lipase digests triacylglycerols at the acid pH of the stomach, producing diacyl-and monoacyl-glycerols and fatty acids. (Field & Scow 1983) . Secretion of lingual lipase and amylase from rat von Ebner's glands is regulated principally by cholinergic stimulation similar to the pancreas (Field & Hand 1987) , but in the parotid gland, protein secretion is regulated primarily by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation (Putney 1986) . This difference in regulation of secretion makes the comparison of the role of Rab3 isoforms in different exocrine glands of great interest. In addition, although the Rab3B isoform was found in the liver, no studies have been done on Rab3D in the liver.",

Micro Poly (A) pure mRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) was used to isolate mRNA from rat von Ebner's gland, parotid, and pancreas. Rigorous precautions were taken to maintain an RNAse-free environment. Deionized, distilled water, used for the preparation of all solutions, was treated with diethylpyrocarbonate and autoclaved. Seven or eight week old male rats, 269-295 g, were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and euthanized by exsanguination.

In previous studies utilizing rtPCR, Western blots, and immunocytochemistry, Rab3D was found in the rat parotid (Ohnishi et al. 1996 , Raffaniello et al. 1999 ) and the rat pancreas (Ohnishi et al. 1996) . Rab3D was also found in insulin secreting cells (Iezzi et al. 1999) . In our experiments, the immunofluorescent response to Rab3D in the exocrine pancreas (Figure 3b ) overwhelmed any visualization of islet response to Rab3D. Rab3B, as expected, was found in pancreatic islets (Regazzi et al. 1996) and the liver (Weber et al. 1994) . Islets were readily visible in response to Rab3B, since Rab3B is not found in the exocrine pancreas. The current studies are the first to show the presence of Rab3D in von Ebner's glands and the liver. The fluorescence seen in the liver due to Rab3D was much weaker than Rab3B and weaker than amylase. It was considered that this signal might be due to mast cells which have been shown to contain Rab3D (Roa et al. 1997 , Tuvim et al. 1999 . Although mast cells are present in the liver in rat and humans in diseased states, very few mast cells are found in normal tissue (Rioux et al. 1996 , Armbrust et al. 1997 ). In addition, when serial sections of the liver were stained for mast cells, it was ascertained that there were far too few mast cells to account for the positive effect of Rab3D. It is also possible that the fluorescent response to Rab3D might be an artifact, but a band indicating the presence of Rab3D mRNA was seen in the rtPCR experiments in the liver, reinforcing the observation that Rab3D is found in liver.",
