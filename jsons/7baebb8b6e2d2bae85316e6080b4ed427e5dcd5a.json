Although this equation is nonlinear and it contains time-dependent coefficients, it can be solved in closed form, yielding an expression for N(t) that depends on a function \u03b1(t). For the particular case that \u03b1(t) is constant, this expression reduces to the well-known logistic formula, giving rise to a sigmoidal curve suitable for modelling usual epidemics. However, for the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the long series of available data shows that the use of this simple formula for predictions underestimates N(t); thus, the logistic formula only provides a lower bound of N(t). After experimenting with more than 50 different forms of \u03b1(t), we introduce two novel models that will be referred to as \"rational\" and \"birational\". The parameters specifying these models (as well as those of the logistic model), are determined from the available data using an errorminimizing algorithm. The analysis of the applicability of the above models to the cases of China and South Korea suggest that they yield more accurate predictions, and importantly that they may provide an upper bound of the actual N(t).

It is the third coronavirus to appear in the human population in the past two decades, following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, and the Middle East syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012. China responded quickly to this outbreak by informing the World Health Organization. Also, after Chinese scientists identified the sequence of the causative virus [1] , this information was immediately shared with the international community. Furthermore, China took effective measures for the containment of the spread of this outbreak. The 2019-nCoV is less pathogenic than the earlier two coronaviruses [2] . For example, in the first case of pneumonia caused by this virus reported in USA, a 35-years-old, healthy, individual (who had travelled in Wuhan) presented in a hospital four days after he experienced dry cough and low grade fever; he proceeded to develop pneumonia 5 days later, but quickly recovered [3] . This is the typical disease course for young persons; however, the 2019-nCoV has a significant mortality rate for elderly persons and for those with a variety of underlying medical conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, this virus is highly contagious. As a result of these facts, and the lack of appropriate early international measures for the suppression of its spread, it has now caused a pandemic. This pandemic represents the most serious global public health threat since the devastating 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Justifiably, several countries have adopted draconian measures to combat this threat. The scientific community, in addition to its accelerated efforts to develop an effective treatment and a vaccination, is also playing an important role in advising policy makers of possible non-pharmacological approaches to limit the catastrophic impact of the pandemic. For example, two possible strategies, called mitigation and suppression, are thoroughly discussed in the important paper [4] ; in the early stages of the pandemic, UK was following mitigation, but after the publication of this report, is now following suppression.",

These models can be used for predicting several features of the epidemic, such as the time that a plateau will be reached, as well as the total number of individuals reported to be infected at that time. Here, the plateau is defined as the time when the rate of change of the people reported to be infected is 5% of the maximum rate of infection. We introduce two novel models, called \"rational\" and \"birational\"; the important advantage of these models is that they provide more accurate predictions for the characteristics of the plateau. Also, importantly, the birational model may provide an upper bound of N(t), and hence it is preferable to the rational one. However, the rational model can be constructed sooner than the birational one: the input needed for the rational model is data until around the time, T, when the maximum rate of infection occurs (the corresponding point on the curve describing N(t) is known as the inflection point). On the other hand, the birational model requires data for several more additional days. Assuming that the number of individuals reported to be infected is a timeinvariant percentage of the actual number of infected persons, the model discussed here should be useful for long-term planning strategy and for reassuring the public.",

Italy, Spain, and France passed the inflection point several days ago, and UK has now also passed this point. The total reported cases of the above countries (as well as of Greece where the situation is better and USA where it is worse) are shown in figure 1. Estimated rates of change (new reported cases) for Italy, Spain, France, and UK are plotted in figure 2. These graphs show that in all countries, except Greece, the growth of the epidemics is similar for the first approximately 10 days after the day that the number of infected persons reached 500. However, following this period, the behaviour of the epidemics is different, presumably reflecting the type of measures and the time that these measures were implemented, in each country. According to our definition, China reached the plateau around March 2, 2020 and South Korea around April 13, 2020.",

In this pioneering paper the population is divided into Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered (removed) sub-populations. Then, specific ordinary differential equations are formulated specifying the time evolution of the functions representing these populations. The above work was certainly ahead of its time. It was rediscovered in the 1980s, and since then, it has provided the basis for a variety of deterministic models, known as SIR models. In particular, rigorous mathematical results for such models are derived in [6] . The extension of SIR to models involving partial differential equations is presented in [7] . Statistical models have also been highly effective for modelling aspects of epidemics.",

After experimenting with more than 50 different forms of \u03b1(t), we have obtained affirmative answers to both of the above questions. We have introduced two novel models which will be referred to as rational and birational.

Another notable example of the appearance of a constant coefficients Riccati equation in the mathematical modelling of infectious processes, can be found in the paper of Anderson and May [9] ; this work describes the dynamic interaction of parasites with their host-environment. In this paper, whose impact in the field of mathematical biology was far reaching [10] , a Riccati equation is formulated that involves a single constant parameter.

The simplex changes iteratively by reflection, expansion, and contraction steps, until it finds the model parameters that minimize the given likelihood function. The constrained variation of the simplex algorithm [12, 13] available in MATLAB \u00ae was used for all tested models; an L1-norm was employed in the likelihood function to improve robustness [14] . The simplex algorithm is particularly effective for cases where the gradient of the likelihood functions is not easy to calculate. Random parameter initializations were used to avoid local minima. The simplex algorithm was chosen because it performed better than the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting algorithms evaluated in this work, namely the Levenberg-Marquardt [15] and the trust-region-reflective [16] algorithms.",

In particular, it made it possible to construct the rational and birational models, which at least for the epidemics of China and South Korea provide, respectively, were able to provide more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the birational model provided an upper bound of the actual N(t). This suggests that the methodology introduced in our work may be used for providing bounds of important aspects of the current pandemic. For example, it can provide reasonable estimates for the time that the plateau will be reached as well as the number of persons that will be reported to be infected at that time.",

            "text": "The approach presented here has several novel and useful features: (i) For the case that an infection that has been stabilized, any of the three models analyzed here can be used for the evolution of the cumulative number of persons reported to be infected, via a simple analytical expression. This expression can be used for a variety of purposes. (ii) More importantly, the rational and birational models can be used for predictive purposes, providing accurate estimates for the characteristics of the plateau. (iii) Our approach has the capacity for increasing continuously the accuracy of the predictions: as soon as the epidemic in a given country passes the time T, the rational model can be used; furthermore, when the sigmoidal part of the curve is approached, the rational model can be supplemented with the birational model (a simple criterion of checking whether the birational model can be used is given in section 2.1). Also, as more data become available, the parameters of the rational and of the birational models can be re-evaluated; this will yield better predictions. (iv) The Riccati equation (1) together with the flexibility of the arbitrariness of \u03b1(t), offer the possibility of deciphering basic physiological mechanisms dictating the evolution of N(t). In particular, following the transient stage of the epidemic, it may be envisioned that \u03b1(t) becomes a function of N instead of a function of t. By plotting \u03b1 in terms of N is possible to scrutinize a posteriori their relationship: we find that after t approximately equal to T-7 the relation between the relation between \u03b1 and N/500 is, remarkably, linear, see figure 8. How can the apparent success of the simple approached followed in our work can be explained? Presumably, the constant Nf defining equation (1), the constant of integration \u03b2 entering the associated solution, and the constant parameters specifying the function \u03b1(t), must capture the essence of the underlying time-evolution process. This suggests that the cumulative effects of a variety of different mechanisms express themselves via the few parameters entering in the explicit solution formulas (3), (10) and (11). In this connection, it is worth recalling that the single parameter characterizing the Riccati equation of the celebrated Anderson-May model mentioned earlier, represents the cumulative effect of different biological mechanisms: it is shown in [9] that this constant can be expressed in terms of the population size parameter H, the mortality rate of uninfected hosts parameter b, the mortality rate of infected hosts parameter \u03b1 + b, and the rate at which infected hosts recover and become susceptible parameter \u03b3.",

Indeed, the explicit formulas (3), (10) and (11) used in this work can be thought of as 'algorithms', where given t, they predict N; these algorithms are characterized by several parameters, which are fixed by the 'knowledge' of the data. Thus, the more data are available, the better this algorithm 'learns' how to make accurate predictions. Hence, choosing these parameters by requiring that the analytical solution matches the data curve, is consistent with the approach of machine learning. This point is further explored in [N. Dikaios, A. S. Fokas, and G. A. Kastis, Deep Learning for Predicting Aspects of the COVAD-19 Pandemic, in preparation].",

The three models were fitted with data up to April 26, 2020, which corresponds respectively to T+26, T+24, and T+22. For the epidemic of Italy, the logistic model predicts a plateau on May 5, 2020 (day 59 after the day that 500 cases were reported) with 189,232 reported individuals; the rational model predicts a plateau on June 8, 2020(day 102) with 227,961 reported individuals; and the birational model predicts a plateau on June 14, 2020 (day 108) with 244,199 reported individuals. Clearly, again, the logistic model underestimates the actual plateau day and the number of cases infected, since on April 26, 2020 (last day of acquired data for this study) the number of infected cases for Italy had reached 195,351. For the epidemic of Spain, the logistic model predicts a plateau on April 30, 2020 (day 53 after the day that 500 cases were reported) with 199,877 reported individuals; the rational model predicts a plateau on May 19, 2020 (day 72) with 225,267 reported individuals; and the birational model predicts a plateau on May 18, 2020 (day 71) with 226,424 reported individuals. Again, the logistic model underestimates the actual plateau day and number of cases infected, since on April 26, 2020 the number of infected cases for Spain had reached 207,634. For the epidemic of France, the logistic model predicts a plateau on May 4, 2020 (day 59 the day that 500 cases were reported) with 122,834 reported individuals; the rational model predicts a plateau on May 20, 2020 (day 75) with 138,151 reported individuals; and the birational model predicts a plateau on May 17, 2020 (day 72) with 143,428 reported individuals. Again, the logistic model underestimates the actual plateau day and number of cases infected, since on April 26, 2020, the number of infected cases for France had reached 124,114.",
