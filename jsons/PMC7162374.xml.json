An immune host encountering a virus for a second time usually resists any disease associated with re\u2010infection, as the expanded pools of virus\u2010specific memory B and T cells effectively restrict the replication of the pathogen. Individuals exposed to a virus for the first time, however, can vary dramatically in their symptoms and viral load. This variation is sometimes attributed to the initial viral dose or to the genetics or physiological state of the host, but we suggest here that another major factor leading to this variation is the contribution of the pools of memory cells specific to previously encountered and sometimes completely unrelated pathogens.",

The recognition of this peptide/MHC complex is mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR), which is a heterodimeric structure comprised of an \u03b1 and \u03b2 chain (Davis et al., 1998). Within each chain of the TCR are three variable sites, known as complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (van der Merwe and Davis, 2003), which protrude as loops from the TCR and directly contact sites on the peptide and the MHC molecule (Stewart\u2010Jones et al., 2003).",

Thus, the breadth of the T cell repertoire would not be sufficient unless T cells had the capacity to recognize more than one antigen. Otherwise, non\u2010immunogenic pathogens would easily evolve to escape detection by T cells. T cells are, however, cross\u2010reactive against numerous epitopes, and a mathematical modelling analysis predicted that a single TCR may be able to interact with over one million different peptides (Mason, 1998). The CDR3 loops of the TCR undergo significant conformational changes in order to accommodate the 3\u2010dimensional structure of the peptide\u2010MHC surface (Garcia et al., 1998; Reiser et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2002; Kjer\u2010Nielsen et al., 2003). This flexibility imparted to the TCR may allow a single TCR to be promiscuous in the recognition of peptides and thereby be inherently cross\u2010reactive. This cross\u2010reactive nature of T cells may allow memory CD8 T cells generated by prior viral infections to play roles in subsequent infections with unrelated viruses.",

An expected form of cross\u2010reactivity would be against evolutionarily conserved sequences between very closely related viruses, where epitopes would either be identical or differ only slightly. Such cross\u2010reactivity has been observed in T cell responses between influenza virus A subtypes (Haanen et al., 1999; Belz et al., 2001), members of the Old World arenavirus family (Oldstone et al., 2001), the four serotypes of dengue virus (Spaulding et al., 1999; Mongkolsapaya et al., 2003), very closely related hantaviruses (including Hantaan and Seoul) (Van Epps et al., 1999), and serotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV\u2010Indiana and New Jersey) (Puddington et al., 1986; Yewdell et al., 1986). Cross\u2010reactivity does not have to be between homologous or highly conserved sequences, however. While mapping immunodominant epitopes cross\u2010reactivity was occasionally found between two different and non\u2010homologous sequences on the same protein or between different proteins derived from the same virus. Such cross\u2010reactivity has been reported for T cells specific for peptides derived from influenza virus (Kuwano et al., 1991; Anderson et al., 1992; Haanen et al., 1999), polyoma virus (Wilson et al., 1999), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Kulkarni et al., 1993).",

This is an important observation relating to heterologous immunity, as many pathogens are controlled by IFN\u2010\u03b3. Some work has suggested that cytokines alone may stimulate memory cells to produce IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Berg et al., 2002; Kambayashi et al., 2003). However, the mechanisms mediating this early production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 have not been satisfactorily elucidated, as viral and bacterial pathogens may encode numerous foreign epitopes having the capacity to trigger the TCR at low affinity, and the role of T cell cross\u2010reactivity in these studies was not excluded. Results from our laboratory highlight the difficulties in distinguishing between TCR\u2010dependent and TCR\u2010independent stimulations. LCMV\u2010immune CD8 T cells produced IFN\u2010\u03b3 3 days after vaccinia virus (VV) infection (Chen et al., 2001). It could be argued that this was a non\u2010specific phenomenon because T cells of multiple specificities were activated. However, IFN\u2010\u03b3 was made by higher proportions of some LCMV epitope\u2010specific T cells than other epitope\u2010specific populations. This diversity in the proportions of epitope\u2010specific populations producing IFN\u2010\u03b3 suggested a level of selectivity that may be supported by the recent identification of some cross\u2010reactive epitopes between VV and LCMV (Welsh et al., 2004). Regardless of the mechanism for IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, the IFN\u2010\u03b3 inhibited the replication of VV.",

This has been shown in transgenic and non\u2010transgenic systems. Memory TCR\u2010transgenic CD8 T cells specific for OVA and the LCMV\u2010epitope GP33 migrate to the lung following intranasal infection with the unrelated influenza virus and RSV, respectively (Topham et al., 2001; Ostler et al., 2003). Migration of MHC\u2010tetramer\u2010defined memory T cell populations to peripheral sites of infection was also shown in studies demonstrating that memory CD8 T cells specific to influenza virus, LCMV, murine \u03b3 herpes virus 68, and Sendai virus were recruited into the lung following infection with heterologous viruses (Topham et al., 2001; Ely et al., 2003; Ostler et al., 2003). The mechanism mediating the recruitment of memory CD8 T cells to the lung following intranasal infection is not yet fully defined but would be consistent with a generalized migration to an inflammatory site driven by the production of chemokines (Stephens et al., 2002), as this influx of T cells is independent of cell division (Ely et al., 2003; Ostler et al., 2003). The generalized recruitment of virus\u2010specific CD8 T cells to the site of infection may be a normal characteristic of an inflammatory response that allows for efficient effector function in the periphery.",

            "text": "Memory CD8 T cells generated by prior viral infections will be reactivated upon re\u2010challenge with the originally encountered virus and will contribute to the overall immunity against the second infection. Normally the presence of neutralizing antibody will mute a secondary T cell response by restricting viral replication and antigen presentation to T cells, but in the absence of neutralizing antibody sufficient antigen is expressed to induce an anamnestic T cell response. A well documented example is in the influenza system, where antigenic shift produces subtypes of influenza A virus that are not recognized by neutralizing antibodies generated by previous infections with different influenza A subtypes (Wright and Webster, 2001). In the absence of those protective antibodies, prior infection with one influenza subtype generally still provides substantial protection against a challenge with a different subtype. This is referred to as heterosubtypic immunity (Schulman and Kilbourne, 1965). The protection afforded against subsequent infections with heterologous influenza virus subtypes has been attributed, in some studies, to the massive cross\u2010reactive CD8 T cell response at the site of infection following rechallenge (Yewdell et al., 1985; Townsend et al., 1986; Belz et al., 2001). Similar types of responses have been seen between the New Jersey and Indiana strains of VSV, which do not share neutralizing antibody epitopes but have cross\u2010reactive T cell epitopes that differ in only two amino acids (Puddington et al., 1986; Yewdell et al., 1986). All of these systems indicate that if virus replication is not restricted by neutralizing antibody, the response of epitope\u2010stimulated T cells can be quite profound, and this feature could contribute to dramatic T cell responses under conditions of heterologous immunity.",

To characterize the response of virus\u2010specific memory CD8 T cells against subsequent infections with heterologous but cross\u2010reactive viruses, the proliferation of these memory cells was examined after a viral challenge using an adoptive transfer model that allows the division of CD8 T cells to be directly quantified (Lyons and Parish, 1994). Splenocytes from LCMV\u2010immune mice were labelled with a fluorescent dye, CFSE, which divides equally between daughter cells during division and then transferred into a naive host. Infection of a recipient with the homologous virus, LCMV, induced substantial division and accumulation of the donor CD8 T cells (Fig. 2), with virtually all detectable T cells specific for LCMV undergoing at least seven divisions, the limit of detection with CFSE (Kim et al., 2002). In contrast, treatment of recipient mice with poly (I:C) induced no increase in cell number of donor cells and stimulated only limited cell division, again demonstrating the requirement for TCR engagement for sustained proliferation. In this transfer model, infection with the heterologous but cross\u2010reactive viruses PV and VV stimulated significant proliferation of a subset of the donor cells (Fig. 2), which were presumably those cross\u2010reactive between the viruses. These findings show that cross\u2010reactivity results in the proliferation of selected populations of virus\u2010specific memory CD8 T cells and raises the question of what effect these expanded populations of memory T cells will have on the response against the current infection.",

In agreement, mice previously infected with a wild\u2010type strain of LCMV and then challenged with variant strains of LCMV that encode altered T cell epitopes preferentially generated CD8 T cells that were specific for the epitope encoded for by the previously encountered wild\u2010type virus (Klenerman and Zinkernagel, 1998). However, the recall T cell responses generated by secondary infection with the LCMV\u2010variants did not efficiently recognize the variant epitopes encoded for by the second virus and resulted in the impaired clearance of the variant viruses. This impairment in immunity during sequential infections suggests that in some instances memory T cells generated by prior infections can have detrimental consequences for a host's defence against pathogens.",

Multiple parameters, including the efficiency of peptide processing and presentation, the affinity of the peptide for the presenting MHC molecule, the quantity of MHC\u2010peptide complexes, the available TCR repertoire, and competition between T cells (immunodomination) are thought to contribute to these immunodominance profiles (Yewdell and Bennink, 1999).",

Cross\u2010reactive T cells are not always readily apparent following an infection with a single virus because the frequencies of cross\u2010reactive cells may be very low. Cross\u2010reactivity is more easily detectable following multiple infections, because it is those cross\u2010reactive T cells that are selectively amplified after infection (Selin et al., 1994;Haanen et al., 1999). The expansion of cross\u2010reactive CD8 T cell responses by sequential infection with natural variants of influenza virus has been elegantly demonstrated (Haanen et al., 1999). The two influenza variants differ by two amino acid residues in the dominant epitope NP366. Sequential infection with the two influenza variants preferentially stimulated the expansion of the cross\u2010reactive CD8 T cells that represent only a minor population during infection with a single variant.

For example, LCMV\u2010immune, PV\u2010immune and MCMV\u2010immune mice were afforded a significant level of protection against challenge with VV (greater than a 100\u2010fold decrease in titres relative to na\u00efve mice by four days post infection). Both CD4 and CD8 T cells from LCMV\u2010immune mice were necessary to provide protection against PV and VV, and immunity against VV was mediated at least in part by the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3. Of note is that this immunity was not reciprocal, as VV\u2010immune mice were not protected against infection with any of the heterologous viruses. This lack of reciprocity for heterologous immunity in VV\u2010immune mice correlated with the functional activity of T cells, as VV\u2010specific memory T cells were not stimulated by LCMV infection to proliferate or to be cytolytic (Selin et al., 1994; Kim et al., 2002).",

LCMV\u2010immune mice were protected against a lethal dose of VV delivered intranasally, with significant reductions in VV titres in the lung compared to na\u00efve mice. Mice previously infected with MCMV or influenza also were protected against intranasal challenge with VV. Following VV challenge of mice that were previously infected with either LCMV or influenza, a shift in cytokine production towards a Th1 phenotype (such as IFN\u2010\u03b3 production) was observed in the lungs 3 days after infection in comparison to the cytokines produced in VV\u2010infected na\u00efve mice. Heterologous immunity in the lung was not always protective, however, as clearance of LCMV and MCMV was impaired in influenza\u2010immune mice, and a history of an LCMV infection impaired the ability of mice to clear RSV from the lung following an intranasal inoculation (Ostler et al., 2003). The mechanisms of diminished protective immunity in mice previously infected with heterologous virus are uncertain and may correlate with altered cytokine profiles. Alternatively, the reduced levels of protection may be attributed to the stimulation of memory T cells that are not effective at controlling the infection and to the suppressed development of T cells that would be effective, as shown in other studies on original antigenic sin (Klenerman and Zinkernagel, 1998; Mongkolsapaya et al., 2003). Overall these results indicate that prior viral infections can either augment or inhibit viral clearance during subsequent infections with unrelated viruses.",

LCMV\u2010immune mice infected intraperitoneally with VV developed an IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010dependent acute fatty necrosis associated with a cellular infiltrate in the visceral fat pads (Selin et al., 1998). In an intranasal model, LCMV\u2010immune mice infected with VV developed a severe lung pathology that was characterized by a strong lymphocytic response, and the induction of bronchiolitis obliterans, which involves the obstruction of bronchioles by fibrin and inflammatory cells (Chen et al., 2001). This development of immunopathology during sequential viral infections correlates with the activation of pre\u2010existing memory LCMV\u2010specific CD8 T cells, but additional factors may also contribute to the pathology, including altered cytokine profiles. Other studies have shown that prior infections with MCMV, influenza, and Sendai can dramatically alter the histopathology of the lung during subsequent infections with unrelated viruses (Jakab, 1990; Chen et al., 2003). Some of the immunopathologies developed following sequential viral infections resemble forms of immune\u2010mediated human diseases of unknown aetiology, with acute fatty necrosis being similar to erythema nodosum, the most common form of human panniculitis, and the induction of bronchiolitis obliterans in humans being associated with viral and bacterial infections and transplant rejections (Bolognia and Braverman, 1992; Schlesinger et al., 1998).",

However, following a subsequent viral infection these populations of memory CD8 T cells are dramatically altered, with the permanent loss of the non\u2010cross\u2010reactive T cells from the memory repertoire and an enrichment of T cells that are cross\u2010reactive with the challenge virus (Fig. 1) (Selin et al., 1996; 1999; Brehm et al., 2002). Challenge of virus\u2010immune mice with heterologous viruses that establish either acute sterilizing infections (LCMV strain Armstrong, PV, MCMV, and VV) or persistent infections (murine \u03b3herpes virus 68 and LCMV clone 13), can trigger the attrition of virus\u2010specific CD8 T cells from the memory repertoire (Liu et al., 2003; Kim and Welsh, 2004). Infection with the clone 13 variant of LCMV is associated with the continuous production of cytokines and T cell activation and resulted in an even more dramatic attrition of memory CD8 T cells relative to LCMV strain Armstrong, with greater than 10\u2010fold drops in CD8 memory T cell frequencies specific to VV, VSV, and PV\u2010encoded antigens (Kim and Welsh, 2004).",

Alternatively it could be a by\u2010product of the virus\u2010induced lymphopenia that leads to memory T cell apoptosis early in infection. Recent kinetic studies indicate that once memory cells are lost early in infection, they never return to their original frequencies, arguing for the importance of the virus\u2010induced lymphopenia in this process (Kim and Welsh, 2004). Thus, pre\u2010existing memory populations can play substantial roles in the host response to new virus infections, and those virus infections permanently alter the memory T cell pool that was present before infection.",

Acute infections with viruses such as LCMV and PV interfere with the induction of tolerance using costimulatory blockade against allogeneic skin grafts (Welsh et al., 2000). Recent studies have also shown that LCMV\u2010immune mice are refractory to the induction of tolerance against allogeneic skin resulting in graft rejection (Brehm et al., 2003), and mice that have been sequentially infected with heterologous viruses become even more difficult to tolerise to allo\u2010antigens (Adams et al., 2003). Sequential infections with heterologous viruses can increase the frequency of T cells specific for allo\u2010antigens, and create a larger pool of memory cells to tolerize before engraftment. In H\u20102b mice that had previously been infected with PV and then infected with LCMV, the induction of allo\u2010antigen\u2010specific CD8 T cells was altered, with higher frequencies of T cells specific for H\u20102k antigens and slightly reduced populations specific for H\u20102d antigens in comparison to na\u00efve mice infected with LCMV (Brehm et al., 2003). The alterations in the allo\u2010antigen\u2010specific T cell response generated in PV\u2010immune mice infected with LCMV may reflect the changes in the hierarchies of the LCMV epitope\u2010specific (Fig. 3) CD8 T cells, which cross\u2010react with allo\u2010antigens. These findings suggest that the generation of allo\u2010antigen\u2010specific memory CD8 T cells by viral infections presents a unique impediment for transplantation.",

Although parameters of this heterologous immunity have been studied most definitively in murine systems, the identification of T cells cross\u2010reactive between many common human viruses suggests that the imprint left on the human immune system by previous viral infections may alter the course of human diseases. Many viral infections present more severely in teenagers and young adults than in children (Weinstein and Meade, 1956; Simonsen et al., 1998), and one questions whether prior infections encountered earlier in life have altered the immune responses to these pathogens. Similarly, because of T cell cross\u2010reactivity, vaccination might unexpectedly impact responses to pathogens unrelated to the vaccine. The full impact of heterologous T cell\u2010dependent immunity in human infections should become clear as more is learned about the activation and fate of cross\u2010reactive T cells in human viral infections.",
