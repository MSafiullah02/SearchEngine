The fact that the disease was caused by a transmissible viral particle was demonstrated by 1908. Until early in the twentieth century the virus was readily transmitted throughout the population almost continuously by personal contact and by the fecal\u2013oral route via water. The result was that most people's first exposure to the virus occurred in infancy. At this age most infections resulted in a clinically unapparent infection, in part due to partial protection by maternal antibody, after which life-long immunity was established. Only a few suffered a paralytic episode with the infection, at the time termed \u201cinfantile paralysis.\u201d1\n",

The motors were then cycled to alternately create vacuum inside the box, expanding the patient's chest and causing the patient to inhale through the mouth (outside the box), then allowing air back into the box to permit exhalation. The design was further improved in 1931, and the machines came into increasingly broad use throughout North America and Europe during the severe outbreaks of the 1930s. Adoption of this therapy resulted in a significant reduction in mortality during these years.",

A more cost-effective and user-friendly approach to providing respiratory support was clearly needed. This finally came by bringing the positive pressure ventilation (PPV) concept out of the operating room. PPV was first used for respiratory support for polio victims at Blegdam Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, an innovation attributable to Danish anesthetist Bjorn Ibsen.4 During this large outbreak in 1952, some 200 medical students were put to work hand-ventilating dozens of patients through tracheostomies until the worst of the paralytic phase of the illness had passed, often several weeks. The concept quickly spread elsewhere and was widely adopted, yielding substantial reductions in mortality. For reasons of efficiency and convenience, patients needing respiratory support were often grouped in a single location where the necessary expertise and equipment were available. The introduction of PPV into a defined area of the hospital used to support respiratory failure was the genesis of the modern ICU and represents a signal event in the development of the field of Critical Care Medicine.",

Over 200 were affected and 34 died, an alarming mortality rate, especially since physicians caring for the patients had no idea what was causing the illness. Conventional microbiologic investigations yielded no convincing pathogens despite intensive investigation for the usual bacteria and viruses and other potential pathogens. Epidemiologic and various biologic investigations were quickly implemented by local health authorities and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These showed that the disease was likely airborne and that it occurred more frequently in older individuals who had underlying lung disease, smoked, or were relatively immunocompromised. Analysis of the likelihood of death revealed that those who received tetracyclines or macrolide antibiotics were more likely to survive than those who received only beta-lactams.

Over time, demonstration that it was a widely occurring colonizer of brackish water, particularly in air conditioners, cooling towers, and water heaters and pipes, led to the implication of these reservoirs in several hundred outbreaks of the disease worldwide, especially in hospitals and other public health institutions, and hotels.

Early in the course most patients developed a diffuse macular rash, often with mucous membrane inflammation, with subsequent desquamation during convalescence. Patients frequently required massive fluid resuscitation because of systemic capillary leak, as well as vasopressor support, mechanical ventilation for adult respiratory distress syndrome, and even renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure, complicating the shock episode. One of the early clusters of observed cases was reported in 1978, and the term \u201ctoxic shock syndrome\u201d was coined based on the isolation of an exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus from mucosal surfaces or the site of a minor infection in the absence of bacteremia.8\n",

By this time there were clear epidemiologic links between the syndrome and menstrual use of high-absorbency tampons which were often left in place longer than less absorbent products. Colonization of the tampon with Staphylococcus aureus was also implicated, consistent with the postulated toxin-mediated disease mechanism.10 Within months of these revelations the main manufacturer of the implicated tampons withdrew them from the market and women began changing tampons with greater frequency or stopped using them at the urging of public health authorities. The incidence of the syndrome immediately began to fall and within a few years, with the changing of use patterns of tampons and changes in their manufacture, toxic shock syndrome disappeared, for the most part, but not entirely, from the ICU.",

This syndrome, which was almost certainly extant before but little-recognized, was perhaps the main lesson from the outbreak: even trivial staphylococcal skin or wound infections or mucosal surface colonization in the presence of a foreign body such as a nasal pack for nosebleed can lead to a severe shock syndrome if the organism is present and produces this toxin or one of several related ones. The recognition of the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome also led to increasing understanding of the role of \u201csuperantigens\u201d as a mechanism of disease\u2014bacterial toxins capable of activating a large fraction (up to 20%) of the total T-lymphocyte population.

Microscopy of respiratory specimens revealed exponentially more organisms than previously seen, such that many patients could be diagnosed from sputum specimens rather than bronchoscopy, and biopsy was virtually never needed.

As knowledge progressed, HIV-associated Pneumocystis infection in the ICU changed its face several times over the years. At the beginning of the epidemic, most patients presenting for care with HIV/AIDS and Pneumocystosis were severely ill with diffuse pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure and many died, 80%\u201390% in most centers, prompting widespread debate about whether such patients should even be admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilatory support. However, as experience with the disease developed it became clear that an early and aggressive approach could improve prognosis. It was found that in the AIDS population even minor respiratory symptoms with few or no abnormalities on chest radiograph could be due to Pneumocystis infection in the earlier stages, and that even modest degrees of arterial oxygen desaturation signaled impending respiratory failure. Earlier bronchoscopy for diagnosis followed by prompt antimicrobial therapy, with pentamidine predominantly in the early 80s and later primarily with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, led to overall mortality rates falling to the 50%\u201360% range by the middle of the decade.",

One exposed individual was a physician from mainland China who, incubating the disease during his travel, stayed at the Metropole hotel in Hong Kong in early March. Later investigations showed that he transmitted the virus to at least 16 other guests at the hotel, who then carried it by international air travel to Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, and Canada.",

Fortunately for the course of the outbreak, one of the consultants on the case was an Italian physician working with the WHO in Vietnam, Dr. Carlo Urbani. He immediately recognized that this was a previously unknown severe atypical pneumonia that was relatively easily transmissible and reported it to the WHO; this led to immediate mobilization of investigative efforts and worldwide alerts about the threat.31 Unfortunately, in the course of caring for the victims of the disease in Hanoi, Dr. Urbani himself contracted the infection and died of it later.",

Within days, other instances of transmission from undiagnosed contacts of the initial cases in hospitals, doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and at social events were leading to admission of cases to several hospitals throughout Toronto. The response of the public health authorities, beginning soon after the WHO global alert and coincident with the recognition of the first local cases, was quick and vigorous, including closure of the main affected hospital, intensive follow-up of probable contacts, quarantine of suspected cases based on a fairly inclusive case definition and strict institution of barrier contact protection for health care workers.32 By mid-April the number of new cases was rapidly declining, although there was one cluster of late cases related to exposure of a large number of health care workers during the resuscitation and difficult intubation of a critically ill patient. A later cluster of cases also occurred in a rehabilitation hospital, where it appeared that unrecognized contacts from the first phase of the outbreak had been transferred and transmitted the disease to other patients and staff.",

The virus, more or less simultaneously characterized at a number of laboratories around the world, proved to be a previously unknown coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV) with capacity to infect and spread from a variety of wild animals to humans. Epidemiologic, serologic, and virologic evidence was developed linking human cases to exposure to infected wild animals, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, ferrets and ferret badgers, all being sold for human consumption in markets in China.33 Control of their transport and sale and exposures to humans by Chinese health authorities was probably one of the major factors in bringing the first outbreak under control, the partial failure of which later led to a second, much smaller outbreak late in 2004. Although the initial speculation was that one or more of these wild animals were the reservoir in nature for the infection, it now appears more likely that the viral reservoir is actually bats, with cross-transmission of the virus between bats, food animals, and humans in crowded markets leading to development of strains with the capacity to transmit between humans.34\n",

For the critical care community, perhaps one main lesson was the importance of \u201csuper-spreading incidents\u201d in propagating the disease in hospitals. Many of these occurred in critically ill patients undergoing resuscitation with difficult or traumatic intubation, generating aerosols in closed spaces which contained many superfluous and inadequately protected health care workers. Handling these situations safely depends crucially on identifying the potential risk and undertaking the resuscitation and intubation using the most experienced operators available, adequately protected with basic barrier precautions (eye protection, gloves and surgical face-masks), using sedation or paralysis as necessary to minimize trauma and aerosol generation, and with only essential and adequately protected staff in the room.35 This likely applies to many other situations with potential for disease transmission to health care workers.",

The most recent circulating influenza virus just before that time was an H3N8 that had arrived in 1901. Current evidence suggests that an avian influenza virus underwent a period of evolutionary adaptation, possibly in another susceptible species such as swine, fitting it for transmission to humans, which it then did.36, 37 This H1N1 virus had not been previously experienced by any segment of the population except the very old, so nearly everyone, particularly non-elderly adults and children, was without immunity and was at risk of severe infection. Attack rates, as noted earlier, were extremely high everywhere as were rates of primary influenza pneumonia, complicating bacterial pneumonia, and death. In the United States, death rates were more than 20-fold higher than in any influenza pandemic since. An outbreak of influenza on this scale, if unchecked by effective antiviral therapy or vaccines, would render ICU care such as mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure irrelevant. Even today, with maximal respiratory support, most patients with diffuse primary viral pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure cannot be saved, and the numbers presenting for such care in a short space of time, if comparable to the 1918 pandemic, would overwhelm our current ICU capacity within days.",
