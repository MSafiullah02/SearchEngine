            "text": "Bacteria use several different secretion systems to deliver toxic EndoU ribonucleases into neighboring cells. Here, we present the first structure of a prokaryotic EndoU toxin in complex with its cognate immunity protein. The contact-dependent growth inhibition toxin CdiA-CT STECO31 from Escherichia coli STEC_O31 adopts the eukaryotic EndoU fold and shares greatest structural homology with the nuclease domain of coronavirus Nsp15. The toxin contains a canonical His-His-Lys catalytic triad in the same arrangement as eukaryotic EndoU domains, but lacks the uridylate-specific ribonuclease activity that characterizes the superfamily. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that bacterial EndoU domains segregate into at least three major clades based on structural variations in the N-terminal subdomain. Representative EndoU nucleases from clades I and II degrade tRNA molecules with little specificity. In contrast, CdiA-CT STECO31 and other clade III toxins are specific anticodon nucleases that cleave tRNA Glu between nucleotides C37 and m 2 A38. These findings suggest that the EndoU fold is a versatile scaffold for the evolution of novel substrate specificities. Such functional plasticity may account for the widespread use of EndoU effectors by diverse inter-bacterial toxin delivery systems.",

            "text": "Bacteria are social organisms that engage in cooperative and antagonistic relationships with their neighbors. Many of these interactions are mediated by small signaling molecules, such as quorum sensing auto-inducers, which coordinate group activities like biofilm formation and virulence gene expression (Lopez et al., 2010; Ng and Bassler, 2009) . Diffusible inhibitory factors, such as antibiotics and bacteriocins, are exploited as weapons to eliminate rivals (Cascales et al., 2007, Ghequire and De Mot, 2014) . Research over the past decade has revealed that bacteria also antagonize their neighbors through direct delivery of protein toxins Souza et al., 2015; Whitney et al., 2017; Vassallo et al., 2017) . This phenomenon was first discovered as \"contact-dependent growth inhibition\" (CDI) between different strains of Escherichia coli (Aoki et al., 2005) . CDI is mediated by a subfamily of type V secretion systems (T5SS) that are widely distributed throughout proteobacteria, fusobacteria and negativicutes (Aoki et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; . T5SS/CDI + bacteria use CdiB transporters to export and present filamentous CdiA proteins on the cell surface. CdiA proteins carry a variety of polymorphic C-terminal effector domains (CdiA-CT), which are transferred directly into neighboring bacteria upon binding specific receptors (Aoki et al., 2008; Beck et al., 2016; Ruhe et al., 2017) . T5SS/CDI loci also encode immunity proteins that neutralize CdiA-CT toxin activity and protect the cell against self-inhibition. After the discovery of CDI, type VI secretion systems (T6SS) were also found to mediate proximity-dependent inter-bacterial competition (Hood et al., 2010; MacIntyre et al., 2010) . The T6SS is a bacteriophage-like contractile apparatus that injects protein effectors directly into nearby target bacteria (Basler et al., 2012) . In contrast to CdiA effectors, which carry a single toxin domain, the T6SS apparatus supports simultaneous delivery of multiple toxins with distinct activities . Other secretion systems were first predicted to mediate inter-bacterial competition based on genetic linkage to toxin/immunity gene pairs. Zhang et al. predicted that Neisseria species export MafB toxins through type II secretion systems (T2SS), and that Grampositive bacteria use type VII secretion systems (T7SS) to deploy LXG/WXG100/ESAT-6 effectors (Zhang et al., 2012) . Those predictions were subsequently supported by experimental work showing that both systems produce toxins and mediate inter-cellular competition (Holberger et al., 2012; Jamet et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016; Ohr et al., 2017; Whitney et al., 2017) . Further experimental studies uncovered additional polymorphic toxin delivery systems. Bacillus and Listeria use large cell-wall associated YD-repeat proteins to exchange polymorphic toxin domains (Koskiniemi et al., 2013) . Xanthomonas species deliver toxins though a specialized type IV secretion system (Souza et al., 2015) , and a type I secretion system mediates contact-dependent competition in Caulobacter crescentus (Garcia-Bayona et al., 2017) . Most recently, polymorphic lipoprotein toxins were shown to inhibit cell growth when transferred between strains of Myxococcus xanthus through outer membrane exchange (Dey et al., 2016; Vassallo et al., 2017) . Collectively, these observations indicate that inter-cellular toxin exchange is a fundamental and ubiquitous facet of prokaryotic biology.",

            "text": "Toxin delivery mechanisms are manifold because the architecture of the bacterial cell envelope varies considerably between phyla. Thus, systems capable of breaching the Gram-negative envelope are ineffective against Grampositive bacteria and vice versa. Nonetheless, divergent secretion systems from unrelated species often deploy closely related toxins. For example, uropathogenic E. coli isolates use T5SS/CdiA to deliver Ntox28 RNase domains into target bacteria . Ntox28 toxins also form the C-terminal domains of YD-peptide repeat proteins and T7SS effectors from Gram-positive bacteria (Zhang et al., 2012; Diner et al., 2012) . The Ntox28 toxins of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria share similar tRNA anticodon nuclease activities, and their cognate immunity proteins are clearly homologous (Johnson et al., 2016) . This sporadic distribution across unrelated species strongly suggests that toxin-immunity gene pairs are spread through horizontal gene transfer (Zhang et al., 2012; Poole et al., 2011; Ruhe et al., 2016) . In this model, newly acquired toxin-immunity sequences are integrated into resident secretion system loci through genetic recombination (Aoki et al., 2010; Poole et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Arenas et al., 2013; Unterweger et al., 2014) . The modular organization of antibacterial effectors facilitates this process. Effector proteins are typically composites in which variable C-terminal toxins are fused to conserved N-terminal elements that guide export through a specific secretion system (Zhang et al., 2012; Koskiniemi et al., 2013) . Thus, polymorphic toxins are versatile payloads that can be delivered through several different secretion pathways.",

            "text": "EndoU (Endoribonuclease specific for uridylate) RNase domains are among the most commonly deployed toxins in bacterial competition (Zhang et al., 2012) . Aravind and colleagues first predicted that these toxins are related in structure and activity to eukaryotic and viral RNA processing enzymes (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011) . XendoU is the founding member of the EndoU superfamily and was isolated from Xenopus laevis as a uridylate specific endonuclease that releases small nucleolar RNAs from introns (Caffarelli et al., 1994; Caffarelli et al., 1997; Gioia et al., 2005; Laneve et al., 2003) . RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales also encode EndoU nucleases. Nidoviral EndoU (NendoU) domains form the C-termini of nonstructural proteins (Nsp) Nsp15 in coronaviruses and Nsp11 in arteriviruses (Snijder et al., 2003; Nedialkova et al., 2009) . These endonucleases are essential for viral replication and have recently been shown to interfere with innate immune responses (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Ivanov et al., 2004; Kindler et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2017) . XendoU and NendoU nucleases have the same core built from two \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomains and share a common catalytic triad that emanates from the N-terminal subdomain (Joseph et al., 2007; Renzi et al., 2006; Ricagno et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) . Though unrelated in sequence and fold, EndoU and eukaryotic RNase A nucleases have remarkably similar active sites and use the same catalytic mechanism to produce cyclic 2\u2032-3\u2032-phosphodiester and 5\u2032-hydroxyl termini (Laneve et al., 2003; Ivanov et al., 2004; Renzi et al., 2006; Ricagno et al., 2006; Nedialkova et al., 2009) . Two bacterial EndoU toxins have been shown to have RNase activity (Holberger et al., 2012; Jamet et al., 2015) , but there is currently no high-resolution structural information for the prokaryotic enzymes. Here, we present the first structure of a bacterial EndoU toxin-immunity protein complex from the T5SS/CDI system of E. coli STEC_O31. The CdiA-CT STECO31 nuclease domain adopts the EndoU fold and contains a canonical catalytic triad, but unexpectedly it lacks the characteristic uridylate specificity of the superfamily. Instead, CdiA-CT STECO31 is an anticodon loop nuclease that preferentially cleaves after a cytidylate residue in tRNA UUC Glu . This unique specificity is correlated with a distinct architecture that differs from previously characterized prokaryotic EndoU toxins.",

            "text": "We co-expressed the CdiA-CT STECO31 toxin together with His 6 -tagged CdiI STECO31 immunity protein and purified the complex by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography. Limited proteolysis with subtilisin was used to generate a complex that is suitable for crystallization (Fig. S1 ). This treatment removed the N-terminal \"translocation\" domain of CdiA-CT STECO31 . This domain does not affect toxin activity, but is required to transfer the CdiA-CT into the cytoplasm of target bacteria . The truncated CdiA-CT STECO31 and full-length CdiI STECO31 crystallized in space group P6 5 with one complex in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined at 2.0 \u00c5 by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion approach using selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled proteins ( Table 1 ). The final model contains residues Lys181 -Lys323 of CdiA-CT STECO31 and CdiI STECO31 residues Met1 -Pro120. The C-terminal domain of CdiA-CT STECO31 adopts a V-shaped structure comprised of two \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomains (Fig. 1A) . The N-terminal subdomain consists of a \u03b2-hairpin (\u03b21 and \u03b22) followed by helix \u03b11 and an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet. The sheet is composed of three major strands (\u03b23, \u03b24 and \u03b26) and a shorter \u03b25 strand that together with \u03b26 flanks \u03b24. The C-terminal subdomain begins at helix \u03b12 and continues as an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b27, \u03b28 and \u03b29). The N-terminal tail crosses over to the adjacent subdomain, bringing the N-and C-termini into close proximity. The CdiI STECO31 immunity protein is composed of a core antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21\u2032, \u03b22\u2032, \u03b23\u2032 and \u03b24\u2032) surrounded by helices \u03b11\u2032, \u03b12\u2032, \u03b13\u2032 and \u03b14\u2032 (Fig. 1A) . The \u03b2-sheet is located topologically between helices \u03b12\u2032 and \u03b13\u2032. The immunity protein also contains three short sections (G1\u2032, G2\u2032 and G3\u2032) that adopt 3 10 -helical geometry (Fig. 1A) . CdiI STECO31 binds between the two subdomains of the toxin domain, with its \u03b2-sheet inserting into the toxin cleft (Fig. 1A) . The N-terminus and helix \u03b11\u2032 of CdiI STECO31 interact with the C-terminal subdomain of the toxin, and the long G1\u2032 loop contacts the N-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1A) . The interface buries approximately 1,600 \u00c5 2 , corresponding to ~20% of the total solvent-accessible surface area as determined by PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007) . The interaction network is elaborate and features numerous direct contacts and more than 20 water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1B , Tables 2 and S1). Moreover, the toxin cleft is strongly electropositive, and several anionic residues from CdiI STECO31 form salt-bridges (Fig. 1C ). Asp48 and Asp78 of CdiI STECO31 form salt-bridges with toxin residues Lys261 and Lys181 respectively. Arg307 and Tyr309 from the toxin also converge on the main-chain carbonyl of CdiI STECO31 Asp48. CdiI STEO31 Tyr75 makes direct H-bond contacts with His187, Gly202 and His204 ( Fig. 1B and Table 2 ). The side-chains of Trp17, Thr18, Asn28 and Glu29 emanate from CdiI STECO31 helix \u03b11\u2032 to make contacts with toxin residues Gly293, Gln295, Asp298 and Arg307 respectively (Figs. 1B and C). Additionally, CdiI STECO31 Trp17 makes van der Waals contacts in a pocket formed by toxin residues Gln295 and Gln312 (Fig. 1C ). The N-terminal subdomain of the toxin interacts primarily with CdiI STECO31 helix \u03b12\u2032 and the long G1\u2032 loop that links \u03b22\u2032 to \u03b23\u2032. Toxin residue Lys257 is the focal point of interactions with sidechains of Asp34, Glu37 and Asn38 from immunity helix \u03b12\u2032 ( Fig. 1B and C) . Residues Asp61 and Ser63 from the G1\u2032 loop form direct H-bonds with toxin residue Lys197 ( Fig. 1B and Table 2 ), and CdiI STECO31 Tyr60 packs against residues Ala243, Ala244 and Gly245, which form the \u03b2-turn connecting toxin strands \u03b24 and \u03b25 (Fig. 1C) .",

            "text": "Consistent with its annotation as an EndoU toxin, the DALI server returned eukaryotic EndoU domains as the closest structural homologs of CdiA-CT STECO31 (Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010) . Coronaviral NendoU domains were the top hits in the search: coronavirus 229E Nsp15 (PDB:4S1T), Z = 6.1, rmsd 3.6 \u00c5 over 100 C\u03b1 atoms; SARS Nsp15 (PDB:2RHB (Bhardwaj et al., 2008) ) Z = 6.0, rmsd 3.6 \u00c5 over 101 C\u03b1 atoms; SARS Nsp15 (PDB:2H85 (Ricagno et al., 2006) ), Z = 6.0, rmsd 3.5 \u00c5 over 100 C\u03b1 atoms, and murine hepatitis virus Nsp15 (PDB:2GTH (Xu et al., 2006) ), Z = 5.5, rmsd 3.8 \u00c5 for 101 C\u03b1 atoms. The NendoU domains and CdiA-CT STECO31 toxin have essentially identical topologies, though some secondary structure elements vary in length and relative position ( Fig. 2A and B) . Notably, NendoU domains harbor the two catalytic His residues within helix \u03b18 and the adjacent loop, which corresponds to loop \u03b22-\u03b11 that follows the \u03b21-\u03b22 hairpin of the toxin domain ( Figs. 2A and B ). CdiA-CT STECO31 also contains additional residues that form strand \u03b25 and contribute to an elongated helix \u03b12 (Fig. 2B ). XendoU (PDB:2C1W (Renzi et al., 2006) ) is more distantly related to the toxin at Z = 5.2, rmsd 3.1 \u00c5 over 108 C\u03b1 atoms. As with Nsp15, the XendoU active-site loop aligns poorly with the \u03b21-\u03b22 hairpin of the toxin ( Fig. 2C and D). NendoU domains from arteriviral Nsp11 proteins show the lowest structural similarity to the toxin. Nsp11 from porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PDB:5DA1) was recovered at Z = 4.5 with rmsd 3.7 \u00c5 over 84 C\u03b1 atoms. Notably, sequence homology between CdiA-CT STECO31 and the eukaryotic EndoU domains is low, ranging from ~9% identity with XendoU up to about 15% for A. The CdiA-CT/CdiI STECO31 complex is depicted in cartoon with the toxin domain colored blue and the immunity protein colored green. Secondary structure elements are labeled with CdiI STECO31 elements denoted by a prime (\u2032) symbol. B. The toxin-immunity protein interface is depicted with selected side-chains forming direct hydrogen bonds (black dashed lines) shown in a stick representation. Water molecules that mediate interactions are shown as red spheres. C. Charge complementarity at the toxin-immunity protein interface. The electrostatic potential of the toxin surface was calculated using Coulomb's law with Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) . Potentials range from -10 kcal/mol*e (red) to +10 kcal/mol*e (blue ",

However, structural similarity with pseudopilins is limited to the C-terminal subdomain of the toxin. Two prokaryotic EndoU toxins have been characterized to date. BC0920 from Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 is a putative T7SS effector that degrades rRNA and tRNA in vivo (Holberger et al., 2012) . MafB1 from Neisseria meningitidis 8013 cleaves RNA after uridylate nucleotides in vitro (Jamet et al., 2015) . To determine whether CdiA-CT STECO31 possesses similar activity, we expressed the toxin in E. coli and examined RNA for degradation. Although the toxin inhibited cell growth (Fig. S2A) , there was no obvious RNase activity in the intoxicated cells (Fig. S2B ). Because several CDI toxins cleave specific tRNAs Michalska et al., 2017) , we used Northern blot analysis to identify possible tRNA substrates. This screen revealed efficient cleavage of tRNA UUC Glu in CdiA-CT STECO31 intoxicated cells, but not in cells expressing other toxins (Fig. 3) . We also detected modest nuclease activity against tRNA GUC (Fig. 3) . These results indicate that CdiA-CT STECO31 exhibits a tRNase activity that is novel for the EndoU superfamily.",

Although it shares only ~16% sequence identity with CdiI STECO31 (Fig. 4B ), NMB0503 is probably an immunity protein A. CdiA-CT STECO31 (blue) and the C-terminal domain of SARS Nsp15 (PDB: 2H85, pink) were aligned using secondary structure matching (SSM) superposition calculated in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) . The \u03b21-\u03b22 hairpin of CdiA-CT STECO31 and helix \u03b18 in the NendoU activesite loop are indicated. B. The sequences of the CdiA-CT STECO31 and SARS Nsp15 C-terminal domains were aligned based on structure using DALI (Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010) . The resulting sequence alignment was rendered using Espript (Robert and Gouet, 2014) . Identical residues are highlighted in red, and similar residues are shown in red font. The predicted catalytic triad residues are marked with green stars. because the upstream NMB0502 reading frame encodes a C-terminal EndoU domain that is 39% identical to CdiA-CT STECO31 (Fig. 4C ). Moreover, NMB0502 has the same tRNase activity as CdiA-CT STECO31 when expressed in E. coli (Fig. S3 ). The structures of the two immunity proteins deviate in three regions: (i) NMB0503 contains an N-terminal helix (\u03b10\u2032) that is absent from CdiI STECO31 ; (ii) the loop connecting \u03b22\u2032 to \u03b23\u2032 is extended in NMB0503 and contains an additional 3 10 helix and (iii) CdiI STECO31 contains a 3 10 helix (G2\u2032) in the loop connecting \u03b23\u2032 to \u03b24\u2032 (Fig. 4B ). Given that these secondary structure elements interact with the toxin domain in the CdiA-CT/CdiI STECO31 structure (Fig. 4A) , the discrepancies may reflect the toxin-free state of NMB0503 (Tan et al., 2015) . However, NMB0502 diverges from CdiA-CT STECO31 in regions that interact directly with CdiI STECO31 (Fig. 4C) , suggesting that these differences are critical for specific binding interactions between toxins and cognate immunity proteins. This conclusion is supported by alignments of closely related EndoU toxins and immunity proteins, which show that each pair possesses a unique set of residues contributing to the binding interface (Fig. S4) .",

Inhibitor cells expressing the chimeric CDI STECO31 system significantly outcompeted E. coli target bacteria when seeded at a 1:1 ratio in co-culture (Fig. 5A) . Northern blot analysis revealed cleaved tRNA UUC Glu in the mixed culture (Fig. 5C ). Because inhibitor cells are immune to the toxin, the latter result suggests that most of the tRNA UUC Glu is degraded in target bacteria.

By contrast, targets expressing near-cognate NMB0503 were inhibited to the same extent as cells with no immunity gene (Fig. 5A) , and Northern blot showed that NMB0503 failed to neutralize tRNase activity (Fig. 5C ). We then tested whether a more closely related immunity protein blocks CdiA-CT STECO31 . The T5SS/CDI locus of Yersinia mollaretii ATCC 43969 encodes an EndoU toxin and immunity protein that are ~55% and ~58% identical to CdiA-CT STECO31 and CdiI STECO31 respectively ( Fig.  4B and C). Despite this homology, cdiI Ymo43969 expression did not protect target cells from CDI STECO31 mediated growth inhibition ( Fig. 5A and C). To confirm that the cdiI Ymo43969 construct produces functional immunity protein, we tested it against inhibitor cells that express a CdiA EC93 -CT Ymo43969 fusion protein. The chimeric CDI Ymo43969 system is less potent than CDI STECO31 (compare Fig. 5B to A), but toxic nuclease activity was detected in co-cultures with non-immune target cells (Fig. 5D ). As expected, target cells that express CdiI Ymo43969 were immune to CDI Ymo43969 mediated growth inhibition and nuclease activity, but near-cognate CdiI STECO31 failed to protect target bacteria (Figs. 5B and 5D) . Surprisingly, we found that NMB0503-expressing target cells were not killed in co-culture with CDI Ymo43969 inhibitors (Fig.  5B ). Nevertheless, cleaved tRNA UUC Glu accumulated in this latter co-culture (Fig. 5D ), demonstrating that NMB0503 immunity protein does not completely block tRNase activity. Presumably, the NMB0503 expressing target cells retained enough full-length tRNA to support growth. Taken together, these results indicate that each EndoU toxin-immunity protein interaction is distinct. The EndoU nuclease active site Eukaryotic EndoU nucleases cleave phosphodiester bonds using a His-His-Lys catalytic triad (Ivanov et al., 2004; Guarino et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2007; Nedialkova et al., 2009) . The EndoU catalytic mechanism is similar to that of RNase A, which uses two His residues to mediate proton transfers and Lys to stabilize the pentavalent phosphoryl transition-state (Findlay et al., 1962; Deavin et al., 1966; Cuchillo et al., 2011) . Structural superimposition suggests that toxin residues His187 and His204 are equivalent to the catalytic His residues in SARS Nsp15 (His234/His249) and XendoU (His162/His178) (Fig. 6A) . Further, CdiA-CT STECO31 Lys261 is positioned near Lys289 of Nsp15 and Lys224 of XendoU (Fig. 6A) . The EndoU active site also contains conserved residues that contribute to uridylate specificity.",

The structure overlay suggests that CdiA-CT STECO31 residues Thr262 and His321 may also function in substrate discrimination (Fig. 6A) . Finally, toxin residue Pro322 superimposes closely onto conserved Pro residues that are required for Nsp15 nuclease activity (Fig. 6A ) (Ricagno et al., 2006; Bhardwaj et al., 2008) . We probed the CdiA-CT STECO31 active site using site-directed mutagenesis. We first introduced Ala substitutions into the CdiA EC93 -CT STECO31 chimera and tested inhibition activity in competition co-cultures. Mutation of His187, His204, Lys261, Thr262 and His321 abrogated growth inhibition (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, substitution of Asn319 in the toxin active site had no discernable effect on inhibition activity (Fig. 6B ). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that each CdiA variant was produced at the same level as the wildtype effector (Fig. S5) . Furthermore, the mutated effectors were susceptible to degradation with extracellular proteinase K (Fig. S5) , indicating that each was exported to the cell surface properly. Although target bacteria were not inhibited by cells deploying the Lys261Ala and Thr262Ala toxin variants (Fig. 6B) , we detected tRNase activity in these co-cultures (Fig. 6C) . Presumably, these latter toxins are attenuated enough to allow target cell growth.",

The Thr262Ala and His321Ala substitutions also significantly reduced nuclease activity compared to wild-type (Fig. 6D ). Purified Asn319Ala toxin retained nuclease activity (Fig.  6D) , consistent with its near wild-type function in the competition co-culture experiments (Fig. 6C) . These results suggest that CdiA-CT STECO31 uses the same metal-independent catalytic mechanism as RNase A and eukaryotic EndoU nucleases. Consistent with this model, we found that purified CdiA-CT STECO31 retains robust tRNase activity in reactions supplemented with EDTA (Fig. S6) .

Clade I domains are related to the previously characterized MafB1 toxin from N. meningitidis 8013 (Jamet et al., 2015) (Fig. 7A) . Clade I toxins are characterized by greatly abbreviated N-terminal subdomains that lack the \u03b11, \u03b23, \u03b24 and \u03b25 elements of CdiA-CT STECO31 (Fig. S7 ). Clade I toxins contain additional residues between \u03b12 and \u03b27 in the C-terminal subdomain and sometimes carry extended C-terminal tails (Fig. S7 ). Clade II toxins are similar to BC0920 from B. cereus ATCC 14579 and are predicted to lack helix \u03b11 (Figs. 7A and S7).

For clade I, we chose a predicted CdiA-CT from Klebsiella aerogenes GN05224, reasoning that it should be functional when fused to CdiA EC93 to generate a chimeric effector. Additionally, the CdiA-CT GN05224 EndoU domain shares 61% sequence identity with the previously characterized N. meningitidis MafB1 toxin (Jamet et al., 2015) . Purified CdiA-CT GN05224 degrades 5S rRNA and several tRNA species in vitro (Fig. 7B ). Similar RNase activity was detected in competition co-cultures with inhibitor cells that deploy CdiA-CT GN05224 , though 5S rRNA degradation was not observed in vivo (Fig. S8) , presumably because it is protected by ribosomal proteins. We also found that CdiA-CT GN05224 RNase activity is effectively neutralized by CdiI GN05224 immunity protein in vitro (Fig. 7B ) and in vivo (Fig. S8) . We chose B. cereus BC0920 as a representative clade II toxin and found that its RNase activity is similar to that of CdiA-CT GN05224 (Fig. 7B) . Like the other nucleases, BC0920 activity was suppressed when the reaction was supplemented with purified BC0921 immunity protein (Fig. 7B) . Finally, we confirmed the substrate specificity of CdiA-CT STECO31 toxin in vitro. Purified CdiA-CT STECO31 cleaves tRNA UUC Glu efficiently and shows partial activity on tRNA GCC Gly , but has no discernable activity on tRNA GAU Ile , tRNA GUA Tyr or 5S rRNA (Fig. 7B) . Moreover, CdiA-CT STECO31 is most likely a specific endonuclease, because it produces stable 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments of tRNA UUC Glu (Fig. 7B ).",

Therefore, we designed an oligonucleotide that anneals downstream of the anticodon for primer extension analysis (Fig. 8A) . Analysis of 3\u2032-fragments generated from in vivo toxin expression revealed cleavage at the 5\u2032-side of m 2 A38 ( Fig. 8B and C) . This same site was observed in tRNA UUC Glu isolated from competition co-cultures. As expected, these cleavages were not detected in cells that express cdiI STECO31 (Fig. 8B) . We also determined the same cleavage site in tRNA UUC Glu digested with purified CdiA-CT STECO31 in vitro (Fig. 8B ). This latter result confirms that CdiA-CT STECO31 is directly responsible for producing the 3\u2032-fragment, and strongly suggests that the toxin cleaves the phosphodiester linking nucleotides C37 and m 2 A38 (Fig. 8C , red arrow).",

            "text": "Aravind and colleagues first identified the link between eukaryotic EndoU RNases and a broadly distributed family of antibacterial toxins (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011) . The structure of CdiA-CT STECO31 confirms those predictions, and mutational analysis suggests that this toxin uses the same catalytic mechanism as eukaryotic EndoU nucleases. However, there are also significant differences between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleases. Purified XendoU and Nsp15 are only active in the presence of millimolar Mn 2+ or Ca 2+ (Laneve et al., 2003; Schwarz and Blower, 2014; Ivanov et al., 2004; Bhardwaj et al., 2004) , whereas the bacterial toxins examined here have no metal requirement. There is no direct role for divalent metal in the EndoU catalytic mechanism (Ricagno et al., 2006; Renzi et al., 2006) , and like the bacterial toxins, arteriviral Nsp11 is active in the absence of metal (Nedialkova et al., 2009) . These observations suggest that metals may promote XendoU and Nsp15 nuclease activity through allostery. This model is consistent with data showing that SARS Nsp15 undergoes conformational changes upon titration with Mn 2+ (Bhardwaj et al., 2004) . Allosteric regulation could be mediated by the additional structural elements found in eukaryotic EndoU enzymes. Bacterial EndoU domains are about half the size of XendoU, which contains ~150 additional N-terminal residues that form an extensive \u03b1-helical cradle that surrounds and supports the nuclease core (Renzi et al., 2006) . In this model, conformational changes in the supporting cradle would reshape the active-site cleft and/or alter the configuration of the catalytic triad. The supporting structures in NendoU domains are abbreviated, but Nsp11 and Nsp15 contain additional N-terminal domains that mediate oligomerization (Bhardwaj et al., 2008; Ricagno et al., 2006) . Oligomerization is critical for Nsp15 activity because the active-site loop is stabilized by the \u03b210-\u03b211 \"supporting loop\", which is in turn conformationally constrained by the neighboring protomer (Joseph et al., 2007; Guarino et al., 2005) . In monomeric Nsp15, the active-site loop is untethered and migrates into the substrate-binding groove, where it presumably blocks the interaction with substrate RNA. Similarly, one of the active-site loops is disordered in crystal structures of homodimeric Nsp11, again raising the possibility that RNase activity is regulated through multimerization (Shi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Joseph et al., 2007) . These findings suggest that eukaryotic EndoU proteins must be carefully controlled because unrestrained RNase activity is lethal. Such allosteric control should not be required of prokaryotic EndoU nucleases, because these enzymes are used to inhibit bacterial cell growth. Nevertheless, the potent toxic effects of EndoU nucleases must be suppressed in the producing cell, thus providing the selective pressure to evolve immunity proteins that protect against self-intoxication. The narrow substrate specificity of CdiA-CT STECO31 is surprising given that all previously characterized EndoU enzymes cleave RNAs after uridylate. The determinants governing EndoU nuclease specificity have been examined most extensively for viral NendoU proteins. Ser293 in Nsp15 (Ser228 in XendoU) is predicted to form specific H-bond contacts with uracil, and Ala substitutions at this position relax specificity and increase the rate of cleavage at cytidylate nucleotides (Ricagno et al., 2006; Bhardwaj et al., 2008; Nedialkova et al., 2009) . The corresponding residue in CdiA-CT STECO31 is Thr262, which is able to form the same H-bond contacts with uracil as Ser. Moreover, Thr residues at this position have been shown to promote uridylate specificity in other NendoU-containing proteins (Bhardwaj et al., 2008; Nedialkova et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, CdiA-CT STECO31 does not recognize uridylate and instead cleaves tRNA UUC Glu between nucleotides C37 and m 2 A38. The in vivo toxin activity screen suggests that the C37-A38 motif is a positive recognition determinant, because tRNA GUC Asp and tRNA Gly isoacceptors share this element and are subject to partial cleavage. However, the toxin probably monitors the overall structure of the anticodon loop, because it discriminates against the tRNA GUC Asp anticodon, which differs from tRNA UUC Glu only at nucleotide 35. All of the clade III toxins examined here have anticodon nuclease activity, suggesting that their shared architecture determines substrate specificity. Clade III domains are characterized by helix \u03b11, which is apparently absent from the other clades. Helix \u03b11 supports the \u03b21-\u03b22-hairpin in the CdiA-CT STECO31 structure, and therefore it is conceivable that this structural element shapes the active-site cleft. We note that clade III also contains toxins from Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species that appear to lack strand \u03b25 in the N-terminal subdomain (see Fig. S7 ). It will be of interest to determine whether these enzymes share anticodon nuclease activity with CdiA-CT STECO31 or perhaps exhibit distinct substrate specificities.",

            "text": "The EndoU superfamily is one of the most widely used toxins in inter-bacterial competition. Aravind and colleagues initially identified EndoU effectors associated with T2SS/MafB, T5SS, T6SS and T7SS delivery platforms (Zhang et al., 2012; Holberger et al., 2012; Jamet et al., 2015) . More recent database searches indicate that EndoU domains are deployed by several other systems -some of which have been previously described and others that appear to be novel. We identified bacterial EndoU domains fused to the C-termini of PrsW, SpvB and MuFlike phage-head morphogenesis proteins (Table S2) , all of which have been proposed to deliver polymorphic toxins (Zhang et al., 2012) . Intriguingly, EndoU nuclease are also fused to VgrG-like proteins in Gram-positive Paenibacillus species (Table S2) . VgrG is a critical structural component of T6SS and often carries C-terminal toxin domains Ho et al., 2014) . However, T6SSs have only been characterized in Gram-negative bacteria, and Paenibacillus genomes contain no recognizable T6SS core genes. Nevertheless, these VgrG proteins are encoded together with DUF4280 (PAAR-like) and pentapeptide repeat adaptor proteins that are similar to those found in T6SS effector operons from Gram-negative bacteria. We also found a PAAR-like protein with a C-terminal EndoU domain in Clostridium sp. ASBs410 (Table S2) . Together, these observations strongly suggest that Grampositive bacteria possess phage-like secretion systems that are functionally analogous to T6SS. In addition to these recognizable toxin delivery systems, we identified EndoU-containing proteins with unusual N-terminal domains and several others that contain no other conserved domains whatsoever (Table S2 ). Some of these proteins carry N-terminal secretion signal sequences, and nearly all are encoded together with probable immunity proteins. We speculate that these latter uncharacterized proteins are also used for inter-bacterial toxin delivery. Finally, we identified a handful of extraordinarily large (1.5 to 2.9 MDa) proteins from Actinobacteria that carry internal EndoU domains. These proteins typically contain one or more APH aminoglycoside phosphotransferase domains together with a variety of RNA/DNA-binding modules (Table S3 ). The function of these proteins is not known, but they appear unlikely to mediate inter-cellular competition given the central location of the EndoU domain and the absence of linked immunity genes. The unusual domain assemblage suggests that these enormous proteins could process nucleic acids, or perhaps synthesize secondary metabolites or antibiotics in a manner similar to polyketide synthases. Regardless of their precise activities, these latter proteins suggest that EndoU domains have also been coopted to perform non-inhibitory functions in bacteria.",

DNA fragments encoding CdiA-CT/CdiI proteins from E. coli STEC_O31 and Y. mollaretii ATCC 43969 were synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) and supplied in plasmid pUC57. The fragment from E. coli STEC_O31 (Genbank: AFEX01000038) encodes residues Val2931 -Lys3253 of CdiA STECO31 (locus tag: ECSTECO31_4009) and CdiI STECO31 (ECSTECO31_4008). The initiation codon for ECSTECO31_4008 is not annotated correctly, and CdiI STECO31 contains 121 residues. The fragment from Y. mollaretii ATCC 43969 (NCBI reference: NZ_AALD02000043.1) encodes residues Val2694 -Asn2963 of CdiA Ymo43969 (YMOLL0001_RS03095) and its putative CdiI Ymo43969 immunity protein (YMOLL0001_ RS0219640). A fragment encoding Val1 -Lys360 of CdiA-CT GN05224 (YA39_RS24095) and CdiI GN05224 (YA39_RS16570) from K. aerogenes GN05224 (NCBI reference: NZ_LDBZ01000036.1) was synthesized by GenArt Gene Synthesis (ThermoFisher) and provided in plasmid pMA-T. The cdiA-CT/cdiI STECO31 module was amplified with primers 204F40 and 204R49 and introduced into plasmid pMCSG58 using ligation-independent cloning (LIC) (Eschenfeldt et al., 2013; Eschenfeldt et al., 2010; Eschenfeldt et al., 2009) . All of the resulting clones contained frame-shift mutations in the toxin coding region, suggesting that the toxin was not completely neutralized by CdiI STECO31 . Therefore, cdiI STECO31 was amplified with primer pair 204CdiIF/04R49 and introduced into plasmid pMCSG88 as described above. Vector pMCSG88 was generated by digesting pMCSG58 with HindIII/NcoI, followed by ligation to plasmid pMCSG76 (Eschenfeldt et al., 2013) . The resulting pMCSG88 construct contains the LIC site with the Clo DF13 origin of replication and a spectinomycin-resistance marker. The pMCSG58-CdiA-CT/CdiI STECO31 and pMCSG88-CdiI STECO31 expression vectors were then introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) to generate an over-expression strain for large-scale protein purification and crystallography. The cdiA-CT/cdiI STECO31 (CH3538/CH3539) and NMB0502/NMB0503 (CH2839/CH2785) modules were amplified and ligated to NcoI/SpeI-digested plasmid pCH12599 to tag the immunity proteins with C-terminal ssrA(DAS) degrons. The cdiA-CT/cdiI STECO31 product was also ligated to pCH6505 to generate plasmid pCH11884 for the purification of CdiA-CT/CdiI STECO31 complex for biochemical analyses. This latter plasmid was also used as a template for PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using primers CH4016, CH4017, CH4018, CH4019, CH4269 and CH4270. The cdiA-CT/cdiI GN05224 module was amplified with primers SK724/DL3986 and ligated to pET28a via NcoI/XhoI restrictions sites to generate plasmid pDAL8956. The cdiI STECO31 (CH3854/CH3539), cdiI GN05224 (SK733/DL3986) and BC0921 (CH4398/ CH1706) immunity genes were also cloned into pET21S for the purification of His 6 -tagged immunity proteins under non-denaturing conditions. The cdiI STECO31 (CH3854/ CH3624), cdiI GN05224 (SK733/SK734), NMB0503 (CH2784/CH2785) and cdiI Ymol43969 (CH3976/CH3977) genes were also cloned into pTrc99a derivatives to test for immunity function in competition co-cultures.",
