This and the ongoing cloning of the above Golgi membrane transporters raises the challenge to determine the relationship of structural homologs of the above transporters to specific functions. Do many of the Golgi membrane transporters have common structural features? Biochemical experiments with Golgi vesicles have suggested that nucleotide sugar transporters have a putative binding motif, determined by the nucleoside base (Capasso and Hirschberg, 1984) and a putative translocation motif, which is determined by the sugar (Capasso and Hirschberg, 1984) , that is, GMP is a competitive inhibitor of GDP-fucose transport in mammals (Sommers and Hirschberg, 1982) and GDP-mannose transport in yeast (Abeijon et al., 1989) even though the former nucleotide sugar doesn't cross the yeast Golgi membrane and the latter not the mammalian one.",

UMP is the antiporter for all undine containing nucleotide sugars (Hirschberg and Snider, 1987; Waldman and Rudnick, 1990; Milla et al., 1992) ; thus, one would expect all these uridine nucleotide sugar transporters to have common structural features facing the lumenal and cytosolic side of the membrane. By analogy to the ATP/ADP transporter of mitochondria (Klingenberg, 1993) , one would expect the affinity for the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate of each transporter to be higher in its lumenal recognition domain than in its cytosolic one and the opposite for the nucleotide derivative. Hydrophobicity plots and different algorithms for the putative orientation of membrane proteins provide only a beginning hypothesis for the topography of such proteins; thus, the number of transmembrane spanning domains and regions, including the amino and carboxy terminus, facing the cytosol or the lumen will need to be determined directly. The quaternary structure of these transporters is important to establish: to what extent is recent evidence showing that the Golgi membrane PAPS transporter is a homodimer (Mandon et al., 1994b) , a general feature of these transporters.",

Will there be Golgi apparatuses in which there is major overlapping of these different proteins? In the case of the yeast Golgi apparatus, the possibility exists that these transporters are not polarized because in many instances, this organelle consists of only one cisternae (Preuss et al., 1992) . Nevertheless, different cisternae may be enriched in individual transporters. Clearly, all transporters could colocalize and still allow oligosaccharide chain specificity to proceed normally as a result of substrate specificities of glycosyltransferases. Within the Golgi membrane, do the transporters and the transferases exist as structural or functional complexes? Radiation inactivation studies suggest that the PAPS transporter is not in a functional complex with any corresponding sulfotransferases (Mandon et al., 1994a,b) and that galactosyl and sialyltransferases are not in a functional complex with the transporters (Fleischer et al., 1993) .

These approaches will consist of either mutagenizing different amino acids of the transmembrane and adjacent regions of these proteins or attaching such regions to plasma membrane proteins and studying their subcellular localization (Machamer, 1993; Gleeson et al, 1994; Colley, in press ). These studies with multitransmembrane proteins of the Golgi membrane (Rudolph et al, 1989; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Antebi and Fink, 1992) and the above nucleotide sugar transporters, by analogy to glycosyltransferases, may not always yield interpretable results. The extent to which constructs expressed in one cell line or organism will localize to the same organelle in another cell line or organism must be determined. Do transporters recycle between the Golgi and the ER? Some, as in S.cerevisiae (Abeijon et al., 1996) , have a KKXX signal (Jackson et al., 1990; Townsley and Pelham, 1994; Schroeder et al, 1995) , while some in K.lactis (Abeijon et al, 1996) do not. Is this of relevance?",
