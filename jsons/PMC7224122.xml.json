The linear CRS was calculated as the steeper segment between the lower inflection point and upper inflection point of the curve at zero PEEP. The derecruited volume from set PEEP to zero PEEP was measured (Rec) and consisted in the volume difference between the pressure\u2013volume curves recorded at set PEEP and zero PEEP that were graphically superimposed and compared at an elastic pressure of 20 cmH2O [30, 31]. Rec was also normalized to the applied level of set PEEP: Rec/PEEPTOT was computed as the ratio between Rec and PEEPTOT, and patients were classified as having a highly recruitable profile when Rec/PEEPTOT > 14.5 ml/cmH2O [32].",

Prone positioning may yield increases in intracranial pressure [38]; the use of high PEEP may not be safe in all brain-injured patients due to its possible detrimental effects on central venous pressure, venous return, cardiac output, and intracranial pressure [39]; thus, lowering VT appears as the only available intervention to enhance lung protection in this context [40]. This appears of crucial importance when brain injury coexists, as these patients are burdened by high risk of respiratory complications, high tracheostomy rates, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and worse clinical outcome [2, 13, 41, 42].",

Our protocol led to an increase in the proportion of patients showing \u2206P \u2264 14 cmH2O from 39 to 89%, thus suggesting a possible clinical benefit by this approach. Although VT and \u2206P reductions are among the most important modifiable factors capable of improving survival during ARDS [47], the use of HH was not associated with improved clinical outcome in wide unselected cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients [48]. In previous studies, however, the use of HH was not systematically accompanied by VT reduction as it is in our protocol, so that any possible benefit could have been underestimated.",

Lung volume change as a response to PEEP may significantly vary among patients according to different degrees of lung recruitability [53, 54]. Accordingly, only 17\u201322% of our patients showed a high recruitability profile (i.e., > 14.5 ml/cmH2O of PEEP), as compared to 50% of patients in previous ARDS cohorts [32], so that the scarce derecruitment effect of lower tidal volume observed in our study may be explained by this particular characteristic of the studied population. In this sense, because of the risk of further impairment in oxygenation that can be fatal in brain-injured subjects, we did not enroll patients with severe ARDS who, indeed, show the highest lung recruitability profile [54, 55]. Moreover, higher PEEP (up to 20 cmH2O or further) may be required to achieve optimal lung recruitment [56] and such values may be difficult to apply in brain-injured patients.",

The substantial equivalence between most of the parameters in step HME1 and HME2 suggests that the patients were not subject to changes in respiratory, hemodynamic, and cerebral conditions during any of the study period, thus contributing to the strength and reproducibility of our findings. The small differences between HME1 and HME2 can be ascribed to the limited sample and the statistical rank-based test used for the analysis. Finally, initial tidal volumes and respiratory rates reflect individual clinician\u2019s attitude in the treatment of patients with brain injury, and a strictly low-tidal ventilation strategy was not applied at baseline. This is consistent with previous reports, indicating that patients with brain injury are often exposed non-protective ventilation settings [12\u201316]. Indeed, the aim of this study was limited to the assessment of the physiological effects of changing from an HME device to HH.",
