As a consequence, the total count of recovered and immunized individuals is also unknown, as only the number of recovered and detected individuals is available. This problem of partial observability of counts renders difficult the estimation of an epidemiological SIRD (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased) model, extended to disentangle the infected and undetected from the infected and detected individuals. Moreover, such substantial undocumented infection can facilitate the rapid propagation of the virus (Li et al.(2020) ).",

Section 2 describes the latent model of qualitative individual histories. These histories follow a time varying Markov process with transition probabilities that can depend on latent counts and unknown parameters. The observations are functions of the frequencies of the different states (compartments in epidemiological terminology), although not all of those frequencies are observed, in general. More specifically, only some states can be observed and/or a sum of frequencies over subsets of states can be observed. Section 3 introduces the estimation method, which jointly estimates the unknown parameters and the unknown state probabilities. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimators under identification. Identification, which is the main challenge of the proposed approach is the topic of Section 4. First, we discuss the identification in a homogeneous Markov, i.e. when the transition matrix is not time varying. Without additional restrictions on the transition probabilities, that model is not identifiable and the proposed approach cannot be used. However, it is not the case for a time varying Markov process that includes contagion effects and, and in particular for the SIR-type models used in epidemiology. The estimation approach is illustrated in Section 5 with a SIR type model for French data. Section 6 concludes. Some technical problems are discussed in the Appendices.",

We usually expect a \"phase\" transition effect: For small t, these counts increase quickly as new infected individuals are cumulated without a sufficiently high number of exits to compensate for the arrivals. This explain an increase of the curves at the beginning of the period. After that initial period, the counts of exits tend to grow and offset the new arrivals so that the curves tend to flatten. More precisely, they continue to increase, due to the propagation effect, but at a very low rate. This is the so-called flattening of the curve. This theoretical evolution depends on the choice of parameter values, especially the propagation parameters. Given the selected parameter values that allow for exogenous sources of infection, the initial convex pattern in the counts of infected is not visible.

[Insert Figure 5: Projected Evolution of Marginal Probabilities] Figure 5 displays peaks in marginal probabilities of states 2 and 3 that occur after about 98 days. At the peak, the projected count of infected and undetected (IU) individuals is over 300,000. Another pessimistic outcome is that it takes about 25 years for the marginal probabilities to decline to 0. Figure 6 below shows the projected daily new counts of ID and deceased (D) over an initial period of 60 days, which can be used for assessment of the capacity of the health sector.[Insert Figure 6: Projected Evolution of New Counts]We observe that after 60 days, the daily new death counts increase to 3000 per day. At the same time, the new hospitalizations decrease quickly over time.This paper is intended to provide a solution for incomplete counts of infected and undetected individuals and of recovered individuals. These unknown quantities can be estimated jointly with the parameters in a standard framework of a compartmental epidemiological model. This approach is illustrated in an estimation involving French count data.The methodology required daily data on the total number of deaths, not only on the deaths due to COVID. These data are available in France and other European countries [see, the website Euromomo], but are unavailable in other countries, such as Canada.The estimation approach can be extended as follows, which is left for future research:i) The model is a special nonlinear state space model, with states p(t), deterministic state equations (3.1), and (Gaussian) measurement equations:\u00c2 t = Ap(t) + u(t), where u(t) denotes the (approximately Gaussian) measurement error. Even though the joint estimation can be easy performed, as shown in Section 5.3, the general algorithms for nonlinear state space models would be preferred for updating the results at each daily arrival of new observation. For this purpose, a Robust Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)[Julian, Uhlman (1997), White (1999),Krener (2003)],an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)[Song,Grizzle (1995),Wan,Van der Merwe(2000)], and particle filters[Pitt, Shephard (1999),Schon et al.(2005)] can be applied. ii) Additional unobserved state variables could also be introduced to account for individual compliance with self-isolation measures and its dynamic [see e.g.Alvarez et al.(2020),Chudik et al.(2020),Ferguson et al.( 2020),Tang et al. (2020)]. The individual efforts (moral hazard phenomenon) have impact on the propagation parameters. This can be captured by introducing propagation parameters with stochastic heterogeneity over time. Specific heterogeneity dynamics would allow for reproducing the stop and go phenomenon [see e.g.Ferguson et al.(2020),",
