An adequate specimen required a minimum of 25 columnar epithelial cells. The collection of specimens and clinical data was approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee.",

Most of the hMPV-positive individuals were identified during the winter and spring seasons, with the peak of hMPV activity occurring in March and April. These findings are consistent with those of a study from The Netherlands that demonstrated that hMPV had a seasonal distribution [15]. The Dutch study revealed a peak of hMPV activity during December and January, which suggests that the circulation of this virus, like RSV, can vary from location to location [17]. Several other studies have documented the detection of hMPV during the winter and spring months. These studies were limited, however, because respiratory specimens from only a limited number of months were tested [9\u201312, 14]. The peak of hMPV activity followed the peaks of both RSV and influenza activity, although it is unclear whether this seasonal distribution varies from year to year. The monthly distribution for each seasonal epidemic of RSV can vary within a community [18].",

We chose this age group because the initial reports of hMPV suggested that, by age 5 years, nearly all individuals had serological evidence of hMPV infection. Although our testing was limited to young children, the circulation of the virus in this age group likely parallels its circulation in the community. Other studies of hMPV, which included both children and adults, did not reveal a significant difference in the monthly distribution between the 2 groups [9, 15]. Furthermore, the circulation of respiratory viruses in the pediatric population is often a marker for the circulation within the community [19, 20]. The identification of hMPV during the summer months suggests that low-level circulation of the virus in the community may occur throughout the year. When sensitive methods, such as genome amplification techniques, have been applied to the study of viruses with an apparent seasonal distribution, year-long circulation of the virus often is observed [21].",

This may represent an outbreak of this genotype in the community. It is unclear whether these genotypes represent distinct serotypes of hMPV or genetic variants of a prototype strain. Isolates NH 462 and NH418 in group A may represent a third distinct genotype. Further analysis with additional hMPV isolates will be required to determine whether these strains represent a distinct genotype. Two genotypes of hMPV have also been found elsewhere [2, 6\u20138, 12]. The similarity among the hMPV genotypes found in Connecticut, Canada, The Netherlands, and Australia suggests that the epidemiology of hMPV may be similar to that of other paramyxoviruses. Genetically diverse strains of RSV circulate within communities during the same year, and genetically similar strains circulate in different locations in different years [22]. However, the worldwide distribution of several distinct strains of hMPV, as is observed with influenza, cannot be ruled out by the current epidemiological data.",

The possibility that genotypes of hMPV differ in virulence is intriguing. We have previously demonstrated that specific RSV genotypes within subgroup A are associated with severity of disease [23].

Hypoxemia was observed in more than one-third of the children. These findings are consistent with the clinical features in children described elsewhere [2, 7, 11\u201313]. For children who had a chest radiograph, over one-half had abnormalities.

The role that hMPV plays as a copathogen is unclear. Recent findings about the role of hMPV in RSV disease are conflicting. Greensill et al. [8] reported a high frequency of hMPV in children with severe RSV disease. Because the seasonal distribution of hMPV and RSV appears to overlap, coinfection may be common. However, data from other studies have suggested that dual infection with RSV and hMPV is rare. Defining the length of viral shedding and determining the frequency of asymptomatic hMPV infection is essential in establishing the role that this virus plays in RSV disease. Recently, hMPV has been identified in several individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [24]. The possibility that hMPV exacerbates disease caused by the SARS coronavirus also requires further investigation.",

Therefore, we considered this patient to have been reinfected with hMPV. However, this individual had a history of prematurity, which may favor the possibility of prolonged viral shedding. Although we cannot discount the possibility of prolonged hMPV shedding, this individual may have been reinfected with a strain belonging to the same genotype as the original virus. Infection with hMPV, like RSV, may not induce protective immunity. Reinfection with RSV in childhood occurs frequently [25].
