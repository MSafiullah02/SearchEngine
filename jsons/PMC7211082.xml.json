A striking finding is that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed not only in lung alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, but also in oesophagus upper cells upper epithelial and gland cells and absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. These findings suggest that the enteric symptoms of COVID-19 may be associated with the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpressing enterocytes. Our single-cell transcriptomic study for the first time provides the evidence which indicates that the digestive system along with the respiratory tract is a potential route of COVID-19 and may have a significant impact on health policy setting regarding the prevention of COVID-19.",

In the oesophagus, ACE2 was highly expressed in upper and stratified epithelial cells. The glands also had low ACE2 expression levels. TMPRSS2 was expressed mainly in oesophagus upper epithelial and gland cells (figure 2C). However, the stratified epithelial cells expressed TMPRSS2 at very low levels (figure 2D). With regard to the stomach, the expression of ACE2 was relatively low in all clusters (figure 3C). However, TMPRSS2 was highly expressed in GMCs, PMCs and cheif cells (figure 3C,D). In the epithelial cells of the ileum, ACE2 was highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes and expressed at lower levels in progenitor absorptive cells. TMPRSS2-expressing cells were widely distributed in all epithelial cell subclusters (figure 4C,D). As for the colon, ACE2 was mainly found in enterocytes and was expressed at lower levels in immature enterocytes. (figure 5C). TMPRSS2 also showed high expression in enterocytes and immature enterocytes, which was similar to ACE2 . Relative low expression of TMPRSS2 was also found in Goblet, Ganglion and TA cells (figure 5C,D). In the lung, we found that ACE2 was mainly expressed in AT2 cells and was also found in AT1 and fibroblast cells. TMPRSS2 was also highly expressed in AT1 and AT2 cells (figure 6C,D). Therefore, AT2 cells, which have relatively high coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, may be the main host cells for SARS-CoV-2 (figure 6C,D).",

AT1cells could also be the host cells of infection, which have relatively lower expression than AT2 cells. These results were consistent with the findings of a previous study.39 In lung alveoli, AT1 epithelial cells are responsible for gas exchange and AT2 cells are in charge of surfactant biosynthesis and self-renewal.40 In SARS-CoV infection, AT2 is the major infected cell type, as assessed by viral antigen and secretory vesicle detection. Its expression in AT2 cells is variable in different donors, which may be associated with susceptibility and seriousness differences.39 Thus, we hypothesise that AT2 cells might be the key SARS-CoV-2-invaded cells in the lung and the number of AT2 cells might be associated with the severity of respiratory symptoms.",

            "text": "Besides the lung, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found in oesophageal upper and gland cells and absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. Histologically, both oesophageal and respiratory system organs, such as the trachea and lung, originate from the anterior portion of the intermediate foregut.41 After separating from the neighbouring respiratory system, the oesophagus undergoes subsequent morphogenesis from a simple columnar-to-stratified squamous epithelium.42 The upper epithelium can be nourished by submucosal glands and sustain the passage of abrasive raw food. In Barrett\u2019s oesophagus, acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium are associated with upper epithelial cells.43 In the digestive system, in addition to being expressed in oesophageal upper epithelial and gland cells, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was also found in the absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon, the most vulnerable intestinal epithelial cells. During microbial infections, intestinal epithelial cells function as a barrier and help coordinate immune responses.44 The absorptive enterocytes can be infected by coronavirus, rotavirus and noroviruses, resulting in diarrhoea by absorptive enterocytes destruction, malabsorption, unbalanced intestinal secretion and enteric nervous system activation.45\u201347 Although most virus would be dead in the strong acid environment in the stomach, there is still a possibility that the saliva and secretions could carry the virus into the digestive tract where viral replication may be sustained in these susceptible cells. Thus, the enteric symptom of diarrhoea might be associated with the infected ACE2-expressing and TMPRSS2-expressing enterocytes. This could also help explain the fact that 10% of patients presented with diarrhoea and nausea 1 or 2 days before the development of fever and respiratory symptoms.6\n",
