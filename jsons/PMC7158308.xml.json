While the majority of cases of acute community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are due to bacteria, especially Streptococcal pneumoniae and less commonly the atypical organisms, respiratory tract viruses also contribute to a substantial proportion. More importantly, in general, viral pneumonia has a higher outbreak potential. A wide spectrum of viruses can cause viral pneumonia (Table 1\n, Figure 1\n). The relative importance of these viruses depends on the host's age, immune status, comorbidity, and the local epidemiological determinants such as seasonality.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the genus Orthomyxovirus within the family Orthomyxoviridae. This enveloped virion contains eight (influenza A and B) or seven (influenza C) segments of single, negative-stranded RNA. The pleomorphic envelope is composed of two major antigenic glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Major changes in the antigenic protein structure of HA (i.e., antigenic shift) may occur and lead to a pandemic. Minor changes involving a small number of amino acid substitutions (i.e., antigenic drift) lead to an epidemic of influenza. Antigenic shift is rare, whereas significant antigenic drift occurs once every few years. Altogether, 16 different subtypes of HA and nine different subtypes of NA have been identified from influenza A viruses from various animal species (Table 2\n). Currently, two subtypes of influenza A, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, are in human circulation. Introduction of a new subtype into humans can result in a large-scale pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. This is because of the naive immunity and the absence of an effective vaccine in the initial phase of outbreak. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the twentieth century. The most severe of these was \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 A/H1N1, which occurred in 1918\u201319 with a global mortality of at least 20\u201325 million people. It was estimated that 50% of the global population became infected, half of which suffered clinical illnesses. The A/H2N2 pandemic that occurred between 1957 and 1958 caused about 70000 deaths in the US. In 1968, a new type (A/H3N2) emerged and remains in circulation today.",

Subsequent serological studies have shown that human-to-human transmission can occur although the transmission efficiency is low. In 2003, there were another two human cases of H5N1 probably imported from Fujian, mainland China, to Hong Kong. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 has caused further disease outbreaks in poultry in multiple East Asian countries since late 2003. The virus caused fatal human infections in Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. From January 2004 to mid-June 2005, at least 107 cases of human avian H5N1 occurred in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia with reported mortality rates ranging from 46% to 100%.",

These events gave rise to a dominant A/H5N1 genotype (Z) in chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak in 2003\u201304. It appears that domestic ducks in southern China play a central role in the generation and maintenance of this virus. Wild birds may have contributed to the increasingly widespread distribution of the virus in Asia. A/H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential have become endemic in birds in the region and are not easily eradicated. The greatest concern is that there will be reassortment between the current avian A/H5N1 strain and circulating human or porcine influenza viruses, producing a novel, virulent, and readily transmissible human strain. This ecological feature of influenza poses a tremendous threat to public and veterinary health in the region and the world.",

Many patients progress to multiorgan failure involving the lungs, liver, and kidneys with evidence of hemophagocytosis. The primary lesion of experimental A/H5N1 virus in macaques was a severe necrotizing broncho-interstitial pneumonia similar in character and severity to that found in influenza viral pneumonia in humans. Recent reports have indicated that some cases may present with gastrointestinal symptoms initially without any respiratory symptoms, and with rapid progression to encephalitis or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and subsequent death. Asymptomatic infection may occur and this is highlighted by the fact that 10% of poultry workers had positive serology to A/H5N1 and at least one worker who had participated in culling of poultry in Hong Kong in 1997 showed evidence of seroconversion without any symptoms.",
