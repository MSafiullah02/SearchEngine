In the context of evidence-35 based health care and in particular in knowledge synthesis, an expert is someone with excellence in 36 synthesizing evidence. To achieve such expertise, a lot of different skills need to be acquired along 37 with experience in multiple projects. However, the concept of knowledge synthesis should not only 38 be limited to performing different types of reviews (e.g. systematic, scoping, and rapid); it also 39 includes questions of how to make evidence available, and how to communicate findings to the 40 public and decision-makers. All of this is currently extremely important. We need to know where to 41 identify new studies as fast as possible. Based on them, reviews are conducted, whereby many of 42 them may follow methods developed for rapid reviews, which may reduce certainty in their 43 findings. All needs to be communicated fast and to the appropriate decision-makers. The huge 44 challenge for methodological experts is that given the current circumstances, it will frequently not 45 be possible to use the optimal methods for knowledge synthesis, and to balance challenging trade-46 off between optimal methodology and timely results. 47 48",
