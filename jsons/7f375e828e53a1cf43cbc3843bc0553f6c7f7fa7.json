This can often mean that a watch and wait process where no antibiotics are given, is appropriate. Hranjec et al. in a \"before and after study\", found that an aggressive immediate antimicrobial therapy when sepsis was suspected resulted in a more rapid antimicrobial initiation, more frequently inadequate therapy and was associated with a higher mortality as compared to a conservative watch and wait strategy [11] . This study showed that the early initiation of antimicrobial therapy in case of sepsis in ICU can often be delayed after a careful examination of patients and the completion of bacteriological and morphological diagnostic exams. As this study was conducted in a surgical (mainly trauma) ICU with a very low observed mortality, we accept that in many ICUs with the most severely ill and immunocompromised patients, it is by far more difficult not to start an antimicrobial therapy on the suspicion of sepsis [1] .",
