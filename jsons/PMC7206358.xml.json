In total, there were 295,451 emergency episodes in mainland Portugal in the analyzed month; compared with the forecasted value, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency services used. In the analysis by RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes, with around 12,000 fewer episodes than it was forecasted (41% reduction). Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (LVT) presented the highest reduction both in absolute and percentual values, with 111,000 episodes less than it was forecasted (53%). In the analysis by MTS, the elective episodes (white) had the smallest reductions in percentage; all other categories had reductions superior to 30%. The episodes classified as yellow showed the highest decrease (50%), which represents a difference of 121,069 episodes in relation to the expected value for this month.",

These causes for hospitalization can be counterbalanced by other causes that will replace them.
