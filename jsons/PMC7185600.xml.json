One possible explanation is that in our study patients were infants younger than 6 months of age, with a median of 2.6 months, which were attended in their first episode of respiratory infection. Similar results were found by Marguet et al. [9].

This would explain why most of NA1 strains were found during 2010: 14 of 19 strains (73.7%) which also were significantly associated with severe disease. In fact, during 2011, although there was also circulation of NA1, B7 strain was the most prevalent, reducing significantly the severity of disease. Additionally, from 5 infants infected with NA1 in 2011, only one had a severe disease. So, we hypothesized that the emergence of new RSV strains may be associated with severe disease in infants when the general population is still not immune to these new genotypes.",

Kiang et al. found children hospitalized with severe respiratory illnesses, which were infected with genogroup C. In a prospective multicenter study, bronchiolitis in African American infants were more often associated with HRV than other children [6]. In our work, HRV infection was concentrated significantly in patients with mild disease, where strains were distributed homogeneously among the three known genogroups. The co-infection with both RSV and HRV viruses did not correlate with a more severe disease. The rate observed in HRV infection is similar to that reported by other authors. However, the clinical behavior of patients differs depending on the design of the studies. In this study, we have included very young infants, without previous morbidity and in their first episode of ALRTI. In our opinion, these characteristics influence the clinical behavior of studied patients.",

In contrast, in very young infants infected by HRV, the relative immaturity of the immune system may avoid the induction of an intense inflammatory response, as it is seen in older infants or in atopic individuals throughout life. In the future, it will be necessary to compare meticulously the profile of the immune response on different cohorts with rhinovirus infection.",
