Consequently, CAP represents one of the leading causes of infectious admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) [3]. Indeed, the latest studies have reported that up to 10 % of all patients hospitalised with CAP require ICU management [4]. In this specific subgroup of severely ill patients, the overall mortality rate remains unacceptably high despite improvement in critical care management [5]. Furthermore, the medical burden of CAP is very high in terms of direct costs, associated morbidity and long-term disability [6,7].",

Paediatric and adult literature about non-severe pneumococcal pneumonia is abundant, but specific data on patients requiring ICU admission are scarce. In the two studies focusing on the epidemiology of pneumococcal pneumonia among patients admitted to ICU, co-morbidities negatively influenced patient outcomes, but were over-weighted by the severity of the clinical features [9,10]. Recent therapeutic researchers have pointed out that early and adequate antibiotherapy is of greatest importance during sepsis, whereas adjuvant therapies like steroids or activated protein C may reduce the fatality rate [11]. However, the roles of these anti-inflammatory agents, as well as the association with macrolides during severe pneumococcal pneumonia are a matter of debate [12]. Thus, increased knowledge of severe S. pneumoniae pneumonia that may improve early detection and treatment of this particular subgroup carries high interest for ICU physicians.",

If tobacco and alcohol abuse were more frequent in the pneumococcal CAP than in the general population, they did not influence the course of the infection. Similarly, respiratory failure and septic shock were the main admission motives, but they were not independent prognostic variables. In contrast, male gender, age and need for renal replacement therapy were overwhelmingly independent risk factors for mortality. In a set of 43 patients with severe pneumococcal pneumonia, death was driven by organ failure rather than co-morbidity [10]. In another group of 137 ICU patients, Georges et al. showed similar results, except for renal replacement therapy [9]. These authors reported that leucopenia, nosocomial infections and inadequacy of initial antimicrobial therapy were other risk factors for death. In our study, none of these factors were associated with adverse outcomes. Astonishingly, male gender had a major impact on outcome. This is in line with the higher mortality rate of sepsis in male patients despite lower incidence than in female patients [22]. Underlying hormonal-, social- or disease-associated mechanisms remain to be explored to explain these findings [23].",

First, despite prospective data acquisition, there were some missing data, as illustrated by the lack of information about influenza or pneumococcal vaccination or HIV status. Moreover, we did not have access to the time lag between symptom onset and antibiotherapy initiation, which has been proposed as a major outcome determinant [54]. Second, due to the multicentre design, therapeutic strategies (that is, antimicrobial therapy, ventilation protocols and adjunctive therapies) were not standardised. Third, we used the 2001 American Thoracic Society guidelines for severe CAP definition, which included three minor criteria, rather than the 2007 ATS/IDSA definition that includes nine minor criteria [28]. Phua et al. investigated the prognostic value of minor criteria for ICU admission, according to the 2007 guidelines, and found that mortality rose from 0.9% with no risk factors to 35.2% for patients with at least three minor criteria [55]. This underlines the large improvement of determination of prognosis provided with the 2007 criteria, as compared with the initial one that we used. Unfortunately, several of the new minor criteria were not present in our databases. Fourth, we could not study the serotypes of S. pneumoniae in our analysis, and strain specificities seem to be a major element of severity [56]. This requires specific investigations, which were not routinely performed. Similarly, biomarkers such as C-reactive protein or procalcitonin were not available in the databases, whereas routine use of these biomarkers has been shown to improve the triage score for CAP patients in the emergency department [57]. As all our patients were hospitalised in the ICU, the interest of such predictor tools remains to be demonstrated in this population.",
