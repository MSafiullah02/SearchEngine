Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is defined as SE that continues despite administration of both benzodiazepines and an appropriately dosed second-line antiseizure drug. Depending on the semiology of the seizures and comorbidities of the patient, this stage may be treated with further antiseizure drugs or anesthesia. When seizures recur upon weaning the anesthetic agent, typically after 24 h of seizure suppression, or in the rare cases where seizure control cannot be achieved with anesthesia, status epilepticus is considered to be super refractory (SRSE). The incidence of status epilepticus has been increasing, from 3.5 to 12.5/100,000 population between 1979 and 2010. During this time hospital mortality has not changed [1] .",

These delineations have treatment implications. Convulsive seizures are easily recognized and must be controlled emergently. At the refractory stage of convulsive SE, the standard treatment is anesthesia which is highly effective at achieving seizure suppression. The semiology of nonconvulsive status epilepticus is highly varied and thus may be diagnosed after some delay when seizures are identified on the electroencephalogram (EEG) with limited or fluctuating clinical correlates. Patients may have subtle behavioral changes, confusion, or automatisms as well as an altered level of consciousness. Patients in NCSE may exhibit subtle rhythmic jerks, eye fluttering, or gaze deviation. The optimal treatment of refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus is not well established. Compared with focal status epilepticus, generalized status epilepticus may warrant more aggressive treatment. Yet, paradoxically, both focal motor seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus predict development of refractoriness [3] . Forty percent of generalized convulsive SE evolves into nonconvulsive status epilepticus by the time anesthetic agents are initiated [4] . Nonconvulsive seizures after control of convulsions should be suspected in patients who do not regain consciousness within 15-30 min of the cessation of convulsions. While certain variables may suggest a prolonged postictal period, such as high doses of benzodiazepines or barbiturates or underlying cognitive impairment or structural brain disease in the setting of prolonged convulsions, these are unreliable, and only EEG can ensure adequate seizure control in this setting.",

Receptor trafficking with an increase in glutamatergic receptors and a reduction in GABA receptors is thought to contribute to pharmacoresistance and perpetuation of seizures.

RSE which develops in the absence of underlying epilepsy is most commonly due to acute encephalitis, stroke, brain tumor, traumatic brain injury, or drug or alcohol withdrawal. Myoclonic status resulting from hypoxic ischemic injury will be discussed in Chap. 18. A more comprehensive list of etiologies is shown in Table 2 .

The patient should be examined for signs of trauma, meningismus, and focal neurological deficits. In nearly all episodes of status epilepticus, a comprehensive laboratory evaluation including antiseizure drug levels, serum electrolytes, glucose level, urine and serum toxicology screens, troponin, lactate and creatine kinase levels, and a head computed tomography (CT) scan is warranted. Because cardiopulmonary complications are commonly associated with status epilepticus, a screening chest X-ray and electrocardiogram would aid in evaluation for aspiration, ischemic changes or development of a prolonged QTc, or other stress-related changes. When laboratory evaluation and neuroimaging do not yield an etiology for SRSE, workup continues with CSF analysis for infection and autoimmune and paraneoplastic conditions. This basic workup will identify the most common causes of SE. In addition to this evaluation, mitochondrial studies are occasionally conducted in younger patients.

Less established options include levetiracetam and lacosamide. Anesthetics should be considered once second-line medications fail [5] . Clinicians should progress through this protocol rapidly in convulsive status epilepticus where it is not advisable to await completion of the second-line agent to begin intubation, initiation of mechanical ventilation, and induction of an anesthetic drug. In nonconvulsive seizure types, it is often reasonable to await true failure of the second-line agent or even trial a third-or fourth-line non-anesthetic antiseizure drug prior to committing the patient to anesthesia.

Type and duration of status, premorbid APACHE 2 scores, anesthetic choice, and even age have not been shown to reliably influence prognosis [10] . Although age is a well-known predictor in SE, it is not shown to be a strong predictor in RSE or SRSE. The variation in mortality estimates in various studies likely stem from the studies' length of follow-up, the use of anesthetics, the ratio of convulsive vs NCSE, and the variable exclusion of myoclonic status due to hypoxic ischemic injury.",

As previously mentioned, SRSE due to AED noncompliance in patients with pre-existing epilepsy has the lowest mortality at 4 %. Patients with NMDA encephalitis produce NMDA antibodies which are not destructive to the CNS. Therefore, these patients may have a favorable outcome despite months of SRSE. On the other hand, SRSE as a result of glioblastoma multiforme or progression of mitochondrial disease portend a poor prognosis. Convulsive SE is thought to foreshadow a worse prognosis than NCSE [10] . This has been postulated to be due to more excitotoxic injury to the brain as well as increased systemic complications due to the massive sympathetic outpouring during the convulsions. Prolonged convulsive seizures are undoubtedly taxing to the body with excessive lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis and secondary renal failure, aspiration pneumonia, as well as cardiopulmonary stress.",

A significant minority of survivors (22 %) are able to achieve independence [17] , and 10 % return to their premorbid functional status [17] . The high mortality rates in SRSE patients are largely driven by either changes in the goals of care or complications of treatment and critical illness. Therefore, the relationship between duration of SRSE and outcome might be a result of accumulating systemic complications rather than the seizure itself.

Progressive atrophy is apparent at 1 month and 2 months after onset of status epilepticus discharges localized independently in the left frontal, right and left frontotemporal, and occipital head regions. These findings were consistent with a widespread encephalopathic etiology. The patient exhibited a number of clinical features such as pelvic thrusting that were not directly correlated in time with the discharges. This electromechanical dissociation suggested a subcortical as opposed to cerebral origin for these clinical features. Given the continued electrographic seizures and clinical events, phenobarbital was administered, leading to a discontinuous, and in her case, burst-suppression pattern (Fig. 2) . Despite treatment with several anticonvulsants and phenobarbital administration, seizures continued to occur. A left temporal seizure discharge is noted in Fig. 3 . Quantitative EEG trending software facilitates following efficacy of therapy. The quantitative EEG in this patient (Fig. 3) indicated that seizures were continuing to occur at a rate of 4 per hour.

A CT head showed a large subdural hematoma with the right frontal and temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Following successful drainage of the subdural hematoma, the patient was noted to be intermittently mute. In addition, nursing staff noted the patient to exhibit intermittent jerking of the left face, thumb, and fingers. An emergency EEG showed polyphasic periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (\"poly-PLEDs\") over the right posterior temporal-occipital region. Poly-PLEDs are typically present in acute or subacute conditions as opposed to chronic focal cerebral lesions. Over time, the area of cerebral damage gives rise to more synchronous discharges, and poly-PLEDs may evolve to less complex biphasic or triphasic PLEDs. This EEG was also notable for the presence of iterative discharges seen in the same derivations as the poly-PLEDs. PLEDs occurring in association with iterative discharges are referred to as \"PLEDs plus.\" Clinical seizures occur at a higher prevalence in patients with PLED plus compared to those with PLEDs alone. Prolonged EEG monitoring should be considered in patients with PLEDs plus, given the risk of subclinical electrographic seizures in these cases. In addition to poly-PLEDs and PLEDs plus, frequent electrographic and clinical seizures were present in this patient, justifying a diagnosis of focal NCSE. He was conscious in between seizures and had not required ventilator support. Non-sedating therapies for status epilepticus were utilized initially including levetiracetam, phenytoin, lacosamide, and low-dose lorazepam, which were unsuccessful. An IV infusion of phenobarbital at a subanesthetic dosage of 5 mg/kg resulted in definitive suppression of seizures in this case.",

Risk factors for refractoriness include traumatic brain injury, stroke, encephalitis, brain tumors, AED noncompliance in patients with epilepsy, and drug intoxication or withdrawal. Apart from etiology, there are no reliable predictors of outcome. In addition to the established treatment, there are several alternative or adjunctive treatment options that have anecdotal success but remain poorly studied. Mortality is generally due to transition to palliative care or complications related to treatment. Prognosis can be favorable in up to 20 % of patients despite weeks or months of seizures.",
