            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly infectious disease of the upper-respiratory tract in chickens (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). It can also affect the kidneys and reproductive tract. It is of economic importance to the poultry industry due to the high morbidity and production losses associated with the disease. The etiologic agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. The virus contains four structural proteins; nucleocapsid surrounding the viral RNA, an integral membrane glycoprotein, a small envelope protein, and a spike glycoprotein located on the surface of the viral envelope, which contains epitopes that induce virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies.",

Therefore, it is imperative to quickly and accurately detect the presence of the virus within an infected poultry flock so that subsequent flocks can be properly vaccinated. It is also important to rapidly differentiate IBV infections from other upper-respiratory diseases like avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectious laryngotracheitis, and avian mycoplasmosis so that appropriate measures against those diseases can be taken in a timely manner.",

            "text": "Current diagnostic assays for IBV include virus isolation in embryonating eggs, tracheal organ culture, or cell culture immunoassays, and molecular assays that detect the viral RNA (Gelb and Jackwood, 1998). Virus isolation is considered the reference standard; however, it is expensive and time consuming because several passages may be required to detect the virus. Immunoassays use IBV-specific monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus in direct or indirect fluorescent antibody and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats. Although faster and simpler than virus isolation, immunoassays tend to lack specificity and sensitivity and none detect all strains or types of IBV (Karaca and Naqi, 1993, Karaca et al., 1992, Naqi et al., 1993). Molecular assays for the detection of IBV are commonly used because they provide highly specific and sensitive results in a timely manner. Molecular assays use the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA directly from a clinical sample or from virus isolated in a laboratory host system. When RT-PCR is used to amplify the spike glycoprotein of IBV, it can be coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or nucleic acid sequencing to identify the type of the virus (Cavanagh et al., 1990, Jackwood et al., 1997, Keeler et al., 1998, Kingham et al., 2000, Kwon et al., 1993).",

Transcripts were generated from a plasmid containing the first \u223c5500 bp of the Mass 41 genome of IBV downstream of a T7 promoter, which was created using the 5\u2032-primer A-Beau U30 (5\u2032-TACACTAGCCTTGCGCTAGA-3\u2032) and 3\u2032-primer A-Beau L5447 (5\u2032-GCACGCCAAAGTCCCATAG-3\u2032). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the Mass 41 strain of IBV using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics Corporation). The purified RNA was resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water and used in the RT-PCR reaction as previously described (Jackwood et al., 1997, Lee and Jackwood, 2001). The amplified product was cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer's directions and sequenced to verify its accuracy. The plasmid was linearized at base pair 735 relative to the start of the genome with Xmn I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The linearized DNA was gel purified and used as template with a RiboMax T7 In Vitro Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI) per the manufacturer's recommendations. The length of the runoff RNA transcripts was verified by agarose gel analysis, and the concentration was determined using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Ten-fold serial dilutions of the runoff RNA transcripts containing 2 \u00d7 106 to 2 \u00d7 101 copies of template per microliter were made and 5 \u03bcL of each dilution was used as template in the assay. The limit of detection/quantification and reproducibility of the assay were determined by six independent runs. The limit of detection was defined as the lowest RNA concentration yielding a C\nT value where the fluorescence of the reaction exceeded 30 U of fluorescence. The limit of quantification was defined as the lowest RNA concentration on the standard curve that maintained linearity. The average number of IBV genome copies for each group of experimental samples was estimated using the equation derived from the standard curve.",

It also amplified the 5\u2032-UTR of two strains of TCoV. This result was not unexpected because TCoV is closely related to IBV and likely arose from a recombination event within the spike glycoprotein gene (Guy, 2000, Jackwood et al., 2004).

The window of time that IBV can be detected following infection with the real-time RT-PCR test described herein is 21 days post-infection, which likely represents a significant improvement over virus isolation and explains the higher rate of detection in the tracheal swab samples. For virus isolation, it is generally recommended that tissues such as cecal tonsil and kidney or cloacal swabs be taken in addition to tracheal swabs because the virus is known to persist there (Gelb and Jackwood, 1998). Not only does that practice significantly increases the work load it also can yield misleading results because vaccine viruses can also persist in those tissues and be shed in the feces (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003).",

More studies will be necessary to determine the course of virus replication in vivo, but it appears that the tracheal epithelium can support a finite amount of virus and that virus replication continues until that limit is reached. For the dosages used in our study, the maximum level of viral load was reached within 5 days post-infection. It is interesting to note and quite appropriate that the requirements for efficacy of IBV vaccines outlined in section 113.327 Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_99/9cfr113_99.html) requires that detection of challenge virus be conducted 5 d.p.i. We also observed that the level of viral RNA in the trachea of birds, which received a high dose of virus, declined more quickly than levels in birds receiving a low dose of the virus. Loss of ciliated columnar epithelium and presumably the associated virus replicating in those cells, is a common lesion with IBV infection. Birds receiving a high dose of IBV can develop clinical signs and lesions within 24 h, whereas natural spreading virus generally requires 36 h or more before clinical signs and lesions occur (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Presumably, high dosages of the virus would accelerate the loss of the epithelial cells in the upper-respiratory tract leading to a more rapid decline in viral load.",

Our data indicates that approximately half of the birds in the flock were initially exposed to the vaccine (day 3 post-vaccination data), which then spread to other birds in the flock so that by 14 days post-vaccination, more than 80% were exposed. More data will be required to verify this result, but it appears that exposure to IBV vaccine by in-house spray vaccination could be improved. Initially it could be considered advantageous for IBV vaccines to spread in a marginally exposed flock providing a mechanism for all the birds in the flock to become immunized, however; vaccine spread in a flock also presents opportunities for back passage of these rapidly mutating coronaviruses potentially leading to a reversion to pathogenicity.",
