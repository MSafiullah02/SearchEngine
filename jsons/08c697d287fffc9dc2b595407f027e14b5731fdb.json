Animal studies investigating the effects of RAS blockade in a range of conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, functional gut disorders, gastrointestinal malignancy and even intestinal ischaemia have been encouraging to date.

The contemporary view of the RAS has evolved from that of a simple linear pathway involving the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin II (Ang II) via a two-step process facilitated by renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), to a much more complex system involving homologues of ACE and multiple angiotensin peptides which play supplementary and counter-regulatory roles ( Figure 1 ). The RAS was, for many years, thought of as an endocrine system with enzymes and peptides released into the systemic circulation to act on target organs. More recently, it has been recognised that most organs including the brain, kidney, heart, liver, pancreas, reproductive organs, skin and the gastrointestinal tract constitutively express all the components required to allow autonomous function of a local intra-organ RAS, where it performs both paracrine and autocrine functions. Table 1 summarises the current view of the RAS, the key components and their physiological and clinical effects. Essentially, the relative activity of two counterbalancing pathways determines the predominant tissue effect.",

Both renin and its proenzyme prorenin, which was previously considered physiologically inactive, 1 have now been demonstrated to have independent pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects via signalling through the pro(renin) receptor (PRR). 2 The classical RAS comprising the zinc metalloproteinase ACE and Ang II induces vasoconstriction, salt and Figure 1 | The contemporary renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

            "text": "Chymase expressed in the heart and vascular wall and secreted by activated mast cells, acts as an alternative enzyme to ACE to generate Ang II from Ang I. 3-6 NEP, a membrane bound zinc metalloproteinase with a structure distinct from ACE, was discovered in the 1970s as a key enzyme involved in the cleavage of bradykinin. 7, 8 In recent years, it has been shown to also have a role in the formation of Ang (1-7) from Ang I, as an inactivator of atrial natriuretic peptide 9 and in the degradation of amyloid b peptide, 10 a protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The net effect of NEP inhibition is vasodilatation and natriuresis, a property encompassed by vasopeptidase inhibitors that target both ACE and NEP and may have additional anti-hypertensive effects to ACE inhibitors. 11 In contrast, the alternative RAS, comprising ACE2 and Ang (1-7), acting via the G-protein coupled seventransmembrane receptor mas, 12, 13 has vasodilatory, antihypertensive, anti-thrombotic, cardioprotective, antiinflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in a variety of tissues. 14-18 ACE2 is a zinc metalloproteinase and homologue of ACE, which cleaves a single amino acid from Ang II to form the heptapeptide Ang (1-7). Indeed, part of the clinical benefit attributed to ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers (ARBs) may be through the diversion of the classical RAS components towards Ang (1-7) with subsequent mas receptor activation. [18] [19] [20] The complexity of the RAS is further highlighted by recent findings regarding the actions of other angiotensin peptides including angiotensin III [Ang III, also denoted as Ang (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) ], angiotensin IV [Ang IV, also known as Ang (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) ] and the AT2 and AT4 receptors. Ang III is formed by cleavage of Ang II by aminopeptidase A, and Ang IV results from further conversion by aminopeptidase B or N ( Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "The AT2 receptor (AT2R) has affinity for Ang II, Ang III, Ang IV and Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , and is also thought to have effects counteracting the AT1R and analogous to those of the mas receptor, with vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative downstream actions. Previously recognised largely for an important role in foetal development, more recently, the AT2R has been shown to be upregulated in atherosclerotic disease, 21 cutaneous wounds 22 and pancreatic fibrosis, 23 and to stimulate neurite outgrowth, a marker of neuronal regeneration. 24, 25 Ang III is believed to have actions analogous to Ang II. Ang IV appears to have opposing effects to Ang II, and acts predominantly via the AT2R and the AT4R, formerly known as insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). 26 The greatest role of Ang IV is in the central nervous system (CNS), where it has a positive effect on neuronal development, learning and memory. 27, 28 CONCEPT OF LOCAL RAS There is considerable evidence that most or all of the components of the RAS are present in a variety of organs, supporting the theory that local expression and modulation of the RAS play important roles in tissue homeostasis. These roles may be summarised as involving (1) fluid and electrolyte transport, (2) regional blood flow regulation and (3) promoting the wound healing response, including cell proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis. Some of the regional effects of the RAS are listed below:",

This may influence blood pressure independent of systemic Ang II levels and vascular tone. 29, 30 (ii) The heart expresses renin, PRR, ACE, chymase, angiotensinogen, AT1R and AT2R, and these components modulate myocyte proliferation and cardiac remodelling. 6, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] (iii) The brain has been shown to express renin, angiotensinogen, Ang II, Ang III, Ang IV, Ang (1-7), AT1R, AT2R and AT4R, with these components regulating blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance, thirst, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and neuronal development including learning and memory processes. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] (iv) The liver expresses renin, angiotensinogen, Ang II, ACE, AT1R, Ang (1-7), ACE2 and mas receptors, all of which are upregulated in the diseased liver. 45, 46 Furthermore, ARBs and Ang (1-7) have been demonstrated to reduce liver fibrosis in animal models. [47] [48] [49] (v) In the pancreas, Ang II has been shown to inhibit glucose stimulated insulin secretion, and via AT1R and AT2R, regulates exocrine enzyme secretion and the microcirculation. [50] [51] [52] (vi) A local RAS has been identified and shown to be involved in tissue homeostasis in the reproductive organs, skin and even adipose tissue. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] Detailed reviews of these and other local RAS effects are published elsewhere. 12, 30, 50, 54, [59] [60] [61] LOCALISATION AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE RAS IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Our understanding of the involvement of the RAS in the gastrointestinal tract has gradually evolved over the past five decades since the formulation of the hypothesis that Ang II had a direct effect on intestinal smooth muscle in addition to an indirect effect via myenteric plexus cholinergic neurons. [62] [63] [64] Since then, many of the components of the RAS have been identified throughout the gastrointestinal tract. An overview of the current state of knowledge is illustrated in Figure 2 . The regions of the gut are addressed separately here.",

[81] [82] [83] When applied in low dose to rat jejunum, Ang II stimulates sodium and water absorption through AT2R, but in high dose, it unexpectedly inhibits absorption through AT1R. 84 Both Ang II and Ang III may also increase sodium and water absorption via stimulation of release of noradrenaline from sympathetic neurons, which in turn may act through adrenergic receptors on the basal surface of epithelial cells. 83, 85, 86 (iii) Glucose absorption: Ang II has also been shown to inhibit rat jejunal sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1)-mediated glucose uptake in vitro. 77 (iv) Digestion and absorption of peptides: Both brush border ACE and ACE2 are thought to function as peptidases, allowing for mucosal digestion and absorption of peptides. 87, 88 ACE2 increases the activity of the neutral amino acid transporter B 0 AT1, which is mutated in a rare amino acid deficiency disorder, Hartnup disorder, clinically manifested by cerebellar ataxia and pellagra-like skin rash. 89 (v) Secretion: A role for ACE2 in active secretion has been suggested by the observation that ACE2 is the target for the coronavirus mediating severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV. Some patients with this infection suffer from watery diarrhoea, but the exact mechanism remains to be determined. 66 ",

A more limited range of functional roles has been attributed to components of the RAS in the colon than in small intestine.

NEP knockout mice have been shown to have more severe colitis in response to dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid than wild-type mice, which is prevented by the administration of recombinant NEP. 118 Other evidence to suggest that RAS dysfunction may potentiate immune-based diseases such as IBD and provide a target for therapy comes from recent studies involving models for multiple sclerosis (MS).

[130] [131] [132] In mouse models, ACE inhibition and ARBs reduced colorectal cancer liver metastases 133 and prolonged survival in peritoneal carcinomatosis. 128 Indeed, ACE inhibitor use independently protected against distal metastasis in a single centre retrospective review of patients with colorectal carcinoma. 134 Also, patients treated with ACE inhibitors had a non-significant trend towards reduction in risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in a retrospective study of the UK general practice research database. 135 Recently, there have been intriguing insights into the involvement of the RAS in Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS). Shorning and colleagues have shown that in mice LKB1 gene deletion, which is associated with PJS, results in marked transcriptional upregulation of the renin gene Ren1, and also increased ACE expression and Ang II production. 70 In human PJS tumour tissue, AT1R was noted to be increased in stromal tissue, but reduced in the epithelium. 70 Gut motility disorders The functional role of the RAS in smooth muscle contraction suggests that it might be a target in motility dysfunction. For example, the ability of Ang II blockade to inhibit contraction of oesophageal body and lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) smooth muscle, together with the demonstrated reduction in the amplitude of contraction of primary peristaltic oesophageal waves and LES on manometry in vivo, 100 suggests a possible role in treatment of hypercontractile oesophageal disorders such as diffuse oesophageal spasm, nutcracker oesophagus and achalasia. Furthermore, selective AT1R-mediated contraction of the LES may be an option for treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, a condition that affects up to 15-20% of the population. 136 The contribution of AT1R to small and large intestinal muscle contractility also provides an opportunity to intervene in functional intestinal and motility disorders through AT1R agonism or blockade. Furthermore, the role of ACE and ACE2 in intestinal fluid and electrolyte absorption suggests a potential mechanism for modulating fluid shifts across the brush border, with subsequent effects on stool consistency and frequency.",

In acute hypovolaemia and systemic sepsis, splanchnic vasoconstriction occurs as a homeostatic response to preserve cerebral and renal blood flow, predisposing the gut to ischaemia. This splanchnic response has been shown to correlate with a markedly increased expression of Ang II. 137 Furthermore, lower-body negative pressure induction in normal human volunteers has also been shown to raise serum Ang II and reduce intestinal mucosal nitric oxide production. 138 The administration of candesartan maintained jejunal and mucosal perfusion during severe hypovolaemia in pigs and reduced mortality. 139, 140 A further porcine study reported improved mucosal oxygen delivery, but not an improvement in intestinal mucosal acidosis in pigs administered candesartan during endotoxic shock. 141 These results were replicated by Tardos et al. in pigs with burn and endotoxin induced gut ischaemia. In this model, intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation were reduced with the administration of the Ang II inhibitor DuP753. 142 The obvious limiting factor in applying Ang II blockade in humans at risk of mesenteric ischaemia is the potential for current ARBs and ACE inhibitors to cause further hypotension and kidney injury, although no adverse renal consequences were noted in one porcine study. 139 MANIPULATION OF LOCAL GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT RAS -POTENTIAL TARGETS AND LIMITATIONS As a ubiquitous system with a wide array of homeostatic roles, investigation into therapies that manipulate the RAS has been extensive. Apart from the well-established roles of AT1 receptor blockade and ACE inhibition in the treatment of hypertension, cardiovascular and kidney disease, new drugs targeting the mas receptor, AT2 receptor, AT4R, renin and NEP, as well as a recombinant Ang (1-7), are under trial for various applications ( Table 2) .",
