It is unclear if outcome in trauma patients differs as well. Therefore, this study aims to determine differences in characteristics, therapy and outcome of trauma patients between both German-speaking countries. Methods The TraumaRegister DGU \u00ae (TR-DGU) was used. Patients with Injury Severity Score \u2265 9 admitted to a level 1 trauma centre between 01/2009 and 12/2017 were included if they required ICU care or died. Trauma pattern, pre-hospital procedures and outcome were compared between Swiss (CH, n = 4768) and German (DE, n = 66,908) groups. Results Swiss patients were older than German patients (53 vs. 50 years). ISS did not differ between groups (CH 23.8 vs. DE 23.0 points). There were more low falls < 3 m (34% vs. 21%) at the expense of less traffic accidents (37% vs. 52%) in the Swiss population. In Switzerland 30% of allocations were done without physician involvement, whereas this occurred in 4% of German cases. Despite a comparable number of patients with a GCS \u2264 8 (CH 29.6%; DE 26.4%), differences in prehospital intubation rates occurred (CH 31% vs. DE 40%). Severe traumatic brain injuries were diagnosed most frequently in Switzerland (CH 62% vs. DE 49%). Admission vital signs were similar, and standardized mortality ratios were close to one in both countries. Conclusion This study demonstrates that patients' age, trauma patterns and pre-hospital care differ between Germany and Switzerland. However, adjusted mortality was almost similar. Further benchmarking studies are indicated to optimize trauma care in both German-speaking countries.",

This registry was founded in 1993. The aim of this multi-centre database is a pseudonymized and standardized documentation of severely injured patients. Data are collected prospectively in four consecutive time phases from the site of the accident until discharge from hospital: (A) pre-hospital phase, (B) emergency room and initial surgery, (C) intensive care unit and (D) discharge. The documentation includes detailed information on demographics, injury pattern, comorbidities, pre-and in-hospital management, course on intensive care unit, relevant laboratory findings including data on transfusion and outcome of each individual. The inclusion criteria are admission to hospital via emergency room with subsequent ICU/ICM care, or hospital arrival with vital signs and death before admission to ICU. The infrastructure for documentation, data management and data analysis is provided by AUC-Academy for Trauma Surgery (AUC-Akademie der Unfallchirurgie GmbH), a company affiliated to the German Trauma Society. The scientific leadership is provided by the Committee on Emergency Medicine, Intensive Care and Trauma Management (Section NIS) of the German Trauma Society. The participating hospitals submit their data pseudonymized into a central database via a Web-based application. Scientific data analysis is approved according to a peer review procedure laid down in the publication guideline of TR-DGU. The participating hospitals are primarily located in Germany (90%), but a rising number of hospitals of other countries contribute data as well (at the moment from Austria, Belgium, China, Finland, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates). Currently, approximately 33,000 cases from more than 650 hospitals are entered into the database per year. Participation in TraumaRegister DGU \u00ae is voluntary. For hospitals associated with TraumaNetzwerk DGU \u00ae , however, the entry of at least a basic data set is obligatory for reasons of quality assurance. A detailed description of the structure and quality control of the registry is available online: https ://www. traum aregi ster-dgu.de.",

Pre-hospital intubation is frequently associated with altered neurological status and more specifically a reduced initial GCS score. Even though similar proportions of cases with an initial GCS < 9 were documented in both cohorts, intubation rates were lower in the Swiss cohort. One can assume that the paramedicbased allocation system in Switzerland leads to a lower intubation rate. As success rates of pre-hospital intubation are higher in physicians compared to non-physicians, it is likely that paramedics are more reluctant to intubate patients [21] . Thereby, the findings of the current study underline the benefits of emergency physician presence (reflected by higher intubation rates in the German cohort) in the treatment of craniocerebral injuries. Increased intubation rates may partly explain enhanced outcome observed in neurotrauma patients treated by emergency physicians compared with treatment systems with lower pre-hospital emergency physician attendance [22, 23] .",

In contrast, more liberal fluid administration protocols, as utilized in Germany, lead to a slight decrease of hypovolemic patients as they are diagnosed on the spot (13.0%) and subsequently admitted to the hospital (11.8%). Thereby, more liberal pre-hospital fluid administration seems to be associated with more adequate restoration of hemodynamics during the pre-hospital phase. This is, however, in contrast with the present heavily propagated principles of limited volume resuscitation and permissive hypotension in trauma [26, 27] . Furthermore, a slightly higher percentage of patients in the German population received > 10 units of erythrocyte concentrate transfusions than the Swiss population, despite equal admission hemoglobin levels and coagulation status. This is most likely due to the larger fraction of patients with impaired hemodynamic status (reflected by SBP < 90 mmHg on admission) in the German cohort than in the Swiss group. Nevertheless, it may also suggest different transfusion habits between both countries, especially, as transfusion habits in certain Swiss-level-one trauma centers changed markedly within the last decade [28] . Swiss transfusion rates probably dropped due to the implementation of a goal-directed coagulation algorithm, and increasing utilization of tranexamic acid and coagulation factor XIII [28, 29] .",
