Patients' laboratory examinations included normal or reduced leukocyte count, reduced lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated creatine kinase, and elevated myoglobin. Reduced lymphocyte count can occur in some severe cases.\n2\n At present, there is no effective therapy for COVID\u201019. Therefore, the group of diseases and the assessment of prognosis become more and more important.\n3\n The severity of diseases was according to the COVID\u201019 diagnosis and treatment scheme issued by the National Health Committee.

Compared with SARS, they both are caused by human coronavirus infection. Although there are significant differences between 2019\u2010nCOV and SARS\u2010CoV in genetic characteristics, there are still many similarities in physical and chemical characteristics.\n5\n, \n8\n A retrospective analysis of SARS patients showed that 68% to 90% of diagnosed patients had peripheral lymphocytopenia, 20% to 45% had thrombocytopenia, and 20% to 34% had leukopenia.\n9\n Platelets are important immune cells in the human body, which play an important role in hemostasis, coagulation, vascular integrity maintenance, angiogenesis, innate immunity, inflammatory response, tumor biology and so on. Changes in its number and activity are closely related to a variety of diseases.\n10\n, \n11\n Platelets are produced by mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, and current studies have shown that a variety of cytokines, including TPO, IL\u20103, IL\u20106, IL\u20109, IL\u201011, and stem cell factor (SCF), can promote the production of megakaryocytes. In vitro experiments, the addition of mixed cytokines can stimulate the generation of megakaryocytes. SCF plays an important role in promoting the proliferation of megakaryocytes at the early stage of differentiation, while IL\u20103 and TP0 play a synergistic role in the differentiation of megakaryocytes. In state of inflammation, IL\u20106 can promote the generation of megakaryocytes by stimulating the increase of TPO level.\n12\n, \n15\n The absolute value of lymphocytes and platelet levels can be used as sensitive indicators to reflect the body's infection and inflammation control.

Injury of lung tissue and pulmonary endothelial cells can lead to activation, aggregation, and retention of platelets in the lung, and the formation of thrombus at the injured site, which may lead to the depletion of platelets and megakaryocytes, resulting in decreased platelet production and increased consumption.\n20\n, \n21\n (c) Huang et al\n22\n believed that patients with COVID\u201019 had a large amount of IL\u20101, IFN\u2010\u03b3, IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, and other cytokines released, which may lead to Th1 activation. However, compared with nonsevere patients, severe cases had higher concentrations of cytokines such as G\u2010CSF, IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, MIP\u20101, and TNF\u2010\u03b1, suggesting that cytokine storm is related to the severity of the disease. However, unlike SARS\u2010CoV infection, 2019\u2010nCoV infection also causes increased secretion of Th2 cytokines that inhibit Th1, such as IL\u20104 and IL\u201010. In our results, in severe cases, the platelet significantly increased during treatment, which may be linked to the release of a large number of cytokines by the immune system. Infection with 2019\u2010nCoV causes cytokine storms in body fluids, aggravating the patient's inflammatory response and stimulating the release of platelets, which often indicates a poor prognosis.\n23\n, \n24\n Of course, if the conditions permit, high\u2010throughput cytokine detection for COVID\u201019 patients to judge whether they are over immune activated, it will be very convincing. However, because there is no 3P laboratory in the Huizhou area that can send such special infected blood samples for examination, so the testing for this item has to be abandoned. The difference is not founded from the analysis of simple blood routine numerical data. It is hoped that the future research direction is the correlation between blood routine changes and cytokines. The correlation between cytokine storm severity and prognosis may be one of the mechanisms of COVID\u201019, which is involved in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of COVID\u201019, providing a new idea for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n25\n, \n26\n However, there are many factors that affect platelet changes in the clinic. All patients in this study did not use invasive procedures such as tracheal intubation and deep vein catheterization. Therefore, the impact of invasive procedures on platelet changes was not considered in this article.\n27\n It can be seen from the foregoing that the use of hormones during the treatment of patients is not significantly different between severe and nonsevere patients, so their effects on platelets can also be ruled out.",

            "text": "As a new type of inflammation index, PLR mainly reflects the level of systemic inflammation. Previous studies have confirmed that PLR is closely related to tumors, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and connective tissue diseases, and the increase of PLR is related to tumor size, lymph node infiltration, distant metastasis and prognosis, and can be used as a potential inflammatory indicator for the clinical diagnosis of community\u2010acquired pneumonia.\n28\n As an indicator of inflammation, PLR is mainly caused by megakaryocytes in bone marrow hematopoietic tissue and is a major participant in thrombosis. It plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response to recruit neutrophils and other inflammatory cells to the site of injury. PLT exists in an inactive form and can be activated quickly at the site of vascular injury, and can be rapidly activated in response to proinflammatory cytokine or infectious factors. The activation of platelets by this mechanism, even without any vascular damage, opens up new functions of platelets, namely inflammation and immune regulation, and the proinflammatory cytokine activity of PLT is mediated by its interaction with other leukocytes in the circulation, followed by the release of cytokines and chemokine to promote inflammation.\n29\n Lymphocytes are the main immune\u2010active cells in the human body, and lymphocyte count is an early marker of physiological stress and systemic inflammation. Platelet\u2010released platelet factor\u20104 can prevent agglutinin\u2010A from inhibiting lymphocyte generation, and activated platelets enhance lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium, thereby promoting lymphocyte homing in endothelial veins and migration to inflammatory sites. PLR refers to the ratio of the platelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte count. The advantage of PLR selection is that it reflects both aggregation and inflammatory pathways, and maybe more valuable in predicting various inflammations than platelet or lymphocyte counts alone.",

According to prior analysis, we propose the PLR as an indicator which reflects the severity of inflammation in the process of treatment, by comparing the changes of PLR during treatment, we found that the higher the \u0394PLR, the longer the hospital stay they were, of which showed a linear correlation. Therefore, we speculated that the changes in the platelet/lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood during treatment could reflect the disease progression and prognosis of COVID\u201019 patients. The larger the \u0394PLR, the more severe the cytokine storm, and the longer the hospital stay, the worse the prognosis. When \u0394PLR increases in severe patients, we increase thymosin to regulate immune to elevate lymphocyte therapy to improve this situation, to prevent the development of severe patients or promote the improvement of symptoms in severe patients. After active symptomatic treatment, all three severe patients were successfully treated and successfully discharged from the hospital! The results of this treatment also seem to confirm our conjecture. We also calculated the cut\u2010off value of \u0394PLR. When \u0394PLR > 126.7, we must actively intervene to prevent further deterioration of the disease. However, due to the lack of clinical data, this conclusion may be biased, and a larger number of samples are needed for further confirmation.",
