In Taiwan, healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA), which can cause life-threatening infections, has become endemic in hospitals [4]. A government policy restricting the use of antibiotics was established by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) and was implemented in 2001 in Taiwan [4]. A few studies have evaluated the short-term relationship between consumption of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan hospitals [9], [13], [14] before and after implementation of this policy.",

Briefly, the hospital distributed and implemented an infection control manual with specific protocols for prevention of infection by various routes (e.g. airborne and droplets); analysed incidences of infection with MRSA and other multidrug-resistant infections; performed active surveillance, reporting of notifiable infectious diseases and isolation of patients; performed surveillance and screening of healthcare workers (HCWs); trained HCWs in the appropriate use of personal protective equipment; provided continuing education programmes for HCWs; promoted hand hygiene; analysed the use of antibiotics and presented workshops on appropriate use of antibiotics; and adopted the measures for control, monitoring and review of antibiotic use described below.",

Although prescriptions for some restricted antibiotics required prior authorisation by infectious disease specialists (IDSs), most antibiotics were freely prescribed without documentation of indications or limitations on the duration of use. In 2000, the CSMU Infection Control Committee and Department of Pharmacy established a new antibiotic use policy with the following provisions. Restricted and unrestricted antimicrobials were clearly classified. The restricted antimicrobials included \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors and penicillin plus \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination (sulbactam sodium, ampicillin/sulbactam injection, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid injection and piperacillin/tazobactam), second-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime and cefmetazole), third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and flomoxef), fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome), carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin), aminoglycosides (amikacin and isepamicin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin. Furthermore, the indications for use of restricted antimicrobials became regulated by the BNHI in Taiwan and three important new regulations restricting antimicrobial use were implemented. Inappropriate prophylactic use of antibiotics for surgery was discouraged, for example by limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy to 3 days in some clean surgeries, e.g. total hip replacement, total knee replacement and coronary artery bypass graft. Antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections were restricted. The 10 guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in Taiwan can be freely downloaded from http://www.ejmii.com/guidelines.php to use as a reference.",

Furthermore, prescriptions for restricted antibiotics required authorisation from an IDS. Criteria that defined the need for consultation and authorisation by an IDS include use of restricted antibiotics, use of more than two different classes of antibiotics or use of antibiotics for longer than 7 days as well as the requested assessment of appropriate antibiotic use. The role of the IDSs in the antibiotic use programme is crucial. IDSs assess the appropriate use of antimicrobials and provide recommendations according to patient's clinical symptoms and signs, diagnosis, liver and renal function, co-morbidities, culture susceptibility tests and adherence to guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in Taiwan. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is discontinued. IDSs permit appropriate antibiotic agents for 7 days after assessment and consent.",

Consumption of all antibacterials for systemic use decreased by 33% between 2001 and 2009. This was driven primarily by the 44% decrease in consumption of unrestricted antibacterials, which was offset by a 42% increase in the consumption of restricted agents. The patterns of antibacterial use also changed. In 2001 the most frequently used classes of antibacterials were other \u03b2-lactam antibacterials (predominantly cephalosporins), tetracyclines and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (penicillins). By 2009, the other \u03b2-lactam antibacterials were still used most often, but use of penicillins had greatly outpaced that of the tetracyclines owing to a large decrease in consumption of the tetracyclines and an increase in the use of combinations of penicillins. Other classes with relatively large changes in use included the lincosamides (5.1-fold decrease), macrolides (2.5-fold decrease), aminoglycosides (3.6-fold decrease) and sulfonamides and trimethoprim (3.3-fold decrease). Simultaneous changes were observed in the incidence of HA-MRSA and the prevalence of MRSA. The proportion of patients infected with S. aureus in whom the strains were methicillin resistant (HA-MRSA incidence), the proportion of isolates that were resistant (MRSA prevalence) and the number of patients infected with HA-MRSA per total number of PD (infection density) all declined between 2001 and 2009. The prevalence of MRSA was significantly positively correlated with the decrease in total antibiotic use. These results are in general agreement with those from numerous other investigations that have shown a correlation between the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic use [7].",

Although the extent of reduction varies and the specific provisions differ, these policies have been reported to be generally successful in reducing the consumption of antibiotics. A hospital in Italy reported an overall decrease of 8.5% in antibiotic use in the first year following adoption of an antibiotic control programme [24]. A hospital in Taiwan that adopted a policy similar to ours reported a decline of 13.2% in DDD/100 PD for parenteral antimicrobials immediately before and after implementation [25]. A novel feature of our study is that it spans a 9-year period following the implementation of an antimicrobial control policy, allowing an evaluation of the extent to which the provisions have been followed over time. This is particularly important in light of the findings of a study investigating the relationship between antimicrobial control policies and antimicrobial resistance rates in 33 hospitals in the USA in 2007 [26]. The authors of this report found that only 10 of the hospitals had an antibiotic use policy and that there was no correlation between the existence of an antibiotic use policy and resistance rates. Because they had no evidence that the policies were actually practiced in the hospitals that had adopted them, it was impossible to conclude whether the policies were effective.",

During that time, significant reductions (35.2%) in the utilisation of inpatient care were observed [27], probably because individuals were fearful of becoming exposed to the virus in hospitals and clinics. We speculate that this fear may have led to a bias towards more seriously ill individuals seeking health care during this period, which may have distorted the baseline characteristics of the inpatient population in CSMU. This cohort of more seriously ill patients might have driven up the consumption of antibiotics. It is noteworthy that the incidence HA-MRSA infection and the prevalence of MRSA continued to mirror the use of antibiotics during this time.",

Studies on the molecular epidemiology of MRSA isolates obtained from the study period are required to delineate the possibility of decreased clonal spread of isolates caused by improved infection control measures.
