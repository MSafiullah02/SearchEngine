Despite advances in prophylactic viral and fungal therapy to minimize the viral and fungal burden early after HSCT, breakthrough viral and fungal infections remain life-threatening, and for some viral and fungal infections, there are no effective therapies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Vaccine strategies to induce immunity to CMV began in the 1970s but have been limited in their success [10] [11] [12] . The conditioning regimens for HSCT that vary from non-myeloablative to myeloablative create an immunodeficiency that leaves the allogeneic HSCT recipient susceptible to viral and fungal infections while immune reconstitution occurs during the first 6-9 months after HSCT. Immune reconstitution is further abrogated by intensive immunosuppression used to prevent and/or control GVHD. It is clearly established that the kinetics and rate of T-cell reconstitution are critical to controlling viral infections. Factors that speed T-cell recovery will decrease the risk of viral infection during the first 3 months after HSCT [2, 3, 13] . Early studies showed that donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) given before T-cell reconstitution from the stem cell donor were effective for treating viral infections in HSCT recipients but were associated with a high risk of GVHD [14] . Since the early 1990s, investigators began to develop virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (vCTL) for adoptive immunotherapy against specific targets early during immune reconstitution after HSCT [15, 16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 145, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 146, "end": 149, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 150, "end": 153, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 417, "end": 420, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 425, "end": 428, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 429, "end": 432, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 433, "end": 436, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 542, "end": 546, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 547, "end": 551, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 552, "end": 556, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1183, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1186, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1629, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1633, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Advances in vCTL therapy have benefited from (1) advances in understanding of immune responses to conserved T-cell epitopes for various pathogens [17] [18] [19] , (2) technological advances in ex vivo expansion of T cells and advances in the preparation of antigen-presenting cells [20] [21] [22] , and (3) assays that evaluate vCTL activity and the MHC restriction of vCTL [23, 24] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 150, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 156, "end": 160, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 163, "end": 166, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 282, "end": 286, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 287, "end": 291, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 292, "end": 296, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 379, "end": 382, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this chapter, we review the following areas of how: (1) T cells have been expanded to target multiple pathogens; (2) vCTL production no longer requires viral infection or viral vector transduction of antigen-presenting cells (APCs); (3) The source of lymphocytes is no longer restricted to donors who are immune to the pathogens; (4) Naive T cells have been redirected with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs) to target pathogen-infected cells; (5) Bispecific antibody (BiAb)-armed T cells (BATs) can mediate vCTL activity; and (6) Pathogen-specific T-cell products can be manufactured by third parties and banked for \"off-the-shelf\" use post-HSCT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 239, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We summarized the methodological approaches, clinical trials using vCTL, promising preclinical studies, and early clinical trials of anti-pathogen CTLs that have promise.

CMV viral-or peptide-specific stimulation in vitro expands single or multiple pathogenspecific vCTL. The advantages of culture over cell selection are the generation and expansion of polyclonal vCTL to clinically useful quantities of vCTL from small amounts of blood [31] . However, the major disadvantages of this strategy is the daunting task of culturing and processing after stimulation to expand the vCTL (up to more than 1 month) and the HLAhistocompatibility requirement of finding a closely matched donor. During these longer-term cultures, the vCTL may lose their capacity to self-renew and to persist in vivo, particularly after prolonged ex vivo culture [32] . It should be noted that clinical trials infusing ex vivo expanded vCTL post-HSCT showed prolonged persistence [33] and that ex vivo expansion using pathogen-specific stimuli decreased alloreactivity [19] . This may be due to selection of virus-specific clones and deselection of alloreactive clones. One study showed that residual alloreactivity seen in vCTL is clinically insignificant [34] . The initial trials of vCTL therapy required CMV lysates on APC, CMV-infected fibroblasts, or EBV-lymphoblastoid cells lines as a stimulant for expansion of donor-derived memory T cells [25, 27, 35] . The discovery of dominant and highly conserved antigens such as CMV-pp65 and adenovirus hexon and penton led to replacement of live viral stimulation with either 15-mer peptide pools spanning viral proteins or DNA plasmidtransduced antigen-presenting cells [36, 37] . The newer approaches to rapidly expand and manipulate APCs enabled use of a less restricted population of donors and the targeting of an increased number of pathogens in a single culture [20, 38] . In a recent rapid vCTL protocol, the addition of IL-4 and IL-7 leads to production of CD4+ T cells with a Th 1 phenotype, whereas IL-2 and IL-15 tended to favor in vitro natural killer (NK) cell expansion [37] .

This approach would not be viable for obtaining immune CTLs from pathogen-naive donors. Multimer selection is achieved by binding of HLA-peptide complexes to T-cell receptors (TCRs) of known antigen specificity, followed by purification of bound cells, e.g., by magnetic column separation. Alternatively, antiviral T cells expressing interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) can be isolated using the gamma capture assay. Direct selection methods have the advantage of rapid manufacturing time. Unfortunately, these approaches require apheresis of donors in order to collect sufficient cells for sorting and processing for clinical appli-cations and pre-existing and detectable pathogenspecific T cells in the blood. Multimer selection is major histocompatibility (MHC)-restricted and selects only CD8+ T cells of a limited specificity. This could possibly allow pathogen evasion and impair persistence of vCTL in vivo [42] . Earlier studies suggested that persistent binding of multimers to the TCR may impair T-cell function [43] . Recent reversible Streptamer technology for direct selection may overcome the problem of impaired function [44] . IFN-\u03b3 positive selection captures polyclonal antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and selects for a wider range of antigen-specific cells.

Since chemical or molecularly engineered constructs could be used to target the TCR on one hand and tumor-associated antigen (TAA) on the other hand, we reasoned that CMV could be targeted by chemically heteroconjugating OKT3 (anti-CD3, anti-TCR) with Cytogam\u00ae (polyclonal donor-derived anti-CMV IgG, designated CMVBi) to kill CMV-infected fibroblasts [95] . In this strategy shown in Fig. 20 .1, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-activated T cells (ATC) which expanded in low-dose IL-2 were the T effector cells. ATC alone do not kill CMVinfected targets.

The polyclonal nature of the Cytogam may provide multiple antibody clones directed at multiple CMV epitopes on the CMV-infected targets leading to the increased potency at a low arming dose of CMVBi. Cytotoxicity was evident at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 25:1, 13:1, 6:1, and 3:1 compared to unarmed ATC alone.

Unarmed ATC, Cytogam\u00ae, or CMVBi alone did not exhibit significant killing of uninfected or CMV-infected fibroblasts. Furthermore, cultures of CMVBiarmed ATC with CMV-infected targets induced cytokine and chemokine release from CMVBiarmed ATC. This simple targeting strategy bypasses MHC-restricted cytotoxicity for treating viral disease in organ transplant and HSCT recipients. It was shown that CMVBi ATC do not react to alloantigens in vitro in a mixed lymphocyte culture, and they can be frozen and reinfused at different time points as an \"off-the-shelf\" drug.

Although the CTLs provided protection in vivo, the Adv-CTLs could not be detected except in the setting of Adv infection; these data suggest that levels of specific vCTLs below the limits of detection by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpots provide protection and infection induces clonal expansion. Similarly, Ad5f35pp65 transduced dendritic cells (DC) used to produce CMV-and Adv-CTLs were clinically effective in 12 patients after allogeneic HSCT [84] . There were a few cases of CMV reactivation in the setting of lowdose prednisone. This approach was applied to 50 patients after allogeneic HSCT with triviral (CMV, EBV, Adv-specific) CTLs using two methods: 10 were produced by pulsing donor DCs with the HLA-A2 restricted CMV peptide NLVPMVATV and 40 were produced using Ad5f35pp65-transduced donor DCs [87] .

Further, VST products targeting multiple viral antigens have been shown to provide effective antiviral protection (against CNV, EBV and Ad) in ten patients after HSCT [37] .

Fourteen of 48 VST products manufactured from HSCT donors recognized all 5 viral components while 35 (73%) recognized 3 or more by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpots.

These trials established safety, but exhibited limited antiviral efficacy [76, 77] . A major challenge for this approach is the outgrowth of escape mutants expressing alterations of the target epitope so the infected cell can no longer be targeted by the effector cells. A more successful approach has been inserting genes that would provide HIV resistance. This approach was clinically tested when antisense gene complementary to HIV env was transduced into T cells from 17 patients using lentiviral vectors [78] .

When CCR5-delta32 mutations were introduced to CD4enriched T cells through the use of a zinc-finger nuclease [79] , the CCR5-edited T cells were subsequently infused in 12 patients, and engineered T cells were detectable in the peripheral blood for up to 42 months post infusion. In six patients who underwent antiviral treatment interruption, the absolute number of gene modified CD4+ T cells decreased at a lower rate than non-modified T cells.

This strategy was first validated in a phase I trial involving 8 patients who received partially matched EBV-CTLs for PTLD that developed after solid organ transplantation [66, 67] and confirmed in a cohort of 33 patients in a phase II trial [68] . The latter trial showed a response rate of 64% at 5 weeks and 52% at 6 months; the outcomes correlated with the degree of HLA matching between the CTL donor and recipient.

A bank of 32 CTL lines with characterized activity against EBV, CMV, and Adv were used to match for 50 patients with refractory viral infections.

Despite partial HLA matching at one to four loci, there were only two patients who developed grade I GVHD. Clones that are responsible for GVHD have been selected against in the expansion culture and may exist at such low precursor frequencies after culture that they do not expand enough to cause clinically significant GVHD. The lower rate of response against EBV relative to CMV and Adv may reflect selective expansion of T cells against immunodominant epitopes of the latter two viruses, thereby complicating the selection of an ideal third-party pathogen-specific line that fulfills the requirements of antiviral activity and MHC-restriction against multiple pathogens.
