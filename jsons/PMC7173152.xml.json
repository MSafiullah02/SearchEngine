The disease is a canid zoonosis (ZVL) caused by Leishmania chagasi in America and by Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean basin and Middle East, and an anthroponosis caused by Leishmania donovani in Africa, India and Asia. Nowadays there are 500,000 new human cases registered annually worldwide [1], [2]. The drug resistance and toxicity of chemotherapy, the increase of the disease incidence of immunocompromised subjects, and the difficulties of the epidemiological control, which is based upon sacrificing of seropositive dogs, emphasizes the need for safe prophylactic vaccines for both humans and dogs [3]. Mathematical modelling analysis indicates the need for human and canine vaccines as tools to reduce the incidence of the disease in endemic regions [4].",

Lemesre et al.

Regarding the recombinant vaccines, the multicomponent Leish-111f fusion protein in combination with MPL-SE or AdjuPrime was only immunogenic in dogs challenged with L. chagasi\n[9] and L. infantum (MML) [10] and failed to prevent L. infantum natural infection or the progression of disease in dogs in an open kennel trial [11]. A few third-generation DNA vaccines have been tested in dogs against experimentally induced CVL [12], [13], [14], [15] achieving different levels of protection, but no data from field trials of any DNA formulation is so far available [16].",

            "text": "Despite the recent intensification in research for a canine vaccine only two second-generation vaccines with native antigens have progressed to Phase III field trials: the FML-saponin [17], [18] and the LiESAp vaccines [19]. The FML (fucose\u2013mannose ligand) glycoproteic complex [20], antigenic for both humans [21] and dogs [22], was formulated, as a second-generation vaccine, with Quillaja saponaria saponin and underwent Phase I\u2013III trials becoming the Leishmune\u00ae licensed vaccine in Brazil [23]. The FML was immunogenic, immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic, in mice and hamsters and canine field trials [17], [18], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In the first Phase III dog assay [17], 4 deaths and 6 symptomatic cases among 30 placebo-treated dogs (33%) were detected and confirmed by parasite analysis and PCR. No deaths were detected among vaccines and infection was confirmed in 3/36 oligosymptomatic dogs (8.33%), resulting in 92% protection and 76% vaccine efficacy [17]. In the second field assay [18], the infective pressure was higher and 2 years after vaccination, deaths were detected in 8/33 (25%) placebo-treated and 1/20 (5%) vaccinated dogs, resulting in 95% of protection and 80% vaccine efficacy. This protection lasted for at least 3.5 years and was concomitant with the reduction of the human incidence of the disease in the area [18]. The FML-vaccine also produced an immunotherapeutic effect when administered to L. donovani- or L. chagasi-infected dogs while they were still asymptomatic [28]. The decrease in the canine and human incidence of visceral leishmaniasis in the vaccinated area [18] and the maintenance of normal proportions of CD4 and CD21 lymphocyte levels in the blood of vaccinated dogs [28] indicate that dog vaccination with the FML-vaccine reduces dog infectivity to sand flies [23]. LiESAp + MDP vaccine, the other second-generation vaccine with native antigens, was recently used in a field assay with naturally exposed dogs of South France [19]. In this trial any dog showing clinical and/or serological evidence, infection was confirmed (or not) by the presence of parasites in bone marrow cultures and by PCR analysis. After 2 years, the incidence of infection was 0.61% (1/165) in vaccines versus 6.86% (12/175) in placebo-treated dogs (92% vaccine efficacy) [19]. The authors claimed a vaccine efficacy of 92% based on the confirmation of infection by very sensitive methods such as PCR or culture, instead of CVL deaths [19] which did not occur in this area of lower incidence. The FML-vaccine unlike the LiESAp vaccine revealed protection not only against infection, but also against severe disease and deaths due to CVL [17], [18] reducing morbidity and mortality [17], [18] which are much stronger criteria of protection [29].",

On day 0, before vaccination, 50 from the 600 dogs were excluded due to their positive reaction to the more sensitive FMLELISA assay [22]. The remaining 550 dogs, seronegative to the FML antigen, asymptomatic and showing good physical condition, became the trial group of this investigation. Each of the 30 veterinarians participating in this trial vaccinated 20 dogs with three doses of Leishmune\u00ae, making a total of 1800 doses. The animals were monitored for their anti-FML IgG serum antibody titters by the FML-ELISA assay [22] at days 0 and 70 and in months 7 and 12, and by their intradermal response to the L. donovani promastigote lysate [17], [18] antigen in months 7 and 12. The serum was collected and intradermal test was carried out before injection of the vaccine booster in month 12. Also, clinical evaluations were performed every 3 months, during the 2-year period (2003\u20132005). Alopecia, onychogryphosis, cachexia, anorexia, apathy, disseminated ulcers, skin lesions, keratitis, renal failure, loss of weight, lymph node enlargement or diarrhoea were recorded as visceral leishmaniasis symptoms. In vaccinated symptomatic animals, Leishmania infection was confirmed either by PCR analysis of lymph node aspirates and/or blood samples [23] or by direct microscopical observation of Leishmania amastigotes in Giemsa stained lymph node smears [31]. The Leishmune\u00ae-vaccinated dog cohort included 511 animals (85%) from 61 different breeds and of 89 (15%) mongrel dogs [32]. All animals were previously vaccinated against distemper, parvovirosis, parainfluenza virus, leptospirosis, coronaviruses, type 2 adenoviruses and rabies.",

For the ex vivo analysis, 30 \u03bcl of blood was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, with 30 \u03bcl of each one of the following monoclonal antibodies diluted in Facs dil solution (10% FCS-supplemented PBS buffer): anti-Thy-1 (Rat-IgG2b-clone YKIX337.217) (1:800), anti-CD5 (Rat-IgG2a-clone YKIX322.3) (1:800), anti-CD4 (Rat-IgG2a-clone YKIX302.9) (1:12500), and anti-CD8 (Rat-IgG1-clone YCATE55.9) (1:100). Facs dil solution was used as negative control. After this period, 2 ml of PBS-W (PBS buffer with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide) were added to each tube and the mixture was homogenised, and centrifuged at 1300 rpm, at room temperature, for 7 min. The supernatants were aspirated and pellets homogenised and added to 60 \u03bcl of anti-rat FITC conjugate (1:200) (Serotec, UK) except for the Facs dil cell control. At this time, 4 \u03bcl of the FITC-labelled mouse anti-human-CD21 (Mouse-IgG1-clone IOB1a) monoclonal antibody (Immunotech Co., Marseille, France) was used in a direct immunofluorescence procedure. All suspensions were homogenised, incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and treated with 2 ml of the 1/10 diluted lysis solution during vortex homogenisation (Becton & Dickinson, USA). The mixtures were further incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark and further centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 7 min. Supernatants were discarded and the pellet-containing tubes were inverted on to absorbent paper. All these procedures were repeated twice after the addition of 2 ml PBS. The pellets were homogenised carefully and finally fixed with 300 \u03bcl of 2.8% formaldehyde\u2013PBS.

Soon after complete vaccination, the percent of seropositivity to FML in dogs treated with the FML-saponin vaccine was 62% [17], while it reached 98% in Leishmune\u00ae vaccines. This indicates the earlier achievement of humoral response induced by the commercial formulation, which is an important indicator of the vaccine potency. The humoral response was also sustained at high levels for 12 months after vaccination, probably due to the natural booster effect of L. chagasi-infected sand flies of the endemic area. Conversely, a previous kennel experiment in a non-endemic area, showed in Leishmune\u00ae-vaccinated unexposed dogs, a decrease in absorbencies from day 70 (1.017 \u00b1 0.250) to month 12 after vaccination (0.673 \u00b1 0.160) (unpublished results).",

Indeed, the average percent value of CD4 lymphocytes in naturally infected dogs with visceral leishmaniasis was 20.47% [45]. On the other hand, vaccination against ZVL is expected to expand or sustain the CD4+ T cell levels. The expansion or sustention of CD4+ T cell levels of dogs treated with L. infantum vaccine immunochemotherapy was 35% [50], with the FML-QuilA vaccine it was 43.30%, with FML-saponin R 44.94% [28] and with the Leishmune\u00ae vaccine was 35.00% [46]. Sustained CD4+ T cell were found also in this investigation in dogs vaccinated with Leishmune\u00ae, and sustained L. chagasi-specific CD4+ T cell proportions were found before in dogs treated with Leishmune\u00ae after infection [31] indicating that the commercial formulation maintains the immunogenicity and potency demonstrated by the FML-saponin vaccine in the prophylaxis [17] and immunotherapy [28] against ZVL. Both the Leishmune\u00ae prophylactic vaccine, which contains 0.5 mg of [23] and the Leishmune\u00ae immunotherapeutic [31] or the L. brasiliensis\n[47] vaccines, that contain 1mg of the Riedel de Haen saponin, maintain the normal levels of CD4+ lymphocytes in vaccinated unexposed [47], exposed [28] or challenged [31] dogs.",

The levels of CD21+ cells were higher in vaccinees, with a mean average that fell outside the CI95% interval of the normal dogs. Increased CD21+ B cell levels were also found in dogs vaccinated with the L. brasiliensis-saponin vaccine that uses the same adjuvant included in Leishmune\u00ae\n[47] and in unexposed dogs vaccinated with Leishmune\u00ae\n[46]. The increase in total and in Leishmania-specific CD21+ B circulating lymphocytes was synchronous with the induction of an intense humoral response [47]. Also, a positive correlation was found between PBMC proliferation in response to L. chagasi antigen and CD21+ B cells. This was considered an indication of the major APC function of the CD21+ cells [47]. On the other hand, decreased CD21+ B cell proportions are expected to occur in untreated infected dogs with advanced ZVL [45], [48], which also exhibit hypergammaglobulinemia, a hallmark of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis [51]. These facts suggest that the CD21+ B lymphocyte population, which increased after vaccination with Leishmune\u00ae is involved not merely in the expansion of the total humoral response but in the increase of the specific synthesis of the IgG2 anti-FML antibodies that are related to protection [52], [53], [54], [55], [56] and blockage of the transmission of VL in the field [30].",

A classic Phase III trial, with random double-blind selected controls could not be performed because of the ethical restrictions of the veterinarians from these epidemic areas, who refused to include untreated healthy dogs as exposed controls. Leishmune\u00ae-induced protection against ZVL, is however suggested by the results of 98.8% of asymptomatic dogs (at the end of first year) and 99% healthy survivors (at the end of the second year) among vaccinated dogs, compared to the 79.4% of asymptomatic and 61% survivor dogs monitored in an untreated exposed cohort in another endemic area. Although a vaccine against ZVL is considered an efficient tool for eradication of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis [4] and Leishmune\u00ae is the first vaccine in the world to be licensed against ZVL [16], its vaccine coverage in Brazil is still very low. In spite of this the incidence of ZVL among vaccinated dogs in Belo Horizonte suffered a significant reduction of 66.1% (p\n < 0.005), and there was an 80.2% (p\n < 0.005) significant decline in Ara\u00e7atuba, when compared to the global incidence of ZVL of both towns, respectively. Thus our preliminary results then support the potential use of Leishmune\u00ae for the prevention of ZVL epidemics.",
