The isolated virus, originally believed to belong to the family Rhabdoviridae, measured 130\u2013180 nm in length and 31\u201347 nm in diameter. Additional phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genome proved that the fathead minnow virus isolate is a species within the genus Bafinivirus, subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales and was named the fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV, Batts et al., 2012). The detection of FHMNV and the marked pathology it causes raised concerns about potential losses in the multi-billion dollar baitfish industry and the potential for transmitting this deadly infectious agent to other water bodies, thereby threatening other native fish species.",

To develop an RT-LAMP assay specific to FHMNV, the spike glycoprotein gene, which has been shown to be comparatively variable among other genes within nidovirus genomes (Nga et al., 2011, Lauber et al., 2012), was chosen as the target gene for this assay. Three pairs of RT-LAMP primers, including a pair of loop primers, were designed as described by Nagamine et al. (2002). The spike protein gene from the FHMNV genome (GenBank accession number GU002364) was submitted to the website (http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/index.html) and a set of RT-LAMP primers was generated by the Primer Explorer software, version 4.0 (Table 1\nand Fig. 1\n).",

The cells were infected with the appropriate virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 TCID50 per cell and total RNA was isolated at 48 h p.i. Additionally, the specificity of the FHMNV LAMP assay was tested against three fish pathogenic rhabdoviruses isolated from infected cells: infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (genus Novirhabdovirus), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb (genus Novirhabdovirus), and the spring viremia of carp virus (genus Vesiculorhabdovirus). Additional fish pathogenic viruses used for specificity testing included the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (genus Aquabirnavirus) isolated from infected cells and the genomic DNA of alloherpesvirus epizootic epitheliotropic disease virus (EEDV, salmonids herpesvirus 3), recovered from lake trout infected with EEDV.

For real-time monitoring, the qRT-LAMP reactions were incubated at 63 \u00b0C for 40 cycles (one minute per cycle) with an Eppendorf realplex 2 (Eppendorf).

The best results in terms of obtaining clear bands and maximizing amplification products were obtained when the Mg2+ concentration was at 8 mM (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we considered the optimal Mg2+ concentration to be 8 mM and further optimization experiments were performed at that concentration. The optimum temperature for RT-LAMP was found to be 63 \u00b0C, at which clear bands and maximum amplification products were obtained (Fig. 2B). Using the optimized Mg2+ concentration and incubation temperature, amplified products could be observed as early as 20 min after starting the reaction. An additional 10\u201320 min of reaction time, however, produced better amplification results (Fig. 2C).

With 16 ng RNA (approximately 106 copies of virus, determined by quantitative RT-LAMP) from EPC cells infected with FHMNV as template, clear positive bands can be observed even when the incubation time is 20 min due to the addition of loop primers, which proved to accelerate the LAMP reaction (Nagamine et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2012) and also showed the advantage of rapid RT-LAMP.",

We plan to regularly validate and, if needed, further improve the specificity of the assay when novel closely related nidoviruses are discovered. The developed assay is estimated to detect as little as five copies, which is considered very sensitive. These results are in line with previously described LAMP assays developed for a number of viruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Hong et al., 2004), noroviruses (Yoda et al., 2007, Suzuki et al., 2011), human astrovirus (Wei et al., 2013), and influenza A virus (H7N9, Ge et al., 2013). On the other hand, the analytical sensitivities of the RT-LAMP method and RT-PCR were 1.6 fg and 1.6 pg of RNA extracted from FHMNV-infected EPC cells, respectively. This suggests a 1000-fold higher analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay than that of the RT-PCR assay. This finding is in agreement with the reports of Chen et al. (2011) for the Scylla serrata reovirus; Arunrut et al. (2011) for the Laem-Singh virus; and Wang et al. (2013) for the hepatitis delta virus genotype I, which reveals that RT-LAMP is more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR for these viruses.
