Human pathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter spp., may reside in the chicken intestinal tract without giving rise to clinical symptoms, but are major causes of food poisoning (Helms et al., 2006, Kessel et al., 2001). Domesticated birds are also an important reservoir of avian influenza A virus subtypes that pose a threat to both animal and human health (e.g. H5N1) and have been linked to regularly reoccurring outbreaks of influenza in Asia (Kung et al., 2007). Thus, animal health and public health will greatly benefit if the innate immune system of domesticated birds can be boosted to limit or even prevent colonization and spreading of zoonotic pathogens.",

Defensins, a subset of antimicrobial peptides, are cystine-rich peptides that vary in length from 18 to approximately 45 amino acids and are enriched in hydrophobic and cationic aa residues (Selsted and Ouellette, 2005). In addition to their direct antimicrobial activities, immunomodulatory properties have also been demonstrated. Defensins can promote adaptive immunity by selective recruitment by chemotaxis of monocytes (Territo et al., 1989), T lymphocytes (Chertov et al., 1996), immature dendritic cells (Yang et al., 1999) and mast cells (Niyonsaba et al., 2002) to sites of inflammation. Furthermore, they are able to induce histamine release from peritoneal mast cells (Befus et al., 1999) and to enhance macrophage phagocytosis (Fleischmann et al., 1985, Ichinose et al., 1996).",

In addition, defensins may enhance wound repair by inducing fibroblast (Murphy et al., 1993) and epithelial cell proliferation (Aarbiou et al., 2002, Aarbiou et al., 2004, Murphy et al., 1993). In vertebrates, three different defensin subfamilies (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b8) exist, differing in disulfide bridge pairing and positioning of their conserved six cysteine residues, Cys1\u2013Cys6, Cys2\u2013Cys4, Cys3\u2013Cys5 for \u03b1-defensins versus Cys1\u2013Cys5, Cys2\u2013Cys4, Cys3\u2013Cys6 for \u03b2-defensins (Selsted and Ouellette, 2005). The observation that \u03b1- or \u03b8-defensins have not been found in phylogenetically much older vertebrates, such as birds and fish, suggests that all defensin subfamilies must have evolved from an ancestral \u03b2-defensin gene by duplication and diversification (Semple et al., 2003).",

Chicken \u03b2-defensin genes consist of four exons (Fig. 1\n), with the exception of the AvBD12 gene where the last two exons have fused (Xiao et al., 2004). Defensins are synthesised as inactive precursors, i.e. prepropeptides, consisting of a short signal peptide, a propiece and the mature peptide. The propiece is often but not always anionic. For example, AvBD1 and -2 do not contain a negatively charged propiece (Brockus et al., 1998). The 1st exon corresponds to the 5\u2032UTR region, the 2nd exon encodes the signal peptide and part of the propiece, while the remaining part of the short propiece and majority of the mature peptide are encoded by the 3rd exon. The remaining part of the mature peptide and the 3\u2032UTR region are encoded by the 4th exon (Fig. 1). The chicken 3q3.5\u2013q3.7 \u03b2-defensin locus appears to have evolved by a series of gene duplications, followed by substantial divergence of the exon(s) encoding the mature peptide with substantial \u201cpositive selection\u201d, i.e. involving mutations that disproportionately favour the selection of charged aa residues. This is further emphasized by the finding of phylogenetically more conserved genes, such as cathepsin B and HARL2754, in close proximity of chicken, mouse and human \u03b2-defensin clusters (Xiao et al., 2004) and suggests that vertebrate \u03b2-defensins originate from a single ancestral gene.",

            "text": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are commonly found in \u03b2-defensin genes, and although present only at a low frequency in the coding region, the occurrence of SNPs may seriously affect an individual's predisposition to disease (Braida et al., 2004), by altering the efficiency of transcription and translation or by generating an altered protein sequence with diminished biological functions (Jurevic et al., 2002). SNP analysis of the chicken \u03b2-defensin cluster revealed a much higher SNP rate (13.2 SNPs/kb) for the 3.25 kb region containing the AvBD2, -3, -4, -5 and -7 genes, than the rate across the whole chicken genome (5 SNPs/kb) as was previously reported (Wong et al., 2004). However, all 43 identified SNPs were intronic, with the exception of a nonsynonymous SNP found in the AvBD5 gene that resulted in an amino acid substitution of proline to threonine. In addition to the variability in gene nucleotide sequence, studies in humans have shown that specific defensin genes may be completely absent in some individuals (Ballana et al., 2007). Moreover, in contrast to other innate immune genes, defensins may show a high degree of polymorphism in gene copy number (Hollox et al., 2003, Linzmeier and Ganz, 2005, Linzmeier and Ganz, 2006), the latter of which has been linked to predisposition to Crohn's disease of the colon in humans (Fellermann et al., 2006). Few studies have addressed the disease predisposition of birds in relation to innate immune gene polymorphisms. Hasenstein et al. (2006) addressed the association of avian \u03b2-defensin gene polymorphisms in 1-week-old F1 chickens with their phenotypic immune response to S. enteriditis challenge. In this study, AvBD2 and -5 gene polymorphisms were moderately associated with caecal and spleen bacterial loads at 1 week post-challenge. The significant associations observed between polymorphisms of the AvBD3 and AvBD7 genes and S. enteriditis vaccine antibody response at 21 days, suggest that avian \u03b2-defensin genes may facilitate the transition from an innate immune response to an adaptive immune response in newly hatched birds (Hasenstein et al., 2006). Thus, polymorphisms in avian innate immune genes, encoding signalling pathway components as well as innate immune effectors, can be directly associated with disease resistance. Hence, the allelic selection of genes involved in host immunity by selective breeding may confer an increased efficiency of the innate immune system (Georges, 2001). However, it remains to be elucidated to which extent gene polymorphisms (SNPs) and variations in \u03b2-defensin copy number play a role in the resistance of birds to Salmonella infections.",

            "text": "Deduced primary amino acid sequences for avian mature defensins indicate that, similar to mammalian \u03b2-defensins (Pazgier et al., 2006), these peptides consist of 36 aa or more residues with the consensus sequence motif: xn-C-x2\u20134-G-x1\u20132-C-x3\u20135-C-x9\u201310-C-x5\u20136-CC-xn. NMR spectroscopy analysis of synthetic king penguin AvBD103b in aqueous solution revealed a three-dimensional structure most similar to mammalian \u03b2-defensins (Landon et al., 2004) (Fig. 1). The overall fold consisted of a three-stranded \u03b2-sheet and an \u03b1-helical N-terminus in the structure and contained a hydrophobic patch (Phe19-Pro20-Ile22-Val37-Trp38), shown by comparative structure analysis to be well but not strictly conserved in other avian defensins. The 10 Arg residues and lack of Glu or Asp residues renders king penguin AvBD103b highly cationic (10+). Some avian \u03b2-defensin genes, e.g. AvBD3, -11 and -13, contain a large postpiece, although the AvBD13 nucleotide sequence reported by Higgs et al. lacks this postpiece suggesting that there might be strain-specific splice variants or isoforms of the AvBD13 gene (Higgs et al., 2005). Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of chicken and turkey AvBD3 (91% identical on a nucleotide level), the latter of which lacks a postpiece, revealed that a two-base insertion just before the chicken AvBD3 original stop codon, causes a frame shift, and an additional 15 bp insertion was responsible for the generation of an anionic postpiece in chicken AvBD3 (Zhao et al., 2001). The AvBD11 postpiece contains a defensin-like motif: x9-C-x4-G-x-C-x6-C-x7-C-x6-CC-x3, which might be a consequence of gene duplication. Interestingly, of the newly identified human \u03b2-defensins mapped to chromosomes 6 and 20 (hBD-18 to 21, hBD-23, hBD-25 to 29 and hBD-31), those clustered on chromosome 20 all contained similar long C-terminal tails (Schutte et al., 2002). These C-terminal tails differ substantially in amino acid composition and do not exhibit homology with other sequences (Pazgier et al., 2006). It has been suggested that the accumulated negative charges present in some of these large postpieces could function similarly to the anionic charges present in the \u03b1-defensin propiece (Rodr\u00edguez-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2003). The net anionic charges in the propiece of \u03b1-defensins are thought to balance out the cationic net charge of the mature peptide, which might be important for folding and prevention of intracellular binding to membranes (Liu and Ganz, 1995, Michaelson et al., 1992, Valore et al., 1996, Wu et al., 2007). The biological function of these large postpieces and their putative role during folding and intracellular trafficking remains to be elucidated.",

The abundant mRNA levels of AvBD4 to -7 found in chicken bone marrow, and the absence of significant AvBD4 to -7 expression in leukocyte extracts (Xiao et al., 2004), suggest that, similar to mammalian defensins (Landon et al., 2004, Yount et al., 1999), myeloid avian \u03b2-defensin mRNA synthesis is largely absent in mature leukocytes. After biosynthesis and intracellular trafficking through the Golgi apparatus, the \u223c19 aa signal peptide, that functions to anchor the prodefensin peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, is rapidly proteolytically cleaved to generate a prodefensin peptide with little or no microbicidal activity (Satchell et al., 2003). The large (\u223c40 aa) \u03b1-defensin propiece has demonstrated to be essential for subcellular trafficking and sorting of pro-\u03b1-defensins into specific secretory granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) (Liu and Ganz, 1995). The fact that \u03b2-defensins possess only a relative small propiece suggests that the subcellular trafficking of pro-\u03b2-defensins may be different. Non-myeloid biosynthesis of \u03b2-defensin has been described to some detail for mammalian epithelial cells (Dale et al., 2001, Oren et al., 2003). In birds, non-myeloid \u03b2-defensin expression has been found for epithelial cells (Ohashi et al., 2005, Yoshimura et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2001), but data describing their biosynthesis in these cells and tissues has not yet been reported. Paneth cells (known to contain large amounts of \u03b1-defensins) are specialized secretory cells located at the base of the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn in some species. Paneth cells or related cells were reported to be absent in ostrich, but have not been investigated in other avian species (Porter et al., 2002). It remains to be examined if birds possess Paneth-like cells that contribute to intestinal innate immunity.",

The expression levels of \u03b2-defensins in chicken skin agrees with the reported basal expression of hBD-1\u20134 in keratinocytes of normal human skin, of which the latter three were strongly increased during induced keratinocyte differentiation (Harder et al., 2004). hBD-2 is a major constituent of psoriatic skin, a chronic non-infectious disease in which surprisingly few cutaneous infections occur (Harder and Schr\u00f6der, 2005), whereas hBD-2 and other AMPs are deficient in atopic dermatitis, in which bacterial and viral skin infections are a recurrent problem (Ong et al., 2002). Thus, considering their presence in chicken skin, avian \u03b2-defensins may contribute to skin innate immune defense in birds.",

The crop is an extension of the esophagus in which food can be stored for up to 24 h and is well developed in gallinaceous birds. As chickens practice coprophagy to recover vitamins, amino acids and other nutrients produced by their hindgut bacteria (Montrose et al., 1985), an adequate local innate immune system is required. The high expression levels of AvBD9 in adult chicken crop tissue and its variable expression in juvenile broilers indicate an important role of AvBD9 in crop tissue defense (van Dijk et al., 2007).",

In the intestinal tract of newly hatched chickens, AvBD1 and AvBD2 mRNA levels were found to decrease during the first week and increase during the second week post-hatch (Bar-Shira and Friedman, 2006). Likewise, developmental expression studies of chicken AvBD4 mRNA using 1-, 4-, 17- and 38-day-old animals showed AvBD4 expression to be maximal within the first week post-hatch and to decline thereafter (Milona et al., 2007). In the chicken small and large intestine of older animals, low to medium mRNA levels were found for \u03b2-defensins, previously reported to be expressed in heterophils and/or bone marrow only (Table 2), suggesting it to originate from resident myeloid cells. Considerable AvBD13 mRNA expression was found in small intestinal tissue, liver and gall bladder (Higgs et al., 2005). Similarly, moderate to high mRNA expression in liver (and gall bladder) was found for AvBD8, -9, and -10 (Higgs et al., 2005, Lynn et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2004), which may reflect an important role of avian \u03b2-defensins in the liver during systemic infections. Moderate AvBD1 and -2 expression was detected by real-time PCR in caecal tissue of 3\u20137-week-old (Sadeyen et al., 2004) and 30-week-old chickens (Sadeyen et al., 2006). Other studies on avian \u03b2-defensin expression did not include caecal tissue. Low levels of AvBD13 mRNA were found in colon (Xiao et al., 2004) and only weak to moderate mRNA expression levels were found for AvBD1, -2 and AvBD10 in the cloaca (Lynn et al., 2004). The cloaca and colon are a point of entry for potential microorganisms as in birds anti-peristalsis of the lower intestine, the so-called intestinal reflux, is capable of transporting faeces back into the intestine and past the ileocaecal junction (Duke, 1986). The caecal pouches are the main fermentation sites of poorly digestible substrates and are emptied only once every 8 h on average. Thus, an efficient local immune barrier can be expected to be present at this site to prevent or limit pathogen invasion in the intestinal and urogenital tracts via this infection route.",

            "text": "In birds, the cloaca is also the collecting point of the urogenital tract. Ohashi et al. (2005) examined AvBD1, -2 and -3 mRNA expression in the hen reproductive tract by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and showed that the highest levels occurred in infundibulum for all three gallinacin genes and in vagina for AvBD1 and AvBD3. Localization of expression sites in vaginal tissue using in situ hybridisation identified AvBD1, -2 and -3 in basal cells of the surface epithelium in the mucosal folds. The onset of egg-laying activity at approximately 18 weeks of age (Wigley et al., 2005) and absence of significant AvBD1 to -3 expression in the oviduct reported in 3-month-old hens by Zhao et al. (2001) suggest that expression levels of these gallinacins in the oviduct may be developmentally affected by estrogen levels. AvBD1, -2 and -3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in the vaginal mucosa of older birds, i.e. 180-day-old versus 720-day-old hens (Yoshimura et al., 2006). The decreased avian \u03b2-defensin levels found in the regressed oviducts of feed-withdrawal-induced non-laying birds further supports the idea of fluctuating avian \u03b2-defensin expression levels as a function of egg-laying activity regulated by gonadal steroid hormone levels. Stimulation of cultured chicken vaginal cells with S. enteriditis or LPS increased levels of AvBD1 to -3 within 24 h. The importance of \u03b2-defensins in the protection of the mammalian male and female reproductive tracts is well established. Abundant expression of multiple \u03b2-defensin genes in the male (Palladino et al., 2003, Patil et al., 2005, Sang et al., 2005, Sang et al., 2006, Yamamoto and Matsui, 2002) and female (Aono et al., 2006, Quayle et al., 1998, Valore et al., 1998) reproductive tracts has been reported. The male reproductive system is largely devoid of an adaptive immune system and is therefore depending on an effective innate immune system to prevent infection that may affect temporary or permanent fertility (Patil et al., 2005). Mammalian sperm cells are terminally differentiated when they leave the testis, but lack motility and are incapable of fertilization. During their migration through the epididymis, spermatozoa undergo physiological and functional maturation as a result of which they acquire forward motility and the ability to recognize the zona pellucida (Lakoski et al., 1988). Several mammalian species have been shown to possess chromosomally clustered \u03b2-defensin genes which are differentially expressed, predominantly or restricted, throughout the epididymis (Yamaguchi et al., 2002, Yenugu et al., 2006) and transcriptionally regulated by androgens or other testicular factors (Oh et al., 2006, Yenugu et al., 2006). Epididymal \u03b2-defensins have demonstrated to induce sperm motility and are involved in the sperm capacitation process (Yudin et al., 2003, Yudin et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2004). It is thought that they may either form Ca2+ permeable channels or activate L-type Ca2+ channels in sperm cells, as a result of which Ca2+ could accumulate and induce motility and capacitation (Zhou et al., 2004). In chicken several \u03b2-defensins were found to be strongly expressed in testis (AvBD1, -2, -4, -6, -7 and -10), whereas weak expression levels were observed for AvBD12 in testis and moderate expression levels were found for AvBD9 in testis and vas deferens (Table 2). Expression levels of \u03b2-defensins in epididymal tissue have not yet been addressed. A recent report indicates that human \u03b2-defensin-2 expression contributes, in cooperation with resident flora, to protection against vaginal infection (Valore et al., 2006). The high mRNA levels of multiple avian \u03b2-defensins in kidney and throughout the male and female reproductive tracts (Table 2) suggest a similar role for avian \u03b2-defensins in the protection of the avian urogenital tract. The role of \u03b2-defensins in avian sperm maturation and capacitation and existence of avian epididymis-specific \u03b2-defensins remains to be elucidated.",

Reverse transcriptase PCR analyses detected expression of AvBD4-related sequences in all three non-domesticated species, with highest expression levels in wood pigeon gizzard, and additional low expression in small intestine and liver. For herring gull, low levels were found in small intestine, gizzard and liver, whereas in the blue tit, low AvBD4-like expression was observed in small intestinal tissue, but not in gizzard.

The presence of transcription factor binding sites known to be involved in mammalian \u03b2-defensin regulation in the chicken AvBD9 promoter region and the observation of highly variable AvBD9 levels in crop tissue of 13-day-old chicken broilers, indicate a possible tissue-specific upregulation of the AvBD9 gene (van Dijk et al., 2007).

Two inbred chicken lines differing in resistance to caecal colonization by S. enteriditis have been described (Bumstead and Barrow, 1988). In both young and adult animals, AvBD1 and AvBD2 levels were indeed higher (\u223c10-fold) for the 61 line (resistant phenotype) as compared to the 15I line (susceptible phenotype), which would indicate a possible relation between defensin levels and Salmonella carrier status. However, young animals of the 61 line actually had higher bacterial loads in the caeca (Sadeyen et al., 2004), which suggests that elevated AvBD1 and -2 levels were not directly responsible for the increased resistance against Salmonella caecal carrier status.",

            "text": "In male king penguins (A. patagonicus), gastric \u03b2-defensin expression can be upregulated when fasting during the breeding season (Thouzeau et al., 2003). King penguins only feed at sea, which can entail a 400\u2013500 km journey, and while on land they must live off their reserves. After egg-laying, females return to sea to forage and egg-incubation is taken over by the male. Usually, females come back in time to feed the chick at hatching, but their mates cope with a delayed return of their partner by fasting, thus preserving food in their stomach for 2\u20133 weeks, enabling them to feed the newborn chick for about 10 days (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2000). Analysis of the stomach contents of male penguins identified two \u03b2-defensins, AvBD103a and AvBD103b and other yet unidentified antimicrobial substances (Thouzeau et al., 2003). AvBD103a and -103b concentrations in the stomach contents were compared between food conserving and normally digesting birds during the egg-incubation period. AvBD103b was detected in the stomach of all birds, whereas AvBD103a was detected in only three samples of one conserving bird (Thouzeau et al., 2003). Stomach \u03b2-defensin concentrations were markedly higher in food conserving birds than in digesting birds, i.e. increasing 13-fold from the onset (74 nM) to the end of the fast period (943 nM). Defensin levels in digesting birds remained invariably low (24 nM). By comparison, in mammals defensin concentrations of more than 3 mM have been found in the granules of mammalian leukocytes (Ganz, 1987, Ganz et al., 1985), whereas the concentration of cryptdins (released by Paneth cells) in the crypt lumen was estimated to be \u223c2.4 mM (Ayabe et al., 2000). Approximately 4.5\u201323 \u03bcM of porcine \u03b2-defensin-1 was found in pig dorsal tongue scrapings (Shi et al., 1999).",

Synthetic chicken AvBD9 peptide showed strong microbicidal activity against the Gram-negative bacterium C. jejuni (3.7 \u03bcM), Gram-positive bacteria, C. perfringens, S. aureus (1.9\u20133.7 \u03bcM) and the yeasts C. albicans and S. cerevisiae (1.9 \u03bcM), but was less potent against E. coli (7.5 \u03bcM) and not bactericidal against S. typhimurium (>30 \u03bcM) (van Dijk et al., 2007). In contrast, synthetic chicken AvBD13 peptide was only bactericidal at high peptide concentrations against L. monocytogenes (114 \u03bcM) and S. typhimurium wild-type (114 \u03bcM) and a S. typhimurium Pho P mutant (57 \u03bcM), whereas inhibition of E. coli, S. aureus and S. pyogenes at peptide concentrations \u226457 \u03bcM was negligible or absent (Higgs et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Mature \u03b2-defensin peptides have a three-dimensional amphipathic structure, i.e. they possess spatially opposite domains of clustered hydrophobic and cationic aa side chains. Three intramolecular disulfide bridges restrict conformational changes of these peptides and are well-conserved in this family. For most mature defensins, disulfide bridges and their connectivity appear not to be important for direct antimicrobial activity, but may play a prominent role in other functions, such as protection against proteolysis and chemotaxis (Kl\u00fcver et al., 2005, Selsted and Ouellette, 2005, Wu et al., 2003). On the other hand, amino acid composition and positioning are highly variable and appear to determine the extent to which individual \u03b2-defensins specifically target certain types of microorganisms (Torres and Kuchel, 2004). Their ability to inhibit growth and/or kill microorganisms differs considerably and is likely achieved via multiple mechanisms. Fig. 2\nshows a hypothetical \u201ccarpet-wormhole model\u201d of action for defensins (Ganz, 2003). Cationic peptides are able to interact electrostatically with negatively charged membrane components, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and anionic phospholipids and subsequently pass the membrane via the \u201cself-promoted uptake pathway\u201d (Hancock, 1997). Due to their higher affinity for divalent cation binding places in the outer membrane, cationic peptides can competitively displace Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, important for microbial membrane stability, and subsequently by their larger size, perturb the membrane structure (Hancock, 1997, Hancock and Chapple, 1999). Driven by the large electric potential of the membrane, the perturbing peptide migrates through the membrane and aggregates into multimeric peptide clusters with their hydrophilic sides facing inwards, resulting in stable or transient pore formation or may disrupt the membrane in a detergent-like way (Ganz, 2003, Oren and Shai, 1998). Alternatively, formation of membrane regions with increased permeability, have been proposed. Although the above-described mechanisms of permeabilization, involving carpet formation and pore formation, are supported by ultrastructural studies, this model and alternative models are primarily based on work done with artificial membranes.",

Without a membrane proton-motive force, active transportation of substances across the membrane and rotation of bacterial flagella will stop leading to starvation, a loss of motility and, eventually, lysis. Once transported to intracellular sites, cationic peptides can interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis by binding to DNA and RNA molecules (Lehrer et al., 1989, Tang et al., 1999). In addition, some defensins are able to bind to membrane glycoproteins and may be potentially important for anti-viral activity (Wang et al., 2003). Alternatively, the displacement of divalent cations in the cell wall by cationic peptides can promote autolysis by activating the autolytic cell wall enzymes (muramidases) in bacterial membranes. The main regulators of autolysins in Gram-positive bacteria are (lipo)teichoic acids (Ginsburg, 2002). In dividing Gram-positive cells, activated autolysins remodel the bacterial peptidoglycan layer by their muramidase activity (Koch, 2001). Teichoic and teichuronic acids in the peptidoglycan layer of the Gram-positive cell wall bind autolysins non-competitively and in that way inhibit muramidase activity. Cationic peptides bind to teichoic acids with a higher affinity and can thereby displace and activate autolysins leading to uncontrolled degradation of the muramidase layer and often spontaneous lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane (Bierbaum and Sahl, 1987). In fact, activation of autolysins in the cell wall of the Gram-positive bacteria has been observed in the presence of poly-l-lysine (Bierbaum and Sahl, 1985). In Gram-negative bacteria, the regulation of autolysins is not fully understood (H\u00f6ltje, 1995).",

            "text": "The antimicrobial activity of many defensins is diminished in the presence of salts, such as sodium chloride concentration at physiological concentrations (\u223c150 mM or 300 mOsm) or by various divalent cations or plasma proteins (Garc\u00eda et al., 2001, Goldman et al., 1997, Singh et al., 1998). Most likely, mono- or divalent cations inhibit by simple charge competition of the initial interaction between the cationic peptide and its anionic targets (Lehrer et al., 1993). This may depend on the bacterial species studied. Chicken AvBD9-mediated growth inhibition of E. coli and S. typhimurium was not affected in the presence of 20 mM sodium chloride, whereas growth inhibition of C. perfringens and S. aureus declined to \u223c50%. Thus, AvBD9 proved to be relatively salt-insensitive, as 24\u201349% growth inhibition was retained for most strains in the presence of 150 mM sodium chloride (van Dijk et al., 2007). Living in a salt water habitat, it was not surprising that the antibacterial activity of synthetic king penguin AvBD103b against E. coli and S. aureus was not affected by sodium chloride concentrations up to 160 mM (348 mOsm), which is close to the osmolarity measured in penguin stomach contents (324 mOsm) (Landon et al., 2004). This indicates that these peptides can retain their microbicidal activity in vivo in stomach contents and contribute to protection against food degrading microorganims. At 480 mM NaCl the efficacy against S. aureus decreased 16-fold and growth inhibition of E. coli decreased 2- and 4-fold in the presence of 1 and 50 mM MgCl2, respectively (Landon et al., 2004). Some \u03b2-defensins have the propensity to form oligomeric structures. The capacity to create stable dimers in solution has been suggested as a possible reason for the high and salt-independent antibacterial activity of hBD-3 (Schibli et al., 2002). The solution structure of AvBD103b obtained by NMR spectroscopy indicated a monomeric nature for this peptide, although the authors did not rule out the formation of a symmetrical dimer (Landon et al., 2004). Thus, despite the observations that oligomerization may enhance antimicrobial activity (Campopiano et al., 2004, Schibli et al., 2002), in the case of AvBD103b and hBD-3, high cationicity (10+ and 11+, respectively) and overall hydrophobicity (Kl\u00fcver et al., 2005) appears to be more important. Despite the demonstrated inactivation of some AMPs at physiological salt concentrations in vitro, AMP gene products correlate well with increased antimicrobial resistance in animal model experiments (Salzman et al., 2003). A possible explanation for this phenomenon was postulated by Dorschner et al. (2006), who suggested that bicarbonate, which is ubiquitously present in blood, sweat, and the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tracts, could enhance microbial susceptibility to AMP-mediated killing.",

Many questions remain to be answered. The relationship between copy number, gene polymorphisms and defensin gene repertoire with disease resistance need to be sorted out. The occurrence of elongated defensin-like genes, due to an additional large post-piece, in some human and avian defensins suggest biological functions other than direct antimicrobial activity for these molecules. Evidence is mounting that heterophils play an important role in avian innate immune defense against bacterial infections, but their defensin repertoire and the role of their extracellular and intracellular release, subsequent activation and regulation needs to be further investigated. Similarly, the tissue distribution and scarce data on upregulation of avian AMP expression is almost completely based on regulation at the transcriptional level. Therefore, additional research on translational regulation and post-translational processing and modifications should be performed and coupled to functional studies with respect to tissue-specific expression. Particularly the cloaca and surrounding tissues, where reproductive tract, B cell synthesis and intestinal contents converge, is an interesting subject for further studies. Increased knowledge about poultry defensin biological functions, their localization and regulation may aid in the selection of breeds that are less susceptible to colonization of pathogenic bacteria. Alternatively, local endogenous defensin expression levels may be stimulated via dietary modulation.",
