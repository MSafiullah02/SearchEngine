The COVID\u201019 pandemic has led to the necessary postponement of much planned surgical activity with the cancellation of outpatient, diagnostic and operative work.

There are essentially three modalities. The telephone is ubiquitous, cheap and resilient. Telephone consultations can be used for both new and returning patients and require no specialist information technology infrastructure or user training. Patients find it highly acceptable, and in some instances it is preferable to face to face consultations [1].",

Being able to see a live video image of the patient does add to the quality of the consultation by being able to see visual cues and body language. In addition, video consultations have been shown to reduce medication errors and improve diagnostic accuracy compared to the telephone [2]. Newer video consultation systems, such as Attend Anywhere (NHS NearMe), offer a more accessible and managed video consultation system. Consultations can be conducted on any digital device: phone, tablet or personal computer. It does not require patients to download an application and the system requires limited bandwidth to run. The potential savings of both travel time and cost are huge when comparing remote consultation to face to face [3].",

The use of video consultation as a tool for education in healthcare has been established [4] but the potential opportunities offered by such technology are only now becoming evident. Healthy patient volunteers who are used in medical education by universities nationwide are being asked to stay at home to reduce their risk of exposure, yet this resource of ready trained assistance can still be tapped for both training and assessment using video consultation software.",
