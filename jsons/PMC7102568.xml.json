            "text": "Bacteria and viruses are the most important pathogens on earth. While most bacteria can be directly eliminated with antibiotics, viruses can only be constrained in their growth, posing a challenge for treatment. This observation is a direct consequence of the fact that viruses are composed of only nucleic acids, proteins, sometimes lipids and a few other compounds. Thus, the survival of viruses is almost entirely dependent on molecular protein-protein interactions (PPI) with their hosts. Furthermore, viral variation occurs rapidly, often with significant adaptation within each host [1]. Hence, strategies for the development of safe antivirals often depend on precise targeting of virus-host PPIs and a deep understanding of viral biology.",

Given the vast body of literature about virus-host interactions, we primarily base our review on data of human host-virus interactions available in public databases. Although extensive sequence information from next-generation sequencing studies exists, precise knowledge of virus-host PPIs and thus potential targets for antiviral therapies is rather limited, biased and incomplete. Medically important viruses such as HIV and Influenza have received considerable research attention, while other highly infectious viruses have received relatively little attention, as their spread is geographically limited and focused on a narrow range of hosts. Furthermore, their investigation may prove experimentally difficult or accelerated only recently. For example, the Zika threat is relatively recent, having triggered much research activity only in the last few years.",

Unsurprisingly, some viruses received a lot of attention. For example, both HIV and Influenza claim a large number of victims and impose a significant economic burden. In turn, viruses such as Hepatitis, MERS and SARS claim relatively few lives, yet come with a considerable economic price tag (Table 1\n).",

Such investigations are especially informative for RNA viruses that evolve rapidly, resulting in large sequence diversity. In Table 2\n, we summarize the 20 most studied virus families as a function of the number of sequenced genomes. Notably, we find more than 7,000 genomes of flaviviridae that include the Zika virus. Furthermore, we count more than 2,000 genomes of retroviridae, including the HIV virus. Sequences of flaviviridae and retroviridae are highly variable, as more than 200,000 sequences in both families cannot be clustered into similar sub-groups. In particular, we applied a similarity threshold of 98% sequence identity with the tool CD-HIT-EST [2], considering genomes with more than 98% sequence identity as a single cluster (Table 2). Cluster representatives are assumed to be the longest sequence in each 98%-similar group. When available, complete genomes from RefSeq viral and neighbor complete genomes [3] are considered cluster representatives.",

As only five body habitats were screened, including nose, skin, mouth, vagina, and stool, most people likely carry dozens of different viruses. However, only a few lead to clinical symptoms or disease. Furthermore, Poon et al. [5] found numerous variants of Influenza A in individual human hosts. Such variants showed changing abundance over time and between individuals, reflecting their ability to evolve and adapt quickly to changing hosts and conditions.",

As a consequence of many high-throughput screens, databases of PPIs have been filled with tens of thousands of virus-human interactions. The IMEx (International Molecular Exchange) consortium of databases has been particularly valuable, as members use a standard format (PSI-MS) for recording meta-data for PPIs [18], including experimental details. IMEx members and observers include, notably, BioGRID [19], DIP [20], IntAct [21] and MINT [22] (Table 3\n). Other generalist PPI databases [23] also collect host-virus interactions but are not further discussed here. Specialized web-based resources have been developed to integrate molecular pathogen-host interactions (PHI) and related data from these PPI databases (generic as well as PHI databases are shown in Table 3).",

Especially the lack of experimental details may obscure the nature of an interaction as direct or \u201cindirect\u201d, e.g. when a protein is co-purified with other proteins without additional evidence whether it is directly binding to specific members of such a complex. For instance, out of the over 17,000 HIV-1 \u2013 human PPIs reported in HIV-1db [26] as of August, 2017, fewer than 7,000 are physical interactions, and the number of direct (rather than \u201ccomplexed\u201d) interactions is unclear. While clear evidence of direct physical interaction is provided for some PPIs (e.g. \u201cbinds\u201d, \u201cphosphorylates\u201d, \u201ccleaves\u201d), the evidence is weaker for others. Compared to PSI-MS standards, these evidence descriptors were generally more ambiguous. Using a strict set of criteria, the number of physical and direct PPIs between HIV-1 and human proteins is about 1,600. Out of the additional \u223c 5,400 physical interactions, the majority have neither evidence for nor against a direct interaction (e.g. \u201cinteracts with\u201d, \u201cstabilizes\u201d, \u201crecruits\u201d). While NCBI\u2019s HIV-1DB is an invaluable resource for HIV-1 researchers, \u201cmining\u201d physical PPIs from the entire database confidently without manual inspection or natural language processing can be difficult.",

In addition to data storage, VirusMentha and PHIDIAS [29] offer certain visualization and analysis tools. In addition, PHI databases may contain interactions that are not present in generalist PPI databases as a result of exhaustive mining of pathogen-specific data and literature. The most recent update of VirHostNet contains nearly 22,000 virus-human PPIs, of which 14,000 are direct. However, this diversity of source data does present some drawbacks. Many PHI databases lack a standard (i.e. PSI-MS) format (except HPIDB), making inference about the molecular details of interactions such as evidence codes challenging. Furthermore, filtering criteria for collecting virus-host PPIs are often difficult or impossible to ascertain. Finally, the update cycles can be irregular, and often the underlying pipelines for collecting data change from one version to the next. Generally, host-virus protein interaction data in the above PHI databases are integrated mainly from more general PPI databases using automatic integration tools such as PSICQUIC [30] and by manual literature curation. Hence, we excluded PHI databases that do not follow PSI-MS standards from a deeper analysis.",

Not surprisingly, our understanding of human-virus PPIs is highly biased towards a few well-studied viruses. For instance, only 5 viruses have more than 1,000 physical interactions, such as Influenza A with 3,746, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) with 3,163, HIV-1 with 2,540, Herpesvirus 8 with 1,643, and Hepatitis C with 1,082. Notably, Influenza, HIV and Hepatitis viruses were among the most economic burdensome pathogens (Table 1). The human papilloma viruses totaled 4,645 interactions across 29 different species. Evidence for direct interactions of these top viruses varied, but was notably high for herpesvirus 8 (1,623 direct /1,643 physical) and HIV-1 (2,365 direct /2,540 physical). Considering whole virus families (Table 4\n), we found a total of 5,957 physical interactions with human host proteins involving proteins of orthomyxoviridae. As indicated previously, such sets of interactions are often dominated by a single virus. In addition, we obtained 462 interactions for virus families with fewer than 100 PPIs. In Fig. 1\n, we summarized the sets of human proteins that were targeted by different virus families and their substantial overlap. While these numbers are roughly similar, the corresponding virus families represent vastly different genome sizes and virus diversity. For instance, HIV encodes only about 10 proteins with more than 100 interactions per virus protein. EBV, by comparison, encodes about 85 proteins leading to \u201conly\u201d 20 interactions per virus protein on average. On a more quantitative level, the number of interactions between proteins of the human host and viruses that belong to a certain family correlate significantly with the presence of different genomes in a given virus family (Fig. 2\n). Before we can even begin to interpret these interactions, we need to ask if it is biologically meaningful or even possible if a virus protein has >100 interactions (see below).",

However, they rigorously filtered their interaction data to obtain a \u201ccore\u201d data set of 497 PPIs. Such a set was then compared to literature-curated PPIs in VirusMint [38], that were mostly derived from small-scale targeted studies. Notably, the overlap was only 19 interactions. As another control, J\u00e4ger et al. also carried out their purifications in two different cell lines, HEK293 and Jurkat, yet only 196 out of 497 interactions were found in both (39%). Finally, J\u00e4ger et al. compared their interaction data with four published RNAi screens [36,[39], [40], [41]] that found a total of 1,071 human genes, of which only 55 overlapped with the 435 proteins found by AP/MS. In a follow-up study, Emig-Agius et al. [42] identified a set of 554 human proteins with \u201cclose proximity\u201d to HIV proteins in both AP/MS data and RNAi screens. That is, 382 were direct HIV interactors identified by AP-MS, 79 were identified directly by RNAi, and 148 were novel predictions identified by proximity in the interaction network. These 554 human proteins were also enriched for 40 protein complexes from the CORUM database of human protein complexes [43]. Out of these 40 complexes, 27 had not been reported in previous studies of HIV, while the remaining 13 complexes had been identified by at least one previously published analysis. Furthermore, 36 of the 40 complexes in the map had at least one subunit that directly interacted with HIV. As a result they found three protein complexes which had not been identified in previous analyses. Additional RNAi experiments confirmed that some subunits were required for efficient HIV infection.",

            "text": "The sheer number of host-virus interactions that have been found for many viruses may suggest that we have identified most if not all interactions. As indicated above, we know from other studies that interaction screens likely contain a large number of false positives. While viral proteins are highly enriched for disordered regions that are known to favor interactions with many partners [45], the question remains as to how many interactions does a virus realistically utilize to infect its host? How do we identify the physiological interactions among those that have been found overall? Unfortunately, such estimates currently do not exist, especially if we assume that viruses of similar proteome size may use similar numbers of PPIs. While it is hard to estimate such numbers for human viruses, bacteriophages may serve as a simpler model: 50 years of research have identified about 30 host-virus interactions between E. coli and phage lambda, which encode \u223c4,000 and 73 proteins, respectively [46]. Assuming that most (physiologically relevant) host-virus interactions in this system have been identified, a large-scale analysis of E. coli-lambda interactions revealed 62 interactions in a high-confidence set [47]. However, of the 62 high-confidence PPIs only two were previously known to be physiological, while the role of the other 60 remains unknown. Such observations may indicate that up to 97% of these PPIs are false positives. However, lambda is unusual as compared to other phage in that many lambda proteins are processed during maturation and thus interactions are more difficult to detect. Protein processing seems to be less common among other phages, such as T7, whose 55 proteins are known to be involved in only 15 interactions with its host [46]. For T7 and lambda about 30\u201340 interactions have been found between their virion proteins, which are easier to detect and possibly more abundant than in human viruses, given the more elaborate virus structure in these tailed phage when compared to the often simple-structured human viruses. Although lambda and T7 may not be the most meaningful references for human viruses they give us a sense for the complexity of the problem. Interestingly, human viruses include many cases with substantial proteolytic processing, such as Hepatitis C Virus, in which a polyprotein prevents many interactions that are found when the proteolytic fragments are used for interaction screens [48].",

            "text": "Clearly, virus proteins target a relatively select number of human proteins that are relevant for their replication. These human targets appear to be highly connected: the mean degree of these targets was 38 vs. 10 in non-targeted proteins [53]. Even among highly connected proteins (degree k>5) in the human interactome, the degree of virus targets was twice as large as those of non-targeted proteins. Independent analyses found that viral proteins preferably target human host proteins that are involved in a large number of interactions [14,49,50,[54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]]. As the number of interactions is a local measure of centrality, other more global measures of centrality were considered as well. In particular, betweenness centrality measures how many connections go through a particular protein in a network when proteins were mutually connected through their shortest paths. Indeed, various viruses target human host proteins with high betweenness centrality. As a corollary, such central proteins also have significantly shorter paths to other proteins [14,49,50,[54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]], as well as participate in a higher number of pathways and protein complexes [61]. Furthermore, topological analyses of revealed that human host proteins that were targeted by viruses are strongly connected among each other [61]. Recently, the focus of modern network research has shifted to the determination of nodes that allow the topological control of a network [62,63]. Such controlling nodes need to be tweaked to exert the behavior of the remaining nodes in the underlying network. Notably, such controlling genes were enriched with essential genes and disease genes, and they appeared in regulatory interactions [64,65]. Furthermore, they also played a role as targeted and required genes of viral infections [66,67]. As a consequence, such centrality measures and the determination of control nodes may allow the computational prediction of potential viral targets based on topological measures [57,58,[68], [69], [70]].",

While several studies have addressed this question, we illustrate the idea with a study of human papilloma viruses (HPV). Neveu et al. [71] tested the interactions of two HPV proteins, E6 and E7, derived from 11 different strains each against 94 and 88 human target proteins, respectively. Each protein often had surprisingly different interaction profiles, depending on the strain from which they were derived. For instance, the affinity of different E6 proteins from different strains for their cellular targets Smad2 and Smad3 differed by more than 10-fold (as measured by an in vitro luciferase protein complementation assay). Interestingly, these authors also showed that the target proteins had very distinct tissue-specific expression profiles, partly explaining the tissue specificity of these viruses. In a complementary study, Gulbahce et al. [72] also investigated the E6 and E7 proteins but focused on the effect these proteins had on the expression levels in different target cells. Both proteins interacted with different proteins but also affected the expression of very different target proteins in human fibroblast and keratinocytes, emphasizing the complexities that arise when virus variation and human cell types are combined.",

However, in most cases adaptive mutations for one host bring about a decrease in fitness for replicating within another host, with a possible exception when a host\u2019s population tends to fluctuate widely [73]. Most viruses require only one host although some viruses (notably arboviruses such as dengue) use humans and other animals as \u201cdead-end\u201d hosts that do not transmit the virus to others in the population [74]. For obligate multi-host viruses, a phenotype specific to each host is often developed, which increases the chances of transmission. The hosts themselves are often very different, in terms of pH, temperature, and cell type. Thus, it is likely that PPIs from obligate multi-host viruses are more diverse than PPIs from optional multi-host viruses.",

The most common alternate hosts were simian, avian, mouse, cow and pig. There were over 100 interactions between the 2006 h5n1 pandemic flu strain and chicken. However, there were even some interactions with bacterial and plant hosts (for herpesviral proteins). In all, there were 434 physical interactions, of which 186 were direct. Conversely, non-human viruses were also found to have PPIs with human proteins, with less diversity but overall higher interactions. These 39 non-human viruses were from 15 different viral families, of which only 7 were present in Table 4. 627 physical and 525 direct PPIs were found. This greater number of PPIs may be a result of the larger human proteome compared to most alternative hosts. The non-human hosts were similar in both directions of the analysis. However, some differences could be found. Canine viruses were found to have interactions in human, although human viruses were not found to have interactions in canine species. On the other hand, non-human viruses did not come from any bacterial or plant hosts.",

Using U.S. Medicare patient medical history data derived from 13 million patients, Gulbahce et al. found that many diseases were often associated with infections of the underlying viruses. For instance, patients that suffered from an infection with the human papilloma virus had 15.7 and 2.7 times increased chance of developing retina and bladder cancer and a higher risk of Fanconi anemia [72].

While MYC has diverse effects on numerous target genes that it regulates, E4ORF1 induces MYC to activate a subset of glycolytic targets (viruses with a deletion of the E4 protein are defective for inducing glycolysis). Thai et al. [81] conclusively demonstrated that adenovirus induced glycolysis generates metabolites for increased nucleotide biosynthesis in infected cells. Furthermore, Rami\u00e8re et al. determined a direct interaction between the NS5A of the Hepatitis C virus and cellular hexokinase 2 through protein complementation assays and co-immunoprecipitation. Notably, NS5A expression was sufficient to enhance glucose consumption and lactate secretion. Indicating a direct point of influence on a hosts metabolism through a host-virus protein interaction, viruses putatively manipulate host metabolism to generate more nucleotides and other compounds that are needed for their replication [82]. However, in most host-virus system viral points of metabolic intervention are understudied, and ambiguity remains whether interactions of virus proteins with host enzymes directly or indirectly reprogram metabolism.",

In turn, for many viruses of lesser medical importance only few interactions are known that are not sufficient to understand their infection mechanisms at this point. Notably, viruses evolve much quicker than their hosts, especially in RNA viruses, not the least because they can produce numerous (variant) virus particles by the time the host can mount an immune response.

However, such interactions will need to be determined in experimental settings that account for the presence of different pathogens. Such settings will allow the assessment of synergies and interactions between pathogens that putatively have a physiological effect on the host as well as only appear as a consequence of a co-infection. The relationships between diseases that are triggered by host-virus protein interactions and other non-viral comorbidities are increasingly investigated. As a corollary of the previous point, knowledge about such systems is mostly based on assembling and analyzing interaction interfaces that were found independently from the presence of other diseases as well. As a consequence, host-virus interaction interfaces may change in the presence of other diseases. In turn, host-virus interactions may facilitate the emergence of comorbidities, suggesting that host-virus interaction interfaces need to be experimentally assessed in the presence of associated diseases.",

In the course of these studies, we will also find many more commensal viruses which do interact with their human host but may actually be beneficial, and potentially even help us to fight other pathogens and parasites.",
