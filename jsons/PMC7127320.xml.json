These mathematical models included not just the traditional epidemiologic models but also the newer approach of phylogenetic analysis applied to partial or whole viral genomes.

The most common cause of hospitalization is lower respiratory tract infection, including croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Manifestations involving the central nervous system may be observed, including encephalopathy, postinfluenza encephalitis, transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and acute necrotizing encephalitis. Myositis often occurs 3 days (range, 0\u201318 days) after onset of illness. In young infants, influenza can mimic generalized sepsis. Myocarditis is a rare complication. Epidemiologically, most deaths occur in infants and the elderly (>65 years old) during the annual influenza epidemics as a result of decreased immunity against influenza virus infection. The mortality curve typically presents with a U shape when age-specific excess mortality caused by pneumonia and seasonal influenza is plotted.17\n",

One well-investigated example of this has been the effects of school closure on the subsequent progression of an influenza pandemic. Various mathematical modeling studies have suggested that, although there may be some delay in the spread of the pandemic from closing schools, this measure will only be effective if the subsequent behavior of children outside the school does not result in a similar number of contacts and that such relative isolation is prolonged during the pandemic period. However, the social and economic disruption for the working parents with such a strategy may be difficult to overcome because at least one parent will have to take time off work to look after young children at home. In particular, school closure has to be part of an overall mitigation strategy, including the treatment and home isolation of infected individuals to reduce further contacts.15\n",

Such understanding allows more effective public health surveillance of seasonal human influenza viruses, as well as candidate pandemic viruses that may cross the species barrier from animals to humans. Development in antiviral drugs for influenza is still slow (compared with rapid advances and the variety in the case of anti\u2013human immunodeficiency virus drugs), but this is counterbalanced by the effective and highly organized and regulated vaccine-manufacturing base that is already in existence for the seasonal influenza vaccines. Unlike infectious agents that infect humans only (such as smallpox and measles), influenza viruses, being zoonotic (with animal and human reservoirs), will continue to pose a persistent and variable threat to human health for the foreseeable future. It is therefore important that systems are in place, in health care institutions and in the general community, to react and adapt quickly to limit human morbidity and mortality caused by this ever-changing pathogen.",
