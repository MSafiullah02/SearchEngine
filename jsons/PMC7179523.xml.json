Human pathogenic CoVs include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) [5, 6, 7]. Human pathogenic CoVs are associated with a wide range of respiratory illnesses, including common colds, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis [7]. Additionally, several studies have described that CoVs are associated with CNS diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis [8, 9, 10]. Respiratory tract infection contributes to high morbidity and mortality with a worldwide disease burden estimated at 112,900,000 disability-adjusted life years and 3.5 million deaths [11]. Furthermore, the mortality of viral encephalitis ranges from 4.6 to 29% and nearly 50% of survivors are at a high risk of developing neurological disorders [12].",

            "text": "The effect of CoV infection is influenced by various factors, including environmental factors, genetic factors, and immune-mediated process [10]. Cytokines are widely recognized as important mediators of inflammatory response [13]. For instance, IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces the terminal differentiation of proliferating B cells to plasma cells, stimulates antibody secretion, and enhances T-lymphocyte responses in secondary lymphoid organs [14]. Further, IL-8 is a C-X-C chemokine that functions as a potent chemotactic agent for polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes [15] and is associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown [16]. MCP-1 is a C-C chemokine that can initiate the transmigration of monocytes across the blood-brain barrier [16]. Several studies have shown that IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 contribute to severe respiratory disease progression in SARS infections [17, 18, 19]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) expression is often induced during CoV infections, resulting in systemic (i.e., in the plasma) and local increases in inflammatory fluids either in mice or humans, such as patients with rheumatoid arthritis and severe respiratory syncytial virus infection [20, 21, 22]. Recent studies have suggested that granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also has proinflammatory functions and plays critical roles in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis [23, 24].",

A total of 183 hospitalized children with clinically suspected acute encephalitis and 236 children with acute respiratory tract infection were enrolled from May 2014 to April 2015 at the Children's Hospital of Chenzhou (Hunan Province, China). On the day of admission, blood samples were collected from patients with respiratory tract infection and paired samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid were collected from patients with clinically suspected acute encephalitis. Then, to exclude bacteria, fungus, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection from subsequent data analysis, 1 ml of cerebrospinal fluid specimens were subjected to microbiological investigations. Control blood samples were collected from age-matched children (n = 26) without infection who underwent surgery. The patients' clinical data were collected for further analysis. The study's protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital for Human Studies and written consent forms were obtained from the parents of the participants. The course of illness was defined in this study as the period from the onset of symptoms to the disappearance of symptoms.",

Since there was no significant difference in the age of patients with CoV-CNS infection, CoV-respiratory tract infection, and healthy controls, the difference in immune blood cell counts between CNS and respiratory tract infection could not be attributed to the difference in patient age, but rather to the difference in the nature of CoV tropism.",

            "text": "We observed a significant increase in the serum G-CSF level in patients with either CoV-CNS or CoV-respiratory tract infections. G-CSF is one of the key regulators of granulocytosis, which plays a central role in stimulating the proliferation of granulocytic precursors, enhances their terminal differentiation, and stimulates their release from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood [20]. In addition, GM-CSF stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and monocytes [26]. Our results showed that (1) CoV-CNS infection induces a high level of GM-CSF either in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, and (2) peripheral cell counts of neutrophil cells and monocytes were significantly higher in patients with CoV-CNS infection than in patients with CoV-respiratory tract infection and healthy controls. These findings may suggest that GM-CSF plays an important role in controlling CNS infection through inducing neutrophils and monocyte proliferation and/or accumulation in the infection site [27]. To our knowledge, GM-CSF can promote leukocyte chemotaxis and adhesion, upregulate the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils as a secondary immune response to the virus, and provide protection against viral encephalitis [28, 29, 30]. In addition, the increased neutrophils can afford protection against viral infection. Several reports have implied direct roles for them in the targeting of infected cells or virions: neutrophils can adhere to infected cells after complement activation and phagocytose antibody-coated virions [31, 32]. However, this issue needs to be further investigated through in vitro studies examining the production of GM-CSF from blood cells isolated from patients with CoV-CNS.",

However, we found that IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were significantly accumulated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with CoV-CNS infection. IL-6 has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects and can increase blood-brain barrier permeability [33]. A high level of IL-6 leads to progressive neurological disorders with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [34]. The higher level of cerebrospinal fluid IL-8 seen in this study is consistent with the fact that CNS viral infection might induce proliferation of microglia and astrocytes, resulting in the release of IL-8 [35]. An experimental Japanese encephalitis mouse model demonstrated that IL-8 plays an important role in inflammatory responses involving injury to the brain [36]. MCP-1 is a C-C chemokine that can initiate the transmigration of monocytes across the blood-brain barrier and recruit inflammatory cells into the CNS, thereby facilitating the entry of virus-infected cells, as well as amplifying the inflammatory response, which damage the brain [16, 37]. These accumulated cytokines may also contribute to immune damage in the CNS of patients with CoV infection similar to that observed in other viral encephalitis.",
