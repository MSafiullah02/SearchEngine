Most of these are likely to also represent serotypes explaining life-long susceptibility to RV infections.\n9\nDifferences in association of RV species with disease have been observed, with RV-A and the recently discovered RV-C responsible for more severe lower respiratory tract illnesses.\n10\n11\n12\nHRV-A and HRV-B can be grown in standard laboratory cell lines enabling isolation from clinical samples and classification according to neutralizing antibody responses (serotypes). This occurred in the 1960s and 1970s and led to the identification of approximately 100 strains. HRV-C was only discovered in 2006,\n13\nas they could not be cultured using standard techniques and hence has gone unappreciated as a pathogen. HRV-C has now been shown to infect both the youngest children and to cause the most severe acute RV-induced lower respiratory tract disease.\n12\nOnce researchers were able to culture HRV-C using respiratory mucosal explants or air\u2013liquid interface differentiated bronchial epithelium, they determined that it used the human transmembrane protein, cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) for virus binding and replication.\n14\nSerendipitously, it had recently been shown that there were four distinct alleles associated with CDHR3 expression, with one of these representing a single nucleotide polymorphism (G\u2192A) that converts a residue cysteine to tyrosine at position 529 (Cys\n529\n\u2192Tyr, rs6967330). This leads to a rare, but phenotypically dominant, asthma-related A-encoded Tyr529 variant of the\nCDHR3\ngene that was linked to greater airway epithelial cell (AEC)-surface expression of CDHR3, and an increased risk of wheezing illnesses and hospitalizations for children 2 to 5 years.\n15\n16\nBochkov et al then went on to show that compared with wild-type CDHR3, cells transfected with the asthma susceptible CDHR3-Y529 variant had a 10-fold increase in HRV-C binding, increasing infectious virus yields.\n14\nThese findings are the first to link genetic susceptibility to respiratory tract infection with the development of childhood asthma.\n",

Children who develop sensitization to multiple aeroallergens at a younger age are more prone to develop severe acute asthma needing hospitalization.\n17\nThe relationship between virus infection and allergic sensitization was elegantly demonstrated by the investigators of the Childhood Origins of Asthma study (COAST) study who showed that children sensitized to aeroallergens and who wheezed with RV during the first 3 years of life had the greatest risk for developing asthma.\n18\nThe investigators went on to demonstrate that there was a sequential relationship with allergic sensitization leading to viral wheezing, especially wheezing was associated with RV, but there was no evidence that viral wheezing itself led to allergic sensitization.\n19\nIn fact, the impact of RV infection on early life has been the subject of a meta-analysis of 15 original studies, 10 reported on the results of 4 longitudinal cohort studies with different follow-up periods. RV wheezing illness in the first 3 years of life was associated with an increased risk of wheezing/asthma in later life (relative risk [RR] = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.62\u20132.49,\np\n < 0.001). In subgroup analysis done by age at follow-up, the association was significant in those <10 years (RR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.70\u20132.39,\np\n < 0.001) and \u226510 years (RR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.36\u20132.72,\np\n < 0.001).\n20\nTherefore, as has been seen with RSV, it is a host susceptibility linked to atopy, as demonstrated by a family history of allergic asthma that confers a significant risk of RV-induced wheeze. The impact of viral infection in early life and the role this then plays in the inception of asthma was best summarized by Gern and Busse, when they stated \u201csevere infections at this stage can result in 2 non-exclusive outcomes, the first being that they may impair normal lung development and the second being that they may trigger wheezing illnesses in susceptible individuals.\u201d\n21\n",

Our understanding of respiratory microbiota has changed with the advent of culture-independent techniques involving high-throughput sequencing of the\n16S rRNA\ngene, a highly conserved locus of the bacterial genome. This has revealed a complex microbial community that varies between states of health and respiratory disease.\n25\nA relationship between bacterial colonization and early-life asthma was first demonstrated in the Copenhagen birth cohort that showed a heightened risk of wheeze and asthma in children whose nasopharynx was colonized with\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n,\nMoraxella catarrhalis\n, and\nHaemophilus influenzae\nat 1 month of age, These same bacteria were also present during acute episodes of wheeze associated with viral infections and conferred a similar degree of risk for acute wheeze.\n26\n",

They speculated that infants are likely to be colonized initially with skin bacteria from their parents and these populations are replaced over time by\nMoraxella\nor\nAlloiococcus\n. This upper respiratory microbiota then remains stable over time in healthy individuals. However, in infants who had virus respiratory infections, there was a greater abundance of\nStreptococcus\n,\nMoraxella\n, and\nHaemophilus.\nWhile early\nMoraxella\ncolonization was associated with a younger age for the first viral upper respiratory infection,\nStreptococcus\ncolonization was associated with earlier initial lower respiratory infection. The level of subsequent asthma risk then was found to inversely relate to the age at which initial\nStreptococcus\ncolonization occurred. The investigators speculated that lower airway infection with RSV or RV contributes to an altered microbe featuring\nStreptococcus\nand the resulting effect on the airway and/or developing immune system predisposes to the development of asthma.\n27\nThis intriguing area obviously requires further work, but it is fascinating to see how exposure in early life to pathogens, either viral or bacterial can alter both the airways and immune response so profoundly.\n",

            "text": "\nThe hygiene hypothesis was developed to explain the relationship between microbial exposure in early life and protection against allergic and autoimmune diseases that continue to increase in prevalence particularly in westernized societies. It proposed that improvements in housing and changes to an urban lifestyle may be responsible for a lack of exposure to bacterial pathogens in early life resulting in an immune response that becomes skewed to the development of hypersensitivity and allergy.\n28\n29\nApart from infection, exposure to multiple bacterial antigens can occur from the indoor and outdoor environment. Bacterial products, such lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin, are recognized as foreign by the innate immune system and their exposure, especially in early life activates a developing immune system. In support of this concept, high-level chronic exposure to LPS has been shown experimentally to induce immune tolerance.\n30\nThis hypothesis was supported by German investigators who examined samples of dust from the mattresses of children and then related the levels of endotoxin to the prevalence of asthma and allergies and to serum levels of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). They found that children exposed to \u201cfarm dust,\u201d containing high levels of LPS were associated with a significant decrease in the risk of hay fever, atopic sensitization, atopic asthma, and atopic wheeze in childhood.\n31\nThis work has been supported by strong epidemiological studies confirming early-life exposure to farming and bacterial LPS significantly reduces the risk of asthma.\n31\n32\nRecently, the mechanisms behind this regulation have started to be understood, with AECs and the regulator protein, A20, playing a key role.\n33\nA20 is a deubiquitinase that is an essential negative regulator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation and the subsequent induction of inflammatory responses.\n34\nA20 forms a unique ubiquitin-editing complex with other proteins that is required for the activation of NF-\u03baB.\n35\nA20 knockout mice are highly susceptible to exposure to inflammatory mediators and LPS.\n36\nRecently, an important role has emerged for A20 in the regulation of early asthma. Mice when exposed to low levels of LPS in early life do not develop features of asthma, despite sensitization to house dust mite (HDM). Using knockout mice with selective A20 deficiency in the AECs, the protective effect of LPS was diminished, with increased epithelial expression of inflammatory mediators, chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand (CCL)-20 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) following HDM.\n36\nIn human AECs, LPS treatment also blunted the inflammatory response (CCL-20, GM-CSF, and interleukin [IL]-1\u03b1) following HDM exposure.\n37\nBringing these findings together, Schuijs et al demonstrated that LPS-exposed epithelial cell cytokines are responsible for activating dendritic cells (DCs), and suppressing type 2 immunity to HDM, while loss of the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 in lung epithelium abolished this protective effect. They also demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding A20 was associated with allergy and asthma risk in children growing up on farms.\n33\n",

While 91% of subjects developed a cold, the majority did not develop acute asthma and treatment with nebulized IFN-\u03b2 overall did not result in a significant improvement. However, in those with poor control despite treatment, \u201ccold\u201d symptoms led to a greater worsening in asthma and nebulized IFN-\u03b2 led to a significant attenuation. This may be partly explained by alterations in the immune system due to active inflammation since atopic children have been shown to be particularly at risk of more severe viral exacerbations, and this is mitigated by anti-IgE therapy.\n62\nOther risk factors that require further exploration include low vitamin D levels and higher levels of stress. It is suspected that these both play their part in reducing immunity against viral infection, contributing to risk of exacerbation.\n27\nResultant higher levels of viral replication and insufficient IFN production and the associated airway inflammation that occurs concurrently could certainly explain this propensity for frequent exacerbations.\n",

As acute events, these infections are enough to trigger recurring episodes of wheeze (particularly with recurrent RV infections), are likely to influence permanently lung development, and in those susceptible, predispose to the development of asthma in later life. In established asthma, viruses remain important triggers of acute exacerbations, with those most susceptible tending to have either pre-existent poor asthma control or more severe underlying asthma. The reason for this susceptibility to respiratory virus infection remains unclear, but is very clearly closely related to the imbalanced inflammatory process active in asthma that can involve impaired type I/III IFN production coupled with excessive expression of cytokines that activate neutrophilic and type-2/eosinophilic inflammatory pathways (\nFig. 1\n). Originally thought to be primarily involved in control of viral replication, there is growing evidence that type I IFN is also an important negative regulator of inflammation. The role of the airway epithelium as the site of viral replication and initiator of the inflammatory pathways that cause exacerbations is now well established. Given the diversity of viruses that can precipitate an asthma exacerbation, antivirals and vaccines are unlikely to be feasible treatment options. As a result, research is now focused on redressing the asthmatic airway epithelial innate immune response to viral infection.\n",

            "text": "Fig. 1: \nInnate and adaptive immune responses to respiratory virus infections in the airways. Under normal circumstances the innate immune response to virus infection is triggered by infection of airway epithelial cells and recognition of viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by both the infected epithelium and resident immune cells. These cells contain various pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognise a diverse range of PAMPs and elicit innate then adaptive immune responses to eliminate virus infections. Viral dsRNA are recognised by RIG I, MDA5 or TLR3 receptors whiles sRNA are mainly sensed by TLR7/8. Various DNA viruses are recognised by cytoplasmic DNA sensors; cGAS, DDX41 or by endosomal TLR9. Upon recognition downstream signaling cascades are initiated to produce type I interferons via IRF3/7 activation that induces antiviral proteins that inhibit viral replication within infected cells and spread to neighboring cells. Inflammatory cytokines production via NF-kB activation, results in release of IL-6, CXCL8 and the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages. Infected cells release IL-15 that activates NK cells that produce IFN-\u03b2 and that target infected cells. This supports a robust Th1 environment for recruitment of TH-1 and type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC-1), resulting in viral clearance. In asthma there is a pre-existent state of active airway inflammation. In the case of active type 2 inflammation, the presence of increased type 2 lymphocytes, both TH-2 cells and Ilc-2 cells promote this abnormal state. Following infection of the asthmatic epithelium there is heightened release of IL-25/IL-33 and TSLP that further activate ILC2 cells. Activated ILC2s and Th2 cells largely produce more IL-4/13 and IL-5 all of which activate other inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and this results in worsened inflammation of the airways. IL-4/13 also enhance the IgE production by B lymphocytes which may further impair activation of the innate immune cells such as dendritic cells to virus infection. Increased expression of type 2 cytokines, TGF-\u03b2 and SOCS1/3 negatively regulates type I interferon production while type 2 cytokines also enhance ICAM-1 expression all of which results increased virus replication.\n",
