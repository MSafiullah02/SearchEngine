Chronic bronchitis usually results from smoking-related obstructive disease. Although many elderly patients with chronic bronchitis may be ex-smokers, age-related decline in lung function can also precipitate COPD symptoms. In elderly patients with chronic bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) are common. AECB is defined as worsening shortness of breath and cough and/or sputum production that cannot be accounted for by daily variability and requires a change in therapy. AECB can lead to poor quality of life, loss of functional status, hospitalizations, loss of lung function, and more often fatality in elderly patients. Risk factors for AECB include respiratory infection, environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution), and poor compliance with prescribed COPD therapies. Lower respiratory tract infection often triggers AECB accounting for 80% of all episodes. Viral infections, including influenza, parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses, account for 30% of exacerbations and are associated with superimposed bacterial infections as well. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common pathogens in mild cases of AECB and account for 40-60% of cases. In more severe cases of AECB requiring mechanical ventilation, enteric gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas spp. have been identified.

The overall rate of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in persons aged 65-69 years ranges from 18.2 cases per 1,000 person-years to 52.3 cases per 1,000 person-years among those aged \u00b3 85 years, resulting in an estimate of 915,900 episodes per year of CAP in adults \u00b3 65 years in the United States (2) . For residents of nursing homes age 65 years and older, the rate of nursing home acquired pneumonia (NHAP) is as high as 365 cases per 1,000 person-years (5) . Pneumonia is classified into four categories: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospitalacquired pneumonia (HAP), nursing home acquired pneumonia (NHAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). CAP and HAP are differentiated as pneumonia that develops while a patient is in an outpatient or inpatient setting, respectively. VAP is defined as pneumonia arising after the patient has received at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation. NHAP occurs in nursing home residents that acquire pneumonia while residing in the nursing home. Since an increasing number of patients, especially elderly patients, utilize rehabilitation facilities, outpatient surgical centers, and dialysis centers, pneumonia acquired by patients utilizing these facilities is considered HCAP.

However, in older adults, there is a higher frequency of silent aspiration, particularly in those with dementia and stroke. Physiologic changes such as a decrease in elastic recoil of the lung, a decrease in compliance of the chest wall, a decrease in respiratory muscle strength, calcification within the rib cage, osteoporosis and resultant vertebral fractures, decreased mucociliary clearance rates, and swallowing difficulty are all associated with aging. In addition, older adults tend to be colonized in the upper respiratory tract with more virulent pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (11) .

Tachypnea (respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min) and tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min) were seen in two-thirds of elderly patients with pneumonia, and these signs may precede other clinical features by 3-4 days. Many elderly patients, particularly those that are chronically debilitated, may present with very subtle clinical manifestations such as an aggravation of preexisting comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, CHF), unexplained falls, failure to thrive, and poor appetite (11) . In older patients, L. pneumophila is a frequent cause of an atypical pneumonia syndrome presenting with constitutional symptoms myalgias, diarrhea, altered mental status, bradycardia, and hyponatremia.

Physical examination findings (e.g., bronchial breath sounds, rales) are important but less sensitive and specific than chest radiograph findings. Older adults may lack clinical features and/or physical examination findings. Therefore, a chest radiograph is important to differentiate CAP from acute bronchitis in an older adult. Routine diagnostic tests to identify an etiologic agent are optional for outpatients with CAP since most patients do well with empirical antibiotic therapy. Pretreatment blood cultures and an expectorated sputum specimen for Gram stain and culture are standard samples to obtain. However, pretreatment blood cultures only identified a probable pathogen in 5-14% of patients with CAP. Yield from blood cultures is highest in patients with severe CAP, in which more pathogenic organisms, such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli are identified (12) . Since these pathogens are more commonly identified in older adults, blood cultures should be part of the standard diagnostic evaluation of an older adult with CAP. The clinical indications for more extensive etiologic diagnostic testing are listed in Table 1 . Many diagnostic tests to determine the etiology of pneumonia require sputum production, and often older adults have difficulty producing sputum. Nevertheless, diagnostic testing is particularly important when results may alter antibiotic management decisions, when outbreaks must be identified (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], influenza, Legionnaire's disease, agents of bioterrorism), and when there are epidemiologic implications (e.g., emergence of resistant pathogens). The clinical utility of sputum culture results is largely dependent on the quality of the sputum specimen and whether the specimen was obtained prior to antimicrobial therapy. When sputum is difficult to obtain, urinary antigen tests for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 can assist in making a diagnosis. These tests have a higher diagnostic yield in patients with the most severe disease. Other advantages of these tests include rapidity of results, ability to detect antigen even after initiation of antibiotic therapy, and high specificity. For Legionella, all commercially available urinary antigen assays only detect serogroup 1. Although serogroup 1 accounts for 80-95% of community-acquired cases of Legionnaire's disease, other serogroups would not be detected by the standard urinary antigen assay (12) . For influenza A and B, adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus, a direct fluorescent antibody test can be performed rapidly on nasopharyngeal samples and can assist in determining whether antiviral or antimicrobial therapy is warranted. For patients with HAP that require mechanical ventilation, postintubation tracheal aspiration has been shown to be reliable for microbiologic diagnosis when compared with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), plugged telescoping catheter, and protected specimen brush procedures (14) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2664, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3197, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1341, "end": 1348, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Diagnostic Tests"}, {"text": "Particularly in older adults, prognostic scoring systems can help predict outcomes of therapy. Most scoring systems predict mortality; however, few assess other clinical outcomes such as physical functional ability, cognitive ability, need for nursing home care, and overall quality of life which are important outcomes for older adults (15) . The pneumonia severity index (PSI) derived and validated by Fine et al. is a two-step 20 variable scoring system that is best at identifying patients that can be treated as outpatients. However, many older adults fall into the high-risk groups purely based on their age; therefore, it is not as useful at predicting treatment outcomes in this group of patients (15) . Lim et al. derived and validated CURB65, a modified version of the scoring system of the British Thoracic Society. This system consists of five parameters: c onfusion, u remia, r espiratory rate, low b lood pressure, and age \u00b3 65 years (16) . CURB65 has been shown to be useful in the emergency department because of its simplicity of use and ability to identify low-risk patients (17) . Modifications to CURB65 to account for age \u00b3 85 years and higher blood urea levels further identify those of the older cohort with severe pneumonia (18) . In one scoring system derived and validated among seniors \u00b3 65 years of age, five features were independently predictive of hospital mortality: age > 85 years, impaired motor response, creatinine level of >1.5 mg/dL, presence of coexisting disease, and extremely abnormal vital signs (19) . In all of these scoring systems, age > 85 years has been shown to be the greatest predictor of mortality. Currently, no scoring systems exist that predict outcomes other than mortality in the care of older adults with pneumonia but several observational studies in nursing home populations document a decline in function after pneumonia. In a prospective study of nursing home residents with lower respiratory tract infection, the incidence in decline of functional status was 29%. Those that had a decline in functional status at 30 days after pneumonia episode were less likely to recover to their baseline status at 90 days (20) .

However, for patients with CURB-65 scores \u00b3 2, hospitalization or intensive in-home health care services are usually warranted. Patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors or with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation are usually directed to admission in the intensive care unit (12) . However, among older adults, assessing goals of care are often warranted before initiating hospital and/or intensive care unit (ICU admission). For patients with CAP, hospital-at-home services have been shown to be feasible, safe, efficacious, and more cost effective than hospital admission (21) . In addition, hospital-at-home has been associated with lower levels of family member stress and does not appear to shift the burden of care from hospital staff to family members (22) . ICU admission is not warranted in the older adult in whom comfort is the main goal of care. For nursing home residents with NHAP, a randomized controlled trial of a clinical pathway for treatment of NHAP in the nursing home versus hospitalization resulted in comparable clinical outcomes, while reducing hospitalizations and health care costs. In the clinical pathway group, 34 of 327 (10%) were hospitalized while 76 of 353 (22%) were hospitalized in the usual care group, resulting in greater than 50% proportional reduction in hospitalizations. The mortality rate was 8% (24 deaths) in the clinical pathway group versus 9% (32 deaths) in the usual care group. There were no significant differences in quality of life or functional status between the two groups. The overall cost savings by utilizing the clinical pathway per resident was $1,016 (95% CI, $207-$1,824) (23) .

If any one of these criteria was not met, the resident was transferred to the hospital (23) . Additionally, because this study was conducted in Canada, and since the United States has a different healthcare financing system, generalizing this clinical pathway to treat pneumonia in the nursing home may not be feasible in the United States.

Age \u00b3 65 years has been identified as a risk factor for b -lactam-resistant S. pneumoniae. Resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins appears to be decreasing but macrolide resistance continues to increase.

Since 90% of all influenza-related deaths occur among people aged at least 65 years, yearly influenza vaccination has been recommended; however, the actual benefits of influenza vaccination in older adults are controversial. Even as vaccination coverage increased from 15 to 65%, recent excess mortality studies did not demonstrate a decline in influenza-related mortality since 1980 (27) . Impaired antibody responses are thought to contribute to stable mortality rates. Booster influenza vaccines have been shown to augment antibody responses among nursing home residents with an impaired response to initial vaccination; however, improved seroprotection rates were not shown to decrease hospitalization rates, death, or antibiotic use in a year without circulating influenza (28) . One possible explanation for poor responsiveness to influenza vaccine is age-related impairment in innate immunity, specifically Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated expression of the B7 costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 which are critical for vaccine immunity (29) . Therefore, only yearly influenza vaccination is currently recommended, but future attempts at improved vaccine strategies are warranted. Since inadequate oral care and swallowing difficulty have been identified as independent modifiable risk factors for NHAP, interventions targeted towards improving oral hygiene and swallowing (e.g., mechanical oral care, 0.12% oral chlorhexidine rinsing) need to be tested to determine whether they can reduce the incidence of pneumonia. In a recent pilot evaluation in two nursing homes, it was demonstrated that mechanical oral care (i.e., teeth and/or denture and oral cavity brushing) plus 0.12% oral chlorhexidine rinses were feasible to perform by certified nurses aides, were adhered to by nursing staff, and were effective in improving oral hygiene (i.e., reduction in oral plaque scores) and swallowing difficulty (Vincent Quagliarello, 2009 ). Additional interventions to improve swallowing need to be investigated as well. The traditional Chinese herbal medicine Banxia Houpu Tang (BHT) found to improve swallowing reflex in patients with stroke and Parkinson's disease has been tested in a randomized controlled trial among elderly nursing home residents and was found to reduce the risk of pneumonia and pneumoniarelated mortality (30) . Likely, a combination of interventions to improve oral hygiene and swallowing difficulty will have the greatest potential of reducing the burden of pneumonia in nursing home residents.
