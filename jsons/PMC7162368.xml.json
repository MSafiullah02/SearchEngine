            "text": "Although a variety of mammalian cell hosts are available for protein production, only a small number have emerged as systems of choice for production of proteins to be used clinically. The most common of these cell hosts are summarized in Table 1. The narrowing down of choices is largely due to the need for cell lines that: (1) are capable of continuous growth; (2) can be grown in suspension (in bioreactors); (3) have low risk of adventitious infection by potentially pathogenic viruses; (4) have genetic stability; and (5) can be readily characterized with respect to karyology, morphology, isoenzymes, and gene copy number. The existence of a variety of host\u2010cell systems, the availability of viral or cDNA\u2010based vectors, and the possibility of either stable or transient expression requires that the prospective user define an expression strategy based on ultimate goals. When the researcher's objectives require <1 mg of protein, transient expression in COS\u20107 cells is the relevant route. Transient expression in the COS\u2010cell and vaccinia systems has been recently reviewed (Moss and Earl, 1991; Aruffo, 1997), and detailed protocols for construction of suitable vectors and protein expression by these systems can be found in those articles.",

Vectors are commercially available from a variety of vendors\u2014e.g., Invitrogen, Clontech, and Promega (see psaspl). A large variety of vectors are described in Pouwels et al. (1988). Suitable replicons contain 5 to 10 kb of DNA and usually are designed to contain phenotypic markers for selection in \nE. coli\n (e.g., Apr) and CHO cells (DHFR+). Other features of appropriate plasmids include a promoter\u2010distal cloning site along with other cloning sites; a replication origin for \nE. coli\n; a polyadenylation sequence from SV40 or bovine growth hormone; a eukaryotic origin of replication (e.g., SV40 or oriP); the gene for expression of the protein in a site proximal to the promoter; and a promoter and associated elements. Commonly used constitutive promoters for CHO cell applications are the SV40 early promoter (Moreau et al., 1981; Neuhaus et al., 1984), the adenovirus late promoter (McKnight and Tjian, 1986), and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter (Boshart et al., 1985). Transcriptional enhancers such as the human CMV enhancer (Boshart et al., 1985) can enhance transcriptional activity by 10\u2010 to 100\u2010fold and may be incorporated into the vector.

A number of CHO mutants have been developed that provide the user with tools to examine the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein as well as protein secretion, protein glycosylation, and intermediary metabolism. The most popular CHO sublines (also see Urlaub and Chasin, 1980) are CHO DXB11 (dhfr\n+/dhfr\n\u2212) and CHO DG44 (dhfr\n\u2212/dhfr\n\u2212). The DXB11 cell was derived from CHO\u2010K1 in 1978 by Lawrence Chasin. The CHO\u2010K1 cells were originally derived in the 1950s, and the cells that were used in Chasin's laboratory for the development of the DXB11 line were obtained from Ted Puck and Fa\u2010ten Kao at the Eleanor Roosevelt Cancer Institute in Denver in 1970. The DG44 cell line contains a double mutation in the dhfr genes and is not capable of natural reversion to the dhfr\n+ phenotype. The DG44 cell line was derived from CHO pro3\u2212 cells by Chasin in 1982. The CHO pro3\u2212 was derived from the cell line established in the 1950s and is sometimes referred to as CHO Toronto, because it was used extensively in that city by Louis Siminivitch and colleagues. Both these cell lines can be obtained from Dr. Lawrence Chasin of Columbia University (e\u2010mail: lac2@columbia.edu). Other mutants have been produced, and a brief list is included in Wirth and Hauser (1993).",

Retroviruses are capable of integrating genetic material into the chromosome of host cells\u2014i.e., stable transformation. As with viruses, the use of plasmid vectors can result in either stable or transient expression of a gene product; the plasmid vectors without a mammalian cell replicon would require stable integration for expression of gene product.",

            "text": "Stable production of foreign proteins by mammalian cells requires use of a host cell line that is capable of incorporating the heterologous\u2010gene DNA into a chromosome. In addition to the need for successful stable integration, a selection method is needed to fish out the stable transformants from the large population of cells that may contain unstable, intracellular heterologous gene copies. This necessitates cotransfection of a gene conferring some unique phenotypic property. Resistance to cytotoxic drugs is the most frequently applied method for selection of stable transformants. Normally, a gene for recessive drug resistance would be cotransfected into a host cell deficient in that particular activity. The most common approach is the use of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which can be used as a selectable marker in DHFR\u2010deficient CHO cells (Kaufman and Sharp, 1982). Other common transfectable selectable amplification markers that can be used with CHO cells are adenosine deaminase (in presence of inhibitors of ADA or cytotoxic levels of adenine or its analogs) in CHO DXB11 (DHFR\u2212; Yeung et al., 1983; Kaufman et al., 1986); carbamyl phosphate synthetase\u2013aspartate transcarbamylase\u2013dihydroorotase in CHO UrdA mutant cells (de Saint Vincent et al., 1981); asparagine synthetase in CHO N3 (AS\u2212) cells (Cartier and Stanners, 1990); glutamine synthetase in any CHO cell (Bebbington and Hentschel, 1987); ornithine decarboxylase in CHO C55.7 (ODC\u2212; Chiang and McConlogue, 1988); multiple drug resistance in any CHO cell (Kane et al., 1989); and a mutant DHFR (Leu 22 changed to Arg 22) which can be used in any CHO cell host (Simonsen and Levinson, 1983).

It is likely that integration occurs at random sites. Given that the mammalian\u2010cell genome is large (>109 bp), has 20% to 30% of the DNA as single\u2010copy, and has only 0.1% of the genomic DNA containing coding sequences, it is critical to exert selective pressure to screen out the large number of nonproductive clones. Further amplification in the presence of selective pressure is necessary to obtain clones in which multiple copies of the heterologous gene are obtained through coamplification with the dhfr or other selectable marker gene. In this respect it is wise to screen for high producers at moderate levels of methotrexate (<1 \u00b5M) to prevent enrichment of high\u2010copy\u2010number but unstable integrands. Stability is assessed through determination of productivity after extended growth or passaging in the absence of selective pressure in complete medium.",

A smaller portion of the cells will integrate the DNA chromosomally, resulting in stable protein expression. Following selection of these stable\u2010expressing cells by application of selective pressure, less than or equal to approximately 0.1% of the original population will express the foreign protein. It is thus imperative to use selective pressure in the production of the early stable\u2010expressing clones to prevent overgrowth with nonproducing cells. For CHO dhfr\n\u2212 host\u2013based production, the cells are grown in medium deficient in nucleosides (e.g., \u03b1\u2010MEM medium from Life Technologies), containing serum that has been dialyzed (to remove low\u2010molecular\u2010weight nucleosides such as hypoxanthine), and supplemented with 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5M methotrexate. In deficient medium, the cell's requirement for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides is satisfied by the action of heterologous dihydrofolate reductase, which converts folate from the medium to tetrahydrofolate (FH4). FH4 and serine are then used by cellular serine hydroxymethyl transferase to provide methylene\u2010FH4 which can go on to donate C1 units in the reactions required for inosinic acid and thymidine production. Cells that acquire the capacity to express DHFR can be selected by medium deficient in nucleosides. Stepwise increases in the methotrexate concentration with increased passaging in deficient medium will select for cells containing high copy number of DHFR (Kaufman, 1990).",

The protein can contain sequences (motifs) that will order specific post\u2010translational modifications as the protein progresses through the ER into the Golgi and before reaching the final destination either as a secreted protein or as a specialized resident cellular protein (see Table 2). In general, initiation of gene\u2010transcription is the rate\u2010limiting step. The rate of transcription elongation is constant until the movement of RNA polymerase II is stopped by termination signals.

A signal\u2010recognition particle (SRP) binds to the signal sequence of the growing peptide when it protrudes into the cytoplasm, thereby halting further synthesis of the protein until the ribosome\u2010SRP complex has bound to the docking protein (SRP receptor) at the ER membrane. Protein synthesis then continues and the peptide chain progresses into the lumen of the ER. At this point the amino\u2010terminal signal sequence is cleaved off. Signal peptides encompass 13 to 30 amino acids. They usually have a net positive charge at the N terminus, a core of nine or more hydrophobic amino acids, and a cleavage site (Von Heijne, 1983, 1984). The tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader peptide has been used for efficient translocation (Burke et al., 1986). The protein is folded and glycosylation is initiated in the ER. Detailed discussion of the intracellular factors involved in protein translocation are given in a number of excellent reviews (Gething and Sambrook, 1992; Rothman and Orci, 1992; Wirth and Hauser, 1993; Rothman, 1994).",

The ER provides an environment optimized for protein folding and is distinguished by a relatively high concentration of calcium (Baumann et al., 1991). The folding and stability of some proteins is calcium\u2010dependent (Lodish and Kong, 1990). Another significant feature of the ER is that its redox potential is sufficiently high to enable disulfide\u2010bond formation (Hwang et al., 1992). It appears that glutathione is the redox buffer and that the redox potential of the ER is 20 to 100 times more oxidizing than that of the cytosol as indicated by the GSH/GSSG ratios (between 1:1 and 1:3 in the ER as compared to between 30:1 and 100:1 in the cytosol; Hwang et al., 1992). The ER contains soluble folding enzymes such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and prolyl isomerase, which serve to aid the refolding process. Another group of proteins known as chaperones (Ellis and Hemmingsen, 1989) are present in the ER and appear to assist in protein folding and to ensure that incorrectly folded protein is not released from the ER, thus playing a quality\u2010assurance role for newly synthesized protein in the cell. The best\u2010studied chaperone is the glucose response protein BiP (or GRP 78), a member of the hsp70 family of proteins (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Hendershot et al., 1988). An ER integral membrane protein called calnexin (Bergeron et al., 1994) also appears to function in quality control of protein folding in the ER and affects the retention of incorrectly folded protein. Calnexin is unrelated to the heat\u2010shock chaperone Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 families.",

Intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed with the assistance of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and the molecular chaperone BiP/GRP78 associates with the refolding peptide chain. Multiple cycles of BiP binding and release occur in a process that requires ATP. Protein folding occurs with high efficiency and with a half\u2010time on the order of 1 min. Pulse\u2010chase studies of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBVsAg) secretion in mouse fibroblast cells (Huovila et al., 1992) showed that the formation of HBVsAg dimers in the ER occurred rapidly, within 2 min, while formation of higher\u2010order oligomers occurred with a half\u2010time of 2 hr. The study also provided evidence that the rate\u2010limiting step was likely to be passage from the ER into the Golgi, as mature intracellular glycosylated HBV was not detected. The higher\u2010order assembly of subunits or assembly of multimeric proteins begins in the ER and is likely completed in the so\u2010called 15\u00b0 compartment (named because of accumulation of molecules there at low temperature). This appeared to be the case for HBVsAg (Huovila et al., 1992). When a monomeric subunit is extensively folded, the BiP dissociates, and for multimeric proteins such as viral membrane proteins, subunit\u2010subunit recognition and assembly occurs prior to transport into the Golgi complex (Doms et al., 1993). Only correctly folded protein progresses from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Protein may be misfolded as a result of inefficient folding, mutations, heat shock, energy depletion, or addition of exogenous reductants such as dithiothreitol. These misfolded proteins usually form aggregates and typically display permanent and stable association with BiP. Aggregates are eventually degraded unless they are salvaged through a pathway that facilitates refolding from the misfolded protein species under specific conditions\u2014e.g., altered temperature for temperature\u2010sensitive folding mutants or where the ER environment is experimentally altered.",

The cis Golgi stack (CGN) and trans Golgi stack (TGN) are defined areas of the entire Golgi network. The CGN and TGN constitute the entry and exit faces, respectively, and are involved in sorting and distribution of the protein. The CGN includes the KDEL salvage pathway for ER\u2010based proteins. The TGN is where proteins with differing final destinations\u2014e.g., lysosomes, secretory vesicles, and plasma membrane\u2014diverge. The Golgi consists of stacks of cisternae where carbohydrate\u2010chain trimming and elongation as well as other covalent modifications occur. The mechanism of flow through the Golgi cisternae appears to involve assembly of coated vesicles, which then transfer to the next compartment with concomitant loss of the coat. The loss of coat is linked to GTP\u2010dependent hydrolysis, while subsequent fusion at the destination cisternae is ATP\u2010dependent and also involves an N\u2010ethylmaleimide (NEM)\u2010sensitive enzyme, Sec18p. The specificity of vesicle targeting involves a docking mechanism based on binding of soluble NEM\u2010sensitive attachment protein (SNAP) to a receptor designated as SNARE.

This complexity stems from the need to satisfy the many functions required for normal growth and metabolism of mammalian cells (Bettger and McKeehan, 1986). Nutrients must satisfy the requirements for growth, maintenance of the cell, and expression of products. Additional specific growth factors such as insulin or insulin\u2010like growth factor (IGF) are usually required. Minimal nutritional requirements were first defined in the 1950s (Eagle, 1955). These early studies showed that thirteen amino acids (Arg, Cys, Gln, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val), eight vitamins (biotin, folic acid, niacinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamine), and various salts and minerals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, PO4, Fe, Zn, Se, and possibly Cu, Mn, Mo, and V, which are usually present as trace contaminants) are required. The commonly used CHO derivatives DXB11 and DG44 have an absolute requirement for proline that results from a genetic deficiency in the conversion of glutamic acid to glutamic \u03b3\u2010semialdehyde. Inorganic ions may function as catalysts or exert physiological effects. Glucose (5 to 20 mM) and glutamine (0.5 to 5 mM) are commonly used to provide the energy source for the cells. These are consumed at a rate proportional to the viable\u2010cell concentration. Cultured mammalian cells do not use the complete tricarboxcylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the glucose\u2010consumption rate is lower than the glutamine consumption rate. Consumption of glucose yields lactate and consumption of glutamine yields ammonia as the metabolic byproduct. Other nutrients are consumed at a rate proportional to the rate of increase in cell density. Yield\u2010based uptake rates for amino acids by CHO DG 44 cells range from 0.1 mM tryptophan/109 cells to 0.8 mM arginine/109cells at a specific growth rate (the rate of growth divided by the cell density) of 0.25 to 0.30 days\u22121 (D. Gray, unpub. observ.), reflecting the relative incorporation frequency of the individual amino acids into general protein. CHO cells, like most mammalian cells, produce alanine as a result of glutaminolysis. Accumulation of ammonia, as a result of glutamine degradation in the medium and consumption by cells, may become inhibitory to cell growth and ultimately limit the density of the culture (Butler and Spier, 1984).",

In the same study, the specific rate of \u03b3 interferon (\u03b3\u2010IFN) production increased with the specific growth rate (\u00b5), indicating growth\u2010related product production. The pattern of \u03b3\u2010IFN glycosylation was similar at all growth rates except the lowest, where an increase in nonglycosylated \u03b3\u2010IFN was observed. This was further addressed using batch culture (Leelavatcharamas et al., 1994), where it was concluded that the growth\u2010associated production was a reflection of a cell cycle\u2013related phenomenon whereby lower growth rate resulted in a prolongation of the cell\u2010cycle time with an increase in the relative frequency of the G1 cells in the culture population.

Cytoplasmic translation results in a nascent polypeptide that is chaperoned by the hsp70 protein, which may direct the ribosome\u2010peptide complex to the mitochondrion or the ER upon N\u2010terminal peptide signaling. A signal\u2010recognition particle (SRP) binds to the signal sequence, halting translation until it has docked at the SRP receptor. The hsp70 protein maintains the protein in a translocation\u2010competent state, enabling membrane protrusion. Inside the ER the protein undergoes refolding assisted by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), BiP, and calnexin (CXN). Initial N\u2010glycosylation takes place cotranslationally in the ER. Misfolded protein, associated with BiP, is retained and eventually degraded. Transport of folded, assembled protein between the ER and Golgi cisternae occurs through a series consisting of budding, vesicle formation, and specific binding to target cisternae surfaces, through to the trans Golgi (TGN), where distribution to particular destinations occurs.
