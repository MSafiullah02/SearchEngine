This compression was likely related to viscous hyperbending attitude of the head for a prolonged period. In addition, the MRI hypersignal of paravertebral muscles observed with regard to the spinal lesion strongly supported this diagnosis. Association with stress cardiomyopathy is uncommon although significant dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system has been described as a consequence of the loss of supraspinal control of the sympathetic nervous system [1] . Acute non-traumatic cervical spinal cord injury is traditionally reported among patients with prolonged hyperextension of the back (surfers myelopathy) and is associated with poor neurological recovery [2] .
