Bloodborne viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus) are the most widely studied with regard to transmission in healthcare settings, and although epidemiological studies indicate accidents as the primary cause of exposure, there is a hypothetical although not proven possibility of viral transmission via droplets and surfaces.1, 2\n",

This has been well documented with regard to water contamination, although, so far, data on healthcare settings remain few.7 Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess viral contamination on hospital surfaces and in the air using biomolecular tests by contemporaneously testing for the presence of different viral agents. The viruses chosen are considered representative of nosocomial infections commonly transmitted through various routes: hepatitis C virus for the bloodborne route; norovirus and human rotavirus for faecal\u2013oral transmission; and human adenovirus for the respiratory route. Apart from these agents of nosocomial infections, we also considered the torque teno virus (TTV), which, although not clearly associated with any specific disease, is widespread among the healthy population, irrespective of age, sex and any risk factors, reaching a prevalence of 100%.8 Since TTV DNA has been found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, liver, faeces, urine, saliva, cord blood, amniotic fluid, breast milk, semen, cervical secretions and sewage, it may be regarded as a possible indicator of general viral contamination.9 Along with viral detection tests, surfaces and aerosols were also monitored for viable bacterial count (VBC). Although this parameter is not strictly associated with contamination, it is generally used to assess hygienic conditions in healthcare settings and the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection procedures.10 For this reason, it was chosen as a comparison with the data on viral presence. Other specific bacteria were also sought, but were found to be wholly absent from surfaces. In addition, their presence and mean counts in air were so variable that no hypotheses could be made over any association with viruses. Finally, haemoglobin (Hb) determinations were also made. These are commonly used in forensic settings to reveal bloodborne contamination of surfaces, but have also been applied to healthcare settings.11\n",

Furthermore, the detected strains belonged to the genogroups most widespread in the general population.23 This study is the first in which TTV has been sought and detected in a hospital setting, hence no comparisons with other studies are possible. The finding of different ratios of positive samples in different hospital units indicates that some areas may be more prone to viral contamination than others. The highest rates of positive results for surfaces were found in the sterilisation centre and bronchoscopy unit, and in the haematology units for air samples.",

Accordingly, such an interpretation seems compatible with the present findings. Since TTV is non-cultivable, environmental longevity has been assessed only through DNA persistence. On surfaces where effective disinfection procedures have been applied (as confirmed by a very low bacterial load), detected TTV could have been inactivated, and its presence indicative only of previous contamination. Moreover, although the antibacterial action of the disinfectant used (1000\u20135000 ppm of chlorine) has been clearly established as per guidelines for hospital surfaces (5 log10 reduction), no such data are available for its effect on viruses. This is the case for virion inactivation and degradation of nucleic acids, so that any possible effects on PCR reaction are unknown.24 In the air, which is not routinely disinfected (as indicated by the mean bacterial counts), TTV could presumably remain viable and possibly lead to airborne transmission. Where the air is filtered, as in sterile rooms, the presence of TTV DNA could indicate that air filters fail to retain the virus. However, the actual significance of its presence cannot be clearly understood without an evaluation of virus viability. Some experimental data (not shown) on TTV DNA persistence on artificially contaminated surfaces following different disinfection procedures have shown that after 2 h treatment with 2.9 ppm chlorine, 64.6% of the initial genome copies were still present. Virus infectivity remained indeterminable because TTV cannot be cultured. The same test, conducted in parallel with HAdV (culturable) revealed the persistence of 23.7% of genome copies and 5.8% viable virus. These data suggest the possible survival of infective TTV on surfaces, though to a lesser extent than suggested by its nucleic acid stability.",
