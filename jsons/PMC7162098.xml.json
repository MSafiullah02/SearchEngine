The pre\u2010existing level of specific viral antibody can modulate the severity of symptoms and viral shedding after experimental infection but cannot account for all the variability observed [4]. Prospective epidemiologic surveys have implicated an association between expression of allergy, documented by elevated levels of serum IgE and positive allergy skin tests with the development of asthma in infants and children who manifested a viral illnesses that provoked wheezing and rhinitis [5]. In addition, clinical observations and anecdotal experiences have indicated that patients with allergic rhinitis experience more pronounced symptoms during a viral URI than those individuals similarly infected with a respiratory virus who do not have allergic rhinitis [6].",

Avilla and coworkers proposed that inducing allergic inflammation just before RV inoculation would amplify the local response to infection in allergic subjects. Prior to inoculation with RV16, one group of 10 allergics had three intranasal challenges with allergens and another group of 10 allergics received three placebo challenges in the week before experimental intranasal infection with RV16. The two groups had equal rates (90%) of infection and similar cold symptoms but the inoculation period was longer in the allergen\u2010challenged group and the duration of cold symptoms was shorter. There were no changes in lung spirometry or methachlorine provocative tests in either group during or after RV16 infection. Thus, this study showed that priming the nasal mucosa with repeated allergens challenged before RV16 experimental intranasal infection did not worsen the severity of cold symptoms but delayed their onset and shortened the duration. This study also showed that there was a delayed appearance and increase in nasal cytokine secretion of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 that paralleled the delayed appearance of cold symptoms and corroborates the concept that it is the host response and not the virus that causes cold symptoms [13].",

            "text": "Lemanski and coworkers studied the effect of experimental RV16 infection on lower airway pathophysiology in 10 patients with allergic rhinitis [14]. There was a moderate increase in airway responsiveness to histamine at 48 h with the onset of the acute viral respiratory infection. In addition, RV39 infection increased the immediate response to allergen challenge as shown by a decrease in the concentration of allergens required to decrease the FEV1 by 20% (Fig. 2). Before virus inoculation only one subject had a late phase asthmatic reaction as indicated by a decrease in FEV1 of greater than 15% at 4\u20136 h postallergen challenge. However, in these same subjects after viral injection eight of the 10 subjects developed a late\u2010phase reaction after allergen challenge. The same laboratory confirmed these observations in an additional eight subjects and also showed an enhanced increase in plasma histamine levels after allergen challenge [15]. These investigators hypothesized that RV infections promoted the development of the allergic reaction by increasing those hose responses that produced the early\u2010 and late\u2010phase allergic reaction to allergens. Using segmental pulmonary allergen challenge in normal and allergic rhinitis patients who were infected with RVI6, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis before and after RV16 experimental infection showed an increase in BAL histamine, leucocytes and eosinophils [16]. The increased secretion of histamine persisted 4\u20136 weeks after the RV infection. Additional studies comparing patients with and without allergic rhinitis demonstrated that the lower airway response to histamine broncho\u2010provocation was significantly different in allergic rhinitis subjects [17]. As shown in Fig. 3, there was also a positive correlation between the initial FEV1 and the response to histamine provocation, indicating that the RV16 infection tended to increase the response to histamine provocation in those allergic rhinitis subjects with lower baseline FEV1. Fraenkel and colleagues experimentally infected allergics and normals and showed that RV16 increased histamine responsiveness in those with allergic asthma, but the changes were moderate [18]. Similar observations were seen in another study by the same group with airway hyperresponsiveness selectively enhanced in the allergic subjects but not in the nonallergic subjects [19]. However, not all studies using experimental RV infection have shown consistent effects in airway hyperresponsiveness. Skoner and coworkers in our laboratories studied methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness in 31 subjects with allergic rhinitis and 27 normal controls experimentally infected with RV39 and found no effect of RV infection on the bronchial response to methacholine. Additional studies by Skoner et al. showed no effect of an attenuated influenza virus on lower airway function or bronchial responses to methacholine in either allergics or nonallergics [20]. Halperin and colleagues experimentally infected 19 asthmatic subjects with RV39 and Rhinovirus Hanks and found changes in airway hyper\u2010responsiveness to histamine in only four of the 19 subjects [21]. These four subjects who developed histamine hyperresponsiveness during RV infection also had some decrease in FEV1, which might have some clinical significance. In another study this time using experimental RV2 infection Summers and colleagues found no changes in airway hyperresponsiveness to either histamine or bradykinin regardless of their allergic status [22]. Additional studies by Fleming et al. of RV16 experimental infection in healthy and asthmatic subjects also showed the severity of cold symptoms and the relative changes in pulmonary function to be similar in both groups, with only small increases in asthmatic symptoms and no increase in the use of bronchodilators [23].",

            "text": "Viral respiratory infections have major impacts on upper respiratory function as well as lower respiratory function in patients of all ages. These viral illnesses, which are often mild and only an inconvenience to many normal individuals, can also influence the subsequent development of allergy and asthma exacerbations with a major influence on these patient's well\u2010being and their health status. Lower airway infection with respiratory syncytial virus increases the risk of asthma during the first decade of life, especially in those infants who have a genetic allergic predisposition. Yet, overall, the respiratory infection burden, the so\u2010called \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019, as a whole is probably protective against the development of asthma. However, once asthma has developed, respiratory viruses precipitate many of the asthma exacerbations seen in both children and adults. Rhinovirus is the most common viral cause of upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract infections in older children and adults. Because allergy increases the risk of wheezing during a viral respiratory tract infection, our group of investigators as well as other investigators have focused on the interactions between allergic inflammation and experimental viral infection to understand the pathogenesis of these allergic and asthmatic exacerbations. In this review article I have discussed studies of experimental RV infection in both allergic and nonallergic humans. Allergen challenge during an experimental RV infection enhances the allergic and asthmatic inflammatory responses as reported by Lemanski and coworkers, who showed that the combination of allergen and RV in allergic subjects will enhance lower airway \u2018asthmatic\u2010like\u2019 pathophysiology [14]. Skoner et al. showed that allergic IgE responses were potentiated by experimental RV infection in subjects with allergic rhinitis even though significant increases of nasal symptoms were not seen [8]. In spite of these observations, experimental RV infections in allergic and nonallergic subjects causes far less of both upper and lower airway disease than clinicians would have anticipated based on the frequency that RV causes significant asthmatic exacerbations. Although the precise mechanism by which respiratory viruses such as RV cause symptoms is not known, there is evidence that the host immune response to the virus but not the virus itself plays a major role in symptoms pathogenesis. Viral replication in the epithelium of the airway triggers intracellular signalling pathways leading to increases in the local secretion of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. It appears that there may be increases in various cytokines during viral infection that can potentially recruit and activate those aspects of inflammation that are linked to the expression of allergy or asthma. It is anticipated that future studies in these aspects of viral and allergic inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis and asthma.",
