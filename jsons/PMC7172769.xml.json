            "text": "Parasites, defined as organisms that live at the expense of their hosts (Combes, 2001; Poulin and Forbes, 2012), form diverse and ubiquitous components of all ecosystems, and include both macroparasites (e.g. helminths, arthropods) and microparasites (e.g. bacteria, viruses, fungi, protists). While most ecological studies focus on megafauna, these organisms can exert a significant influence on ecosystem composition and function via their diversity, abundance and impact on other members of the community (Thomas et al., 2005). While much is known regarding parasites in some taxa (i.e. captive mammals), considerably less is known in others. Given that changing climatic conditions are expected to influence parasite distribution and abundance, understanding current levels of infection, transmission pathways and population-level impacts are integral aspects for predicting ecosystem changes (e.g. L\u00e9ger et al., 2013). Seabirds are a particularly interesting group to study in this respect as they often traverse large distances along their migratory routes, and thus may be exposed to, and disperse, many more parasites when compared to other groups (Boulinier et al., 2016). Additionally, seabirds are long-lived and typically breed in large, dense colonies, traits that can favour parasite maintenance within populations (McCoy et al., 2016). Finally, some species of seabirds frequently come into contact with humans (e.g. gulls or harvested species), and thus may be a source of zoonotic disease.",

Recent research has provided an overview of some of these relationships (e.g. Granroth-Wilding et al., 2014; Provencher et al., 2017), whereas others, such as Grimaldi et al. (2011), focused on the impact of parasites in specific bioregions and orders/genera. Except under extreme conditions where the presence of a parasite has a devastating impact causing widespread mortality (e.g. avian cholera; Butler et al., 2011; Descamps et al., 2012; Friend and Franson, 1999), little is known about how interactions with these organisms alter seabird health, reproductive success, and ultimately, seabird population viability and evolution. The impact of a parasite will depend on the nature of the parasite in question, and may be influenced by interactions with other local environmental factors, such as the quantity and quality of food resources, levels of local pollution, habitat quality, and presence of predators, competitors and/or other parasites (e.g. Butler et al., 2011; Provencher et al., 2016).",

For example, Polar Regions are expected to warm at a more rapid rate than temperate or tropical regions (Francis and Vavrus, 2015). Generally, parasitism is thought to be relatively depauperate in polar regions because of the lower diversities of suitable intermediate hosts, coupled with conditions that may be unsuitable for certain parasite groups (Brooks et al., 2014; Davidson et al., 2011; Kutz et al., 2014). However, with changing climatic conditions, and corresponding distributional changes in different taxonomic groups, parasite diversity in the polar zones may increase substantially. There is already evidence to suggest increased parasitism in northern wildlife due to changing climatic conditions (Brooks and Hoberg, 2007, Kutz et al., 2009, Kutz et al., 2014). Additionally, novel parasites may extend their ranges in polar regions, or potentially expand to new hosts introducing new interactions within ecosystems (Davidson et al., 2011; Galaktionov, 2017).",

All species require at least one bloodmeal to complete the life cycle, feeding on a wide range of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. Among arthropods, ticks transmit the greatest variety of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and even helminths, but most research to date on seabirds has focused on Ixodes spp., which act as vectors of Lyme disease bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.; Dantas-Torres et al., 2012; Jongejan and Uilenberg, 2004; Table 1). Ticks can be divided into two distinct categories; hard ticks (Ixodidae) and soft ticks (Argasidae). Hard ticks have a single long bloodmeal in each of their three life stage (larva, nymph, adult), whereas soft ticks take several short bloodmeals in nymphal and adult stages and have a variable number of nymphal instars (Dietrich et al., 2011). In both groups, the duration of attachment on the host determines the likelihood of disease transmission (Dantas-Torres et al., 2012).",

Of these, Ixodes uriae has the largest distribution, and is the most studied species (Fig. 1\n; Coulson et al., 2009a, Coulson et al., 2009b; McCoy et al., 2003; Mu\u00f1oz-Leal and Gonz\u00e1lez-Acu\u00f1a, 2015; Ols\u00e9n et al., 1993). Hard ticks have been recorded feeding on seabirds belonging to the orders Charadriiformes, Phaethontiformes, Sphenisciformes, Procellariiformes, and Suliformes (Dietrich et al., 2011; Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2003; Ramos et al., 2005). However, no observations of hard ticks on wild individuals from Pelicaniformes, Gaviiformes, or Anseriformes have been reported to date. The taxonomic status of most seabird hard ticks is well-established, though work has shown that these ticks may form isolated host specific populations, even when different seabird species breed in sympatry (e.g. McCoy et al., 2003); the potential for host-associated speciation may be high in this group and overall diversity as measured using traditional morphological criteria may underestimate true diversity (Moon et al., 2015).",

However, due to the short time that these ticks require for blood-feeding (i.e. minutes) and their nocturnal activity, they are difficult to observe under natural conditions and their diversity, prevalence and local abundance in seabird colonies is surely underestimated. In addition, general questions related to their systematics remain open (Dupraz et al., 2016; Guglielmone et al., 2010), and much basic observational work is still required to clarify their diversity, specificity and impact on seabird population dynamics.",

However, post-mortem investigations of three dead King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) found on the Crozet archipelago in the Sub-Antarctic region led researchers to conclude that hyperinfestation by ticks during incubation (when birds do not feed) was the most likely cause of death (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 1998). Although no difference in body mass or behaviour of breeding King Penguins was found with respect to more commonly observed levels of tick infestation (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2003), some impact on reproductive success has been suggested (Mangin et al., 2003). No such observations have been made for smaller penguin species.",

As the number of ticks in a given colony increases, the likelihood of nest desertion and chick mortality increases (Boulinier and Danchin, 1996; Duffy, 1983; Monticelli et al., 2008; Ramos et al., 2001; Ramos and Drummond, 2017). Conversely, breeding failures at the colony level also may also have a detrimental impact on local tick populations (Danchin, 1992; Dietrich et al., 2011; Monticelli et al., 2008; Ols\u00e9n et al., 1993; Ramos et al., 2001). This type of dynamic interaction between seabirds and ticks will also have consequences for the local transmission and large-scale circulation of infectious agents (Boulinier et al., 2001).",

Hyperinfestation can also result in severe itching, causing birds to pull feathers (Proctor, 2003).

Mites are typically transmitted between hosts by close body contact, which can be frequent in colonial nesting seabirds (Proctor, 2003). Feather mites have been found on species belonging to the order Procellariformes, Gaviiformes, Pelecaniformes, Anseriformes, and Charadriiformes (Proctor, 2003; Stefan et al., 2015). A study by Stefan et al. (2015) determined that a single bird can play host to multiple species of mites (Microspalax brevipes and Zachvatkinia ovate) due to resource partitioning and spatial segregation among the species. Indeed, a more recent study found up to eight different mite species exploiting Cape Verde Shearwaters (Calonectris edwardsii) and Bulwer's Petrels (Bulweria bulwerii; Stefan et al., 2018). However, the effects of mites on wild seabirds are largely unknown. Studies on mite-seabird interactions have focused on the phylogeny and co-evolution of mites and their hosts, rather than the impact of mite infestation itself (Choe and Kim, 1987; Coulson et al., 2009a, Coulson et al., 2009b; Stefan et al., 2018).",

Of the 2500 identified species, only those belonging to the genera Ceratophyllus, Parapsyllus, Mioctenopsylla, and Xenopsylla have been reported on seabirds (Coulson et al., 2009a, Coulson et al., 2009b; Kane et al., 2012). Flea parasitism probably occurs in most seabird species and has been reported in wild seabirds belonging to the orders Sphenisciformes, Charadriiformes, Anseriformes, Procellariformes, and Suliformes (Alonso and Garrido, 2009; Choe and Kim, 1987; Kristj\u00e1nsson et al., 2016). The egg, larval, and pupal stages of most fleas live off the host's body, but adults are obligate blood-feeders. Because a large part of the life cycle occurs in the habitat used by the host, the presence and abundance of fleas is closely related to the conditions of their breeding environment (G\u00f3mez-D\u00edaz and Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds, 2010). Fleas can act as disease vectors for several bacteria, viruses and helminths (Bitam et al., 2010; Kane et al., 2012). Although poorly studied in relation to seabirds, they are known mechanical vectors for avipoxviruses (discussed in a later section) (Kane et al., 2012).",

G\u00f3mez-D\u00edaz and Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds (2010) analysed host-parasite relationships by reporting on nitrogen and carbon enrichment in fleas from host species; however, the effects of parasitism on birds themselves were not discussed. A direct effect of fleas on seabirds was reported in a recent study by Kristj\u00e1nsson et al. (2016), examining the presence of the flea Ceratophyllus garei in Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) colonies. The authors noted a positive relationship between the age of nest bowls, and the number of fleas found within them. Hyper-parasitism by fleas led to irritation in adults, which resulted in agitated egg incubation. Blood cover on eggs was also positively correlated to flea infestation (Kristj\u00e1nsson et al., 2016) suggesting a potential cost in terms of blood loss. These results fall in line with observations in passerine birds (e.g. Fitze et al., 2004).",

Lice are further subdivided into two main groups: sucking lice (suborder Anoplura) and chewing lice (suborders Ischnocera, Amblycera and Rhynchophthirina). Anoplura are obligate blood-sucking parasites found almost exclusively on mammalian hosts. In contrast, species of chewing lice are commonly found on bird species, feeding on hair, feathers and epidermal skin/scales (Clay and Moreby, 1967). Unlike ticks and fleas, lice spend their entire life cycle on a single host. Females lay their eggs, commonly known as nits, by gluing them to the hairs or feathers of their hosts through a secretion created in their accessory glands. Lice are typically host-specific, rather than geographically-specific, which makes estimating their global distribution challenging (Clay and Moreby, 1967). Factors influencing the presence and abundance of lice on seabirds are not extensively studied. Rivera-Parra et al. (2014) sampled five seabird species across seven islands in the Galapagos, and found a connection between host density and louse infestation levels. However, the study also pointed out the need for further research on the impact of local weather conditions and host density on lice loads; factors which have been found to affect louse loads in other bird groups (Clayton et al., 2015).",

The Hippoboscidae are divided into three main subfamilies, only two of which (Ornithomyinae and Hippoboscinae) include obligate parasites of birds (Duvallet and Baldacchino, 2017). As hippoboscid flies are highly mobile (some species are winged) and can spend part of their lifecycle off host, host to host transmission can be very high (Bequaert, 1953). Factors affecting the parasitism by Hippoboscidae in seabirds are not well understood, and many species may have co-evolved with their specific hosts (Baker, 1967; Levin and Parker, 2013). However, humidity and oily plumage can be related to the prevalence of louse flies on seabirds (Bequaert, 1953). The annual colonial nesting behaviour of seabirds may also be a key aspect supporting the maintenance and spread of hippoboscid flies (Bastien et al., 2014; Levin and Parker, 2013).",

Olfersia aenescens most commonly parasitizes Charadriiformes, Procellariformes, and Pelecaniformes. However, information on hippoboscid flies in other avian orders is less clear. For example, no reports were found of hippoboscids on any members of Anseriformes in this review; this is thought to be due to their oily plumage and damp nesting habitat preferences (Bequaert, 1953). Within avian orders, the diversity of hippoboscids can vary greatly from family to family. Among Pelicaniformes, all members of the family Fregatidae share the species Olfersia spinifera, whereas O. aenescens, O. fossulata and O. sordida parasitize Phalacrocoricidae, Sulicidae and Pelicanidae (Bequaert, 1953).",

Like other macroparasites, the direct impact of mosquitoes on their hosts will depend on their relative abundance. Although factors affecting mosquito abundance are largely unknown, heat, humidity, and the availability of stagnant water for breeding are key determining factors (Wegbreit and Reisen, 2000).

The life cycle and transmission pathways of helminths are often complex, with both direct transmission (i.e. from parent to chick during feeding), and indirect transmission via intermediate hosts or vectors. Helminths are typically studied in seabirds through carcass collection (e.g. Mallory et al., 2007), although some studies have used regurgitation, endoscopic techniques, and anti-helminth treatments in seabirds, to assess parasitism in the gastro-intestinal tract and their effects (Fonteneau and Cook, 2013; Granroth-Wilding et al., 2017; Provencher et al., 2017). Information on the impact of helminths on some species are more available because they are hunted or often beach cast, but overall the need for carcasses poses a challenge to explore helminth-seabird relationships in wild populations, as lethal sampling is most often used. In situations where carcasses are available, a range of helminths have been found in host species (e.g. Mallory et al., 2007; Tourangeau et al., 2018).",

(2007) found a higher frequency of occurrence of cestodes in Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) during the post-breeding season as compared with the pre-breeding season. The diversity of cestodes and trematodes has been shown to vary across a host species range. For example, birds inhabiting the southern extent of the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) range in the North Sea have as many as 15 trematode species, whereas at the northern extent of the range in Franz Josef Land, only a single trematode species has been reported (Galaktionov, 1996, Galaktionov, 2017). In terms of the impact of these worms on seabird health and condition, as for most macroparasites, it is expected that negative impacts may only occur at very high parasite loads (see Galaktionov, 1996), but detailed studies in seabirds are limited and difficult to attribute to cestodes and trematodes in particular.",

Nematodes also have distinct male and female organisms (Galaktionov, 2017), similar to cestodes and trematodes, however, the prevalence of nematodes in seabirds is highly variable. Even individuals nesting at nearby colonies can exhibit strong differences in parasitism levels. Fonteneau and Cook (2013) found that Kerguelen Shags (Phalacrocorax verrucosus) nesting approximately 25 km from each other had significantly different prevalence and infection loads of the nematode Contracaecum rudolphii. The authors attributed this result to differences in diet between the two colonies, highlighting how local diet can be a significant factor for parasitism in seabirds. Sex bias was also identified by Robinson et al. (2008) in Double-crested Cormorants in Canada, where males had significantly higher levels of the nematode Contracaecum spp. when compared with females. Experimental removals of gastrointestinal nematode parasites was found to alter resource allocation in European Shags in relation to local breeding conditions (Granroth-Wilding et al., 2014, Granroth-Wilding et al., 2015, Reed et al., 2003), highlighting the importance of the interaction between parasites and local environmental factors in determining parasite impacts (Granroth-Wilding et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Much like cestodes and trematodes, acanthocephalans are parasitic worms that lack a mouth, and instead attach to their hosts using a proboscis that is covered with spiny hooks (Galaktionov, 2017; Hoberg, 1986). Acanthocephalans also have distinct male and female sexes, and their life cycle requires intermediate hosts, most commonly thought to be benthic crustaceans (Galaktionov, 2017). Although acanthocephalans have been identified in many Antarctic and Arctic seabird fauna (Charadriiformes, Sphenisciformes, Anseriformes; Brand\u00e3o et al., 2014; Hoberg, 1986), they are best studied as one of the most prolific parasites of Common Eiders in the northern hemisphere (Galaktionov, 1996; Provencher et al., 2016, Provencher et al., 2019; Fig. 3\n). A sex bias in the prevalence of acanthocephalans in seabird species has been identified, and may be attributable to differing life history strategies between males and females, especially during the breeding season, caring of young and feeding in distinct areas during the moulting season (Skirnisson, 2015). Similar to the other parasitic worms, the distribution and number of species in acanthocephalans vary by region, with the number of species of acanthocephalans being higher in the sub-Arctic regions than in Arctic environments (Galaktionov, 1996). Again, there is very little work done on how this particular group may negatively affect seabirds given the co-occurrence with other species, and the difficulty of examining this group in isolation in relation to potential impacts on species.",

Northern Fulmars from the high Canadian Arctic harboured several helminth species including cestodes, trematodes, nematodes, and acanthocephalans in varying levels of infection (Mallory et al., 2007). Tourangeau et al. (2018) similarly found that Common Eiders in northern Canada to have several cestodes and acanthocephalans with varying levels of infection in relation to age and sex. Due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable estimates of parasite diversity and loads, the impact of these species on seabird health and population dynamics have received relatively little attention.",

Avian pox is a slow-developing disease, the effects of which vary by species. The most common form of avian pox affects the skin, where the development of warts around featherless regions of birds (face, legs, and feet) is a common occurrence (Tripathy, 1993). These lesions often disappear with time but can leave behind scarred and damaged skin. However, in cases where these warts become enlarged and clustered, loss of sight, breathing impairment, and difficulty feeding are common side effects. It is in the case of secondary infections due to a dampened immune system, and the development of scar tissue, where avian pox can contribute to bird mortality (Friend and Franson, 1999; Kane et al., 2012).",

This is a key factor to note in the spread of avipoxviruses among seabird populations, many of which form dense breeding colonies. Avian pox has been reported in Sphenisciformes, Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, and Procellariiformes. A study of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from two colonies in Argentina revealed 108 chicks with avian pox lesions; however, the prevalence of lesions was 0.002 infected chicks to every handled chick. Of the afflicted chicks, 18 were found dead, but whether the cause of death was due to avian pox or secondary infections is unknown (Kane et al., 2012). Avian pox is also the most common viral infection in albatrosses and large petrels (Uhart et al., 2018). It has been reported from Wandering Albatross (Eudyptes chrysocome) in the Prince Edward Islands in the Indian Ocean, to Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) on Oahu, Hawaii (Young and VanderWerf, 2008), suggesting that albatross populations may be exposed to these viruses worldwide.",

Since that date, Influenza A viruses have been detected in more than 60 seabird species worldwide, mostly in gulls and terns (see Arnal et al., 2014; Lang et al., 2016 for review in gulls and other seabirds, respectively). Birds of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes orders are the main hosts for influenza A viruses (Olsen et al., 2006). Significant variation in virus prevalence have been found between closely related species, but also season and bird colony, suggesting that the transmission dynamics of avian influenza are strongly associated to the ecology of their hosts. Annual epidemics have been found in Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), with peaks of transmission during the breeding season and, in particular, fledgling birds (Verhagen et al., 2014). This supports the idea that bird age is an important factor involved in influenza virus infection. Investigations of virus transmission on tropical oceanic islands have also shown that terns could be involved in the introduction and maintenance of avian influenza viruses in these remote locations (Lebarbenchon et al., 2015).",

DNA fingerprinting has resulted in the identification of at least 16 different serotypes of P. multicoda (Friend and Franson, 1999). Avian cholera has become the most prolific infectious disease of waterbirds, even though it first appeared in North America as recently as 1944. Since then, the disease has expanded globally, and outbreaks have increased in frequency since the 1970s (Friend and Franson, 1999). One of the key reasons avian cholera has been so successful in its spread is due to the multitude of ways P. multicoda can make its way into a host's system. Bird-to-bird contact, ingestion of carcasses or contaminated food/water, insect bites, and even the aerosolisation of the bacteria in heavily contaminated regions can all lead to avian cholera in wild birds (Friend and Franson, 1999). Infections of P. multicoda can be acute or chronic, but in most species studied to date, infections result in death within 24\u201348 h. Mortality in 6\u201312 h has also been reported in wild birds, with peak mortality exceeding more than 1000 birds a day in some cases (Friend and Franson, 1999).",

Despite having now been isolated from dozens of wild terrestrial birds, the effects of B. burgdorferi in these populations is not well understood.

Before avian cholera outbreaks increased in frequency in the past quarter century, avian botulism was considered the most destructive disease in wild birds (Friend and Franson, 1999). Botulism outbreaks can regularly result in the death of thousands of waterbirds and shorebirds in a region and up to a million birds have been lost in a single outbreak of the disease (Friend and Franson, 1999). Blood samples from live birds are needed to identify the toxin in populations, making the study of avian botulism in wild birds a resource dependant endeavour (Friend and Franson, 1999).",

Temperature also plays a critical role in the spread of botulism, with most outbreaks taking place during summer and fall (Friend and Franson, 1999). In wild seabirds, botulism has been isolated from species belonging to Charadriiformes, Pelecaniformes, and Anseriformes (Friend and Franson, 1999; Neimanis et al., 2007; Rocke et al., 2005). The symptoms of the disease in wild seabirds (e.g. Herring Gulls; Larus argentatus) include decreased physical coordination, paralysis of legs and wings, dehydration, and a decrease in food consumption. Avian botulism has caused mass mortality in Herring Gulls in Sweden, and American White Pelicans in North America (Neimanis et al., 2007; Rocke et al., 2005).",

Chlamydia psittaci is the most common species associated with the disease in wild birds. Chlamydiosis can range in pathogenicity in wild birds from inapparent infections to an acute disease with high mortality, depending on the strain of C. psittaci affecting the individual/population (Friend and Franson, 1999). Symptoms in wild birds range from decreased food consumption, pus discharges from the eyes and nares, and bloody diarrhea, to becoming rigid and motionless (Friend and Franson, 1999). Chlamydia species can remain active in the tissues, faeces, discharges, and even plumage of affected birds, and can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact. The only known way to control the spread of the disease in wild birds is by the removal of dead or affected birds from colonies (Friend and Franson, 1999).",

Studies have also isolated C. psittaci from Red-footed (Sula sula) and Nazca Boobies (Sula granti; Padilla et al., 2004). However, since chlamydiosis in wild birds is often inapparent, the effect of the disease on these populations has not been discussed in any of the studies we found.

They are transmitted to wild birds primarily by midges (Culicoides spp.), mosquitoes (Culex and Aedes spp.) and flies (Simulium and Hippoboscidae spp.; Friend and Franson, 1999; Vanstreels et al., 2017). There are currently four primary types of haemosporidia identified in seabirds, each carried by a different type of vector. Plasmodium species are carried by mosquitoes, and are associated with diseases such as malaria in humans (Friend and Franson, 1999; Vanstreels et al., 2017). Haemoproteus species are carried by midges, and Leucocytozoon species are carried by flies (Friend and Franson, 1999). It is unconfirmed what vectors carry Babesia spp., but it is assumed to be ticks (Earl\u00e9 et al., 1993, Yabsley et al., 2009).

However, in the majority of studies, there is little evidence of mortality of wild seabirds caused by haemosporidia (Padilla et al., 2004; Parsons et al., 2017; Peirce and Parsons, 2012; Yabsley et al., 2009). Temperature, migration, and local climatic conditions supporting ectoparasites are key considerations in determining the spread of haemosporidia among wild seabirds (Friend and Franson, 1999; van Riper et al., 2002), and help explain regional prevalence levels (e.g. Bennett et al., 1992; Greiner et al., 1975). For example, Vanstreels et al. (2017) found no evidence of haemosporidia in Magellanic Penguins in the Sub-Antarctic region of Argentina, and Mallory et al. (2007) also found no haemosporidia in Norhern Fulmars from the high Arctic. It is also thought that many haemosporidia are host species specific. For example, Babesia shortii is the only Babesia spp. known to cause pathogenicity in birds (Peirce, 2000). However, it is best studied in Falconidae, and experimental transmissions of the parasite into other terrestrial species have failed in producing pathogenic responses (Peirce, 2000).",

On the other hand, species belonging to Gaviiformes are found in lower densities on the landscape, making population-wide analyses more resource and time intensive. Important to note is that the colonial nature of some species of birds may also make them more vulnerable to higher levels of parasites and pathogens as compared with birds that breed in isolation because of the contact between individuals at bird colonies (e.g. Boulinier et al., 2001, Boulinier et al., 2016; McCoy et al., 2016). For example, in some cliff-nesting seabird species where there is little to no vegetation cover individuals may literally be covered in the faeces of those nesting above them (Fig. 5\n); these faeces are a potential vector for a number of parasites.",

Although adult mortality can be caused by ectoparasites (e.g. Gaston and Elliott, 2013), this occurs most often in cases of hyper-infestations. The most commonly reported impact of ectoparasites on adult seabirds is that of reduced parental care due to parasitism (e.g. Dietrich et al., 2011; Duffy, 1983). Nest abandonment and inconsistent/slower offspring development are the most well-known outcomes. Mortality in fledglings due to parasitism is much more likely, and has been reported in species belonging to six of the eight orders studied here (Table 2).",

Flaviviruses, Chlamydophillia spp., haemosporidia and Borrelia burgdorferi seem to be asymptomatic in seabirds, which makes understanding their relationships with their hosts difficult. In contrast, highly pathogenic avian influenza and avian cholera can cause mass mortality and colony collapses (e.g. Allison et al., 2015; Descamps et al., 2012). Except for these exceptional cases when such massive die-offs are reported, the physiological and behavioural effects of viral and bacterial infections in seabirds remain largely unknown, at both the individual and population levels. This limitation is mostly associated with the inherent properties of viruses and other microparasites. In particular, field investigation of infectious status and prevalence in populations usually requires strict conservation procedures of biological material. Laboratory-based techniques (e.g. molecular biology, virus isolation) in sometimes high security laboratories such as for highly pathogenic avian influenza and West Nile viruses is needed, and certain biological safety precautions are required by law in some regions (e.g. Allison et al., 2015; Lebarbenchon et al., 2010, Lebarbenchon et al., 2015).",

Identifying the links between such basic epidemiological information and host physiological and behavioural traits, in order to assess the precise effects of infection on host fitness, therefore remains very challenging.

Additional observational and experimental studies from a larger range of seabirds aimed at specific parasitic groups would greatly enhance our understanding of these interactions. New methods for investigating the diversity of endoparasites using metabarcoding analyses of faeces may facilitate our understanding of the diversity and distribution of these organisms at different spatial scales (e.g. McInnes et al., 2017), and may enable us to incorporate parasite dynamics into long-term population survey data. Although there are limitations to metabarcoding approaches to studying effects of parasites as metrics beyond presence and absence will be difficult to quantify. Control measures for the spread of parasites are also rudimentary and resource/time intensive. One way to control their spread in seabirds is by the selective removal of afflicted or dead birds from colonies (e.g. Friend and Franson, 1999). Vaccination has also been recently proposed as an effective measure to protect endemic albatrosses from avian cholera (Bourret et al., 2018), and may be an important conservation consideration for seabirds of particular conservation concern, but is not likely a viable solution for more metropolitan species.",

Research shows that abiotic conditions such as heat and humidity, and biotic conditions such as host body condition and colony density, are key factors determining in the spread of parasites within seabird colonies (Caillou\u00ebt et al., 2013; Monticelli et al., 2008; Proctor, 2003; Ramos et al., 2001). Discussing the spread of these parasites on a global scale is more complex, however. Factors such as migration, climate change, and range extension/change for seabirds and parasites alike need to be taken into consideration. Seabirds are often long-lived and highly migratory, so it should come as no surprise that they can act as effective parasite reservoirs and transporters. There is already evidence showcasing range and species expansions for parasites, although the exact factors involved are as yet unknown (de Souza Petersen et al., 2017; Kane et al., 2012). Changing seasonal temperatures and water levels due to climate change can also extend the time period that seabirds can be parasitised by ectoparasites, potentially resulting in increased local abundances and subsequently higher chances of pathogenicity. Increasing anthropogenic pollution and higher water levels due to climate change can further contribute to the spread of devastating diseases such as botulism and cholera (Friend and Franson, 1999; Garamszegi, 2011; Parkinson and Butler, 2005). The interaction between different environmental stressors and parasitism is only recently starting to be considered for understanding the overall impact on seabird populations.",

            "text": "There is clearly a bias towards research interest in seabird parasites that have the capacity to parasitize or infect human beings (i.e. zoonoses). Evidence of this comes from the comparatively extensive research on West Nile virus and Lyme disease, which can be transmitted to humans through vectors such as ticks and mosquitoes. Although direct transmission of pathogens from birds to humans is considered uncommon, little work has been done to assess seabird pathogens in humans and thus this relationship is likely underestimated. Vectors carried by migratory birds can play a role in the transmission of at least 10 different human pathogens (Tsiodras et al., 2008), but a much better understanding of this phenomenon is still required. Recent work by Foss\u00e1dal et al. (2018) has shown a positive association between handling C. psittaci infected juvenile Northern Fulmars\u2014a species hunted for human consumption\u2014and human psittacosis disease in the Fulmar Islands. It is possible that other commonly harvested species, such as eiders and murres may present similar correlations in future works. The aforementioned control measures for diseases such as cholera and influenza also expose human beings to these parasites. With the increased risk of outbreaks in seabirds due to climate change and range expansions, pathogen spillover events will likely become more frequent.",

            "text": "Beyond their zoonotic implications, the impact of parasites on seabirds and human beings have economic and cultural implications. Commonly harvested birds such as Common Eiders and murres have experienced pathogenicity, mortality, and even annual colony collapse due to increased parasitism (Gaston et al., 2002; Gaston and Elliott, 2013; Kristj\u00e1nsson et al., 2016; Lovvorn et al., 2009). Anthropogenic activities such as overfishing and oceanic pollution are also evolving factors contributing to reduced health in seabirds (Braune et al., 2006; Sydeman et al., 2017). The long-term impacts of these changes can contribute to increased, additive mortality caused by parasites in seabird colonies. Changing climatic conditions and food availability have also resulted in seabirds being preyed upon by novel predators (Iverson et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2010). More research on cumulative effects from parasitism, reduced food availability due to anthropogenic activity, and changing predatory interactions is needed to understand the collective impact these factors can have on parasite-host relationships in seabird colonies (Dey et al., 2018; Iverson et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2005). Understanding these interrelations becomes even more crucial when we consider endemic or na\u00efve species of seabirds that may be experiencing increases in multiple stressors due to changing conditions in their habitats. For example, increasing numbers of non-native species in Hawaii have introduced parasites that have led to mass mortality in native songbirds (van Riper et al., 2002). Expanding ranges for parasites and disease vectors have raised similar concerns in Antarctic seabird populations (Grimaldi et al., 2011).",

Not all seabirds come in direct contact with each other in these colonies, however, because of strong territoriality. More research is needed to understand the impact of localised separation in colonial nesting seabirds on the spread of parasites. Colonial nesting might indeed yield some benefits to hosts against certain parasites. For example, Douglas et al. (2005) showed evidence of aldehydes created by Crested Auklets (Aethia cristatella) can effectively repel ectoparasites. There are also studies to suggest that certain species of wild birds can slow the spread of pathogens like West Nile virus (Levine et al., 2016). The role of seabird diversity and abundance in suppressing zoonotic disease is a worthwhile avenue for further study.",
