The duration of this carrier state is variable, ranging in individual animals from months to years (Gaskell et al., 1982, Povey et al., 1973, Wardley, 1976, Wardley and Povey, 1977a). Povey et al. (1973) arbitrarily defined the FCV carrier state as an animal excreting virus for a minimum of 30 days post infection. Some experimental studies have shown that most cats are shedding virus at 30 days post infection, but by 75 days only about 50% of these are still persistently infected (Gaskell et al., 1982, Wardley and Povey, 1977a). The decline in the proportion of cats shedding virus appears to be exponential, with only a minority of animals becoming long-term carriers. In other experimental studies however, the carrier state has been less easily established, suggesting various host or virus factors may also play a role (Knowles et al., 1991, Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995).",

Such carriers have been defined as high, medium or low-level shedders, according to the mean titre of virus recovered from the oropharynx (Wardley, 1976). High-level carriers are easily detectable and are thought to be of considerable risk to susceptible cats. In contrast, low-level carriers may be more difficult to detect and a series of swabs may be required to detect shedding over the minimum 30-day period defined for FCV carriers (Povey et al., 1973).",

Such figures are broadly similar to those found in prevalence studies carried out in healthy cats prior to the introduction of vaccination (Wardley et al., 1974), and support the finding that vaccination does not prevent infection or the development of the carrier state (Dawson et al., 1991, Gaskell et al., 1982, Gaskell et al., 2004b, Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995). In general, most of the infected animals in such studies are thought to be persistently infected carriers, although it has been recognised that some may be cats undergoing re-infection, or subclinical infection with an avirulent strain (Wardley et al., 1974).",

In order to address this, an in-depth longitudinal study of FCV prevalence and viral shedding patterns in five naturally infected cat colonies over a 15\u201346-month period was carried out. Demographic characteristics and other individual cat and colony factors were also obtained in order to determine possible risk factors for FCV carriage.",

Not all isolates were sequenced successfully, and it is possible that other strains were present in some cats/colonies which may not have been detected by the primers used. Such PCR failure has been reported in other studies with FCV as well as for other caliciviruses (Green et al., 1995, Radford et al., 2001b).",

Virus was also present in each of the colonies despite active vaccination. Such variation in prevalence may be influenced by a number of host, population, management and viral factors, including, for example, the level of pre-existing immunity within the cats.

Whether or not the cat that appears negative either on some or all occasions are truly negative, or whether it is a sampling artefact, is not clear. Nevertheless it does seem likely that animals vary in their sensitivity to FCV infection despite being in the same colony with similar exposure factors. This is clearly demonstrated by three adult cats in colony D that were siblings (cats 2 and 4, both consistent shedders, and cat 27, an intermittent shedder).

Identifying such cats would be crucial to eliminating virus from infected colonies. Why some animals appear to shed virus more consistently than others is not clear. There are a number of possible reasons, apart from the sampling procedure, that may account for this. For example, Wardley (1976) suggested that intermittent shedders may shed lower levels of virus, which sometimes fall below the sensitivity of the cell culture test, rather than truly fluctuating between a positive and negative state. However, in our study there was no significant difference in mean viral titres between the consistent and intermittent shedder groups. In addition, viral shedding patterns did not appear to be influenced by whether individual cats were infected with the same strain of virus over time, or were undergoing re-infection with a different strain.",

This present study confirmed such findings in that each colony appeared to be infected with between one and three distinct strains of virus. It is possible that other strains were also present in some colonies, as not all isolates were amplifiable on PCR, possibly because of sequence variability particularly in the hypervariable region E of the FCV capsid region of the genome used for PCR (Neill, 1992, Radford et al., 2001b, Seal et al., 1993). Interestingly, one of the strains identified in colony E appeared to be the vaccine strain F9. This colony was known to use live F9-based vaccine, resulting in the possibility that F9 virus may have become established in the colony from the vaccine. Virus closely related to vaccine strain F9 has also been reported in other groups of cats (Horimoto et al., 2001, Radford et al., 2001a).",

As a consequence the emergence of distinct viral populations may occur, contributing to viral persistence. Previous studies have shown that alterations in the antigenic profile of FCVs isolated from carrier cats are highly suggestive of positive selection that is likely to be immune driven, and which may ultimately lead to the elimination of virus (Kreutz et al., 1998, Radford et al., 1998, Radford et al., 2003). In this context, we observed a decline in viral titre shed by four cats in colony D prior to the apparent elimination of virus, as has been seen in similar circumstances in foot and mouth disease virus (Hughes et al., 2002).",

However, within endemically infected colonies, where there is generally close contact between cats, it is likely that all carriers have the potential to transmit infection. There was also evidence to suggest that the overall titre of virus shed in certain colonies was higher than others. For example, cats in colonies D and E shed significantly more virus than cats in A and C. This suggests that differences between the colonies such as host, viral or environmental factors may affect the amounts of virus shed and hence transmissibility.",

Such resistance to infection may be as a result of genetic or acquired immunity. For human caliciviruses (noroviruses), resistance/susceptibility of an individual to infection with a given strain is associated with variability in the expression of surface carbohydrates belonging to the ABH histo-blood group antigens, which are used by the virus for cell attachment (Harrington et al., 2004, Hutson et al., 2003, Lindesmith et al., 2003). Recently the junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM-1) has been suggested to be a receptor for FCV (Makino et al., 2006) and it would be interesting to investigate JAM-1 polymorphisms in susceptible and resistant cats.",

However, immunity following experimental FCV infection is not normally sterile (Dawson et al., 1991, Gaskell et al., 1982, Knowles et al., 1991). This study therefore suggests that other factors, such as repeated challenge or genetic differences (as above) may also play a role in generating resistance to infection. It is possible that serological studies might have clarified the immune status of the cats and whether there were differences between the shedding and non-shedding groups. However, since all of the cats in this study were regularly vaccinated, interpretation of antibody titres would have been problematic, since it would have been difficult to distinguish between neutralising antibodies present due to vaccination and those due to field infection. Based on risk factors for FCV carriage, there was no relationship between vaccination status (past or present vaccine) and FCV shedding.",

The study shows that FCV can remain at a relatively high prevalence in colonies of cats over long periods of time, despite widespread use of vaccination. The observed high prevalence is maintained by large numbers of generally asymptomatically infected cats in colonies where a small number of distinct FCV strains are circulating. A spectrum of FCV shedding patterns were identified with cats broadly grouping into three categories; consistent shedders, intermittent shedders and non-shedders. The basis of the apparent resistance of the non-shedders remains to be determined, but may either be immune-mediated, or possibly host receptor driven.",
