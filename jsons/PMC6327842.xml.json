In the past decade, the discovery and characterization of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem have provided invaluable insights for development of a universal influenza vaccine (Impagliazzo et al., 2015, Wu and Wilson, 2018, Yassine et al., 2015). The HA stem domain, unlike the receptor-binding head domain, is highly conserved across influenza strains and subtypes (Nobusawa et al., 1991). Therefore, antibodies that target the HA stem usually have much greater breadth than those that target the hypervariable head (Wu and Wilson, 2017), which is the location of the major antigenic sites (Gerhard et al., 1981, Wiley et al., 1981). Consequently, elicitation of stem-binding bnAbs has become a major goal for universal influenza vaccine development (Erbelding et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Understanding features that are common to bnAbs isolated from different individuals, whether through natural infection or vaccination, is important for immunogen design in the development of a universal influenza vaccine. As more and more influenza bnAbs are characterized, several multidonor classes of bnAbs have begun to emerge (Avnir et al., 2014, Joyce et al., 2016, Wu and Wilson, 2017). Stem-binding bnAbs that utilize VH1-69 germline genes are probably the most well-characterized multidonor class (Dreyfus et al., 2012, Ekiert et al., 2009, Kashyap et al., 2008, Lang et al., 2017, Sui et al., 2009, Throsby et al., 2008), and the alleles used code for a signature motif consisting of Ile53 and Phe54 in complementarity-determining region (CDR) H2 and Tyr98 in CDR H3 (Avnir et al., 2014, Lang et al., 2017). Recently, Joyce et al. reported three additional multidonor classes of bnAbs (Joyce et al., 2016): (1) bnAbs that utilize VH6-1 and D3-3 germline genes with a signature motif consisting of MIFGI in CDR H3; (2) bnAbs that utilize VH1-18 and D3-9 with a signature motif of RXXILTG in CDR H3; and (3) bnAbs that utilize VH1-18 and a QXXV motif in CDR H3. It is likely that more multidonor classes of bnAbs have yet to be discovered.",

            "text": "We describe here the structure of bnAb S9-3-37, which targets the HA stem mainly using a relatively long CDR H3 of 21 residues. Interestingly, CDR H3 of S9-3-37 has a very similar conformation as that of a pan-influenza A bnAb FI6v3 (Corti et al., 2011), despite the huge disparity in their overall orientations with respect to the HA stem. Both S9-3-37 and FI6v3 utilize the D3-9 gene segment and encode an LXYFXWL motif in CDR H3 that is critical for targeting the most conserved part of the stem epitope. We further performed a structural comparison between S9-3-37 and 31.b.09 (Joyce et al., 2016), which also utilizes the D3-9 gene segment. Our analysis reveals that the D3-9 gene segments of S9-3-37 and 31.b.09 are translated in different reading frames. Nonetheless, Phe in the D-3-9-encoded LXYFXWL motif of S9-3-37 and Leu in the D3-9-encoded ILTG motif of 31.b.09 targets the same pocket in the HA stem. Moreover, both reading frames of the D3-9 gene segment are utilized by influenza bnAbs from multiple vaccinated individuals (Joyce et al., 2016) and can be found in the B cell repertoires of healthy donors (DeKosky et al., 2015). Overall, this study reveals that the D3-9 gene segment offers a recurrent and robust strategy for targeting the HA stem in which at least two different binding poses can be utilized depending on the reading frame.",

            "text": "S9-3-37 is a group 1-specific bnAb that was isolated from healthy volunteers who were vaccinated with the H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccine (Yamayoshi et al., 2018). S9-3-37 uses the VH1-18 and V\u03ba2-24 heavy- and light-chain V genes, respectively (Figure S1A-B), and binds to group 1 HAs with high affinity, but with no detectable binding to group 2 HAs (Table 1\n). Here, we determined the crystal structure of S9-3-37 Fab in complex with the HA from an H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Viet04) to 2.9 \u00c5 resolution (Table S1; Figure S2). S9-3-7 binds to the HA stem region (Figure 1\nA), and one structural feature that immediately stands out is the extensive contact of CDR H3 with the stem region (Figure 1B). The overall conformation of CDR H3 of S9-3-37 at the HA-Fab interface is remarkably similar to that of CDR H3 of FI6v3 (Corti et al., 2011). Moreover, the molecular interactions attributable to the D gene segment are almost identical between S9-3-37 and FI6v3. While S9-3-37 and FI6v3 utilize different VH and J gene segments, they both utilize the D3-9 gene segment and have a relatively long CDR H3 (Figure S1C). CDR H3 of FI6v3 is 20 residues, whereas that of S9-3-37 is 21 residues (Kabat numbering). Interestingly, despite the similarity in the conformation of CDR H3, the overall orientations of S9-3-37 and FI6v3 are very different (Figure 1A). When bound to HA, S9-3-37 adopts an \u223c180\u00b0 rotation relative to FI6v3, such that the positions of the heavy chain and light chain are swapped compared to FI6v3 with respect to their interaction with the HA stem epitope. To understand the difference in the HA binding orientation of S9-3-37 and FI6v3, structural alignments between their variable domains of heavy chains (VH) were performed. When their D gene-encoded regions are superimposed, the base of their CDR H3s twist with respect to each other (Figure 1C). When their VH framework regions are aligned, the CDR H3 loops of S9-3-37 and FI6v3 point in opposite directions (Figure 1D). Together, our structural analysis reveals that the S9-3-37 and FI6v3 antibodies engage the HA stem surface in very different overall orientations and angles of approach, but nevertheless still have very similar CDR H3 conformations, especially for the residues that are important for engaging the conserved HA stem epitope.",

The paratope of S9-3-37 is dominated by CDR H3, similar to FI6v3 (Figures 2A and 2B) (Corti et al., 2011), and only one framework residue interacts with the HA (VL Asp1 hydrogen bonds with HA1 Asn289 glycan; Figure S3A). The total BSA on S9-3-37 is 910 \u00c52 (868 \u00c52 from the heavy chain and 42 \u00c52 from the light chain), with 83% (756 \u00c52) attributable to CDR H3. In comparison, the total BSA on FI6v3 is 903 \u00c52 (714 \u00c52 from the heavy chain and 189 \u00c52 from the light chain), with 71% (638 \u00c52) from CDR H3. Similarly, the BSA on the HA is comparable in the S9-3-37-HA complex (832 \u00c52) and FI6v3-HA complex (817 \u00c52). Thus, binding of S9-3-37 to the HA is dominated by the relatively long CDR H3, which is similar to that of FI6v3. In CDR H3 of S9-3-37, the D3-9 gene encodes for seven residues 100bLGYFDWL100h (Figures 2C and S1C). With the exception of Gly100c and Asp100f, the other five hydrophobic residues (Leu100b, Tyr100d, Phe100e, Trp100g, and Leu100h) all interact with the HA stem. Of note, all of these five contacting residues are encoded by the germline D3-9, and therefore, none arise from somatic mutations. The buried surface area of this D3-9-encoded region is 495 \u00c52 (Figure 2D), which accounts for 54% of the total BSA of S9-3-37. This observation further highlights the importance of the D3-9 gene segment in binding to the HA stem.",

Among the 17 residues in CDR H2, eight are somatically mutated from the inferred germline gene (Figure S1A). N54D and N56K in CDR H2 engage in electrostatic interactions with HA1 Lys32 and HA2 Asp57, respectively (Figure S3B). N56K, along with N58K, also hydrogen bonds with Gln99 in CDR H3 (Figure S3C). These observations suggest that somatic mutations in CDR H2 not only facilitate interactions with HA but also help stabilize the base of CDR H3. Therefore, somatic mutations in CDR H2 are likely to play a critical role during affinity maturation of S9-3-37.",

In contrast, some HA residues (HA1 18, 38, 39, 40, 291, 292, and 318; and HA2 36, 50, and 54) are only targeted by S9-3-7, but not FI6v3, and vice versa (HA1 residues 8, 28, 29, 30, 287, 290, and 316; and HA2 residues 39 and 43). Those shared epitope residues, which are targeted by CDR H3 (Figure 3A), are more conserved than those epitope residues that are unique to either S9-3-37 or FI6v3 (Figures 3B and S4). In contrast to FI6v3, which bind to both groups 1 and 2 HAs, S9-3-37 only binds to group 1 HAs. Natural amino acid variants in HA1 residue 38 and HA2 residue 50, both of which are epitope residues unique to S9-3-37, may explain the narrower breadth in S9-3-37 as compared to FI6v3. Most group 1 HAs carry an Asn at HA2 residue 50, whereas HA2 residue 50 is highly conserved as Gly among group 2 HAs (Figure S3D). In our crystal structure, HA2 Asn50 forms an H-bond with Arg97 of S9-3-37 VH (Figure S3E). When Gly is present at HA2 residue 50, this H-bond interaction would be abolished, which can partially explain lack of binding of S9-3-37 to group 2 HAs. In HA1 residue 38, an N-glycosylation site is present in most group 2 HAs, but not in group 1 HAs, and can provide steric hindrance to the HA stem epitope (Figure S3F). CDR L1 of S9-3-37 is spatially proximal to HA1 residue 38 (Figure S3G), and a glycan at HA1 residue 38 in group 2 HAs would likely clash with CDR L1 of S9-3-37. In comparison, although CDR H2 of FI6v3 occupies a similar space (Figure S3G), it is more distant from HA1 residue 38, which allows it to accommodate a glycan at HA1 residue 38. In fact, the N-glycosylation site at HA1 Asn38 has limited the ability of several stem-binding bnAbs to neutralize group 2 influenza subtypes (Wu and Wilson, 2017). Subsequently, these analyses show that while both S9-3-37 and FI6v3 utilize a long CDR H3 to target the most conserved part of the epitope, other epitope residues that are unique to each antibody are less conserved and play a critical role in determining their breadth. The different angles of approach may also be critical for the difference in breadth between S9-3-37 and FI6v3, as shown for VH1-69-encoded bnAbs (Lang et al., 2017).",

Their study discovered a number of bnAbs, including one called 31.b.09, that utilized VH1-18 and D3-9 (Joyce et al., 2016), which is the same as in S9-3-37. Nonetheless, when we compared the sequence of S9-3-37 to that of 31.b.09, we noticed that their D3-9 gene segments were translated in different reading frames (Figure 4\nA). In other words, despite the usage of the same D gene segment, the corresponding amino acid sequences in the D gene-encoded regions of S9-3-37 and 31.b.09 are totally different. The D3-9 gene segment in S9-3-37 encodes for amino acids LGYFDWL, whereas the D3-9 gene segment in 31.b.09 encodes for amino acids ILTG. When we compared the structure of S9-3-37-HA complex with that of 31.b.09-HA complex (PDB 5K9O) (Joyce et al., 2016), we found that the Phe within the LGYFDWL motif in S9-3-37 and Leu within the ILTG motif in 31.b.09 occupy the same pocket in the HA stem region. This observation demonstrates that the D3-9 gene segment can engage the HA stem with two different reading frames. Unlike the two reading frames outlined above, the third reading frame of D3-9 gene segment contains a stop codon in the middle of the translated protein sequence, making it unlikely to be utilized (Figure S5A).",

Based on a motif searching approach (see STAR Methods), we classified the CDR H3 sequence of each B cell clone that utilized the D3-9 gene segment into S9-3-37-like or 31.b.09-like. Briefly, those D3-9-encoded CDR H3 sequences that contained an LXYFXWL motif, where X represents any amino acid, were classified as S9-3-37-like. Those D3-9-encoded CDR H3 sequences that contained an ILTG motif, with one mismatch allowed at position 1, 3, or 4 (i.e., no variation was allowed for Leu at the second position), were classified as 31.b.09-like. S9-3-37-like CDR H3 could be observed in four heterosubtypic cross-reactive B cells from subjects 31, 54, and 56, whereas 31.b.09-like CDR H3 could be observed in 78 heterosubtypic cross-reactive B cells from subjects 1, 16, and 31 (Figures 4C and 4D; Table S2). The four S9-3-37-like CDR H3 sequences identified in this analysis are relatively long (19\u201326 residues, Figure 4D), as also seen in S9-3-37 (21 amino acid) and FI6v3 (20 amino acid), suggesting that they may bind to HA stem in a similar manner to S9-3-37 and FI6v3. Joyce et al. indeed showed that antibodies from three of those four B cell clones (31.d.01, 54.e.01, and 56.h.01) could neutralize multiple influenza subtypes (Joyce et al., 2016). Of note, both 31.d.01 and 56.h.01 are group 1-specific bnAbs, whereas 54.e.01 can neutralize viruses from both group 1 and group 2.",

Despite the vast difference in the overall conformations of the CDR H3 loops in 27-1C08 (PDB 5WCA) (Andrews et al., 2017) and S9-3-37, the conformations of their D3-9-encoded regions are highly similar (Figure S6A). While the structure of 27-1C08 in complex with HA is not available, our observations suggest that the D3-9-encoded regions from 27-1C08 would bind to the same stem pocket as S9-3-37. These results also support the notion that the D3-9 gene segment provides a recurring strategy to target the HA stem.",

Both 31.b.09-like and S9-3-37-like CDR H3 sequences could be found (Figure 5\nA), although the frequency of 31.b.09-like CDR H3 sequences (\u223c1%) was much higher than S9-3-37-like CDR H3 sequences (\u223c0.01% to \u223c0.1%). S9-3-37-like CDR H3s with at least 20 amino acids long could be observed in two of the three healthy donors (Figure 5B). This analysis shows that B cells that utilize S9-3-37-like CDR H3, despite being less common than 31.b.09-like CDR H3, are prevalent in the B cell repertoires of healthy donors.",

The first dataset describes the memory B cell repertoires from four donors after administration of two meningococcal vaccines (Galson et al., 2015). The second dataset describes the memory B cell repertoire from three time points that are 1\u20132 years apart in an HIV-infected patient (Huang et al., 2016). As compared to the 1,246 HA cross-reactive antibodies that were analyzed above (Figures 4B, 4C, and S5B\u2013S5E), the S9-3-37-like CDR H3 is rare in the memory B cell repertoires of the four meningococcal-vaccinated individuals and the HIV-infected patient (Figure 6\n). Among HA cross-reactive antibodies, the frequency of S9-3-37-like CDR H3 (2.2%, 27 out of 1,246) is \u223c3-fold lower than that of 31.b.09-like CDR H3 (6.7%, 84 out of 1,246). In contrast, in the memory B cell repertoires of meningococcal-vaccinated individuals and the HIV-infected patient, an S9-3-37-like CDR H3 is either undetectable or >100-fold less prevalent than the 31.b.09-like CDR H3. This analysis suggests that, while 31.b.09-like CDR H3 may be involved at very low frequencies in targeting other non-HA antigens, S9-3-37-like CDR H3 is much more specific for targeting the HA stem region.",

Nonetheless, in these two HIV bnAbs, the D3-9 gene segment only encodes for two to three amino acids (Figures S7B and S7C). Therefore, D3-9 gene segment in these two HIV bnAbs is unlikely to be as critical for engaging the epitope. Consistent with the analysis of memory B cell repertoires (Figure 6), the result here implies that the D3-9 gene segment has a specific role in bnAbs that target influenza HA, but not in other microbial antigens analyzed to date.",

VH1-69 is perhaps the most well-known \u201cSOS component\u201d of the antibody repertoire (Dreyfus et al., 2012, Ekiert et al., 2009, Kashyap et al., 2008, Lang et al., 2017, Lerner, 2011, Lerner, 2016, Sui et al., 2009, Throsby et al., 2008). Our results suggest that the D3-9 gene segment is another \u201cSOS component\u201d of the antibody repertoire. However, it seems the response from D3-9 gene segment is not as general as VH1-69. VH1-69 is frequently observed in immune response against pathogens other than influenza virus, such as hepatitis C virus (Marasca et al., 2001), HIV (Gorny et al., 2012, Luftig et al., 2006), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Ying et al., 2015). In contrast, our analysis indicates that D3-9 gene segment, especially the reading frame that encodes the motif LXYFXWL (S9-3-37-like CDR H3), is more specific to influenza virus (Figures 6 and S7). To date, most large-scale analyses on germline usage have focused on VH gene segments. Future analysis should investigate whether other D gene segments and even JH gene segments contribute to the \u201cSOS component\u201d of the antibody repertoire.",

            "text": "Structural characterization of multidonor class bnAbs has been highly valuable for development of the universal influenza vaccine using a reverse-engineering approach. For example, two different headless HA immunogens (Impagliazzo et al., 2015, Yassine et al., 2015) were designed based on the binding modes of CR9114 (Dreyfus et al., 2012) and CR6261 (Ekiert et al., 2009, Throsby et al., 2008), which are both VH1-69-encoded bnAbs. Structural characterization of such bnAbs also provides templates for antiviral development (Wu and Wilson, 2018). These HA stem-binding bnAbs have also inspired the design of small proteins and peptides that display antiviral activities (Chevalier et al., 2017, Fleishman et al., 2011, Kadam et al., 2017, Whitehead et al., 2012). In fact, a small neutralizing peptide that binds to the HA stem was designed primarily based on CDR H3 of bnAb FI6v3 containing the D3-9-encoded LXYFXWL motif (Kadam et al., 2017) (PDB 5W6T; Figure S6B). We anticipate that future discovery and characterization of multidonor class bnAbs will continue to provide insight into antiviral and vaccine design against influenza virus.",

            "text": "As several HA stem-binding bnAbs are currently being tested in clinical trials for both prophylactic and therapeutic usage (Sparrow et al., 2016), it is equally important to understand the potential for bnAb escape. Although it is generally more difficult for influenza virus to escape from stem antibodies compared to head antibodies (Anderson et al., 2017, Chai et al., 2016, Doud et al., 2018, Ekiert et al., 2009, Sui et al., 2009, Throsby et al., 2008, Yamayoshi et al., 2018), strong escape mutations have been identified for several HA stem-binding bnAbs (Anderson et al., 2017, Chai et al., 2016, Ekiert et al., 2011, Friesen et al., 2014, Henry Dunand et al., 2015, Yamayoshi et al., 2018). Most of the escape mutations dramatically decrease the binding affinity to bnAbs. Nonetheless, increasing the membrane fusion pH of the HA can also contribute to HA stem-binding bnAb escape (Chai et al., 2016). A previous study by some of the authors here has shown that HA1 N21S/Y (residue 11 in H1 numbering), which eliminates the highly conserved N-glycosylation site at HA1 Asn21, abolished the neutralization activity of several HA stem-binding bnAbs, including S9-3-37 (Yamayoshi et al., 2018). Interestingly, Asn21 is not part of the S9-3-37 epitope (Figures S6C and S6D), suggesting that the escape mechanism of N21S/Y is not due to a loss of a direct interaction that could decrease binding to S9-3-37. Rather, such S9-3-37 escape could be due to an increase in the membrane fusion pH, since removal of the N-glycosylation site at Asn21 has been suggested to decrease the pH stability of the virus and, hence, make it more fusion sensitive at higher pH (Yin et al., 2017). While the HA stem is a promising target for antiviral and vaccine design, future studies of potential escape mechanisms will be critical for the development of a robust anti-influenza strategy.",

Recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGene HD (Promega). HA was expressed by infecting suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) with baculovirus at an MOI of 5 to 10 and incubating at 28\u00b0C shaking at 110 rpm for 72 hours. The supernatant was concentrated. HA0 was purified by Ni-NTA and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. For binding experiments, HA0 was biotinylated as described (Ekiert et al., 2012) and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Hiload 16/90 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. For crystallization, Viet04 HA0 was treated with trypsin (New England Biolabs) to remove the C-terminal tag (BirA biotinylation site, thrombin cleavage site, trimerization domain, and the His6 tag) and to produce the cleaved mature HA (HA1/HA2). The trypsin-digested Viet04 HA was then purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Hiload 16/90 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3.",

Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained with a reservoir solution containing 20% PEG 6000, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0 at 20\u00b0C.",

Four subjects were analyzed in the Meningococcal vaccine dataset (Galson et al., 2015). Three time points that were 1\u20132 years apart were analyzed in the HIV dataset (Huang et al., 2016). The number of CDR H3 sequences being analyzed (n) in each sample is indicated. Data points are plotted on the x axis if their occurrence frequency equals zero.",
