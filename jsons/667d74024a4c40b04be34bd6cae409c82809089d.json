The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is unique and unprecedented in several aspects and has challenged health care systems across the globe. The coronavirus pandemic has turned the world's attention to the immune system, the body's defence force against disease-causing bacteria, viruses and other organisms that we touch, ingest and inhale every day 1 . Alongside investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the fundamental physiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and rational design of effective therapies 2 . Our immune systems will need to adapt unaided to COVID-19, until a potential vaccine is available.",

The immune system is the body's multi-level defence network against potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and other organisms. The role of psychosocial factors in increasing susceptibility to viral respiratory tract infection is well documented 6 . Further, Poor mental health conditions, including stress and depression, are associated with increased risk of acute respiratory infections.",

The term Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). The classic Ayurveda text Charaka Samhita, mentioned about epidemic management and defines immunity as the ability to preventing and arresting the progression of disease for maintaining homeostasis 7 . The Ayurveda pays larger emphasis on building strength of mind and body to cope with various stressors, including infection. Similar to innate and acquired immunity, the Ayurveda concept of immunity (Bala or strength) is classified as natural (Sahaja), chronobiologic (Kalaja), and acquired (Yuktikrut) 7 .",

These interventions can be quickly implemented on large scale with the advantages of simplicity, affordability, and acceptability. This is clearly evident that such traditional measures can positively influence mental health and immune function through modulating psychoneuroimmune pathways. Presently, several allopathic drugs are under investigations for prophylactic use against COVID-19 and it seems current prophylactic measures are insufficient. The prophylactic and therapeutic potential of traditional and complementary medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Yoga can be proven effective prophylaxis and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.",
