This is presented in the form of certain clinical signs and symptoms which is known as \"sick-bird syndrome.\" The pet birds have their unique physiology and anatomy and their metabolic turnover is quite high. The feeding practice adopted by owner may have an impact over their health status. Birds are kept confined with limited exercise and they are deliberately kept isolated from their foraging behaviour. All these may have an impact over their health status. Diagnosis of these diseases is necessary to adopt a correct treatment or management protocol. However, this is rather complex in caged birds as many of the birds may not exhibit any clinical manifestation as such. By the time these symptoms are presented birds become really sick. Many of systemic diseases are presented with same cluster of symptoms. Moreover, they have a tendency to hide their illness as common tendency of all prey animals. Therefore, the observable and detectable clinical signs indicate a grave concern. Even a little manipulation may lead to serious consequences.",

Unlike mammals where insulin has a predominant role in DM, in birds blood glucose level seems to be controlled by a complex hormonal milieu. In comparison to mammalian pancreas, avian pancreas has a low proportion of insulin secreting cells and 5-6 times higher number of glucagon producing cells. Circulating glucagon concentration in avian blood is 10-50 times higher than the mammalian blood. Glucagon as a catabolic hormone plays a pivotal role in gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and glycogenolysis to augment the blood glucose level, while insulin controls the entry of glucose in the cells and its utilization. In birds particularly in granivorous species, Glucagon is considered to play a more relevant role for development of DM. However, other factors like somatostatin, growth hormone, epinephrine, thyroxine, prolactin, pancreatic polypeptides and corticosteroid may have a modulatory role in development of persistent hyperglycemia. Hyper production of any of these hormones either due to tumor of the hormone producing cells or due to paraneoplastic syndrome may lead to such condition.

However, detection of blood glucose level is tricky in birds as the avian blood glucose level is higher than in mammalian. Therefore, consistently higher level of blood glucose 38-44 mmol/l is indicative of DM in birds. Other than glucose, presence of ketone bodies in urine is also indicative of DM in birds. Clinical symptoms in some other conditions often resemble with the classical symptoms of DM in birds. Polyuria/polydipsia (PU/PD) syndrome is very common in pigeons which fed the squabs crop milk possibly due to decreased concentration of circulating prolactin. Likewise, infection of paramyxovirus serotype-1 may cause lasting PU/PD syndrome in pigeons. Again psychogenic PU/PD is also not uncommon in caged birds. Further, glycosuria has been detected in birds like African Grey Parrot without hyperglycemia. Thus glycosuria, even though an important indicator, cannot be considered alone for diagnosis of DM in avian. Moreover, other conditions like diabetes insipidus, medication with corticosteroids, diuretics, progesterone, renal or hepatic insufficiency, other hormonal irregularities should be considered before definite diagnosis of DM in birds.",

            "text": "Management of DM is always a challenge. In birds it is more difficult as it is not easy to monitor the blood glucose level and thereby to evaluate the effect of the hypoglycemic drugs. The main objective of the treatment is to lower down the blood glucose level and maintain it. The treatment constitutes of insulin and other hypoglycemic drugs like sulfonylurea. The acute rise of blood glucose level can be treated with short acting insulin @ 0.1-0.2 U/kg. However, to maintain the blood glucose level persistently long acting insulin is prescribed with a varying dose (0.067-3.3 U/kg OD/BID) depending upon the clinical improvement and the blood glucose or urinary glucose level. Insulin is recorded to cause hypoglycemic shock in human. However, such instances were not recorded in birds. But possibility of such fallout cannot be denied. To avoid such happenings repeated sampling is required to monitor the blood glucose level making this quite difficult in birds. Oral hypoglycemic agents like sulfonylurea is good alternative. Sulfonylurea is known to stimulate the pancreatic beta cell to secrete endogenous insulin and to increase tissue sensitivity towards insulin. However, its efficacy in birds with insulin resistance is not properly known. Although insulin has been reported for treatment of DM in birds, its real efficacy is controversial in granivorous birds which are known to exhibit insulin insensitivity. Carnivorous birds may be more amicable to insulin therapy.",

Due to constant exposure of the environmental air the capillary bed of alveoli and air sac are very vulnerable to gas, vapors, toxic ingredients, various microbes and toxic particles. At the same time the system is also prone to injury from the haematogenous insults. To protect from the environmental hazard the bronchioles are layered with ciliated epithelial cells and there is also a water protein layer enriched with lysozyme to protect from the pathogens. The non-ciliated granular clara cells lining the bronchioles are important for detoxification of the foreign proteins and drugs. However, alveoli contain a very delicate structure consisting of three layers-endothelium, alveolar interstitium and alveolar epithelium consisting of type I and II pneumocytes. Pulmonary surfactant with phospholipid is instrumental to maintain the surface tension and to stabilize the alveoli preventing its collapse during expiration. Besides, the pulmonary defense mechanism is coordinated by mucociliary defense mechanism and mononuclear phagocyte system of the respiratory system (alveolar and interstitial macrophages). Mucus is produced by goblet and submucosal cell and contains water, glycoprotein, lipid and salt. Mucociliary defense mechanism can protect the initial insult by dissolving the foreign agents like bacteria, toxic gas and foreign injurious particles and propelling them out. Alveolar macrophages are derived from blood monocytes and are highly active phagocytic cells which can readily ingest bacteria and other particles reaching to the alveoli.

In many cases physical, psychological and other factors may contribute for such development. The main factors are discussed here-1. Endocrinological complication: Exclusively hypothyroidism often contributes to such feather plucking behavior. Such low level of thyroid usually leads to loss of feather with a thickened greasy appearance of skin. 2. Malnutrition: Deficiency of some key minerals like zinc, hypovitaminosis A, E and lack of essential fatty acid may lead to loss of skin and feather texture in birds. Dry skin with abnormal keratinization may cause such syndrome. 3. Boredom and stress: Psittacine birds are intelligent which need a constant physical and mental stimulation for their wellbeing. If the birds are left alone and the birds are not in interaction with other birds of the flock or they are not getting intimate touch of human beings such destructive behavior may be developed. 4. Improper wing trimming often causes as irritation which instigate the birds to develop such habit. 5. Heavy metal toxicity, aerosol contamination, smoke, excessive humid environment are other triggering factors. 6. It may completely psychological when the birds are trying to capture the attention of the owner or some kind of anxiety or stress may stimulate the birds to develop such kind of syndrome. This ultimately leads to obsessive compulsive or stereotyped behavior pattern of feather destruction. 7. During vitellogenesis with enlargement of oviduct and ovary, the affected birds may feel discomfort and may exhibit such feather plucking in the areas of thigh and ventral abdomen. 8. Parasitic infection, particularly giardiasis is associated with such problem. 9. Systemic illness like hepatopathy, pancreatitis, renal diseases, neoplasia, and osteomyelitis may also triggers such behaviour due to chronic stress and discomfort exerted on the birds (Fig. 3.8) .",

On the other hand phosphorous acts as urinary acidifier thus prevent the formation of urate crystals in kidney or ureter. Vitamin A is also required to maintain the epithelial lining of renal tubules. Water deprivation, cold weather and other stress factors may also be responsible for gout in the pet birds. Many pet owners preferred to keep parrots on fruits. High fructose content of the fruits is believed by many to cause gout in human; however, it has not been properly confirmed. Viral infectious agents like avian nephritis virus and nephropathogenic strains of infectious bronchitis virus may act as important predisposing factor for gout with prior damage to kidney either by virus or by the deposition of antigen-antibody complex on glomerulus with prolonged infection.

Almost 80% of the nitrogenous waste is being excreted in the form of uric acid in birds via tubular secretion. As this process is independent of tubular water reabsorption, hydration status of the birds hardly influence the uric acid excretion. However, impairment of kidney function may interfere the excretion of uric acid leading to hyperuricemia. In human hyperuricemia occurs when the plasma concentration of uric acid is more than 380-400 \u00b5mol/l. However, solubility of uric acid is higher in birds due to higher body temperature as well as higher sodium concentration in the avian plasma. However, when renal function is severely compromised at the level of about 70%, plasma uric acid concentration is abruptly elevated with deposition of uric acids in several locations. The high dietary protein level was often recorded to precipitate high uric acid level in the birds. This is common in budgerigars for the protein concentration of the feeding pellets. Surplus protein is catabolized and nitrogenous waste is converted into uric acid. When the total amount of uric acid produced overpower the clearing efficacy of the kidney, hyperuricemia develops and uric acid is deposited in various places. The higher plasma concentration of uric acid often leads to the development of articular gout with formation of deformed limbs and joints. Synovial joints sheaths and joints are preferred predilection sites possibly because of the lower temperature of these areas. Gradual accumulation of uric acid leads to formation of \"tophi\" and nodules.",

Enterotoxigenic E. coli and the endotoxin liberated from these organisms may cause severe life-threatening infection. Infection by Gram positive anaerobic spore forming Clostridium perfringens type A and C can cause severe infection in young birds following abrupt changes in diet. They are responsible for foul smelling diarrhea with occasional hemorrhagic spots in fecal samples, necrotic enteritis, malignant edema and gangrenous dermatitis. Diagnosis can be done by gram stating the fecal samples revealing boat shaped Gram positive spore forming bacillus. The small intestine reveals presence of petechial hemorrhagic spots. Treatment with apple cider vinegar (10 ml/l of drinking water), penicillin and metronidazole (40-80 mg/l water) can be effective. Both the E. coli and Clostridial infections are common in psittacine birds particularly among cockatoos. Salmonella is another food and water borne infectious bacterial pathogen which is responsible for necrotic and ulcerative enteritis, diarrhea, respiratory infection, airsacculitis, and sinusitis, septic arthritis associated with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, orchitis and oophoritis. This is a common pathogen detected in all the items present in close contact of the birds and adults may serve as asymptomatic carrier.

Ascorbic acid present in the citrus food usually transform iron from its ferric (Fe 3+ ) to readily absorbable ferrous (Fe 2+ ) form, therefore, such citrus food must be avoided to minimize iron absorption. Owners should be advised so that they avoid giving the affected birds citrus fruits. Tanin, diets rich in fiber and phytate may be supplemented to the birds. To eliminate iron storage in the body periodic phlebotomy may be practiced (10% of body weight, once in a week). Iron chelating agent deferoxamine @ 100 mg/kg may be given PO/IM/SC once a day.",

In general it is thought that the syndrome is associated with abnormal protein metabolism, chronic debilitating diseases like avian tuberculosis, inflammations or tumours which may trigger a strong elevation in serum of serum amyloid A (apoSAA), an important acute phase reactant and the AA precursor protein. This precursor protein is necessary for amyloid AA type development and certain amino acid substitutions may facilitate amyloidogenicity for unstable intermediate protein conformations required for the whole process. Other favouring factors include-amyloid-enhancing factor, an altered basement membrane protein and the presence of certain inorganic ions such as calcium and sulphate. Recent studies have suggested that vaccination may also be a triggering factor for induction of amyloidosis in commercial birds. In general it is thought that amyloid may be of primary origin where no triggering or inciting cause can be identified or it may be secondary to prolong infection with a persistent antigenic stimulation. In case of ducks persistent stress is generally thought as an inciting factor for amyloidosis. Amyloid arthropathy was reported with Enterococcus faecalis and Mycoplasma synoviae infection. Some degree of genetic predisposition too was reported to be associated with amyloidosis.",

Among different visceral organs, liver, spleen and kidneys undergo characteristic changes like extensive enlargement, loss of lobules with rounded margins and pale discoloration (Fig. 3.23 ). Organs like proventriculus, large intestine, heart, gonads and endocrine organs are less affected. In case of ducks, swelling of feet and legs is very common with oedema. In few instances the affected ducks develop enlargement of ventral abdomen with ascites. This is probably due to circulatory collapse associated with hepatic amyloidosis. In such cases liver is usually enlarged and friable. It becomes brown to tan coloured. In chickens hepatic amyloidosis causes decreased egg production and sudden mortality due to ruptures of liver and haemorrhage. In amyloid arthropathy, the joints are swollen and painful and the affected birds show lameness and they are disinclined to move. Synovial fluid is thick and contains several yellow to green coloured deposits. ",
