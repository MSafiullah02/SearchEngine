A recent histopathological study of our group, evaluating the status of peripheral lymph nodes, spleen and MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) in 17 Iberian lynxes necropsied between the years 1998 and 2003, has reported a generalized immune depletion in these animals, apparently not related to infectious agents or malnutrition (Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006).",

We postulate that the Iberian lynx may be genetically prone to the disease, which could be enhanced by inbreeding and also may have a connection with an immune-mediated systemic disease. Future studies are necessary. Nevertheless, none of the animals are known to have died from chronic renal failure yet, though the results indicate that it may be widely extended, considering that the remaining population is of less than 200 individuals. Because of the critical state of this endangered species, signs of progression of this disease should be watched for, especially in the wild population.",
