The main causes of NOFH is blood circulation obstacle of the femoral head, however incentives to the NOFH pathogenesis are complex. Some studies indicated that steroid, which extensively used in various disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, is an important inducer for occurrence of NOFH [2]. However, the mechanism underlying steroid-induced NOFH remains to be elaborated.",

            "text": "Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding regulatory RNAs of about 19\u201322 nucleotides. They function as translational inhibitor or mRNA degradation promoter by binding to the 3\u2032untranslated region of their target mRNAs [3]. Recently, the biological roles of miRNA are under intense investigation, and their dysfunction has been considered to be extensively involved in the pathogenesis of numerous types of disease, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, lymphocytic leukemia as well as orthopaedics diseases [4], [5], [6]. Therefore, miRNA may play an important roles in the occurrence and development of various types of disease and may function as a novel biomarker and tool for clinical therapy. Currently, abnormal miRNA expression has been shown to play an important role in development of bone dysfunction. Currently, the best studied miRNAs that are involved in differentiation of osteoclasts are miR-21, miR-155 and miR-223 [7], [8], [9]. Studies by Zhang et al. established that at least 11 different miRNAs (i.e., miR-23a, miR-30c, miR-34c, miR-133a, miR-135a, miR-137, miR-204, miR-205, miR-217, miR-218, and miR-338) contributed to control osteoblast differentiation [10] and are expressed to different degrees in both osteogenic and non-osteogenic cells. miR-210 is intensely expressed in osteonecrosis, and was speculated to play a role in osteonecrosis pathogenesis [11]. Dysfunction of miR-17-5p is demonstrated to contribute to NOFH pathogenesis [12]. Adiponectin, considering as a serum biomarker for NOFH [13], is significantly associated with the presence of NOFH and also has been proved to regulated by mi-378, miR-221 and miR-423-5p [14]. Yuan et al. have identified thousands of upregulations such as miR-21, miR-17, and miR-92a, whereas others tended to downregulation, such as miR-205 and miR-145, in reparative interface of the femoral head with osteonecrosis by using high-throughput techniques-gene chip [15]. Notably, evidence increasingly shows serum miRNAs differential expression might be a marker for disease diagnosis. Although about 1000 miRNAs have been estimated in human, previous studies have only screened few miRNA expression in NOFH patients. Given this, it is necessary to screen NOFH with larger collections of miRNAs by gene chip.",

Due to complexity of pathogenesis, the therapeutic method has been always explored. Notably, the therapeutic trials to regulate the endogenous miRNAs related to diseases provide the potential of therapeutical targeting. Presently, the obstacle is the determination of the target miRNA. In this study, by screening with miRNA microchip, we found 9 prominent miRNAs (miR-378, miR-147, miR-130a-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-592, miR-423-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-145) with increased levels and three prominent miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, miR-484, miR-99a-5p) with decline levels in the serum of hormone-NOFH patients vs. healthy control. Based on this result, we test this differential miRNAs expression by qRT-PCR, and found out one upregulated miRNA (miR-423-5p) expression and one downregulated miRNA (miR-10a-5p) expression. Moreover, in NOFH patients, there is significant association between the serum miR-423-5p level and an important known diagnostic parameters (Index of FHC) as well as serum mark for NOFH (adiponectin). The diagnostic implications of adiponectin was demonstrated in Shuai et al. study performed in NOFH patients [13].",

As a key controller for epigenetic regulating genes, miRNAs are revealed to be important regulator for bone resorbing activity mediated by osteoclasts, as well as osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. For example, miR-378 was shown to directly upregulate bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression that is essential for osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal progenitor cells [17]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a key cytokine regulator of bone and mediates inflammatory bone loss, however, it-induced osteoblasts apoptosis was attenuated by miR-23a [18]. miR-204 attenuated osteoblast differentiation by directly targeting Runx2 in MSCs [19]. we reveal miR-34a as a key osteoclast suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche by inhibiting transforming growth factor-\u03b2-induced factor 2 (Tgif2) that is significant for bone resorption.",

Given this, we combined miRNA microchip assay and qRT-PCR in NOFH serum and attempt to find out changed levels of specific miRNAs in circulation of NOFH. The results of our study are consistent with this notion, showing that increased level of miR-423-5p and decreased level of miR-10a-5p in hormone-NOFH patients may be used as markers for NOFH diagnosis. Currently, although miRNAs has been demonstrated to be correlated with bone tissue homeostasis, the understanding of the clinical impact of miRNAs in NOFH patients is still in its infancy. In a recently published study, Jia et al. proved that dysfunction of miR-17-5p is contribute to NOFH pathogenesis [12]. Thus we using Spearman correlation assay to test whether exist a association between circulating miRNAs and hormone-NOFH clinical parameters. From the data, we confirmed that upregulated miR-423-5p has close relevance to diagnostic parameters (Index of FHC) that commonly appears in end-stage disease.",

Adiponectin is a collagen-like cytokine and commonly found in human serum with a range of 5\u201330 \u03bcg/mL [23]. Adiponectin possesses anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties and can influence lipid metabolism [24]. Abnormal lipid metabolism and bone marrow fat cell hypertrophy/proliferation play important roles in NOFH. Moreover, recent studies have also implicated adiponectin in the regulation of bone metabolism [25]. Oshima et al. reported that adiponectin could increase bone mass by suppressing osteoclastogenesis and activating osteoblastogenesis [26]. Shinoda et al. suggested distinct adiponectin actions on bone formation [27]. With regard to the important role of adiponectin in NOFH pathogenesis, Shuai et al. proved that low adiponectin level is significantly associated with the presence of NOFH and adiponectin may act as a biomarker for NOFH diagnosis. Our data showed that there is a strong negative association between miR-423-5p concentration and adiponectin level in hormone-NTFH patients.",
