Use of primary care data could help identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform patient management, public health measures, and more personalised advice to patient groups.5\n",

We found no relevant studies. Hospital-based studies have reported increasing age, male sex, and certain comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, to be associated with more severe COVID-19 disease. Whether these risk factors apply to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary care is unclear.\nAdded value of this study\nWe did a cross-sectional study of patients with a SARS-CoV-2 test code result in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre network between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We observed 587 patients with positive results and 3215 with negative results. Since we have sociodemographic and clinical data on patients in our sample, we could assess risk factors for a positive SARS-CoV-2 result, adjusted for potential confounding variables. Increasing age, male sex, population density, more deprived areas, and black ethnicity were associated with an increased risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Chronic kidney disease and obesity were the only clinical factors associated with a positive test. Current smokers had lower odds of a positive test. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to investigate risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the community.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur findings suggest some risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in this primary care study are similar to those associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, with men and people older than 40 years at increased risk. Research is needed into the effect of chronic conditions on the risk of infection and disease severity, ethnic variations in COVID-19 incidence, and the risk to smokers.\n",

These data allow estimation of household size,15 deprivation level, and rural\u2013urban classification.16 Since the last week of January, 2020, Research and Surveillance Centre practices have submitted nasopharyngeal swabs to Public Health England for SARS-CoV-2 testing from patients presenting with symptoms of influenza or respiratory infections. We included tests done through Public Health England surveillance, contact tracing, and routine UK National Health Service (NHS) primary and secondary care services. Although Public Health England surveillance testing has continued largely unchanged throughout the study period, NHS testing initially focused on people who travelled to high-risk countries or close contact tracing, but it has more recently focused on hospital testing and testing of health-care workers.",

We found that chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Both chronic kidney disease and obesity have been associated with increased risk of other respiratory infections.39, 40, 41 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended treatments for chronic kidney disease and have been postulated to impact SARS-CoV-2 host-cell interactions.42 However observational evidence does not support this effect,43, 44, 45 and further analyses to investigate the relationship between medications, chronic illnesses, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.",

            "text": "Previous studies have reported that smoking is associated with increased risk of intensive care unit admission or death among people with COVID-19.46 However, several studies reported a low prevalence of smoking among people with COVID-19. A Chinese study found that only 137 (12\u00b76%) of 1085 patients with COVID-19 were current smokers, compared with 27\u00b77% of Chinese adults,47 and an analysis of cases by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only 96 (1\u00b73%) of 7162 COVID-19 cases were active smokers, compared with 13\u00b77% in the general US population.48 These studies could be biased by confounding and by difficulties in accurately identifying current smokers among patients unwell with COVID-19. We found that active smoking was associated with lower odds of having a positive test result. There are several plausible reasons for this result. Active smoking might affect nasopharyngeal viral load and therefore affect RT-PCR test sensitivity, rather than protecting against actual infection, although this effect is not known to occur with influenza RT-PCR testing.49 Alternatively, as patients with symptoms are more likely to have been tested and included in our analysis, selection bias could affect this result.50 Smokers are more likely to have a cough, meaning they might also be more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 than non-smokers, even if they are SARS-CoV-2 negative. This more frequent testing could increase the proportion of smokers with negative SARS-CoV-2 results in our sample, which would bias our results. However, the proportion of smokers in our study was low. Furthermore, ex-smokers and people with chronic lung disease would also be expected to cough more, but these groups did not have higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Therefore, the relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection merits further investigation. Nicotine might downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors,51 which are used by SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry, although studies have found increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 lung expression among smokers and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.52, 53 Our findings should not be used to conclude that smoking prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, or to encourage ongoing smoking, particularly given the well documented harms to overall health from smoking, the potential for smoking to increase COVID-19 disease severity,46 and the possible alternative explanations for these findings.",

We acknowledge that ethnicity, for example, might not be missing at random.

If certain groups (eg, men, people in deprived areas, non-smokers, and black people) are only likely to present or be tested when more severely unwell, those who were tested could be more likely to be positive for COVID-19. Conversely, groups with lower thresholds for presentation might be tested with less severe symptoms, and therefore be more likely to test negative. It was not possible to assess the effects of thresholds for presentation and changes in testing guidelines in this analysis. Population-based surveys should ensure consistent levels of testing across subgroups as far as possible to reduce the risk of selection bias.",
