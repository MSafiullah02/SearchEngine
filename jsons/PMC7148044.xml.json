            "text": "Army ANT is an experimental workbench, built as a centralized codebase for research work in entity-oriented search. Over the years, there have been several experimental frameworks in information retrieval. Some of the most notable include the Lemur Project [1], Terrier [10] and, more recently, Nordlys [8], which is also focused on entity-oriented search. Army ANT was created as a structured framework for testing novel retrieval approaches in a comprehensive manner, even when potentially deviating from traditional paradigms. This required a flexible structure, that we developed by iteratively satisfying the requirements of multiple engine implementations for representing and retrieving combined data [4, Definition 2.3]. An important step in research, that we also motivate and support through our framework, is the continuous documentation of models and collections, which is fundamental for reproducibility, but also useful to advance research, by exploring, learning and building on previous approaches.",

Finally, we can see that a query is defined as a task and a sequence of keywords, and that results can be based on documents, entities, and their relations. Each component may have a command line icon, as well as a web interface icon, showing how it is available to the user.\n\n\n\n",

Figure 2 illustrates a run for the topics and qrels of the INEX Ad Hoc track, based on the hypergraph-of-entity and the random walk score, configuring values for four parameters. Figure 4 shows the preview dialog for exporting a selection of effectiveness metrics, for all runs.

It promotes reusability by separating collection reading from indexing and by structuring the process of implementing new representation and retrieval models with minimal constraints. One of the biggest strengths of Army ANT is its web interface, where researchers can demo their search engine, as well as explore, understand and analyze several of its facets, either tracing the ranking process for particular queries or visualizing the score components for those same queries. At the same time, we also provide a way for researchers to document their models and collections, using the learn mode to transfer knowledge to other researchers or even to students in a classroom.",
