The first stage is the outbreak period (December 31, 2019 to February 29, 2020), which entailed the period from the first detection of cases to the peak of the epidemic which saw a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases, and to the time when the growth rate slowed down to less than 200 new confirmed cases per day. In the second stage, which lasted from March 1, 2020 to March 21, 2020, the number of existing cases in most Chinese provinces was reduced to less than 10, respectively, whilst the number of newly confirmed cases in Wuhan, Hubei province, the worst-hit city, was slowly approaching zero. It was during this stage-more specifically on the March 4-that foreign imported cases to appear.",

Therefore, the conundrum regarding the control over overseas imported cases as well as the prevention of a second epidemic outbreak that is fast approaching is a problem that China needs to pay special attention to, especially after the first second-generation case imported from abroad had appeared.

Countries such as the United States (42,164 cases), Spain (33,089 cases), Germany (29,212 cases), and France (19,615 cases) have seen an explosive increase in confirmed cases, with the rate of growth showing no hint of slowing down.",

As of March 24, 2020, there were 427 imported cases and 3 second-generation cases originated from imported cases, one each in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China). It shows that China needs to pay more attention to the control of imported cases and reflect on the measures previously taken against imported cases. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe and America, many overseas Chinese or ethnic Chinese had chosen to return to China where the epidemic had remained under control, many of whom were themselves COVID-19 patients without realizing that they had been infected. As a result, imported cases from outside of China appeared in early March and began to increase sharply in mid-March (Figure 1B). China is now facing increasing pressure in the face of import cases from overseas, especially in cities that a are international travel hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. On the onset of this surge in the number of overseas patients, the operational capacity of airports with high volume of international flights",
