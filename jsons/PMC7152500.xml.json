Epidemiologic criteria include travel (including transit in an airport) within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area with current or previously documented or suspected community transmission of SARS or close contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms with a person known or suspected to have SARS.

During the neonatal period, type 2, and to a lesser extent type 1 causes encephalitis because of the vertical transmission of the virus.49 In contrast, in older children and adults, most HSV encephalitis is caused by type 1. HSV 2, however, can cause benign aseptic meningitis in association with primary and recurrent genital infections.50 Other members of the herpesvirus family (CMV, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], varicella-zoster virus [VZV], and HHV-6) can also cause aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, though they are less common. CMV encephalitis occurs mostly in immunosuppressed individuals but may occasionally appear in otherwise healthy individuals.51, 52 EBV aseptic meningitis and encephalitis presents with or without the classic findings of infectious mononucleosis.53 Acute cerebellar ataxia is a common and usually benign complication of chickenpox. VZV encephalitis can sometimes occur in immunocompetent individuals,54, 55 but more frequently occurs in immunocompromised individuals following days, weeks, or months after varicella or zoster. Zoster encephalitis can be complicated by small or large vessel vasculitis (granulomatous arteritis), which carries the potentially serious consequences of infarction.54, 56 HHV-6 has only rarely been reported to cause encephalitis in healthy children during primary infection,57 whereas it appears to be a more common problem for immunosuppressed patients, such as those receiving stem cell transplants.58, 126\n",

Most individuals infected with the West Nile virus are symptom free or experience flulike illness; however, older individuals and those with underlying immune deficiency can experience encephalitis that may result in death.

Travel or residence in areas where arboviruses are endemic during the appropriate season for arthropod transmission (typically summer months) and a history or evidence of insect bites should raise suspicion for arboviruses. Seasonality also plays a role in enteroviral diseases because in temperate climates enteroviruses are more prevalent during summer and fall months. History of a mother with recent symptoms consistent with viral illness (fever, sore throat, gastroenteritis, rash) should raise suspicion of enterovirus in a neonate with encephalitis or sepsislike illness. VZV encephalitis and myelitis typically follow chickenpox or zoster by weeks to months and commonly occur in older individuals or those with immunosuppression, such as transplant recipients.73 VZV encephalitis may be complicated by CNS vasculopathy and resulting infarctions.

The presence of HBsAg in serum indicates active HBV replication and is present in acute and chronic HBV infection. Because of the destruction of actively infected hepatocytes, HBsAg may be absent in FHF, and the only marker of acute HBV infection may be anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBcAb) (anti-HBV core) IgM antibodies. Hepatitis B DNA can also be detected in serum and liver tissue by PCR. Absence of HBsAg or HBV-DNA in the serum does not rule out HBV as the cause of FHF because HBV DNA has been shown in liver tissue of patients with non-A and non-B FHF in whom serologic markers did not suggest HBV infection.82 Hepatitis D, a hepatotropic virus that causes infection only in the presence of active hepatitis B infection, should be looked for in patients with acute HBV hepatitis because coinfection or superinfection with HDV may result in more severe disease.83 Hepatitis D coinfection can be determined with anti-HDV antibodies or HDV-RNA in serum.84\n",
