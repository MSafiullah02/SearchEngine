A recovery-orientation promotes whole health and focuses on self-directed care as individuals integrate into their communities (Gates and Akabas 2007). A recovery-orientation has prompted the rise of peer support as a core practice in behavioral healthcare (Chinman et al. 2014; Daniels et al. 2016; Gates and Akabas 2007). Many terms are used to describe individuals who provide peer support; this manuscript will use Peer Support Specialists (PSS).",

            "text": "Peer support is different from other forms of help provided by traditional behavioral health workers (Repper and Carter 2011). Peer support is a form of mutual aid provided by individuals, often certified, although not licensed, who are in recovery from mental illness and/or substance use. Peer support is based on mutuality, empowerment, hope and advocacy, and can be provided throughout treatment to facilitate long-term recovery and resiliency (Chinman et al. 2014; Gates and Akabas 2007). It involves giving and receiving help based on a shared understanding of what is helpful between people in similar situations (Soloman 2004; Mead et al. 2001). Respect, reciprocal relationships, empowerment, and shared responsibility are important concepts and practices in peer support (Repper and Carter 2011). PSS use their lived experiences\u2014not professional expertise\u2014to help individuals manage their mental illness, engage in treatment, and establish a fulfilling life (Chinman et al. 2014). PSS are uniquely positioned to instill hope through self-disclosure, to model self-care of mental illness, and to develop relationships based on trust, acceptance, and empathy (Davidson et al. 2012; Repper and Carter 2011). Research has shown that, when compared to traditional behavioral health services, people who engage in peer support, experience improved outcomes across various areas of health and wellbeing (Davidson et al. 2012; Chinman et al. 2014; Gates and Akabas 2007; Hutchinson et al. 2006; Repper and Carter 2011).",

PSS work in a variety of settings including inpatient and outpatient facilities, day treatment programs, hospice, respite, rehabilitation centers, and government organizations (Chinman et al. 2014). PSS can serve in a variety of roles, such as advocacy, navigation, outreach, case management, developing and facilitating treatment services/activities, mentoring, supervision, training, administration, and education (Salzer et al. 2010). PSS can also serve in a variety of settings including emergency rooms, hospitals, jails, prisons, state psychiatric hospitals (Cronise et al. 2016; Salzer et al. 2010, Migdole et al. 2011). A peer-run is a program that unlike traditional treatment models, is more focused on socialization, self-directed support, empowerment and hope (Swarbrick et al. 2009).",

PSS also benefit from increased income, increased sense of self-efficacy, and opportunities for skill development, socio-economic mobility, and career advancement (Gates and Akabas 2007; Hutchinson et al. 2006; Repper and Carter 2011). Self-efficacy is an important element in successful leadership. It is the perception that one is capable to meet the demands of a specific task (McCormick et al. 2002). It is this concept that influences leadership behaviors such as goal setting, decision-making, and problem solving. Literature on self-efficacy has demonstrated the causal relationship between self-efficacy and leadership success. Agency leadership has a great deal of influence in developing an individual\u2019s self-efficacy. Agency leaders can support increased self-efficacy by giving their supervisory staff challenging opportunities, modeling successful skills and strategies, and providing thoughtful feedback and encouragement (McCormick et al. 2002).",

I'm all about God and church and stuff like that.\u201d Another participant characterized their leadership as divinely inspired: \u201cMy higher power, which is God and Jesus Christ\u2026.I realized at that point in time that everything that I'd done in the past was preparing me for this position.\u201d",

For these participants, personal experiences in receiving and providing direct communication to others often creates an awareness of the importance of such communication. Experience in group therapy, individual therapy, and well-structured 12-step meetings provide unique but consistent exposure to direct communication, often about one\u2019s own shortcomings, sobriety status, symptom status, and substance use. As such, these emerging leaders may have a sense of comfort in these sorts of communications.

Dual relationships, where the peer professional has more than one relationship with clients or colleagues (Reamer 2003), are something the peer leader will inevitably have to manage. For the individual, they may decide to maintain their friendships, and for others it is important to impose a personal policy of no friendships in the workplace. What is important is that new leaders have the ability to discern when to be supportive, and when to refer their staff to outside support. It is a delicate balance when trying to maintain the essence of peer support and mutuality. Agencies developing PSS leaders may wish to consider creating opportunities for emerging leaders to have on-going conversations around supervision and boundaries. Within larger agencies, physically re-assigning leaders to new locations where they have not previously worked as a PSS may be an option to consider in certain circumstances. Additionally, peer supervisors are important for early career peer professionals and peer support teams who need guidance and mentorship through the lens of peer support and recovery principles.",

            "text": "One of the more unique aspects of employees with lived experience is a robust presence of spirituality that the employee assigns as their reason for working as a PSS. As noted by Deegan (2004), recovery from mental illness is in part a spiritual experience. For individuals exposed to 12-step recovery programs, spirituality and a calling to help are central themes and concepts. Culminating with the 11th and 12th step acknowledgement of a \u2018spiritual awakening\u2019, and a commitment to spread the word of recovery, becomes a call to action for many individuals to enter helping professions such as peer support. This spiritual element has important practice implications for both PSS leaders but also agencies developing PSS leaders. For leaders, developing a spiritual foundation is an intrapersonal exploration that can enhance emotional intelligence (Bracket et al. 2011; Serrat 2017) which are an important set of soft skills that are highly coveted in today\u2019s leaders. Incorporating a spiritual foundation while transitioning to a leadership role, is a critical time that may be supported by supervisors and mentors of emerging PSS leaders. In particular, PSS may need structed time to discuss how to incorporate spirituality as a foundation to their values, beliefs, and sense of self, without bringing spirituality/religion as a primary feature in their professional role.",

The recent release of practice-guidelines for peer specialists and supervisors by the The International Association of Peer Supporters (iNAPS 2019) provides a framework for peer specialist-supervisors, closely aligning with some of the peer leadership qualities addressed by the current study. Future research should elaborate upon the \u2018hard skills\u2019 or technical-administrative skills and competencies that emerging peer supporter leaders are called upon to develop (Zimmerman-Oster and Burkhardt 2000). Skills such as reading financial ledgers, budgeting, project management, proposal development, and data driven decision-making are a few of the universal leadership skills that emerging PSS leaders may need to acquire. Future research should assess the competency and efficacy of PSS leaders in these technical areas. Integrating high priority skill training into existing PSS academies and other educational opportunities for PSS workers could advance the development and achievement of this segment of the workforce.",
