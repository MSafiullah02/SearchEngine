It noted, \u201cCompared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort\u201d [1]. We would like to share observations from our setting, Thailand, where the disease occurred after its first appearance in China [2]. In Thailand, at present (14 March 2020), there are 82 COVID-19 patients including 3 children (of these, 2 are under treatment and 1 has recovered). We only observed mild symptoms, and there were no significant findings on radiography and computed tomography of the chest. All our pediatric cases were detected early by screening programmes for at-risk individuals, which may explain the mild symptoms. Therefore, our observations add to those communicated by Li et al. [1].",
