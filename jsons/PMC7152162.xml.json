British forces gave Native Americans blankets from a smallpox hospital in an attempt to affect the balance of power in the Ohio River Valley in the eighteenth century.2 In addition to their well-described use of chemical weapons, Axis forces purportedly infected livestock with anthrax and glanders to weaken Allied supply initiatives during World War I. Perhaps the most egregious example of biological warfare involved the Japanese program in occupied Manchuria from 1932 to 1945. Based on survivor accounts and confessions of Japanese participants, thousands of prisoners were murdered in experiments using a variety of virulent pathogens at Unit 731, the code name for a notorious Japanese biological weapons facility.3\n",

Current efforts continue as countermeasures against biological weapons. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of Biological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BWC) was ratified in 1972, formally banning the development or use of biological weapons, and assigning enforcement responsibility to the United Nations.2 Unfortunately, the BWC has not been effective in its stated goals; multiple signatories have violated the terms and spirit of the agreement. The accidental release of aerosolized anthrax spores from a biological weapons plant in the Soviet Union in 1979, with at least 68 human deaths from inhalational anthrax reported downwind, was proven years later to have occurred in the context of offensive weapons production.",

More recently, UN weapons-inspector findings of significant quantities of weaponized biological compounds in Iraq during the Gulf War and the subsequent aftermath has served as sentinel warnings of a shift in terrorism trends.

A World Health Organization (WHO) model based on the hypothetical effects of the intentional release of 50 kg of aerosolized anthrax spores upwind from a population center of 500,000 (analogous to that of metropolitan Providence, RI) estimated that the agent would disseminate in excess of 20 km downwind and that nearly 200,000 people would be killed or injured by the event.5 Biological weapons possess unique properties among WMDs. By definition, biological agents are associated with a clinical latency period of days to weeks, in most cases, during which time early detection is quite difficult with currently available technology. Yet, early detection is critical because specific antimicrobial therapy and vaccines are available for the treatment and prevention of illness caused by certain biological weapons. Casualties from other forms of WMDs can generally only be treated by decontamination (with antidotes available for only some types), trauma mitigation, and supportive care. Additionally, the possibility of a biological attack provokes fear and anxiety\u2014\u201cterror\u201d\u2014disproportionate to that seen with other threats, given their often invisible nature.",

The anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001 evoked significant anxiety and diverted resources from other critical public health activities despite the limited number of casualties.

However, revelations have suggested that some agents may be available on the worldwide black market and in other illicit settings, thus obviating the need for the extensive production process.6 Although traditionally thought to require an efficient delivery mode, recent events, including the 2001 United States anthrax attacks, demonstrated the devastating results that can be achieved with relatively primitive delivery methods (e.g., high-speed mail-sorting equipment and mailed letters).",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has prioritized biological-agent threats based on the aforementioned characteristics, and this has influenced current preparation strategies (Table 79-2\n).7 Category A agents, considered the highest priority, are associated with high mortality and the greatest potential for major effects on the public health. Category B agents are considered \u201cincapacitating\u201d because of their potential for moderate morbidity but relatively low mortality.

Absent of advance warning or specific intelligence information, clinical illness will likely manifest before the circumstances of a release event are known.

This is in contrast to the more familiar scenarios in which police, firefighters, paramedics, and other emergency services personnel are deployed to the scene of an attack with conventional weaponry or a natural disaster. Physicians and other health care workers must therefore maintain a high index of suspicion of bioterrorism, and recognize suggestive epidemiologic clues and clinical features to enhance early recognition and guide initial management of casualties.

            "text": "Unfortunately, early recognition is hampered for multiple reasons. As previously discussed, it is likely that the circumstances of any event will only be known in retrospect. Therefore responders may be unable to discern the extent of exposure immediately. Also, terrorists have a nearly unlimited number of targets in most open democratic societies, and it is unrealistic to expect any governing body without detailed intelligence of an impending attack to secure an entire population at all times. Certain sites, such as government institutions, historic landmarks, or large public gatherings, may be predictable targets; however, other facilities may fall victim to bioterrorism. In fact, government data support that businesses and other economic concerns were the main targets of global terrorism during the period from 1996 to 2002.9 Metropolitan areas are traditionally considered especially vulnerable given the dense populations and already existing public gathering areas such as subways and office buildings. Because of the expansion of suburbs and the commuter lifestyle, as well as the clinical latency period between exposure and symptoms, casualties of bioterrorism are likely to present for medical attention in diverse locations and at varying times after a common exposure. An event in New York City on a Wednesday morning may result in clinically ill persons presenting over the ensuing weekend to a variety of emergency departments within a 60-mile radius. Finally, current modes of transportation ensure that there will be affected persons thousands of miles away, at both national and international locations, related to a single common exposure. This adds layers of complexity to an already complicated management strategy and illustrates the critical importance of surveillance and real-time communication in the response to suspected bioterrorism.",

If allowed to progress beyond the early stages, many of these illnesses deteriorate quite rapidly, and treatment may be significantly more difficult. Most of the diseases caused by agents of bioterrorism are rarely, if ever, seen in modern first-world clinical practice. Physicians are likely to be inexperienced with their clinical presentation and be less aware of alarming symptomatic constellations. Additionally, these agents by definition will have been manipulated in a laboratory and may not present with the classic clinical features of naturally occurring infection.

This approach will also lead to the recognition of outbreaks of naturally occurring disease or emerging pathogens. The recognition of a single case of a rare or nonendemic infection, in the absence of a travel history or other potential natural exposure, should raise the suspicion of bioterrorism. Finally, unusual patterns of disease, such as concurrent illness in human and animal populations should raise suspicions of bioterrorism or another form of emerging infection.

Details of the microbiology and pathogenesis of anthrax are found in Chapter 124. In nature, anthrax is a zoonotic disease of herbivores that is prevalent in many geographic regions; sporadic human disease results from environmental or occupational contact with endospore-contaminated animal products.14 The cutaneous form of anthrax is the most common presentation; gastrointestinal and inhalational forms are exceedingly rare in naturally acquired disease. An additional form, injectional anthrax, represents a potentially lethal, deep soft-tissue infection that has been well described in injection heroin users in several western European countries.14a Cutaneous anthrax occurred regularly in the first half of the twentieth century in association with contaminated hides and wools used in the garment industry, but it is uncommonly seen in current-day industrialized countries because of importation restrictions. The last-known fatal case of naturally occurring inhalational anthrax in the United States occurred in 1976, when an individual was exposed to imported wool from Pakistan.15 Case reports of naturally occurring anthrax do occur within the United States, although they are rare.16 It has been previously hypothesized that large-scale bioterrorism with anthrax would involve aerosolized endospores with resultant inhalational disease, but the 2001 attacks in the United States illustrate the difficulties in predicting modes and outcomes in bioterrorism. These attacks were on a relatively small scale, and nearly 40% of the confirmed cases were of the cutaneous variety.17 The serious morbidity and mortality of anthrax is instead related to inhalational disease, as was the case in the Sverdlovsk outbreak in 1979. As a result, planning for larger-scale events with aerosolized agent is warranted given the high-mortality cost of an exposure to this more weaponized form of anthrax.",

Although there is much overlap between the clinical manifestations noted previously and those observed during the recent outbreak, data that are more detailed are available from the recent U.S. experience. There were 11 confirmed persons with inhalational anthrax, 5 (45%) of whom died. This contrasts with a case-fatality rate of greater than 85% reported from Sverdlovsk with an estimated 100 deaths. The reliability of reported data from this outbreak is questionable, given Soviet documentation, but a majority of victims were located downwind of the ill-fated weapons plant.15,\n18 Patients almost on average present of 3.3 days after symptom onset with fevers, chills, malaise, myalgias, nonproductive cough, chest discomfort, dyspnea, nausea or vomiting, tachycardia, peripheral neutrophilia, and liver enzyme elevations.11,\n19,\n20 Many of these findings are nondiagnostic, and they overlap considerably with those of influenza and other common viral respiratory tract infections. Recently compiled data suggest that shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting are significantly more common in anthrax, whereas rhinorrhea is uncommonly seen in anthrax but noted in the majority of viral respiratory infections, an important clinical distinction.21 Other common clinical manifestations of inhalational anthrax include abdominal pain, headache, mental status abnormalities, and hypoxemia. Abnormalities on chest radiography appear to be universally present, although these may only be identified retrospectively in some cases. Pleural effusions are the most common abnormality, although radiographs may demonstrate patchy infiltrates, consolidation, and/or mediastinal adenopathy. The latter is thought to be an early indicator of disease, but computed tomography appears to provide greater sensitivity compared with chest radiographs for this finding.",

The diagnosis should also be considered in a single individual with a clinical illness consistent with anthrax exposure in the absence of another etiology. The early recognition and prompt treatment of inhalational anthrax is likely associated with a survival advantage.11 Therefore the emergency physician should promptly initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy if infection is clinically suspected. Combination parenteral therapy is appropriate in the ill person for a number of reasons: to cover the possibility of antimicrobial resistance, to target specific bacterial functions (e.g., the theoretical effect of clindamycin on toxin production), to ensure adequate drug penetration into the central nervous system, and perhaps to favorably affect survival.11 Drainage of pleural effusions is indicated to reduce toxin burden. Detailed therapeutic and post-exposure prophylaxis recommendations have been recently reviewed elsewhere.22a A monoclonal antibody targeted at the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin, raxibacumab, is available for the adjunctive treatment of systemic anthrax.14a In the future, it is likely that novel therapies such as toxin inhibitors or cell-specific receptor antagonists will be available to treat anthrax post exposure.23 Detailed therapeutic and postexposure prophylaxis recommendations for adults, children, and special groups have been recently reviewed elsewhere.15 With regard to postexposure prophylaxis, the Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed is effective for prevention of cutaneous anthrax in human clinical trials, as well as preventing inhalational disease after aerosol challenge in nonhuman primates.21 Current studies are investigating the efficacy of this vaccine when paired with antibiotics in the postexposure period. For preexposure prophylaxis, the vaccine is generally very safe, but it requires five doses over 18 months, with the need for annual boosting for ongoing preventative immunity.24 Preexposure use of the vaccine is currently limited to individuals at high risk for anthrax exposure, such as military personnel and specific laboratory workers. Although not currently available, additional research into second-generation anthrax vaccines is aimed to generate a more easily distributed means of mass prophylaxis following an anthrax exposure.25\n",

Multiple features make smallpox an attractive biological weapon and ensure that any reintroduction into human populations would be a global public health catastrophe: it is stable in aerosol form, has a low infective dose, is associated with up to a 30% case-fatality rate, and has a large vulnerable target population because civilian vaccination was terminated in 1972. Smallpox is also especially dangerous because secondary attack rates among unvaccinated close contacts are estimated at 37% to 88% and are only further amplified by the lack of vaccine-induced immunity and a lack of naturally circulating virus to induce low-level booster exposures.27 Because of the successful eradication, preexposure vaccination is currently limited to specific military and laboratory professionals.

Disease surveillance, diagnosis, infection control, antimicrobial therapy, postexposure prophylaxis, and mass preventative vaccinations are all important considerations when managing a bioterrorism event. For these reasons, physicians are likely first responders to bioterrorism and will be expected to be reliable sources of information for their patients, colleagues, and public health authorities.43\n",

As alluded to above, the clinical latency period between exposure to an agent and the manifestation of signs and symptoms is approximately days to weeks with most of the CDC category A, B, or C agents. Thus, early diagnoses of the first cases are likely to prove problematic and require heightened clinical vigilance, a difficult task considering a majority of these agents are rarely observed in the developed world.44 Even after initial victims have been diagnosed, communications among hospitals and other health care institutions on a local, regional, national, and international level will be essential to help define the epidemiology and identify possible exposure sources. Given the extent and ease of rapid individual movement within our globalized world, clinical presentations from a point-source biological attack could occur in widely disparate geographic locations. Additionally it is possible that a terrorist attack would be multifocal in any case, with components of WMDs paired with biological weapons for maximum effect. A fundamental and consistent epidemiologic approach using case definitions, case identification, surveillance, and real-time communications is necessary, whether the event is a malicious attack, emergent from nature, or of unknown etiology.45\n",

Although an active area of research, the development of field-ready and highly predictive rapid screening tests for many agents of bioterrorism has not yet progressed to the point at which such assays are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and available in a \u201cpoint-of-care\u201d format. Treatment and prevention issues such as the absence of effective therapies for many forms of viral hemorrhagic fevers, shortages in the availability of multivalent antitoxin for botulism, projected shortages in the availability of mechanical ventilators to manage a large-scale botulism attack, lack of human data regarding the use of antiviral agents in smallpox, and the unfavorable toxicity profiles of some currently available smallpox vaccines remain unresolved but active areas of research. Emerging molecular biology techniques capable of producing genetically altered pathogens with \u201cdesigner\u201d phenotypes including antimicrobial or vaccine resistance add additional layers of complexity to an already multifaceted problem. As was vividly illustrated in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic and previously well recognized when smallpox occurred with regularity, transmission of infection of potential bioterrorism agents within hospitals is common and difficult to control.46,\n21 Health care workers, our first line of defense against an attack using biological agents, remain at significant occupational risk.",

This will only serve to facilitate the initial containment and facilitate rapid disaster-protocol activation.
