            "text": "The severe acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) disease has been declared as the second pandemic disease of the twenty-century, after the A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009 (1) . COVID-19 is a complex human viral infectious disease caused by an RNA virus (genus Betacoronavirus), named SARS-CoV-2 due to its 82% similarity with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (2, 3) . This severe acute respiratory syndrome's common symptoms include: fever, dyspnoea, fatigue, dry cough, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (4) . The virus spreads mainly through person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or even through contaminated surfaces (4, 5) . Recent studies based on China showed an increased chance of in-hospital death associated with old age, male sex, and contemporary comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease) (6) (7) (8) . Currently there is no available vaccine or a specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, so the early diagnosis is fundamental to promptly treat the symptoms (9) . Furthermore, since infected patients with respiratory complications related to COVID-19 required hospitalizations in Intensive Care Units (ICU), this may be a crucial issue for the National Healthcare System's capacity (10) . The negative impact of this disease on the worldwide economy has been discussed and enormous socio-economic losses have been hypothesized, even more than the SARS epidemic (11) . Nevertheless, specific economic impact estimation is highly uncertain and seems to be full of gaps, and an accurate estimation could be impossible. All these factors make it difficult for policymakers to formulate an appropriate macroeconomic policy response (12, 13) . A global macroeconomic analysis demonstrates that even a contained outbreak could significantly impact the economy and greater investment in public health systems will be the only way to avoid economic disasters (14) . The dramatic evolution of COVID-19 resulted in a severe health scenario in China for the first 3 months of 2020 (15) . From 20th January the disease spread outside China with two cases in Thailand, one in Japan, and one in the Republic of Korea (16) . Five days later the first case was reported in French Republic. The first full-blown outbreak in Europe occurred on 22nd February in Italy (17, 18) and subsequently the disease spread all over the continent and worldwide with about one million cases as of 8th April, 2020 (19) . The total number of cases in Italy continues to increase, exceeding 139,000 people, and the number of people killed by COVID-19 (17, 669) outweighs the deaths recorded in China (3, 259) . Using the same data, in Italy \u223c5,200 beds in ICU (10) are available and 3,693 patients are already admitted in ICU (18) . The most affected Italian Region was Lombardy with 53,414 confirmed cases, 9,727 deaths, and 1,257 admitted in ICU (18) . Recent studies tried to provide the number of COVID-19 case estimations in different world areas (20) . The first official predictive model for the Italian disease spread was published a few days after the first disease occurrence (10) . This study assimilates the number of Italian cases increment to an exponential trend and correctly predicted more than 30,000 infectious and 4,000 hospital beds needed during the first 2 weeks of March 2020. The Italian Government put in place extraordinary measures, principally based on limiting contact to contain the virus spread, even before the WHO official declaration of pandemic status on 11th March 2020 (1). The national Decree-Law declared a \"lockdown\" of all commercial and retail activities, with an exception for basic necessities stores, and movement was limited to only for work activities, health reasons, and urgent needs (i.e., to buy groceries, care for the elderly, or reach one's own house) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Air and sea transport were subject to the same rule with specific involvement of Italian Islands Regions (Sardinia and Sicily). From 17th March, in order to strengthen the capacity of the Healthcare System to face the emergency, the Government identified funding to increase ICU beds and for the production of personal protective equipment. In addition, the Italian Ministry of Defense has activated an extraordinary procedure for the recruitment of biologists, physicists, chemists, military doctors, physicians, and nurses (26) . Following the National regulations, considering the particular condition of Sardinian island and the several problems related to potential patients' transport toward other regions, from 14th March 2020 Sardinian Region ordered the closure of air and sea passenger transport (27) . Transport routes will be available only for freight. Given the insulating conditions, the health check of passengers arriving by sea assumes strategic importance. Specific protocols have been put in place in the main Sardinian naval ports, aimed to control the COVID-19 spread (28) . After the first SARS-CoV-2 case reported on the 2nd March in the metropolitan area of Cagliari, few cases have been reported all over the island. The first declared outbreak in Sardinia dates back to 15th March in the north of the island (Sassari province) with 35 cases officially reported, when for the first time the intra-hospital contagion involved not only healthcare staff but also patients (28) . From that time, the disease spread all over the region (29, 30) . This study aimed to investigate the current COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Sardinia based on official reported data. Furthermore, a stochastic model has been applied to estimate the transmission parameters and establish the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive, recovered, and deceased people expected. The present analysis aims to be a valid instrument to help political leaders and health authorities to manage the disease in an island where, if the most appropriate health measures are taken, the epidemic could be more rapidly controlled.",

Despite being defined as the oldest civilization in Italy, in most of the Sardinian territory a modern and diversified economy coexists with a still intact natural ecosystem. Sardinia is one of the least populated regions of Italy (32) (69 inh./km\u00b2) and holds the record for the oldest population in Italy and one of the oldest all over the world (33) . The last population census performed by Statistic National Italian Institute (ISTAT) showed that Sardinian people have an average age (46.3 years) older than Italy's national level (44.9 years), and an elderly rate of 212% with respect to the Italian rate of 173% (34). During the last year, a total of 389,614 people aged \u226565 years were living in Sardinia, over a total population of 1,639,591 inhabitants. Most of the elderly population lives in Oristano province (elderly rate = 262%), while Sassari is the province with the lowest elderly rate in Sardinia (194.3%), however still higher than the national average (31) . Cagliari is the most populated province with about 780,000 people (including Sud Sardinia), followed by Sassari (500,000), Nuoro (208,000), and Oristano (197,000). Over the island, a total of 32 hospitals are present with a total of 486 ICU available for COVID-19 emergency (172 in the north and 314 in the south), as reported in the official Sardinian Region strategic plans against COVID-19 (35).

Patients reported as SARS-CoV-2 infected have been classified by way of exposure: \"From Italian Red Zone\" included subjects who arrived in Sardinia from high risk areas (North Italy); \"2nd contagious-Red Zone\" included subjects living in Sardinia who developed COVID-19 after contact with subjects who arrived from the Italian Red Zone; \"2nd contagious\" included subjects infected not directly by the Red Zone. Data related to 16th March-\u22128th April (2nd period) were collected by official sources and used to evaluate the current situation in Sardinia.

Since no vaccine or population immunity is available, the model accounts for only two outcomes: death or recovery. The all Sardinian population is assumed to be randomly distributed and closer; no births or unrelated deaths are considered. Applying the SIRD model (Figure 1 ), at any time t \u2265 0, the susceptible people S(t) moved to the infectious I(t) compartment when they become infected. After an infectious period, the subjects entered in status of recovered R(t) (successfully immunized) or D(t) disease-induced death. At any time, the overall population (N) is described as S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = N(t). The model simply keeps track of the number of individuals in each class and those who move from one class to another. The state variables change according to a system of differential equations:",

            "text": "As underlined by several studies, the main problem of these models is the approximation of the epidemiological parameters (i.e., \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, and R0), since the actual number of infected I (t) people is underestimated or even unknown (20) . Furthermore, it is essential to consider the possible confounding role of different disease control strategies by country, which can make a substantial difference in identifying the real number of infected patients (41) (42) (43) (44) . In a specific population where all individuals are susceptible to infection, R0 represents the average number of secondary cases generated from the introduction of a single infectious case during the infectiousness period. In order to avoid the problem related to R0 classical definition, which strictly depends on \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 rates, the calculation proposed by Anastassopoulou et al. (20) , has been applied, considering Sardinian reported cases from 22nd to 29th March 2020. Given the limited data on COVID-19 transmission parameters, and considering the recent incursion of the disease in Sardinia which does not allow for an accurate estimation of the recovered subjects (as the diagnostic assessment of the recovered people takes longer than the diagnostic assessment of infection), three methods have been compared to assess \u03b2 and \u03b4. First, bibliographic research using PubMed database has been carried out. The key words used alone or in combination were \"COVID-19, \" \"SARS-CoV-2, \" \"transmission rate, \" \"mortality rate, \" and \"SIR model.\" The research made available a range of data for each estimate (minimum, maximum, and \"most likely\" value), useful to perform the probability model (4-10, 15, 20, 41-44) . The beta-PERT distribution (45) has been used to generate the distribution that more closely resembles realistic probability distribution of \u03b2 and \u03b4. Monte-Carlo simulation has been applied based beta-PERT parameter estimation, with 50,000 iterations after a burn-in for convergence of 10,000 iterations. Estimations proposed by this method were equal to 0.116 (min-max = 0.089-0.230) and 0.0012 (min-max = 0.0007-0.0015) for recovery and death rate, respectively. Furthermore, the computation based on corresponding cumulative functions (20) have been applied for both parameters (\u03b2 = 0.164, 95% CI 0.041-0.187) and \u03b4 as 0.059 (95% CI 0.033-0.119). Finally, the rate re-calculation proposed by Baud et al. (44) has been applied on date from the 15th March in Sardinia, showing a recovery rate of 0.154 (95% CI 0.117-0.191) and a death rate of 0.001 (95% CI 0.0008-0.0012). Two scenarios have been simulated: beta-PERT estimation has been applied for the worst scenario while the re-calculated rates have been used to simulate the best scenario for COVID-19 in Sardinia, considering the Italian Government measures and assuming \u03b1 infection rate halved. For each scenario, the R0 has been estimated based on recovery rate (\u03b2) and fatality rate (\u03b4), as usual for SIRD models (36) . Giving \u03b2 and \u03b4, an infected rate (\u03b1) approximation can be described by g = \u03b1S \u2212 \u03b3 , where \u03b3 is the inverse of the mean recovery time in days [i.e., average time considered for infection resolution 14 days, \u03b3 = 1/14 (4)], thus \u03b1 becomes a function of the initial susceptible population. The S (t0) population has been The algorithm is run for 100,000 iterations with a burn-in of the first 70,000 iterations. In order to highlight the number of elderly that could be involved in COVID-19 spread in Sardinia, based on both scenarios estimated and region specific disease infectious rate (by age classes) calculated by Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (39), different scenarios have been simulated. Considering the lack of data and the absence of specific parameter estimations among elders, the same parameter values of general SIRD models have been used, projecting the specific rates on the estimated infected overall population. Supposing a number of infected subjects, the proportion of infected by age class has been estimated.",

During the time between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sardinia (2nd March) and the outbreak in Sassari (15th March), a total of 77 cases have been officially declared by Sardinian Region. For 68 subjects, data about exposure has been collected: 18 have become infected in the North of Italy (coming back from \"Red Zone\") or after direct contact with COVID-19 positive people from \"Red Zone, \" by out-hospital transmission. A total of 50 subjects contracted the disease by 2nd contagious exposure, not through direct contact with people from \"Red Zone, \" and by intra-hospital transmission (65% of the overall contagious). The intra-hospital contagious involved only medical staff until the 15th March when, for the first time, intra-hospital infection involved patients. From that time, the number of cases in Sassari province increased dramatically. On 8th April, data expressed as number of cases \u00d7 10.000 inhabitants, showed a rate of about 23 in Italy, 5.9 in Sardinia, 13.3 in Sassari, with lower rates having been recorded in the other provinces (Figure 2) . In Sardinia 975 subjects have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, of these 112 are recovered with symptoms, 31 are in ICU, and 59 have resulted in death. In Sassari the amount of cases increased 18 times from the first official outbreak to 8th April. As reported in Table 1 and considering the overall data, the number of asymptomatic patients is around 30% and the hospitals (or nursing homes) confirm their critical role as way of spreading contagions between patients (23% of the total).

            "text": "To date no COVID-19 risk assessment is available for Sardinia region, where the disease control could take advantage as it is an island. As underlined by several previous studies, the most difficult prediction to make is the number of infected patients at the time of the disease peak (10, 20, 48) . However, this prediction is of crucial importance to plan appropriate COVID-19 management programs and to calculate the time period at which additional health resources are needed. The present study partially contributes to fill the gaps identified by Bedford et al., based on the WHO national risk assessment about the need to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility and to estimate the reproductive number in different regions and countries (41) . Based on the COVID-19 Sardinian cases up to 15th March 2020 we estimated the worst and the best scenarios. As expected, changing the parameter estimation (i.e., mortality rate, death rate, and number of contact), the number of expected infected patients, recovered patients, and deceased subjects change drastically, as well as the peak date (20, 36) . Based on the parameters resulting from available bibliography, the peak of the disease seems to be early (3rd May 2020) compared to the peak assessed based on the Sardinian parameters re-calculated (21st May). At the same time, the number of infected patients changed from 130,000 to 11,500. It must be considered that it is not obvious, and it will be very unlikely to observe these estimated cases as the number of infected patients that will be officially reported. In fact, the asymptomatic subjects play a key role in disease transmission. As observed by Li et al. (46) Essentially, the authors support the measures applied in Italy and Sardinia to control the SARS-CoV-2 spread, which will certainly soon yield encouraging results. From early March, the Italian and Sardinian Governments made a great effort to limit as much as possible the amount of contact between people, therefore limiting the contagion. Several Chinese studies showed that the peak value persistently decreases by reducing contact rate, but may either delay or bring forward the peak by 6.5-9 days (min-max = 5-9). Since the isolation of people can significantly lower the peak and reduce the cumulative number of predicted reported cases, even in an elderly population (38) , the results of the present study can suggest that enforcing the restrictive measures can rapidly improve the situation. When the disease arrived in Sardinia, the restrictive measures were already in place, thus the peak of the disease could occur later than in the rest of Italy. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the particularly low population density of Sardinia (69 inh./km\u00b2) and that the 27% of elderly people (\u226565 years) live alone and isolated (34). Thus, the worst scenario could overestimate the number of cases, since the \u03b1 parameter is based on the average worldwide amount of contact. While in early stages of the epidemic most of the contagions were intrahospital, to date the spread of the disease in Sardinia seems to be occurring mostly in hospital and nursing homes (23-41% of total cases, depending on province) (39, 50) . Even if this is dramatic for the at risk categories, an appropriate isolation of these cases could drastically suppress the disease spread. This generates a borderline difference between Italy and Sardinia in the average age of the infected/deceased subjects, which hampered the use of national lethality rates in estimating regional lethality. In Sardinia the median age is 83 years old, while in Italy most of the people who died from Covid-19 were 80 years old (50, 51) .",

However, several authors consider a long-term disease spread, that may last up to the next 18 months. Given the worldwide economic and social difficulties in maintaining such a high level of restrictions, an adaptive policy needs to be considered: social distancing would only be applied after that confirmed cases admitted in ICU exceeds specific threshold, while this policy will be relaxed when ICU case incidence falls below the threshold. On the contrary, case-based policies of home isolation of symptomatic cases must persist (43) . Finally, different studies underline that healthcare staff in work environments with a high risk of infection experienced feelings of anxiety and extreme fatigue and that subjects in quarantine felt negative feelings such as anger and stress. For this reason, although the treatment of the critical infection consequences and the COVID-19 spread containment is the priority, the psychological impact cannot be underestimated and the possibility of offering psychological online support should be considered (52, 53) .",
