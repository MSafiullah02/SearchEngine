The clinical features and outcomes of the subjects are shown in Table 1. All individuals were sharing the same day\u2010care room on the ward. Two patients had bronchiolitis (Cases 1 and 7), five bronchitis (Cases 2\u20135 and 8), and one upper RTI (Case 6) based on the clinical symptoms and chest roentgenograms. Mean duration of exothermic reaction (>37.0\u00b0C) was 4 days (range 0\u20136). Wheezing and dyspnea were observed in only two subjects; coryza and productive cough were observed in all.
