For example, prior to the current outbreak of COVID-19, the platform\u2019s most popular emergency-related course, eProtect Ebola (offered in English and French), consisted primarily of users from Africa, Europe, and North America, with no South or Central American countries appearing in the top 20 for either language version of the course. This pattern reflected what was a general trend across the platform in the months preceding the launch of the introductory COVID-19 course; the platform\u2019s top 5 countries most commonly consisted of, in descending order, the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Nigeria, with only the presence of India breaking the aforementioned trend. As such, the launch of the introductory COVID-19 course has brought with it a change in the demographic of users on the platform, with a marked increase in traction from Central and South America.",

This is consistent with the at-risk group seeking reliable knowledge on the emerging respiratory disease.
