Among the structural proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal structures of the proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S protein is a critical target candidate for inhibitor screening or vaccine design against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be useful for further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided drug development and vaccine design. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases. 1, 2 Very recently, there have been thousands of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. These cases of pneumonia were found to be related to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, where local government agencies quickly adopted sanitation and disinfection measures. Now, it is known that these cases of pneumonia were caused by a novel betacoronavirus, that is, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Then, the genome sequence and amino acid sequences were originally released by several research groups from different countries. [13] [14] [15] The genome of the newly discovered CoV consists of a single, positivestranded RNA that is about 30k nucleotides long. The overall genome organization of the newly discovered CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses. The newly sequenced virus genome encodes the open reading frames (ORFs) common to all betacoronaviruses, containing ORF1ab that encodes several enzymatic proteins, the spike-surface glycoprotein (S protein), the small envelope protein (E protein), the matrix protein (M protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N protein), as well as several nonstructural accessory proteins. Currently, the specific primers and probes for detection 2019-nCoV were synthesized and fabricated against the genetic targets such as ORF1ab and N gene region. According to the gene sequencing data, Wu terrupted. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] It can be predicted that the research results of computational biology and bioinformatics will play an important role in the process of resistance to new coronavirus. 22, 23 Realization and prediction of these structural and nonstructural proteins from 2019-nCoV should be used by more scientific and technological workers, especially those engaged in drug research and development. Using the observed and achieved three-dimensional models of these structural and nonstructural proteins, the screening of potential drugs against 2019-nCoV could be carried out. In this study, using the amino acid sequences released on NCBI, we try to clarify the closest sequences and identify the most suitable template existed for homology modeling of several crucial proteins of 2019-nCoV. This study would be beneficial to the next drug screening research.",

Building a homology model comprises four main steps: identification of structural template(s), alignment of the target sequence and template structure(s), model-building, and model quality evaluation. Clustal Omega is the latest addition to the Clustal family. 34, 35 Clustal Omega is a multiple sequence alignment program that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profileprofile techniques to generate alignments between three or more sequences. It produces biologically meaningful multiple sequence alignments of divergent sequences. In this study, using three popular online tools, that is, BLAST, SWISS-MODEL, and Clustal Omega, we performed sequence alignment investigations on these 10 primary sequences of 2019-nCoV. Here, we summarized the main findings mentioned in this section on the structure prediction of the proteins encoded by ORF1ab using the homology modeling method in Table 1 Here, we explored the rationality and feasibility of the homology modeling of other proteins. According to BLAST search results, it is found that SARS spike glycoprotein is a good template for DONG ET AL. 2019-nCoV S protein is about 76%, and the query coverage rate is 95%; the homology of MERS S protein (PDB ID: 5X59) and 2019-nCoV S protein is about 34%, and the query coverage rate is 74% (see Figures S63 and S64 ). Using SWISS-MODEL, 6ACD_C can be used as a potential template for modeling 2019-nCoV S protein (see Figure S65 ). Then, the homology modeling of S protein could be realized (see Figure S66 ). Next, we try to perform the homology modeling of ORF3a protein. Nevertheless, although 2019-nCoV ORF3a protein and SARS-CoV ORF3a protein are highly homologous (see Figure S67 ), the crystal structure of this protein is unknown up to now (see Figure S68 ). Fortunately, the crystal structure of the template protein for modeling 2019-nCoV E protein is realized experimentally (see Figure S69 ). Using SWISS-MODEL, the template was found successfully (see Figure S70 ). The sequence identity is more than 90% (see Figure S71 ). Regretfully, the crystal structure of the template protein for modeling membrane glycoprotein and ORF6 protein is deficient (see Figures S72-S75 ). Hopefully, the structure of the template protein of ORF7a protein has been identified experimentally (see Figure S76 ). Using SWISS-MODEL, the template was found successfully (see Figure S77 ). The sequence identity is more than 90% (see Figure S78 ). Currently, there is no suitable template protein for the homology modeling of ORF8 protein (see Figures S79 and S80) .",

Their work also pointed to the important discovery that the RBD domain of the 2019-nCoV S-protein supports strong interaction with human ACE2 molecules despite its sequence diversity with SARS-CoV S-protein and thus the 2019-nCoV poses a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S-protein-ACE2 binding pathway. 16 On this basis of the structure of 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) of 2019-nCoV, the joint team integrated the strategy of virtual screening and enzymology test, focused on the drug screening for the marketed drugs, as well as the self-built \"database of high-yield compounds\" and \"database of compounds from medicinal plants\", and quickly found 30 kinds of possible treatments for 2019-nCoV drugs, active natural products, and traditional Chinese medicine. A joint research team from the structural pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory has been working on the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia and their results showed that papain-like protease (PLP) encoded by coronavirus nsp3 played an important role in viral genome replication and escape from the antivirus natural immunity of the host. PLP not only has protein hydrolase activity but also has the activity of de ubiquitinase (DUB). PLP uses its protein hydrolase activity and DUB activity to evade the host's antiviral immune response and inhibit the expression of interferon through a series of molecular mechanisms. It is another enzyme besides the coronavirus 3CL hydrolase, which are important proteins necessary for human infection. To find the potential drugs to inhibit the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, the research team found that the 2019-nCoV PLP sequence has 86% amino acid homology with SARS-CoV PLP sequence. The research team built the protein structure of 2019-nCoV PLP by using homology modeling method, defined its drug-binding pocket, and screened the active molecules from the existing drug compound library of ZINC, the database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products established by their own laboratory by using the computer-aided structure-based virtual screening method. Then, 33 potential inhibitors of 2019-nCoV PLP were selected and expected to have possible anti-2019-nCoV activity. Several scientists speculated that Remdesivir may help fight the new coronavirus. The genetic material of the RNA virus is RNA (RNA ribonucleic acid). For the replication of the RNA virus genome, most of them need intermediate synthesis, which requires virus-specific polymerase (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp, or RNA dependent DNA polymerase, RdDp). These polymerases are ideal targets for the design of antiviral drugs. Remdesivir works by interfering with RdRp. It is a precursor drug of adenosine analog. After triphosphate in vivo, it is incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA chain of the virus as a substrate, and then the synthesis of the virus genome is in-",

In addition, the cartoons of the proteins modeled in this section are shown in Figure 1. We found that the main color of these ribbons is composed of blue, indicating that the structures of these proteins are stretched to a considerable extent. 3.3 | Homology modeling of the other proteins from 2019-nCoV The diameter of coronavirus is 80 to 120 nm. Under the electron microscope, the surface of virus particles has a club like protrusion, which is composed of spike protein (S protein). The envelope of the virus consists of membrane glycoprotein (M protein), which is embedded in the envelope of the virus through three transmembrane domains. In addition, a small amount of small transmembrane protein envelope protein (E protein) also appeared in the envelope. Finally, the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) binds to the RNA genome in the form of beads, forming a helically symmetric nucleocapsid.",

During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, scientists used protease inhibitors to reduce the viral load of patients, and protease inhibitors were also proved effective for MERS. Today's new coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS viruses, are all coronaviruses. Therefore, scientists speculate that protease inhibitors can reduce a load of new coronaviruses in patients. Protease inhibitor is a kind of drug targeting protease to treat AIDS. At present, the National Health Commission has recommended that anti-AIDS drugs can be included in the trial. Chinese scientists are testing the anti-HIV drug program to see if it is effective against the new coronavirus.
