Host genetics strongly influence susceptibility to infectious disease, with pathogens that affect reproductive fitness imposing selection on genes that impact disease outcomes (Karlsson et al., 2014). Nowhere in the human genome are these effects more evident than in the HLA region (Parham, 2005). Because of their vital role in providing immunity against diverse and rapidly evolving pathogens, the HLA-A, -B, and -C genes have been subject to strong balancing selection, making them the most diverse of human genes (Barreiro and Quintana-Murci, 2010, Trowsdale, 2011). HLA-A, -B, and -C arose by a series of gene duplications from a common ancestral MHC class I gene (Parham et al., 1995). These genes also serve as a reservoir of polymorphic sequences that can be recombined to create new HLA alleles that can provide protection against emerging pathogens. Although such new variants are thought to arise in human populations during episodes of Darwinian selection, there is little direct evidence for the nature of the process. HLA-B\u221746:01 provides a compelling example of such an episode.",

It most likely rose in frequency following a selective sweep of the type more often seen in small, isolated populations (Abi-Rached et al., 2010), and it is now carried by \u223c110 million individuals of Southeast Asian descent (Gonz\u00e1lez-Galarza et al., 2015). Despite its high frequency, HLA-B\u221746:01 is an unusual allele, formed by the recombination between HLA-B\u221715:01 and HLA-C\u221701:02. Similar intergenic recombinants have been identified (Hildebrand et al., 1992, Steiner et al., 2002), but none is found at comparable frequency, suggesting that HLA-B\u221746:01 fills an immunological niche not afforded by either parent or any other HLA class I variant found in the region. Supporting this notion, epidemiologic studies suggest that HLA-B\u221746:01 may confer protection against Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, which is endemic to Southeast Asia (Wang et al., 1999).",

A key feature of HLA class I is a short peptide, produced by intracellular protein degradation, that is bound during assembly of the HLA in the endoplasmic reticulum. KIRs and TCRs recognize the upper face of HLA and its bound peptide (Boyington et al., 2000, Fan et al., 2001, Garboczi et al., 1996). TCR recognition is exquisitely sensitive to the sequence of the bound peptide. KIR binding appears less so, though the rules that govern the peptide specificity of KIR have yet to be fully defined.",

Within this 11-residue segment, HLA-B\u221746:01 differs from HLA-B\u221715:01 at seven positions (K66I, Y67S, R69T, Q70N, A71T, D74Y, and V76E). Val76 is essential for the C1 epitope (Barber et al., 1996, Biassoni et al., 1995), and the KYRV motif at positions 66, 67, 69, and 76 reduces cell-surface expression of HLA-B\u221746:01 (Sibilio et al., 2008). Contributing to the TCR- and KIR-binding sites are residues 66, 69, 70, 71, 74, and 76 (Boyington et al., 2000, Fan et al., 2001, Garboczi et al., 1996).

This is most evident at P1 where Phe and Tyr are common, but not in either parent (Figure 2A). The HLA\u2217C\u221701:02 motif is different from the four broad motifs described for HLA-C (Rasmussen et al., 2014), in having Pro at P3 and Leu at P9 in >85% of its peptides.",

In the peptides bound by HLA-B\u221715:01 and HLA-B\u221746:01, pairs of residues at P2 and P9 are conserved. The most common motif observed in HLA-B\u221715:01 (\u223c35%) and HLA-B\u221746:01 (\u223c30%) peptides combines Leu at P2 with Tyr at P9.

For HLA-C\u221701:02 peptides, pairs of residues at P2 and P3 and at P3 and P9 are conserved. These peptides combine Ala at P2 with Pro at P3 and Pro at P3 with Leu at P9 (Figure S2C). Reflecting its hybrid structure, HLA-B\u221746:01- and HLA-B\u221715:01-binding peptides share the Leu2/Tyr9 9 pair of residues, whereas the HLA-B\u221746:01- and HLA-C\u221701:02-binding peptides share the Ala2/Leu9 pair of residues. Covariation between pairs of amino acid residues in peptides bound by MHC has been previously observed (Birnbaum et al., 2014), with structural analyses indicating it occurs due to alterations in the register of the peptide backbone, causing compensatory changes along the peptide-MHC interface (Chappell et al., 2015, Fremont et al., 1995, Koch et al., 2007).",

This number is 95 for HLA-B\u221715:01, 20 for HLA-C\u221701:02 and 20 for HLA-B\u221746:01 (Figure 4C; Figure S4). Thus, the HLA-B\u221715:01 peptidome has approximately five times the diversity of the HLA-C\u221701:02 and HLA-B\u221746:01 peptidomes. Calculation of diversity indices for each peptidome showed that HLA-B\u221715:01 is most diverse, followed by HLA-C\u221701:02 and then HLA-B\u221746:01 (Figure 4C). Together, these results show that HLA-B\u221746:01 has a smaller peptide repertoire that is less diverse in length, abundance, and amino acid content than its more closely related parent, and they highlight the formative effect of residues 66\u201376.",

Leprosy is endemic to Southeast Asia, where HLA-B\u221746:01 is found at high frequency (Figures 5A and 5B) (Gonz\u00e1lez-Galarza et al., 2015). We hypothesized that HLA-B\u221746:01 might be better adapted to present peptide antigens derived from M. leprae than one or both of its parents. To assess this possibility, we identified 22 antigenic M. leprae proteins (Wiker et al., 2011), and we used a nine-amino acid-sliding window to create a library of all possible nonamer peptides. Their binding to each allotype was predicted using NetMHC 4.0 (re-trained to include data from this study) (Nielsen et al., 2003).",

To assess their relative similarity to the HLA-C\u221701:02-like and HLA-B\u221715:01-like peptides, we used k-nearest neighbor clustering to define two discontinuous subsets. When divided in this way, 15% of HLA-B\u221746:01 peptides fall in HLA-C\u221701:02-like cluster 1 and 85% of peptides fall in HLA-B\u221715:01-like cluster 2 (Figure 5E, top panel).

This shift to the C\u221701:02-like cluster 1 is also noted in KIR-permissive peptides that are more than twice as likely to fall in cluster 1 (33%) as compared to the wider HLA-B\u221746:01 peptidome.

However, these residues are insufficient to confer reactivity with KIR2DL3 without HLA-C\u221701:02-derived Val76. We show that the interaction between KIR2DL3 and HLA is dependent on the length and sequence of the bound peptide. Consistent with previous studies using exogenous peptide, we found that KIR recognition of endogenously processed peptides was most sensitive to the amino acid at position 8 and more generally to those at the C terminus of the peptide, a region that corresponds to the KIR-binding site (Boyington et al., 2000). Although no structure of KIR2DL3 in complex with its ligand has been solved, comparison with KIR2DL2 bound to HLA-C\u221703:04 shows that Gln71 in the D1 domain forms a hydrogen bond with the amino acid at P8 (Boyington et al., 2000). The formation of this hydrogen bond brings Gln71, Ser184, and Glu187 of KIR2DL2 (residues that are identical in KIR2DL3) into such close proximity with the peptide that it constrains the size of the P8 side chain that would allow interaction with KIR. KIR2DL2 also directly contacts the amino acid at position 7 in the peptide, which is more exposed in this structure as compared to other HLA class I (Fan et al., 2001). Interestingly, we identified one peptide, the nonamer YANDFASEY, that bound KIR2DL3 despite having Glu at P8. This finding indicates that, despite a general preference for peptides with small size and low hydrophobicity and specifically for those without Glu at P8, KIR2DL3 is able to recognize selected peptides with these characteristics. Additional functional experiments are needed to confirm this finding. Furthermore, we found that Asn at P3 is significantly more common in KIR2DL3-permissive peptides, indicating that residues outside the KIR-binding site may also influence recognition of HLA-B\u221746:01 by KIR2DL3, presumably as a result of structural constraints imposed through the peptide backbone.",

Similarly, a previous study showed that KIR2DL3 recognized only a small number of exogenous peptides bound by HLA-C\u221708:02 (Sim et al., 2017). This specificity may explain why KIR2DL3 binding to C1 appears weaker than that of KIR2DL2 to C1 or KIR2DL1 to C2 (Hilton et al., 2012, Hilton et al., 2015a, Moesta et al., 2008). A second implication of this specificity is that the system may be usurped by pathogens. Supporting this possibility, previous studies have shown that HIV produces escape mutants (Alter et al., 2011, H\u00f6lzemer et al., 2015). One example is a mutation in the p24 Gag epitope that enabled significantly better binding of KIR2DL3 to HLA-C\u221703:04-expressing cells presenting the variant epitope (H\u00f6lzemer et al., 2015). Antagonism of NK cell function by peptides with weak affinity for KIR is likely to be another functional consequence of KIR2DL3 peptide selectivity. Although the specific molecular mechanisms that underlie the effect are unclear, peptides with weak affinity for inhibitory KIR antagonize those with high affinity, preventing inhibitory synapse formation and reducing the inhibitory signaling potential of NK cells (Borhis et al., 2013, Fadda et al., 2010). Previous estimates indicate \u223c30% of HLA-C\u221701:02-bound peptides provide strong ligands for KIR2DL2 and 2DL3 (Fadda et al., 2010). We find that only 7% of HLA-C\u221701:02-bound peptides and 21% of HLA-B\u221746:01-bound peptides provide strong ligands for KIR2DL3, suggesting that peptide antagonism may play a greater functional role than previously recognized.",

Although the cell-surface expression of HLA-B\u221746:01 has not specifically been studied, it is known to have increased intracellular retention due to prolonged association with HLA-dedicated chaperones (Sibilio et al., 2008). Thus, HLA-B\u221746:01 likely combines low-cell-surface expression with a low-diversity peptidome. By contrast, several studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between cell-surface expression and peptidome diversity (Chappell et al., 2015, Tregaskes et al., 2016). First described in the chicken MHC, an initial survey of four HLA-B allotypes shows a similar correlation, suggesting it is a broadly conserved feature (Chappell et al., 2015). Thus, HLA-B\u221746:01 appears an outlier in this regard and more characteristic of HLA-C than HLA-B. The relationship between cell-surface expression and peptidome diversity within HLA-C has not been extensively studied, although HLA-C allotypes are known to exhibit differential cell-surface expression (Apps et al., 2013).",

In the former category, HLA-B\u221746:01 may permit prioritization of peptides from a specific pathogen, allowing an individual to mount an effective immune response. One candidate pathogen is M. leprae that causes leprosy, a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and peripheral nerves. Leprosy emerged as a major infectious disease in the last 50,000 years as modern humans expanded outward across the globe from Africa (Monot et al., 2005). Infection rates likely peaked with the mass movement of people along trade routes between Africa and Asia prior to the advent of modern medicine (Karlsson et al., 2014). Leprosy is still common in many tropical regions, Southeast Asia being a notable hotbed of the disease (Reibel et al., 2015). Leprosy has exerted strong selective pressure on the human genome in general (Karlsson et al., 2014) and on the HLA region in particular (Chan, 1983, Franceschi et al., 2011, Shankarkumar, 2004, Shankarkumar et al., 2003, Takata et al., 1978, Zhang et al., 2009).",

Consistent with this finding, we show that HLA-B\u221746:01 is predicted to bind a significantly higher number of antigenic peptides derived from M. leprae than its parent allotype HLA-B\u221715:01 and a similar number to that bound by HLA-C\u221701:02. Because HLA-B\u221746:01 and HLA-C\u221701:02 are in strong linkage disequilibrium (Abi-Rached et al., 2010), the result is that HLA-B\u221746:01 carriers would have at least two HLA class I loci able to effectively present M. leprae-derived peptides. Presentation of M. leprae peptides to the TCR and KIR cells is likely to result in a strong cell-mediated immune response, which is a major determining factor in the clinical progression of leprosy (Kaleab et al., 1995, Ridley, 1974). Supporting a role for KIR-mediated immunity in the outcome of M. leprae infection, studies show that patients with the less severe tuberculoid form of leprosy have increased frequencies of activating KIR2DS2 and KIR2DS3 (Franceschi et al., 2008). Together these findings support the hypothesis that HLA-B\u221746:01 rose in frequency because it confers protection against severe infection caused by M. leprae.\n",

However, several studies suggest that it falls short in the second, predisposing individuals to autoimmune conditions, including myasthenia gravis (Chan et al., 1993) and Graves disease (Chan et al., 1978, Hawkins et al., 1985, Naito et al., 1987), as well as to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Chan et al., 1983). The apparent predisposition to self-reactivity may occur because of reduced TCR diversity (a likely result of its low-diversity peptidome), increased NK cell reactivity, or an as yet undiscovered mechanism. However, these data support the notion that there is an immunological trade-off between protection against infectious disease and protection against self-reactivity. Intriguingly, this hypothesis is consistent with the clinical observation that patients with psoriasis, an autoimmune skin condition, are protected from the development of leprosy (Dogra et al., 2003, Henseler and Christophers, 1995, Wahba et al., 1980).",

Briefly, 721.221 cells, which lack endogenous HLA class I expression, were transfected with constructs encoding soluble forms (sHLA) of HLA-B\u221715:01, HLA-B\u221746:01, and HLA-C\u221701:02. sHLA binds a similar peptide repertoire to membrane-associated HLA class I (Scull et al., 2012). The sHLA-peptide complexes were affinity purified from the cell supernatant on an anti-W6/32 Sepharose column, eluted, and the bound peptides dissociated from the HLA by denaturation in 10% acetic acid for 15 min at 75\u00b0C. Peptides were separated from the denatured proteins by passage through a stirred cell ultrafiltration device (3-kDa-cutoff membrane [Millipore]). The peptide-containing filtrate was lyophilized, re-suspended in 10% acetic acid, and separated into \u223c40 fractions by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described (Trolle et al., 2016). Each fraction was dried and re-suspended in 10% acetic acid for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Approximately 25% of each HPLC fraction was injected into a nano-scale reverse-phase liquid chromatography Eksigent nano-LC-4000 (Sciex) system. Column specifications, mobile phase solvents, and the elution gradient were as described (Trolle et al., 2016). Eluted fractions were ionized using a NanoSpray III (Sciex) ion source into a Sciex TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer.",

(B) The percentage of HLA-C\u221701:02 (blue, upper panel) and HLA-B\u221746:01 (orange, lower panel) peptides that are KIR permissive or non-permissive (gray) divided by length. (C) Kullback-Leibler sequence logos representing the amino acid preferences for nonamer HLA-B\u221746:01 KIR-permissive (top panel) and non-permissive (bottom panel) peptides. The colors of each amino acid correspond to their biochemical characteristics: acidic (red), basic (blue), hydrophobic (black), and polar (green). Sequence logos were generated using WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004). (D) Heatmap matrix showing the log10 p values comparing the frequency of amino acids (top panel, Fisher\u2019s exact tests) and concatenated amino acid properties (bottom panel, two-sample t tests) between KIR-permissive and non-permissive peptides bound by HLA-B\u221746:01. Increases in the frequency of an amino acid or the value of a biochemical property are shown in red, decreases in blue. Amino acids or properties that differ significantly between the groups are outlined in black. (E) Stabilization of HLA-C\u221701:02 expression on T2 cells as determined by DT9 staining (MFI shown on x axis) in the absence of peptide (wild-type) or with selected peptides pulsed at 100 \u03bcM and measured by flow cytometry. For (E) and (F), HLA allotype specificity and KIR2DL3 reactivity are indicated in the key. (F) Degranulation of donor-derived KIR2DL3+ NK cells incubated with T2 cells as determined by percentage CD107a expression in the absence of peptide (wild-type) or with selected peptides pulsed at 100 \u03bcM and measured by flow cytometry (bars represent mean \u00b1 SD). Horizontal lines indicate conditions in which degranulation differs significantly from wild-type (one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons, \u2217p < 0.05 and \u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.001).",

Color scale bars correspond to allele frequency categories. Frequencies are from allelefrequencies.net (Gonz\u00e1lez-Galarza et al., 2015). (B) Map showing the disability life-adjusted life year (DALY) for leprosy per 100,000 inhabitants of Southeast Asia (Mathers et al., 2008). Disability life-adjusted life year is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to disability, ill health, or early death. (C) Plots representing the number of nonamer peptides derived from Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella Enteritidis, H1N1 influenza, and HIV-1 predicted to bind each allotype.
