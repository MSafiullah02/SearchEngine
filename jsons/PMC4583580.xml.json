The overall rates of respiratory illness of approximately 5 pp/py and the pattern of decreasing rates with increasing age are similar to earlier studies [8]. However, our detection of viruses during approximately 60% of respiratory illnesses is higher than in previous studies. These differences are likely due to enhanced detection of viruses using highly multiplexed PCR. In the 1966 Virus Watch publication, no virus was detected in 86%\u201393% of illness episodes [12]. A more recent study of households by Monto et al used PCR and detected a virus in 47%\u201363% of acute respiratory illnesses [26]. Our rate of detection was higher, perhaps because the Monto study tested for fewer viruses than the BIG-LoVE study, and did not test for bocavirus, the second most frequently detected virus in our cohort [26]. The illness episodes in our cohort without a viral etiology may have been due to known or unknown viruses not detected by the FilmArray system, bacterial infections, or noninfectious causes.",

However, the association with symptoms varied by age and virus. Detections of human metapneumovirus, influenza A, and the parainfluenza viruses were strongly associated with symptoms (>75% for all viruses). In the clinical setting, detection of these viruses is likely associated with the illness under evaluation. In contrast, approximately half of the episodes of bocavirus and rhinovirus were asymptomatic, and prolonged asymptomatic detection occurred in 14% and 22% of episodes, respectively. Others have reported prolonged detection of bocavirus of up to 28 days [34]. The mean duration of rhinovirus detection by PCR in 1 study was 10.1 and 11.4 days for immune competent adults and children respectively [17]. Another study demonstrated rhinovirus detection for >30 days in approximately 5% of children younger than one year [36].

Third, in 28% of viral detection episodes, more than 1 virus was detected, limiting our ability to ascribe symptoms to individual viruses. An analysis of dual detection episodes is ongoing. Fourth, we have not completed sequencing of the rhinoviruses. It is possible that longer detection episodes may have included sequential infections with different rhinoviruses [31].
