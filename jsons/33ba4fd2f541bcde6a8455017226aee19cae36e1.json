            "text": "On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 was characterised as a pandemic-a global first for coronavirus. 1 Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness such as the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. 2 A novel coronavirus is typically a new strain of the infectious disease that has not been previously identified in humans. 2 There can be a tendency in the health promotion profession to think of infectious diseases from a biomedical viewpoint. As such, the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases is sometimes perceived to be the responsibility of the clinical realm. Yet, the reality is that both nonclinical and clinical public health responses are required-and sometimes we need to relax professional boundaries to work collaboratively for the health and wellbeing of our communities. We need to work in partnership with health surveillance teams, epidemiologists, environmental health scientists, public health physicians, infectious disease physicians, general practitioners, nurses, allied health professions, health policy-makers, health planners, health geographers and many others, to reduce the risks associated with pandemics. We also need to work across sectors to achieve the best possible outcomes. This has the potential to stifle health promotion efforts in times of need, such as during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is important to know who is saying what, why, and with what level of authority.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, we also need to be mindful of cross-sectoral communication efforts during pandemics. As an example, JS re- In health promotion, we need new strategies to communicate important health messages in a concise and meaningful way that makes it easy and accessible for citizens to understand, navigate and take action. We also need to be careful how we convey content through electronic communication channels and consider an appropriate level of frequency of such communication to achieve optimal impact. Without doing so, there is potential to reinforce community ambivalence at one end of the spectrum and create panic at the other. The recent toilet paper saga in Australia, whereby stocks of toilet paper were rapidly depleted from grocery stores in response to the perceived likelihood of home quarantining measures, is one such example (albeit somewhat humorous and embarrassing). Panic buying like this reinforces the powerful ramifications of communication gone wrong. Health literacy research that embraces new and emerging technologies will be particularly important to guide online health promotion efforts of this nature in the future.",

The Australian Government has since committed a $2.4 billion health package to protect all Australians from COVID-19, including vulnerable groups such as the elderly, those with chronic conditions and Indigenous communities. 5 The US Government pledged $50 billion on the same day.",

While COVID-19 has the potential to impact everyone in society, these impacts will be felt differentially. That is, the way we prepare, protect, treat, reduce transmission and innovate, needs to be viewed from a health equity lens. It is essential to recognise that pandemics-and the respective Government and corporate decisions that emanate-both influence and are influenced by social, economic and political determinants of health. As the WHO Director-General has recently stated-'all countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights'. 3 However, knowing what this 'fine balance' constitutes can be difficult. As such, it helps to reflect on what we know.",

We know that many developing countries do not have the surveillance systems, health resources and health infrastructure to respond in a manner that can slow the harms of COVID-19 in the way we would like. [6] [7] [8] We know that there are vulnerable populations, such as: the elderly, those with disabilities, people in prison, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, people with chronic conditions, and people from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds, that will be impacted disproportinately by COVID-19, particularly if assertive health promotion action is absent. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] We know that people from low socio-economic backgrounds, those who work in casual employment, and many racial and ethnic minorities, are unlikely to have the necessary financial resources to make self-distancing and self-isolation a viable option within the context of their daily livelihoods. [12] [13] [14] We know that access to health services in some countries, including basic primary health care, is contingent upon insurance and user-pays systems that already make them inaccessible to the people most at-risk. 15, 16 We know that the elderly and people with disabilities rely on public transport to access essential services, including food shopping and health services that are required during pandemics. 17, 18 We know that vulnerable populations may not have the necessary language and literacy skills to understand and appropriately respond to pandemic messaging. 19 We know that mental health concerns among the most vulnerable within our communities will be exacerbated by expectations to self-isolate if not approached sensitively. 20, 21 We know that governments have trouble implementing strategies focused on reducing health inequities through action on social determinants of health. 22 We know all these things, but what do we do about them?",

The WHO has encouraged us to think innovatively. 1, 3 The health promotion profession can lead this charge and advocate for a national public health social media campaign and other pragmatic measures that reach people most in need.

Messaging about health and hygiene, particularly hand-washing, is one example of the role that health promotion has played-ultimately drawing on our expertise in delivering health education, and implementing health-related mass media and social marketing campaigns. Over the last two decades, information technology and social media have transformed the way we can reach people during pandemics. Indeed, social media has catapulted the ability to reach large populations, while also simultaneously targeting vulnerable and at-risk populations, to deliver health messages, such as those associated with hand-washing. Over the past few weeks, there has been a steady flow of memes urging people to wash their hands, often with thoughtful use of graphics alongside a successful use of humour. JS's personal favourite, was an online post from Round Rock Texas that read: 'Texas Coronavirus Protection-wash your hands like you just got done slicing jalapenos for a batch of nachos and you need to take your contacts out (that's like 20 seconds scrubbing, y'all)'. It delivers an essential public health message in a factual, yet contextually relevant and humorous way. However, social media can also have its pitfalls. Misinformation and fake news are rampant.",
