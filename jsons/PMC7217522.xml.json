Processes mediated by disordered interaction patterns are affected by the topological properties of the underlying graph in nontrivial ways [1\u20133]. Spreading phenomena are among the most fundamental and studied types of dynamics occurring on networks [4]. In this context, a natural question, with implications for practical applications, is the following: given a network and a spreading dynamics on top of it, how can we identify the set of n \u201csuperspreaders,\u201d i.e., the n vertices such that, if the spreading process is initiated simultaneously by all of them, the average number of nodes reached by the spreading event is maximal? This problem is often indicated also as \u201cinfluence maximization,\u201d in particular in computer science, where fundamental results have been derived [5,6].",

As spreading may occur only if contacts are present, the identification of superblockers is equivalent to the solution of the so-called optimal percolation problem [7], i.e., the identification of the minimum set of nodes to be eliminated in order to destroy the giant component of the network. Superblockers effectively correspond to the nodes that, when removed, minimize the size of the largest connected component in the network.

            "text": "In their seminal work on the problem of optimal percolation [7], Morone and Makse hinted a strong connection between the identification problems of superspreaders and superblockers. The paper effectively describes the problem of identifying superblockers, but it always refers to superblockers as they were optimal spreaders, suggesting that essentially the two sets coincide. The analogy between superblockers and superspreaders may sound plausible from some point of view: it is natural to expect that both superblockers and superspreaders will be found among the nodes with largest connectivity. On the other hand, a conspicuous difference between the two problems is that optimal percolation depends only on the topological structure, while influence maximization depends (at least in principle) on the type of spreading process considered and on the detailed value of the parameters describing it. In Ref. [7], caveats about the distinction between the two problems are put forward, specifying that the mapping between influence maximization and optimal percolation is exact only for the linear threshold model with a very particular choice of the thresholds. A similar approach, based purely on topological information, has been recently used also for more general choices of the threshold [12]. For different types of spreading models, such as, for example, those belonging to the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) class, methods relying on the mapping to the optimal percolation problem are not a priori granted to work. Nonetheless, the idea that superspreaders and superblockers are equivalent in arbitrary spreading models has been rapidly adopted without further scrutiny [13\u201321] (Ref. [8] being an exception); this calls for a deeper and more careful investigation.",

By applying algorithms to determine independently sets of optimal blockers and sets of optimal spreaders for a large collection of real-world topologies, we are able to show that in general they are very different. Moreover, we clarify that the identity of superspreaders strongly depends on the only parameter of the ICM model: characterizing optimal spreaders based on purely topological network properties (with no reference to the specific spreading dynamics) is thus an impossible task.",

We use also a simplified version of the algorithm by Clusella et al., where node scores are not computed iteratively but they are set equal to their degree. This modification of the algorithm by Clusella et al. reduces slightly its performance, but it allows us to treat all networks in the same manner, without the need to determine additional ad hoc parameter values for every specific network. We remark that the CI and Clusella et al. algorithms provide only suboptimal solutions to the problem of identifying superblockers. However, the solutions they provide are sufficiently close to the optimum, so that we do not expect substantial variations if other, possibly more effective, algorithms for the identification of superblockers are used.",

For finite networks such as those we consider here, the distinction is blurred and somehow arbitrary. In practice, in our study we adopt the same convention put forward by Clusella et al.

We will therefore use the methods by Morone and Makse, and by Clusella et al. to assign nodes with a rank ranging from 1 to N. In one case, the order of the nodes will be established as the inverse order in which they are added in the algorithm by Clusella et al. In the other case instead, it will coincide with the order in which nodes are removed from the network according to the collective influence score. We will measure the agreement, as a function of \u03c1=n/N, between the set S(x) of best n superblockers found by methods devised to optimally destroy a network and the set S(C) of the best n superspreaders identified by a method specifically deployed for their identification (see below).

All other nodes are instead initially set as inactive. At each discrete time step t, two rules are applied in sequence: (i) each activated node i contacts all its neighbors j and, with an independent probability p, tries to activate each of those nodes that have been never activated during previous stages of the dynamics; (ii) all nodes that tried to activate their neighbors at step (i) become inactive, and they cannot be activated again in subsequent stages of the dynamics. The process is iterated until no more active nodes are present.

As for the case of superblockers identification, the algorithm we use for superspreaders identification does not determine the actual optimum, but just a suboptimal solution. Also in this case, we reasonably expect this approximation to have a very limited impact on the results. The outcome of Chen's algorithm is a ranking of all network nodes with an associated spreading power R(S(C),\u03c1): this value means that the set of superspreaders of size n=\u03c1N is made by all nodes ranked from 1 to n and that the average number of nodes reached by a cascade initiated by them is R(S(C),\u03c1).",

It becomes immediately clear that there is a huge variability among the different cases. However, by looking at the average value of J(x) (depicted in blue), two conclusions can be drawn.

It turns out that the sets of blockers identified using both Clusella and CI methods are far from being optimal spreaders: their performance is often even worse than the one resulting by randomly selecting the same fraction \u03c1c(x) of seeds. Similar results are confirmed in Fig. 3, where we consider the ratio R(x)/R(C) for arbitrary values of \u03c1. Superblockers are never good spreaders. Ranking nodes based on their degree is generally a much better strategy than ranking nodes using collective influence scores or the Clusella et al. algorithm.
