            "text": "Infectious agents, in the broadest sense, can spread in a \u2018population\u2019 of humans, animals, and nowadays technological devices. In the case of an outbreak, the goal is to minimize the damage to the \u2018population\u2019 without violating the constraints of a limited budget. Achieving this goal in \u2018populations\u2019 other than the primitive, well-mixed ones is the main reason why the problems of (i) epidemics spreading in complex networks (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001, Saumell-Mendiola et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2012, Wang and Xiao, 2012, Buono et al., 2014) and (ii) the corresponding immunization strategies (Balthrop et al., 2004, Bauch and Earn, 2004, Schneider et al., 2011, H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013) attracted considerable attention in the literature. Such a trend is further spurred by the outcomes of ineffectively controlled epidemics\u2014exemplified by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the swine flu (Schneider et al., 2011)\u2014which rapidly spread all over the world due to globalization and better means of transport (Colizza et al., 2007, Perra et al., 2012). An immediate concern, therefore, is the development of the effective countermeasures against epidemics, wherein immunization science plays an important, if not critical, role.",

            "text": "Multiple immunization strategies have been considered for complex networks. Uniform or random immunization (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2002) selects any node in the network with equal probability at each time step, which results in a strategy suitable for homogeneous networks, but ignores the fact that in highly heterogeneous networks eradicating an infective agent cannot be guaranteed regardless of the fraction of immunized nodes. Targeted immunization (Mirzasoleiman et al., 2012, Schneider et al., 2012) seeks to overcome this problem by selecting the nodes with the highest ability to spread the disease. Such ability is often measured in terms of degree centrality, defined as the number of ties a node has, or betweenness centrality, which indicates how often a node is located along the shortest route between two other nodes. A strategy based on degree centrality is highly effective, yet it neglects the structural significance of a node because the most connected nodes are not necessarily the ones that facilitate disease propagation from one dense cluster to another (H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013). Betweenness centrality can be used to overcome such a shortcoming, but suffers from a considerable computational cost (H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013). In general, targeted immunization requires global knowledge of network properties, which is impractical. Motivated by such an impracticality, so-called acquaintance immunization (Cohen et al., 2003, Gallos et al., 2007) was developed, whereby immunized nodes comprise only a small fraction of random neighbors of randomly selected nodes. Furthermore, a number of alternative and/or more specialized strategies have also been discussed (Fu et al., 2008, L\u00fc et al., 2011, Gong et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014, Yan et al., 2014). Owing to their immediate practical and economic implications, additional studies involving novel immunization strategies are still of considerable importance.",

The term biologically inspired is used in the sense that we draw inspiration from a single-celled, ameba-like organism Physarum polycephalum, capable of transporting signals and nutrients through a dendritic (i.e. tree-like) network of tubular structures called pseudopodia (Nakagaki et al., 2000). Physarum is particularly interesting because of the ability to perform cellular computations of a sort, which lead to the solution of, for example, the shortest path problem. This and similar observations served as a basis for constructing a mathematical model of an adaptive transport network driven by Poiseuille flow that exhibits computational abilities much like Physarum itself (Tero et al., 2007). Subsequently, a Physarum-type algorithm has been used for solving the Steiner Minimum Tree problem (Tero et al., 2008, Tero et al., 2010), for optimizing network design (Tero et al., 2010, Watanabe et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2015, Song et al., 2014), and for a variety of other applications (Zhang et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2013, Gao et al., 2013, Adamatzky, 2014, Adamatzky and Schubert, 2014).",

Namely, high rates of the protoplasmic flow stimulate the diameter of pseudopodia to increase, whereas at low flow rates the diameter tends to decrease. The pseudopodia thickness thus adapts to the flow rate. More formally, we observe a set of nodes N, containing two end-nodes, i\n1 and i\n2 (for biological reasons also called food-source nodes), and any number of in-between nodes, i\u2208N. The edge connecting nodes i,j\u2208N is denoted as i\u2013j and serves as a symbolic representation of a pseudopodium. Denoting by Q\nij the flux through edge i\u2013j (i.e. from i to j) and assuming the flow through pseudopodia to be approximately Poiseuille flow, we obtain:(1)Qij=\u03c0rij48\u03beLij(pi\u2212pj)=DijLij(pi\u2212pj),where \u03be is the viscosity coefficient of the sol, Dij=\u03c0rij4/8\u03be is a measure of the conductivity of pseudopodia (with r\nij being the radius), and pi is the pressure at node i. L\nij is the length of edge i\u2013j. One interpretation for these lengths follows from the fact that Lij\u22121 determines the importance of edge i\u2013j, which means that in an unweighted network Lij=1 for all possible is and js.",

We therefore pursue an R-local approach that considers only a subnetwork of the focal node comprised of the focal node's R-level neighbors and all the accompanying edges. Specifically, a proxy for the focal node's ability to spread the disease is obtained through the following steps:1.Take \u0393R(k), the set of all R-level neighbors of the focal node k.2.For each l\u2208\u0393R(k), one iteration of the model is run in which node l is the source and all other j\u2208\u0393R(k)\u222a{k} are the sinks.

The proposed immunization strategy is designed to quantify the ability of a focal node to spread the disease through the network. Put alternatively, we want to know (i) the extent to which the neighbors depend on the focal node and (ii) the relative importance of disease spreading pathways on which the focal node lies. Nodes 2, 3, and 4 in the inset of Fig. 2\n, for example, are just partially dependent on node 1 because they are, among others, connected by pathways excluding the latter node. Node 5, by contrast, is fully dependent on node 1. Furthermore, if we consider the spread of the disease from node 5 to node 3, path 5-1-3 is the most direct, but the disease can spread through alternative paths 5-1-2-3 and 5-1-4-3. Such alternatives need to be taken into account to properly determine the ability of the focal node to spread the disease. The original Physarum model cannot yield the desired result. If we imagine for a moment that the link between nodes 1 and 3 is removed and assume that path 5-1-2-3 is just a tiny bit shorter than alternative path 5-1-4-3, all flow would be assigned to the former path. Node 4 would consequently be disregarded as irrelevant for the spread of the disease, while nodes 1 and 2 would (wrongly) be considered of equal relevance. However, the possibility of having an epidemic spread via both paths (i.e. 5-1-2-3 and 5-1-4-3) would suggest that nodes 2 and 4 should be seen almost as equivalents, whereas node 1 is of more immediate concern. The role of the noise factor, \u03b3, is to resolve the described problem. Indeed, the three paths from node 5 to node 3 are properly distinguished in Fig. 2 based on the flows, if the value of the noise factor is set to some \u03b3>0.5.",

Although all strategies singled out nodes 1 and 16, this is where the similarities end. BCS and AS (Fig. 4b and c) go beyond the node degree to mark nodes 23 and 24, both with only two links, for immunization.

The results are shown in Fig. 5\n. Although AS performs very well, its performance is matched by DCS, which may seem surprising at first. However, random networks are not supposed to have structurally important nodes in the sense of H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al. (2013), i.e. nodes that connect dense clusters, but do not necessarily have a high degree themselves. In scale-free networks, by contrast, structurally important nodes are most likely the ones with a high degree. These results suggest that random and scale-free networks may be overly stylized for thorough performance testing of the considered immunization strategies.",

The former measure is instantaneous in nature, whereas the latter quantifies the cumulative effect of an epidemic. In a scale-free network, consistent with the results in Fig. 5, DCS is an effective immunization strategy, yet AS performs considerably better (Fig. 7a). In GR-QC network, based on Fig. 6b, one might expect that BCS rather than DCS performs well. Although this is precisely the case, AS achieves an even higher effectiveness (Fig. 7b). In the power network, judging from Fig. 6c, DCS is surprisingly weak, but such a lackluster performance may have been caused by a low fraction of immunized nodes (5%) in the presented example (Fig. 7c). More importantly, AS once again emerges as a clear victor. The same is even more pronounced in the Yeast network (Fig. 7d). In summary, the maximum infected fraction and the final recovered fraction are considerably (2\u201320 times) lower if AS is used instead of DCS, BCS, or CCS with the same fraction of immunized nodes.",

We then extended the model to include multi-foraging in order to obtain the dependence of other nodes on the focal one. This dependence is expressed in the form of a flow matrix, which indicates the ability of the focal node to spread the disease. Perhaps the most important properties of such a design are the ability to (i) distinguish situations that other comparable methods cannot and (ii) recognize structurally critical nodes that may not have a high degree themselves, yet they connect dense clusters of nodes.",

The proposed method partly overcomes these difficulties by being local in the sense of H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al. (2013). The information on a few R-local subnetworks can be used to start an immunization program, which can later be expanded in scope as the new information comes in.

Because the effectiveness of immunization programs may be hampered by a lack of information, perhaps the most immediate concern is to design the strategies that (i) perform well under information restrictions and (ii) can combine information from multiple sources. As for the restricted information, AS already functions locally, but achieves efficiency globally. To address the problem of combining several information sources, we may need to resort to the framework of multilayer networks (Wang et al., 2015), such that each network layer represents one type of information. Upon obtaining the AS-score in each layer separately, the results could be combined in a certain fashion to produce one overall score for the decision-making. In fact, optimizing the way in which the results are combined could be an interesting task for the field of intelligent computation (Du et al., 2016). Finally, the incentives for the different behavioral responses to an epidemic could be systematically incorporated into our framework by means of evolutionary game theory (Perc and Szolnoki, 2010, Wang et al., 2015).",
