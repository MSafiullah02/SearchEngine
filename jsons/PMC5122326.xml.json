TLR2, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 have a crucial role in host defense against HCV infection and HCV liver diseases [4\u20137]. Like other TLRs (TLR1, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10), TLR2 is predominantly expressed on the cell surface to sense extracellular PAMPs. In contrast, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are located in intracellular compartments and recognize viral nucleotides. TLR2 has been associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and is known to be triggered by the core-protein of the HCV nucleocapsid [8\u201312]. Intriguingly, specific TLR polymorphisms, mainly the TLR2 \u2212196 to \u2212174 ins/del, influence the extent of TLR2 expression and have been associated with more advanced liver diseases [13, 14]. TLRs signal through specific downstream molecules that finally activate transcription factors driving the expression of different cytokines including interferons [15, 16].",

Interferon-lamba (IFN\u03bb) is a family of four genes: IFN\u03bb1 (IL29), IFN\u03bb2 (Il28A), IFN\u03bb3 (IL28B) and IFN\u03bb4 (a frameshift variant of IL28B) [19]. They target the IL28R\u03b1 and IL10Rb receptors resulting in the activation of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling with expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and induction of an antiviral state. However, unlike type I IFN receptor, which was expressed on virtually all cell types, IL28R\u03b1 was only expressed on specific tissues such as epithelia [20]. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the IL28B gene, the rs12979860, was originally associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of genotype 1 HCV infection [2, 17, 21\u201326].",

In particular, a positive trend between TLR2 del/del genotype and an increasing risk for HCC (i.e CHC: 4.3%; CIR: 4.9%; HCC: 10.3%) was found; by contrast, the TLR2 del/del prevalence in NHL patients (0.9%) was similar to that found in BDs (1.3%).

Results of previous studies where IL28B C/C genotype enhanced the spontaneous resolution of HCV infection indirectly support a possible role for the IL28B C allele in the control of HCV infection. In keeping with these observations, we found a negative trend for CC genotype frequencies, balanced by an increased trend in TT genotype, in HCV-positive patients compared with BDs (IL28B C/C dominant polymorphism vs IL28B C/T+ IL28B T/T: OR 0.46 p = 0.025, Table 2). One-way test confirmed the significant positive trend for T allele in patients with chronic HCV-infection, which was more evident in patients with liver damage instead of a lymphoproliferative disorder (Figure 2). Thus, the analysis indicated a T allele gradient able to discriminate a chronic status more prone to evolve into liver injury from a condition more likely developing a lymphoproliferative dysfunction (p = 0.001, Figure 2).

            "text": "Immunogenetic profile may play an important role in determining the progression of chronic HCV infections to different diseases [1\u20133, 5, 27]. We confirmed the role of rs12979860 IL28B-C allele-carrier as a protective factor for CHC [2, 17, 21\u201326]. In addition, we highlighted that the IL28B C/C genotype correlates with lymphoproliferative disease when associated with a TLR2-ins allele in homozygosity (Table 4). On the contrary, homozygous TLR2-del allele (TLR2-del/del) exhibits a significantly higher threshold for HCC development (Figure 2). Overall, the present results were consistent with an interlocked role between TLR2 and IL28B (IFN-\u03bb3) gene variants in directing HCV-related diseases progression. Indeed, it has been shown that TLR2 was able to activate transcription factors that drive the expression of antiviral genes and different cytokines, such as interferons [15, 16]. Several studies have indicated a relation among rs12979860 IL28B gene, spontaneous clearance of HCV and therapeutic outcomes of genotype 1 HCV-positive patients treated with IFN-based therapies [2, 21\u201326]. In 2013 a new interferon, the IFN-\u03bb4, was identified. The rs368234815 polymorphism originating the IFN-\u03bb4 by creation of a new open reading frame [19, 28] was found in strong linkage disequilibrium with the rs12979860 IL28B so much it has been described as the functional variant of the rs12979860 IL28B [19, 29]. Thus, spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of HCV resulted equally dependent on rs12979860 or rs368234815 polymorphisms and combined assessment of these gene polymorphisms did not increase the predictive value of IL28B polymorphisms in HCV-positive patients [19, 29]. More recently, it was found that Y93H, a variant present in the NS5A region of HCV, was significantly associated with the beneficial rs12979860 polymorphism confirming the functional role of IFN-\u03bb4 SNP in HCV-infection [30]. The haplotype data presented herein (Table 4) provided evidence supporting a role for IL28B in relation with TLR2 polymorphism to predict progression to different HCV-related diseases. Recent functional studies have demonstrated that IL28B T/T genotype was associated with a higher production of IFN-\u03bb3 and higher ISGs gene expression in HCV-infected liver tissue, and that this higher baseline level of ISGs expression may contribute to an interferon-refractory state in the liver [31]. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the high baseline ISG levels found in IL28B T/T carriers can lead to a poor response to INF-based therapy due to an exhaustion of the interferon-response pathway [32]. In keeping with this model, a satisfactory treatment response could be associated with a IL28 C/C genotype, a lower levels of ISGs expression and thus a higher levels of circulating HCV RNA [33]. Our findings about higher viral load in patients having IL28B C/C genotype may support this hypothesis. A higher viral load was associated with HCV genotype 1, but difference among genotypes did not reach a statistical significance in our series. The observed broader frequency of IL28-T allele in patients with hepatic rather than lymphoproliferative disorders can be explained by the fact that the IL28-R/IL-10R receptor complex was expressed only in restricted cell types, like hepatocytes, epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [34]. Considering that HCV was primarily hepatotropic, it is reasonable to assume that IL28B-T allele could likely contribute to an IFN-refractory state mostly in the liver. In this regard, it has been observed that the expression levels of ISGs were differentially regulated in the liver and peripheral blood [35, 36]. In addition, higher level of HCV infection in hepatocytes induced higher level of endoplasmatic reticulum stress and caused HCC carcinogenesis [37]. In this scenario, TLR2-del variant, which was related to a diminished expression of TLR2 level, and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, increased the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment and the risk of HCC development [8, 13, 38]. Consistently, TLR2 knock-down (TLR2\u2212/\u2212) mice showed enhanced inflammation, hepatic lesions and HCC progression after carcinogenic diethylnitrosamine exposure [9, 39]. Moreover, the TLR2 del/del condition resulted more frequently detected in our HCC patients than in other HCV-related diseases (Figure 2). Data were in agreement with those observed in the HCV German population with an increased risk of HCC associated with the TLR2-del variant [13]. On the other hand, our multivariate analysis showed that IL28B C/C genotype was associated with a higher viral load (Table 5) and that the dominant wild-type haplotype (TLR2 ins/ins-IL28B C/C) correlated with lymphoproliferative diseases but also with BDs (Table 4). Likewise, previous studies have shown that HCV-core protein triggering TLR2 leaded to an increased in B-cell proliferation in vitro [18]. Thus, considering that HCV is also a lymphotropic virus, our haplotype analysis pointed out that in the presence of a HCV chronic persistence, the TLR2 ins/ins-IL28B-C/C arrangement could increase the susceptibility to lymphoproliferative complications, including mixed cryoglobulinemia and B-cell NHL (p = 0.029, OR 1.77, Table 4). In addition, the TLR2 ins/ins-IL28B-C/C haplotype not only showed a potential protective effect against HCV infection but also an association with older patients having a liver diseases (CIR and HCC, Figure 3), thus, suggesting that the protective effect associated with this haplotype decreased with age.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our study emphasizes that both TLR2 and IL28B polymorphisms may have a role in directing HCV-progression towards hepatic or lymphoproliferative diseases. Thus, the analysis of our HCV-positive population stratified by the two immunological variables indicated a potential protective effect of the IL28B-C allele in homozygosity (IL28B-C/C) towards chronic infection and liver diseases, and that the simultaneous presence of at least one TLR2-del allele abolished this effect. In accordance with this result, the TLR2-del/del state appeared closely linked with HCC condition. Conversely, the dominant wild-type haplotype (TLR2 ins/ins-IL28B C/C) associated with a better spontaneous resolution of the infection was also found more frequently in both BDs as well as in HCV-related lymphoproliferative disorders compared to CHC, suggesting that, in patients with a lymphoproliferative disease, additional factors may be involved that obstacle the elimination of the virus. Therefore, our findings shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the persistence of HCV infection and HCV-related disease progression. A deeper understanding of these processes may lead to development of strategies based on the combination of conventional therapies with immune-mediated strategies for the treatment of HCV-related diseases.",

Among HCV-positive patients, 230 had a chronic HCV infection (CHC n = 230), 123 patients had cirrhosis (CIR n = 123), 175 patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 334 patients had a lymphoproliferative disease including: 205 a cryoglobulinemic syndrome (MCS) defined according to previously described criteria [3] and 129 an overt B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Demographic and clinical characteristics of each groups were reported on Table 1. Patients had been recruited from: the MASVE Center, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Santa Maria degli Angeli, Pordenone, National Cancer Institute \u201cFondazione Pascale\u201d, Naples, Departement of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Bari Medical School, Policlinico Universitario di Udine and Centro di Riferimento oncologico di Aviano, Italy. The diagnosis of chronic HCV infection was based on anti-HCV, elevated ALT serum levels and HCV RNA positivity of at least 6 months duration. An immunoassay test (III-generation EIA) against HCV-core and HCV-non structural antigens were used. HCV genotype was determined by a commercial, certified, diagnostic test (Versant HCV Genotype 2.0, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL). Quantitative determination of HCV loads (RNA UI/mL) was done by branched DNA technology (Chiron, Emeryville, CA). The diagnosis of HCC was based on the standard criteria listed in the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) that incorporate both invasive and noninvasive measures. Noninvasive criteria include two imaging techniques, both demonstrating a focal lesion > 2 cm in diameter with features of arterial hypervascularization. Detection and immunochemical characterization of cryoglobulins were performed according to consensus protocol proposed by A.L.CRI (Associazione Italiana per la Lotta alle Crioglobulinemie). NHL in the course of HCV infection has been histopathologically confirmed based on WHO classification [3]. The study was conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and all subjects provided informed consent. Study was approved by independent local and independent ethics committees since this was a multicenter study.",
