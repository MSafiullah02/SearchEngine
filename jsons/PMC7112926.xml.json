            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enveloped, single-strand positive sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus \u03b1 of the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order (de Groot et al., 2010, Enjuanes et al., 2008) (see http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/g/vertebrate-2008/default.aspx for official coronavirus taxonomy). Coronavirus (CoV) infections cause a variety of enteric and respiratory diseases relevant in animal and human health, being of special interest the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans (Drosten et al., 2003, Perlman et al., 2000). The CoV genome is about 30 kb in length, the largest RNA virus genome known (Enjuanes et al., 2008, Masters, 2006). The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome contain the replicase gene that is made up of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and ORF 1b, the latter being translated by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Brierley et al., 1987, Brierley et al., 1989). Both ORFs are translated into two co-amino-terminal polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved autoproteolitically into up to 16 mature products (nsp1\u2013nsp16) that form the replication\u2013transcription complex, probably together with the participation of cellular factors (Enjuanes et al., 2006, Galan et al., 2009, Masters, 2006, Ziebuhr, 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). CoV replication and transcription are complex processes that take place at cytoplasmic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis (Gosert et al., 2002, Knoops et al., 2008, Masters, 2006, Snijder et al., 2006, Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2004).",

A DNA fragment containing the TGEV full-length RdRp coding sequence (nts 12,309\u201315,094; gi:13399293), flanked by SfoI and SalI restriction sites, was generated by PCR from a TGEV-derived replicon (Almazan et al., 2004) using the forward oligonucleotide 5\u2032-GCACTCCAA\nGGCGCCAGTTTTACTGTTGATCAAAGTTA(C)TT(G)AA(T)CGAGTGCG(C)GG(A)TC(A)AGTGCAGCTCGACTAGAACC-3\u2032 (SfoI site is underlined) and the reverse oligonucleotide 5\u2032-GGCTGG\nGTCGA\nCTATTATTGCAAGACAGTGGACTTTTCATAGAGGC-3\u2032 (SalI site is underlined and the termination codons are in bold). The 5\u2032 end of the RdRp coding sequence contains the slippery sequence and the pseudoknot structure responsible for the \u22121 ribosomal frameshift that allow the expression of ORF 1b. Therefore, the forward oligonucleotide was designed to eliminate the frameshift by the introduction of 6 silent mutations in the slippery sequence and the pseudoknot (showed in parenthesis) and to restore the reading frame by insertion of a C (showed in bold) just downstream of the slippery sequence. The PCR product was digested with SfoI and SalI and cloned into the same restriction sites of the intermediate plasmid pFastBacHT (Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain) to generate the plasmid pFB-His-RdRp, where the RdRp is fused to a His tag at the N-terminal region. This plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain) to generate a recombinant bacmid by transposition of pFB-His-RdRp expression cassette. Finally, H5 insect cells were transfected with the purified recombinant bacmid using Cellfectin (Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain) to generate the recombinant baculovirus rBV-His-RdRp. The recombinant virus was amplified in H5 cells and then high-titer virus stocks were obtained. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.",

Six out of the 35 hybridomas with the highest reactivity by both techniques were cloned twice by limiting dilution and the isotype of the secreted immunoglobulin determined (Table 1). Four of them (2C11, 5H1, 3C12, and 2B5) were IgG2a, one (3F9) IgG2b, and one (4D10) IgG1. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that all mAbs specifically recognized both the SDS-denatured and native recombinant protein in H5 cells infected with rBV-His-RdRp (Table 1), suggesting that the epitopes recognized by the RdRp mAbs were linear. Among these mAbs, 5H1 and 2B5 presented the lowest binding activity in both techniques, in agreement with their antibody titers that were lower than those of the other four mAbs (Table 1).

In the first step, the RdRp was subdivided into 4 overlapping fragments (F1\u2013F4) of around 250 aa according to the predicted RdRp domains (Fig. 4\nA). The coding sequence of the four fragments was obtained by PCR using specific primers (Table 2). These fragments were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA-3.1(\u2212), expressed using an in vitro transcription/translation system, and the binding of the mAbs to the RdRp fragments was analyzed by Western blot. All six RdRp specific mAbs recognized the fragment F1 that contains the first 263 aa of the RdRp (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, computer analysis of the RdRp sequence, using the DNASTAR software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, USA), showed that fragment F1 had the highest surface probability and antigenic index values of the entire RdRp (data not show). In the second step, the specific epitopes were identified by Pepscan analysis of the RdRp fragment F1. To this end, a synthetic peptide array containing 146 peptides of 10 aa each, overlapping in 8 residues, was generated using the SPOT-synthesis method (Frank, 2002) and probed with the RdRp mAbs by immunobloting. Four linear epitopes located in a 62 aa region from residues 97\u2013158 were identified (Fig. 4B). The epitope sequences were 97-DFFTYK-102 for 2C11 and 3C12, 117-TKYTMM-122 for 4D10, 125-CYAIRN-130 for 5H1, and 153-FFENKD-158 for 3F9 and 2B5.

Similar results have been reported in MHV, where RdRp protein precursors of about 150 and 300 kDa were detected (Brockway et al., 2003). RdRp was also recognized by immunofluorescence, showing a perinuclear vesicular pattern that is typical for CoV DMVs, where viral RNA synthesis takes place (Gosert et al., 2002, Knoops et al., 2008, Snijder et al., 2006).
