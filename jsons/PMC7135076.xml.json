Previously published research discussed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and primary study for the evolution of the novel coronavirus from Wuhan. The only report of clinical features of patients infected with 2019-nCoV was published on Jan 24, 2020, with 41 cases included.\nAdded value of this study\nWe have obtained data on 99 patients in Wuhan, China, to further explore the epidemiology and clinical features of 2019-nCoV. This study is, to our knowledge, the largest case series to date of 2019-nCoV infections, with 99 patients who were transferred to Jinyintan Hospital from other hospitals all over Wuhan, and provides further information on the demographic, clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory features of patients. It presents the latest status of 2019-nCoV infection in China and is an extended investigation of the previous report, with 58 extra cases and more details on combined bacterial and fungal infections. In all patients admitted with medical comorbidities of 2019-nCoV, a wide range of clinical manifestations can be seen and are associated with substantial outcomes.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older men with comorbidities, and could result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Early identification and timely treatment of critical cases of 2019-nCoV are important. Effective life support and active treatment of complications should be provided to effectively reduce the severity of patients' conditions and prevent the spread of this new coronavirus in China and worldwide.\n",

Patient 1 was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital and diagnosed with severe pneumonia and ARDS.

Later, the patient, having developed severe respiratory failure, heart failure, and sepsis, experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead. Patient 2 had severe pneumonia and ARDS after admission. The patient was transferred to the ICU and given ventilator-assisted breathing, and received anti-infection and ECMO treatment after admission. The patient's hypoxaemia remained unresolved. On the ninth day of admission, the patient died of severe pneumonia, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The intervals between the onset of symptoms and the use of ventilator-assisted breathing in the two patients were 3 days and 10 days, respectively. The course of the disease and lung lesions progressed rapidly in both patients, with both developing multiple organ failure in a short time.

The major SARS-CoV outbreak involving 8422 patients occurred during 2002\u201303 and spread to 29 countries globally.9, 10 MERS-CoV emerged in Middle Eastern countries in 2012 but was imported into China.11, 12 The sequence of 2019-nCoV is relatively different from the six other coronavirus subtypes but can be classified as betacoronavirus. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be transmitted directly to humans from civets and dromedary camels, respectively, and both viruses originate in bats, but the origin of 2019-nCoV needs further investigation.13, 14, 15 2019-nCoV also has enveloped virions that measure approximately 50\u2013200 nm in diameter with a single positive-sense RNA genome.16 Club-shaped glycoprotein spikes in the envelope give the virus a crown-like or coronal appearance. Transmission rates are unknown for 2019-nCoV; however, there is evidence of human-to-human transmission.

Common bacterial cultures of patients with secondary infections included A baumannii, K pneumoniae, A flavus, C glabrata, and C albicans.8 The high drug resistance rate of A baumannii can cause difficulties with anti-infective treatment, leading to higher possibility of developing septic shock.23 For severe mixed infections, in addition to the virulence factors of pathogens, the host's immune status is also one of the important factors. Old age, obesity, and presence of comorbidity might be associated with increased mortality.24 When populations with low immune function, such as older people, diabetics, people with HIV infection, people with long-term use of immunosuppressive agents, and pregnant women, are infected with 2019-nCoV, prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce complications and mortality.",

This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes. Some patients progressed rapidly with ARDS and septic shock, which was eventually followed by multiple organ failure. Therefore, early identification and timely treatment of critical cases is of crucial importance. Use of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for severely ill patients and steroids (methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg per day) are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible. Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body's cellular immune function. Damage to T lymphocytes might be an important factor leading to exacerbations of patients.25 The low absolute value of lymphocytes could be used as a reference index in the diagnosis of new coronavirus infections in the clinic.",

The brightness of both lungs was decreased and multiple patchy shadows were observed; edges were blurred, and large ground-glass opacity and condensation shadows were mainly on the lower right lobe. Tracheal intubation could be seen in the trachea. Heart shadow roughly presents in the normal range. On the left side, the diaphragmatic surface is not clearly displayed. The right side of the diaphragmatic surface was light and smooth and rib phrenic angle was less sharp. Chest x-ray on Jan 10 showed worse status (2B). Case 3: chest CT obtained on Jan 1 (3A) showed mass shadows of high density in both lungs. Bright bronchogram is seen in the lung tissue area of the lesion, which is also called bronchoinflation sign. Chest CT on Jan 15 showed improved status (3B).",
