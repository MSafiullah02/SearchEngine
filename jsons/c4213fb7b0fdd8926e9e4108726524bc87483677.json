The first average is about 17 persons and the second average is 102 persons with March 30, 2020 as the break date (see Figure 2 ). Analysis of the data with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF) is proof of acceptance of the null hypothesis (H0) and the risk of rejection of the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is less than : 89% for the series of new cases of COVID-19.
