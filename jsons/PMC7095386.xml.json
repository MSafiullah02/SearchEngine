Many investigations have confirmed the benefits of MSCs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI therapy, mainly due to their immunomodulation capacity and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (Li et al. 2016; Shi et al. 2010). Modification of certain anti-inflammatory genes, such as IL-10 (Wang et al. 2018a), nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) (Zhang et al. 2018b) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) (Chen et al. 2019), can further enhance the immunosuppressive potential of MSCs and achieve better outcomes in ALI intervention. However, most of these findings were discovered based on cells administration post ALI modeling; the protective effects of MSCs pretreatment have not been well described.",

Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated from 6-week-old mice as described previously (Yao et al. 2015). In brief, cells from adipose tissues near the groin and epididymis were adherently cultured in \u03b1MEM (Gibco, USA) containing 20% FBS and 5000 U/mL PS. The culture medium was replaced every three days until the cell confluence reached approximately 90%. The 3rd passage cells identified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) after staining of surface markers were used for gene modification. Briefly, about 1 \u00d7 105 ADSCs per sample were resuspended in 50-\u03bcL PBS and incubated with 2-\u03bcL phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies CD29 and CD44 (eBioscience, USA), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD45 (eBioscience, USA) and CD90.1 (eBioscience, USA) antibodies separately for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. Then, the cell suspension was centrifuged and subsequently washed with PBS and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The staining positive cells were detected by a flow cytometer (BD FACS Calibur, USA) and cells without any label served as negative control. Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (version 7.6.1, USA).",

One day before transfection, HEK293T cells were plated, and the cell fusion rate was approximately 80% after 24 h. HEK293T cells were transfected using FuGENE\u00ae HD Transfection Regent (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Specifically, the retroviral vector pMSCV-IL-35-GFP or pMSCV-GFP combined with another two helper plasmids and FuGENE were dissolved in equal volume of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, USA) medium, respectively. Then, the plasmids and transfection reagent were mixed for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was evenly added to HEK293T cells maintained in 5-mL Opti-MEM medium and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. After 6 h, another 5-mL fresh DMEM medium containing 10% FBS was supplemented and the cells were continued to be cultured for 48 h. The supernatant rich in retrovirus particles was collected, followed by centrifugation at 1500\u00d7g for 10 min and filtering through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter. Then, the filtrates were condensed at 10:1 ratio using a 100-kDa evaporating column (Millipore, USA). ADSCs at the 3rd passage were exposed to 1-mL of concentrated IL-35-GFP or GFP virus in 2-mL of medium for 6 h in 10-cm cell culture dishes in the presence of 8 \u03bcg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and were expanded to the 4th passage. The transfection efficiency of ADSCs modified by IL-35 (IL-35-ADSCs) or GFP (GFP-ADSCs) and the exogenous gene expression were determined via FACS and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) before cell injection. In addition, the culture medium of IL-35-ADSCs and GFP-ADSCs was collected 48 h post transfection to detect the concentration of IL-10.",

In the early stage of ALI, alveolar inflammation is primarily mediated by neutrophils, whose aggregation can be found several hours post ALI (Grommes and Soehnlein 2011; Lin et al. 2018; Williams and Chambers 2014). Macrophages are also involved in the acute phase of ALI (Henderson et al. 2003; Marriott and Dockrell 2007). Besides inflammatory cell infiltration, a variety of pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 contribute to inflammatory cell recruitment and inflammation propagation (Chen et al. 2019; Matthay et al. 2012).

As reliable biomarkers of ALI animals or patients, pulmonary IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were also most effectively inhibited in mice that received IL-35-ADSCs (Fig. 5a). Similar to the H&E staining results, many more MPO+ neutrophils and CD68+ macrophages could be observed in the lungs from saline + LPS mice, and ADSCs injection effectively inhibited these infiltrates (Fig. 6a). Lungs treated with IL-35-ADSCs exhibited significantly decreased neutrophil and macrophage accumulation compared with that in GFP-ADSCs + LPS group lungs (Fig. 6b). In addition, IL-35-ADSCs infusion greatly suppressed TLR4 expression compared with that in GFP-ADSC-treated mice (Fig. 7). These data indicate that IL-35-ADSCs pretreatment effectively attenuated local inflammation in LPS-challenged lungs.",

Previous research has demonstrated that Tregs can protect lungs from inflammatory injury (Lin et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019). Compared with GFP-ADSCs + LPS group mice, the number of splenic CD4+CD25+ Tregs was remarkably amplified in IL-35-ADSCs-treated mice, primarily due to the elevated IL-35 level (Fig. 4). It has been reported that Th17 cells-mediated inflammation also participate in the inflammatory process of ALI, and the unbalanced Tregs/Th17 cells often exist in ALI animals or patients (Wang et al. 2018b; Zhang et al. 2016). Reversed Tregs/Th17 cells contribute to amelioration of the damage induced by ALI. The Th17 cells was not detected here, but we have found that IL-35 upregulation significantly increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells and reduced IL-17A+ Th17 cells of the spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis models (Zhang et al. 2018a). The growth of Tregs might also facilitate the ALI inhibition.",
