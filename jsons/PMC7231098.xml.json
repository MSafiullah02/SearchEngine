Though most infected individuals exhibit mild symptoms including fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, shortness of breath, and diarrhea [2], or are asymptomatic altogether [3], severe cases of infection can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death [4]. Globally, at least 7900 deaths have been directly attributed to COVID-19 [1], and this number is expected to rise with the ongoing epidemic.",

A mathematical modeling study [8] showed that a 25% reduction in transmissibility from the nationwide implementation of control measures would lead to a 50% reduction in the magnitude of the epidemic and a one month delay in the epidemic peak. The study, however, found that citywide quarantine in Wuhan in which all inbound and outbound mobility were to be eliminated would have little effects because local epidemics may have already occurred in other provinces across China by then [8]. Similarly, another published study concluded that the quarantine of exposed individuals identified through contact tracing in Wuhan had little effect in reducing the number of infections and slowing down the epidemic across China [18]. Incorporating the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission in simulating the spread of COVID19 across China with different levels of quarantining, a recent preprint highlighted that the effectiveness of quarantine largely depends on when it is implemented and the proportion in quarantine. The study suggested that the quarantine rate should be at least 63% (threshold) for the epidemic to be averted [13] and that such strong control measures should be kept in place over the course of the outbreak.",

More recent analyses in preprint used a much larger sample that includes up to 468 pairs [35], making their estimates of between 4 to 5 days more statistically reliable (given that all methodologies are sound and valid) with a smaller margin of errors. As highlighted in the literature, a serial interval shorter than the incubation period could imply pre-symptomatic transmission and thereby should be considered in formulating intervention strategies, as it may impede containment efforts. The serial interval estimates for SARS-CoV-2 is also shorter than that of SARS-CoV (8.4 days) [25] and MERS-CoV (8-13 days) [34,38], which suggests that it may be more challenging to contain the spread compared to other coronaviruses.",

The effectiveness of these containment measures in controlling the outbreak, however, remains inconclusive.

While school closure is less effective than workplace distancing or quarantine of exposed individuals, a combined strategy which implements all three measures together was found to be most effective in reducing the spread. Airport screening is shown to be not as effective either, detecting only 34% [52] to 54% [51] of infected travelers through thermal scanning. An important implication to this is that the effectiveness of such control measures could be further hampered by a significant portion of asymptomatic patients (17.9%, 95% CrI: 15.5\u201320.2%) [49] and pre-symptomatic transmission (12.1%), as evidenced from early analyses [35,36].",
