Likewise, published case studies reporting clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have shown that they may develop different degrees of liver dysfunction (summarized in Table 1\n). In these studies, the incidence of liver injury ranged from 14.8% to 78%, mainly presenting with abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied by slightly elevated bilirubin levels [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. A deeper look at available data shows higher rates of abnormal levels in severe COVID-19, as high as 78% in one study [18].",

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter its target cells [20]. Data from two independent cohorts revealed significant enrichment of ACE2 expression in cholangiocytes (59.7% of cells) compared to hepatocytes (2.6% of cells) suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function [21]. Although ACE2 is highly expressed in bile duct cells, recent works suggest that gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was elevated in 54% of COVID-19 patients, whereas only 1.8% of patients (1/56) had elevated alkaline phosphatase level [22]. Elsewhere, pathological analysis of hepatic tissue from a patient who died from COVID-19 did not find viral inclusions in the liver [23].",

Previous studies have shown that inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV [24] or MERS-CoV infection [25]. Inflammatory cytokine storm is an overactive inflammatory response, which leads to persistent activation of lymphocytes and macrophages that secrete huge amount of inflammatory cytokines [26]. Lymphocytes are important for inhibiting overactive innate immune responses during viral infection [27]. Thus, the typical lymphopenia during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels and aggravated inflammatory responses, leading not only to pulmonary injury, but also the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver [28]. A study of the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, found that lymphopenia and CRP level were independently associated with liver injury, suggesting that inflammatory cytokine storm might be the major mechanism [29].",

Furthermore, the distribution of aminotransferase levels among patients with COVID-19 does not support hypoxic hepatitis being common [30]. Importantly, drug-induced liver injury during COVID-19 treatment should be carefully investigated. It might be caused by antiviral medications (lopinavir/ritonavir), antipyretics (acetaminophen), antibiotics (macrolides, quinolones) or steroids [31]. In a paper describing the first 12 patients with COVID-19 in the United States (U.S.), the three hospitalized patients, who received remdesivir at the time of clinical worsening, reported elevated liver enzymes [32].",

Finally, liver transplantation might involve a risk of transmission of viral infection from donor to recipient, as shown in the previous SARS outbreak [36]. Michaels and colleagues recently described possible risks associated with transplant in COVID-19 positive recipients [37].

Firstly, interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 might result in diarrhoea. A recent bioinformatics analysis revealed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in alveolar type II (AT2) cells in the lung, but also in the glandular cells of gastric and duodenal epithelia [44]. Similar findings were found in the study by Liang et al. [45], ACE2 was highly expressed in proximal and distal enterocytes, directly exposed to food and foreign pathogens. The ACE2-expressing enterocytes are invaded by SARS-CoV-2, leading to malabsorption, unbalanced intestinal secretion and activated enteric nervous system, resulting in diarrhoea finally [44]. Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 indirectly damages the digestive system through a chain of inflammatory responses [42]. Another possible factor causing diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients might be antibiotic associated diarrhea [43]. Finally, changes in the composition and function of digestive tract flora mutually affect the respiratory tract through immune regulation, the so-called \u201cgut-lung axis\u201d [46].",

Considering the evidence of faecal excretion for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [49], it is possible that the digestive system may serve as an alternative route of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been reported that the stool from confirmed cases tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 [39]. In terms of the fact that most of the patients in the initial outbreak reported a link to a wild animal market, this observation raises questions about whether this virus was transmitted via contaminated food at the small intestine [45]. Another issue of potential significance, is the extended duration of viral shedding in faeces. In one study, it was observed that for over half of patients, faecal samples remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a mean of 11.2 days after viral clearance in respiratory tract samples [50]. According to current guidance, the decision to discharge hospitalized COVID-19 patients is based on negative results of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected \u226524 h apart [51]. Therefore, routine stool sample testing with RT-PCR could be added and transmission-based precautions should be continued if faecal samples test positive [50].",

This may have implications for the management of patients with pre-existing digestive diseases [52]. Patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection, however, whether patients with gastrointestinal cancers are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than healthy individuals remains unknown [48]. In a nationwide analysis from China, 18 (1%) of 1590 COVID-19 cases had a history of cancer. Among these 18 cases, three had a history of colorectal cancer. Patients with COVID-19 and cancer had a higher risk of severe events [53]. Likewise, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using biologics and immunosuppressive agents are at increased risk for more frequent and severe infections and could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [48]. Fortunately, with early precautions for COVID-19 prevention and control, not a single patient of the 318 patients (204 with ulcerative colitis and 114 with Crohn\u2019s disease) in the IBD registry in Wuhan, has been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 [54]. These precautions included recommendations on the use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, diet, and intentional postponement of elective surgery and endoscopy, as well as personal protection provisions [55]. In regard to recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, experts in faecal microbiota transplantation believe that screening of stool donors is needed, as the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than that in other tissue transplants [56].",

Based on prior experience from SARS and our current understanding of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, the following steps should be implimented in endoscopy units:1.\nReduction of non-essential exposure to SARS-CoV-2: It is recommended to limit endoscopy during the current outbreak to emergency procedures to treat patients with conditions such as acute gastrointestinal bleeding, foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract and acute cholangitis secondary to biliary obstruction [62].2.\nRisk assessment and stratification of patients prior to any endoscopic procedure: A high index of suspicion to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, is crucial for prevention of transmission. Screening of patients for COVID-19 should be based on case definitions established by WHO and local health authorities [63]. The assessment must include history of fever, respiratory symptoms, or diarrhea, history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 and any recent travel to a high-risk area [61].3.\nNegative-pressure room: Whenever possible, endoscopy should be performed in an isolated room with negative pressure. If not available, endoscopy should be performed in a dedicated room with adequate ventilation [64].4.\nStaff protection: The minimal composition of personal protective equipment (PPE) for personnel in endoscopy units should include gloves, hairnet, protective eyewear (goggles or face shield), waterproof gowns, and respiratory protective equipment, modified on the basis of risk stratification [61]. The surgical facial mask is effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, whereas, filtering facepiece (FFP) respirator class 2 or 3 (FFP2/FFP3) achieves efficient filtration of airborne particles (up to 0.3 \u00b5m) [65]. In addition to PPE, health care workers must be educated the principles of contact and airborne precautions for both suspect and probable COVID-19 patients [64].5.\nReprocessing of endoscopes and endoscopic accessories: Enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 can be inactivated by disinfectants having virucidal activity [67]. Whereas high-level disinfection is recommended for endoscopes, and other \u2018\u2018semi-critical\u2019\u2019 instruments, sterilization is recommended for \u2018\u2018critical\u2019\u2019 instruments, including biopsy forceps, polypectomy snares and papillotomes. Disposable accessories are an alternative to sterilization of reusable devices [68].6.\nDecontamination of endoscopy rooms: This process should include cleaning all surfaces in the procedure room to remove all soil and biofilm, followed by proper disinfection [61]. Chlorine-containing detergents are recommended for floor cleaning every day [67].\n",
