The cat showed visual disorder, trismus and cognitive impairment and died at 9 months of age. At necropsy, significant discoloration of the white matter was observed throughout the brain and spinal cord. Histologically, severe myelin loss and gliosis were observed, especially in the internal capsule and cerebellum. In the lesions, severe infiltration of macrophages with broad cytoplasm filled with PAS-positive and nonmetachromatic granules (globoid cells) was evident. On the basis of these findings, the case was diagnosed as feline globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease). Immunohistochemical observation indicated the involvement of oxidative stress and small HSP in the disease.",

            "text": "Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD; also known as Krabbe's disease) is an early-onset, rapidly progressive and fatal degenerative disease. The disease is pathologically characterized by almost complete myelin loss, reactive astrocytosis and the appearance of characteristic large round cells called globoid cells in the white matter of the CNS. 1 Diseases identical to GLD have been reported in several animal species: 2 dogs, 3, 4 sheep, 5 rhesus monkeys 6, 7 and cats. [8] [9] [10] GLD is defined by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme, galactocerebrosidase (GALC), resulting in the accumulation of a cytotoxic metabolite, psychosine. 1 GALC-deficient mice, such as Twitcher mice, 11, 12 are being used as experimental GLD models. 13 Besides GALC, the deficiency of saposin A, 14 one of the sphingolipid activator proteins, also causes an identical disease to GLD in mice 15 and humans. 10 While GALC mutation was found in dogs 16 and rhesus monkeys. 17 To date, there have been only three reports of the disease in cats, [8] [9] [10] indicating that the disease is extremely rare in cats. These previous reports on feline GLD revealed histopathological features characterized by symmetrical myelin loss, astrocytosis and perivascular accumulation of large macrophages with intracytoplasmic deposits (globoid cells).",

Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2)-positive oligodendrocytes slightly decreased in number. These lesions were severe in the white matter of the internal capsule, cerebellum, medulla and spinal cord, but relatively less severe in the white matter of the cerebrum. In the deep white matter of the cerebellum, focal and symmetric necrosis was evident. In the necrotic areas, there were many calcified deposits forming psammoma bodies. The bodies were stained with LFB, PAS and von Kossa (Fig. 4) . In the gray matter throughout the brain and spinal cord, prominent proliferation of gemistocytic astrocytes was observed. In the cerebellar cortex, there was moderate loss of granule cells and Purkinje cells with proliferation of Bergmann's glia.

A slight decrease of olig2-positive oligodendrocytes in spite of the severe myelin loss suggests that feline GLD may be a disease mostly caused by the dysfunction of myelination, maybe due to psychosine accumulation, rather than by the degeneration of mature myelin. Biochemical analysis or analysis of GALC or the saposin A gene was not performed because all tissues were unfortunately formalin-fixed at nectropsy because of the suspicion of infectious diseases. To determine whether this feline disease is exactly the same as human GLD, gene analysis should be performed. The infiltration of CD3-positive T cells into the lesions in the present case indicates the involvement of immunological responses in the pathogenicity of the feline disease, like in human GLD. 19 However, the infiltration was not very severe in view of the longer survival and/or because of steroid treatment.",

On the other hand, in the present case, SOD2, a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, was strongly expressed by globoid cells themselves. SOD1 17 and HO-1, 23 astrocytes. Although it is interesting that the iNOS expression patterns vary among animals, it may be a common accelerating factor for disease progression, not an exclusive factor for the pathogenesis. The induction of the antioxidant enzymes may be a physiological consequence in the recovery of neuronal tissue following oxidative damage. Increased expressions of \u03b1B-crystallin and HSP27 were reported in Rosenthal fibers of Alexander's disease and in GFAP-positive gliosis lesions of human neurodegenerative diseases, 18 but the roles of these molecules in the pathogenicity of such neurodegenerative diseases are still controversial.
