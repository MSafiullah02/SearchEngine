A critical element in reducing transmission of the virus is rapid and widespread behavioural change. Evidence shows that a perceived lack of consistency, competence, fairness, objectivity, empathy, or sincerity in crisis response in the public could lead to distrust and fear.1 Conversely, when the public perceives measures as having these characteristics, as well as being easily understood and communicated through trusted and accessible channels, and when the necessary services are available, people are able to make informed choices, protect themselves, and comply with recommended practices.2, 3\n",

This was seen during the influenza pandemic in 2009-10,5 where uncertainty and perceived exaggeration were also associated with a reduced likelihood to implement the recommended behaviours.6 Models of crisis and risk communication thus suggest that understanding risk perceptions is critical for an effective and appropriate crisis response.7 At the same time, not enough is known about the complex interplay of changing epidemiology, media attention, pandemic control measures, risk perception, and public health behaviour.5\n",

This includes knowledge about what drives behaviour and awareness of changes in these drivers.1, 3 Other psychological challenges, such as misinformation, stigmatisation, or herd behaviour (such as hoarding of food or toilet paper) can be monitored to help estimate their prevalence and to identify sources. National authorities and other stakeholders, such as the media, can gain valuable insights into information needs, contextualisation of certain phenomena (eg, stigmatisation), and which target groups need additional attention. A few countries have rapidly initiated studies to gain such insights, and more countries are urged to prioritise such efforts, not in lieu of, but as a necessary supporting mechanism for other response measures.",

WHO and international partners can share such tools allowing countries to do this.

Changes in risk perceptions or knowledge can be assessed over time; data on acceptance of new response measures can be made rapidly available; and misinformation or possible stigma can be identified as they emerge. Immediate data analysis by means of an automated data analysis website provides fast access to the results. WHO materials contain commented code (free R Studio online software) for data analysis and a website for rapid data presentation. The Insights Unit and Health Emergencies Programme in the WHO Regional Office for Europe are offering support to countries for implementation. National teams using the tool are urged to work in partner coalitions to discuss insights gained and implications for outbreak response interventions, policies and messages. Making results rapidly available to journalists is also suggested to support high quality and responsible media reporting. Journalists need timely knowledge about developing audience behaviour and habits to rapidly tailor information sharing and to develop narrative tools that encourage behaviour changes according to evidence from risk communication research.",
