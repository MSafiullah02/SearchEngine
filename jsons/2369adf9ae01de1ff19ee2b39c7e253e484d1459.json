Several studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS [7] and MERS-CoV infection [8] , and recently in COVID-19 [5] .

Table 2 presents the laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19. Among 452 patients who underwent laboratory examinations on admission, most of them tended to have lymphopenia, higher infection-related biomarkers (i.e. procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein) and several elevated inflammatory cytokines (i.e. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-2R and IL-6), and there were numerous differences in blood cell counts and infection related biomarkers between severe group and non-severe group. Severe cases had higher leukocyte (5.6 vs 4.9 \u00d710\u2079 ; P < 0.001) and neutrophil (4.3 vs 3.2 \u00d710\u2079 ; P < 0.001) counts, lower lymphocytes counts (0.8 vs 1.0 \u00d710\u2079 ; P < 0.001), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (5.5 vs 3.2; P < 0.001) as well as lower percentages of monocytes (6.6 vs 8.4 %; P < 0.001), eosinophils (0.0 vs 0.2 %; P < 0.001), and basophils (0.1 vs 0.2 %; P = 0.015). Compared with non-severe group, most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers, including procalcitonin (0.1 vs 0.05 ng/mL; P < 0.001), serum ferritin (800.4 vs 523.7 ng/mL; P < 0.001), and C-reactive protein (57.9 vs 33.2 mg/L; P < 0.001). A bunch of inflammatory cytokines were also elevated in severe cases than the non-severe ones, including interleukin (IL)-2R (757.0 vs 663.5 U/mL; P = 0.001), IL-6 (25.2 vs 13.3 pg/mL; P < 0.001), IL-8 (18.4 11 vs 13.7 pg/mL; P < 0.001), IL-10 (6.6 vs 5.0 pg/mL; P < 0.001), and TNF-\u03b1 (8.7 vs 8.4 pg/mL; P = 0.037). Immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) and complement proteins (C3 and C4) in patients with COVID-19 were within normal range. There were no significant differences in the levels of IgA, IgG, and complement proteins C3 or C4 between the mild and severe groups, while IgM slightly decreased in severe ones.",

Cytokines and chemokines have been thought to play an important role in immunity and immunopathology during virus infections [16, 17] . Although there is no direct evidence for the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung pathology during COVID-19, the change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients were correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Virus-induced direct cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to play major roles in disease severity [16, 17] . A rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infections, however, when immune response is dysregulated, it will result in an excessive inflammation, even cause death [18] . In our study, we demonstrated pronounced lymphopenia and low counts of CD3+ cells and CD4+ cells in COVID-19 cases. The differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T-cells into effector and memory subsets is one of the most fundamental facets of T-cell-mediated immunity [19] . And the balance between the na\u00efve and memory CD4+ T cells is crucial for maintaining an efficient immune response. Our results of lymphocyte subsets with higher na\u00efve CD4+ T-cell subpopulations and smaller percentages of memory cells, higher na\u00efve: memory ratio, in severe cases indicated that immune system in severe infection subgroup was impaired more severely. In addition, the decrease of regulatory T cells, especially induced regulatory T cells which have a key role in restraining allergic inflammation at mucosal surfaces, was demonstrated in those infected patients, especially in the severe group. Furthermore, similar tendency was also presented in na\u00efve regulatory T cells, which underlie the control of systemic and tissue specific autoimmunity. It has been shown that T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in weakening or dampening overactive innate immune responses during viral infection [18] . Whereas, regulatory T cells, a subset of T helper cells, play a crucial role in negatively regulating the activation, proliferation, and effector functions of a wide range of immune cells for the maintenance of self-tolerance and immune homeostasis [20, 21] . Given that higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in COVID-19 patients, especially in the severe cases, the consumption of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the decrease of regulatory T cells, presented in our study, might result in aggravated inflammatory responses, the production of cytokine storm and make damaged tissue worse. Although not so sure, correlative evidence from those severe patients with lower number of lymphocytes suggested a role for dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. 15 There were several limitations in our study which might make some potential bias. First, it was a retrospective, single center and small sample study of patients admitted to hospital; standardized data for a larger cohort would be better to assess the temporal change of immune response after infection with COVID-19. Second, those patients with COVID-19 who have bacterial co-infection or superinfection might affect the results of immune response. Most of them presented the increase of NLR and procalcitonin, and more evident in severe cases, indicated potential bacterial co-infection due to dysregulated immune system.",
