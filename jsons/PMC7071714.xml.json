Staff, however, increased monitoring when certain problems were detected, such as when the baby\u2019s heart was not beating normally, when progress of labour was slow and when oxytocin was used to increase contraction. Putting up a screen for privacy was done in about half of all vaginal examinations. In most cases, women were not informed of the findings after an examination. Main reasons for birth attendants being unable to follow their clinical guidelines were that they are too few. Thus an investment in sufficient and competent workforce in such labour wards is crucial.",

Although childhood mortality has been reduced significantly, Millennium Development Goal 4 was not met in Sub-Saharan Africa, as neonatal deaths went mostly ignored and now make up 40% of under-5 mortalities [1, 2]. Almost half the number of stillbirths and 23% of neonatal deaths in LMICs are intrapartum-related, in contrast to high-income settings [3, 4]. Hence, ending intrapartum deaths by improved quality of intra-facility care is pivotal [5]. Yet, in Sub-Saharan Africa, the increasing numbers of facility-based deliveries, have not resulted in better intrapartum care and progress to improve perinatal health outcomes is slowest [6\u20138]. Instead, in many facilities, international standards of intrapartum care have become more difficult to implement in the day-to-day reality. As found in our hospital, after unrealistic international guidelines were adapted to better suit the local resource-limited reality, significant improvements were observed in quality of care, stillbirths were reduced by one-third and the number of neonates with birth asphyxia nearly halved (Box 1) [9].",

However, written records (e.g. partographs) in low-resource settings are often incomplete, missing or inaccurate [10], and therefore might not reflect the actual care. The gold standard for clinical quality assessment is direct observation that captures the real-life experiences and behaviour of birth attendants; yet, they are rarely used [10, 11]. Similarly, few studies have assessed the adequacy of intrapartum foetal monitoring in low-resource settings [12\u201316]. This study used continuous direct observation to assess the quality of intrapartum care, with a specific focus on foetal monitoring and the structural requirements to delivering intrapartum quality care.",

At the time of the study, the labour unit consisted of an admission room, a one-room labour ward with 19 beds, a three-bed delivery room, two postnatal rooms, and one theatre (Fig. 1). For privacy reasons, women were not allowed to have a companion during childbirth in the busy labour ward. Skilled birth attendants (SBAs) comprised 27 nurse-midwives (diploma-level in nursing, except three seniors with university-level degree), 13 resident doctors (general doctors) and six intern doctors (total n = 46) who together provided routine labour care and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care. On average, six to eight nurse-midwives and five doctors were allocated to the maternity unit in the morning shifts and a total of six SBAs were in the remaining shifts (including weekends). These were the main roles of nurse-midwives: assessment on admission; intrapartum and postpartum care including supportive care, routine monitoring, administration of medication, vaginal deliveries, and perineal repair; maintenance of ward hygiene, and delivery sets. The roles of the doctors involved providing labour and postpartum care to high risk women and complicated deliveries and performing obstetric and gynaecological operations. Direct supervision was provided by two senior midwives and two senior (visiting) doctors, only during morning shifts. In addition, there were three obstetricians who could be consulted and called for emergencies (Additional file 2, cadre definitions). Standards for labour management was according to the peer-reviewed PartoMa Pocket Guide version 1.2 [9]. where, in collaboration with the SBAs, international guidelines had been tailored to the situation at the hospital, including reductions in information load, ambiguity, and frequency of clinical assessments (Additional file 3, comparison of FHRM recommendations) [9]. The stillbirth rate was 39 per 1000 total births, of which 38% occurred during intra-hospital care [9].\n",

Predictors were adopted from the NICE [19] and local PartoMa guidelines, and from the hypothesis that they would alter the frequency of observations and/or the quality of care. Adherence to FHRM guidelines meant that the number of FHRMs was at least equal to the expected frequency. Expected frequencies of FHRM for low-risk labours, high-risk labours, and non-reassuring/abnormal FHR were set at 60, 30, and 15 min, respectively [9]. These were based on first stage of labour guidelines, because the start of second stage was often unknown. Other variables recorded consisted of socio-demographic characteristics, risk assessment variables (Box 2), cervical dilatation, and FHR on admission (Additional file 4).\n",

They worked in pairs and observed a maximum of eight labouring women at a time. Also, the presence of observers could have altered the behaviour and improved performance of the SBAs (the Hawthorne effect) [20].

Means were reported with standard deviations (SDs), medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs), and frequencies with percentages. Then, the proportion of observations adhering to local FHRM guidelines, privacy standards and communication practices were calculated using the following formula: number of observations divided by number of expected observations, given the duration of labour. Four intervals were calculated: between two adjacent FHRMs, vaginal examinations, contractions and the last FHR-to-delivery interval. Differences between work shifts (day/evening/nights) were tested using one-way-ANOVA for the number of staff, equipment and labouring women and chi-square test for composite adverse perinatal outcomes (i.e. stillbirths and Apgar score < 7 at 1 min). Furthermore, univariate and multivariate generalized linear models for Poisson distributions were performed with the number of FHRMs for each woman as an outcome to estimate the effect of the above-mentioned pre-selected predictors on local guidelines adherence. In the multivariate analysis, the predictor intrapartum risk event was dichotomised. Results from the analysis were reported as rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals and corresponding p-values. For this study, a RR may be interpreted as the increase in the number of FHRMs either compared to a reference category or when a continuous predictor increases by one unit. The set frequency of FHRM was hourly and women with a total pre-delivery observation of less than one hour were excluded from this analysis. The statistical software used was SPSS version 23, and SAS 9.4.

            "text": "We here report the labour observation aspect of a broader work that included an ethnographic study and a locally co-created intervention to improve quality of labour care. Measurement of the quality of labour care is essential for identifying gaps, developing context-tailored interventions and monitoring of quality improvement processes. This unique systematic observation of intrapartum routine care overcomes the shortcomings of records-based studies in assessing quality of care. It allowed evaluation of the interactions between labouring women and their birth attendants, and the structural context care was provided in. The findings are supported by record-based quantitative PartoMa findings and also by mainly qualitative findings that showed similar suboptimal structural challenges to processes of care in numerous areas across Sub-Saharan Africa and other low resource-settings [12, 29\u201331]. However, observations are more resource-consuming than record-based assessments, hold a higher risk of the Hawthorne effect, and may pose ethical dilemmas about the non-participatory nature of the observer and their moral responsibility to participant safety in understaffed settings. Thus, a trade-off of biased results for participant safety may be necessary. As the observers were not qualified birth attendants, they expressed any concerns on patient safety, including imminent delivery, to the staff on duty and in emergency situations, they assisted the staff when requested. Observations show it was common practice for birth attendants to wait until signs of imminent delivery before attending to women in the second stage of labour. Thus a few women delivered unattended, as a result of preventable delays to respond to women\u2019s call for help and not the mere absence of skilled birth attendants from the labour ward.",

Also, the study aimed to measure and identify challenges, rather than detect differences in outcomes for varying quality of care. Hence, it was still unable to determine the effect foetal monitoring has, if any, on birth outcomes [16]. The results should then lead to adequately-powered studies including clinical auditing in other LMICs to estimate the quality of the intrapartum (foetal) monitoring and linking it to birth outcomes. Moreover, we were not able to determine the effect of staff experience and time of day on the quality of care as women were cared for by several birth attendants across multiple shifts. The admission assessment was retrieved from the patient file and not observed. Numerous findings on admission which included smaller-than expected fundal height, undiagnosed twins, breech presentation, and intrauterine foetal death until close to delivery indicate inadequate risk assessment and suggests admission time as an important point for improvement to explore.",

It was not possible to provide respectful and safe care, and even to optimally follow locally adapted clinical guidelines, which took the local resources into account.
