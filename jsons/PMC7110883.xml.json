In addition to these technical advances, the list of respiratory and opportunistic viruses linked to documented cases of lower respiratory tract disease in immunocompromised hosts has been extended over the last years 6, 7, 8. These developments have led to an increase in the number of diagnosed infections in HSCT recipients with ARF that would have previously been diagnosed with a noninfectious post-HSCT lung injury syndrome. In fact, a study was able to identify pathogens in more than half of the cases previously diagnosed with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome using molecular and nonculture tests for a wide array of pathogens on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples [9]. Still, situations remain where noninfectious post-HSCT lung injury syndromes become the diagnosis of exclusion [10].",

Their prevalence thus appeared somewhat higher than previously reported in noncritically ill HSCT recipients with pulmonary infiltrates (10% to 30%) 20, 21 or in the general population of critically ill immunocompromised patients (30%) [22]. Importantly, probable invasive aspergillosis occurred despite standard prophylaxis and almost universal anti-mold coverage at the time of BAL in several of our patients, and at least 2 of these cases were associated with genotypic azole resistance of the respective strain. Insufficient drug levels during azole therapy may also have led to breakthrough infections [23], but the respective data were not available for analysis. Regarding non-Aspergillus mold infections, a significant proportion of patients (11%) suffered from an invasive mucormycosis. Broad anti-mold antifungal is a known risk factor for this condition [24], although other risk factors, such as preceding graft-versus-host disease, older age, disease relapse, or profound neutropenia, have also been taken into account [25]. In our cohort we found an association with mucormycosis only for both of the latter, but statistical power of the analysis was limited. Emerging azole resistance and an increasing number of non-Aspergillus mold infections have previously been described in HSCT recipients 26, 27, and our findings probably outline this increasing complexity of fungal infection patterns in the HSCT population. Ultimately, their distribution may have clinical implications regarding regimens of antifungal prophylaxis and empirical therapy and the timing of BAL in nonintubated patients, because noninvasive tests (eg, galactomannan) fail to identify cases of mucormycosis or azole-resistant Aspergillus strains [3]. However, further studies in that respect are warranted. Importantly, even within this cohort with high baseline immunosuppression, evidence of impaired immune reconstitution as indicated by low absolute lymphocyte counts and high-dose corticosteroid therapy helped to identify individuals at the highest risk for invasive fungal disease.",

Although this cut-off was recently established to support the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia in the context of HSCT [13], only very few of these patients had a respective clinical diagnosis documented. However, even in the absence of overt disease, subclinical CMV infection in the lungs has been shown to produce significant biologic effects such as inflammation and fibrosis [28]. Similar considerations apply for the 12% of our patients with the finding of 1 or more viruses of uncertain lung pathogenicity. Although several of these viruses such as HHV-6 [6], human coronavirus [7], or HRV [8] are increasingly recognized to cause lower respiratory tract disease after HSCT, evidence accumulates for a variety of subclinical pathogenic processes to be induced in the lungs upon infection with these viruses 29, 30. Although more research on these host responses is needed, studies including newer antiviral agents and focusing on preventive strategies in patients with asymptomatic shedding or upper respiratory tract disease are already ongoing [31]. Given the inferences from the high rate of polymicrobial findings in our patients (see below), these strategies may be more suited to improve outcomes than interventions in patients who already developed ARF, and we support further such studies.",

Previous exposure to antibiotics as well as hospitalizations would have been other variables of interest in this context, but we could not obtain the respective data.

This is probably because clinicians attributed lung injury patterns to specific pathogens according to the patients' history, clinical assessment, and radiographic findings [4]. However, both clinical assessment and radiographic findings lack specificity in many instances 33, 34. On the other hand, as outlined above for CMV, microbiologic findings may still be significant even if they do not seem to account for the predominant pattern of lung injury 28, 29. Hence, the mutual interaction of pathogens or their inherent pathogenicity acting as competing conditions could be a significant promoter of lung injury in these patients. In both cases the observation of frequent polymicrobial findings would be important, because it reduced the chance of any single pathogen-directed intervention to be successful, either in clinical practice or in clinical trials.",

Furthermore, the inability to identify the cause of ARF in hematologic patients is an independent factor associated with mortality [35]. Although the analysis of outcome measures was not the scope of our study, the finding of increased mortality in patients with a detected pathogen was therefore surprising. However, a similar observation was made in the study of Seo et al. [9]. Three factors may have accounted for this observation. First, invasive fungal infections are associated with excess mortality of up to 90% in HSCT recipients 2, 22, and our detection rate was high. Indeed, only 1 patient with an invasive fungal infection in our cohort survived to ICU discharge. Second, even with respect to HSCT, patients in our cohort were highly immunosuppressed, most having been on multiagent immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids, and having shown very low absolute lymphocyte counts [36]. Detection of a pathogen may therefore have been deleterious in these patients with significantly impaired infection control capabilities, especially if regarded as a possible consequence of high pathogen burden. Third, patients with a detected pathogen were more severely ill than those without. However, this may have been regarded either as a consequence of the respective pathogen(s) or as a factor having influenced detection rates in our patients [37].",
