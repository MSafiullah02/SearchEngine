They have also been controversial because of the very real possibilities of contamination of the human food supply with vaccine-producing transgenic plants, and because of concerns around the possibility of immunological tolerance developing to oral or edible vaccines. However, one set of problems that many foresaw\u2014regulatory and production problems\u2014has not eventuated, and in fact the environment now seems primed very favourably for their introduction.",

However, the first proof of efficacy was done using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing whole VP1: parenteral immunisation of mice with leaf extracts elicited antibodies that bound to VP1 and to intact FMDV particles, and all immunised mice were protected against virulent FMDV challenge (Carrillo et al. 1998). The Wigdorovitz group went on to demonstrate that mice could be protected against FMDV challenge after oral or parenteral vaccination with extracts of transgenic alfalfa expressing VP1 (Wigdorovitz et al. 1999), or immunisation with leaf extracts of tobacco plants expressing VP1 via a recombinant Tobacco mosaic virus vector (Wigdorovitz et al. 1999). A refinement of these achievements included transgenic expression in alfalfa of amino acid residues 135\u2013160 of VP1 (VP135-160) fused to glucuronidase (GUS), which both allowed selection of strongest expressers by assay of enzyme activity, and was protective in mice (Dus Santos et al. 2002). Another novel application of carrier technology was the insertion of VP1 amino acids 140\u2013160 (G-H loop) in an interior region of the hepatitis B virus core antigen gene (HBcAg), and expression of the chimaera in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum. The chimaeric protein formed virus-like particles (VLPs) in the tobacco leaves, and mice immunised intraperitoneally with a soluble extract were protected against viral challenge (Huang et al. 2005).",

Soon after, the same group went on to express PA in transplastomic N. tabacum, with significant yield increases but still no efficacy trial (Aziz et al. 2005). Another investigation of transplastomic tobacco by Henry Daniell\u2019s group was more thorough: yields were high (2.5 g/kg in fresh leaf tissue), the protein was protected in chloroplasts from protease cleavage and was stable when stored in leaves or as crude extracts, and was biologically active (Watson et al. 2004). While they did not show immunogenicity or protection, the authors speculated that \u201cWith an average yield of 172 mg of PA per plant using an experimental transgenic cultivar grown in a greenhouse, 400 million doses of vaccine (free of contaminants) could be produced per acre\u201d. The Daniell group subsequently showed that chloroplast-derived PA was equal in potency to the natural product from B anthracis, and that mice immunised subcutaneously with partially purified chloroplast-derived PA with adjuvant produced high IgG titres and survived challenge with lethal doses of toxin (Koya et al. 2005).",

The antibody neutralised toxin activity both in vitro and in vivo at a comparable level to hybridoma-produced antibodies. The Yusibov group at what became Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology later used the same transient expression technology to separately express artificial antigens comprising domain 4 of PA or domain 1 of B anthracis lethal factor (LF), fused in-frame with lichenase (LicKM), a thermostable enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum (Chichester et al. 2007). Mice immunised with a combination of the two antigens produced high titres of mainly IgG1, and sera could neutralise the effects of anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) in vitro.",

Fusion antigens assembled in potato tubers into cholera holotoxin-like structures that bound enterocytes, and elicited serum and intestinal antibodies after oral immunisation in mice. Moreover, passively immunised mouse neonates were partially protected against diarrhoea after rotavirus challenge, demonstrating that combination vaccines for viral and bacterial pathogens may be made in plants. A simpler approach to rotavirus prevention was expression of a His-tagged VP8* fragment of bovine rotavirus (BRV) VP4 in N. benthamiana via recombinant TMV, purification of the antigen by Ni2+ chromatography, and intraperitoneal immunisation of adult female mice (Perez Filgueira et al. 2004). Eighty-five percent of suckling mice born from these mothers were protected from BRV challenge, compared to 35% immunised with an irrelevant control antigen. The same group also showed that a fusion protein made in transgenic alfalfa consisting of a short peptide derived from BRV VP4 fused to GUS was immunogenic both when given intraperitoneally and orally to adult female mice, and their sucklings were protected against challenge (Wigdorovitz et al. 2004). Another group used transgenic alfalfa to produce human rotavirus VP6, and showed that female mice gavaged with alfalfa extract containing oligoCpG as an adjuvant developed high titres of antibodies both systemically and mucosally, and their pups were partially protected against simian rotavirus challenge.",

Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), the cause of the famous \u201cjackalope\u201d sightings in the USA, provides an excellent model system in domestic rabbits for investigation of prophylactic and therapeutic papillomavirus vaccines (Breitburd et al. 1997). Accordingly, in the first study CRPV L1 major capsid protein-containing extracts were prepared either from transgenic N. tabacum or N. benthamiana infected with recombinant TMV, and used with Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant to immunise rabbits that were subsequently challenged with live virus (Kohl et al. 2006). Although the vaccines appeared to contain small aggregates of CRPV L1 rather than intact VLPs, and immune rabbit sera failed to neutralise CRPV infectivity in an in vitro assay, the rabbits were protected from wart development (Kohl et al. 2006). In the second study, infectious recombinant TMV was used to surface display, via fusion to the capsid protein, a peptide consisting of amino acids 94\u2013122 of the L2 minor capsid protein from either CRPV or the Rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV) (Palmer et al. 2006). Groups of rabbits received either or both vaccines, and were challenged with live CRPV or ROPV. Immune rabbit sera reacted with whole L2 protein, and CRPV-specific sera neutralised CRPV pseudovirion infectivity. Rabbits receiving the CRPV or CRPV + ROPV vaccines were completely protected against CRPV infection, and those receiving ROPV alone were weakly protected against CRPV. These studies demonstrated for the first time that plant-made papillomavirus vaccines based on L1 protein or L2-derived peptide had real potential as prophylactic vaccines, for use in animals as well as in humans. Strangely, given that Bovine papillomaviruses (BPV) had been used for many years as model systems for anti-wart vaccination, it was not until 2012, with transient agroinfiltration-mediated expression of BPV-1 VLPs in N. benthamiana, that a candidate plant-made BPV L1 VLP-based vaccine was successfully made, although no efficacy trials were done (Love et al. 2012).",

Another report followed in 2002 on the expression in maize seed of the S envelope protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) of swine, and its protective efficacy in piglets fed with the seed (Jilka 2002). This followed an earlier demonstration of oral immunogenicity of the S protein N-terminal domain in transgenic potato tubers (Gomez et al. 2000). Rabies too was a target for maize seed expression, with a report of G protein expression in transgenic maize seed to 1% of total soluble protein, and complete protection in a heterologous rabies strain challenge of mice orally immunized with one dose of ~50 \u03bcg of G protein in seed extract (Loza-Rubio et al. 2008). The same group later showed that sheep orally given a single dose of the transgenic maize seed containing ~2 mg of the G protein were protected to the same extent as those immunized with a commercial inactivated vaccine (Loza-Rubio et al. 2012). The authors claimed that \u201cthis is the first study in which an orally administered edible vaccine showed efficacy in a polygastric model\u201d, which was an important development.",

We have also used the Zera tag as a protein body display vehicle for an ectopic M2e moiety common to all influenzavirus A types, which could serve as a universal vaccine for these viruses (Mbewana et al. 2015). Another potentially veterinary use of Zera was in the enhancement of Yersinia pestis F1-V antigen fusion protein accumulation: this was ~3\u00d7 higher than F1-V alone in three different host plant systems\u2014namely, N. benthamiana, alfalfa and N. tabacum NT1 suspension-cultured cells (Alvarez et al. 2010).",

            "text": "The expression vehicles themselves have also been subject to engineering: it is now possible to precisely control glycosylation of plant-made proteins. This can be done by knock-out modification via RNA interference (RNAi) technology of the plant glycosyltransferases beta1,2-xylosyltransferase (XylT) and core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucT). These enzymes are responsible for the transfer of beta1,2-linked xylose and core alpha1,3-linked fucose residues to glycoprotein N-glycans, which are plant-specific modifications not found in mammalian glycoproteins (Strasser et al. 2008). It is also possible to use transient co-expression technologies to modify glycosylation (Castilho and Steinkellner 2016), as well as to achieve almost completely native sialylated recombinant proteins by expression of whole mammalian glycosylation pathways in plants (Castilho et al. 2010; Steinkellner and Castilho 2015). It is possible to abolish N-glycosylation entirely, by co-expression of bacterial PNGase F (Mamedov and Yusibov 2013). One can also control endogenous plant proteases that may limit recombinant protein accumulation: for example, transient co-expression of secreted A1/S1 protease inhibitor tomato cathepsin D inhibitor (SlCDI) significantly lowered A1 and S1 protease activities in the N. benthamiana apoplast, while increasing recombinant protein content by ~45% (Goulet et al. 2012). It was found that co-expression of tomato cystatin SlCYS8, which inhibits C1A proteases, increased the transient expression yield of a monoclonal antibody in N. benthamiana by nearly 40% (Robert et al. 2013). It is also possible to reduce protease activity in cell suspension cultures by expression of specific antisense RNAs, resulting in significantly increased accumulation of recombinant antibodies (Mandal et al. 2014).",

Use of flow cytometry with cell sorting, formerly the province of mammalian cell culture work only, has allowed high-expressing MAb-producing tobacco BY-2 cell lines from a heterogeneous population of cells by selecting the co-expressed fluorescent marker protein DsRed (Kirchhoff et al. 2012). However, one of the most exciting recent developments with this technology is the advent of the \u201ccell pack\u201d: this is a technique for getting highly efficient (up to 100%) Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation of suspension-cultured cells that have been captured by suction onto a filter (Rademacher 2014). Cell packs can be tiny (Eppendorf tube tips) or large (e.g.: centimetres deep in a 20 cm Buchner funnel); protein expression occurs in immobilised cells in the presence of minimal liquid media, and can continue for days (https://tinyurl.com/k22da6q). The technology is ideal for rapid and high-throughput screening of expression\u2014and the possibility exists for taking cells back into culture and selecting for permanent transfection. These are important developments, because of the acceptability of the products of plant cell cultures for production of biologics to regulatory bodies (see below). Another production host highly suited to industrial-scale production is microalgae: they are easier to establish and use than plant cell cultures, and share all the same advantages of scalability, contained growth, and consistent transgene expression levels (Specht and Mayfield 2014).",

A useful development was use of a transgenic N. tabacum/N. glauca hybrid that does not synthesize alkaloids, is highly vigorous, can easily be propagated by vegetative cuttings and does not produce viable pollen, which greatly aids biocontainment (Ling et al. 2012). The application of techniques more familiar to chemical engineers is also advantageous: for example, it proved possible, by sequential use of fractional factorial designs and response surface methodology, to optimize culture media for MAb production in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells, and to increase MAb yields up to 31-fold after 10 days of culture compared to use of standard media (Vasilev et al. 2013). The Fraunhofer IME group have described generic chromatography-based strategies focusing on the binding behaviours of host cell proteins to chromatography resins under varying conditions of pH and conductivity (Buyel and Fischer 2014). Another useful technique from that group is a comprehensive description of the use of heat treatment of either intact leaves or of plant extracts to facilitate the industrial-scale removal of host cell proteins, optimised by a design-of-experiments approach that will also be familiar to engineers (Buyel et al. 2016). Many of these and other strategies used to optimise yields in molecular farming are reviewed here (Twyman et al. 2013).",

It is possible to efficiently make bacterial proteins using bacterial-derived translational machinery in chloroplasts in transplastomic plants, as well as to make other proteins at very high yield; conventional transgenics have been used to make many vaccine candidates, with many proofs of efficacy; transient expression technologies have revolutionised the field in terms of providing high yields and very rapid development times from concept to product.

However, perhaps developments from the human field could be used as a spur for uptake of veterinary vaccines and biologics: an example here is the licencing of Protalix Biotherapeutics\u2019 Elelyso\u00ae or glucocerebrosidase, a therapeutic for a genetic mitochondrial enzyme deficit called Gaucher disease, made using transgenic carrot cell lines in 800 litre plastic bag fermenters (http://protalix.com/about/elelyso/). A contamination of Genzyme\u2019s mammalian cell production facilities in 2009 with a mammalian calicivirus led to the FDA allowing Protalix to supply the drug to patients who needed it, and to accelerated licensure (Bethencourt 2009). The company has also successfully tested oral administration of drugs in plant cells, which would be a highly welcome development: they claim that \u201cOral delivery of protein therapies [is] possible due to the unique cellulose wall of plant cells that makes them resistant to degradation when passing through the digestive tract\u201d (Protalix 2017). Another apposite example was the fortuitous availability of a plant-made anti-Zaire ebolavirus MAb cocktail known as ZMapp\u2122, at the height of the recent West African Ebola disease outbreak (reviewed in Rybicki 2014). This was made by transient expression in N. benthamiana, and only a few clinical trial doses were available: these were used under the humanitarian principle, and later the MAbs were cleared for use by the FDA in an efficacy trial just before the end of the epidemic (LeafBio 2016).",

The irregular occurrence of outbreaks, and the limited number of strains involved, mean that stockpiling vaccines is desirable. However, killed vaccines still require growing potentially dangerous viruses, and while it is possible to make VLPs in cell cultures and these are effective (Pearson and Roy 1993; Roy et al. 1994), the technology is too expensive for farm animal use. It is fortunate, therefore, that it is also possible to make BTV-8 VLPs via transient expression in N. benthamiana, and these are as effective in a single injected dose as the commercial vaccine (Thuenemann et al. 2013). There are currently no plans to manufacture this or other plant-produced BTV vaccines for the European or other markets; however, this may soon change.",

While some recent work in this area has shown that recombinant CP can be made in E coli and in insect cells (Heath et al. 2006; Patterson et al. 2013; Stewart et al. 2007), that it appears to be protective (Bonne et al. 2009) and that this can apparently form VLPs (Sarker et al. 2015), it still appears that the protein is too expensive to produce for use as a vaccine. While initial work with plant production of BFDV CP was disappointing due to low yields, recent work from our group (Duvenage et al. 2013) showed a significant increase in BFDV yield due to fusion with elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), and good immunogenicity in mice. This, coupled with a very simple purification protocol enabled by ELPylation (Conley et al. 2009), could allow scalable, cheap production of BFDV vaccines.",

These and other experiments are reviewed here (Juarez et al. 2016; Topp et al. 2016), in articles that make an excellent case for plant-made immunotherapeutics for veterinary use.",

Framework I vaccines are used to protect humans and economically valuable animals, where neither are central to the transmission cycle: a good example here would be West Nile virus, which is a mosquito-borne flavivirus spread around the world by birds, and which incidentally infects animals like horses as well as humans. Framework II vaccines, on the other hand, are intended for use in domesticated animals as a means of preventing disease in both animals and humans: examples of disease agents here would be Brucella abortis, E coli O157, and rabies, influenza, Rift Valley fever, and Hendra viruses. Framework III vaccines are for immunising non-domesticated animals in order to prevent transmission of disease agents to humans and domesticated animals: examples here are the use of oral bait rabies, and Mycobacterium bovis and Lyme disease vaccines.",

The unique mix of hosts that occurs in intensive agricultural environments that could give rise to pandemics\u2014swine, birds and humans\u2014is a major cause of international concern; so too is the development of suitable vaccines for the prevention of infection in domesticated birds, farmed swine, and humans. Plants have been shown to be highly useful for the production of influenza vaccines, and indeed possibly the fastest ever production at scale of an influenzavirus A strain vaccine\u20141 month for 10 million doses\u2014was done by Medicago Inc. for H1N1pdm 2009 HA VLPs in 2012 (Rybicki 2014). Medicago also managed in 2013, as an exercise to demonstrate preparedness, to produce grams of cGMP-grade plant-made H7 HA-only VLPs only 19 days after accessing the H7 HA gene cDNA sequence, in response to an outbreak in China in the same year. The fact that plant-made influenza vaccines have worked very well in animal models means that they should be trialled extensively in domestic fowl and swine, to see if the maintenance of the viruses in these hosts can be curbed. As for companion animals, there is even a canine influenza vaccine candidate: following a 2004 H3N8 outbreak in the US, a group in Canada used the plant-derived filamentous Malva mosaic virus (MaMV) nanoparticles as a vaccine platform to display the highly conserved ectopic M2e peptide and to increase its immunogenicity. Together with the adjuvant OmpC derived from Salmonella typhi, the vaccine was protective against both the homologous virus and a heterosubtypic strain of influenza in mice, as well as eliciting antibodies reactive with M2e peptides derived from H9N2, H5N1 and H1N1 strains and being immunogenic in dogs (Leclerc et al. 2013).",

The protein yield was 1\u20132 mg/kg fresh plant weight. Transgenic material was orally immunogenic, and elicited humoral and mucosal antibody responses, and antibodies bound inactivated virus used as a vaccine booster in some experiments. Agroinfiltration-produced GnGc was used as a reagent in ELISA to detect immune responses. Another study from our group was of the production of CCHFV N protein in N. benthamiana by agroinfiltration specifically as a reagent for use in diagnostic tests (Atkinson et al. 2016): a plant codon-optimised and 6xHis tagged N protein gene was found to accumulate best as a soluble protein in the cytoplasm, from which it could be easily purified by ammonium sulphate fractionation and immobilised Ni2+ column chromatography. Purified NP was used in a validated indirect ELISA to detect anti-CCHFV IgG in sera from convalescent human patients: this was successful for 13/13 samples, with no readings for samples from patients with no history of CCHFV infection. The results were 100% concordant with those from a commercially available immunofluorescent assay. Given that soluble N protein is hard to produce and difficult to purify from insect cell cultures, the plant-made product would seem to be a desirable replacement.",
