            "text": "As of April 27, 2020, more than two million people worldwide have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with Europe being one of the current major clusters of the pandemic. 1 Despite an absence of evidence, children have been targeted as a potential source of children-to-adult virus dissemination, and schools have been closed in most countries. However, findings seem to indicate a lower susceptibility of children to COVID-19 and low contagiousness. 2 Within 7 days of imposed population quarantine in France (initiated on March 17, 2020), we observed an increase in number of young infants with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In our paediatric hospital, patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms, or both, and requiring admission to hospital are admitted to a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 infection unit. During the first week of quarantine, 14 infants younger than 3 months were admitted to this unit, and five of these young infants were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the basis of nasopharyngeal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2. Their clinical presentations differed from those reported in articles about children with COVID-19, 3,4 which present little data from younger infants.",

Cerebrospinal fluid samples were normal and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The infants received no drugs other than acetaminophen. Their clinical course was rapidly favourable, which allowed hospital discharge 1-3 days after admission. A dedicated paediatrician supervised the followup, which consisted of a daily phone call using a standardised questionnaire for 2 weeks.",

Although infants might initially present signs of severe infection, our experience is that the youngest children tolerate and rapidly improve from COVID-19, in contrast to adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19. However, because little is known about SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants, 4,6 close monitoring is required for at least 2 weeks after the diagnosis. All of the infants' parents showed mild signs of viral infection (ie, rhinitis, or cough or fever, or both, for <1 week), which could be related to undiagnosed COVID-19.",
