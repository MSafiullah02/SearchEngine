No definite cellular receptor for vaccina virus has been identified. Confocal microscopy has shown that IMV and EEV enter cells by different mechanisms (11) . Both attach to cells via different proteins allowing the virus to enter by membrane fusion. The IMV envelope proteins A17L, A27L, and D8L may be instrumental in viral attachment. The D8L protein was one of the earliest IMV membrane proteins identified and is thought to mediate IMV binding to cell surface chondroitin sulfate (12, 13) . The A27L protein may mediate vaccinia attachment through cell surface heparin sulfate; this was shown by demonstrating a 60% viral inhibition in the presence of soluble heparin sulfate (7) . The EEV is the infectious form responsible for cell-cell transmission in vivo. To date, 6 EEV specific membrane proteins (A33R, A34R, A36R, A56R, B5R, and F13L) have been identified (1) . It has been found that the A56R protein can be mutated without affecting infectivity (14) .",

            "text": "Like all poxviruses, vaccinia spends its entire life cycle within the cytoplasm of the host cell and does not integrate into the host genome (see Fig. 1 ). Because of its ability to rely on its own encoded proteins for life activities, the virus can rapidly and efficiently replicate without restrictions from the host cell defense. Following entry into the cell, vaccinia releases enzymes required for the initiation of early transcription. The virus then undergoes a process of early DNA uncoating and initiates early transcription. Early, intermediate, and late transcription utilize each its own specific promoters and transcription factors. Within 4 to 6 h of infection there is almost complete inhibition of host protein synthesis allowing for efficient expression of viral genes and replication (8) . In the initial early phase a DNA dependent RNA polymerase is released from the virus into the cytoplasm, which induces the transcription of early mRNA. Translation of the mRNA forms early proteins, which are involved in the uncoating and replication of the viral DNA. These early proteins also induce the transactivation and transcription of intermediate messenger RNA (mRNA). Intermediate mRNA encodes for late transactivators leading to late mRNA synthesis. The proteins synthesized in the late phase of viral replication constitute membrane structural proteins and early transcription factors and enzymes that will be incorporated into new viral particles. The relatively small number of proteins required for DNA synthesis make the system very simple and self-sufficient (1, 2, 16) . Ten thousand copies of the viral genome are created within 12 h of infection, half of which are incorporated into mature virions and released (8) .",

These crescents are composed of a single lipid bilayer, which has no contact to the cellular membranes and viral protein, however, the source of the lipid bilayers remains, so far, enigmatic (18) . The crescents then coalesce into a noninfective form of immature virus. Only after condensation of core proteins and the addition of two additional membranes do these virus precursors become IMVs. The necessary membranes are derived from modified trans-Golgi network membranes. Further modifications entail the inclusion of virus-encoded proteins into these membranes, which then become part of the outer envelope of the EEV. Once the viruses are fully wrapped they move to the cell surface where the outer membrane fuses with the plasma membrane, exposing the mature virus on the cell surface.",

The gene of interest is flanked with a few hundred pairs of viral DNA derived from the insertion locus of the parental virus. The new recombinant arises when homologous recombination takes place between the viral sequences in the transfer plasmid and the parental virus. Another approach involves in vitro ligation of a foreign gene into the vaccinia virus genomic DNA (21) . The third approach employs the viral genome as part of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The rVV containing BACs allow the generation of mutant or recombinant viral genomes in bacteria, without the need for recombination or plaque purification in mammalian cells (22) .

The transfer plasmid contains the foreign gene expressed from a vaccinia promoter and flanked by vaccinia DNA sequences. Care should be taken to ensure that the foreign gene of interest should not contain the vaccinia transcription termination signals for early promoters (TTTTTNT) (24) . The most common site of recombination has been the vaccinia thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Insertion of genes into the TK locus eliminates functional viral TK and leads to attenuation of the virus in normal tissues in vivo (24) . Recombination into other loci has also been performed, including intergenic DNA segments, such that no functional deletion occurs (25, 26) .",

Following late gene expression, previrion forms assemble to form the IMV. The IMV is targeted to the trans-Golgi Network(TGN) and following envelopment, the IEV is formed. IEV's are propelled to the cell surface by the polymerization of actin filaments. Once released, the virus may remain attached to the membrane as a cell associated enveloped virus (CEV) or be released into the medium as an extracellular enveloped virus (EEV).

Although specific T-cell immune responses were generated and the regimen was well tolerated, there were no positive clinical responses noted (56). Rochlitz et al. published their phase I trial of a modifed vaccinia (MVA strain) expressing human MUC1 for antigen specific immunotherapy in patients with advanced MUC 1 positive cancers (60). They found that patients tolerated repeated doses of the virus with minimal side effects and 1 of the 13 patients with advanced cancer showed a marked decrease in the size of his metastasis that lasted 14 mo. Greiner et al. developed a vaccinia expressing a triad of costimulatory molecules including B7.1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and leukocyte function-associated antigen-3 combined with CEA to produce a vaccine against CEA expressing cancers. This virus, known as rV-CEA TRICOM or a recombinant vaccinia vector that carries a triad of costimulatory molecules, has been encouraging in preclinical studies and is now the focus of clinical trials(57).",
