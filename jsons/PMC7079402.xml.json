Patients who develop moderate-to-severe ARDS in the ICU have a worse prognosis compared to mild ARDS patients, including increased mortality rates (48% vs. 29%), impaired functional recovery, compromised quality of life and cognitive dysfunction [6]. Severe trauma definitely remains a significant risk factor for hypoxaemia, implicating both direct and indirect lung injuries [7]. Notwithstanding improvements in prehospital care, resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, the incidence of hypoxaemia in trauma patients has remained consistently high during the last 30 years [8\u201311]. In the most severely injured trauma patients (Injury Severity Score (ISS) [12] above 15) requiring blood transfusion, the incidence of hypoxaemia may exceed 40%. Indeed, a recent analysis of the PROMMTT registry underlines that the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia could be as high as 45% [13]. In trauma patients, ARDS increases the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, incidence of ventilation-acquired pneumonias, healthcare-associated costs and mortality [14].",

Whatever the mechanism implicated, inflammation is a key player [17\u201319]. Indeed, tissue injury triggers a massive and short-lived release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [20], which bind both Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [21] and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) [22, 23], which recruit and activate neutrophils, resulting in a widespread systemic inflammatory response [24].",

Indeed, NETosis refers to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), composed of a backbone (decondensed chromatin fibres) coated with antimicrobial granular and cytoplasmic proteins, such as myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase (NE) and \u03b1-defensins [32, 33]. The detrimental effects of excessive NET release are particularly important to ARDS, because NETs can expand more easily in the pulmonary alveoli, causing extensive lung injury [33] and hypoxaemia. Moreover, while unbound NE is usually rapidly inactivated when released into plasma, DNA-bound NE is protected from neutralization by plasma [34].",

Indeed, dornase alfa was shown to reduce trauma-induced lung injury in mice [37], to fight against sepsis-induced ARDS [38, 39] and to reduce mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury [40], which are traditional \u201csecond hits\u201d for lung damage in ventilated trauma patients.

In the model, the entire set of these variables will be added and, secondly, selected using stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) [53]. In such a model, the prior distribution on each parameter is a mixture of two mean 0 normal distributions, one with low variance and the other with high variance: if the posterior weight on this second normal is strongly around 0, then the prior on the parameter is essentially driven by a normal distribution whose mean is centred on 0; this is the clue for a \u201cnon-significant\u201d parameter.",
