We are writing this article during the first period of lockdown in the UK and being \"responsible citizens\" by complying with the social distancing measures. Whilst academics like us are still busy with our usual research activities, we are learning to adjust to a new reality and way of work (and life, though the boundary is diminished during lockdown) with online meetings with colleagues, research students, and of course quite 'dauntingly' online teaching. What is more, we have to do this with little prior warning or training. Probably one of the most important ways to cope with this lockdown to avoid any deterioration of mental and physical wellbeing is to take advantage of the situation to reflect on something that we cherish the most in our research, in our case corporate social responsivity (CSR) and marketing.",

Notwithstanding the human tragedy of lost lives, broken families, and scarred communities, the economic and social changes caused by a pandemic-driven lockdown will constitute a cultural legacy which will live long in our memories and those of future generations. The pain is personal, emotional, psychological, societal, economic, and cultural; and it will leave scars. In many regards, we view Covid-19 as analogous to that which Taleb (2008) calls a 'Black Swan Event' -a shocking event that changes the world (as similarly also noted concurrently by a number of authors and editorssee for example Grech, 2020; Mazzoleni et al., 2020) .

That is, after shocks that change culture happen, people within those shocked culture almost immediately rationalize such events by reflecting that they could have been predicted and probably avoided. Is Covid-19 an example of this -we think so? After Covid-19 the world will not be the same and notwithstanding numerous apocalyptic movies, conspiracy theorists, and political opportunists, we cannot but help to hope that future pandemics can be avoided if we learn the lessons, we cannot help but think should have been learned before And the impact of Covid-19 on global economy is likely to be unprecedented since the 1930s Great Depression (Euronews, 2020) . Therefore probably the Covid-19 pandemic represents one of the most significant environmental changes in the modern marketing history, which could potentially have a profound impact on corporate social responsivity (CSR), consumer ethics, and the basic marketing philosophy. The short-term impact of Covid-19 is immediately and effortlessly felt, due to the widespread lockdown and social distancing measures globally. However the pandemic will end, it is already set to have longlasting profound economic, social, political, and cultural impacts. In this paper, we discuss some preliminary ideas on how this pandemic can influence the field of CSR and marketing philosophy. In terms of CSR, we will discuss its impact on CSR opportunities and trends, and consumer ethics. In terms of marketing, we will focus on its potential implications on the core marketing concepts, the context of marketing, and marketing strategy.",

Inevitably this crisis has put companies under test for its commitment to ethical business conduct and CSR. Some may argue that the financial strains, both short-term and long term, caused by the outbreak could significantly pushed firms to pursue short-term gains, sometimes even through fraud and misconduct, and reduce long-term CSR investment, probably due to lack of slack resources and mounting pressure for survival.",

Probably the more relevant and pressing question is not about whether to invest in CSR or not, but more about how to invest in CSR to achieve the mutually beneficial and interdependent social/environmental and economic goals.

The general narrative is that Covid-19 does not discriminate in terms of the medical fact that people from different demographic backgrounds are equally susceptible to the illness. However, Covid-19 does discriminate as there are growing data showing that people from BAME backgrounds are more likely to contract the virus and become seriously ill or even die from it (Booth, 2020; Butcher & Massey, 2020) . Many explanations beyond medical terms have been offered. Most of these explanations speak to the truth that there is still higher level of inequality in the developed world in terms of wealth, health, education, and so on. This offers significant opportunities for CSR. Companies should focuses more of their efforts on tackling social issues on these fronts during this pandemic as well as in the long-run. The United Nation (UN) has made a call for efforts to build more inclusive and sustainable post Covid-19 economies that are more resilient in facing global challenges, such as pandemics, climate changes, and others, instead of going back to the world as it was before (UN.org, 2020).",

Personal factors can include consumer personality traits, moral values, moral identity, implicit morality beliefs, and so on. Situational/contextual factors can be issue characteristics, social influences, group and intergroup dynamics, and so on. The Covid-19 pandemic, as an unprecedented situational and contextual factor, has significant implications for the understanding on consumer ethical decision making during the pandemic as well as potentially post-pandemic in the long run. During the pandemic, numerous consumers are grounded to their homes with limited external access except the internet, due to lockdown and other social distancing measures. Consumer decision making can be irrational during crises like current pandemic, as evidenced by stockpiling of food, medicines, hygiene and sanitation products, and even toilet papers all over the world. Some might argue that, panic buying (incl. stockpiling) is the perfectly rational consumer behaviour during crises like this with a significantly high level of uncertainty (Lufkin, 2020) . Nevertheless, it seems that consumer decision making is currently driven purely by self-interest and emotions, such as fear, anger, and anxiety. This has forced the supermarkets to take measures such as rationing and designating opening hours for key workers and seniors. On the other hand, consumers have exhibited many altruistic behaviours during the pandemic, including resisting panic buying and buying groceries for vulnerable residents (e.g., over 70s)(Guardian, 2020).",

Although responsible and prosocial consumers will become a larger consumer segments, the pandemic will cultivate a different consumer segment that focuses on instinct hedonic gratification. Covid-19 pandemic is a collective traumatic event for many consumers, causing them physical, psychological, and emotional distresses and harms. Some consumers can respond to it with a coping strategy that heightens urgency to pursue the pleasant experience of satisfying their emotional and sensory needs. Delaying gratification in this regard will be seen as less desirable due to higher level of perceived uncertainty about the future.

Given that tourism sector accounts for 10% of the world GDP and jobs, the impact on ethical consumer behaviour cannot be ignored (Weforum.org, 2020) . The immediate impact is unprecedentedly severe with most airplanes grounded, tourist sites shut, and hotels/restaurants closed, due to the social distancing measured introduced globally. However, what are the medium-term and long-term impacts? In the medium-term, there could be a surge in consumption, when consumers cannot wait to get out of their homes and visit places, travel, and dine outside. An alternative forecast is that there might be a slow return, due to prolonged consumer fear of the virus and health and safety concerns. A more important question is how does the pandemic shift responsible and sustainable tourism and travel consumption? During the post-pandemic era, will consumers restrict their travel either for leisure or business? How would restricted travel negatively impact on those firms and people traditionally relying on the prosperity of this sector? Would consumers need to resort to their own moral judgements when deciding whether, when and how to travel? Given that a lot of us has to our surprise found and pleasantly experienced the effectiveness of online meetings and conference calls, it would be highly possible that many of us will try to keep this newly found treasure by restricting business travels. On the leisure front, similarly it is likely that more people will, before booking the next travel, ask questions such as whether that travel is essential and what are the local and domestic alternatives, as more people are moving towards more responsible and sustainable consumption.",

Will consumers generally become more health-consciousness in their product choices? Given the strong evidence that health and fit people are less likely to be severely ill with the virus (O'Connor, 2020), we expect a strong shift towards health and wellness consumption, not only in the food and nutrition sectors, but also in the fitness sector.

Marketing is grounded in the philosophy and ideology of the marketing concept wherein we endeavour to identify and respond to the needs and wants of targets markets better than competitors (see for example Kotler et al. 2019 ). More enlightened and progressive commentators and organizations have espoused variations of the societal marketing concept; wherein organizations balance short-run consumer wants with the long-run welfare of society (see Kotler and Zaltman 1971; Kotler et al. 2019 ).

However, mid-pandemic consumers were not driven by considered evaluations of varying brands or by long-run value or by future loyalty reflexions but were frustratingly constrained by limited choice, product accessibility, and immediate demand. In some regards, rather than marketing myopia (Levitt, 1960) where marketers over-focus on the physical characteristics of their products they shortsightedly overlook customer latent needs, the Corvid pandemic was more the case of consumers' pandemic-driven tunnel vision of panic buying and hoarding (Lewis, 2020) while, possibly, in the future, marketers will be rebuked and castigated for their of hypermetropia (the opposite of myopia) during such crises for failures to focus on the want satisfying attributes of their products.

Such exchange pivots on shared agreement, perceptions of value, and communication -each of which was radically altered for many buyers and suppliers during the events of Covid-19. The dominance of face-to-face interactions and exchange which was (in many contexts) slowly being eroded by online exchange was suddenly severely curtailed by many governments with online exchange suddenly dominant.

Communication means between buyers and suppliers immediately changed as lockdowns were imposed and travel restricted.

Prior to lockdowns grocery retailers in particular had unprecedented sales while online entertainment and connectivity organizations thrived on massively increased demand. Other sectors the like housing and automotive industries were hit extremely hard and the rebound and waves of fluctuating demand and supply will likely continue for many years. Politically, almost all countries saw sweeping changes to ideologies that severely imposed on previously-cherished doctrines of freedom of movement and market-economics amongst many others.

Technologically, while politicians hailed the Internet as a lifesaving medium (quite literally in virus-tracking countries -particularly in Asia) (The Japan Times, 2020), the adoption of technology to replace face-to-face interaction was widespread.

What was a very fast growing medium was (at least briefly during lockdown situations) totally dominant (or, at least, prevailing). All industries and sectors found the change instantaneous and profound. Whether this change merely accelerated an on-going trend or is reversible is debatable. Industries that previously pivoted on face-to-face interaction found ways and means to engage (and survive) via online means and it seems likely that much of this change will settle (see for example .",

For decades organizations have persuade globalization with much scholarly and practitioner comments on the need of local responsiveness and glocalization (see for example Crawford and Chin 2015) . However, the pandemic proved most challenging for global firms; global supply changes stopped, international campaigns faltered, and worldwide initiatives simply vacillated, stuttered, then lurched to a standstill. Consumers previously clamouring for globally-renowned brands were constrained to local markets, outlets, and products. Will consumers turn their back on firms and outlets that literally fed them when they were hungry? Possibly. Possibly not? The future seem far less certain than a few short months ago.",

This pandemic offers great opportunities for firms to actively engage in various CSR initiatives during the crisis, and potentially catalyse a new era of CSR development in the long run. For consumers, ethical dimension of consumer decision has become salient during the pandemic, which is also likely to shift consumers towards more responsible and prosocial consumption. Such changes seem likely to be mirrored by firms and organizations. Fundamental changes to our lives will affect our beliefs, attitudes, and opinions so that astute marketers will adapt their policies and strategies to reflect. Will there be a long-standing resurgence in the social marketing concept and more responsible business orientations? We hope so. Whatever the changes in seems highly likely that the ways marketing has operated in the past will need to change and will do to meet the new reality.",

Although the immediate impact of Covid-19 pandemic seems to be evident, what could be the long-term impact on CSR and consumer ethical decision making? What are the opportunities and challenges for CSR in the long run post-coronavirus? Will the short-term change in consumer habit leads to long-term sustained shift of consumer ethical behaviour, if yes how? How will Covid-19 change our marketing philosophy? Will an outcome of this pandemic be an increased incorporation of social and societal issues into our driving philosophies? In terms of customer behaviour there is an urgent need to explore how citizens, customers, and consumers responded (both positively and negatively) to varying lockdown restrictions. Changes to behaviours may well be evident (such as the move to online shopping and entertainment) but alterations to attitudes, values, beliefs are likely to be subtle. Similarly, while Covid-19 drove sector, firm, and organizational innovation, research is need to explore the drivers of effectiveness and to detail which changes will prove beneficial in the long term.",
