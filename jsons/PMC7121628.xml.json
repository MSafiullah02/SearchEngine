In ancient times, asthma had been described as follows:\nIf from running, gymnastic exercises, or any other work, the breathing becomes difficult, it is called Asthma; and the disease Orthopnoea is also called Asthma, for in the paroxysms the patients also pant for breath. (The Extant Works of Aretaeus, the Cappadocium), and more recently, in the words of Thomas Willis in his Pharmaceutice Rationales in 1679, as possessing the following features:an Asthma, either meerly pneumonick, preceeding altogether from the passages bringing in aire being obstructed, or not enough open; or it is meerly convulsive, which only arises by reason of a defect or fault in the motive organs\u2026The ancient Physicians, and for the most part hitherto the Moderns have only acknowledged the first kind of Asthma, judging the next cause, and almost the only cause of this Disease, to be the straitness of the Bronchia\u2026The straitness of the Bronchia, including the first kind of an Asthma, is supposed to come to pass by an obstruction, as often either thick humours and viscous, or purulent matter or bood extravasated, are forced in upon them.\n\n",

It is estimated that over 5% of the global population has asthma, which translates to a staggering 350 million people worldwide (1). It is more common in developed countries, where incidence rates can run as high as 20%. The incidence has also been increasing, first in developed countries, and now in developing nations. Mortality rates of asthma show no significant improvement despite the development of new drugs and strategies to treat asthma. Yet for a disease that affects so many people, there is no single diagnostic test available, and the ability to make a diagnosis depends solely on the clinical skills of the modern day physician. It is a huge challenge. We recognize now that asthma is not one disease, but a heterogeneous group of disorders. Making a diagnosis of asthma involves a thinking process that incorporates so many factors, both genetic and environmental, that patients are frequently misdiagnosed. Two people can present to the physician with an identical clinical presentation, and only one will leave with a diagnosis of asthma. How is this possible? The answer can be found in the realization that clinical symptoms that we commonly attribute to asthma are not pathognomonic of the disease, and many other conditions can cause symptoms such as cough, wheezing, or respiratory distress.",

Modern pathological and laboratory techniques have allowed us to study the diseased airways in asthmatics. The early descriptions noted above describe an \u201cobstruction,\u201d and even as recently as 30 years ago, our belief was that asthma was a condition primarily of bronchoconstriction. We now know that bronchoconstriction is more likely a result or epiphenomenon of changes that occur at the cellular level that lead to inflammation of the airways, characterized by smooth muscle hypertrophy, increased vascular permeability and mucous production. These are the known histological events of inflammation, which then lead to the hallmark physiologic features of inflammation \u2013 heat, erythema, swelling, and drainage. All of these have been shown to occur in the asthmatic airway. The clinical results of these inflammatory changes are cough, wheezing, respiratory distress, inadequate oxygenation of blood and clearance of carbon dioxide, respiratory acidosis and potentially, death. If the changes are chronic, then there can be permanent damage to the structure of the airway epithelium, a process loosely known as \u201cairway remodeling,\u201d leading to the development of an irreversible process more closely resembling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema.",

One of the ways to approach this is to study the differential diagnosis of individual common asthma symptoms separately, such as cough, wheezing, and respiratory distress. For example, what is the differential diagnosis of a cough? Asthma certainly is high on the list, but other possibilities can include infectious diseases, such as viral respiratory infections, bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis or fungal infections, neoplasms, foreign body inhalation, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux and many others. Of course, a more complete history and physical will help to rule out diagnoses until one has no other possibility left other than asthma. Similarly, a differential diagnosis for wheeze can include asthma, but also congestive heart failure, transmitted sounds of upper airway congestion or obstruction, tracheal anomalies, vascular rings, vasculitides and vocal cord dysfunction. Respiratory distress could be a result of a chronic lung condition, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, smoke inhalation, congestive heart failure, respiratory muscle weakness, or a metabolic problem. Again, sorting out the clinical history and physical to come up with the most likely diagnosis depends on the clinical skills of the physician. Table 1 provides a more complete differential diagnosis.\n",

Within the initial wheezing group, a subgroup of children with severe wheezing was additionally formed at 10 years of age in 1965. These groups have been followed at 7-year intervals since. The last published review comprised data up until 1999, when the participants were on average 42 years of age (3). Throughout the study, the individuals who were initially classified as having mild or severe asthma continued to have consistently decreased FEV1/FVC ratios when compared to the control group. Interestingly, these individuals\u2019 decreased FEV1/FVC ratios were established at 7\u201310 years of age and remained decreased at 42 years of age. Of note, the respective decreased FEV1/FVC ratios were at their lowest at the 10 years of age mark, and did not worsen (relative to the control group) with progression to adulthood despite continued symptoms of asthma. In the second cohort asthma study, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, 1,139 children were enrolled at birth and followed at 2- to 5-year intervals, from 9 to 26 years of age (4). A total of 613 individuals were able to provide respiratory assessment at every time point. Persistent wheezing individuals (those reporting wheezing at all survey time points) and relapse wheezing individuals (those reporting wheezing at two or more consecutive survey points, followed by one or more survey points without wheezing, and finally reporting wheezing at all subsequent follow ups) had reduced FEV1/FVC ratios in comparison to children without wheeze. Similar to the Melbourne Asthma Study, this reduction was initially seen at 9 years of age when the initial FEV1/FVC evaluation was preformed. In all groups, there was no difference in the slopes of change in FEV1/FVC ratio as would be expected with increasing age. Interestingly, the reduced FEV1/FVC ratios of the persistent and relapse wheezing individuals, in relation to the nonwheezing and mild wheezing individuals, generally followed the same trend showing very little deterioration, from 9 to 26 years of age. Both studies contribute to the hypothesis that the insult, which results in reduced FEV1/FVC ratio in asthmatic individuals, occurs at a very young age.",

Strunk et al. have reported that children, enrolled in CAMP, with mild to moderate asthma have airway obstruction at 6 years of age and increased airway obstruction at 18 years of age (5). The study included 1,041 children with mild to moderate asthma from CAMP, compared with 5,415 children without asthma, from the Harvard Six Cities Study (H6CS). Strunk et al. used FEV1/FVC ratios, a reliable assessment of airway obstruction, and found that in male children with mild to moderate asthma FEV1/FVC was \u22127.3% at 6 years of age and \u22129.8% at 18 years of age compared to age- and sex-matched controls (5). Female children with mild to moderate asthma had FEV1/FVC of \u22127.1% at 6 years of age and \u22129.9% at 18 years of age compared to age- and sex-matched controls (5). The findings are significant for showing over 70% of obstruction existed before 6 years of age and a progression of obstruction from 6 to 18 years of age. This disagrees with the Melbourne Asthma Study and the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, and may be due to an increased number of participants. The Melbourne Asthma Study had 372 participants with asthma and 105 control participants without asthma, while the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study had a total of 613 participants finishing their study.",

These tests are conducted by a trained technician and the response in pulmonary function to escalating doses of methacholine is measured. The doses of methacholine used generally ranges from 0.02 to 25.0 mg/mL, and are usually given in doubling doses. The most recent ATS recommendations define two different methodologies: the 2 min tidal breathing method and the 5 min dosimeter method. Dosing starts low, at about 0.03 mg/mL, and increase to a maximum dose of 16.0 or 32.0 mg/mL. Spirometry is performed after each incremental dose is administered, and a 20% drop in FEV1 at any time signifies a positive test. The PC20 FEV1 is the provocative concentration of methacholine that will result in a 20% drop in FEV1. If this drop occurs at a low dose, such as 2 mg/mL, then this is a positive test for asthma, but if there is no drop or the drop occurs at a very high dose, e.g., 32 mg/mL, then this indicates a negative test for asthma. If a drop occurs, the patient should be given bronchodilators to ensure that pulmonary function returns to normal.",

These include cigarette smoking, viral infections, exposure to occupational sensitizers or allergens, exercising or the use of bronchodilators, or consumption of foods that can facilitate bronchodilation such as caffeine, prior to the test. Moreover, the test is dependent on the proper technique in performing spirometry; otherwise, the test results will not be valid. Therefore, even methacholine challenge testing cannot be deemed to be 100% diagnostic for asthma, but should be viewed as a very valuable tool in helping to establish the diagnosis of asthma, while taking into context the clinical presentation of the patient. Methacholine challenge testing is indicated when the probability of asthma as the correct diagnosis is assessed to be between 30 and 70% (6).",

This has been a very controversial topic because there are other conditions that can cause an increase in FeNO, including viral infections or atopy.

Eosinophil cationic protein has been investigated as a marker for airway inflammation in asthma. It was demonstrated that serum ECP is elevated in patients who are undergoing an acute asthma exacerbation, when compared to stable asthmatics or controls. As in the case of FeNO, ECP appears to be more useful as a tool to monitor asthma status, rather than providing any significant value into the diagnosis of asthma.

In turn, this remodeling leads to airway wall thickening/airway narrowing, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, hypersecretion of mucus, and airway edema. Saglani et al. have recently reported compelling findings in children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years (7). Endobronchial biopsies were taken from 16 \u201cconfirmed wheezers\u201d (video questionnaire), 14 \u201creported wheezers,\u201d and ten controls (nonasthmatic children presenting with stridor). \u201cConfirmed wheezers\u201d had significantly thicker reticular basement membrane and significantly greater eosinophilic inflammation, compared to controls. Prior to this study, Saglani et al. examined endobronchial biopsies in 53 infants between 11.5 and 12.4 months of age (8). Infants with decreased specific airway conductance with bronchodilator reversibility and infants with decreased specific airway conductance without bronchodilator reversibility were compared with age-matched controls. Interestingly, no difference was found in reticular basement membrane thickness or inflammatory cell number. Taken together, these studies suggest the possibility that there may be a \u201cdevelopmental window of susceptibility\u201d (9) for asthma between infancy and 5\u20136 years of age. This age is of particular interest because it typically is the period of time when the usual trigger for wheezing in children is respiratory infection, likely caused by viruses. It has been proposed that this typical wheezing pattern seen in some children may be due to an inappropriate inflammatory response to normally innocuous viral infections. This inappropriate response could possibly lead to airway remodeling and subsequent asthma.",

It is believed that many of the approximately 11 million asthma exacerbations that occur each year in the United States are triggered by viral infections (13, 14). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) techniques have demonstrated that up to 80% of asthma exacerbations in children and 76% of asthma exacerbations in adults are due to viral respiratory infections (13, 15, 16). Viruses associated with asthma exacerbations include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza, parainfluenza, and coronavirus (Table 2) (13). Interestingly, wheezing and infections by RSV, RV or hMPV early in childhood have been associated with the development of asthma later in childhood (13, 17\u201320). This may reflect the previously mentioned potential \u201cdevelopmental window of susceptibility\u201d (9), when a specific infection results in the development of asthma.

Bronchiolitis due to RSV is the most common cause of wheeze in infants and young children (13, 21). Studies of children hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis with wheeze have reported an increased risk of wheeze or asthma at least through the preteen years. Sigurs et al. prospectively studied 47 children who had been hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis, and compared them with a group of 93 sex, age, family history for reactive airway disease or atopy, and generally living environment-matched controls (22). At 13 years of age, the children who had previously suffered RSV bronchiolitis had more than a fourfold greater chance of developing wheeze/asthma (43 vs. 8%) (22). Stein et al. prospectively studied 888 children who had a history of lower respiratory tract infections due to various agents within their first 3 years (23). Of this group, 207 children had a history of lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV. These children had a significantly increased risk of wheeze at 6 years of age, but this risk declined at 11 years of age, and was not significant at 13 years of age (23). Additionally, at 11 years of age, force expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was measured in 110 of the children with a history of lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV. When compared to controls, these children had FEV1s which were significantly reduced, but normalized when treated with salbutamol.",

In this study, RV infection was also significantly associated with smoking and nonuse of inhaled corticosteroids (29). Experimentally, Grunberg et al. have shown similar actions of RV infection in individuals with mild atopic asthma (30). Intranasal infection with RV16 (a major subgroup of RV) in adults with mild atopic asthma resulted in significant symptoms of asthma, significant symptoms of common cold, and significantly decreased FEV1 at 2 days postinfection, when compared to placebo-infected controls with mild atopic asthma (30).",

Interestingly, increased IL-8 levels on day 2 post-RV16 infection significantly correlated with increased airway responsiveness (histamine provocation) on day 4 post-RV16 infection (31). de Kluijver et al. found increased IL-8 levels in the nasal lavage of asthmatic individuals, but not nonasthmatic individuals after RV16 infection (32). Additionally, he found that the pro-inflammatory mediator IL-1\u03b2 was produced in both asthmatic individuals treated with placebo and asthmatic individuals treated with budesonide and then infected with RV16 (32). Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) was increased only in the asthmatic individuals treated with budesonide and then infected with RV16 (32).

Children sensitized to perennial allergens (house dust mite, dog, and cat dander) on ImmunoCAP (Phadia, Freiberg, Germany), and exposed to high levels of the respective allergens within the first 3 years of life, had significantly reduced lung function (FVC and maximal expiratory flow at 50% [MEF50], measured by body plethysmograph) at school age, when compared to nonsensitized children or sensitized children who were exposed to less allergen (44). Interestingly, sensitization and exposure to perennial allergens at older ages had weaker effects, and sensitization and exposure to seasonal allergens (mixed grass and birch pollen) were not significantly relevant (44). In this same study, 90% of nonatopic children with wheeze lost their symptoms by school age and had normal lung function at puberty (44). Previously noted, Jackson et al., who found an association of wheezing due to RV at 3 years of age and a diagnosis of asthma at 6 years of age, also found an association of aeroallergen sensitization and asthma at 6 years of age. Prospectively following 259 children in a high-risk birth cohort (one parent with respiratory allergies and/or a history of asthma diagnosed by a physician), they found that aeroallergen sensitization independently increased the risk of asthma at 6 years of age (26).",

The incidence of late-onset asthma, defined as asthma occurring after age 65, is between 60 and 100/100,000. Symptoms of asthma in the elderly are similar to those in other age groups, with wheeze, phlegm and cough being the most common. Asthma in the elderly is associated with a female predominance and less atopy or allergic diseases.

This condition can lead to severe asthma exacerbations when patients are exposed to aspirin, and can even include anaphylaxis or urticaria. Treatment is by aspirin desensitizations, and there are standard protocols available for performing aspirin desensitization safely and with optimal effectiveness.

Type 1 brittle asthma has a maintained hypervariability in PEFR, while type 2 patients experience sudden attacks of airway obstruction. While the triggers for brittle asthma have not been delineated, proposed risk factors include female gender, food intolerances, psychological disorders, a reduced perception of airway compromise, atopy, reduced total lung capacity, reduced hypoxic drive, and the presence of neutrophil-associated airway inflammation (47).

In our analysis of the various phenotypes of asthma, we attempt to isolate common themes or features that will allow us to simplify the definition of asthma. These features can include clinical findings or histological abnormalities, and would certainly include characteristics of an inflammatory disease. The involvement of cellular and humoral elements of the immune system in asthma can also vary widely from patient to patient. There is clearly a genetic element in asthma, as the incidence of asthma in children born to parents with asthma is greatly increased. A unifying definition of asthma, as we know asthma to be in the present day, may look something like this:\nAsthma is a heterogeneous group of disease characterized by inflammatory changes in the airway, leading to bronchial obstruction, which results in respiratory symptoms and signs of varying character and severity. Asthma is typically but not universally recurring in nature, and is under the influence of genetic, immunologic and environmental factors that are not all known at the present time.\n",
