            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is a member of the circovirus family, it is the smallest virus amongst the animal viruses, is nonenveloped, and the genome is a single strand of circular DNA (Tischer et al., 1982). However, only five virally encoded proteins (Rep, Rep\u2019, Cap, ORF3, and ORF4 proteins) have been identified in PCV2 replication: ORF1 encoding Rep and Rep\u2019 protein is associated with viral replication; ORF2 encodes the major immunogenic molecule, the Cap protein; ORF3 is associated with PCV2-induced apoptosis in infected cells (Juhan et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2005). PCV2 is the pathogen that causes postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and results in great economic losses in swine farms worldwide (Segales et al., 2005). Infection by PCV2 is usually accompanied by multiple system diseases (Darwich and Mateu, 2012, Meng, 2013), especially involving lymphoid organs, which further lead to immunosuppression (Lee et al., 2010). However, the pathogenesis and replication mechanisms of PCV2 have not yet been fully understood. So, this poses a great difficulty in the prevention and treatment of PCV2.",

Vimentin together with microtubules and microfilaments form a cytoskeleton network, ensuring that the organelles and nuclei of cells remain in a stable cell space. Vimentin is mainly located in the cytoplasm, especially around the plasma membrane. However, vimentin is also found to be expressed on the cell surface. In addition to maintaining cell integrity, vimentin also could function in cell adhesion and migration, apoptosis, and genomic DNA expression (Eckes et al., 2000, Ivaska et al., 2007, Nieminen et al., 2006). In addition to the internal effects in cells, vimentin also has an important role in the invasion step of infection by various viruses. Evidence is growing that vimentin plays an important role in the replication of several viruses, such as: affecting the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus by interacting with the 2C protein (Gladue et al., 2013); as a receptor for enterovirus 71 (Du et al., 2014); modulating infection of dengue virus replication (Teo and Chu, 2014).",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of vimentin in PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells. We used eukaryotic expression vectors and interfering RNA, as well as NF-\u03baB signal pathway experiments, to study this role.

After transfection of the plasmid, we examined the mRNA and protein levels at 24, 48, and 72 hpi after PCV2 infection of the cells by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and IFA.

We further studied the effect of vimentin on the replication of PCV2 by investigating the interaction and co-localization of vimentin with Cap protein during PCV2 replication using immunofluorescence assay. Vimentin was localized via confocal microscopy by using rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma). It can be seen from the figure (Fig. 4\nA) that there was a significant co-localization of the vimentin and virus Cap protein at 48 hpi. The vimentin filaments existed around the nucleus in the virus uninfected group, and the filamentous vimentin was clearly gathered together after 48 h in the PCV2-infected group compared with the uninfected cells group, and may form a special structure that influences PCV2 replication. This phenomenon coincides with the vimentin aggregation in early cell apoptosis. Therefore, it was deduced that the vimentin effect on PCV2 replication may be related to apoptosis. To further investigate the interaction between PCV2 Cap and vimentin, we conducted an immunoprecipitation experiment. The results showed (Fig. 4B) that Cap protein was immunoprecipitated with antibody against vimentin (Fig. 4B, lanes 7, 8, and 9), and vimentin was detected in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-Cap antibody (Fig. 4B, lanes 4, 5, and 6) after 48 and 72 hpi.

The results from the protein level analysis (Fig. 5B) showed that the level of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB P65 and I\u03baB\u03b1 in the overexpression group was significantly lower than that in the empty vector control group.

However, the pathogenesis of PCV2 is not fully understood. Binding to host cell surface receptors is an important step in viral infection, so finding and identifying viral receptors is a promising strategy for controlling numerous viral infections. Vimentin is part of a cytoskeleton structure that has the role of a receptor for virus entering the cell, especially as a viral receptor or attachment receptor. For example, the direct interaction between vimentin and SARS-CoV spike protein during viral entry and as the virus enters the receptor (Yu et al., 2016). Cell surface vimentin is an attachment receptor for enterovirus 7 and increases the infectivity of EV71 (Du et al., 2014). However, vimentin also plays an important role in multiple processes of viral infection. Vimentin acts as a restricting factor in HPV replication (Schafer et al., 2017). Our previous report showed that vimentin was down-regulated in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells in the later stage of infection by using an iTRAQ labeling approach, but the specific mechanism involved has not been studied. In the case of PCV2, vimentin is not a receptor that adsorbs virus, proven through our vimentin antibody incubation experiments, but rather acts as a restricting factor down-regulating PCV2 replication. Regardless of the mRNA level or protein level, when we overexpressed the vimentin by transferred pCAGGS-vimentin recombinant plasmid, the replication of the PCV2 was reduced. The opposite effect was seen when we used interfering RNA to inhibit the expression of the vimentin, by transferred siRNA-vimentin, the replication of the PCV2 increased. It showed that vimentin acts as a restricting factor in the process of PCV2 replication.",

In our results, the NF-\u03baB P65 protein was up-regulated and the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein was down-regulated during the PCV2 infection. Furthermore, in the vimentin overexpression group, we found that NF-\u03baB P65 and phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 proteins were down-regulated compared with the control group from the protein and mRNA levels. This was indicative that vimentin is involved in the replication of the PCV2 by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

            "text": "The physical interaction of co-localization of PCV2 and vimentin in PK-15 cells was observed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assay. Confocal microscopy revealed a significant co-localization of the PVC2 Cap protein and the vimentin after 48 hpi. In addition, there was an interaction between the vimentin and the Cap protein when PCV2 was infected with PK-15 cells, as determined by immunoprecipitation assay after 48 hpi. Meanwhile, after 48 h of infection with PCV2, filamentous vimentin protein was gathered together around the nucleus and may form a special structure affecting the replication of the PCV2. In addition, when cells are infected with African swine fever virus and iridovirus frog virus 3, the intracellular vimentin is gathered around the virus. This \u201ccage-like\u201d structure plays an important role in viral replication (Murti et al., 1985, Stefanovic et al., 2005). Here, the vimentin interacts with some protein of the virus to increase viral replication. However, in our study, the vimentin may form a special structure around the virus that restricts the replication of PCV2. There may also be a close relationship with apoptosis. PCV2 infection of PK-15 cells can cause apoptosis; in particular, it causes caspase-3 activation (Liu et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2017). However, the theory that PCV2 causes apoptosis is controversial. Apoptosis was shown not to be a significant feature of lymphoid lesions when PMWS occurs after infection with PCV2 (Resendes et al., 2004), but PCV2 apoptosis in other organs is important, such as in hepatocytes (Sinha et al., 2012). In our study, RT-qPCR and caspase-3 activity assay showed that PCV2 activated caspase-3 and induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells. Meanwhile, the activity of caspase-3 in the vimentin overexpression group was significantly higher than that of the control group at 48 hpi. In our confocal experiments, we found that when PK-15 cells were infected with PCV2, vimentin was aggregated. Vimentin is also aggregated at the time of early cell apoptosis. This is indicative that vimentin up-regulates PCV2-induced apoptosis and enhances PCV2-induced caspase-3 activity. This is also the likely reason for the down-regulation of PCV2 replication caused by the overexpression of vimentin.",

PCV2 is one of the major pathogens affecting swine farms worldwide, but the effect of vaccines is limited. Clearly, there is a need to identify other ways to prevent and treat PCV2 infection in order to reduce the losses caused by the virus. By studying vimentin as a restricting factor for PCV2 replication, a drug for the prevention and treatment of PCV2 could be developed according to its specific molecular structure.",
