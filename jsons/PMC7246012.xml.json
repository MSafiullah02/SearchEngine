On day 72, the COVID-19 had already spread to 113 countries or territories in five continents, resulting in 118,319 confirmed cases all over the world2. While the epidemic of COVID-19 is slowing down in China, there is active community transmission in Europe and North America, resulting in 30% of disease burden is outside China2. Overwhelming number of COVID-19 infections could not only paralyze the healthcare system, but more importantly, result in nosocomial outbreak, associated with increased morbidity and mortality of the hospitalized patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). Up to 24 February 2020 (day 56), NHCPRC reported that 3,387 healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19, resulting in 22 (0.6%) deaths3. This has exceeded the number of HCWs death due SARS in mainland China after 6 months in 20034. In Hong Kong, eight HCWs succumbed as a result of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV5. The top priority of our pandemic preparedness is to achieve zero COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Hong Kong.",

Of 386 healthcare workers (HCWs) infected with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong, 8 of them (2.2%) succumbed. Six HCWs (2 doctors, 1 nurse, and 3 healthcare assistants) of 8 were the employee of Hospital Authority, the governing body of all 43 public hospitals, divided into 7 cluster-networks, responsible for 90% of inpatient service in Hong Kong. A \u201cSelect Committee to inquire into the handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak by the Government and the Hospital Authority\u201d was established by the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China to in order to examine the performance and accountability of the Government and Hospital Authority and their officers at policy-making and management levels7. The report includes temporal sequence of events and daily statistics on SARS patients with breakdown by healthcare workers and patients. The information is retrieved for analyzing the epidemiology of SARS in 20038. When a novel coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 emerged 17 years later, Hospital Authority immediately activated our response plan to combat the epidemic and to prevent nosocomial transmission and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. The clinical perspective of infection control measures was reported recently9. The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 until 11 March 2020 (at day 72 after the official announcement of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, by NHCPRC in Hong Kong) was analyzed. This is also the date when WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results were compared with the epidemiological data of SARS-CoV at day 72 (11 April 2003) after the official announcement of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province, China on 11 February 2003. In addition, we also compared the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong with Hubei Province, China, which is the most severe affected region by SARS-CoV-2, and the other countries or areas with uncontrolled local transmission at day 72, including Republic of Korea, Islamic Republic of Iran, and Italy, using the publicly accessible information from the WHO website10.",

According to the risk assessment, the response levels can be categorized into alert level, serious response level 1 (S1), serious response level 2 (S2), and emergency response level11. The command structure depends on the different response levels (Figure 1\n). In the alert and S1 level, the response plan is coordinated by ad hoc Central Committee on Infectious Disease and Emergency Responses (ad hoc CCIDER). In the S2 and emergency response level, the governance will be under the command of Central Command Committee, which is chaired by Chief Executive of Hospital Authority, or Emergency Executive Committee, which is chaired by Chairman of Hospital Authority. The response measures at each response level comprises of a series of action, including active surveillance and electronic notification, laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnostic, infection control measures, provision of essential medical services, facility management in the hospital, human resources and staff deployment, staff training, research, and communication. Contact tracing for potential secondary cases was performed to investigate for any possible nosocomial infection as reported previously12\n,\n13.",

Ad hoc CCIDER was regularly held among infection control professionals in 7 cluster-networks and senior management team in the head office of Hospital Authority (HAHO) to review and update the infection control responses so as to disseminate the information to the frontline staff via open staff forum, department visit, right-on-time training of gowning and degowning of personal protective equipment (PPE). Upon receiving the first imported case of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong on day 22, the response level was further elevated to the emergency level on day 26. The Central Command Committee (CCC) composed of the top management team of 7 cluster-networks and HAHO is responsible for the decision for various administrative supports in consultation with ad hoc CCIDER which is responsible for professional advice. Up to day 72, a total of 16 meetings of ad hoc CCIDER were held once every 5 days on average, especially focusing on the evolution of infection control recommendations issued by World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, as well as the scientific evidences published during the evolution of epidemic. CCC was held daily since the activation of emergency level. Hospital Authority has set the priority of service to support the infection control and clinical management against SARS-CoV-2. The elective and non-essential clinical services were trimmed down to reduce the bed occupancies in the hospital. Visitors were prohibited to the hospitals except for compassionate reasons. The utilization of airborne infection isolation room (AIIRs) of 1400 beds in the Hong Kong was closely monitored. The first 20 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 would be admitted to a designated hospital. Subsequently, each cluster-network is required to take care of the next 20 confirmed cases. The major incident control centre of HAHO is responsible for cross cluster-network transfer of confirmed cases. Procurement, distribution, and monitor the utilization of PPE and laboratory reagents for rapid molecular diagnostic among 7 cluster-networks were performed by HAHO and hospital management teams. Accommodation is provided to staffs who are working in high risk areas and isolation facilities during the period of emergency response level.",

It is even more important to perform rapid molecular diagnostic test and isolate patients with SARS-CoV-2 as early as possible. It is the reason why we further extended the scope of active surveillance from hospitalized patients to outpatients who have relatively mild respiratory symptoms, and continue contact tracing for potential secondary cases in order to identify any transmission in hospital and community.
