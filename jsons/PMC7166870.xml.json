Thereafter, from 6 to 14 days of age, a transitional phase from hyperplasia to hypertrophy occurs and this rapid switch is critical for the molecular events behind terminal differentiation and the loss of proliferative ability in cardiomyocytes to take place [Clubb and Bishop, 1984; Clubb et al., 1987]. In agreement with the timing of the rapid switch, our results demonstrated a continuous increase in the expression of IFITM1 from postnatal 7 days and IFITM2 and IFITM3 from postnatal 14 days in rat ventricles. This result is consistent with the differential expression of IFITM1 in fetal and adult heart tissues [Anisimov et al., 2002]. Taken together, interferons are potentially involved in the cell proliferation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes.",

IFITM1 was moderately induced in response to type I interferons but significantly up\u2010regulated by type II interferon. Expression of IFITM3 was notably increased by type I interferons, but did not change significantly when exposed to type II interferon. IFITM2 was non\u2010responsive to both type I and type II interferons. The similar responsiveness of the IFITM proteins towards interferon\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2 supports the notion that interferon\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2 share the common signaling pathways [Mitani et al., 2001].",

IFITM3 was not induced by interferon\u2010\u03b3 in H9C2 cells. However, the transcript level of IFITM3 is increased in the presence of the cytokine in other cell types [Brem et al., 2003]. Such different expression patterns of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in response to interferons in various cell types may be a consequence of cell type specificity to perform specialized physiological functions. However, another possibility of the variations of interferon\u2010stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma\u2010activating sequences in the promoter regions in different species cannot be excluded. Further investigation on the ISRE sequences of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in rats by deletion or mutagenesis would be helpful to determine their importance in the expression of these two genes.",

            "text": "Interferons are cytokines that regulate a variety of biological effects and one of the profound properties of interferons is inhibition of proliferation. The interferon\u2010induced growth inhibition affects different phases of the mitotic cycle, including a block in G1, lengthening of the S phase or a general prolongation of the cell cycle [Sangfelt et al., 1999; Murphy et al., 2001; Vannucchi et al., 2005]. It is not clear which genes are involved in cell cycle control induced by interferons although several studies link the IFITM family to antiproliferative activity. However, the findings are quite controversial. Higher IFITM1 expression has been correlated with improved survival in chronic myeloid leukemia patients [Akyerli et al., 2005]. Downregulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 also correlates with brain tumor progression [Huang et al., 2000]. Notably, overexpression of IFITM1 negatively regulated cell growth, whereas suppression of IFITM1 blocked the antiproliferative effect of interferon\u2010\u03b3 [Yang et al., 2007]. On the contrary, a recent study showed that IFITM gene expression was significantly up\u2010regulated specifically in colorectal tumors and IFITM family proteins may serve as a molecular marker in those tumors [Andreu et al., 2006]. Consistently, the knockdown of IFITM1 inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells [Yu et al., 2010]. Moreover, IFITM1 is able to promote invasion at early stage of head and neck cancer progression [Hatano et al., 2008]. We speculate that the proliferative and antiproliferative effects of IFITM proteins are quite cell type\u2010specific, depending on the differences in interacting partners in different scenarios.",

We further investigate whether interferons elicit inhibitory effects on proliferation in cardiomyocytes. In general, both interferon\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2 remarkably decreased relative BrdU uptakes in the proliferation assay, maximally for 66% and 47%, respectively, while interferon\u2010\u03b3 moderately increased the BrdU uptakes for 20% on average under relatively higher concentrations of the cytokine (20 ng/ml and 40 ng/ml), but not under a lower concentration (10 ng/ml). We also examined the expression level of PCNA after the interferon treatments. In consistent with the observation in the BrdU proliferation assay, interferon\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2 reduced the expression of PCNA. Therefore, these findings further support that the treatment of interferon\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2 decreased cellular DNA synthesis.

Then cDNA synthesis reaction mix, containing 5\u00d7 synthesis buffer, 0.1 M DTT, 4 U Reverse transcriptase (RT), 4 U RNaseOUT was added to RNA and cDNA synthesis reaction was proceeded for 1 h at 55\u00b0C and an heat\u2010inactivation step at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. Then the first\u2010strand cDNA was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.",
