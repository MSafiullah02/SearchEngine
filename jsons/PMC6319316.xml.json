PCSK9 cleaves itself to form the catalytically inactive PCSK9 protein and a prosegment, which remains associated as a complex. The PCSK9-prosegment complex interacts with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), leading to its internalization and degradation. This decrease of LDLR on the hepatocyte surface results in decreased clearance of LDL particles from the circulation.33, 34, 35, 36, 37 Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PCSK9 leading to higher LDL-C levels have been reported to be associated with hypercholesterolemia and with an increased risk of CHD.34, 38, 39 Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, on the other hand, have been correlated with decreased LDL-C and reduced CHD risk. In rare cases, severe LOF mutations that produce no detectable PCSK9 protein have been reported, exhibiting LDL-C levels around 15 mg/dL, and, interestingly, such individuals are identified without negative effects.7, 40, 41 Such individuals validate PCSK9 as a therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention.",

Furthermore, with the recombinant protein therapy approach, numerous repeat administrations are required, which generally come at a high financial cost to the patient. With the DNA-encoded mAb (DMAb) platform it is possible to administer therapeutics repeatedly without facing challenges such as pre-existing immunity, difficult manufacturing processes, or high cost. DMAb technology represents a new approach for a direct in vivo production of biologically active immunoglobulins in a patient in a non-permanent fashion. Low-voltage electropermeabilization allows for robust plasmid DNA delivery into tissue where the delivered plasmid containing an encoded antibody sequence can now drive transcription and in vivo translation of the desired protein. While there have been a few recent reports describing adaptations of this technology as an approach to specific infectious diseases or cancer targets,73, 74, 75, 76, 77 there have not been reports of utilizing this approach for in vivo chronic disease therapy.",

In vivo daPCSK9 plasmid administration using electroporation-enhanced intramuscular injection was performed to evaluate anti-PCSK9 DMAb production kinetics and the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibition on lipid reduction in vivo. Robust production of anti-PCSK9 DMAb began within days of administration, with peak levels of antibody achieved by 1 week post-injection. PCSK9 DMAb could be detected in sera for up to 2 months, and levels could be boosted with additional administrations. In vivo-produced anti-PCSK9 DMAb retained its ability to bind to its target. An increase in LDLR was detected upon in vivo administration and expression of daPCSK9. This was accompanied by significant reductions in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and total cholesterol levels in both C57BL/6 and nude mice studies. These observations support an exciting proof of principle for further study utilizing daPCSK9 DMAb approaches for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.",

A cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in the pVax-1 vector was used to drive the expression of the antibodies, and the final construct was designated MdaPCSK9. At 72 hr after plasmid transfection into HEK293T cells, secreted antibody expression in supernatants was determined to be 831 ng/mL for MdaPCSK9 (Figure 2A). Western blot-binding studies, using supernatants from MdaPCSK9 DMAb-transfected cells, showed specific binding to both human and mouse recombinant PCSK9 antigens, with greater binding detected to human PCSK9 (Figure 2B). This showed proper binding activity of MdaPCSK9 against the PCSK9 antigen. Fluorescence microscopy was also used to demonstrate MdaPCSK9 expression in Hepa1-6 cells (Figure 2C), and it showed a strong expression of MdaPCSK9 in DMAb plasmid-transfected, but not control, pVax1-transfected cells.",

Western blot analysis showed that LDLR expression levels were significantly higher for PCSK9 DMAb-treated mice than control mice. ELISA protein quantification was used to detect the presence of DMAbs in the livers of treated mice. DMAb levels were 185 ng/mg tissue for MdaPCSK9 (Figure 4B). Binding western blot analysis was used to evaluate the binding of DMAbs from serum samples of DMAb-treated and untreated mice to human and mouse PCSK9 protein (Figure 4C). After incubation of the serum samples with blots containing the recombinant mouse or human PCSK9 proteins, the sera of DMAb-treated mice reacted with the PCSK9 protein, but sera from the pVax-1-treated mice did not. Furthermore, MdaPCSK9 were evaluated on a human liver cell line, Huh7; 72 hr after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 4D). There were significant increases in LDLR levels in the MdaPCSK9-treated group, with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) increasing from 1,573 in the control group to 11,166 in the DMAb-treated group. The results demonstrate the functional efficacy of daPCSK9 at inhibiting PCSK9 protein from inducing LDLR degradation in hepatocytes.",

Moreover, they require frequent dosing, such as every 2 weeks used for recombinant anti-PCSK9 antibody therapeutics. Here we developed a novel approach to inhibit PCSK9 using DMAb technology. DMAbs have several advantages that make them an important new technology for the development of protein-based therapeutics, such as cost-effectiveness, ease of manufacturing, stability, and no requirement for a cold chain and rapid development and engineering. DMAbs can be delivered via intramuscular or intradermal routes via in vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA. Low-voltage electroporation leads to consistent intracellular delivery of the injected plasmid DNA. Our DMAb platform has shown protective efficacy against several viral pathogens, including HIV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Zika among others, and it is currently under evaluation for immunotherapeutics against cancers.73, 74, 75, 76, 77",

For DNA delivery, electroporation has been able to allow 1,000-fold enhancement in gene expression in vivo. There have been several impactful clinical studies performed using this in vivo electroporation technology. One example is the human papilloma virus (HPV) VGX-3100 DNA vaccine, which showed efficacy in phase IIb clinical trials, demonstrating robust antigen-specific T cell response, as well as inducing clearance of the HPV virus and lesions.80 Another example is the development of the Zika virus DNA vaccine reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2017.81 In a phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of DNA vaccine GLS-5700, healthy adults demonstrated development of both binding and neutralizing antibodies, associated with protection in animal models.81",

Expression for several months has been demonstrated with several DMAbs, such as Anti-Dengue,73 Anit-Ebola (A.P., unpublished data), and the immunoadhesin eCD4-Ig.82 These studies support the potential of DMAbs, some lasting several months, to be administered as a possible treatment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Here we evaluated the efficacy of the anti-PCSK9 DMAb platform for its ability to express anti-PCSK9 antibodies directly in vivo and to exhibit lipid-lowering properties in mice. An anti-PCSK9 DMAb (MdaPCSK9) that used a mouse-matched backbone was found to express for at least 6 weeks in vivo at reasonable levels. Importantly, inhibition of PCSK9 was observed in vivo, showing elevated liver LDLR expression 5 days after treatment. With a single intramuscular administration of anti-PCSK9 DMAbs (300 \u03bcg plasmid DNA), we observed reductions in non-HDL-C and total cholesterol with both mouse and human anti-PCSK9 antibodies. Significant reductions in non-HDL-C were observed with MdaPCSK9 as early as day 7 post-administration in wild-type and nude mice. Compared to wild-type pVax-1 negative controls, there was a 28.6% reduction on day 7 for the MdaPCSK9 group. Both human and mouse anti-PCSK9 DMAbs led to 30% decreases in non-HDL-C and 14% reductions in total cholesterol by day 14. Wild-type mice, which are normocholesterolemic, were used in the current study, and it is difficult to observe significant decreases in LDL levels in these mice as compared to transgenic hypercholesterolemic mice. Future studies with transgenic hypercholesterolemic mice are important for evaluation of the PCSK9 DMAbs.",
