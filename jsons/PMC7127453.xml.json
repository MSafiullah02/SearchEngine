The antiviral drug ribavirin (1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) 1 was first synthesized in 1972 and has shown broad spectrum antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses.1 Ribavirin has been used clinically in combination with interferon-\u03b1 for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), several viral hemorrhagic fever causing viruses, and recently for SARS CoV infections.2, 3, 4, 5 Side effects, including hemolytic anemia,6, 7 and viral resistance8, 9 are major limitations.",

It inhibits inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase and decreases intracellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentrations.15 This is the predominant mechanism for the antiviral activity of ribavirin against yellow fever, parainfluenza 3, and respiratory syncytial viruses.16, 17, 18 Other mechanisms of ribavirin\u2019s antiviral activity include: (1) inhibition of influenza virus RNA polymerase in vitro with ribavirin triphosphate (RTP),19, 20 (2) inhibition of viral genome capping through interference with guanyltransferase or methyltransferase activity in Sindbis virus,21, 22, 23 and (3) modulation of host immune response in HCV infected patients.24, 25 Recent interest has been focused on increased mutation rates in the viral genome that affect replication, transcription, and virion viability.

Assay conditions consisted of 50 mM Hepes (pH 6.0), 40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1% BSA, 10 \u03bcM deoxycoformycin, 100 \u03bcM of the test compound, and enzyme. Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C water bath. Aliquots of 50 \u03bcl were taken at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 4-h intervals, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of 1 M perchloric acid. Samples were neutralized to pH 7, and precipitated salts were removed by centrifugation. Reactants and products were separated by HPLC using Bio Basic anion exchange column (Thermo Electron Corp., Bellefonte, PA) with a 40-min linear salt and pH gradient from 5 mM ammonium phosphate (pH 2.8) to 750 mM ammonium phosphate (pH 6). Peaks were detected as they eluted from the column by absorbance at their \u03bb\nmax, typically 215 nm. All enzyme reactions were linear during the incubation period and substrate conversions were maintained at less than 10%.12 The potential for inhibition of hADK activity was evaluated by monitoring the formation of ribavirin monophosphate in the presence of compounds 2\u20138. The initial ribavirin concentration was 0.1 \u03bcM, with individual compounds at 400 \u03bcM.",

In addition, none of the ribavirin analogs (2\u20138) inhibited the phosphorylation of ribavirin by hADK (data not shown). Since a 4000-fold excess of compound did not inhibit the phosphorylation of ribavirin, these results indicated that the K\nm of the analogs was much higher than the K\nm for ribavirin.
