SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and several members from the beta coronavirus family, including bat and pangolin coronaviruses (3\u20135). Possibly due to stronger binding affinity of the virus spike protein for the host receptor (6\u201310), SARS-CoV-2 has much higher incidence of human to human transmission, resulting in infection worldwide.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a positive strand RNA virus. Its replication is mediated by a multi-subunit replication/transcription complex of viral non-structural proteins (nsp) (11). The core component of this complex is the catalytic subunit (nsp12) of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (12, 13). By itself, nsp12 has little activity and its functions require accessory factors including nsp7 and nsp8 (14, 15), which increase RdRp template binding and processivity. RdRp is also proposed to be the target of a class of antiviral drugs that are nucleotide analogs, including Remdesivir (16\u201318), which is a prodrug that is converted to the active drug in the triphosphate form (RTP) within cells (19). As such, RdRp has been a subject of intensive structural biology efforts. The structures of nsp7, nsp8, and the complex of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 have been determined (15, 20\u201323), providing the overall architecture of the RdRp complex. However, the drug discovery effort is hampered because there is no structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in complex with an RNA template or with nucleotide inhibitors. Here we determined two cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex either in the apo form or in a complex with a template-primer RNA and the antiviral drug Remdesivir.",

The stoichiometric ratio of nsp7 and nsp8 appeared to be less than nsp12, thus additional bacterially expressed nsp7 and nsp8 were supplemented before the final purification step to improve the yield of heterotrimeric complex. The purified nsp12 alone showed little activity in binding to a 50-base partial double-stranded template-primer RNA (Fig. 1B and fig. S1E), which is similar to the SARS-CoV nsp12 (14). The presence of nsp7 and nsp8 dramatically increased nsp12 binding to the template-primer RNA (fig. S1E). The nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex also showed RNA polymerization activity on a poly-U template upon addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Fig. 1, B and C). This RNA polymerization activity was effectively inhibited by the addition of the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir (RTP) (Fig. 1D). Even in the presence of 10 mM ATP, 1 mM RTP completely inhibited RdRp polymerization activity. In contrast, Remdesivir, as a prodrug, at 5 mM concentration, did not have any inhibitory effect on the polymerization activity of the purified enzyme (fig. S1F), neither did Remdesivir in its monophosphate form (RMP) (fig. S1G).",

Negative-stain EM visualization of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex displayed monodispersed particles with excellent homogeneity (fig. S1I). For the apo nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex, we vitrified the sample in the presence of the detergent DDM. The initial attempt at image processing revealed that the particles are preferentially oriented (fig. S2A). Therefore, we collected over 7,400 micrograph movies of more than 5.7 million particle projections to increase the number of projection from the non-preferential orientation. Of these, 81,494 particles were used to yield a density map of 2.8 \u00c5 resolution (fig. S2, B and E). Cryo-EM studies of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex bound with the template-primer RNA and RTP (termed as the template-RTP RdRp complex) faced two challenges (fig. S3). First, most particles were adsorbed to cryo-EM grid bars rather than staying in the vitreous ice. Second, the RNA duplex were dissociated from the template-RTP RdRp complex likely due to conditions of cryo-EM specimen preparation. Eventually, we prepared the cryo-EM specimen of the template-RTP RdRp complex at 15 mg/ml, much higher than normal concentrations used for EM studies of soluble protein complexes. The high concentration of the complex has a mass action effect to stabilize the RNA-protein complex and has excess amount of the complex to escape the absorption of cryo-EM grid bars to enter the vitreous ice (fig. S3). We collected 2,886 micrograph movies, which yielded a 2.5 \u00c5 resolution structure using 130,386 particle projections. Because of the relatively high resolution of our structure, the EM map is clear for key structural features across the complex (fig. S4, A to F).",

Different from the SARS-CoV RdRp structure but similar to the recent SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure, our structure reveals that nsp12 also contains an N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin (residues 31-50) and an extended nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl-transferase domain (NiRAN, residues 115-250) (24), with seven helices and three \u03b2-strands (15, 23). Following the NiRAN domain is an interface domain (residues 251-365) composed of three helices and five \u03b2-strands, which is connected to the RdRp domain (residues 366-920) (Figs. 1A and 2B). The nsp12 RdRp domain displays the canonical cupped right-handed configuration (25), with the finger subdomain (resides 397-581 and residues 621-679) forming a closed circle with the thumb subdomain (residues 819-920) (Fig. 2, A and B). The closed conformation is stabilized by the binding of nsp7 and nsp8, with one nsp8 molecule sitting on the top of the finger subdomain and interacting with the interface domain. The closed conformation of nsp12 is further stabilized by the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer, which is packed against the thumb-finger interface (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, we were able to assign two zinc ions in the conserved metal binding motifs composed by H295-C301-C306-C310 and C487-H642-C645-C646 (Fig. 2C), which are also observed in the SARS-CoV RdRp structure (15). These zinc ions likely serve as conserved structural components in maintaining the integrity of the RdRp architecture.",

Extensive protein-RNA interactions are observed between the template-primer RNA and nsp12, with a total of 29 residues from nsp12 directly participating in the binding of the RNA (Fig. 4E). Surprisingly no RNA interactions are mediated by nsp7 or nsp8 although these two proteins are required for RNA binding by RdRp. Most protein-RNA interactions involve the RNA phosphate-ribose backbones, with many interactions directly to 2\u2032-OH groups (Fig. 4E), thus providing a basis to distinguish RNA from DNA. There are no contacts from nsp12 to any base pairs of the template-primer RNA, suggesting a sequence independent binding of RNA by RdRp.

Motif F also interacts with the primer strand RNA with the side chains of K545 and R555 contacting the +1 base (Fig. 3D), thus stabilizing the incoming nucleotide in the correct position for catalysis.

            "text": "Structural comparison reveals several interesting differences between the apo and complex structures (Fig. 3, E and F, and fig. S8, A and B). First, nsp7 moves toward the RdRp core by 1.5 \u00c5 (as measured by nsp7 residue F49, fig. S8, A and B), leading to a rearrangement of the interface, which results in weaker association of the second nsp8 in the complex. Second, the loop that connects the first and second helix of the thumb subdomain moves outward by 2.8 \u00c5 (as measured by nsp12 residue I847) to accommodate the binding of the double stranded RNA helix (Fig. 3F). Third, motif G residues K500 and S501 also move outward by 2.0 \u00c5 to accommodate the binding of the template strand RNA. Outside of these changes, the apo nsp12 and the RNA-complex nsp12 are very similar, with an RMSD of 0.52 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 atoms across the whole protein. In particular, the structural elements that make up the catalytic active site can be exactly superimposed (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is a relatively stable enzyme that is ready to function as a replicase upon binding of RNA template. Viral RdRp is a highly processive enzyme with a rate of replication up to 100 nucleotides per second (34). No significant conformational changes between the apo and the active enzyme structures are consistent with the high processivity of the viral RNA polymerase, which does not need to consume additional energy for conformational changes in the active site during the replication cycle.",

Like Remdesivir, these nucleotide analogs are proposed to inhibit the viral RdRp through non-obligate RNA chain termination, a mechanism that requires the conversion of the parent compound to the triphosphate active form (33). The structure of the template-RTP RdRp complex provides an excellent model to rationalize how these drugs inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity (fig. S8C). In particular, EIDD-2801 has been shown to be 3-10 times more potent than Remdesivir in blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication (36). The N4 hydroxyl group off the cytidine ring forms an extra hydrogen bond with the side chain of K545 and cytidine base also forms an extra hydrogen bond with the guanine base from the template strand. These two extra hydrogen bonds may explain the apparent higher potency of EIDD-2801 in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

Enzymes that are vital for the viral life cycle are excellent antiviral drug targets as they are different from the host proteins. Among viral enzymes, RdRp is the major target of many existing nucleotide drugs. In this paper, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex in the apo form and in the complex with a template-primer RNA and the active form of Remdesivir. The structures reveal how the template-primer RNA is recognized by the enzyme and how chain elongation is inhibited by Remdesivir. Structure comparison and sequence alignment suggest that the mode of substrate RNA recognition and Remdesivir inhibition of RdRp is highly conserved in diverse RNA viruses, providing a basis for designing broad spectrum antiviral drugs based on nucleotide analogs. Moreover, our structures provide a solid template for modeling and modifying the existing nucleotide drugs, including the highly potent EIDD-2801. Together, these observations provide a rational basis to design even more potent inhibitors to combat the vicious infection of SARS-CoV-2.",
