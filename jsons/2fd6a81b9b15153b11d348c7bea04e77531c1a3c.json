This editorial outlines some of these challenges and research questions, and serves as a preliminary framework of what needs to be addressed. Mental healthcare should be an integral component of healthcare policy and practice towards COVID-19.

The pandemic affects everyone, but the impact on some groups may be greater, as is commonly the case where there are pre-existing health inequalities and social exclusion and stigma related to chronic conditions such as schizophrenia or depression or mental illnesses in general. Thus, those with preexisting conditions are at risk, yet these are often assumed to mean diabetes, heart or lung disease, cancer or immunocompromising disorders. Yet, people with mental illnesses already have higher rates of chronic medical conditions and a shortened lifespan. People with mental illness also struggle with poverty, housing, access to education and employment, and social connection, especially if their illnesses are very disabling affecting communication and relational skills. Consequently, a pandemic may well be expected to affect them even more than patients without psychiatric illnesses.",

Psychiatric patients should be considered an extremely vulnerable population in the COVID-19 pandemic. Incorporating psychiatric care and mental healthcare in general into the response to COVID-19 must thus be regarded a major public health imperative; any official response to a pandemic like COVID-19 without a psychiatric component would violate a government's prime duty: to ensure the health and safety of the society.",

Will the COVID-19 pandemic peaking in the spring further exacerbate seasonal (spring) mania and suicidality? (b) Will a pandemic like COVID-19 trigger psychiatric illnesses in people who so far have been considered mentally healthy? Or in other words, can it lead to an increase in psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity in the general population? (c) How can psychiatrists and other mental healthcare professionals meaningfully address the potential impact on mental health of the population? In particular, how can a discipline that is based on a very close doctor-patient relationship uphold its standards of authenticity and empathy when both doctors and patients are considered a potential source of infection? (d) In our new world of social isolation, patients in need of care, even urgent care, are cancelling necessary appointments. How do we make telepsychiatry as meaningful, efficient and as effective as possible? Further, will such isolation lead to future psychiatric symptoms? (e) How can the mental health ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic be communicated to other, non-psychiatrically trained health professionals? This also includes the impact on first responders (police, paramedics etc) and health professionals (emergency room and intensive care unit staff) working on the frontline of the fight against COVID-19. (f) How can we avoid and fight stigma and aggression and discrimination directed at people infected or presumed to be affected by COVID-19? (g) Are liaison psychiatrists, who frequently are requested to consult prior to neurologists, cognizant and prepared to address atypical neurological and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with COVID-19? Integrated care is recommended among healthcare providers. (h) As healthcare systems focus on the direct medical effects of COVID-19 with reallocation of resources including personnel, there may be a negative impact on both the quantity and quality of mental healthcare. This has long-term effects for psychiatric and general populations, for healthcare providers and first responders, as disasters, high-mortality infectious outbreaks and this pandemic in particular will lead to significant levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), especially if a period of quarantine is required. 1, 2 The current medical morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 must be dramatically addressed, but so too should the acute and chronic morbidity and even mortality from the development and/or worsening of PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses.",

[9] [10] [11] Findings from all SARS, MERS and even preliminary COVID-19 studies will assist in focusing responses to the challenges posed, although the dynamic implications of rapidly progressive COVID-19 statistics with global and prolonged lockdowns suggest that COVID-19 will have an even greater social and psychological impact than SARS and MERS. What is needed goes beyond research; 'hands-on' psychiatric and mental healthcare clinical interventions are needed. International societies can work together to formulate intervention position statements to be shared with clinicians, patients and caregivers to help alleviate the degree of anxiety and depression both acutely and to address long-term sequelae.",

We have been witnessing increased antagonism towards specific groups with high infection rates that in turn has led to patients presenting with both enacted and felt stigma and associated increased anxiety and depression. Combining the stigma associated with mental illness with the stigma now shown towards certain COVID-positive patients may lead to double stigma, a barrier to psychiatric treatment adherence with resultant increased morbidity. Reducing stigma requires both national and international interventions.",

We must work together to maximise knowledge, always remembering that only with knowledge come the many solutions required for today and the future.",
