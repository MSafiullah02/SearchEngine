This success is typified by the rapid decline in the prevalence of key canine infectious diseases (caused by canine distemper virus [CDV] , canine adenovirus [CAV] and canine parvovirus [CPV] ) following the introduction of efficacious modified live virus vaccines. Similar effects relate to the introduction of feline vaccines, with clear reduction in mortality caused by feline parvovirus (FPV; feline panleukopenia) and morbidity caused by feline calicivirus (FCV) and herpesvirus (FHV) infections. However, the success of these vaccines cannot be a cause for complacency, and indeed vaccine-related issues have featured high on the agenda of the veterinary profession over the past decade. There are many challenges remaining in small animal vaccinology, and in 2006 the WSAVA Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) was convened with the specific remit of taking a global perspective on issues surrounding the practice of vaccination of dogs and cats. The VGG has met formally on three occasions and corresponded electronically between these meetings, and this document is the result of these deliberations. The VGG guidelines are built on those developed by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccine Task Force and the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) Feline Vaccine Advisory Panel. Based upon a consensus among experts, these recommendations reflect a combination of opinion, experience, and scientific data, published and unpublished. The present vaccination guidelines are intended for the general veterinary practice and the shelter environment; they do not represent a standard of care or set of legal parameters. They have been drafted with the objective of educating and informing the profession and to recommend rational vaccine use for individual pets and dog/cat populations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 309, "text": "[CDV]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 330, "end": 335, "text": "[CAV]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 358, "end": 363, "text": "[CPV]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 656, "end": 661, "text": "(FHV)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "If vaccination has been so successful, then why is it necessary to continually re-evaluate vaccination practice? There is little doubt that in most developed countries the major infectious diseases of dogs and cats are considered at best uncommon in the pet population, but there do remain geographical pockets of infection and sporadic outbreaks of disease occur, and the situation regarding feral or shelter populations is distinctly different to that in owned pet animals. However, in many developing countries these key infectious diseases remain as common as they once were in developed nations and a major cause of mortality in small animals. Although it is difficult to obtain accurate figures, even in developed countries it is estimated that only 30 -50% of the pet animal population is vaccinated, and this is significantly less in developing nations. In small animal medicine, we have been slow to grasp the concept of 'herd immunity'that vaccination of individual pet animals is important, not only to protect the individual, but to reduce the number of susceptible animals in the regional population, and thus the prevalence of disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CURRENT ISSUES IN SMALL ANIMAL VACCINOLOGY"}, {"text": "A second major concept regarding vaccination of dogs and cats has been the recognition that we should aim to reduce the 'vaccine load' on individual animals in order to minimise the potential for adverse reactions to vaccine products. For that reason we have seen the development of vaccination guidelines based on a rational analysis of the vaccine requirements for each pet, and the proposal that vaccines be considered 'core' and 'non-core' in nature. To an extent this categorisation of products has been based on available scientific evidence and personal experience -but concerted effort to introduce effective companion animal disease surveillance on a global scale would provide a more definitive basis on which to recommend vaccine usage. In parallel with the categorisation of vaccines has been the push towards marketing products with extended duration of immunity (DOI), to reduce the unnecessary administration of vaccines and thereby further improve vaccine safety. Both of these changes have necessitated a frame-shift in the mindset of veterinary practitioners in a culture in which both veterinarian and client have become subservient to the mantra of annual vaccination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CURRENT ISSUES IN SMALL ANIMAL VACCINOLOGY"}, {"text": "The following VGG guidelines are prepared when considering the optimum model of a committed pet owner, willing and able to bring their animal to the veterinarian, for the full recommended course of vaccination. The VGG is aware that there are less committed pet owners and countries where severe financial constraints will determine the nature of the vaccine course that will be administered. In situations where, for example, a decision must be made that an individual pet may have to receive only a single core vaccination during its lifetime, the VGG would emphasise that this should optimally be given at a time when that animal is most capable of responding immunologically, i.e. at the age of 16 weeks or greater.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CURRENT ISSUES IN SMALL ANIMAL VACCINOLOGY"}, {"text": "The VGG has additionally considered vaccination in the shelter situation. The guidelines that we have proposed are those that we consider provides the optimum level of protection for these highly susceptible animals.

The VGG recognises that particular countries will identify additional vaccines that they consider core. A particular example of a vaccine that may be considered core in only some countries is that against rabies virus. In a geographical area in which this infection is endemic all dogs should be routinely vaccinated for the protection of both the pet and human populations. In some countries, mandatory rabies vaccination is a legal requirement, and is generally also required for international pet travel. Non-core vaccines are those that are licensed for the dog and whose use is determined on the basis of the animal's geographical and lifestyle exposure and an assessment of risk-benefit ratios.

Pups with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until $12 weeks of age. No single primary vaccination policy will therefore cover all possible situations. The recommendation of the VGG is for initial vaccination at 8 to 9 weeks of age followed by a second vaccination 3 to 4 weeks later, and a third vaccination given between 14 to 16 weeks of age. By contrast, at present many vaccine data sheets recommend an initial course of two injections. Some products are also licensed with a '10 week finish' designed such that the second of two vaccinations is given at 10 weeks of age. The rationale behind this protocol is to permit 'early socialisation' of pups. The VGG recognises that this is of great benefit to the behavioural development of dogs.

A positive test result on the other hand would lead to the conclusion that revaccination is not required. This is why robust yes/no answers must be provided by any assay.

It is believed (but unproven) that the high susceptibility to CPV-2 recognised in certain Rottweilers and Dobermans during the 1980s (regardless of their vaccination history) was due to a high prevalence of non-responders. In the USA today, these two breeds seem to have no greater numbers of non-responders than other breeds, possibly because carriers of the genetic trait may have died from CPV-2.

Therefore, when antibody is absent (irrespective of the serological test used) the dog should be revaccinated unless there is a medical basis for not so doing. Antibody determinations to other vaccine components are of limited value because of the short time period these antibodies persist (e.g., Leptospira products) or the lack of correlation between serum antibody and protection (e.g. canine parainfluenza).
