ECLS, which is the name better describes this technology, is a modified form of cardiopulmonary bypass that is used to support patients with cardiopulmonary failure unresponsive to conventional treatment. ECLS is performed to drain blood from the venous system, remove carbon dioxide (CO2), add oxygen (O2) through an artificial lung (the oxygenator), and return the blood using a pump to the body via an artery as in VA ECMO or a vein as in VV ECMO [1\u2022\u2022, 2\u20136]. It is important to recognize that ECLS is a support modality but not a cure. It provides time for other diagnostic and therapeutic measures to be pursued allowing injured organs to recover meanwhile abundance of oxygenation and optimum tissue perfusion is guaranteed. ECLS is a complex, invasive, high-risk, and costly technology, and it should only be conducted in centers with sufficient experience, knowledge, and expertise in that field.",

            "text": "ECLS finds its roots in the first blood oxygenator, designed by Dr. Gibbon in the 1950\u2019s. It was first created to sustain patients during heart surgery and relied on direct blood-air contact for oxygenation [7]. The utilization of this machine was limited to only few hours because of the hemolysis and bleeding resulting from direct blood-gas contact. The early work done by Clowes on developing an artificial lung using ethyl cellulose membrane and soon after by Kammermeyer to optimize the use of silicone rubber membrane in the 1950\u2019s [8, 9] provided a strong framework until Kolobow perfected the development of the silicone membrane oxygenator in the 1960\u2019s [10]. This invention allowed the prolonged use of the heart lung bypass machine by clinicians outside the operating room. Several groups were working on this concept in the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s. Dr. Bartlett and bioengineer Drinker successfully applied ECLS in the laboratory for 4 days using the newly developed membrane oxygenator with lower heparin dosage to minimize bleeding. Dr. Bartlett, who is considered by many as the father of ECMO, moved to the University of California at Irvine in 1970, where he continued to do his work in the laboratory to optimize cardiopulmonary bypass for prolonged use. In 1972, Dr. Hill reported the first successful use of ECLS in a young adult who suffered from severe hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to motorcycle accident in Santa Barbara, California [11]. Same year, Dr. Bartlett performed the first successful use of VA ECMO on a baby who suffered from low cardiac output syndrome immediately after Mustard atrial baffle operation for transposition of great vessels. The first neonatal respiratory survival was not reported until 1975 when Drs Bartlett and Gazzaniga successfully used VA ECMO for a full-term newborn who was suffering from severe hypoxic lung disease thought to be secondary to meconium aspiration (MA) [2]. In 1982, Dr. Bartlett and colleagues published their experience in the use of ECMO for newborn respiratory failure [3]. He described the use of ECMO in 45 moribund newborn infants; 25 patients survived. All were deemed unresponsive to conventional therapy. The right atrium (RA) and the aortic arch (AA) were cannulated via the internal jugular vein (IJV) and the carotid artery (CA), respectively. Primary diagnoses were hyaline membrane disease, sepsis, and persistent fetal circulation including congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and MA. This paper concluded that ECMO use has decreased mortality and morbidity in newborn respiratory failure, and that ECMO may be used effectively in older patients with respiratory failure if used before irreversible lung damage occurs.",

            "text": "VA and VV ECLS are the most commonly used modes of support [1\u2022\u2022, 5, 6, 12, Redbook-13]. VA ECLS provides cardiac and pulmonary support. Therefore, this can be used in ARDS patients suffering from cardiac or circulatory failure as in severe septic shock. It is the ideal mode of support in cases of severe cardiogenic shock (e.g., cardiomyopathy, myocarditis). Support can be partial or total depending on site of cannulation, size and position of the cannulae used, and the native cardiac function. Oxygen delivery (DO2) is the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues each minute. It equals the oxygen content times the cardiac output. The more blood diverted to the ECLS circuit (maximum cardiac output) with the presence of normal hemoglobin (maximizing oxygen content); DO2 is maximized. VA ECLS cannulation can be done using one of three access points: first by using the transcervical approach, placing the venous cannula in the RA via the right IJV and the arterial cannula in the AA via the right CA. It is important to assure that the tip of the arterial cannula is away from the aortic valve as this can damage the valve and hinders the myocardial recovery. This approach may provide 50\u201380% extracorporeal support as part of the blood volume still passes through the patient\u2019s native heart and lung. The second approach is the central or transthoracic approach with direct venous cannula placement in the right atrial appendage and arterial cannula placement in the AA. This approach is typically used in post-operative cardiac patients once they fail coming off CPB. This may provide total ECLS support as the ECLS circuit captures all blood volume and none passes through the native heart. It also has been described in patients with severe septic shock [12]. The third approach is cannulating the femoral artery and the femoral vein. This approach has been described in adults and older children and has been used in cases of emergency cannulation or extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). VA ECLS provide circulatory support. In most cases, inotropes and vasopressors are weaned off soon after ECLS initiation. Coronary perfusion is provided by retrograde flow via the arterial cannula, which emphasizes the importance to have its tip accurately placed in the aortic arch away from the aortic valve.",

            "text": "VV ECLS is ideal for pulmonary support in cases of severe respiratory failure. It does not provide cardiac nor circulatory support. Blood is typically drained from the venae cavae and retained to the right atrium. That can be done either by multisite cannulation; usually by draining from a venous cannula in the inferior vena cava via the femoral vein and returning to the RA via the IJV; or single-site cannulation with the use of a double lumen catheter, draining the blood from the venae cavae and returning it to the RA. Currently, most of venovenous access is achieved by cannulating the right IJV using a double lumen catheter, which minimizes the problem of recirculation that dominates the multisite access approach. Other than sparing the carotid artery and minimizing the risk of systemic embolization especially embolic strokes [13], the benefits of VV ECLS for pediatric respiratory ECLS are evident. The pulmonary blood flow is maintained in VV ECLS with well-oxygenated blood, which is considered a great vasodilator of the pulmonary circulation that leads to reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). As a result, the afterload of the RV will decrease, augmenting its systolic and diastolic function. These effects continue through to the left side of the heart as the LV preload is optimized and coronary perfusion is maintained with highly oxygenated blood. There is no increase in LV afterload, and the risk of \u201cmyocardial stun\u201d in minimized, with resulting improvement in myocardial oxygen delivery and myocardial performance [14, 15].",

The blood is squeezed forward through the tubing \u201cthe raceway\u201d against a plate at two pressure points in the pump housing while the roller head is rotating. This provides continuous forward motion of the blood towards the oxygenator and then back to the body. These pumps depend on gravity for the venous drainage into the pump (preload), so the patient has to be at a certain height (100\u2013150 cmH2O) from the pump and the bladder reservoir for it to work. Whenever there is an interruption to that flow either secondary to hypovolemia, pleural or pericardial tamponade pathology, or kinking in the tubing; the pump will just slow down or stop till the venous return is reestablished or the cause of the problem is corrected. Newer pumps have servo-regulation capabilities that allow the ECLS specialists to set the alarms so the pump will slow down once certain negative venous (access) pressures are reached. This allows the specialist to troubleshoot and address the problem preventing many interruptions and stoppage of pump flow [14, 19\u2022, Fuhrman, 20].",

The Kolobow silicone membrane oxygenator was, for decades, the only available gas exchange device in the market. It was constructed of a flat, reinforced silicone membrane envelope that is wound in a spiral coil around a polycarbonate spool. There was a highly gas-permeable barrier separating blood and gas compartments, with no direct blood-gas interface. Gas transfer occurs by molecular diffusion as it does in the human lung. The silicone membrane oxygenator was effective in gas exchange, but its compact design created long blood path and high resistance that made it harder to de-air and more challenging to prime. A separate blood warmers (heat exchanger) was needed for most of these devices. It was not unusual to replace these devices during ECLS or to need more than one oxygenator to support older pediatric and adult patients. The silicone membrane oxygenators are not available in the market anymore. These hurtles lead to the development of newer generation of devices, the hollow fiber oxygenators. These devices consist of micro porous material where gas exchange takes place by bulk gas transfer via a direct gas to blood interface. These devices are easy to prime, have low resistance, and provide efficient gas exchange. But the longevity of these devices is limited, plasma leak into the gas phase would occur as early as few hours from ECLS initiation, that lead to early failure of these devices and the need to be replaced urgently.",

The PMP is a micro porous material that is very efficient in gas exchange for extended period of time. These devices are durable and may attenuate the inflammatory response during ECLS initiation. They have low resistance to blood flow, which makes them easy to prime, reducing the potential for thrombus formations and oxygenator failure. The rated flow is a measure that is used to describe the function of all gas exchange devices. The rated flow, which is the amount of normal venous blood that can be raised from 75 to 95% oxyhemoglobin saturation in a given period of time, is high which allows many centers to use one-size device for all patients regardless of their size and weight [14, 19\u2022].",

The most common diagnoses are meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), CDH, sepsis [23], persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and respiratory distress syndrome. MAS used to be the most common diagnosis till recently. In the early 1990\u2019s, other treatment options such as high frequency ventilation (HFV), surfactant, and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) became more available [24\u201326]. It is believed that the increasing use of these therapies has led to the significant reduction of ECLS use in this patient population [4, 24, 25, 27] especially in neonates with MAS. There were around 800 neonatal ECLS runs reported every year for the last 15 years compared to almost 1500 annual cases in the early 1990s. The use of neonatal ECLS peaked in 1992 with a total of 1516 neonates that year from approximately 100 centers around the globe. VA ECLS is still the most common mode used in neonates, followed by VV ECLS using the double lumen cannula [28]. Therapeutic hypothermia during neonatal ECLS did not result in improved outcome up to 2 years of age [29].",

            "text": "CDH occurs in about 1:2500 live births. The presence of pulmonary hypoplasia may result in pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) with hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis that could be evident soon after birth. Variety of ventilation strategies and other treatment modalities (e.g., iNO) may be needed in the first few days of life [35\u2022\u2022, 36]. ECLS have been used for more than three decades in CDH patients with PHTN unresponsive to maximum conventional therapy. VA and VV ECLS have been used effectively; however, VA ECLS is more commonly used as it unloads the RV that may aid in restoring myocardial function. Looking at ELSO data, CDH mortality did not change significantly over the last two decades. Overall, the reported survival rates for CDH and ECLS is about 50\u201365% [37]. As in other neonatal ECLS, the oxygenation index (OI) has been used to determine need for ECLS support. OI more than 40 for more than 4 h is considered an indication for ECLS. Pre-ECLS factors (e.g., Apgar score, PaO2, PCO2, pH) failed to predict outcome or prognosis [35\u2022\u2022] and clinicians should reevaluate selection criteria for not offering ECLS to this selected group of patients. The timing of defect repair of ECLS-managed patients is controversial. There are two main groups, on or off ECLS. Surgery performed during ECLS can be either early in the ECLS course or when PHTN is resolved just before decannulation. A review of over 600 cases from the CDH study group (CDHSG) registry [37] over a 10-year period evaluated the outcome of surgery either during or after ECLS. Taking into account other outcome-associated variables such as duration of ECLS run, type of surgical repair, and patient factors, patients repaired post ECLS had a significantly better outcome. The odds of dying were 1.4 times greater if the repair was performed during ECLS. This may be associated with a reduced bleeding risk as well as bias towards patients who have improved more quickly allowing ECLS decannulation. The ability to wean off ECLS within a two-week period may contribute positively to the outcome with respect to the timing of surgery [38]. If the patient was weaned off ECMO within 2 weeks, surgical correction post ECMO was associated with a significantly better outcome and a significantly reduced risk of bleeding when compared to patients at that institution who were repaired on ECLS. The early repair on ECLS has been suggested to offer the benefit of surgery before the anasarca becomes extensive and allows recovery from the physiologic insult while on ECLS, hopefully without prolonging the ECLS duration. A review of repair within 3 days of ECLS [39] demonstrated that the risk of bleeding at surgical site was <10%, the operative repair took less than 2 h with a survival rate of 70%. Other ECLS-related bleeding complications were no different from those reported to the ELSO registry. Anticoagulation management during ECLS for CDH is pivotal especially if CDH repair is performed during ECLS run. A review of ATIII use in (target activity >65%) CDH ECLS patients [40] when compared to the institutions historical control demonstrated that the use of ATIII lead to significant reduction in the utilization of FFP, packed red cells, and platelets in the first 3 days of ECLS. The use of large volumes on blood products may adversely affect lung mechanics and delay recovery. Amicar and tranexamic acid used peri-operatively could be helpful to minimize bleeding.",

Patients are more complex with more comorbidities. Paden et al. [26] reported an increase in pediatric ECLS comorbidities from 19% in 1993 to 47% in 2007. Recent reports showed that pediatric ECLS patients with malignancies and immunodeficiency could have a reasonable outcome with a survival rate 35\u201348% [26, 49, 58]. Patients with bone marrow (BMT) and stem cell transplant present a particular challenge. Gow et al. [62] showed ECLS survival rate of 21% based on the ELSO registry data in 2006. Of those four patients who survived ECLS in that study, only one patient was able to leave the hospital. The development of renal failure and multiorgan dysfunction were considered risk factors for death. There are few case reports that described successful use of ECLS in BMT and stem cell transplant patients secondary to different etiologies [63]. The decision to offer ECLS in this patient population should be on a case-by-case basis. Providers should take into consideration the overall patient prognosis from the underlying illness, assess the presence of multiorgan dysfunction and understand the family wishes for their loved ones before considering ECLS as an option.",

Multisite venovenous cannulation was the preferred method used in pediatric respiratory ECLS. The continued advancement of VVDL, especially in the late 2000\u2019s when the bicaval wire-reinforced catheters was approved by the food and drug administration, single-site cannulation using these cannulas became a common practice [65\u2022\u2022, 67]. In 2011, VVDL cannulation for VV ECLS represented 71% of the total cannulation. The use of VVDL cannulas have provided improved VV ECLS pump performance with evidence suggesting reduction of the risk of recirculation traditionally related to the multisite approach. These cannulas can be inserted percutaneously, but need to be performed under imaging guidance to avoid the risk of atrial perforation or disruption to the hepatic vein [68, 69].

Many conventional methods were studied to minimize this risk with mixed results [70]. ECLS use in adults with ARDS was first described in 1972 with Dr. Hill\u2019s experience. This was followed by the first multicenter randomized trial of the use of ECLS in adults with ARDS conducted by Zapol et al. [71] at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in 1979. The results were disappointing as the mortality rate was >90%. This put the brakes on using ECLS for adult population for two decades. In 2004, Dr. Bartlett and colleagues [72] described their experience at the University of Michigan in the largest retrospective study discussing the use of ECLS in 255 adult patients with ARDS between 1989 and 2004 with a survival rate of 52%. A protocol-driven algorithm was used in their institution since 1989 guiding the treatment of severe ARDS including the use of ECLS. While on ECLS, lung rest strategies, minimal anticoagulation, and optimization of oxygen delivery were the key factors. These results were encouraging, and ECLS was perceived again as a viable and successful option for adults with ARDS not responsive to maximum conventional therapy. This regained confidence in adult respiratory ECLS was boosted by the encouraging results of the CESAR trial (efficacy and economics assessment of conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure) by Peek and colleagues in the UK [73]. This study showed improved survival rate without disability at 6 months after discharge from the hospital (63 vs 47%; RR=0.69; CI 0.05\u20130.97, P = 0.03) in adult patients with ARDS transferred to ECLS center. Sixty-eight patients were supported by ECLS of whom 43 (63%) survived.",

ECLS flow of 4\u20137 L/min would be ideal to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation for an adult with severe ARDS. Additional venous drainage cannula (usually in the femoral vein) may be warranted to achieve this goal. Arterial oxygen saturation more than 80% would be acceptable given that clinical and laboratory evidence of adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues is achieved. ECCO2R is a modality of extracorporeal support that is increasingly utilized in adult respiratory population when hypercapnia is the main drive behind the need for excessive minute ventilation and ECLS support. ECCO2R allows the use of low blood flow (0.8\u20132 L/min) via a pumpless device to remove CO2 efficiently. This typically is achieved by AV support accessing the femoral artery on one side and the femoral vein on the other side. This approach is ideal for patients with COPD exacerbation and hypercapnia.",

Vaginal bleeding was reported in 9% of all patients included in the study. Sharma et al. [96\u2022] performed a literature search from 2009 to 2014 looking at the use of ECLS in pregnancy and postpartum. Thirty-one reports were found, 16 reports of VA ECLS and 15 of VV ECLS with a total of 67 patients. Overall maternal survival rate was 80% while fetal survival was slightly lower than 70%. Most common indications were severe ARDS, postpartum cardiogenic shock, and amniotic fluid embolism. In one case, delivery by cesarean section was performed during ECLS; otherwise, delivery of the fetus was deferred. Anticoagulation management was conservative maintaining lower therapeutic levels of activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The author recommends using ACT levels 160\u2013180 s and aPTT 50\u201380 s. There were few cases with mild to moderate amounts of postpartum vaginal bleeding with one case of catastrophic hemorrhage. The most common bleeding sites were around tracheostomy and ECLS cannulation sites. The use of ECLS in pregnancy is controversial. There are no guidelines for its use in this patient population yet, however recent reports over the last 8 years showed that ECLS has been successfully used in pregnancy and postpartum patients for cardiopulmonary failure with good maternal and fetal outcomes. ECLS seems to be underutilized in this patient population. Careful patient selection and cautious anticoagulation management can reasonably minimize bleeding risk.",

Fifty-two patients were included in that review with moderate to severe head injury in 30 (58%) cases. All patients had multiple traumas and most of them (77%) had rib fractures with hemothorax and pneumothorax. Thirty-one percent of these patients underwent surgical procedure while on ECLS. VV ECLS and ECCO2R were the main modes of support. Their overall survival rate was 79%. Out of the 14 patients with intracranial bleeding, 11 ended up with an external ventricular drain and three underwent craniotomies. Multiorgan failure was the major cause of mortality; only one patient suffered from catastrophic bleeding and one with severe brain damage who eventually died. Other reports [98, 99] including more recent study by Guirand et al. [100] supported the use of ECLS mostly by VV support in trauma ARDS patients with favorable outcomes.",

Most of these patients (>95%) is supported by VA ECLS either via cervical or central cannulation, the later being more common in the immediate post-operative period in neonates. Pediatric patients with myocarditis have the best chances to survive (up to 72%). Cardiac ECLS is provided as a mean to organ recovery or as a bridge to transplant. Newer devices like ventricular assist devices (VAD) are more durable. Its use for cardiac support is growing over the last 15 years.

Conventional ventilation using synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) pressure control (PC) with pressure support (PS) is one way. Minute ventilation will be brought down to a minimum. PC of 5 cmH2O above positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) with a rate of 5, PEEP of 5\u201315 cmH2O and PS of 5\u201310 is acceptable as long as the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) stays below 20 and never exceeds 25 cmH2O.

It is cheap, available, has a short half-life, and can be reversed with protamine sulfate if needed. On the other hand, UFH is an indirect anticoagulant; it works by potentiating antithrombin (AT) effect to inhibit \u201cfree\u201d thrombin; it does not inhibit clot-bound or circuit-bound thrombin. Monitoring and managing anticoagulation therapy during ECLS is challenging especially in neonates and young children. Laboratory monitoring is typically done in vitro which does not account for the in vivo endothelial effect. Managing coagulation starts before ECLS, once a patient is considered a candidate for ECLS, basic coagulation laboratory values including platelets, aPTT, prothrombin time (PT), AT level, and fibrinogen are obtained.

            "text": "Optimal sedation and analgesia during ECLS remains poorly defined. Many studies have demonstrated the need to escalate sedation requirement during ECLS [115\u2013119]. Fentanyl and morphine [120] are the most commonly used opioids in ECLS. Escalation of these medications have been documented and attributed to an increase in the volume of distribution, increased sequestration in the circuit tubing and oxygenator, and decreased metabolism, at least in the case of morphine use [121], to its active metabolites. The use of benzodiazepine (e.g., midazolam and lorazepam) and dexmedetomidine [122, 123] are common practices in different age groups. Dexmedetomidine is an \u03b1-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that has analgosedative effects that may facilitate weaning heavy sedation. It is not uncommon for ECLS patients to be heavily sedated during the first few days. The use of muscle relaxation is commonly used in cannulation, decannulation, and during procedures. It should not be a routine practice. Non-depolarizing agents are commonly used in PICU settings including ECLS patients when necessary. These agents can be used as continuous infusion (e.g., Cisatracurium, Atracurium, vecuronium) or bolus dosing (Rocuronium, vecuronium). Cisatracurium is considered an appropriate agent to use in ECLS patients because of its reasonable recovery time once turned off (20\u201330 min), safety profile, and ability to use in patients with multiorgan failure. Cisatracurium is eliminated by ester hydrolysis and Hofmann elimination. It is recommended to perform regular neurological examination on heavily sedated patients early in their course once or twice a day by lifting off the muscle relaxation and possibly reducing the sedation infusion.",

The development of new devices over the last few years resulted in a much simpler, safer, and prolonged ECLS support. New styles of patient management including minimal sedation, spontaneous breathing, early tracheostomy, and early mobilization are becoming more common. The next generation of ECLS devices will be easier to manage by caregivers, less thrombogenic, and more durable with less or no need for systemic anticoagulation. As per Dr. Bartlett, these are the highlights of the next era in ECLS care \u201cECMO III.\u201d",
