Cholesterol depletion leads to disorganization of lipid raft microdomains and dissociation of bound proteins [1], [2]. Lipid rafts play important roles in many cellular processes such as signal transduction, kinase activity modulation, cell migration and axonal guidance [3], [4], [5], [6]. They are also involved in multiple stages of the virus life cycle, including viral entry and fusion, viral protein transport and targeting, and viral assembly and budding [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].",

PRRSV has restricted cell tropism for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage [13]. Among non-macrophage cells, only the MA-104 cell line derived from African green monkey kidney and its replication derivative, MARC-145, were susceptible to PRRSV [14]. Therefore MARC-145 cell is the most used cell in PRRSV studies. The virus enters the target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the sialoadhesin and scavenger receptor CD163 are known as PRRSV entry mediators. However, MARC-145 cells do not express sialoadhesin [15].",

We found that intact cell membrane cholesterol was indispensable for PRRSV entry into MARC-145 cells. Further results showed that cholesterol depletion did not change the expression level of CD163 on the surface of MARC-145 cells. Our data also showed that the uptake of transferrin, a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was not affected by cholesterol depletion, while cholera toxin subunit B, a marker for the presence of lipid rafts, was no longer efficiently internalized in the presence of M\u03b2CD. These results suggested that lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis is required for PRRSV infection.",

The cell toxicity of M\u03b2CD on MARC-145 cells was measured by using MTT assays. The results showed that there was no significant difference in cell viability between the untreated cells and the cells treated with M\u03b2CD at concentrations of up to 3 mM for 24 h (Fig. 1C). The cholesterol level in M\u03b2CD-treated MARC-145 cells was determined using the Amplex Red cholesterol quantification assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, the cholesterol level in the cells decreased about 26%, 44% and 76% after treated with 1, 2 and 3 mM M\u03b2CD for 24 h, respectively, when compared to mock-treated cells.",
