The relative ease of transmission of the virus, the death, illness, and suffering it has caused, its ability to overwhelm health care systems, and its disruption of social life and economic structures make the disease a source of panic, anxiety, and fear. Tapping into overwhelming public interest in the development of effective vaccines and therapies for COVID-19, some businesses are promoting stem cells-based interventions or exosome products that supposedly treat or prevent COVID-19 or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) experienced by some victims of the virus (Knoepfler, 2020) . The purported stem cell treatments these companies sell are unproven, have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other national regulatory bodies, pose risks to patients, and have the potential to undercut efforts to develop evidence-based stem cell treatments and other therapeutic products.",

An additional concern with such poorly designed or very preliminary studies is that despite not having the capacity to generate robust evidence they could lead to patients with COVID-19 seeking access to unproven stem cell products on a Right-to-Try basis. In contrast, other studies are well-designed, multi-center randomized controlled trials that should generate valuable data concerning whether particular stem cell-based products can be used to treat individuals with COVID-19. Funding agencies are also providing support for stem cell research related to COVID-19. For example, the California Institute for Regenerative",

            "text": "). News media accounts of stem cell \"cures\" for COVID-19 reveal that individual case reports and preliminary clinical studies with few research subjects are being depicted in a misleading and Numerous clinical studies testing various stem cell and exosome products for COVID-19 are underway in China, the U.S., and elsewhere(Khoury, M. Cuenca, J., Cruz, F., Figueroa, F., Rocco, P., Weiss, D. 2020). More such studies will doubtless be registered in clinical trials databases as researchers around the world attempt to develop safe and efficacious treatments for COVID-19. However, at present there are no publicly available results for most of these trials. Instead, stem cell hyperbole related to COVID-19 appears to be driven by a pre-print reporting a single case in which stem cells were administered to a person Rocco, P., Weiss, D. 2020). Acknowledging the many challenges the pandemic poses to the clinical research enterprise, and recognizing the urgency of finding treatments, such products need to be tested in well-designed and rigorously conducted clinical trials capable of generating meaningful safety and efficacy data(Kalil, A. 2020). Only by conducting such trials will it be possible to determine whether there is substantial evidence that supports approving one or more stem cell products as treatments for COVID-19. In contrast, the preliminary clinical studies that have already involved administering stem cell products to individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 do not support commercializing such interventions or justify claiming they are effective treatments for COVID-19. Data from clinical studies testing administration of mesenchymal stromal cells in individuals suffering from various kinds of lung diseases also highlight the importance of avoiding making premature claims about efficacy in the care of individuals with COVID-19. Despite the numerous clinical trials that have involved evaluating different kinds of stem cell interventions in individuals suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other respiratory diseases, no such stem cells-based products have been approved by the FDA or become evidence-based standard of care. Further research is needed to better understand how lungs regenerate and to determine whether particular cell-based products can be used as safe and efficacious therapies in treating particular respiratory diseases.",

The U.S.Department of Justice has also announced its intention to prosecute parties making fraudulent claims related to COVID-19 (https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus). Agencies responsible for overseeing markets for health products in other countries have likewise stated they intend to target individuals and companies making false claims and selling unapproved treatments and tests.To date the FDA has issued three untitled letters to businesses advertising unproven stem cell interventions or exome products for treatment or prevention of COVID-19. One such letter was sent to Dynamic Stem Cell Therapy, a company selling unlicensed stem cell products to prevent or treat COVID-19 (https://www.fda.gov/media/136668/download).A second letter was issued to Regenerative Solutions of New Jersey for advertising an unapproved exosome product for treatment or prevention of COVID-19 (https://www.fda.gov/media/137396/download). A third letter was issued to Kimera Labs, the business that supplied Regenerative Solutions of New Jersey with its exosome product (https://www.fda.gov/media/137129/download) Whether such untitled letters will have a wider impact on the market for unlicensed stem cell products remains to be determined. The FDA has not issued formal warning letters to any businesses selling unproven and unlicensed stem cell products or exosomes for COVID-19 or filed in federal court for permanent injunctions enjoining such businesses from marketing and administering unlicensed products for treatment or prevent of COVID-19.The FTC has also taken action against businesses unlawfully advertising stem cell \"treatments\" and other purported therapies for COVID-19, issuing warning letters to Absolute Health Clinic, American Medical Aesthetics, the Center for Regenerative Cell Medicine, Stemedix, and Vidaful Medicine (https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warningletters/covid-19-letter_to_absolute-health-clinic.pdf, https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_american-medicalaesthetics.pdf, https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_center-regenerative-cell-medicine.pdf, https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_stemedix-inc.pdf, https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap-vidafulmedicine.pdf).",
