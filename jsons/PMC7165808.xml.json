            "text": "As the majority of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, many efforts have been made to identify the animal species that may act as potential reservoir of zoonotic viruses (Olival et al., 2017). Bats (Chiroptera) are regarded as potential reservoirs or source of zoonotic infections, as they sum up a number of traits, including (a) an outstanding variety of species (Tsang, Cirranello, Bates, & Simmons, 2016); (b) gregarious habits (with colonies that often comprise hundreds or thousands of individuals); (c) resistance to viral infections, as they often harbour viruses without clinical signs (Zhang et al., 2013); and iv) high mobility, in some cases represented by long\u2010distance migratory movements (e.g. Flaquer et al., 2009).",

            "text": "To date, over 60 distinct viruses have been detected in bats, suggesting that these mammals can act as frequent viral hosts (Brook & Dobson, 2015; Fischer et al., 2016; Lelli et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2017; Smith & Wang, 2013). Identified viruses belong to the following families: Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae, Retroviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Totiviridae (Chen, Liu, Yang, & Jin, 2014). Virological investigations worldwide have identified in bats zoonotic pathogens like Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), beta coronaviruses, including SARS\u2010like CoV and MERS\u2010like CoV, astroviruses, orthoreoviruses (Calisher, Childs, Field, Holmes, & Schountz, 2006; Fischer, Pinho Dos Reis, & Balkema\u2010Buschmann, 2017; Lelli, Moreno, et al., 2013; Lelli, Papetti, et al., 2013), Melaka virus (Chua et al., 2011). Spillover events from bats to human can happen directly or indirectly via intermediate hosts (domestic or wildlife animals). It should be stressed, however, that direct bat\u2010to\u2010human transmission of viruses causing highly pathogenic disease has been demonstrated only for rabies viruses and related lyssaviruses, and for Nipah and Melaka viruses, whilst for other viruses (e.g. SARS\u2010CoV), transmission has been only supposed (Calisher et al., 2006; Chua et al., 2011; Guan et al., 2003). Evaluating this potential risk is crucial in Western countries. Several bat species avoid human settlements and have little chance to enter into contact with humans (Russo & Ancillotto, 2015), and other species are at risk of extinction (e.g. Conenna, Rocha, Russo, & Cabeza, 2016; O'Shea, Cryan, Hayman, Plowright, & Streicker, 2016), making the risks negligible. However, increasing anthropization of the environment is altering the ecosystems, disrupting usual habitats and/or creating novel ecological niches that may overlap with human activities. It should be considered, however, that bats provide important ecosystem services (Aizpurua et al., 2018; Ancillotto et al., 2017; Boyles, Cryan, McCracken, & Kunz, 2011; Kunz, Braun de Torrez, Bauer, Lobova, & Fleming, 2011). Overemphasizing the potential risks posed by bats to humans may generate unjustified alarmism, a fact that has raised considerable concern in conservationists (L\u00f3pez\u2010Baucells, Rocha, & Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Llamazares, 2017), as also highlighted by the EUROBATS agreement on the conservation of bat populations in Europe (working group on \u201cCommunication, Bat Conservation and Public Health\u201d). Under this perspective, surveillance may still be important to avoid or mitigate potential conflicts and eventually improve bat conservation policies.",

Most bats we screened were caught on emergence from their roosts with harp traps or at drinking sites with mist nets. In such cases, bats were promptly removed from the trap or the net and their forearm length and body mass were measured, respectively, with a caliper to the nearest 1 mm and a digital scale to the nearest 0.1 g. Sex was assessed by inspecting genitalia (Racey, 1988), and wings were trans\u2010illuminated to distinguish juveniles from adults (Anthony, 1988). In females, we ascertained pregnancy by palpation (Racey, 1988), and lactation by the presence of enlarged nipples surrounded by a hairless skin area and by extruding milk with a gentle finger pressure on the nipple base. Bats were immediately released after processing. A few samples came from animals hosted at rehabilitation centres. Saliva was sampled from each bat with a dry sterile swab, which was placed in viral transport medium (Chu, Poon, Guan, & Peiris, 2008), and transported in a cool box to the laboratory for the analysis. Bat droppings expelled during manipulation of specimens were collected, stored in sterile vials and preserved in cool boxes during transportation.",

Detection of astroviruses (AstVs) was performed with a nested protocol suing a set of conserved primer targeting the RdRp region (Chu et al., 2008) using 1 \u03bcl of RNA (Table 1). Screening for enteroviruses was carried out using a nested protocol (Iturriza\u2010Gomara, Megson, & Gray, 2006). The primer details and sequence are listed in Table 1. Positive controls for the various PCR assays included human (Mamastrovirus species 1) and canine astrovirus (Mamastrovirus species 5), bovine and canine CoVs and canine reovirus strains. Members of the Norovirus (genogroups II and IV) and Vesivirus genus (feline and canine strains) were used as positive control for the calicivirus PCR.

The RT\u2010PCR prevalence (22.45%) observed in our study was higher than that observed in Hungary (6.94%) (Kemenesi et al., 2014) and similar to that found in Germany (25.8%; Fischer et al., 2016). Studies in China identified AstV in 46% of the tested bats (Chu et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2011). The prevalence was also found to greatly vary by bat species (Fischer et al., 2017). As an example, a study carried out in China revealed the presence of Astrovirus in 83.3% of the samples of Myotis pylosus analysed, whilst the prevalence was found much lower for other species (Chu et al., 2008). To detect and characterize the AstV strains, we amplified and sequenced a fragment of 422 bp of the RdRp gene, which represents the most conserved region of the AstV genome. Upon sequence analysis, we observed a remarkable genetic diversity among the various bat AstV strains detected in Italy. Such a high degree of variation was observed also within species and in the same geographic area or colony. These findings do not confirm the bat species specificity of AstV, proposed by other authors (Fischer et al., 2016). Intriguingly, two AstV strains were virtually identical (100% nt) to each other in the fragment of the RdRp region, but they were identified from two different bat species, M. schreibersii and M. capaccinii.",

Avian AstVs have also been associated with extra\u2010intestinal diseases, such as nephritis in chicken (Imada et al., 2000) and hepatitis in ducks (Todd et al., 2009). Recently, AstVs have been also detected in the nervous tissues of minks with shaking disease (Blomstrom, Widen, Hammer, Belak, & Berg, 2010) and of bovines with neurological disorders (Bouzalas et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013). Neurological disease in immunocompromised human patients has been associated with AstV infection (Brown et al., 2015; Fremond et al., 2015; Lum et al., 2016; Quan et al., 2010). In our research, all the animals positive to AstV appeared healthy, as also reported in previous studies in bats (Fischer et al., 2017).

However, more information is needed on bat\u2010borne immune response to state whether these viruses are really nonpathogenic for bats.",
