However, we noted substantial year-to-year variability in the number of cases, with 73% of cases occurring during a single season, similar to previous observations [19] and other seasons with few or no detections. The annual variability seen in our study illustrates the risk of missing outbreaks of this disease with intermittent testing, highlighting the value of including influenza C in ongoing surveillance programs. Furthermore, while some previous reports suggested no seasonal pattern [31], studies from Japan [19] and Canada [30] have found peaks in the winter and spring seasons, which are consistent with our findings. We observed a peak from December 2014 to May 2015, overlapping with the seasonal peak for influenza A and B. Additional surveillance is needed to further clarify whether true seasonality exists.",

We showed a statistically higher percentage of influenza C virus detection in those aged 6 months to 2 years (1.22%), with lower rates of infection through the remainder of childhood and adulthood. There was also a lower rate of detection in those aged <6 months, corresponding to a time when children have residual maternal antibodies that could provide some immunological protection [32]. The lowest rates of detection occurred among teenagers, with slightly higher rates in adults, though this was not statistically significant. While we cannot rule out the possibility that rates of influenza C detection in adults were artificially low due to a bias against testing for respiratory pathogens in older age groups, another recent study found almost identical rates (0.3%) of influenza C infection in adults systematically tested for viral infection [33].",

Our observation that rates of influenza C virus detection decline with age fits with previous studies that demonstrated increased prevalence of influenza C antibodies with increasing age. Interestingly, 20% of our influenza C virus detections were among symptomatic adults. These data may suggest that while many adults have had prior exposure to influenza C virus, the immunological protection from past exposure may wane over time. Alternatively, it may be possible to have serial infections with antigenically distinct circulating lineages. The presence of at least 6 influenza C lineages raises the question of whether exposure to new strains might allow infection of previously exposed individuals. Consistent with reports from Japan [19], we identified 2 lineages\u2014C/Kanagawa and C/Sao Paulo\u2014that were cocirculating in our study population. The sample numbers were small, and we were unable to find any differences between strains with respect to age or geographic distribution (data not shown). Nevertheless, we did find the C/Kanagawa lineage more consistently among hospitalized cases. Ongoing testing through established surveillance systems will make it possible to identify the emergence of new antigenic lineages.",

We detected influenza C virus at similar rates in hospitalized cases and outpatients with ARI, raising the possibility that it may be associated with a spectrum of disease. The reasons for the variability of disease severity are likely multifactorial and may include both host and viral factors. From a host perspective, all cases admitted to the ICU had at least 1 underlying medical condition, suggesting that underlying illness is a risk factor for severe disease and consistent with literature on other respiratory infections such as RSV [34]. Specifically, prematurity was noted in 17% of all cases and 80% of cases admitted to the ICU. Interestingly, we observed prolonged shedding of virus in 2 cases with underlying medical illness. From a viral standpoint, many of our cases had coinfections, and we detected 2 circulating influenza C lineages, which may differ in pathogenicity. At this time, no specific antiviral therapy is available [35], so treatment is primarily supportive. Nevertheless, awareness of respiratory viral infections such as influenza C that are not currently detected on routine respiratory pathogen panels may inform hospital infection control policy and would support presumptive respiratory isolation based on symptoms, even in the setting of negative test result.",

            "text": "Although our study provides valuable information about naturally occurring influenza C virus detections, it has several limitations. First, clinical testing was done at the discretion of the treating clinician. Thus, some patients may not have had testing ordered or had a residual specimen for testing at MDH, leading to an underestimation of cases. A second caveat is that children, particularly those aged <1 year, are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory infections and therefore have respiratory specimens obtained for testing [36]. This is reflected in the fact that 57% of patients from the SARI surveillance program were aged <5 years. Third, no information was obtained about underlying medical conditions or follow-up data for outpatient cases, and thus, a comparative analysis of comorbidities and outcomes with SARI cases was not possible. Finally, influenza C virus was commonly codetected with other viral pathogens. When compared to culture-based methods, molecular detection methods such as ours frequently detect multiple infections, which poses a challenge to interpretation [37]. Viral nucleic acid may be detectable for prolonged periods of time, including in asymptomatic individuals, and it can be difficult to distinguish among symptomatic infection, asymptomatic shedding, and noninfectious viral debris [37]. Therefore, it will also be important to measure influenza C virus prevalence in asymptomatic controls to address the potential for asymptomatic shedding. Nevertheless, by conducting surveillance in a large population and by incorporating multiplexed testing for other known pathogens, we identified 24 cases with influenza C virus but no copathogens detected. This included 2 cases who became ill enough to warrant ICU admission. While we cannot rule out the possibility that another agent is the primary cause of symptoms, these data raise the possibility that influenza C virus has the potential to cause more disease than previously appreciated.",
