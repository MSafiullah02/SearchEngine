Diagnosis of fungal infection based on histology alone may not be as accurate due to the concomitant presence of acute or chronic rejection in these individuals. 24 Similarly, it is not only the unique clinical syndromes of fungal infection that set them apart from the other immunocompromised hosts, but the diagnostic utility of non-invasive testing also is different. Serum galactomannan has markedly lower sensitivity (30%) in lung transplant recipients as compared with other immunocompromised hosts. 63, 64 Similarly, the sensitivity of other serologic markers such as serum cryptococcal or coccidiodal antigen, histoplasma urine antigen may be variable.

Currently available \u2424-glucan is non-specific and is negative in cases of cryptococcosis and zygomycosis. 72 In a recent study of lung transplant recipients, serum \u2424-D-glucan sensitivity was reported to be 93%, whereas specificity was merely 71%. 73 The Mycoses Study Group (MSG) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) recently updated the definitions of fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts. 3 These definitions represent an excellent attempt to standardize the reporting of fungal infections in studies. However, they fail to address the unique nature of clinical syndromes in lung transplant recipients, particularly colonization, tracheobronchitis and bronchial anastomotic infections. 8, 74, 75 Also, the radiologic presentation of invasive mycoses in cardiothoracic organ transplant recipients may not conform to the classical \"halo sign\" presentation in neutropenic or stem a In the absence of biopsy categorize as probable: In the presence of histologic findings of both acute rejection and fungal invasion it should be classified as acute rejection with proven fungal infection. b The presence of mosaic appearance and ground-glass opacity may represent development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or obliterative bronchiolitis. c Isolation of non-pathogenic molds in culture (e.g., Cladosporium spp, Phialemonium, Chaetomium, Cunninghamella, Syncephalastrum, Curvularia, Dactylaria, Graphium or Phialophora) or other non-pathogenic fungi [e.g., Penicillium (non-Marnefii), Paecilomyces or basidiomyctes] do not qualify for the \"probable\" category.
