Although essential for preventing transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare institutions, patient isolation has recently been associated with adverse effects in patients, including the possibility of less than optimal care.3 For example, some have mentioned that the requirement to wear gown and gloves before patient examination may impede the physician\u2019s ability to perform adequate physical examination, or provide a disincentive for healthcare workers to enter patient rooms.4, 5 Similarly, other studies have pointed out the concern that isolation may negatively affect patients\u2019 mental health.6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n",

In Rees et al.\u2019s cohort where patients were isolated for different types of infections, they found that 12 of 21 patients had mood disturbances as evidenced by high HADS scores.37, 42 In Newton et al.\u2019s study, among a total of 19 patients, seven felt isolated and complained about lack of attention from nursing staff. Nevertheless 10 patients identified the positive impact of isolation including greater freedom and privacy. Interestingly, most of the patients did not have a clear understanding for the reason for isolation.36 Wilkins et al. had a cohort of 41 isolated patients.9 Their CCEI scores for anxiety and hysteria were found to be higher than that in the general population. Scores were also higher on admission than on discharge. Not surprisingly, history of mental illness was associated with higher scores for anxiety.",

Similarly, Kirkland and Weinstein also found that healthcare workers were about two times less likely to enter the room of patients in contact isolation, with mean room entry/h of 3.9 vs 7.9 (P\n = 0.06).5 Contact was also two-fold less in isolated patients, with mean contacts/h of 2.1 vs 4.2 (P\n = 0.03). The duration of interaction was not significantly different between isolated patients and controls (4.5 vs 2.8, P\n = 0.6). By contrast, Saint et al. found no difference in the number of examinations by senior medical residents among patients in isolation and controls [risk ratio (RR) = 0.96, P\n = 0.58].4 However, attending physicians examined patients in isolation less frequently than their non-isolated counterparts (RR = 0.49, P\n < 0.001).",

In addition, they had more days with either no nursing narrative notes (14 vs 10%, P\n < 0.001), or physician progress notes (26 vs 13%, P\n < 0.001) recorded in the chart. Isolated patients were twice as likely as control patients to experience adverse events per 1000 days (31 vs 15, P\n < 0.001). This reflected preventable (20 vs 3, P\n < 0.001) as opposed to non-preventable events (11 vs 12, P\n = 0.98). Specifically, patients in isolation were as much as eight times more likely to experience supportive care failures such as falls, ulcers, and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. There were no significant differences in terms of severity of adverse event or death. Not surprisingly, patients in isolation expressed greater dissatisfaction regarding their care, as reflected by both formal and informal complaints (30 vs 8%, P\n < 0.001).
