            "text": "In their fight for survival parasites depend absolutely on their ability to adapt themselves to the life cycle, behaviour, food and physiology of peculiar hosts and on their capacity to create sophisticated ways of host finding. Since all these tasks needed huge numbers of trials, evolution supported only the \u201cwinners\u201d and suppressed as \u201closers\u201d all less well-adapted specimens. Therefore it is not astonishing that these winners developed admirable skills that are listed as top records in the scorebook of nature being often unbelievable when compared to the range of human skills. However, the fight for survival is never finally decided, especially not for those parasites that may harm the health of humans and animals, since human science declared war on these \u201cbeasts\u201d that may endanger human survival on earth. We are now in round 11 out of 12 in the fight for survival \u2013 nothing has been decided, since vector-transmitted viruses lurk everywhere in a globalized world. The sudden outbreak of the West Nile virosis in the USA (transmitted by mosquitoes), the unexpected outbreak of Blue Tongue virosis in 2006 in Central Europe (transmitted by Ceratopogonid midges), or the pandemics of the virus-based disease SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), \u201cbird flu\u201d and \u201cpig flu\u201d prove that we live on very thin ice or on a still silent volcano.",

This type of cell invasion needs a very skilful system of functional organelles, which produce substances that allow penetration and feeding (e.g. conoid, rhoptries, micronemes, dense bodies, apicoplast, micropores etc.).\n",

In these cases the membrane of an original parasitophorous vacuole becomes underlaid by dense material thus forming the so-called primary cyst wall (PCW), in addition this PCW may form a wall of upright protrusions, which block attacks from the outside, but also enable an increased uptake of food from the cytoplasm of the host cell (Fig. 3.3c).",

The oocysts contain (like a Russian doll) other fortified systems such as wall-surrounded sporocysts, which offer excellent protection outside of a host and thus guarantee survival even during heat, dryness or coldness. Thus, these stages may survive for a long time outside of a host\u2019s body. While bacteria might harm the walls, these oocysts and sporocysts (Fig. 3.3d) are stored in laboratories inside fluids containing potassium bichromate or 1\u20134% of different acids, which would considerably harm human skin in case of contact.",
