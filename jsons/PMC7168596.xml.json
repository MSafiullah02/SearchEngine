Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are the most common viral agents associated with ARIs, accounting for around 70% of all ARIs [1]. All these viral pathogens are associated with acute lower respiratory infections and create a substantial burden of disease, particularly in young children (<5 years), older individuals (\u226565 years) and immune-compromised patients. HMPV has been detected in 4\u201316% of hospitalizations of children suffering from ARIs. Serologic surveys revealed that primary HMPV infection is common, as antibodies were detected in over 90% of individuals between 5 and 10 years of age [2,3].",

Outbreaks occur mainly in the winter and spring months in the northern hemisphere and between June and July in the southern hemisphere. [4,5]. HMPV is a recent virus of the genus Metapneumovirus, belonging to the family Pneumoviridae. It was first isolated and identified in 2001 in the Netherlands in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children and adults with acute respiratory tract infections. HMPV hospitalization rates were the highest among children <2 years of age (200 of 100,000 person-year) and is lower among children between 5 and 17 years of age (5 of 100,000). HMPV has been associated with symptoms ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infections (cough, fever, wheezing, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, cyanosis, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea) and more severe ones (bronchiolitis and pneumonia) [6,7,8].",

Influenza monitoring health units capture all probable cases of influenza on the national influenza platform and only take 10% of samples of patients with influenza-like diseases and 100% samples of patients with severe acute respiratory Infection. These health units are distributed throughout the country and include different sectors within the Ministry of Health (National Institute of Social Security for State workers, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Petroleos Mexicanos, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy). The surveillance of non-influenza respiratory viruses is conducted in the country based on samples of hospitalized patients and deaths that meet the operational definition of severe acute respiratory infection. From 2009 to 2018, 188,076 hospitalized cases and 16,812 deaths were registered on the national influenza platform, of which 111,260 and 8586, respectively, tested negative for influenza. Of the 119,846 samples of hospitalized patients and deaths throughout the health sector, 7283 (6%) samples were processed with the objective of identifying respiratory etiologic agents and determining the epidemiological behavior of HMPV in influenza-negative samples from hospitalized and deceased patients in Mexico between 2009 and 2018. The results of this study aim to raise awareness among clinicians about the impact of HMPV on severe acute respiratory infections, mainly among young children and older people. ",
