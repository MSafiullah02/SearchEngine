Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the \"static service operations\" to become the \"bring-service-near-your-home\" mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-costsubsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers. Finally, we study the optimal safety technology investment problem.",

            "text": "Imagine that we operate a private tutorial school in an indoor shopping mall for students (P.S.: mainly children) learning piano for professional public examinations in a city like Hong Kong. Teaching is commonly held in a way in which one teacher coaches one student inside a very small room with the piano. For this type of static service operation (SSO), during the normal period of time, the school is very popular and it is a very solid commercial service operation. However, during the recent corona virus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) outbreak (CVO), students (as well as their parents if the students are children) deeply worry about attending the piano class in the music school because: (i) It is indoor and a lot of students come and go. (ii) Visiting the school requires traveling which usually involves public transport. (iii) Precaution measures may not be trusted as they cannot clearly see if the school has done a good job. As a result, most students will refuse to attend class anymore and the private tutorial school deeply suffers as the rental fee is very high in Hong Kong and the service provider will go bankrupt very soon if no solutions are found. Table 1 .1 shows the points that consumers commonly believe under the corona virus outbreak in a city like Hong Kong. All these points are very logical but they will create big troubles. In fact, the case described above is very common. Unlike many other classroom teaching (such as English or Mathematics), teaching piano is not going to be effective without practicing and trying in front of the piano. Moreover, many students do not have pianos at home in Hong Kong which makes it impossible to have online class/demonstration. The outbreak hence creates a huge problem as both the service provider (e.g., the private school) will go bankrupt and the consumers (e.g., students) will suffer. This is a terrible situation. Recently, Hong Kong Apple Daily 4 reported a real case in which a private music school (just like the one we mentioned above) has innovatively changed its operations mode to be \"mobile\". To be specific, the private school rents a long truck, renovates it and makes it a mobile classroom. The school hence becomes a mobile service operation (MSO) 5 and establishes the \"bring-service-near-your-home\" business model.",

The hygiene level is kept at a high level. All students have to be tested with body temperature and must wear surgical masks. The psychological worries of students are hence much reduced. The response is very positive as the private music school claims that it can \"continue to operate\" and students can continue to learn piano without big disruptions. This is hence a highly desirable win-win scenario. 3 Many points are in fact governed by laws. For example, in Hong Kong, as a temporary and special measure, public gatherings of four or more people are banned during CVO. 4 26 March 2020, Apple Daily (Hong Kong).

As we will show in the following analyses, our analyses indicate that the MSO business model is really an interesting idea and it can potentially overcome the huge challenge brought by CVO which may very likely lead to the failure of the service operations. Moreover, we find that governments can impose effective measures to support the service provider. Different measures have different effects. It is interesting to find that the commonly seen and well-proposed subsidy for the lump-sum fixed cost (called the FCS scheme) is in fact inferior to the sponsorship scheme which subsidizes the per unit operations cost (called the OCS scheme) because consumers will be benefited under the OCS scheme, but not the FCS scheme. Alternatively, the non-monetary sponsor scheme such as the safetytechnology-support (STS) scheme may also serve the purpose. In the extended analyses, we prove that the qualitative conclusion under the endogenous service fee (i.e. revenue) case remains valid when the service fee is assumed to be \"exogenous\" (i.e., cannot be changed when the firm adopts MSO under CVO). We also derive the situations in which the MSO business model is financially viable in the long run. Last but not least, considering the scenario in which the service provider (i.e., the firm) can invest in safety technologies to reduce consumers' worries under MSO, we analytical find the closed-form solution for the optimal safety technology investment level and highlight its relationship with, e.g., the unit operations cost under MSO.",

In the literature, for general service operations, analytically examine the service operations platforms. The authors highlight the \"value-added service\" provided by the platforms. Wang et al. (2019) investigate the optimal \"service order allocation\" problem. The authors uncover the role played by risk attitudes. Most recently, Choi et al.

The authors propose the use of blockchain as a technological tool to help implement the customized pricing scheme with respect to risk attitudes of individual consumer groups.

For instance, in Hong Kong, we have mobile libraries, mobile Chinese medical service trucks, mobile insurance and financial service trucks, and even Red Cross has the mobile trucks to serve as the blooddonation stations. As a consequence, the MSO business models do exist in the world before we have the disasters. However, when we face a disaster like CVO, using transportation logistics to provide MSO is still a solid proposal. We argue that across different industries, such as fashion tailors, boutiques (Choi et al. 2017) , hair stylists, fashion beauty and massage, medical doctors, drawing classes, etc. which involve personal face-to-face advice or interactions (e.g., measurements by tailors or diagnosis by medical doctors), the MSO business model may work under CVO type of disasters.",

At that time, consumers can come out but they may and further studies are needed to find an alternative solution. Operational risk (Choi et al. 2008; Chiu and Choi 2016; Xue et al. 2016; Araz et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020b ) is an important topic for service operations under disasters such as CVO, which deserves deeper exploration in the future (Chiu et al. 2018; Sun et al. 2018; Guo and Liu 2020) . As service operations under disaster may involve many psychological effects such as worries, in this paper, we simply model them using relatively simple mathematical models. Further studies can investigate them from a multi-methodological approach Li et al. 2019 ), e.g., with the collection of behavioral data from human subjects to fit into the analytical models.

Traditionally, in operation management, a lot of studies focus on optimal disaster responses and humanitarian activities/services. For instance,Balcik et al. (2019) study the \"collaborative prepositioning network design\" in response to disasters in a region.Kim et al. (2019) explore the optimal choice of \"logistics service providers\" to prepare for disasters. study the optimal \"temporary facility location\" problem to cope with disasters. The authors focus on the \"casualty allocation planning\" from the perspective of medical operations.Mejia et al. (2019) study the use of platforms to collect donation for helping emergency events such as disasters. Adopting the data analytics approach (Schoenherr and Speier-Pero 2015; Choi et al. 2018; Kuo and Kusiak 2019), Yan et al. (2019) investigate the use of social media analytics to enhance \"disaster management\". Sheu and Choi (2020) study the widely seen strategic hoarding problems when disasters happen. Ye et al. (2019) review the literature and cases on inventory management of \"relief-resources\". Most recently, Ivanov (2020) conduct a simulation studyto uncover how influences brought by CVO on the global supply chain system. This paper also examines operations under disasters and the specific emphasis is on the global CVO problem. However, it focuses on exploring how the \"suppose-to-disrupted\" service operations may be able to recover by an innovative change of business model with the use of transportation logistics and technologies. To the best of my knowledge, this has never been studied in the literature.CVO is an event, which creates big challenges to operations(Araz et al. 2020). In the literature, disaster related event studies have been published over the past few decades. We review a few related studies that are published in recent years. For instance,Jacob and Singhal (2017) empirically study whether the market reacts negatively towards the \"Rana Plaza disaster\" in the Bangladeshi apparel manufacturing industry by conducting an event study. The authors focus on exploring the stock market's reaction using the standard empirical event study methodology in operations management.",

In case when MSO is not financially viable, as it is still beneficial to consumers if MSO can be offered (as SSO definitely cannot run owing to the danger of being infected as well as the very big consumers' psychological worry), we suggest the government to provide subsidy to the firm to support MSO. There are three government subsidy schemes and we have shown that the OCS scheme outperforms the FCS scheme as it can bring benefits to both the firm and consumers. Moreover, an alternative non-monetary scheme, termed as the STS scheme, may also be applied. In the extended analyses, we first consider the case when service fee (i.e. revenue) is \"exogenous\" (i.e., cannot be changed when the firm adopts MSO under CVO). We have shown that the main conclusions under the endogenous service fee case remain valid. After that, we have explored the issue of whether it is wise for the firm to consider implementing the MSO business model in the long run, i.e., not just for the case when the disaster comes.
