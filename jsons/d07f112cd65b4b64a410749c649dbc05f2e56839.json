At the same time, the nascent field of metagenomics began, with numerous studies highlighting the power of survey sequencing of DNA and RNA from samples as diverse as the human gut and Antarctic soil [4, 5] . As the diversity and sizes of such datasets expand, the utility of searching them with a novel sequence increases. Meta-metagenomic searches are currently under-utilized--in principle such searches would involve direct access to sequence data from a large set of metagenomic experiments on a terabyte scale, along with software able to search for similarity to a query sequence. Neither of these aspects of meta-metagenomic searches is infeasible with current data transfer and processing speeds. In this communication, we report the results of searching the recently-described 2019-nCoV coronavirus sequence through a set of metagenomic datasets with the tag \"virome\".",

The latter sequence data were downloaded as .sra files using the prefetch tool, with extraction to readable format (.fasta.gz) using the NCBI fastq-dump tool. Each of these manipulations can fail some fraction of the time, in the former case due to network issues and for unknown reasons in the latter case. Thus the workflow continually requests .sra files with prefetch until at least some type of file is obtained, and attempts to unpack into .fasta.gz format until at least one such file is obtained from each .sra file. Metagenomic datasets for analysis were chosen through a keyword search of the SRA descriptions for \"virome\". The \"virome\" keyword search will certainly not capture every metagenomic dataset with viral sequences, and likewise not capture every virus in the short sequence read archive. These datasets were downloaded between January 27 and January 31, 2020. With up to 16 threads running simultaneously, total download time (prefetch) was approximately 2 days, with a similar time required for conversion to gzipped fasta files. A total of 9014 sequence datasets were downloaded and converted to fasta.gz files, although a small fraction of these contained very little data (only a few reads or reads of at most a few base pairs). Most files contained large numbers of reads and the total dataset consists of 2.5TB of compressed sequence data, with total bases covered approaching 10TB.",

As a reference, and to benchmark the workflow further, we included several additional sequences in the query (Vaccinia virus, an arbitrary segment of a flu isolate, the full sequence of bacteriophage P4, and a number of putative polinton sequences from Caenorhabditis briggsae ). The relatively small group of k-mers being queried (<10 6 ) allows a rapid search for homologs. This was implemented in a Python script run using the PyPy accelerated interpreter. We stress that this is by no means the most comprehensive or fastest search for large datasets, but it rapidly finds any closely matching sequence, with the downloading and conversion of the data, rather than the search, being rate limiting.",

We thus set a threshold requiring matching of a perfect 32-nucleotide segment with a granularity of 8 nucleotides in the search (i.e., interrogating the complete database of k-mers from the virus with k-mers starting at nucleotide 1, 9, 17, 25, 33 of each read from the metagenomic data for a perfect match).

From the quick k-mer search, an initial indicator can be inferred from the number of matching reads and k-mer match counts for those reads [ Table 1, Supplementary Table 1 ]. For the 2019-nCoV matches amongst the available metagenomic datasets, the strongest and most abundant matches in these analyses come from the pangolin lung metaviromes. The matches are observed throughout the 2019-nCoV query sequence and many of the matching reads show numerous matching 32-mer sequences. The vast majority of matches were in two lung samples with small numbers of matches in two additional lung datasets. No matches were detected for five additional lung datasets, and no matches were seen in eight spleen samples and a lymph node sample. Further analysis of coverage and homology through alignment of the entire metagenomic datasets revealed an extensive, if incomplete, coverage of the 2019-nCoV genome [ Figure 1a ]. Percent nucleotide similarity can be calculated for pangolin metavirome reads aligning to 2019-nCoV [ Figure 1b ], and these segmental homologies consistently show strong matches, approaching (but still overall weaker than) the similarity of the closest known bat coronavirus (RaTG13).",

            "text": "Meta-meta-genomic searching can provide unique opportunities to understand the distribution of nucleic acid sequences in diverse environmental niches. As metagenomic datasets proliferate and as both the need and capability to identify pathogenic agents through sequencing grows, meta-metagenomic searching may prove extremely useful in tracing the origins and spreading of causative agents. In the example we present in this paper, such a search identifies a number of niches with sequences matching the genome of the recent 2019-nCoV virus, in so doing raising a number of relevant points for the origin of 2019-nCoV. Before describing the details of these points, however, it is important to stress that while environmental, clinical, and animal-based sequencing is valuable in understanding how viruses traverse the animal ecosphere, static sequence distributions cannot be used to construct a virus' full transmission history amongst different biological niches. So even were the closest relative of a virus causing disease in species X to be found in species Y, we cannot define the source of the outbreak, or the direction(s) of transmission. As some viruses may move more than once between hosts, the sequence of a genome at any time may reflect a history of selection and drift in several different host species. This point is also accentuated in the microcosm of our searches for this work. When we originally obtained the 2019-nCoV sequence from the posted work of Wu et al., we recapitulated their result that bat-SL-CoVZC45 was the closest related sequence in NCBI's non-redundant (nr/nt) database. Several pangolin metavirome sequences-which are not currently in the (nr/nt) database-are more closely related to 2019-nCoV than bat-SL-CoVZC45. An assumption that the closest relative of a sequence identifies the origin would at that point have transferred the extant model to zoonosis from pangolin instead of bat. To complicate such a model, an additional study from Zhou et al. [2] described a previously unpublished Coronavirus sequence, designated RaTG13 with much stronger homology to 2019-nCoV than either bat-SL-CoVZC45 or the pangolin reads from Liu et al. While this observation certainly shifts the discussion (legitimately) toward a possible bat-borne intermediate in the chain leading to 2019-nCoV, it remains difficult to determine if any of these are true intermediates in the chain of infectivity.",

That work describes analyses indicating several coronaviruses present in two of the pangolin lungs as well as other viral species. The pangolins appear to have died from lung-related illness, which may have involved the 2019-nCoV closely-related virus. Notably, however, two of the deceased pangolin lungs had much lower coronavirus signals, while five showed no signal, with sequencing depths in the various lungs roughly comparable. Although it remains possible that the coronavirus was the primary cause of death for these animals, it is also possible (as noted by Liu et al. [3] ) that the virus was simply present in the tissue, with mortality due to another virus, a combination of infectious agents, or other exposures.",

Matthew Wong and colleagues bring up the homology to the Pangolin metagenomic dataset in this thread and appears to have encountered it through a more targeted search than ours. Several models are discussed in this forum, in parallel to discussions in the virology community, as to the source of 2019-nCoV. The availability of numerous paths (both targeted and agnostic) toward identification of natural niches for pathogenic sequences will remain useful to the scientific community and to public health, as will vigorous sharing of ideas, data, and discussion of potential origins and modes of spread for epidemic pathogens.",

The total number of aligned reads from the three samples was 1107, 313 and 32 reads respectively. (b) Quantification of nucleotide-level similarity between the 2019-nCoV genome and pangolin lung metavirome reads aligning to the 2019-nCoV genome. Average similarity was calculated in 101-nucleotide windows along the 2019-nCoV genome, and is only shown for those windows where each nucleotide in the window had coverage \u2265 2. Average nucleotide similarity calculated (in 101-nucleotide windows) between the 2019-nCoV genome and reference genomes of three relevant bat coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45: accession MG772933.1, bat-SL-CoVZXC21: accession MG772934.1, RaTG13: accession MN996532.1)is also shown. Note that the Pangolin metavirome similarity trace is not directly comparable to the bat coronavirus similarity traces, because the former uses read data for calculation whereas the latter use reference genomes.",
