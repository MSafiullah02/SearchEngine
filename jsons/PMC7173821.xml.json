The consequences for mental health services are already being felt (eg, increased workloads and the need to find new ways of working). Some services are developing expertise in conducting psychiatric assessments and delivering interventions remotely (eg, by telephone or digitally); these new working practices should be implemented more widely, but with consideration that not all patients will feel comfortable with such interactions and they may present implications for privacy.
