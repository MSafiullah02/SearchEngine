Existing studies show that the cardiovascular disease increased the incidence and severity of coronavirus infection. At the same time, myocardial injury caused by coronavirus infection is one of the main factors contributing to poor prognosis. In this review, the recent clinical findings about the relationship between coronaviruses and cardiovascular diseases and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. This review aimed to provide assistance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

Cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after COVID-19 [128] [129] [130] . And SARS-CoV-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury [60, 128] . According to the study by Li et al., the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury[13]. Serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin I (Hs-TnI) and creatine kinase (CK) increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of COVID-19 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [131] [132] [133] [134] . However, the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases, approximately 22.2% to 31% [9, 12, 126, 133, 134] , than in patients with mild cases, approximately 2% to 4% [9, 10] . The percentage of heart injury in COVID-19 patients who died, approximately 28% to 89% [12, 13, 132] , was higher than that in those who survived. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were also reported to be increased[13, 134, 135] . Increased Hs-TnI and proBNP expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of COVID-19 [133] [134] [135] . Furthermore, it was found that high Hs-TnI levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased levels of immunity (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response [131, 132] (Table 2) .",

Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, accounting for more than 97% of the samples isolated from around the world. And the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters: a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from Western hemisphere (Subtypes II, VI, IX, X and XI) and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from Western and Eastern hemispheres (Subtypes I, III, IV, V, VII, VIII, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XVI) [137] .

This comparison suggests that the L type was significantly more prevalent in Wuhan than in other places. And recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan [9] [10] [11] 139] or outside Wuhan [134, 140, 141] have showed that the mortality of COVID-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside Wuhan was lower than that in Wuhan (Table 3) . Although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of COVID-19 in and outside Wuhan, such as the shortage of medical resources in Wuhan, the role of different SARS-CoV-2 subtypes cannot be ignored. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 subtypes and the mortality of COVID-19 or the CVD complications need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.",

Hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the body's anaerobic digestion. Acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane. As hypoxia continues, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly, leading to a series of cell damage processes, including apoptosis [169] . At the same time, hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions, such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines, leading to further tissue ischemia, and may even cause myocardial infarction[13, 170, 171] .",

            "text": "Previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome [172, 173] , arrhythmia [174] , and exacerbation of heart failure [175] , mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque, along with other effects [176] [177] [178] . Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), TNF, IL-1 and IL-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 and interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) in SARS patients and experimental animal models infected with SARS-CoV [179, 180] . TNF and IL-1 family and IL-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure, and they have obvious negative inotropic effects, which may explain heart failure complications in SARS infection [181] . The acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to SARS infection [30] . There is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by SARS-CoV is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines [95, 96] . The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in SARS-CoV-infected mice. Treatment with drugs that inhibited NF-\u03baB activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both SARS-CoV-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after SARS-CoV infection, indicating that the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after SARS-CoV infection and that NF-\u03baB inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by SARS-CoV and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses [182] .",

High plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias. The activated SNS alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes, contributing to CVD development .",

Multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients using ventilator was still high [213] [214] [215] . And it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with COVID-19, which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50% [216] . New guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with COVID-19. We advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator. Simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effective.",

These data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients.
