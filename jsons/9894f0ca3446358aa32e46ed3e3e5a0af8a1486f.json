Transmission of MERS-CoV is categorized as zoonotic, with repeated introductions into the human population after contact with infected dromedaries, resulting in limited human-to-human transmission, notably in healthcare settings [1] The MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea in 2015, resulting in 186 cases and 38 deaths [2] , reminds us that the introduction of a single case into an unsuspecting healthcare system can trigger a very large outbreak with serious public health and socioeconomic consequences.",

We have suspected, and our involvement in several missions to affected countries in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and South Korea has confirmed, that delayed recognition and slow isolation of infected patients, extended stays in overcrowded emergency rooms, and suboptimal adherence to infection prevention and control procedures have been responsible for secondary cases in these settings [3] , but the role of environmental contamination has received relatively little attention. Researchers in Korea have recently published studies [4, 5] evaluating environmental and/or air contamination by MERS-CoV and should be commended for their efforts to evaluate the hospital outbreaks in their country.",

Some concerns have been expressed that the claimed \"virus isolation\" did not yield virus isolates but rather was based on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction detection of infected cells [7] . Kim et al [4] did go further to demonstrate passage of virusinfected cells leading to detectable viral antigen detection, which is better evidence of replicating virus. We are aware of a number of other environmental studies conducted in hospitals that have found surface contamination but have not been able to isolate virus from air samples. These studies have not yet been published in the peer-reviewed literature. It is important that these and any negative results are also published, or else we will be left with a skewed selection of positive findings. The partial inconsistencies in results between studies will need further examination. In particular, it is important that future studies include \"negative controls\" with comparable sampling and testing strategies applied in settings where patients with MERS were not housed.",
