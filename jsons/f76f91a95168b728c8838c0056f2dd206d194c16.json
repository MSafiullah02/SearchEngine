comparative research of primate viral infections of monkeys and humans are presented. These data are interesting for the characterization of monkeys as an object in medical-biological research. Also, they are important for preventing epizooty and infection of personnel contacting with monkeys in a monkey colony. The characterization of spontaneous infections in monkeys is very important for further use of monkeys as models of analogous human infections. The similar to human manifestations of the most part of these infections can be reproduced in monkeys that is explained by evolutionary established similarity of main physiological systems of monkeys and humans. The evolutional similarity of infectious agents, seemingly duplicates of human viruses, should be also taken into account. The contribution made by monkeys to research of human virus pathology is invaluable. The use of these laboratory primates helped to prove etiology of the most part of viral infections, to study their pathogenesis and epidemiology, and to develop the preventive care. The care and use of the monkeys are carried out in accordance with the rules of the humane care of animals in Russia (and in USSR) and with approved experimental protocols. Studies of viral pathology were started at Sukhum Medical-Biological Station of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences in 1950s.
