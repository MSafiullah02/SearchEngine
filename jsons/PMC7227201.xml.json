SARS-CoV-2 preferentially proliferates in type II alveolar cells (AT2) and peaks of viral shedding appear 3\u20135 days after the onset of disease. Therefore, if the nucleic acid tests are negative in the beginning, specimen collection and testing should continue on subsequent days. The results of radiology shows that SARS-CoV-2 infected lesions are often located in the lung periphery and both lower lobes, far away from the airway. The main manifestation is dry cough with quite different amounts of virus excretion in each sputum sample. Therefore, patients should be instructed to perform a deep cough 3\u20135 times and try their best to cough up deep sputum. Samples should be taken multiple times continuously when necessary to improve the positive rate of detection.",

So it is necessary to be aware of the potential risk of infectiousness of the patients\u2019 feces. The combined detection of respiratory tract specimens, feces, blood, and other types of specimens is important to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of suspected cases and to monitor the curative effect. Detection of specific immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G in peripheral blood is also helpful for the diagnosis of disease. Fecal virus nucleic acids should be tested before a patient is discharged. If the feces continuously show high levels of positive nucleic acids, virus cultivation will be helpful to confirm. Then post-discharge isolation management measures can be made accordingly.",
