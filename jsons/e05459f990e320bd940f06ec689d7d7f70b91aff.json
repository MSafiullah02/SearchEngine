In a pattern typical of many developing areas, infant and child mortality rates in The Gambia are high, acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of death, and pneumococcus is the most common cause of these infections. Results of a 4-year, randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that the vaccine reduced childhood mortality by 16% in children who received the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The vaccine contained 9 of the pneumococcal serotypes (subtypes) that are most common in The Gambia. The vaccine was 77% effective in preventing infections caused by the vaccine serotypes (www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/gambia). The Gambia Pneumococcal Vaccine Trial was the first major randomized, controlled vaccine clinical trial in nearly 20 years to show a statistically significant reduction in overall child mortality. Findings indicate that vaccinating infants against Streptococcus pneumoniae could substantially reduce death and illness among children in developing countries, including in rural areas with limited access to public health systems.
