            "text": "During the infection of cells by animal viruses, membrane permeability is modified at two different steps of the virus life cycle (Carrasco, 1995) (Figure 6 .1). Initially, when the virion enters cells, a number of different-sized molecules are able to co-enter the cytoplasm with the virus particles (Fernandez-Puentes and Otero and Carrasco, 1987) . Membrane potential is reversibly destroyed, being restored several minutes later. Endosomes are involved in the co-entry process, since inhibitors of the proton ATPase block early permeabilization even with viruses that do not require endosomal function. A chemiosmotic model has been advanced to explain the molecular basis of early membrane modification by virus particles (Carrasco, 1994) . The viral molecules involved are components of virions: glycoproteins when enveloped particles are analyzed or, still unidentified, domains of the structural proteins in the case of naked viruses. Attachment of the particle to the cell surface receptor does not alter membrane permeability by itself. Inhibitors that hamper virus decapsidation, still allowing virus attachment to the cell surface, block early membrane permeabilization (Almela et al., 1991) .",

This is the case of hygromycin B, anthelmycin, blasticidin S, destomycin A, gougerotin, and edein complex. The aminoglycoside antibiotic hygromycin B (MW 527) is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. This hydrophilic molecule is an efficient inhibitor of protein synthesis in cell-free systems but interferes very poorly with translation in intact cells. However, the modification of the plasma membrane by viruses or by other means leads to a rapid blockade of translation (Carrasco, 1995) . Concentrations of the antibiotic ranging from about 0.1-1 mM are added to the culture medium and protein synthesis is estimated by incubation with radioactive methionine for 1 hr (see Figure 6 .2) (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2001) . In addition to its simplicity, the hygromycin B test has a number of advantages for assaying changes in membrane permeability. One is its great sensitivity, and another is that this test measures membrane modifications only in cells that are metabolically active. Moreover, in cultures where some cells are uninfected, hygromycin B would only enter virus-infected cells that are synthesizing proteins. The hygromycin B test has been applied with success to prokaryotic (Lama and Carrasco, 1992) and eukaryotic cells, including yeast Carrasco, 1995, 1998) and mammalian cells (Gatti et al., 1998; Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2001) .

This protein inhibits translation by modifying ribosomes in an enzymatic manner. Thus, a molecule of alpha-sarcin is able to inactivate a great number of ribosomes by hydrolysis of the A4324-G4325 phosphodiester bond in the 28S rRNA (Chan et al., 1983) . This toxin does not enter mammalian cells because it does not attach to the cell surface and is therefore unable to cross the plasma membrane. However, alpha-sarcin efficiently interferes with protein synthesis in cell-free systems or in cells where the permeability barrier has been destroyed (Fernandez-Puentes and . Alpha-sarcin co-enters cells in conjunction with virus particles, and is liberated to the cytoplasm (Otero and Carrasco, 1987; Liprandi et al., 1997) . In this manner, this toxin irreversibly blocks translation several minutes after virus entry. The molecular basis of the co-entry of macromolecules with virus particles has been analyzed in detail elsewhere (Carrasco, 1994 (Carrasco, , 1995 . Apart from alpha-sarcin, a number of proteins that interfere with translation, many of them of plant origin, have been described (Fernandez-Puentes and Carrasco, 1980; Lee et al., 1990) . The release of all these toxins into cells is enhanced by virus particles. Not only proteins, but also other macromolecules, including nucleic acids efficiently co-enter with virus particles (Cotten et al., 1992) .

It should be noted that the entry of these compounds, in fact, determines a modification in cell membranes, which in some cases does not directly correlate with cell death. Trypan blue is a dye widely used for monitoring enhanced membrane permeability. However, this assay is not very sensitive. In addition, trypan blue staining does not discriminate between metabolically active or dead cells, as the hygromycin B tests does. Another assay employs the polyamine neurobiotin that needs specific connexin channels to enter mammalian cells (Elfgang et al., 1995) .

Typically, viroporins are comprised of some 60-120 amino acids. The hydrophobic domain is able to form an amphipathic \u2423-helix. The insertion of these proteins into membranes followed by their oligomerization creates a hydrophilic pore. The architecture of this channel is such that the hydrophobic amino acid residues face the phospholipid bilayer while the hydrophilic residues form part of the pore. In addition to this domain, there are other features of viroporin structure, including a second hydrophobic region in some viroporins that also interacts with membranes. This second interaction may further disturb the organization of the lipid bilayer. These proteins may also contain a stretch of basic amino acids that acts in a detergent-like fashion. All these structural features contribute to membrane destabilization. More recently, another domain has been described in some glycoproteins and also viroporins that has the capacity to interact with membranes. This domain is rich in aromatic amino acids and is usually inserted at the interface of the phospholipid bilayer (Suarez et al., 2000; Sanz et al., 2003) . This type of interaction also leads to membrane destabilization, further enhancing membrane permeability.",

            "text": "The architecture of some viral glycoproteins is such that upon oligomerization, the transmembrane (TM) domains may form a physical pore. In principle, two different regions of a viral fusion glycoprotein could form pores. One such region contains the fusion peptide that would create a pore in the cell membranes upon insertion (Skehel and Wiley, 1998) , while the TM domain would form a pore in the virion membrane (Wild et al., 1994) . Moreover, sequences adjacent to the TM region could have motifs designed to destabilize membrane structure (Suarez et al., 2000) . Entry of enveloped animal viruses leads to early membrane permeabilization, which is mediated by the formation of the two pores (fusion and TM) formed by viral fusion glycoproteins. This early permeabilization induced during the entry of virions requires conformational changes of the fusion glycoproteins. By contrast, after virus replication, newly synthesized glycoproteins may affect membrane permeability when they reach the plasma membrane (Figure 6 .3). This modification is achieved only by the TM domain, while the fusion peptide does not participate in this late modification. In viruses that lack the typical viroporin, its function could be replaced by these pore-forming glycoproteins, while for other viruses viroporin activity may be redundant (Bour and Strebel, 1996) . In the latter case, pore formation may be generated by viral glycoproteins and viroporins (Figure 6 .3). We would like to propose the possibility that pore-forming glycoproteins play a key role mainly during virus entry and, in some cases, also during virus budding, while viroporins come into action when viruses need to exit the cell.",

In the case of enveloped viruses, this early event is executed by a structural glycoprotein, which is coupled to the fusion process. An understanding of fusion at the molecular level also requires an explanation of the phenomenon of early membrane permeabilization. We have advanced the idea that viral glycoproteins involved in membrane fusion participate in the dissipation of the chemiosmotic gradient, thus providing the energy to push the nucleocapsid and neighboring macromolecules to the cell interior (Carrasco, 1994; Irurzun et al., 1997) . Fusion glycoproteins do not simply serve to bridge the cellular and the viral membrane, but instead are designed to open pores in both membranes. This pore-opening activity may be necessary to lower membrane potential and to dissipate ionic gradients. Several chapters of this book are devoted to the detailed description of the structure and function of these glycoproteins, so we will focus our attention on viral glycoproteins that permeabilize membranes when individually expressed in cells. These membrane active proteins may exhibit this activity later on in the virus life cycle.",

One such approach makes use of inhibitors of cellular or viral functions that do not permeate easily into intact animal cells. Notably, these agents selectively enter into virus-infected cells (Carrasco, 1978; Benedetto et al., 1980) . Most of the inhibitors used thus far interfere with protein synthesis, although compounds that affect other functions could also be employed. Entry of these agents leads to the inhibition of translation specifically in virus-infected cells, leading to a profound inhibition of virus growth (Contreras et al., 1978; Carrasco, 1995; Gatti et al., 1998) . Although this approach discriminates well between uninfected or virus-infected cells in culture, the high toxicity of the agents thus far assayed has hampered its use in whole animals. Perhaps future searches for less toxic compounds would make this approach amenable to application in therapy. In fact, some of the plant toxins that co-enter with virus particles have been described as being antiviral agents (Lee et al., 1990) . Even compounds such as hygromycin B, which has been used in the veterinary field as an antibacterial agent, could also be used as an antiviral compound for rotavirus infections (Liprandi et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "Much effort has been concentrated recently on the development of antiviral agents that inhibit the fusion step of HIV. Binding of HIV gp120 to the CD4 receptor is followed by further interaction of this viral glycoprotein with the coreceptor molecules CXCR4 and CCR5. After this initial interaction, the conformation of the ectodomain of the TM glycoprotein gp41 is profoundly modified. Exposure of the fusion peptide at the amino terminus of gp41 triggers its insertion into the target cellular membrane, leading to the fusion of the viral and the cellular plasma membranes. All these steps have been used as targets for anti-HIV therapy (Cooley and Lewin, 2003) . As regards the fusion step, a variety of peptide mimetic inhibitors have been developed. The pioneering work on peptide T20 has demonstrated that this compound is a potent inhibitor of gp41-induced membrane fusion. T20 exhibits antiviral activity in HIV-infected patients. The detailed mechanism of action of T20 at the molecular level is known. This peptide is homologous with 36 amino acids within the C-terminal heptad repeat region (HR2) of HIV-1 gp41. T20 competitively binds to HR1 and interferes with the formation of the six helix HR1-HR2 bundle complex necessary for membrane fusion. At present there are a great number of peptides that interfere with binding of gp120 or with gp41-induced membrane fusion and that have been tested for their anti-HIV activity and clinical efficacy. In this regard, T1249 is one of the second generation of HR-2 peptide mimetic inhibitors that consists of 39 amino acids. PRO 542 is a soluble CD4 receptor (CD4-IgG2) that binds to and neutralizes gp120 before virus binding occurs. SCH-C is an oxime-piperidine compound that is a coreceptor antagonist. This small molecule acts as an inhibitor of CCR5. MD3100 is a non-peptidic, low molecular weight bicyclam compound that prevents interactions between CXCR4 and gp120, blocking signal transduction from CXCR4. Future research in this field will provide us with additional antiviral compounds to add to the anti-HIV armory.",
