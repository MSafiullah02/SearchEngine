Nanotechnology deals with the manufacturing and applications of materials with nanoscale diameter. Nanoparticles (NPs) have shown distinctive properties, which can be rightfully manipulated for several preferred applications due to their high surface area to volume ratio and vast electronic, optical, magnetic, chemical, and physical properties. Significant interest has arisen in the research of NPs during the last decade. Nanoparticles due to their controlled size and composition got fundamental and technological attention because they offer solutions to technological and environmental challenges, owe to their wide applications in various fields, such as in pharmaceutical and biomedical, biomedicine, catalysis, water treatment, energy conservation with tunable electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, tensile strength, superior rigidity, hardness and erosion resistance, which are currently used for manufacturing of satellite components, aircraft spares, industry parts, and electronic microchips [1, 2] . However, in most studies they are suggested to be nontoxic, but due to their small size and variable properties, they are suggested to be perilous to the environment to a significant extent [3] . The present chapter highlights the various synthetic schemes and diversified applications of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs).",

To understand these processes in a lucid manner, the Brick Concept may be taken. Breaking a wall down into its components, the bricks refer to the top-down approach, whereas fabrication of the brick from initial ingredients like clay-bearing soil, sand, lime, and water would represent bottom-up approach (Figs. 1and 2) . Consequently, in a systematic way of nanoscience, the top-down approach involves the use of bulky materials and reduces them into nanoparticles via physical/chemical/mechanical processes. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach requires begins from molecules or atoms to obtain nanoparticles [3] . Some most frequently used methods for the synthesis of AgNPs are discussed herein (Fig. 2) . Vapor condensation process involves two steps, evaporation and condensation, which are carried out using a tube furnace at atmospheric pressure. The source material within a boat centered at the furnace is vaporized into a carrier gas. Nanoparticles of various materials, such as Ag, Au, PbS, can be prepared by this method. In order to synthesize AgNPs, the vaporization method has been frequently used, in which the target materials are vaporized by the heat source and then rapidly condensed resulting in the synthesized nanoparticles.",

            "text": "To synthesize silver nanoparticles by chemical reduction is the most frequently applied method for the preparation of stable, colloidal dispersions in water or other suitable organic solvents. In general, the chemical reduction process of AgNPs in the solution includes the following three main components: (i) metal precursors, (ii) reducing agents, and (iii) stabilizing/capping agents. The overall phenomenon involves coprecipitation in which the concurrence of different substeps such as reduction, nucleation, growth, coarsening, and agglomeration observed. In this strategy, the size is controlled by arrested precipitation technique. The basic trick has been to synthesize and study the nanomaterial in situ, that is, in the same liquid/ medium avoiding the physical changes and aggregation of tiny crystallites or particles. At this stage, a capping agent is introduced to the parent solution before precipitation reaction to maintain separation between the particles formed. As prepared, nanoparticles are separated by centrifugation, washed and vacuum dried. The dried material was further subjected to UV curing for the possible polymerization of surfactant capping film on the surface of nanocluster for imparting true quantum confinement [5] . There are several typical reducing agents include NaBH 4 , N 2 H 4 , polyols, tri-sodium citrate (TSC), sodium citrate, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). In order to prevent aggregation between AgNPs, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and some polymeric systems like polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polymethacrylic acid, and polymethylmethacrylate have been reported to be the effective protective agents to stabilize as capping agents for stabilization. Some of the chemical reducing reactions can be carried out at ambient temperature, while most of them need elevated temperatures for increasing reaction rate.",

AgNPs show much variation in shape ranging from spherical to trigonal/hexagonal. Ascorbic acid as a reducing agent favors the formation of flower-like silver nano architecture at room temperature with average particle size of 20 nm. Moreover, AgNPs have been synthesized by the polyol process with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide from nitrate salt of silver as the base material, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as the stabilizer for the silver clusters, and ethylene glycol as the reducing agent and solvent. PVP not only protected the nano-sized silver particles from aggregation, but it also promoted nucleation phenomenon [6, 7] . Moreover, for the preparation of monodispersed and uniform sized ANPs, the simultaneous formation of nuclei for subsequent growth is required. The initial nucleation and the subsequent growth of nuclei can be controlled by adjusting the reaction parameters such as temperature, pH, precursor types, solvents, reduction agents, and stabilizing/capping agents.",

Reduction of Ag + to Ag 0 was achieved successfully using UV light instead of chemical materials in a natural rubber matrix via photo reduction of the film cast from natural rubber latex (NRL) containing silver salt, with an average size ranged 10 nm. Synthesis procedures using microwave irradiation have also been employed, and this method is known to have a faster heating rate than conventional heating through conduction and convection. Their size and the time needed for their preparation are directly proportional to the irradiation power of the light source. For example, with a low-power lamp (4 W), irradiation for 9 h is needed to produce 19 nm diameter AgNPs, while with a stronger source (150 W), the reaction takes only 45 min. However, in the latter case, the AgNPs are polydisperse and smaller than when they are prepared using a lowerenergy lamp [11] .",

Their potent antibacterial activity was reported against various strains of bacteria including highly pathogenic bacteria species including gram positive and gram negative bacteria. It was observed that a small amount of AgNPs is deadly for the majority of viruses and bacteria [20] . Sondi and Salopeck-Sondi reported the antibacterial activities of AgNPs against E. coli (representative species for gram negative bacteria) on Luria-Bertani agar plates [21] .

Along with the antibacterial activities of the AgNPs, numerous studies had been reported on the antifungal efficacy of AgNPs, which reveal that AgNPs could be used as an effective antifungal agent because AgNPs exhibit excellent antifungal characteristics against a number of fungal species. In a study, Kim et al. reported the antifungal activities of the AgNPs against different fungal strains such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida albicans fungi and observed that AgNPs exhibited good antifungal activity [24] . Later, the antifungal activity of the silver nanoparticles fabricated by the modified Tollens process was evaluated for common pathogenic Candida sp. by in terms of the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), and the time-dependency of yeasts growth inhibition reported by Panacek et al.

AgNPs are famous for their antimicrobial activities; therefore researchers have diverted their attention and started evaluating the importance of AgNPs in controlling infectious diseases caused by pathogens and viruses. Nevertheless, the number of reported works using AgNPs for controlling viral infections is very low but still, it can pave the way for other researchers to show their interest in dealing with viral infections using AgNPs nanoparticle. In this regard, Elechiguerra et al. reported the effect of AgNPs on the HIV-1 virus.

Several studies have been previously performed in water filtration applications to this context, generally to prevent bacterial fouling of membrane filters [29] [30] [31] . Additionally, Dankovich and Gray investigated bactericidal paper impregnated with silver nanoparticles for point-of-use water treatment [32] . In this study, silver-nanoparticle-containing papers were tested with respect to bacteria inactivation and silver leaching as suspensions of bacteria percolated through the paper. Therefore, AgNP sheets exhibited antibacterial properties toward suspensions of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, with log reduction values in the effluent of over log 6 and log 3, respectively. The silver loss from the AgNP sheets was minimal under current US EPA and WHO limit (0.1 ppm) for silver in drinking water. Thus, the percolation of bacterially contaminated water through paper embedded with silver nanoparticles could be an effective water treatment process in the near future.",

The main focus is to develop well-defined catalysts, which may include both metal nanoparticles and a nanomaterial as support. These nanocatalysts should be able to display the ensuing benefits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, namely high efficiency and selectivity, stability and easy recovery/recycling [35] . Recently, it has been demonstrated experimentally that metallic nanoparticles have high catalytic characteristics for several chemical reactions such as hydrogenation, hydroformylation, and carbonylation. Nevertheless, in most cases, AgNPs would congregate during catalytic processes, because nanosized metal particles in the solution are active and prone to coalesce due to weak van der Waals forces and high surface energy unless they are protected. In this regard, surface modification using polymers, complex ligands, or surfactants is frequently used to stabilize metal catalysts [36] . Bastus et al. reported the highly monodisperse sodium citrate-coated spherical AgNPs with controlled sizes ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm have been synthesized by following a kinetically controlled seeded-growth approach via the reduction of silver nitrate by sodium citrate and tannic acid as chemical reducing agents. They found that as prepared AgNPs exhibited excellent reduction power with respect to the reduction of Rhodamine B by sodium borohydride as a model reaction system [37] . Recent progress in synthetic chemistry AgNPs found a great interest because of their unique reactivity and selectivity, stability, as well as recyclability in catalytic reactions. In particular, a number of reactions can be catalyzed by AgNPs. Additionally, the strong potential of AgNPs in catalysis in the total synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules is highly under consideration currently. AgNPs catalyzed reactions widely utilized in various industrial applications including analgesic and antipyretic drugs, photographic develops, and corrosion inhibitors [38] .",
