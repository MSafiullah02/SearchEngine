Instead, for a careful trade-off between potential risk of hospital infection and performance of lifesaving procedures, the selection of indications for emergency endoscopy cannot be overemphasized; necessary endoscopic procedures should be performed with patients and healthcare providers all well protected. Preventing COVID-19 transmission in endoscopy units is an important problem that faces many gastroenterology departments.",
