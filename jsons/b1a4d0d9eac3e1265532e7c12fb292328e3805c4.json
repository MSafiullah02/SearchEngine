Section 5 focuses on a deeper analysis on the origins of COVID-19. Section 6 focuses on the analysis of the terminology related to the latest research. Finally Section 7 concludes this paper. Some related work reports either studies on various topics or focuses on one or two topics. For example, the report from Nature Medecine 6 presents a focus on clinical trials and human studies, Preclinical studies, and Epidemiology. Another distinction on related work is what level as automatic assistance they benefit from. In most of the cases, it is difficult to know that level as it is not necessarily depicted. For example, 6 seems to be a manual analysis of a few papers on the topic since the references are few. Harapan et al. 11 presents a literature review on Coronavirus disease 2019 . This study cites 74 references and presents a comprehensive state of the art on different sub-topics such as COVID-19 transmission, risk factors, diagnosis or treatments. Huang et al. 15 reviewed 1,281 abstracts from which they identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of interest for their study. The five topics they chose are as follows: antibody kinetics, correlates of protection, immunopathogenesis, antigenic diversity and crossreactivity, and population seroprevalence. Dousset et al. 8 presents a short analysis of a larger dataset which size is similar to the one that we are using in this study. However their study does not go in deep in the publication content but rather analyze the collaborations between researchers and countries. They do not analyze any specific topic.",

In this figure, the only blue node is BAT-ORIGIN term, while the red nodes are authors of publications that mention this term. The value on the link indicates the number of publications a researcher authored that mention BAT-ORIGIN.

We then built a graph where nodes ( keyphrases) are linked when cooccuring in a publication. This is a weighted graph (the more the two keyphrases co-occur, the higher the weight).

As we did in Section 5 and illustrated in Figure 1 (c), we look at the publications associated with these terms. We found 33 publications directly related to these terms. The PMID of these publications as well as related terms are presented in Figure 5 . From this Figure 5 , we can see that some of the papers are more connected than others; suggesting they potentially mention more topics of interest. For example, PMID 32277367 23 , which is marked up with a black square on the right-bottom part of Figure 5 , was published on the 10th of April, in J Neurooncol. and results from a collaborative work of India, Russia, and UK and concludes that \"it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice\". This paper also mentions various evidence that suggest potential benefits of various drugs. Reversely, we can see in the same figure that some keywords are also more shared than others.
