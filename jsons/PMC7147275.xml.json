Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain (RBD) of this new CoV resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that they might use the same receptor. These findings highlight the urgent need for regular surveillance of the interspecies transmission of bat-origin CoV to human populations.",

Phylogenetic analysis showed that this virus forms a single clade. Collectively, these data indicate that this CoV should be considered a new species. The outbreak of SARS in 2003 largely boosted awareness of threats caused by emerging CoVs. Consequently, great efforts have been made to monitor novel emerging CoVs and to trace their origins so as to establish a risk assessment and alert system for preventing potential epidemics in the human population. Clarification of the coronavirome in animals, particularly in bats as a key reservoir of a wide range of CoVs, should be a priority for any task force.[23,24]",
