In this view, the uncertainty adds to an individual's sense of unease, leading to loss of hope and initiative. People who have active symptoms of the disease hesitate to disclose or seek help as they anticipate stigma from the society (Logie & Turan, 2020) . Fear and unawareness about health promoting strategies can lead to uncooperativeness towards health workers and governmental instructions. Psychologists should provide awareness about the different stress reactions and provide them with authentic and relevant J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f information about the pandemic. The fear of contracting the pandemic could be more destructive than the virus itself. Therefore, even the uninfected population must be educated about propagation of fake news and should be provided with hope and optimism intervention.",
