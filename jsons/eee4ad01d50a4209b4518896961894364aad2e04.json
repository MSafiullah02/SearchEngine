Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social-distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, and contact-tracing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of an anti-COVID-19 vaccine is necessary to build the community herd immunity needed to effectively control and eliminate the pandemic. This study is based on the design and use of a mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19. An analytical expression for the minimum number of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with mortality",

            "text": "It should be emphasized that the epidemiological compartment I a also contain individuals who may show mild symptoms of the disease. Furthermore, the compartment I h for hospitalization also includes those with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 who are self-isolating at home. The model is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations (where a dot represents differentiation with respect to time t): A flow diagram of the model is depicted in Figure 1 . The state variables and parameters of the model are described in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. In the model (2.1), the parameter \u03b2 s (\u03b2 a ) represents the effective contact rate (i.e., contacts capable of leading to COVID-19 transmission) for symptomatically-infectious (asymptomaticallyinfectious) individuals, 0 < c M \u2264 1 is the proportion of members of the public who wear face-masks (correctly and consistently) in public and 0 < M \u2264 1 is the efficacy of the face-masks. This formulation (i.e., \u03b2 s = \u03b2 a ) allows us to account for the possible heterogeneity in the contact rates of infectious with (I s ) or without (I a ) clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Unvaccinated susceptible individuals are vaccinated at a per capita rate \u03be v . It is assumed that the hypothetical anti-COVID-19 vaccine is imperfect (i.e., it allows for breakthrough infected in vaccinated susceptible individuals who became infected with COVID- 19) , with a protective efficacy 0 < \u03b5 v \u2264 1 against COVID-19. The parameter \u03c3 represents the progression rate of exposed individuals (i.e., 1/\u03c3 is the intrinsic incubation period of . A proportion, 0 < r \u2264 1, of exposed individuals show no clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (and move to the class I a ) at the end of the incubation period. The remaining proportion, 1 \u2212 r, show clinical symptoms and move to the I s class. The parameter \u03b3 s (\u03b3 a )(\u03b3 h ) represents the recovery rate for individuals in the I s (I a )(I h ) class. Similarly, \u03c6 s is the hospitalization (or self-isolation) rate of individuals with clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Finally, the parameter \u03b4 s (\u03b4 h ) represents the COVID-induced mortality rate for individuals in the I s (I h ) class. It should be mentioned that, since not much data is available on the expected properties of a future anti-COVID-19 vaccine, we do not assume that the vaccine offers any therapeutic benefits. Further, we do not assume that the vaccine wanes during the one-year time period we would choose for the numerical simulations of our model. The model (2.1) is an extension of numerous deterministic models for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic, such as those in [4, 11] , by explicitly incorporating an imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic model for COVID-19 transmission that explicitly incorporates an imperfect vaccine. This article is a US Government work.

For instance, while Figure 3 shows that up to 120,000 cumulative mortality can be recorded in the US if social-distancing measures were not implemented, the cumulative mortality dramatically decreases to about 64,000 (representing about 47% reduction in cumulative mortality) if strict social-distancing measures were implemented (Figure 3 (b)).

The question then is what is the minimum proportion of those we can vaccinate that we need to vaccinate so that those that we cannot vaccinate can be protected from developing severe disease or dying of the disease. The notion of herd immunity in the transmission dynamics is associated with the indirect protection, against acquisition of a communicable disease, members of the community receive when a large percentage of the population has become immune to the infectious disease due to natural recovery from prior infection or vaccination [30, 31] . The consequence of herd immunity is that individuals who are not immune (e.g., those who cannot be vaccinated or those who have not been infected yet) receive some protection against the acquisition of the disease. The safest and fastest way to achieve herd immunity is obviously vaccination. It should, however, be mentioned that Sweden employed the other mechanism for achieving herd immunity in the context of COVID-19 dynamics in Sweden [32] . In other words, the Swedish public health agencies aimed to build herd immunity by not implementing the basic community transmission reduction strategies (e.g., social-distancing, community lockdowns, use of face masks in public, contact tracing etc.) implemented in almost every country or community that is hard-hit with the COVID-19 pandemic, opting, instead, to allow individuals to acquire infection and, hopefully, recover from it. Although some level of this natural herd immunity has been achieved in Sweden, the COVID-induced mortality recorded in Sweden far exceed those recorded for neighbouring Scandinavian countries that implemented the aforementioned non-pharmaceutical interventions [32] .",

In order to compute the community herd immunity thresholds for the US, New York state and Florida state, we compute the respective values of R 0 , using (3.8) with the baseline values of the community contact rates parameters, \u03b2 a and \u03b2 s , reduced by 30% (to account for the effect of the implementation of effective social-distancing measures [4] ). That is, we set \u03b2 a = 0.8400, \u03b2 s = 0.4971 for US, \u03b2 a = 0.5648, \u03b2 s = 0.3871 for New York state and \u03b2 a = 0.7675, \u03b2 s = 0.4621 for the state of Florida in Equation (3.8) to obtain the values of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for the US, New York state and the state of Florida. This gives R 0 = 3.58, 3.04 and 3.12, respectively. Substituting these values of R 0 (for each of the three populations) in Equation (3.7), and noting that the vaccine efficacy is assumed to be 80% (i.e., \u03b5 v = 0.8), shows that the respective vaccine-derived community herd immunity thresholds for the entire US, the state of New York and the state of Florida are 90%, 84% and 85%, respectively (as tabulated in Table 4 ). The epidemiological implication of these analyses is that the pandemic can be effectively controlled and/or eliminated in the US and the states of New York and Florida if at least 90%, 84% and 85% of the respective unvaccinated susceptible populations are vaccinated (using the hypothetical imperfect vaccine with the assumed protective efficacy of 80%). It should be mentioned that these vaccine-derived community herd immunity percentages significantly decrease if the vaccination program is complemented with a public face mask use strategy. In particular, Table 4 shows that the herd immunity threshold for the US reduced to about 78% if half the US population wears mask in public . Face mask usage with compliance of 30% to 50% decreases the herd immunity thresholds for the states of New York and Florida to between 70% to 78%. These are reasonably attainable in the two states. Thus, these simulations show that combining a vaccination program (using the hypothetical anti-COVID-19 vaccine with assumed efficacy of 80%) with a public mask use strategy significantly enhances the prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the states of New York and Florida, and the in entire US nation (albeit elimination is easier to achieve in either of the two states than in the entire US nation).

It is evident from Figure 5 that a 10-fold increase in the baseline value of the vaccination rate (\u03be v ) for the states of New York (Figures 5 (c) and (d)) and Florida (Figures 5 (e) and (f)) will bring the respective daily deaths at the peak and the projected cumulative mortality to very low levels (i.e., low levels that essentially imply the effective control or elimination of the pandemic). Thus, these simulations suggest that, while a significantly large increase in vaccination rate (from baseline) is necessarily needed to eliminate COVID-19 from the entire US, only a small increase (as low as 10%) in the baseline vaccination rate will be needed to eliminate COVID-19 in the states of New York and Florida. These simulations further show that the prospect of disease elimination using the vaccine (with the assumed protective efficacy of 80%) is more promising in the states of New York and Florida than nationwide (where much larger vaccination coverage will be needed to bring, and maintain, the control reproduction number, R c , to a value less than unity).",

Specifically, a contour plot of the control reproduction number (R c ) of the model, as a function of coverage (f v ) and vaccine efficacy (\u03b5 v ), is depicted in Figure 6 . This figure shows a decrease in the value of the reproduction number with increasing coverage and efficacy of the vaccine, as expected. For the assumed 80% efficacy of the hypothetical vaccine (i.e., \u03b5 v = 0.8) in Table 3 (a), the simulations depicted in Figure  6 (a) show that nationwide elimination of COVID-19 can be achieved (i.e., R c can be brought to a value below unity) if at least 90% of the US populace is vaccinated.

The results obtained, depicted in Figure 7 , show that COVID-19 elimination (measured in terms of bringing R c to a value less than unity) is feasible even if social-distancing is implemented at a low level of effectiveness (left panels of Figure 7 ). In particular, Figure 7 (a) shows that, with the assumed 80% efficacy of the vaccine, the implementation of social-distancing at low effectiveness level will lead to the elimination of COVID-19 in the US if the nationwide vaccination coverage is at least 88%. This vaccination coverage needed to achieve such elimination decreases with increasing effectiveness of the social-distancing measures (Figures 7 (b) and (c) ). For the state of New York, for instance, vaccination program combined with social-distancing at low effectiveness level will lead to COVID-19 elimination if at least 80% of the residents of the state are vaccinated (Figure 7 (b) ). The vaccination coverage needed for elimination decrease to 67% and 61%, respectively, if the social-distancing measures are implemented at moderate (Figure 7 (e)) and high ( Figure  7 (f)) effectiveness levels. Finally, for the state of Florida, combining vaccination with social-distancing at low effectiveness level will lead to COVID-19 elimination in the state if at least 80% of the residents of the state are vaccinated (Figure 7 (g) ). The coverage needed for COVID-19 elimination in Florida decrease to 70% and 47%, respectively, for moderate (Figure 7 (h)) and high (Figure 7 (i)) effectiveness levels of the social-distancing strategy. Additional numerical simulations were carried out to assess the community-wide impact of the combined impact of vaccination with a public mask use strategy (as measured in terms of reduction in the value of control reproduction number, R c ). The results obtained, depicted in Figure 8 , show a decrease in R c with increasing vaccine efficacy and compliance. For the fixed vaccine efficacy at 80%, the minimum vaccine coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 in the entire US if public mask use compliance is fixed at 10%, 30% and 50% is 90%, 86% and 82%, respectively (Figures 8 (a), (b) and (c)). Similarly, COVID-19 elimination can occur in the state of New York if the corresponding vaccine coverage are 82%, 80% and 71%, respectively (Figures 8 (d) , (e) and (f)). The numbers corresponding to elimination in the state of Florida are 86%, 80% and 73%, respectively (Figures 8 (g) , (h) and (i)).",

Although there are currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans, numerous concerted global efforts are underway aimed at developing such vaccine. In fact, a number of candidate vaccines are undergoing advanced stages of clinical trials. One of the most promising of these efforts is the candidate vaccine being developed by a research group at Oxford University, which is expected to be available as early as January 2021 (or, latest, by the spring of 2021). We developed a mathematical model for assessing the the potential community-wide impact of a hypothetical imperfect vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. The model we developed, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, was parametrized using COVID-19 data for the entire US, as well as for the US states of New York and Florida.

The epidemiological implication of this result is that the COVID-19 pandemic can be effectively controlled, whenever R c < 1, if the initial sizes of the sub-populations of the model are small enough. In other words, for this setting, the routine vaccination against COVID-19 in the US can lead to the effective control of the pandemic if the efficacy and nationwide coverage of the hypothetical vaccine are high enough.

We computed these thresholds for the case where social (physical)distancing is also implemented, and that the social-distancing is implemented at an effectiveness level that reduces the baseline values of the community contact rate parameters (\u03b2 a and \u03b2 s ) by 30%. Our computations show, using the baseline values of the parameters of the model, that at least 90% of the entire US population needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve nationwide vaccine-derived herd immunity. Similarly, at least 84% and 85% of the total susceptible population in the states of New York and Florida, respectively, need to be vaccinated to achieve such herd immunity in the states. These vaccine coverage numbers are certainly on the high side, and may not be easily attained for so many reasons (ranging from the expected insufficient stockpile of the vaccine during the early stages of their deployment, general apathy towards vaccination and the sizable percentage of people that cannot be vaccinated for medical, personal and other reasons). Our simulations showed that if the vaccination strategy is complemented with other public health interventions, such as a public mask use strategy for instance, the minimum herd immunity threshold required to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduces to a more realistically-attainable level. For example, if vaccination (using a vaccine with the assumed efficacy of 80%) is combined with a public face mask strategy with 30% mask compliance nationwide, the herd immunity threshold for the entire US decreases from the 90% (for the mask-free scenario described above) to 78%. Thus, the prospect of the effective control of COVID-19 using routine vaccination is enhanced if it is combined with a public mass use strategy (especially if the effectiveness and coverage of the mask use strategy are high enough).",

The results obtained showed that the COVID-19 burden (as measured in terms of daily and cumulative COVID-induced mortality) decreases with increasing vaccination rate, as expected. Our simulations showed that, while significantly high increases in the vaccination rate (from its baseline value) was necessarily needed to achieve significant reduction in disease burden in the entire US, a relatively small increase in the vaccination rate from its baseline value (as low as 10% increase) will be sufficient to lead to the effective control (or even elimination) of COVID-19 pandemic in the states of New York and Florida. In other words, the prospects of eliminating COVID-19, using the hypothetical vaccine, are more promising in the states of New York and Florida, than nationwide (owing to the unrealistically high vaccine coverage needed to curtail or eliminate the pandemic in the latter).",

It was shown that, for the case of the entire US, if the vaccine efficacy is fixed at the assumed 80% and mask compliance is fixed at the low value of 10%, COVID-19 can be eliminated in the US if the vaccine coverage is at least 90%. The vaccine coverage decreases to 86% and 82%, respectively, if mask use compliance is increased to 30% and 50% nationwide (the numbers for US state of New York, corresponding to the aforementioned mask use coverage are 82%, 80% and 71%, respectively; similarly, the numbers for the US state of Florida are 86%, 80% and 73%, respectively).
