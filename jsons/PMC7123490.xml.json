            "text": "\nCathepsins are synthesized as preproenzymes, whereby the signal peptide targets for entry of the nascent chains into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). The signal peptide (pre) is co-translationally cleaved off by signal peptidase upon entry into the ER lumen. The propeptides (pro) keep procathepsins in the zymogen form, that is, proteolytically inactive during their transport from the rER via the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to late endosomes (Fig. 10.1) (Brix et al. 2008, 2015; Erickson et al. 2013). Procathepsins need to pass the quality control of the rER before they become posttranslationally modified while traveling to the TGN. Interestingly, proper folding of cathepsins can be conveyed by their propeptides as some of these bear chaperone functions. The most important and best-studied posttranslational modification of cathepsins is mannose 6-phosphorylation. It is believed to occur in the cis-Golgi and to be required for recognition by cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CD-MPR) of the TGN, which sort the zymogens into clathrin-coated transport vesicles (Fig. 10.1) (De Duve and Wattiaux 1966; Kornfeld and Mellman 1989; von Figura 1991; Kornfeld 1992; Erickson et al. 2013; Brix et al. 2015). Upon arrival in late endosomes, the pH drops such that procathepsins dissociate from the sorting CD-MPR, which is recycled back to the TGN via retromer-coated vesicles. In late endosomes, procathepsins are proteolytically processed to acquire the mature and proteolytically active state (Fig. 10.1). Therefore, either asparaginyl endo peptidase (AEP), which is better known as legumain, or cathepsins themselves cleave procathepsins in trans such that the propeptides are removed and the mature forms are delivered for further functioning as soluble enzymes in the compartments of the endocytic pathway. Thus, proteolytic processing for maturation and activation of procathepsins takes place in the late endosome.\n",

However, the mature, single-chain form of cathepsin B, in particular, can be processed further, thereby yielding a two-chain form that consists of a light and a heavy chain, which remain bound to each other by disulfide bonds (Mort and Buttle 1997). Both, single- and two-chain forms of cathepsin B are proteolytically active as hydrolases. The molecular architecture of procathepsin-activating AEP/legumain differs from that of cathepsins, in that the peptidase domain directly follows the signal peptide and the pro-domain is found at the C-terminus (Table 10.2). Legumain is further exceptional, because it acts not only as a peptidase but features also peptide lig ase activity depending on the conditions it is exposed to (Dall and Brandstetter 2016).\n\n\n",

            "text": "Cathepsins belong to either of three classes of proteolytic enzymes, namely, aspartic, cysteine, or serine proteases (Rawlings 2013; Rawlings et al. 2016). Hence, cathepsins are classified according to the amino acids\nof their active sites that are responsible for catalytic hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Aspartic acid or cysteine residues are part of the catalytic dyad of the aspartic and cysteine cathepsins, respectively, while serine is part of a catalytic triad in which an additional residue is required to stabilize the oxyanion hole in the acyl intermediate upon interaction between the enzyme and its substrate. Aspartic cathepsins are acting as water nucleophiles, whereas cysteine and serine cathepsins act as protein nucleophiles (Baici et al. 2013). Hence, the nucleophile is provided by a side chain of an amino acid in the active site, namely, the sulfhydryl or the hydroxyl group of either cysteine or serine, respectively, in cysteine and serine cathepsins. For example, serine bears the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of serine cathepsins, while histidine acts as the general base. In addition, aspartate helps to orient the imidazolium ring of histidine such that it activates serine to perform the nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate, whereby a temporary complex between the enzyme and its substrate forms, i.e., the acyl intermediate. This breaks down rapidly, resulting in protonation of the general base histidine. Subsequent hydrolysis of the scissile bond occurs when a water molecule enters. The reaction mechanism of peptide bond hydrolysis catalyzed by cathepsins therefore involves two substrates, the protein or peptide substrate and a water molecule, and two products are generated, na\nmely, an N- and a C-terminal peptide product.",

            "text": "Cathepsin activities are counterbalanced by endogenous inhibitors (Tables 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3). The aspartic cathepsins D an d E, which are mostly detected in lysosomes, are inhibited by pepstatin (Dean 1979) or by a natural product isolated from the sea anemone Actinia equina, equistatin. This latter inhibitor interestingly also interacts with cysteine peptidases (Lenarcic et al. 1997; Lenarcic and Turk 1999) including the cysteine cathepsins that are found preferentially in endo-lysosomes but also frequently in extra- and pericellular locations. Furthermore, aberrant or alternative forms of cysteine cathepsins are detected in the cytosol, as well as the nuclear and mitochondrial matrices (Brix et al. 2015). Cytosolic cystatins A and B, also known as stefins A and B (Machleidt et al. 1983; Brzin et al. 1983), as well as secreted cystatins C, D, E/M, F, and SN (Barrett 1986; Sloane et al. 1990; Turk and Bode 1991; Alvarez-Fernandez et al. 1999; Abrahamson et al. 2003; Turk et al. 2008; Zeeuwen et al. 2009) serve as endogenous inhibitors of the cysteine cathepsins. In addition, alpha-2-macroglobulin has been identified as an inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins (Fritz 1979; Travis 1988). Cysteine catheps ins, in principle, can also be inhibited by serpins, which are cross-class inhibitors of serine proteases (Silverman et al. 2001). Like the cystatins, serpins are present intra- and extracellularly. Serpins have a reactive center loop that serves as a bait for the attacking serine protease and, upon cleavage, remains bound by covalent linkage to the enzyme (Huntington 2006; Whisstock et al. 2010).",

ABPs consist of a reactive functional group (so-called warhead) that binds to the target protease, a linker region that resembles a peptide substrate, and additional tagging groups. The tagging groups are typically fluorogenic, but biotin or iodinatable moieties have also been chemically engineered onto ABPs. Hence, a family or subfamilies of cathepsins are functionally addressed and become covalently tagged upon cleavage of the ABP\u2019s linker. ABPs are available as broad-spectrum probes used in approaching the proteolytic activities of aspartic, cysteine, and serine cathepsins. In addition, specific ABPs have been synthesized that can be cleaved by one or only few cathepsins. Moreover, ABPs with propeptide-mimicking features in the peptide backbone have been used (Schaschke et al. 1998; Diederich et al. 2012). Such highly specific ABPs are, in principle, able to distinguish even closely related cathepsins.",

This is to say that most ABPs act as inhibitors that are attacked and cleaved in a substrate-like fashion, but remain bound to the targeted enzyme, thus forming an irreversible, covalent complex with the target protease. The concept of ABP labeling of cathepsins can be compared with the suicidal inhibition mechanism of the serpins on their target proteases (see above). The principle of specific and irreversible binding bears the advantage of rendering ABPs into quantitative probes that allow to detect only mature, proteolytically active cathepsins. However, the disadvantage of many ABPs is equally intrinsic, namely, they act as protease inhibitors and may eventually lead to pharmacological knockdown of proteolytic activities when applied to living cells.",

Such experiments have helped to uncover the transport pathways that are followed by pro- and mature cathepsins in different eukaryotic cells. Importantly, it is now state of the art to distinguish proteolytically active from inactive cathepsins. Moreover, it became clear that each and every cell type may use cathepsins strategically in its own, distinct way in support of the specific cell\u2019s function (Brix et al. 2008, 2015; Mohamed and Sloane 2006; Sloane et al. 2013; Weiss-Sadan et al. 2017). Hence, subcellular locations of cathepsin activities have been detected that encompass the expected canonical endo-lysosomal compartments. However, quite often locations of cathepsin activities were detected which were, by all means, unexpected. Thus, cathepsins exhibit an astonishing variety of transport pathways to reach numerous intra- and extracellular locations where the proteases may function in a spatially confined and temporally regulated manner (Mohamed and Sloane 2006; Gocheva and Joyce 2007; Brix et al. 2013, 2015; Akkari et al. 2016).",

Yet another pathway is used in particular in cells of the innate immune system, like macrophages, that express the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR, also referred to as IGFII/M6PR) (Mason et al. 1987; Pohlmann et al. 1995; Collette et al. 2004).

Moreover, this protein serves as a regulator of a number of proteases, namely, it is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and cysteine cathepsins alike. Other receptors known to interact with secreted cathepsins are those of the diverse low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-like protein (LRP) family of transmembrane proteins present at the cell surface of almost all cell types (Poller et al. 1995; Willnow et al. 1996; Herz and Strickland 2001). Megalin/gp330 is one of the LRPs that is supposed to mediate internalization and endo-lysosomal delivery of cathepsins, if previously secreted by mistake (Nielsen et al. 2007). Thus, LRPs function in a way similar to the CI-MPR but interact also with pro- and mature cathepsins lacking mannose 6-phosphorylation (Fig. 10.1, right transport route).",

            "text": "Depending on the extracellular conditions, cathepsins may acquire altered or additional substrate preferences. For example, the cysteine cathepsin K is secreted under physiological conditions as an active enzyme and acts in the acidic resorption lacuna formed by osteoclasts during bone turnover (Gelb et al. 1996; Saftig et al. 1998; Rachner et al. 2011; Fonovi\u0107 and Turk 2014; Br\u00f6mme et al. 2016). However, cathepsin K is also responsible for degradation of thyroglobulin in the extracellular thyroid follicle lumen, namely, at neutral pH and in oxidizing conditions (Tepel et al. 2000; Friedrichs et al. 2003; Jordans et al. 2009). Moreover, secreted cathepsin K monomers can interact with each other, thereby forming polymeric ringlike structures, depending on the molecular composition of the extracellular space (Li et al. 2002). It has been shown that ECM components like glycosaminoglycans and other constituents are essential as scaffolding factors supporting extracellular interactions of cathepsin K molecules (Li et al. 2004). Moreover, cathepsin K can be stabilized extracellularly by binding to cell surface molecules like clusterin (Novinec et al. 2012), which also interacts with protease receptors of the LRP family, e.g., megalin/gp330 (Lemansky et al. 1999). Importantly, the activity of this particular enzyme\u2014cysteine cathepsin K\u2014differs in monomeric and dimeric as well as in soluble and ECM- or membrane-bound form (Aguda et al. 2014). Hence, different substrates can be cleaved by the same cathepsin, and a given substrate can be processed differently by that enzyme, depending on whether the cathepsin is secreted as an active monomer or dimer, scaffolded by ECM constituents, or bound by cell surface receptors complexed with allosteric cofactors. It is important to note that cysteine cathepsin K is well-studied, in particu lar, because of its significance as an anti-osteoporotic drug target.",

Mature cathepsins may then be released into the cytosol, where proteolytic activity is controlled by different means, such as endogenous inhibitors that specifically bind to the enzymes or other biochemical properties of the cytosol that are not optimal for cathepsin-mediated cleavage. However, when escaping these safeguarding measures by, for instance, inhibitor downregulation, proteolytically active cathepsins may be present in the cytosol for prolonged time intervals and induce apoptotic, necrotic, or pyroptotic cascades resulting in cell death (Turk et al. 2000; Luke et al. 2007; Turk and Turk 2009; Aits and J\u00e4\u00e4ttel\u00e4 2013; Fl\u00fctsch and Gr\u00fctter 2013).

The mechanism by which they are transported through the nuclear pore complexes is not known, because most endo-lysosomal enzymes (except AEP/legumain) lack a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). It is reasonable to assume, however, that such nuclear cathepsins, as well as the cytosolic forms, are involved in processing of transcription factors, core, and/or linker histones. In vitro experiments further revealed an important role of DNA as a potential scaffolding factor that interferes with serpin-mediated control of cathepsin activities in environments that mimic unexpected cellular locations like the nuclear matrix (Ong et al. 2007).",

Endosomal cysteine cathepsins B and L are also involved in the processing of the envelope glycoproteins of Marburg and Ebola viruses. Cathepsin cleavage enables the glycoprotein to interact with the Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NDC-1) protein of the host cell, which is an essential step in filovirus entry (Hunt et al. 2012). Likewise, endosomal cathepsins are utilized by non-enveloped reoviruses for host cell entry.

Similarly, virus transformation of cultured cells in vitro is known to cause upregulation and secretion of the so-called major excreted protein (MEP), which was found in the secretion media of transformed fibroblasts and identified as proteolytically active cathepsin L (Mason et al. 1987; Rubin 2005). Thus, viruses may not only affect transcriptional regulation of cathepsin genes but may thereby also cause mis-trafficking of the proteases. In hepatocellular carcinoma, caused by infection with hepatitis B and C viruses, altered cathepsin trafficking also results in their secretion. In this particular case of virus-induced liver cancer, the over-secretion of cathepsins is further complicated by the defective functioning of the IGFII/M6P receptor (CI-MPR) pathway, normally acting as a recapture mechanism for internalization of faulty and excessively secreted cathepsins (see above) (Scharf and Braulke 2003). Thus, in the absence of re-internalization cues, the cathepsins may be present in enhanced amounts at the cell surface of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",

            "text": "Finally, a chapter on cathepsins in a book on viruses cannot end without placing a special note in the context of therapeutic approaches aiming at eliminating viruses from the host. In particular, the retroviral HIV protease is important for maturation of the virus particles and, hence, targeted therapeutically (Moyle and Gazzard 1996; Cooper 2002). HIV proteinase structurally resembles the ubiquitously expressed aspartic cathepsin D, denoting the similarities between host cell\u2019s aspartic cathepsins and retroviral aspartic proteases, which are\u2014in the case of HIV\u2014successfully inhibited when approached by transition-state inhibitors. Therefore, and in conclusion, basic science researchers, virologists, and clinicians have learned a lot from the structural similarities of host cell cathepsins and viral proteases. We deduce that interactions between cell biologists and virologists bear more interesting facts to be gathered in the future. Moreover, many more potential therapeutic answers are to be developed from the encounters of cathepsins and the various viruses utilizing the proteases in their own favor. Hence, some of the comments in this chapter are meant in support of stimulating future discussions in the spirit of thinking \u201cout of the box,\u201d and, like the cathepsins, following paths beyond the canonical pathways. In our opinion, this is an endeavor worth to be undertaken and continued in the future.",

Biosynthesis as preprocathepsins (light red) is at the rough endoplasmic reticulum from where the zymogen forms are transported via the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes for proteolytic processing yielding mature cathepsins (red). Procathepsins can also follow the secretory pathway when skipping recognition by CD-MPR at the TGN (left). Upon secretion, the procathepsins can be recaptured with the help of CI-MPR (green) at the plasma membrane (top, center). Retrograde transport of vesicles containing cathepsins recruited out of late endosomes or lysosomes explains the secretion of mature cathepsins into the extracellular space (bottom, right). LDL receptor-related proteins (LRPs; blue) serve as alternative cell surface receptors binding pro- and mature cathepsins for localized pericellular action (top, center) or re-internalization and delivery to endo-lysosomes. Specific forms of cathepsins are also present in the cytosol and in the nuclear matrix (pink-yellow), where they are involved in processing of transcription factors, core, and linker histones, in part by being bound to DNA. Secreted, extracellular cathepsins can interact, in principle, with viruses (cyan-violet-dark yellow) before endocytic entry (top, center), especially when bound to cell surface receptors like the CI-MPR (green) or an LRP (blue). In addition, cathepsins in the pericellular space may interfere by proteolytically processing viral proteins or by involving in shedding of cellular constituents, such as the glycocalyx, thereby enhancing the likelihood of viral entry. Moreover, it is possible, in principle, that cytosolic cathepsins (right, middle) mediate viral polyprotein processing, a proposal that remains speculative at this point",
