Modern tumour therapy utilises a numerous of high-dose chemotherapy protocols. This induces an increasing number of long-term neutropenia (>10 days) with definitive immuno-deficiency (Chanock 1993; H\u00f6ffken 1995) . In long-term neutropenia, the risk for infections rises to more than 85% (HiDDemann et al. 1996) . Furthermore, after initially successful empirical antibiotic treatment, an infectious relapse occurs in approximately 50% of the patients (Maschmeyer et al. 1994; Pizzo et al. 1982) . Thus, physicians are confronted with an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts showing non-specific clinical signs of infection. An empirical antibiotic strategy will be started initially, which covers the most frequent types of infections. This approach is very successful nowadays (Maschmeyer et al. 1994a, b; Maschmeyer 2001 ), but non-targeted. Because the underlying micro-organism remains unknown, empirical antibiotic strategy has several disadvantages: A de-escalation of a broad-spectrum to narrow an-\u2022 tibiotic usage, at least at the end of the infectious course, remains troublesome. This enhances costs for antibiotics as well as the rates of adverse effects, possibly over utilised drugs, and bacterial resistance.",

This early identification of the infection site is a major task for clinicians taking care for neutropenic patients. Frequently fever is the only sign for infection and different aetiologies have to be considered in this setting (Table 27 .1). The major role of the radiologist focuses on the detection of the focus of infection or non-infectious disease. If an organ is affected, invasive diagnostic procedures can be undertaken for identification of the underlying micro-organism. The acquired information helps to localise the most suspicious region within this organ. For example, the selection of a certain segment helps in guiding broncho-alveolar lavage or biopsy (Schaefer et al. 2001) . Furthermore, characterisation of the detected focus may give the clinician a clue for the underlying disease (Table 27 .3) (Tanaka et al. 2002a; Schaefer et al. 2001) . The detected focus might additionally serve as a practicable follow-up parameter to document the course of the infection and therapeutical success.",

Bacteria are covered sufficiently by antibiotic (antibacterial, i.e. neither antifungal nor antiviral) therapy (Maschmeyer et al. 1994) . If this approach fails or an infection breaks through, an antibacterial second-line treatment has limited success. The low cure rate of 30% in the second line demonstrates the limited role of antibiotic switching. Antifungal supplementation at this time point, however, reaches cure rates of up to 78% ( Fig.27 .1) (Maschmeyer et al. 1999 ). This underlines the point, that the early detection of nonbacterial pneumonia is the major task. From a clinical point of view, the detection of an ongoing bacterial infection appears less important than detecting nonbacterial pneumonia, e.g. fungal pneumonia.

Some referrers prefer CXR in supine position done on the ward to keep the neutropenic patients isolated.

In a study with 40 patients suffering from fever of unknown origin (FUO) after bonemarrow-transplantation (BMT), digital CXR in supine HRCT performed the same day demonstrates bilateral infiltrates, which were hidden behind the heart in posterior-anterior and the spine in lateral projection (c) c a,b Pneumonia position achieved a sensitivity for the early detection of pneumonia of only 46% (Weber et al. 1999) .

Any lowdose technique goes along with a loss of low-contrast information. However, this information is essential for the determination of pneumonia (ground-glass opacification). Radiation dose is not a real limitation in the investigation of neutropenic patients because they frequently receive radiation for conditioning therapy for transplantation (total body irradiation, TBI) in more than 1000 times higher dosages than for diagnostic purposes.

If CXR was normal at this time, HRCT was done. In approximately 60% of the patients with normal CXR, HRCT demonstrated infiltrates (Fig. 27.4) .

In advanced stages, CT and MRI are comparable in the visualisation of infiltrates (Leutner and SchilD 2001 as well as less susceptible to breathing artifacts. MRI is superior to CT in the detection of abscesses due to a clearer detection of central necrosis in T2w images and rim enhancement after contrast application in T1w images (Leutner et al. 2000) .

The use of thin-section MDCT is recommended for early detection of pneumonia (Maschmeyer et al. 1999) . The crucial fact is that CT allows for an optimisation for the indication and localisation of invasive diagnostic procedure, e.g. broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). On the other hand, the exclusion of pneumonia can be obtained with a higher confidence compared to the exclusive use of CXR.

On the other hand, the limited risk of radiological interventions in lungs or liver are known to radiologists: Risk for pneumothorax requiring therapy is less than 3% (Froelich and WaGner 2001) , for bleeding in liver lesions less than 2%. The probability to hit pulmonary nodules under CT guidance is approximately 95% (Froelich and WaGner 2001) . Using CT fluoroscopy, investigation time and sensitivity are improved especially in small lesions. Non-culture detection tests on the other hand are becoming widely available (Galactomannan antigen test, Platelia\uf6d9, Aspergillus-PCR) and reduce the necessity to perform invasive diagnostics procedures.",
