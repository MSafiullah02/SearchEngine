            "text": "Epigenetic modification is an important regulator of gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been a topic of considerable interest in the past few years. Of all epigenetic modifications, hypermethylation has been most extensively studied. Hypermethylation inhibits activation of promoters and therefore transcription of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing. Genes involved in all aspects of tumor development and growth can become aberrantly methylated, including those involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. As DNA methylation appeared to be a reversible process, drugs such as 5\u2032-azacytidine (azacitidine, Vidaza), 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (decitabine, DAC), and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being investigated for the treatment of a variety of tumors.",

            "text": "Decitabine, first synthesized by Pliml and Sorm [29], is an analog of 2\u2032-deoxycytidine, whereby the 5 carbon is replaced by nitrogen. Crystal structure analysis suggests the \u03b2-d-configuration [8] (Fig. 1). Decitabine is activated by phosphorylation via deoxycytidine kinase resulting in 5-aza-dCMP, which is rapidly converted to 5-aza-dCTP, a good substrate for DNA polymerase alpha [5, 46]. Deamination of decitabine or 5-aza-dCMP results in a complete loss of activity [6, 23]. When incorporated into DNA, decitabine inhibits DNA methylation at position 5. Decitabine is likely to have a dual mechanism of action: it may exert its effect via cytotoxic activity leading to cell death, but may also affect cell differentiation by demethylation leading to reactivation of genes that have previously been rendered inactive. Decitabine was first synthesized in appreciable amounts and formulated for therapeutic use in the early 1980s, and several methods were developed for its synthesis [20, 35, 36].\n\n",

In 1979, Professor Dr. R.L. Momparler (Montreal, Canada) described the pharmacological properties of decitabine [21]. Evidence for the antitumor activity of decitabine also started to mount around that time. Professor Dr. P.A. Jones in cooperation with Dr. S.M. Taylor (Los Angeles, USA) reported unique properties of the drug. Decitabine as well as azacitidine induced the expression of human hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in a human mouse cell hybrid. Two division cycles were required after decitabine treatment to obtain the highest frequency of expression of induced gene. The effect was related to demethylation of DNA. With decitabine, the effect was seen with one-tenth concentration of that of azacitidine [7]. Experimental evidence suggested a close relationship between cellular differentiation and DNA methylation [11]. Decitabine-induced inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in reactivation of an inactive X-chromosome locus [12]. Therapeutic approaches affecting the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells became the center of the research's attention [43]. Rivard et al. [41] observed a potent antileukemic effect in an early phase I study of decitabine in children with acute leukemia. Other researchers described the promising antitumor activity of decitabine alone and as an addition to the induction of DNA demethylation, which was later classified as epigenetic therapy [9].",

Dr. van Groeningen (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) carried out a phase I trial within the framework of the Early Clinical Trials Group (ECTG) of the EORTC [48]. The results of this trial led to recommendation of a dose of 75 mg m\u22122 decitabine as three 1-h infusions at intervals of 7 h every 5 weeks for subsequent phase II trials. The observed dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with a delayed white blood cell nadir, occurring at days 22\u201333. Other toxicities included mild, reversible elevation of serum creatinine, minimal nausea, vomiting, and transient fatigue. One partial response in a patient with an undifferentiated carcinoma of the ethmoid sinus was observed.

In some patients, inhibition of DNA methylation was observed; however, no cell differentiation was reported [22, 24]. Decitabine research took a decisive turn with the hematologist and inspired researcher, Dr. A. Pinto (Aviano, Italy), who had a deep understanding and visionary insight into the scientific and clinical possibilities of decitabine [30\u201333]. Clearly recognizing the epigenetic aspects and potential, Pinto envisaged future application of decitabine not only in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but also in sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, and he initiated a range of studies. Decitabine was found to stimulate dose-dependent irreversible hemoglobinization and morphological differentiation in the human erythroleukemic cell line, K562. In other in vivo experiments, decitabine was found to modify the leukemic cell phenotype, as demonstrated by changes in membrane differentiation antigens, growth factor receptors, and other cell surface structures. Transcription of c-myc oncogen was also altered. Unlike decitabine, azacitidine appeared to be highly toxic and had a lower induction capability. In clinical studies, Pinto used a low-dose administration schedule of 15\u201330 mg m\u22122 decitabine in MDS patients and 30, 60, or 90 mg m\u22122 in AML and CML in blastic phase (CML-bp) patients. Decitabine was given as 4-h infusion three times daily for three consecutive days every 28\u201335 days. Responses were seen in all disease categories studied. A patient with CML-bp showed a complete response (CR) with marked thrombocytosis, suggesting induction of a chronic phase. This response had already lasted for more than 2 years at the time of the last study report. Hematologic toxicity in this study was in line with previous experiences with decitabine. Lung toxicity, in particular adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), was noted, which may be the result of rapid cytolysis of leukemic lung infiltrates. In several patients, decitabine appeared to induce a clinical type II herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation [25].",

In 23 out of 26 evaluable courses, a short-lasting antileukemic effect was seen, six patients came into remission, one probably not Ara-C resistant achieved CR, and five achieved partial response (PR). Observed toxicity was acceptable and included in addition to the expected hematological toxicity, abnormalities of liver function tests [25]. Professors Dr. D.J. Richel and Dr. R. Willemze (Leiden, The Netherlands) continued to study decitabine in acute leukemia in both the laboratory and clinic. Different high-dose decitabine schedules were investigated, and the resulting recommended infusion schedule for decitabine was 125 mg m\u22122 as a 6-h infusion for 6 days, in combination with amsacrine 120 mg m\u22122 on days 6 and 7. Patients with AML refractory to Ara-C did not respond to decitabine. Of seven patients with a first relapse after Ara-C therapy, six achieved CR and one PR. At a high dose of decitabine (250 mg m\u22122), two patients developed neurological problems [25, 39, 40, 51]. In March 1989, many decitabine investigators attended a workshop on 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, to share their experiences [25].",

Investigators reported preclinical as well as clinical research results [34]. The relationship between DNA methylation and differentiation studied by Taylor and Attadia, suggested that decitabine is able to promote differentiation and activate maturation of cells via hypomethylation. They also attempted to identify genes involved in this process such as globin genes. Momparler presented in vitro results on the combination of decitabine and amsacrine, while Willemze shared preliminary results of a study comparing decitabine plus amsacrine vs decitabine plus idarubicin. In this study, decitabine was administered at a dose of 125 mg m\u22122 as a 6-h infusion every 12 h for 6 days. In cooperation with Professor F. Mandelli (Rome, Italy), Pinto studied MDS and poor prognosis AML using the schedule he had established in previous phase I\u2013II studies. The results of this study suggested that decitabine does induce trilineage response in unfavorable MDS and may also be effective in the treatment of AML patients with poor general condition and/or advanced age [34].",

Cytogenetic remission was found to be induced in a substantial number of elderly MDS patients with preexisting chromosomal abnormalities. Patients with cytogenetic responses had improved survival compared to patients without cytogenetic response and a persisting cytogenetically abnormal clone. The promising low-dose decitabine therapy in MDS fits well into the framework of epigenetic therapy [42].

In the larger study group, response rate in patients in the blastic phase was 28%, in the accelerated phase 55%, and chronic phase 63%. Treatment-related deaths were low at only 3%, and prolonged myelosuppression was the most important toxicity.

Decitabine has shown impressive results in AML as adjunctive to existing therapy, in the treatment of AML in elderly patients or those with poor prognosis, CML, stem cell transplant, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia. Our belief is that both in the laboratory as well as the clinic, decitabine research will continue to yield novel and exciting results that will hopefully improve cancer therapy. Whereas most drugs have reached the end of their life cycle after 40 years of development, decitabine is now only at the beginning. Its application might grow even further as our knowledge about epigenetic mechanisms and their relationship to drug therapy deepens.",
