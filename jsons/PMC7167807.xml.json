Their data suggested a fivefold increased risk for bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms, whereas influenza did not influence bipolar disorder without psychotic symptoms. This could be interpreted as an impact on clinical course as psychotic features stand for a more severe course of illness.24 Parboosing et al. observed a fourfold increased risk for bipolar disorder in general due to gestational influenza infection, regardless of the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms.23 However, on the other hand, the hypothesis of gestational viral infections increasing susceptibility to bipolar disorder could not be verified by either Pang et al.\n21 or Mortensen et al.\n22\n",

Manic episodes seem to be more frequently linked to seasonality than depressive episodes.41 Overall mania has its peaks in spring and summer and a third peak in mid\u2010winter, while depression shows high occurrence in winter and spring.37, 38 Furthermore, there are indications that climate factors, such as mean daylight hours, mean daily temperature, and the daily number of sunshine hours, are associated with relapse in bipolar disorder. The shortening of sunlight in particular triggers depressions.96 The relation between sunlight and mood states is furthermore supported by the positive therapeutic effect of phototherapy in mood disorders. Young et al. argue that this fact may lose importance due to the weakening of circadian rhythm in consequence of electric light.39 It is worth noting that a higher vulnerability to climate and seasonal changes has been reported in females.38 In contrast, Rajkumar et al. observed a greater degree of seasonality in men.40 In addition to that, these patients suffer more frequently from psychotic features and substance misuse.36, 41\n",

            "text": "A history of childhood trauma is common in patients with mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder. The prevalence of post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in bipolar disorder ranges from 16% to 39%.2, 97, 98 Childhood trauma in the broader sense is considered to be evident in almost 50% of patients with bipolar disorder.43 There are several bipolar patients who report childhood trauma and do not fulfill the criteria of PTSD. Still, childhood trauma is assumed to impact on the onset and the clinical course of bipolar disorder. So far, there are only four reviews that address childhood trauma. The association between childhood trauma and the onset and course of bipolar disorder has been established quite robustly.46, 47, 58, 98 The latest review by Aas et al. was published in January 2016.58 The most relevant findings of this review are: Childhood trauma influences the clinical course by leading to an earlier age of onset. It also increases the likelihood of a rapid cycling course, the occurrence of psychotic features, the number of lifetime mood episodes, the risk of suicide ideation and attempts, and substance misuse. Gender issues have been found as well. Females with bipolar disorder reported childhood trauma more frequently and had a stronger association with a more severe clinical course (i.e. rapid cycling, early age of onset, suicide attempts, and more depressive episodes).58 In contrast to that, Quarantini et al. showed that bipolar patients with trauma experienced more severe manic symptoms than depressive symptoms compared to controls.45 Sala et al. investigated dose\u2010response effects of childhood maltreatment and the course of bipolar disorder, including clinical characteristics, probability of treatment, and psychiatric comorbidities.52 There are different types of trauma, such as physical abuse and neglect, emotional abuse and neglect, and sexual abuse. Robust data on the epidemiology of trauma types and their impact on the onset and course of bipolar disorder are scarce. Most research into this field concentrated on physical and sexual abuse. But there are indications that emotional abuse and neglect have the highest prevalence among trauma subtypes.57, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103 Emotional abuse seems to be disregarded in the literature. One possible explanation is the difficulty to detect emotional abuse in assessment surveys. It is worth noting that bipolar patients gain traumatic experience not only due to childhood trauma, but also as a consequence of their own disruptive behavior during manic episodes.42\n",

            "text": "The term \u2018life events\u2019 describes any substantial changes in personal surroundings resulting in personal and social consequences. Life events might occur unexpectedly or in an anticipated manner. The social zeitgeber theory has recently gained attention. Social zeitgebers comprise social contact and solitary activities. Changes in social zeitgebers are followed by rhythm disruption in daily life.71 In consequence, biological circadian rhythms are disrupted and may affect mood stability.60, 72, 104 Numerous researchers have shown that certain life events influence the age of onset and the clinical course of bipolar disorder.7, 11, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68 The types of stressful life events differ in triggering either mania or depression. The literature emphasizes that positive life events and goal attainment are more likely to be followed by mania.66, 68, 70, 76 Others support the point of view that negative as well as positive life events are able to trigger both depression and mania.63, 65, 69, 70 Bereavement is assumed to trigger mania, while personal illness more likely causes depression.67 Interpersonal problems, financial crises, work\u2010related difficulties, failure, and job loss were often found prior to mania.73 Unemployment at onset is considered to be a risk factor of relapse and psychotic features.74, 80 A poor premorbid social status does not influence the course of bipolar disorder.80 Gershon et al. showed that trauma exposure is related to more severe interpersonal chronic stressors, which causes more severe depressive episodes.75 There are indications that living in a mixed urban\u2010rural area is associated with a higher risk of relapse.74 Minor life events have less influence on mood changes than severe life events or several consecutive life events.72, 76 The definition of minor and major life events, respectively, remains uncertain as the perception of burden is highly individual. Overall, the findings are heterogeneous. There exists one prospective study with a considerable sample size of 222 patients by Simhandl et al.\n77 More than 60% of the patients experienced at least one life event 6 months before a new episode. The risk of a depressive episode was associated with the number of life events, but was independent of the quality of the life event.77 The quantity of life events has also been investigated. An increased life event load stands for a higher risk of experiencing a first episode plus subsequent episodes.11, 67, 78 Whether life events are cause or consequence of mood changes is a topic debated frequently. Life events prior to subsequent episodes were discussed to be caused by the illness itself.11, 67, 76 Kemner et al. reported that life events in consequence to affective episodes were independent from the psychiatric illness itself.79 Furthermore, they report a slightly higher impact of life events on onset than on recurrence of bipolar disorder, which underlines Post's kindling hypothesis78, 79 that emphasizes that external triggers, such as life events, have a greater impact on the first episode than on subsequent episodes. Accordingly, recurrent episodes occur more autonomously and independently of life events.11, 105 In terms of life events over the lifespan, the decay model deserves mention. This model describes the fact that earlier life events will no longer have the same impact anymore as time passes. Due to life experience, people gain different coping strategies.64, 78 Thus, the kindling hypothesis is supported from another perspective.",

            "text": "Social support can be defined as the perception of being loved, cared for, esteemed, valued, and belonging to a network of communication and mutual obligation.106 As poor social support is considered a long\u2010term psychosocial stress, it has been a research topic in the field of psychiatric diseases. Its influence on bipolar disorder has been investigated as an important impact on clinical course of illness. The reverse influence of the severity of illness on social support should not be neglected. Up to now it has been poorly examined. Greenberg et al. published a review concerning social relationships in bipolar disorder. Emerging as the main results of this review is that individuals with bipolar disorder report deficits in many fields of social relationships, such as relationship to parents, family, partner, and friends.87 The rate of relapse is higher in patients with low social support.81, 82, 84, 87 Here again, the causality remains unclear. Johnson et al. report that patients with incomplete recovery between episodes receive less social support and that vice versa less social support leads to a residual status complicating socialization.84 Furthermore, the results show that having a partner at onset of illness has a positive effect on the course of illness, especially on the remission between episodes.84 Furthermore, patients without partners have an increased risk of psychotic features.80 Owen et al. investigated qualitative social factors that prevent or trigger suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.89 Overall, controversy surrounds the question of whether low social support influences the recurrence of mania or depression or both.81, 83, 84 In addition to social support, family behavior plays an influencing role on the course of bipolar disorder. High expressed emotions and negative affective styles increase the likelihood of a higher risk of relapse.85, 86 High expressed emotions may even influence the prevalence of suicide ideation in young bipolar patients.88 Miklowitz pointed out that patients who were more distressed by criticisms from their relatives showed more severe symptoms in both depression and mania.107 Overall, research in this field faces challenges and limitations. Instruments for investigating social support are usually self\u2010rating tools and the evaluation can often be influenced by mood episodes and a possible discrepancy between real and desired social integration. Consequently, the findings are inconsistent and need further investigation.",

Likewise, the impact of birth complications on onset and course of bipolar disorder needs further research efforts to allow for robust findings. There is relatively ample data on the influence of climatic factors on bipolar disorder. The occurrence of depressive and manic episodes shows replicable seasonal peaks.

Bipolar patients with trauma history are more likely to show rapid cycling course, psychotic features, higher number of lifetime mood episodes, and greater risk for suicide ideation and attempts, and substance misuse. It seems worthwhile highlighting that emotional abuse has been disregarded in the literature although it is supposed to have the highest prevalence among adverse childhood experiences. Additionally, there are interesting findings in molecular biology, genetics, and epigenetics that need to be vetted in large\u2010scale replication studies. Findings concerning the quality of live events remain inconsistent. As we might assume, social support influences the course of bipolar disorder, with low social support worsening the disease outcome. It is to be noted that live events and social support are influenced by the illness itself. Furthermore, there are national and cultural limitations to be pointed out. These have already been described by Merikangas in context of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative.4 The countries in which the trials were carried out are listed in Table 1. Nevertheless, there is no detailed information about the participants\u2019 ethnicity. The impact of life events, trauma, and social support on an individual varies across countries and cultures. For example, the actual impact of job loss on one's life will to a large part be determined by the level of social security or public welfare provided. In addition to that, the diagnosis of mental disorders is related to a different degree of stigmatization in different cultures and countries.",

First, there are fundamental limitations due to different diagnostic definitions. Mostly, the diagnostic interviews are based on the DSM and ICD; still there is a cross\u2010national and cross\u2010cultural variation remaining (for diagnostic criteria see Table 1). In general, apart from environmental factors, trauma, and life events (which influence the clinical course), the differences in the availability of mental health treatment may have an important but often neglected impact on the illness. Most of the studies are retrospective and only a few provide long\u2010term follow\u2010up data. Furthermore, inconsistency of study designs, measures, and analyses lead to partially inconsistent findings. There is an evident problem of how to categorize the influencing factors into further (sub\u2010) groups (see Fig. 1). Creating a standardized consensus categorization would simplify the comparison of research results. One approach has been reached by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders developing consensus nomenclature to describe course and outcome of bipolar disorder.108 Even if this could be achieved, other challenges remain: we have to consider the critical timing of events and the distinction between general and personal risk factors. The field furthermore needs to reach consensus on the most reliable and valid assessment tools: Structured or at least semi\u2010structured phenotyping tools may be preferred over self\u2010rating questionnaires. Moreover, prospective study designs should be favored over retrospective approaches. Finally, truly large samples sizes are needed. This will require international collaborative networks of peers.",
