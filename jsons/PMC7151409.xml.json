At present, there has been no universally recognized gold standard for initial diagnosis, and its initial diagnosis still relies on nucleic acid testing. The initial nucleic acid test was negative, whereas at this time characteristic lung changes appeared, by repeated nucleic acid tests, it was positive, as a result, a considerable number of early patients have been missed. Studying the relationships between nucleic acid tests and CT changes in the lungs will help improve the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

They had no history of lung infections before onset. Throat swabs were collected from patients. COVID-19 nucleic acid ORF1ab gene and N gene were taken as target genes [1], and RT-PCR was adopted to detect both as positive Nucleic acid-positive indicators. If the initial nucleic acid test is negative, the test will be repeated at least once a day until the test is positive. Based on the change of sheet-shaped frosted glass/flocculation/strand-like changes in the outer band of the lungs as COVID-19 lung CT positive indicators [2] (Fig. 1\n).

The latest Chinese standards were split into suspected cases and confirmed cases [3]. The diagnosis of suspected cases should be combined with epidemiological history and clinical manifestations. Epidemiological history includes: 1. history of travel or residence in the affected area; 2. history of contact with patients from epidemic areas with fever or respiratory symptoms or COVID-19; 3. aggressive onset [2]. Clinical manifestations consist of: 1 fever or respiratory symptoms; 2. characteristic lung imaging changes [2]. 3. The total number of white blood cells is normal or decreases in the early stage of onset, or the lymphocyte count decreases. The diagnostic criteria for suspected cases comply with any one of the epidemiological history and any two of the clinical manifestations. A suspected case with one of the following pathogenic evidence refers to a confirmed case: 1. PCR tests of COVID-19 nucleic acid positive for respiratory specimens or blood specimens [4]. 2. Respiratory or blood specimen virus gene sequencing is significantly homologous with known COVID-19 [2]. However, in numerous patients, the initial nucleic acid test was identified to be negative, and some patients were positive after repeating the test for 5 times. Before the nucleic acid was positive, the changes of CT has occurred in lung.",
