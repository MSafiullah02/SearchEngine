Many viral vector vaccines are in advanced clinical trials. The first such vaccine to be approved for marketing (to date in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines) is a vaccine against the flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis (JE), which employs a licensed vaccine (yellow fever 17D) as a vector. In this vaccine, two envelope proteins (prM-E) of YF 17D virus were exchanged for the corresponding genes of JE virus, with additional attenuating mutations incorporated into the JE gene inserts. Similar vaccines have been constructed by inserting prM-E genes of dengue and West Nile into YF 17D virus and are in late stage clinical studies. The dengue vaccine is, however, more complex in that it requires a mixture of four live vectors each expressing one of the four dengue serotypes. This vaccine has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials. No significant safety concerns have been found. The Phase 3 trials met their endpoints in terms of overall reduction of confirmed dengue fever, and, most importantly a significant reduction in severe dengue and hospitalization due to dengue. However, based on results that have been published so far, efficacy in preventing serotype 2 infection is less than that for the other three serotypes. In the development of these chimeric vaccines, an important series of comparative studies of safety and efficacy were made using the parental YF 17D vaccine virus as a benchmark. In this paper, we use a standardized template describing the key characteristics of the novel flavivirus vaccine vectors, in comparison to the parental YF 17D vaccine. The template facilitates scientific discourse among key stakeholders by increasing the transparency and comparability of information. The Brighton Collaboration V3SWG template may also be useful as a guide to the evaluation of other recombinant viral vector vaccines. \u00a9 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "a b s t r a c t"}, {"text": "1.1.

Analogous to the value embodied in standardized case definitions for AEFI, the V3SWG believes a standardized template describing the key characteristics of a novel vaccine vector, when completed and maintained with the latest research, will facilitate scientific discourse among key stakeholders by increasing the transparency and comparability of information. Fortunately, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) had already developed an internal tool to assess the risk/benefit of different viral vectors under its sponsorship. The IAVI graciously shared this tool with the V3SWG for adaptation and broader use as a standardized template for collection of key information for risk/benefit assessment on any viral vector vaccine. This tool was aimed at identifying potential major hurdles or concerns that would need to be addressed during the development of a vectored vaccine.

Need for risk/benefit assessment of live virus vaccines based upon a yellow fever vaccine backbone Yellow fever (YF) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus disease that is has long endangered persons in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical areas in South America and is associated with a case fatality rate of 20-50% [15] . Since no effective anti-yellow fever virus medications are available and current mosquito-control measures are inadequate, vaccination remains paramount to YF prevention and control. Although appropriately controlled efficacy studies have never been carried out, the decline in YF cases following vaccination campaigns and the production in most studies of neutralizing antibodies in more than 95% of vaccinees are considered sufficient evidence that the 17D vaccine is effective. Regulations call for the vaccine to be administered every ten years; however, a recent recommendation by WHO's Strategic Advisory Group is that the vaccine need only be given once [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1019, "end": 1023, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1691, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preamble"}, {"text": "The live, attenuated YF 17D vaccine was previously deemed to be the world's safest and a model for the development of other live virus vaccines including polio, measles, mumps and varicella.

In 2001, however, severe rare reactions that were frequently fatal became recognized [17] [18] [19] .

Another aspect of the chimeric flavivirus technology that is distinguished from other viral vectors, is that anti-vector immunity is not a significant problem for flavivirus vaccine development. This feature is due to the fact that the prM-E region is solely responsible for generating epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the chimeric vector contains the only neutralizing antigens of the intended target for immunization.

For example, the monkey neurovirulence test is an important measure of safety of YF 17D vaccines, and YF 17D was used as the reference strain in many studies, which showed that the chimeric vaccines were more attenuated than parental YF 17D.

Wt dengue virus infects a large variety of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, DCs and possibly endothelial cells.

No evidence in wild-type yellow fever of humans, but not specifically studied. One report of RNA genomes of YF 17D in urine of humans approx. 6 mos. after vaccination. Chronic infection with West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and TBE have been described in animal models and in humans By agency of blood feeding Aedes and Haemagogus spp. mosquitoes YF 17D vaccine incapable of infecting mosquitoes. Recombinants produced by the insertion of dengue 4, JE and WN prM-E genes into wild-type YF showed a significant decrease in infectivity for mosquito vectors compared to wild-type YF Both wild-type and vaccine induced immunity against future or repeated infection principally via neutralizing antibodies. Innate immune responses play an important role in early defense. CTLs responsible for clearing infection and recovery Defects in innate immunity (interferon pathways) may underlie susceptibility of rare individuals to severe vaccine associated SAEs (YEL-AVD). Interferon receptor k/o mice develop viscerotropic disease Chimerization (replacement of structural membrane and envelope genes (prM-E) with genes from another flavivirus). Evidence that chimerization itself contributes to attenuation also comes from experiments showing that insertion of prM-E genes from wt DENV 4 in a wt YF Asibi backbone results in decreased virulence. Multiple mutations in the YF 17D non-structural genes that occurred during empirical passage to develop the attenuated 17D vaccine. In some vaccine constructs, mutations were also inserted in the prM-E genes of the gene donor virus to decrease neurovirulence (WN vaccine). For constructing the chimeric JE vaccine, prM-E genes from the attenuated SA1414.2 vaccine were used, already containing some mutations as compared to wt JE virus", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "The viruses cause CPE in vitro at low multiplicities of infection (MOI). wild-type virus in chicken embryo cultures resulting in the acquisition of nucleotide mutations some of which do not cause changes in the translated amino acids (synonymous) and some of which do (non-synonymous).

The YF-17D viral genome excluding the prM-E genes is referred to as the \"backbone\".
