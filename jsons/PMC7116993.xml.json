According to the relational theory of public relations, public relations is \u201cthe management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends on\u201d (Cutlip, Center, & Broom, 1994, p. 2). As media practitioners are a unique group within the public (Shin, 2006), the relational perspective also applies to the interaction between journalists and sources such as government officials. There are many definitions of the organizational\u2013public relationship (see Berko et al., 1997, Broom et al., 2000, Hung, 2005, Ledingham and Bruning, 1998), and all feature interaction, interdependence and mutual influence as key components (Ki, 2006). These three components capture the essence of the symbiotic relationship between journalists and government officials/sources; reporters and government sources cannot survive without each other.",

In public relations scholarship, the relationship cultivation strategies consist of six dimensions and were initially derived from interpersonal communication research. These strategies are mutually beneficial and meant to create symmetric organizational\u2013public relationships (Hon & Grunig, 1999). The dimensions are access, positivity, openness,2\nsharing of tasks, social networks and assurance (Hon and Grunig, 1999, Ki, 2006). Although these strategies apply to both organizations and the public, this study focuses solely on the actions of organizations (i.e., the Chinese government officials) toward the public (i.e., foreign reporters).",

Journalists always deem news conferences to be valuable opportunities to talk to high-level people in a face-to-face manner.

A simple \u201cno\u201d may give reporters the impression that a public relations practitioner or the client intends to hide facts (Howard & Mathews, 1985). This response will lead journalists and readers/viewers to draw their own conclusions (Gregory, 2000) and to contact competing sources for commentary (Howard & Mathews, 1985). Media relations consultants suggest that if clients are not able to give a straightforward answer to reporters\u2019 inquiries, they should explain why there is no direct answer to the question (Howard & Mathews, 1985). This type of explanation may help the client build a good relationship with the reporter, which may be useful in the future (Stewart, 2004). Media relations consultants also advise interviewees to take a fact-based approach during an interview, as reporters appreciate facts (Stewart, 2004).",

In collaboration with journalism schools across China and renowned Chinese journalists, the Chinese government arranged training workshops for press officers regarding the principles of public relations and methods for approaching journalists. The frequency of news conferences has increased. The number of news conferences held by the Press Office of the State Council of China (POSCC) grew from 20 in 2002 to 68 in 2005 (POSCC, 2005). The strict travel restriction placed upon foreign journalists was suspended January 1, 2007, to provide journalists with better access to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games; the Chinese offered to establish this suspension when they placed their bid for the Olympic Games. According to the new temporary regulation, journalists do not need to request permission from authorities to travel to open areas except Tibet. Although this Olympic Game-specific regulation was suspended, a new regulation that inherits the essence of the Olympic regulation came into effect on October 17, 2008. The Chinese government's rhetoric towards the foreign media changed during this period. The Chinese government frequently used words such as \u201csimilar mutual benefits,\u201d \u201ccooperation\u201d and \u201cjoint effort.\u201d These terms are completely different from the anti-capitalism words used in the past (Zhang, 2008).",

Within the same bureaucracy, different officials have different responsibilities, and sometimes a problem or issue is related to several ministries. Therefore, with more officials present at a news conference, the sources are more appropriate and more journalists\u2019 questions can likely be answered. Second, the researcher must account for the officials\u2019 levels in the political hierarchy. In general, the higher the officials\u2019 position, the closer they are to the decision-making process; thus, higher-ranking officials can potentially offer more \u201cauthoritative\u201d information on an issue or a policy.

An increase in the amount of time spent responding to domestic journalists\u2019 questions is equivalent to a reduction in the amount of time spent responding to foreign journalists\u2019 questions. In some cases, prior to the start of a news conference, Chinese officials give Chinese journalists small slips printed with questions that the officials wish to be asked. The Chinese officials then read their prepared responses (personal communication with a reporter who worked for a state-owned news agency, 2008; Wen, 2007). Chinese journalists cooperate in this manner because the Chinese media were formerly run by the government; even now, most media are subject to strict regulations. A similar tactic is employed by US press officers, as well, particularly President Clinton's press secretaries Mike McCurry and Joe Lockhart (Hess, 2005). The term \u201cfoil\u201d defines the act of controlling the direction of news briefings (Hess, 2005). When US spokespersons expect US journalists\u2019 questions to be harsh, they sometimes offer foreign reporters the opportunity to pose questions that change the direction of the news conference.",

Furthermore, in four conferences, all questions were posed by foreign reporters; thus, the denominator in calculating this ratio is zero, and the ratio cannot be calculated.

Additionally, verbally responding to a question does not mean that the question is actually answered. For instance, an ideologically loaded response does not constitute a meaningful answer. \u201cIdeological\u201d means that officials\u2019 responses to journalists\u2019 questions are not substantive and do not address the journalists\u2019 concerns.

A topic that was \u201cextremely sensitive\u201d referred to a problem faced by the Chinese government that remained unresolved for many years and that damaged the interests of international stakeholders.
