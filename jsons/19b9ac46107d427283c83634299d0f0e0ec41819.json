            "text": "caused catastrophes on economic development, and became one of the major public health concerns. [1] [2] [3] Among them, the AIV, a lipid enveloped RNA virus of type A avian influenza virus in the orthomyxoviridae family, can cause acute respiratory infection in birds. [4, 5] The highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 AIV has caused deadly outbreaks of domestic poultry in China, Southeast Asian, Middle East, and European countries since early 2000. In the United States, an HP H5N2 AIV epidemic resulted in depopulations of more than 30.7 million birds in 15 affected states between 2014 and 2015. [6] Moreover, pandemic human influenza is at high risk due to the continuing mutations of the avian origin AIVs. [5, 7] Therefore, it is critically urgent to develop fast and sensitive methods to closely monitor the presence of the AIV in vulnerable host population and quickly detect it during the early stage of the infection, [3, 5] so that immediate prevention and control procedures can be adopted to prevent virus spread and disease outbreaks. In this work, AIV was used as the diagnostic target, although the platform itself is applicable to all pathogens with available antibodies. Rapid and simultaneous detection of multiple potential pathogens by portable devices can facilitate early diagnosis of infectious diseases, and allow for rapid and effective implementation of disease prevention and treatment measures. The development of a ZnO nanorod integrated microdevice as a multiplex immunofluorescence platform for highly sensitive and selective detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) is described. The 3D morphology and unique optical property of the ZnO nanorods boost the detection limit of the H5N2 AIV to as low as 3.6 \u00d7 10 3 EID 50 mL \u22121 (EID 50 : 50% embryo infectious dose), which is \u224822 times more sensitive than conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The entire virus capture and detection process could be completed within 1.5 h with excellent selectivity. Moreover, this microfluidic biosensor is capable of detecting multiple viruses simultaneously by spatial encoding of capture antibodies. One prominent feature of the device is that the captured H5N2 AIV can be released by simply dissolving ZnO nanorods under slightly acidic environment for subsequent off-chip analyses. As a whole, this platform provides a powerful tool for rapid detection of multiple pathogens, which may extent to the other fields for low-cost and convenient biomarker detection.",

[2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] The existing virus detection approaches face some notable challenges, for example, poor sensitivity and specificity, time-consuming and complicated procedures, and sophisticated sample pretreatment. These drawbacks limit the accessibility and usability of the quantitative diagnostics. A viable solution to these problems is to develop a rapid, robust, selective, and sensitive system that does not depend on signal amplification and yet sensitive enough for routine AIV screening.",

[14] [15] [16] [17] [18] They have many benefits such as system integration, [18] [19] [20] portability, [21] [22] [23] [24] low sample consumption and waste generation, [20, 25] reagents and time saving, [2, 18, 26] fast mass transfer, and convenience and suitability for portable applications. [14, [21] [22] [23] 27] Microfluidic devices can be employed in the detection of pathogens for practical samples and medical diagnosis. [2, 5, 28, 29] Meanwhile, multiplexed detection is feasible in microfluidic chips with spatial encoding technique. [23, 29, 30] Although there are some microfluidic-based sensing platforms for the detection of pathogens. [31, 32] However, most of the biosensors are focused on the single detection in microfluidic chip. [5, 22] Some microfluidic-based sensing platforms for pathogens are using the signal amplification methods in order to obtain quantitative performance such as microfluidics-based PCR platform, [2] loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), [33] and rolling circle amplification (RCA). [34] In general, these methods require sophisticated fabrication process, complex operations, circular DNA template, and specifically designed primer pairs or enzymes. Therefore, the highly sensitive and multiplex pathogen detection in the microfluidic chips without complex signal amplification is still much needed.",

            "text": "Rough 3D nanostructured surfaces have garnered much interest for microfluidics and biosensor development. [28, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] For the same apparent surface area, the 3D nanostructured surfaces provide more binding sites for capture probes and targets, generate different surface properties (e.g., superhydrophobicity) from the flat surface, [37] enhance detection signals, and supply topological and morphological features to encourage the interaction between device surface and nanoscale objects, such as proteins, nucleic acid molecules, and the microfilament/pseudopodium of cells. [30, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] Meanwhile, the diffusion distance is efficiently reduced for antibodies and pathogens within the nanostructures, [30, 45] which accelerates the diffusion-dependent steps in pathogen capture and detection. Silicon pillars etched by hydrofluoric acid with the aid of Ag + are commonly used for bioassays, such as circulating tumor cell enrichment, [46, 47] virus capture, [48] and bacterial detection. [49] However, the substrate for silicon pillars is not transparent, which limits its applications in the biosensor platforms that use optical detection. ZnO is a semiconductor material and is widely applied in energy harvesting and conversion. [50, 51] The controllable growth of the semitransparent ZnO nanostructures (ZnO nanowires or nanorods) directly on glass substrate is more feasible for biosensors based on optical detection. Previous reports suggest that ZnO nanostructures can enhance the biomolecular fluorescence intensity. [52, 53] We hypothesize that the high surface-to-volume ratio and intensified fluorescence of the ZnO nanostructure can significantly improve the sensitivity of the immunoassays for pathogen detection. Furthermore, the integration of the nanomaterials into microfluidic chips not only provides the capability for pathogen capture and detection but also enables portable multiplex pathogen assays by spatial encoding. In this paper, we report a new ZnO nanorods integrated microchip (ZnO-NIM) that captures AIV on immunologically functionalized ZnO nanorod surface and detect viruses by multiplexed sandwich immunoassay. To improve the interaction on the ZnO nanorod surface, herringbone structures were incorporated inside the microfluidic device for enhanced mixing. [54, 55] Highly selective detection of H5N2 subtype AIV is achieved by fast continuous flow in the microfluidic channels that effectively minimizes nonspecific adsorption. [2, 29, 56] The entire detection process could be completed within 1.5 h, while the limit of detection (LOD) for the H5N2 AIV was measured as 3.6 \u00d7 10 3 EID 50 mL \u22121 . This platform shows the capability for simultaneous detection of multiple viral pathogens by spatial encoding different antibodies onto the same ZnO-NIM. Moreover, we further demonstrated the captured H5N2 AIV could be released by simply dissolving the ZnO nanorods in acidic environment and the released H5N2 AIV could be detected by the real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The successful virus release enables subsequent off-chip analyses of the captured viruses by ZnO-NIM, which complements to the on-chip multiplexed sandwich immunoassay and greatly expands its capability.",

            "text": "The ZnO nanorod slides are translucent ( Figure 1C ) and can be directly used for the fluorescence imaging under transmitted light illumination, which is impossible for the opaque silicon nanopillars. Although the ZnO nanorod slides are translucent, they provide a better surface for fluorescence detection compared with bare glass slides. The fluorescence enhancement property of the semitransparent ZnO nanostructured glass substrate helps to boost up the overall detection sensitivity (Section S4, Figure S4 , Supporting Information) by 70% for 100 nm fluorescent beads and 30% for fluorophores. The effect is purely optical and caused by neither larger surface area nor more fluorophores. It agrees with previous reports on the fluorescence enhancement effect randomly aligned ZnO nanorods, which is better than the vertical growth ZnO nanowires. [60, 61] Interfacial electron transfer and evanescence waveguide of the ZnO nanostructures may attribute to the fluorescence enhancement effect we observed. [62, 63] The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra pattern of the ZnO nanorods modified glass ( Figure 1D [64] The XRD pattern contains no impurity peaks, indicating the high purity of the ZnO nanorods and perfect phase transformation. Observing under optical microscope, the ZnO nanorod slide has a homogeneous roughness, which is highly desirable in fluorescence imaging detection ( Figure 1E ). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the ZnO nanorod slide ( Figure 1F assigned to the stretching vibration mode of hydroxyl group, a peak at 1585 cm \u22121 that may be attributed to the first overtone of the crucial stretching mode of hydroxyl group, and peaks at 1388 and 876 cm \u22121 that can be ascribed to the incorporated carbonate. The hydroxyl group could be easily modified with various silane reagents with functional groups, such as \ue0c6NH 2 , \ue0c6SH, \ue0c6C\ue0cbC, and so on. [35, 49, 58] Figure 2 depicts the design principle of immunological capture and on-chip sandwich immunoassay for pathogen detection in a ZnO-NIM. Details on the design and fabrication of the device are described in the Experimental Section and Section S1 (Supporting Information) (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). The ZnO-NIM adopts regular hexagon geometry for multiplexed detection of a maximum of six pathogens. Each side of the hexagon corresponds to one potential pathogen. Before the immunoassays, different capture monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are conjugated to the ZnO nanorod surface on different hexagonal sides of the ZnO-NIM. First loading reagents and the sample, the target pathogens can be captured on the mAb-ZnO surface of one or multiple branched channels ( Figure 2B ). After washing with buffer, the interfering pathogens and contaminants are washed out of the device by the continuous high-speed flow. The herringbone structure in the ZnO-NIM increases the liquid mixing thus enhances the chances of interactions between the target pathogen and the mAb on the ZnO surface. After pathogen capture, biotin-labeled detection monoclonal antibodies (detection mAb-biotin) are loaded into the ZnO-NIM device and allowed to react with the captured pathogen to generate the sandwich immune complexes ( Figure 2C ). Fluorescence signal is generated using cyanine dye-conjugated streptavidin (Cy3-SA) by utilizing the high affinity between biotin and streptavidin [5, 65] (dissociation constant on the order of \u224810 \u221214 m). The large and rough ZnO nanostructured surface provides a large number of binding sites for pathogen capture and shortens the diffusion distance for the target and reagents. www.small-journal.com in various solutions. The nanostructured ZnO nanorod surface was first treated with (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) to obtain the epoxy groups that can react with the \ue0c6NH 2 , \ue0c6SH, or \ue0c6OH group at different pH conditions. After the GPTMS modification, the adsorption band for hydroxyl group around 3376 cm \u22121 in the FT-IR spectrum disappeared, suggesting the successful modification with epoxysilane (Section S5, Figure S5 , Supporting Information). Then the H5 mAb was conjugated to the GPTMS-modified ZnO nanorod surfaces through epoxy ring-opening reaction. Unreacted epoxy groups on the ZnO nanorod surfaces were blocked with the methoxy polyethylene glycol thiol (mPEG-SH) and the bovine serum albumin (BSA). Figure 3B ,C provides SEM images of the ZnO nanorods on the glass slides after modification of the H5 mAb for H5N2 AIV. The H5 mAbmodified area on the ZnO slide was darker than unmodified area that lies outside of the microfluidic channel with the same imaging process and condition ( Figure 3B ), which implied the H5 mAb were conjugated onto the ZnO nanorods. As it is well known that ZnO nanoparticles or ZnO nanorods can dissolve at the acidic condition, the stability of ZnO nanorods on the microfluidic channel should be characterized after the modification of H5 mAb. The morphology of H5 mAb modified ZnO nanorods remained the same after surface modification as the pure ZnO nanorods, which confirmed that the ZnO nanorods were stable during the neutral pH condition of H5 mAb modification. Surface functionalization with other capture antibodies follows the same procedure.",

First, ZnO-nanostructured glass slides and bare glass slides were H5 mAb modified with or without the covalent linker GPTMS. Then DyLight-conjugated goat antimouse IgG was used to react with the primary H5 mAb. Fluorescence images were recorded under exactly the same conditions and analyzed to evaluate the performance of H5 mAb surface modification. As shown in Figure 4 , after the DyLightconjugated goat antimouse IgG reacted with the H5 mAb, the fluorescence intensities of the bare glass slides, GPTMSmodified glass slides, ZnO-nanostructured glass slides, and GPTMS-modified ZnO nanostructured glass slides were 6170 \u00b1 158, 12 852 \u00b1 787, 51 110 \u00b1 3456, and 58 966 \u00b1 2060 (A.U.), respectively.

The ZnO nanorods significantly increase fluorescence signal intensity. It is worth to note that, even without the GMPTS modification, the ZnO slides show a high fluorescence after incubated with the H5 mAb overnight. The statistical significance between the H5 mAb conjugation on the GMPTSmodified ZnO and that on unmodified ZnO (p value = 0.0382) is much lower than that of others (p values < 0.001, Although the more specific chemical adsorption mediated by GMPTS seems to play a minor role, the GMPTS-modified ZnO slide shows higher and more stable fluorescence intensity than that of the ZnO nanorods without the GMPTS modification.

To test the specificity of our ZnO-NIM for the H5N2 AIV, we tested seven samples including one negative control of allantoic fluid (AF), one target H5N2 AIV, three nontarget AIV subtypes of H1N1, H3N2, and H7N2, and two other viruses of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and Nebraska-calf-diarrhea virus (NCDV).

For the target H5N2 AIV of 3.6 \u00d7 10 6 EID 50 mL \u22121 , the fluorescence intensity increased to 52 013 (A.U.), which was tenfold higher than that of the negative AF control and nontarget virus samples. The high specificity of this method for the H5N2 AIV could be attributed to the high specificity of H5 mAb for the H5N2 AIV, [7] minimized nonspecific interactions on the ZnO nanorod surfaces due to BSA and mPEG-SH blocking, and the continuous washing under high flow rate (120 \u00b5L min \u22121 ).

            "text": "We studied whether the sandwich ELISA implemented inside the ZnO-NIM can improve the sensitivity over the conventional immunoassay for H5N2 AIV detection. The H5N2 AIVs were cultured in embryonated chicken eggs and the concentration of the AIVs was calculated to 3.6 \u00d7 10 6 EID mL \u22121 as our previous report. [28] Serial dilutions of H5N2 AIV samples were prepared for final virus titers of 3.6 \u00d7 10 2 , 3.6 \u00d7 10 3 , 3.6 \u00d7 10 4 , 1.8 \u00d7 10 5 , 3.6 \u00d7 10 5 , and 3.6 \u00d7 10 6 EID 50 mL \u22121 . Viruses were detected inside ZnO-NIM by sandwich immunoassay using H5 specific mAb for H5N2 AIV. The fluorescence images of on-chip H5N2 AIV detection with different virus concentrations are shown in Figure 6A -H. As summarized in the dose-response curve of Figure 6I , the fluorescence intensity increased as the virus concentration increased. The negative AF control from healthy chicken showed negligible fluorescence, even though it was a complex sample itself. Although the fluorescence intensity for 3.6 \u00d7 10 2 EID 50 mL \u22121 of the H5N2 AIV sample is slightly higher than the negative AF control, based on the criteria that fluorescence intensity needs to be at least threefold of the standard deviation higher than that of the negative control, [29] the LOD for the sandwich immune assay implemented in ZnO-NIM for H5N2 AIV is determined as 3.6 \u00d7 10 3 EID 50 mL \u22121 . Therefore, the H5N2 AIV sample above this concentration can be statistically detectable by our method that does not implement any signal amplification strategy. Our results show that the sandwich immunoassay implemented in the ZnO-NIM www.small-journal.com is \u224822 times more sensitive than the conventional sandwich ELISA method for the H5N2 AIV using the same H5 mAb (Section S6, Figure S6 , Supporting Information). There are several reasons for the high sensitivity of this ZnO-nanostructure-based immunoassay platform. First, compared to flat bare glass surface, the 3D ZnO nanorods modified surface has more binding sites for the mAbs. Second, the diffusion distance between the surface and species in the flow (virus samples, mAb, and other reagents) is decreased. Compared to previous reports, our biosensor shows a higher or at the same range of the sensitivity without any signal amplification and good specificity (Section S9, Table S1 , Supporting Information). The high sensitivity could partially be attributed to the enhanced fluorescence by ZnO nanorods. Furthermore, we believe that ZnO-NIM can be used for other biosensing applications such as superbugs, nucleic acids, proteins, and other microorganisms with available reagents. Although the fluorescence enhancement and semitransparency benefit fluorescence detection on ZnO nanostructured glass device, the ZnO-NIM itself is not limited by fluorescence detection and can be potentially used with other detection methods.

This concept is demonstrated in Figure 7A , where food dye solutions with various colors were introduced to different microfluidic branch channels of a ZnO-NIM. We performed simultaneous detection of two AIV subtypes (H5N2 and H7N2) in a single ZnO-NIM ( Figure 7B ). As summarized in Figure 7C , the branched channels I, II, and III were modified with the H5 mAb specific for H5N2 AIV and the branched channels IV, V, and VI were modified with the H7 mAb specific for H7N2 AIV. After washing with phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the branched channels I and VI were loaded with PBS without virus, while H5N2 and H7N2 AIVs were introduced to branched channels II, IV and branched channels III, V, respectively. After incubation and washing, a mixture of H5 mAb-biotin and H7 mAb-biotin was loaded into all the branched microchannels to generate sandwich immune complexes. Followed by additional washing, secondary labeling reagent Cy3-SA was then loaded and reacted with the biotin on the primary mAb. The results showed that only branched microchannels that had matching capture mAb and virus subtype (e.g., channel II: H5 mAb and H5N2 AIV sample; channel V: H7 mAb and H7N2 AIV sample) presented strong fluorescence. This proof-of-concept experiment suggests that our method has a good specificity for complicated scenario of simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. With the advantages of multiplexed detection, high sensitivity, and high specificity, the ZnO-NIM provides a promising portable tool for diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.",

At 25 \u00b0C, ZnO dissolves in acidic buffer with pH lower than 6.7 and becomes Zn 2+ . [68] With this unique property of ZnO, the captured targets can be released from ZnO-NIM. This significantly expands the usability of the platform well beyond the ELISA demonstrated in this current work. For emerging viruses, the released viruses can be isolated and cultured. Furthermore, the virus titer can be quantified by more sensitive molecular assay like the rRT-PCR. More importantly, the whole genomes of released viruses can be determined by various next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods for studies important for viral pathogenesis, adaptability and genetic diversity of viruses, and epidemiology and transmission dynamics during disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the ZnO nanorods integrated microdevice is easily fabricated, cheap, and disposable. The ZnO-NIM might be regenerated by using complex chemical method, such as DNA strand displacement, [69] which needs the DNA modified on the surface and the DNA conjugated antibodies. In this paper, we proved that the 3D nanostructured surfaces could be integrated into the microfluidic chips for highly sensitive pathogen detection. The composing elements of the 3D nanostructured surfaces are not only limited to the ZnO nanorods, but also other nanomaterials, such as TiO 2 , [44] which can be self-cleaned by UV treatment and regenerated by simple method. This nanostructured surface based on TiO 2 might be used in microfluidics for pathogen detection in the future.

The ZnO nanorods are synthesized on the KMnO 4 activated glass slides in a low-cost and scalable batch process that does not depend on cleanroom facilities. We implemented a multiplex ELISA assay on ZnO-NIM. We can detect H5N2 AIV at virus concentration as low as 3.6 \u00d7 10 3 EID 50 mL \u22121 using ZnO-NIM, which is \u224822-fold more sensitive compared with conventional ELISA. This high sensitivity could be attributed to more conjugation sites on rough 3D ZnO nanorod surface and the reduction of the diffusion distance between mAb-ZnO and pathogens. In addition, although the glass substrate becomes semitransparent after ZnO nanorod growth, the rough nanostructure does not interfere with fluorescence detection, yet enhances it optically by 30%-70%. Although immunoassays in general have lower sensitivity than molecular assays like rRT-PCR, their flexibility, portability, and low price still make them a preferred method in many practical applications for pathogen detection. The specificity of ZnO-NIM was validated by distinguishing the target virus from negative AF sample and several samples containing nontarget viruses. Furthermore, by conjugating different mAb on different branched microchannels of the same ZnO-NIM, the device can be used for multiplexed detection of pathogens in complex samples. By dissolving the ZnO nanorods at a slightly acidic buffer (pH 6.0), the captured H5N2 AIV can be released and recovered for the subsequent analyses. This sensitive, selective, multiplex portable technology and the integrated fluorescence sandwich immunoassay can be expanded to detect other pathogens and disease biomarkers.",

The antibody was coated on the microchannel surfaces by overnight incubation to allow epoxy ring-opening reaction to happen. Then the ZnO-NIM was washed with 50 \u00d7 10 \u22123 m Tris buffer and incubated with 1% (w/w) mPEG-SH for 1 h to block the unreacted epoxy group. Finally, the antibody conjugated surfaces were blocked with 5% (w/w) BSA solution for 30 min to reduce nonspecific adsorption. For multiplex virus detection, the procedure was repeated for the branched microchannels on different hexagonal sides of ZnO-NIM using different antibodies.",
