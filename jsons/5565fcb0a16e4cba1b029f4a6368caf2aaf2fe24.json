We estimated latent class models based on the ordinal scoring (high, moderate, none/low) of the 25 subscales from a standardized assessment administered at intake. In order to test whether groups were distinct, we examined a range of variables, including the official risk classification and recidivism rates measured by officieal rearrests and reconvictions. We report the demographic differences between the estimated groups, as well as adverse childhood experiences, school and employment status, previous legal history, and substance use history. Ultimately, the seven-class model produced four groups that others have noted: a relatively low needs (lowest need), relatively high needs (complex needs), substance use service needs, and mental health service needs. The other three groups that emerged include two gender specific groups (one for male and one for female high-need groups) and a group with skills needs that lacks supportive and protective skills. The analyses will facilitate a better appreciation for the service needs of moderate risk youth. Youth on probation are not a uniform population; they reflect tremendous heterogeneity, and probation systems should embrace systemic responsivity to provide appropriate services to improve youth outcomes. Advancing efforts to provide a broader spectrum of services that address multi-morbid conditions can ensure that youth have opportunities to improve their quality of life during the period of supervision.",

Youth on probation have high recidivism rates, and we lack a systematic understanding of how sanctions and interventions can facilitate a process of desistance (Mulvey et al., 2004; Mulvey & Schubert, 2012) . We also lack information on how to build systems of care that promote positive youth development and address the unmet needs of the youth through evidence-based programming. For example, many interventions focus on a single need area (e.g. education, substance abuse, mental illness, etc.). They therefore cannot address the myriad of needs that youth present. Few programs deal with multi-need issues, youth case workers tend to lack the skills to address multi-needs, and the system lacks the resources to handle complex issues like suicide, HIV risk behaviors, or even the COVID-19 pandemic. We could vastly improve our interventions to support youth involved in the juvenile justice system to promote successful transitions to adulthood and maximize their future contributions. This study contributes to our systematic knowledge base through an examination of the complex needs of these youth, with the goal of informing intervention design, services, and policies. The study calls for a systemic responsivity system for youth in the justice system.",

Risk and need assessments in criminal and juvenile justice refer to actuarial assessments that identify various factors that promote or inhibit involvement in crime (Slobogin, 2013) . Dynamic risk and protective factors may change due to maturation and learned skills while static factors do not (Slobogin, 2013) . Typical static factors include age of first arrest, number of arrests, number of detentions, and other characteristics of justice involvement. Dynamic factors include community/family support, substance use behaviors, values, attitudes, and educational achievements. Risk and need assessments identify services and interventions that can minimize the static risk factors and bolster the dynamic protective factors (Jones et al., 2016) .",

Another found that substance dependence and criminal cognitions predict outcomes better than family support, peer associations, or other factors (Taxman & Caudy, 2015) . Also, individual level risk factors may cluster, such as in environmental situations in more disordered neighborhoods. Thus exclusionary discipline incidents may seem like individual factors but be far more common in under-resourced schools (Rodriguez, 2013) .

Identifying the state of pattern of youth risk and need factors as they enter probation can provide insight into possible categories of youth needs that could drive service \"packages\" to address the unmet youth needs.

The VLMR was significant until the estimation of the model with 8 classes, suggesting that the seven-class model was better. Thus, we explored the four-, five-, six-, and seven-class models. All of the models consistently produced similar groups (e.g., one with lowrisk with high-protective factors, one with high-risk with low-protective factors group). The five-, six-, and seven-class solutions included gender-specific groups of a high-risk group that was predominately female and one that was predominately male.

Researchers should attend more to the decision-making processes that determine how authorities use information from the risk and need assessment tools in case management decisions or individualizing treatment (Miller & Mahoney, 2013; Viglione, et al., 2015) . For example, the agency that provided the data for this study illustrates that tension regarding collecting and using the data. As the developers of the YASI have recommended, the juvenile justice agency classified youth as none/low, moderate, or high risk based on the abbreviated YASI Pre-Screen, which consists of 34 items across nine domains (Jones et al., 2016) . The agency also administers the full YASI, as Jones et al. (2016) recommend for case planning purposes. Yet, the risk category is driving the programming assignment due to limited programs and interventions in the system; needs do not play an instrumental role in identifying the nature and type of services the youth receive.",

These four groups mirror the literature on needs and the research suggests they are consistent across multiple samples. At the same time, the results from this study yield some important distinctions, especially in light of the two new gender-specific groups that emerged in this study. The mental health needs group reported higher than average ACEs and lower than average substance use, suggesting a subgroup of youth have experienced childhood stressors and trauma and are not self-medicating through illicit substance use. At the same time, the substance use need, female specific, and male specific groups report higher than average rates of substance use. These three moderate risk groups differ in ways that have treatment implications. First, the substance use group reported lower than average ACEs and high risk and low protective factors in the community and peers domain, suggesting that peers and/or situational factors may play a role in their substance use. The female specific group reported higher levels of ACEs, which suggests this group may be self-medicating with substances. Finally, the male specific group reported lower rates of childhood maltreatment but higher rates of a family history of substance use and criminality, suggesting that family may have important influence on their behaviors.",

While many jurisdictions are using risk and need assessment tools, few workers use these tools to inform case management functions and those who do might face constraints due to limited resources and limited programming in the communities they serve. Further, third and fourth generation risk assessment tools include domains to identify needs that predict negative outcomes, particularly recidivism. The design of these instruments assumes that needs are mutually exclusive, and such tools reflected little overlap or convergence among various needs making it difficult to create a taxonomy for services that could ameliorate negative outcomes. This study identified seven distinct groups of youth on probation, providing insight into a myriad of complex needs of youth on probation and disentangling the risk categories into specific needs. We discuss these youth in terms of need rather than risk, to emphasize the opportunity for intervention to offer multidimensional services to these youth to promote positive development and lifetime quality of life.",

These include the fact that all participants came from a single U.S. state, and similar analyses with data from other locations may reveal different groups. For example, in comparison to previous studies, these findings revealed three new groups including two gender-specific groups. Specific artifacts in the data, as well as the indicators researchers use to create the groups, may affect LCA analyses. Moreover, LCA is a descriptive technique, and thus, multiple studies should be considered in tandem with this one. Thus, future research should undertake the same and similar analyses as those we conducted. Still, these findings provide useful insight and have implications for practitioners.",

It showed that youth on probation differ from one another in significant ways, and tailoring of services to their needs will make them more effective. Juvenile justice system intervention should move away from singular interventions focused on a single need and toward multidimensional interventions that recognize the unique needs of individuals. Expanding services offered to youth in this manner may foster positive development among youth preparing to transition to adulthood. Maschi et al. (2008) refer to the juvenile justice system as a \"system of last resort,\" which, to some, may justify emphasizing punishment and narrowly defined opportunities for reform. However, given the size of the juvenile justice system and the overuse of the system for minority youth, it must support positive growth and provide opportunities that will benefit young people. The current research bolsters the claim that using the concepts of systemic responsivity can facilitate changes in the juvenile justice system. .315 * * Indicates statistically significant difference from the expected value at p <.01.

Figures 1 and 2 show the static and dynamic risk indicators, respectively. Moving from Class 1 (lowest need) on the left to Class 7 (complex need) on the right, it is clear that the groups on the left (1 and 2) have lower than average risk factors, the groups in the middle (3-6) have a mix of risk factors, and the group on the right (7) are high in risk factors. Figures 3 and 4 show the static and dynamic protective indicators, respectively. The pattern for protective factors reverses the pattern in the risk factors -the groups on the left (1 and 2) had the highest levels of protective factors, those in the middle (3-6) had a mix, and those on the right (7) had the lowest levels of protective factors. Thus, we see increasing risk and decreasing protective factors as we move from the groups on the left to the groups on the right. These graphs illustrate the heterogeneity of the population regarding static and dynamic risk and protective factors.",

Taxman also indicates that the nature of the services does not meet the needs of individual youth. Sankofa et al. (2016) reviewed juvenile justice treatment services and noted that youth make it clear they know that the treatment programming is designed to \"rehabilitate\" through an emphasis on cognitive-behavioral skills. But the youth also noted that the programming uses a middle class framework that does not acknowledge the structural racism, limited opportunities, or skills they need to survive in their neighborhoods. The youth understand that programming does not reflect their cultural or ethnic backgrounds or their own communities. They perceived interventions as meaningless and punishments as not therapeutic. Such findings may reflect the use of generic interventions that do not reflect individual needs of youth and the clustering of risk-need factors that authorities should be using to define the interventions (Taxman & Caudy, 2015).",

            "text": "Based on the findings in this study, there are service interventions that juvenile justice agencies should consider adding to be responsive to their populations: o For the lowest need youth, diversion or lesson-learning opportunities should be sufficient to ensure that the youth does not penetrate further into the system. This includes community services, restorative justice practices to allow the youth to see how their behavior has affected others, and other efforts to help the youth develop positive relationships; develop self-efficacy through creativity, educational attainment, and employment opportunities; and develop an understanding of the consequences of their behaviors.o The skills need group would likely benefit from skills to learn to navigate difficult times, and in making decisions that advance their engagement in positive behaviors such as work, school, healthy living, creativity, and relationships(Butts, 2017). This group should receive low-intensive control strategies that leverage existing protective factors to prevent future justice involvement.o The mental health need group would likely benefit from mental health services that focus on learning to manage emotions and moods, and regulate behavior, while the substance use need group would likely benefit from substance use services to reduce self-medication and destructive behaviors. Such services might lead these groups to involvement in prosocial activities and further efforts to promote development that do not rely upon medications and encourage youth to learn to express themselves positively.o The female high-need group would benefit from services that focus on identity and self-efficacy. Genderized services can help girls in this group to address the nonoffending behaviors that result in low functionality such as trauma, mental health, and peers. To facilitate change in girls, interventions should emphasize helping them develop an attainable identity to overcome the disregarded self that many girls experience (Goodson & Morash, 2016). Interventions that emphasize a positive and productive identity can help girls in this group to overcome identities of condemnation and self-harm. Identity-based motivation theory recognizes individuals' perceptions of attainable possible selves as the future-oriented component of self-concept, a first step in an adolescent's goal-setting and motivation for action. Current interventions do not focus on developing a prosocial identity; rather they emphasize the importance of taking on mainstream values, opinions, and identity, as Sankofa et al. (2016) note. Girls require specific interventions that will address their particular pathways to delinquent or status behaviors.",
