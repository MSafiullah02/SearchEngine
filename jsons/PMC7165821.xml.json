The concept of One Health seeks to transition from traditional management of individual sectors towards an interdisciplinary approach that addresses zoonotic diseases at the human\u2010animal\u2010environmental interface (Burke et al., 2012; Conrad, Meek, & Dumit, 2013). With 75% of all emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) being traced to animal origin, there are compelling grounds to recognize zoonoses as a central factor in the battle against EIDs (Jeggo & Mackenzie, 2014; Osburn, Scott, & Gibbs, 2009; Taylor, Latham, & Woolhouse, 2001).",

Thus, international efforts have been made to strengthen the integrated surveillance of emerging infectious diseases (Jeggo & Mackenzie, 2014). In 2011, the First International One Health Congress was hosted in Melbourne, Australia, where One Health concepts and principles were developed (Jeggo & Mackenzie, 2014). Also in Australia, the New South Wales health service has achieved enhanced infection control, as well as improved biosecurity procedures, through the implementation of a single reporting system (Adamson, Marich, & Roth, 2011; Uchtmann, Herrmann, Hahn, & Beasley, 2015). While positive steps in achieving integrated One Health surveillance have been undertaken at both national and global levels, it has been suggested that focusing on the challenges to the implementation of One Health in individual countries, with consideration of their cultural and societal elements, could help enable effective national strategies, and therefore, a strengthened international approach to zoonotic disease control (Mackenzie et al., 2014).",

Under the Australian National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), doctors and laboratories are required by law to report certain communicable diseases in humans; however, notifiable diseases differ amongst various jurisdictions (Australian Government Department of Health, 2015; Miller, Roche, Spencer, & Deeble, 2004). Additionally, notifications of animal diseases are collected by a separate government sector and are primarily for the purposes of minimizing adverse impacts on trade (Australian Government Department of Health, 2015). Disease notifications, therefore, vary significantly between human and animal health sectors, and a One Health approach could strengthen inter\u2010sectoral communication and collaboration (Adamson et al., 2011; Australian Government Department of Health, 2016a).

Participants of this study indicate that these differences in definition and perception of meaning likely contribute to a lack of consensus on the scope of the One Health paradigm, which compromises the planning and implementation of any such strategy, preventing collaboration and harmonization. A holistic view of disease epidemiology would dictate that One Health is broader than just zoonotic diseases affecting human and animal health combined, yet the environmental aspect which incorporates potential pathogens in soil, air and water, and diseases that can affect biodiversity, is often overlooked (Casas & Maloy, 2014; Jeggo & Mackenzie, 2014).",

Australia could benefit by adopting an approach to zoonotic disease control that accommodates industry while enhancing zoonotic disease surveillance, managing each issue with consideration of any wider implications. Additionally, looking abroad for examples of successful collaboration may be useful, such as the European Food Safety Authority agency, responsible for animal health and food safety in Europe, who work collaboratively with each sector (Stark et al., 2015). The findings of this study suggest a formal governance body could be established to address emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses in Australia, providing the essential cross\u2010disciplinary communication, information sharing, and bringing together a shared surveillance approach to zoonoses. Based on the participant perspectives of this study, professionals involved in this governance should equally represent human, animal and environmental health, and the policymakers for these areas should be kept informed.",

Additionally, widening the scope of participants to include more stakeholders such as practitioners, policymakers and the representatives from relevant industries would provide a broader depth of understanding and strengthen the validity of the findings. The different interviewing techniques used (a mix of face\u2010to\u2010face and telephone interviews) act as limitations. Further, the study group was homogenous, consisting of academics, and as such the perspectives of participants included in this research are not necessarily representative of those of their peers, practitioners and stakeholders in industry. Despite this, participants branched a wide scope of expertise from varying fields, bringing a multitude of experience to the study.",

While an enhanced understanding of One Health principles has seen public health and animal health authorities, and epidemiologists, work together to address zoonotic disease outbreaks, there remain challenges to the implementation of integrated national surveillance. Broadly, this study illustrates how limited collaboration in tertiary and professional settings results in siloed approaches and mentalities across the sectors and acts as a barrier to the development of an integrated human\u2010animal disease surveillance system. The study findings, in conjunction with relevant literature, suggest for a One Health approach to be successfully implemented in Australia a number of priorities should be addressed. A clear definition and shared vision for the future of One Health should be agreed upon, and cross\u2010disciplinary tertiary training could help broaden knowledge of One Health to young professionals. A formal governance body should be established with the involvement of relevant policymakers. Interdisciplinary communication about zoonoses and the collaboration of relevant sectors are crucial in addressing the prevention of emerging zoonotic diseases in Australia and abroad.",
