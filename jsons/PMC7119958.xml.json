            "text": "\nEvery living cell has to exchange molecules across the membrane for cellular functions. The hydrophobic or lipophilic molecules do not require energy for crossing the membrane. They can diffuse freely from higher to lower concentration till equilibrium is established. This process is called passive transport or diffusion. This is not true for polar or lipophobic molecules because of the nonpolar nature of membrane lipid bilayer. For polar molecules, the cell recruits mediator or transporter proteins in the membrane to facilitate their movement. If the direction of transport is from higher to lower concentration region, the transporter proteins do not use external energy and the process is called facilitated transport, because the energy needed for transport is dispensed by molecule\u2019s own concentration gradient (unequal distribution across the membrane) in the favorable direction. The free energy is minimal in unequal distribution of polar molecules. If polar molecule is transported from lower to higher concentration region, against the concentration gradient, the energy has to be provided by external source to mediator protein to make the process spontaneous in the cell, and this process is called active transport. In the cell, the energy source is mostly adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The facilitated transport unlike diffusion has shown speed and specificity, saturation kinetics, susceptibility to competitive inhibition, and susceptibility to chemical inactivation. The active transport of polar molecules against concentration gradient requires energy for transport. A large group of transporters that hydrolyze ATP to transport molecules across the membrane are known as ATPases. These carrier ATPases are classified into five subclasses according to their structure and physiological functions as P-type ATPases, V-type ATPases, F-type ATPases, ecto-type ATPases, and A-type ATPases. P-type ATPase transporters are multidomain integral membrane proteins involved in the transport of cation and lipids. Phylogenetically according to their function, these P-type ATPases are divided into five major types and various subclasses. The vacuolar ATPases are ATP-dependent oligomeric protein proton pump, which regulate acidic pH in organelle compartment like phagosome and endosome for the separation of ligand from their receptors transport proton (H+) across the plasma membrane. The secondary transport, also known as ion-coupled transport involves the use of electrochemical potential generated by an ion transport for the co-transport of another ion against the gradient across the membrane. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, importers, and exporters, the newly identified integral proteins, comprise a large superfamily of integral membrane proteins with diverse functions. There are three major transporters which are known as flippases, floppases, and scramblases. The flippases are also known as P4-ATPases, which transport phospholipids to inner leaflet of membrane and have substrate specificity to phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl choline. Aquaporins (AQPs), the integral proteins of membrane, are small, hydrophobic, and homotetramer proteins, which are involved in bidirectional transport. The bacteria take nutrients from their surroundings by various modes of transport but the transport of sugars and its derivatives like sugar alcohols, amino sugars, glucuronic acids, and disaccharides is transported by group translocation with histidine heat resistance protein HPr as high-energy phosphate donor protein. The transporting sugar molecule is also phosphorylated during transport, which makes sugar negatively charged. The various organisms have specialized proteins of rhodopsin family to seize light energy for various physiological functions. The rhodopsin protein part, opsin, is covalently linked to retinal chromophore, which may be in trans- or cis-configuration. The animal rhodopsin (also known as Type II) are cell G-coupled receptors, while microbial rhodopsin (Type I) may act as ion pump, ion channels, sensors, photosensory receptors and regulator for gene expression and kinases. Pore-forming toxins (PFTs), the bacterial virulence factor, single major family of proteins, are secreted by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. PFTs may be present either in cytoplasm or in the membrane. The conformational change in cytoplasmic PFTs may translocate them to membrane in need of hour. Ionophores are natural and synthetic organic molecules of diverse type, which can transport cations by forming lipid ion-soluble complex. Each ionophore possesses a unique property of changing transmembrane ion gradient and electrical potential, synthesized by bacteria, and acts as protector against competing microbes. The bacterial and eukaryotic membranes are found to have special proteins in their outer membrane for transport, which are known as porins and form channels for various small size solutes, ions, and other nutrients. The protein ion channels are passive transporters, are made up of transmembrane, are selective for their substrate ions, and have much faster rate of transport than pumps. These channel proteins do not interact with transporting ions and have two conformations, closed and open, to regulate flow of ions. The trimeric ATP-activated channels are permeable to cations like sodium, potassium, and calcium. There are seven subclasses of the group, which are involved in various physiological functions like muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release and immune responses regulation. The GABA and glycine receptors are anion channels but inhibitory in nature. GABA receptors have two subdivisions as GABA receptors family of ligand-gated channel (ionotropic) GABAA and G receptor protein family (GABAB). The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are known as glutamate-gated cation channel for calcium permeation. The tetrameric ionotropic receptors include NMDA, \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and kainate receptor as per their synthetic ligand binding. The voltage-gated ion channels open or close in response to change in voltage and the unit of membrane potential. In excitable cells like nerve and muscle, the chemical or electrical signaling is initiated through voltage-dependent sodium or calcium influx. The K2P channels or voltage insensitive channels formerly referred to as\ufeff leaky or resting channels, are ubiquitously found in all organisms. The functionally active K2P channel has two subunits, and each subunit is made up of two pore regions (P1 and P2), four transmembrane domains (M1\u2013M4), and two characteristic extracellular helices Cap C1 and C2. This chapter explains all the mechanisms of membrane transport.",

The diffusion of particle across the membrane is determined by Fick\u2019s law of diffusion and affected by magnitude of concentration gradient, molecular weight of solute, distance, permeability, and surface area of membrane. The diffusion coefficient of any solute molecule of Fick\u2019s law is proportionality factor, which can be defined as mass of solute diffusing through a unit area in a unit time (unit is square meter per second). The diffusion coefficient depends on the size, temperature, charge on the molecule because of difference between proton and electron and polarity (uneven distribution of charge in the molecule) (Fig. 6.1).\n",

The glucose transporter proteins are divided into two major families like Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLTs) and facilitative glucose transporter (GLUTs). The SGLT is found in specialized epithelial cells of intestine, proximal tubule of kidney, trachea, heart, brain, testis, and prostate. The Na+/glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) are involved in secondary transport of glucose in intestine and nephrons. The 12 members of SGLT class are identified; out of them SGLT1, SGLT2, SGLT4, and SGLT5 function as sugar transporter and SGLT3 acts as glucose sensor. SGLT2 is present in the kidney, brain, liver, thyroid, muscle, and heart. The facilitative glucose transporter (GLUTs) has 14 members, and 11 out of 14 transport sugars. GLUT1 is present in erythrocytes, fetus placenta, brain, and kidney but low in liver and muscles. GLUT2 expressed in liver maintains glucose homeostasis. GLUT3 is neuron-specific glucose transporter with Km of around 2 mM for glucose. GLUT4, a high-affinity, insulin-responsive transporter with approximately 5 mM K\nm, is expressed in adipose tissue and muscle tissue. In the process of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, the various proteins of signal pathway also participate. The high-affinity enzyme GLUT1 has Km for glucose around 3\u20137 mM lower than blood glucose level (5\u20137 mM), hence transports glucose at significant level \ufeffeven in hypoglycemic conditio\ufeffns.

The various cations may be H+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Zn2+, Ni, and Pb2+. The phylogenetic study has divided this group into five major types and more than 11 subtypes.\nE-type ATPases: These are cell surface transporters involved in extracellular transport, which can use nucleoside diphosphates and nucleosides triphosphates including extracellular ATP. These transporters depend upon Ca2+ and Mg2+ and are insensitive to specific inhibitor of P-type. Examples are ecto-ATPase and animal ecto-apyrase. The E-type ATPases participate in termination of purinergic receptor-mediated responses. They are also involved in cell adhesion processes and are important for the maintenance of hemostasis in the cardio vasculature.\nF-type ATPases (F\n1\n\u2013F\n0\nATPases): These ATPases are involved in ATP synthesis and localized on bacterial membrane, thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, and inner membranes of mitochondria.\n",

The cycle starts with loading of ion 1 (X+) to high-affinity binding site and releasing of extracellular ion 2 (Y+) in cytoplasm through cytoplasmic access channel. The interaction of ion 1 (X+) with polar group of amino acids near binding site at P-domain twists M4, M1, and M6 helices to move in E1 state.

Simultaneously, M1, M2, and M3 helices of A-domain because of their rearrangement induced by phosphorylation may close polar ion access channel from cytoplasmic site. This might be understood that the inclination of P-domain induces the movement of helices in such a way that E2~P state has low affinity to ion1 (X+) and leaves this to extracellular site or into lumen of ER. The E2~P state has high affinity for ion 2 (Y+), and binding to this ion may induce the hydrolysis of phosphorylated aspartic acid. The TGE loop interaction with Mg2+ ion will leave phosphate group unprotected, and this may result in hydrolysis by water. After this hydrolysis, E2 transforms into E2 state with open binding site in cytoplasm for next cycle of transport.",

Glutamate uptake in presynaptic vesicle is found to be dependent on V-type ATPases. The V-type ATPases regulate plasma pH by exporting proton through renal intercalated cells of kidney. The mutation in V-type ATPases may cause renal tubular acidosis. The vacuolar ATPases also regulates acidic pH in osteoclasts for bone degradation, and the genetic defect in V-type ATPases may cause osteoporosis.

This alternate conformation of transporter (involved helices II, IV, V in N-terminal and VII, X, XI in C-terminal) exposes bound sugar and proton to cytosol and periplasmic side alternatively; the basic principle of this type secondary transport is the conformation change in transporter by binding with substrate. The sugar-interacting residues are present in N-terminal region and the proton-interacting amino acids are present in C-terminal side (Fig. 6.15).\n",

In the absence of sugar, lactose permease transporter is closed from periplasmic side. The binding of d-galactosyl pyranoside to LacY transporter induces changes in protein to open periplasmic side by closing cytosolic inward open cavity. The deprotonation of E325 causes closing of inward cavity and opening of periplasmic cavity. The membrane potential has no effect on substrate binding. The five residues R144, W151, E269, N272, and H322 bind directly to substrate. The E126 and Y236 stabilize R144 and H322. All these together form substrate binding site in the center of protein. The translocation of substrate may be induced by hydrophobic interaction of W151 indole ring and d-galactosyl pyranoside ring. The binding of this nonpolar substrate to transporter induces major rearrangement of helices in the vicinity of substrate binding site for perfect accommodation. The substrate binding may lower down activation energy for transition between inward open and outward open conformation of LacY. In LacY, the galactose binding induces major conformational change in N-terminal six helices bundle (Fig. 6.16).\n",

The NBD forms catalytic domain with Walker A or P-loop, Walker B, Q-loop and H motif (switch region) and conserved sequence LSGGQ in alpha-helical region. The relative orientation of catalytic sequence to alpha-helical region is decided by ATP binding. Usually, in active ABC transporters, its subunits are arranged in head to tail in opposite direction to each other. TMD1 and TMD2 heterogeneous helices are further divided into three separate fold as Type ABC transporter, Type II ABC transporter, and ABC exporters\u2019 folds. In outward positions, the TMD helices are in extended wing because of TM1 and TM2 from one subunit and TM3 and TM6 from other subunit. TMD primarily interacts with variable Q-loop with conserved glutamine in \u03b1-helical domain. Any change in Q-loop is directly coupled to ATP hydrolysis and conformation change of TMD. Walker B-loop participates in binding. Magnesium interaction with ATP requires D502 of Walker B. ABC transporters utilize two ATPs per one molecule of substrate transport. In addition to substrate binding, two sets of amino acids of D-, Q-, and H-loops are required for catalysis. One set acts as general base to activate water molecule to attack on \u03b3-phosphate group of ATP, and other set of amino acids stabilizes phosphate oxygen. The amino acid E502 near Walker B, Q422 of Q-loop and H534 in H motif essentially contributes to catalysis. ATP molecule is bound at interface between TMD and NBD, and terminal \u03b3-phosphate is positioned between P-loop and LSGGQ signature sequence. The most important factor in catalysis is the relative position between NBD and TMD domain because of ATP, ADP, and substrate binding.

It transports alkaline and alkali metals across the cell membrane. Beauvericin, found in Beauveria bassiana, wheat, barley, and corn, causes apoptosis in mammals additionally. The other class of enniatins ionophores are found in fusarium fungi. Usually, proteins have the characteristic of forming channels in the membrane for transport of various molecules, but some of the ionophore also transport by forming a channel in the membrane. These ionophores have a few unusual amino acids normally not found in proteins. Gramicidin, isolated from Bacillus brevis, has 15 amino acids, linearly arranged in D and L alternate fashion with amino-terminal formaldehyde and carboxyl terminal ethanol amine. The hydrophobic amino acids in gramicidin support its function in channel formation. These channels have outer lining of hydrophobic amino acids to interact with lipid bilayer of membrane with hydrophilic interior for ion interaction. These channels allow very fast diffusion of ions through them in very short period unlike carrier ions. Their size is larger than protein channel. Gramicidin channels allow protons and other cation movements but not of divalent cations like Ca\n2, which block them. Gramicidin has antibiotic property against gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and pathogenic fungi but sometimes its hemolytic activity may limit its use. In various solvents, gramicidin has stable amphiphilic antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure with a polar and a nonpolar surface as \u03b1-helix is not possible because of alternate d- and l-amino acid residues. Gramicidin has 6.3 residues per turn in \u03b2-sheet structure with channel diameter approximately 0.4 nm. The ethanol residue is projected on the surface and formyl group inserted in membrane. The nonpolar amino acids play a role in microbial specificity, and disrupted beta-sheet structure adds to its antimicrobial activity (Fig. 6.42).\n",

Two separate ligands are required for NMDA receptors activation. The ligand binding domain of subunit has two subdomains S1 and S2. The S1 domain of two neighboring subunits, at their interface, creates ligand binding site and is rigid in structure but lower one S2 domain is mobile without any interaction. In typical NDMA receptor, GluN1 and GluN2 will interact with two molecules of glutamate and two molecules of glycine. The receptor with Glu N1 and Glu N3 will require only glycine for the activation. The NMDA receptors have high affinity to glutamate, high calcium (Ca2+) permeability, which may be blocked by magnesium ion in voltage-dependent manner. The NMDA differs from AMPA receptor of the same family in its function. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors unlike \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA, activation time 2 ms) are slow in activation (app. 10\u201350 ms) and deactivation (app. 50\u2013500 ms). AMPA receptor initiates rapid polarization in response to neurotransmitter release during synaptic transmission but NMDA receptors only care for time span of synaptic currents. The glycine is coagonist for NMDA receptor. Two molecules of glycine and two molecules of glutamate bind on separate binding site in receptor for the activation and opening of channel, which results in influx of calcium and sodium with efflux of potassium. The electrical synapses are converted into chemical synapses through NMDA receptor because influx of calcium in postsynaptic membrane activates calcium-dependent signaling pathway for the modulation of synaptic structure, plasticity, and connectivity.",

The closing of channel may result in glutamic acid release and desensitization of receptors. It has been observed that the NMDA receptors may be in desensitized form with bound glutamate for long period. The other function of NMDA receptor in learning and memory can be inhibited by magnesium ion in voltage-dependent mode. In close state of receptor, the magnesium is bound to receptor in inhibition mode, which can be released only by sufficient depolarization of the membrane. This kind of interaction empowers NMDA receptor to act as coincidence detector for pre- and postsynaptic changes. The slow kinetics of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) supports temporal summation and decreases dendritic filtering of synaptic input. The receptors provide strength to synapses through long-term potentiation (LTP) and weakness by long-term depression (LTD) for learning and memory. Through calcium influx, the overstimulation of NMDA receptors may cause Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Physiologically, NMDA receptors may be desensitized by unfavorable interaction between glycine and glutamate to cause close conformation of receptor or calcium influx activate calmodulin to remove actin 2 from receptor to keep receptor in desensitized mode.

The sodium channel protein in human is composed of large \u03b1-subunits (260 Kd with 2000 amino acids) and small \u03b2-subunits (30\u201340 Kd); the small \u03b2-subunit has two isoforms \u03b2-1 and \u03b2-2. The sodium channel \u03b2-subunits have N-terminal extracellular domain into immunoglobulin-like fold, a single transmembrane segment, and a short intracellular segment. These units may form heterodimer or heterotrimer. The \u03b1-subunits are linked noncovalently to \u03b2-1 and through disulfide linkage to \u03b2-2. The voltage-gated sodium ion channels are also known as NaV channels. In human, \u03b1-subunit has various isoforms like Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.4, Nav1.5, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9. The Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 are found in peripheral nervous system and Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 in central nervous system, and the Nav1.5 resides in heart muscle and Nav1.4 in skeletal muscle. The \u03b1-subunit is coded by ten different genes in human but one of these codes for nonchannel \u03b1-protein is known as sensing helix. \u03b2-subunits have four isoforms as \u03b2-1, \u03b2-2, \u03b2-3, and \u03b2-4. The \u03b2-1 and \u03b2-3 associate with \u03b1-subunit noncovalently and \u03b2-2 and \u03b2-4 through disulfide linkage. Nav\u03b2-subunits resemble cell adhesion molecules in structure and may have role in localization. The three-dimensional structure of voltage-gated sodium channel has revealed structural detail, mechanism and catalytic amino acids involved, drug target site, and regulatory site. The bacterial sodium channel (NavAb) is seen to have central pore surrounded by four pore-forming helix segments S5 and S6 segments and the intervening pore loop. The four voltage-sensing elements made up of S1\u2013S4 segments are symmetrically associated with the peripheral pore elements.",

The lateral cavity, occupied with the hydrophobic tails of membrane phospholipids, may be important in channel gating because of lipid interaction with M2 and M4 domains and alkyl chains of membrane lipids into the cavity through the lateral opening influences the conductance and the pharmacological properties. Like all voltage-dependent channels, the glycine residues are conserved M2 and the M4 helices of all K2P-channels for creating kink in M2 and the M4 domain around the hinge of G268 for moving M4-helix from a \u201cdown\u201d to an \u201cup\u201d configuration for transport, where lateral fenestration is closed and ions are passed through the selectivity filter. In down conformation, the central cavity M4-helix crosses the membrane in such a way that lipids of the central cavity blocks the permeation. K2P-channels are lined up with hydrophobic residues in layer. The opening of lower activation gate promotes the opening of upper inactivation gate, and C-type inactivation is promoted unlike voltage-dependent gate. During depolarization, all K2P-channels have shown immediate current component and following time-dependent component of outward current. This instantaneous component supports all K2P channels to have open probability at negative potentials, and the time-dependent current changes support the regulation of K2P-channels by voltage changes. The steady-state current\u2013voltage relation under physiological conditions (with 4\u20135 mM K+ extracellular concentration) of K2P channel, studied at depolarized potentials, is much larger than the current flowing through K2P channel at resting membrane potential to support role of K2P channel in action potential configuration.

In various tissues, K2P channels are present to perform various functions and may also play role in apoptosis subjected to further analysis (Figs. 6.55 and 6.56).\n\n",
