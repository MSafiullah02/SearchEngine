            "text": "Lentiviruses such as HIV have a daunting challenge in gaining access to a new host predominantly through the barriers of penile, rectal, or vaginal/cervical mucosal tissue after sexual exposure. Multiple mechanisms have evolved to help prevent such infections, including anatomical barriers, innate inhibitors, and adaptive immune responses. For lentiviruses, it appears that in naive or even conventionally vaccinated hosts, typical adaptive immune responses are generally too little and too late to prevent infection (Keele and Estes 2011). The healthy mucous membranes The V1/V2 domain of HIV-1 gp120 mediates binding to integrin \u03b14\u03b27 (\u03b14\u03b27) on CD4+T-cells (Arthos et al. 2008). \u03b14\u03b27 has been termed the gut homing integrin (Wagner et al. 1996). It is upregulated on lymphocytes in Peyer\u2019s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, and then mediate, with chemokine receptors, the homing of these lymphocytes into gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) through interactions with its natural ligands, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), which appear on the gut endothelial cells (Bargatze et al. 1995). N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs) of V1, V2 and V4 domains of viral gp120 remain unglycosylated and surprisingly potentiate the affinity for \u03b14\u03b27 integrin. Therefore only a very small proportion if infecting HIV-1 (A or C subtypes) will be able to infect the mucosal lymphocytes unless an other sexually transmitted infection had not attracted and activated the CD4+ cells in the mucosa of the genital barriers (Nawaz et al. 2011).",

The secretory IgA and IgM impair or inhibit surface colonisation of microorganisms and dampen penetration of potentially dangerous antigens. The cellular part of OT mainly depends on the development of regulatory T (TREG) cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to which mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) carry exogenous antigens and become conditioned for induction of TREG cells (Brandtzaeg 2010). Tolerance to these antigens may also protect self-proteins that show immunological similarity to the intestinal normal flora. It has been suggested recently, that antigenic mimicry is one of the mechanisms contributing to the extension of OT to intestinal bacteria (bacterial homunkulus) on the basis of similar mimotopes (Krist\u00f3f et al. 2009).

It has been shown that human IgE also could facilitate transepithelial antigen sampling. CD23 was expressed constitutively on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and food-allergic patients had increased levels of soluble CD23 and food-specific IgE in the stool after challenge. Specific IgE facilitated the uptake of antigen from the apical surface of an epithelial monolayer by rescuing antigen from landing into lysosomes. CD23a functions as a bidirectional transporter of IgE and can capture IgE\u2013antigen complexes and deliver them in an immunologically intact form across the intestinal epithelial barrier (Li et al. 2006a, b).",

However, it is unknown whether T cells are also educated to be tolerant of foreign antigens, such as those from commensal bacteria, to prevent immunopathology such as inflammatory bowel disease. It has been shown that the contact with commensal microbiota results in the peripheral generation of T\nREG\ncells rather than pathogenic effectors. It has been observed that colonic TREG cells used T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) different from those used by TREG cells in other locations, implying an important role for local antigens in shaping the colonic TREG-cell population. Many of the local antigens seemed to be derived from commensal bacteria, on the basis of the in vitro reactivity of common colon TREG TCRs. These TCRs did not facilitate thymic TREG-cell development, implying that many colonic TREG cells arise instead by means of antigen-driven peripheral TREG-cell development. Microbiota indigenous to the mouse colony examined was required for the generation of colonic TREG cells from otherwise naive T cells.

The site of barrier function is at the level of the endothelium, astrocytes are known to induce and maintain permeability properties of the BBB. Another potential role of astrocytes is in the actual regulation of water transport across the BBB, mainly because of the highly polarized localization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the perivascular endfeet of astrocytes (Quick and Cipolla 2005). During the telencephalon morphogenesis the immature astroglia cells play a role in the early establishment of the distribution pattern of the neural microvessels and in their growth and maturation. Astrocytes are well known to establish close anatomical and functional relationships with the adult brain microvessels and to induce the expression and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) phenotype of the brain endothelial cells (Virgintino et al. 1998). One pathologic condition that may involve AQP4 and edema formation is eclampsia. Eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy due to its neurological complications, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, and seizures (Mas and Lamy 1998). Eclampsia seems to be similar to hypertensive encephalopathy in which an acute rise in blood pressure causes forced dilation of the cerebral arteries and arterioles, decreased cerebrovascular resistance, and increased pressure on the microcirculation, resulting in disruption of the BBB and vasogenic edema (Engelter et al. 2000).",

Herpes simplex virus 1 and varicella-zoster virus encephalitides were followed by acute retinal necrosis after some delay. The delay, however may last sometimes for decates (Klein and Lefebvre 2007; Vandercam et al. 2008). The way of HSV-1 to retinal cell layers were mediated by nectin-1 receptor being the major determinant of HHSV-1 entry into retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. In addition, nectin-1 can influence cell to-cell spread of the virions involving membrane fusion. This is probably the mechanism helping the virus to enter the inner eye (Tiwari et al. 2008). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) produced in epithelial cells preferentially fuses with the plasma membrane of retinal pigmented epithelial cells, whereas fibroblast-derived virus mostly enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Wang et al. 2007). Human cytomegalovirus retinitis of patients suffering from HIV-1 disease occurs frequently, too (Geng et al. 2011). Eyes of AIDS patients with a clinical history of HCMV retinitis were tested positive for HCMV, but also for JC papillomavirus and HIV-1 provirus (Eberwein et al. 2005). Multifocal choroiditis is the most common ocular manifestation associated with West-Nile Virus (WNV) infection, with a typically benign clinical course. Less frequent ocular lesions, including optic neuritis and occlusive vasculitis, frequently induce persistent and likely permanent visual deficit (Chan et al. 2006).",

The syncytiotrophoblast expresses no MHC antigens on its surface, which is consistent with the concept that the placenta is immunologically neutral. Indeed, it has been difficult to demonstrate any systemic maternal T- or B-cell responses to trophoblast cells (as opposed to fetal cells that cross into the maternal circulation) during human pregnancy. The outermost layer of the human placenta is devoid of classical class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II proteins (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP). Although this prevents recognition by maternal T lymphocytes, the lack of class I molecules leaves these cells susceptible to attack by natural killer (NK) cells.

In contrast to cancer cells trophoblasts follow an organized pattern of differentiation from proliferation to invasion without distant metastasis (Marco et al. 2009). To promote invasion the epithelial trophoblasts differentiate and mesenchymal transition occurs, which results in loss of cell-to-cell contact inhibition and the loss of cell polarity. Cells secrete proteases required for the spread in the decidua.

HLA-E, -F, and -G, have restricted expression, few variants, and appear rarely to be immunostimulatory (Carosella et al. 2003). One class Ia antigen, HLA-C, and the three class Ib antigens are differentially expressed by trophoblast cell subpopulations. HLA-G5 and HLA-G6 are the soluble isoforms of the antigen (Sargent et al. 2006). HLA-G5 is a homodimer without \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m). The results suggest that the \u03b22m-free structure has selective functional advantages for trophoblast cells, perhaps in evading immune recognition (Apps et al. 2007; Kuroki and Maenaka 2007; Morales et al. 2007). The cell migration from the fetus to the mother is a well known phenomenon during pregnancy (Dawe et al. 2007). It is hypothesised, that the HLA-G allels on the surface of the fetal cells might play a role in the long term survival of microchimeric cells in the maternal organisms.",

In a tissue culture system the overexpression of miR-152 reduced the expression of HLA-G therefore the cells of cytotrophoblast origin became less resistant to NK-cell lysis (Zhu et al. 2010). The ras-responsive element 1 (RREB-1) was shown to bind to the promoter of HLA-G being probably a repressor of the gene. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-carrier cells and HIV-1 infection can derepress the HLA-G expression (Flajollet et al. 2009; Moreau et al. 2009; Donadi et al. 2011). HLA G1-G2, and G5-7 allels are expressed in myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells present in the cord-blood circulation (Rom\u00e1n et al. 2009). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G has direct inhibitory effects on natural killer cells (NK), dendritic cells (DC), T cells and can induce tolerant regulatory cells. The expression of HLA-G has been correlated with the tolerance of the fetus, the acceptance of organ transplants, and the immune escape of tumor cells of virus-infected cells.",

Mature peripheral blood CD16+ NK cells can be transformed into CD16\u2212 CD9+ NK cells with a decidual phenotype after prolonged exposure to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2). Recently it has been discovered, that similar change of NK-cell population occurs, when the patients are suffering from metastatic melanoma (Holtan et al. 2011). A specific immune population namely uterine natural killer (uNK) cells has been shown to promote placentation and thus the establishment of a successful pregnancy through the production of cytokines, chemokines and angiogenic factors. The fetal portion of the placenta is comprised, in part, of trophoblast cells. In humans, fetal extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells invade the uterus and the uterine spiral arteries and are thus in close proximity to maternal immune cells. EVT cells were shown to express class Ia HLA-C, too. Syncytiotrophoblast cells, which cover the chorionic villi have direct contact with maternal blood (Riley 2008; Riley and Yokoyama 2008). Trophoblasts are of fetal origin, i.e. semi-allogeneic because of the paternal genes and these have to escape the effects of the maternal immune system.",

CD28, a receptor for B7H1 and B7H2, is constitutively expressed on naive T cells, but ICOS is only up-regulated following T-cell receptor engagement and T-cell activation, and its expression in the peripheral blood is restricted to effector/memory T cells. In vitro stimulation by either ICOS or CD28 ligation promotes the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (Th1), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 (Th2) and IL-17 (Th17), but IL-2 release is only increased after CD28 ligation. On the other hand a critical role has been described for ICOS, but not for CD28 in IL-10 production, what is extremely important for the establishment of immunotolerance. Furthermore ICOS was consistently expressed at greater levels on the surface of CD4+ and CD8+ decidual T cells when compared with peripheral T cells. ICOS was found to be strongly expressed on decidual TREG cells. TREG cells accumulate in the uterine decidua at a much higher density than that seen in the peripheral blood. The ICOS ligand, B7H2, was expressed on extra villous trophoblasts (EVTs) in the basal plate of term placentas. The ICOS-B7H2 pathway was suggested to play a role in antiviral defence. A subset of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells can recognize peptides derived from pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus, that are bound to HLA-E molecules. The binding of B7H2 on EVTs to ICOS on decidual T cells may cooperate with antigen presentation by trophoblast-expressed HLA-E to promote Tcell activities that prevent uteroplacental infection (Nagamatsu et al. 2011).",

A Th1/Th2 ratio increase has been linked to early pregnancy failure. Recently, CD4+CD25brightFoxp3+ regulatory TREG cells were recognized to play a crucial role in the maintenance of normal immune tolerance. These TREG cells may also contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy. The emerging concept of the Th17/TREG balance has challenged the conventional paradigm of Th1/Th2 hypothesis. CD4+ interleukin (IL)-17A+ T (Th17) cells and CD4+CD25brightFoxp3+ regulatory T (TREG) cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry; IL-17 concentrations in cell culture supernates were quantitatively determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbtion assay; and IL-17A positive cells in decidua tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry (Bettelli et al. 2006; Schumacher et al. 2007). Low serum interleukin 17 concentration was found to be associated with preterm birth (Hee et al. 2011). Human gammadelta T cells expressing the V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cell-receptors (TCR) play important roles in immune responses to microbial pathogens by monitoring prenyl pyrophosphate isoprenoid metabolites. Most adult V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells are memory cytotoxic cells that produce IFN-gamma. Recently, murine gammadelta T cells were found to be major sources of IL-17A in antimicrobial and autoimmune responses. IL-17A and IL-22 production by V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells were characterised, too. IL-17A-producing memory V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells exist at low but significant frequencies in adult humans (1:2762 T cells). V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells produce IL-22 (1:1864 T cells), although few produce both IL-17A and IL-22. Many IL-17A + V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells of adult humans also produce IFN-gamma (Tgammadelta1/17). Human neonatal V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells stimulated with the bacterial Ag, (\u03b5)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate, and various cytokines and mAbs in vitro resulted that IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TGF-\u03b2 are required to generate Tgammadelta17 cells in neonates, whereas Tgammadelta1/17 cells additionally required IL-23. In adults, memory Tgammadelta1/17 and Tgammadelta17 cells required IL-23, IL-1\u03b2, and TGF-\u03b2, but not IL-6. IL-22-producing cells showed similar requirements. Both neonatal and adult IL-17A V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells expressed elevated levels of retinoid-related orphan receptor \u03b3-T. These data suggested that, like Th17 alphabeta T cells, V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells can be polarized into Tgammadelta17 and Tgammadelta1/17 populations with distinct cytokine requirements for their initial polarization and later maintenance (Ness-Schwickerath et al. 2010).",

The number of TREG cells decreases in several autoimmune diseases, and adoptive transfer of purified TREG cells improves the autoimmune disorders (Crispin et al. 2003; Tang et al. 2004). Meanwhile, several studies have reported that TREG frequencies in circulation increase during normal early pregnancy, peaking during the second trimester and then declining postpartum, and decrease in women with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion URSA (Yang et al. 2008a). It has been suggested that the enrichment of CD4+CD25+TREG in decidua may explain the local mechanisms of immunological tolerance and play a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. TREG cells exert their function partly by secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 (Zheng et al. 2004; Awasthi et al. 2007). Additionally, TGF-\u03b21 can promote Foxp3 expression by inducing TREG differentiation from CD4+ CD25\u2212 T cells.",

IL-17F regulates proinflammatory gene expression in vitro, and this requires IL-17 receptor A, tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated factor 6, and Act1.

The vitamin A metabolites, including retinoic acid (RA), form ligands for retinoic acid-related nuclear receptors and together they play pleiotropic roles in various biological processes. RA also functions as a key modulator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-driven immune deviation, capable of suppressing the differentiation of interleukin-17 secreting T helper cells (TH17) and conversely promoting the generation of Foxp3+ T regulatory (TREG) cells. The role of RA in the reciprocal TGF-beta-driven differentiation of TH17 and TREG is important also in the control a functional immune system, in particular at the mucosal interface of the intestine (Mucida et al. 2007, 2009).",

SV-40 polyomavirus was seen to replicate in extravillous trophoblasts and the inhibition of metalloproteinase expression impaired invasive potential of the cells (Logan et al. 1996). BK polyomavirus can infect several fetal organs, but was not found to be responsible for abortions (Boldorini et al. 2010). It has been revealed, that the herpes simplex type 1 and HCMV infection influence the expression of HLA-A and B antigens, but the expression of HLA-C and -G in the infected trophoblast cells decreases (Schust et al. 1999). Exacerbation of herpes simplex virus infection during pregnancy is associated with damage to syncytiotrophoblast inflicted by herpesvirus either directly or via TNF-\u03b1 (due to contact of NK lymphocytes with villus surface). A sharp decrease in the content of heat shock protein with a molecular weight of 70 kDa and activation of caspase-3 were noted in placenta homogenates. This may lead to disturbances in syncytiotrophoblast cytosol structure and increase the relative content of apoptotic nuclei (Lutsenko et al. 2010). Human cytomegalovirus HCMV can infect villus trophoblasts in vitro and cause the decrease of early pregnancy villous EVT\u2019s invasive function (Tao et al. 2011). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is highly expressed in the placenta and is known to prevent maternal immune rejection. HCMV infection inhibited IDO activity in the early placenta. IFN-\u03b3-induced IDO activity was suppressed by HCMV in both early and term placenta. Early placental dysfunction through the inhibition of IDO activity may reveal a possible mechanism for miscarriages (Lopez et al. 2011). Epstei-Barr virus (EBV) can replicate ex vivo in syncytiotrophoblast cells (T\u00f3th et al. 1997). HCMV, HHSV, HHV-6, and-7 and B-19 parvovirus were found in samples taken from abortions or unexplained fetal death in utero (Al-Buhtori et al. 2011). Hepattis B virus (HBV) can replicate in trophoblast cells ex vivo (Zhang et al. 2011). The presence of adeno-associated Dependovirus (AAV) in decidual or trophoblastic cells in cases of abortion implies that the virus could have causal association and abortion. The occurrence of AAV was found to be much higher the case of abortions than in the saples taken from intentional abortions (Pereira et al. 2010). Human bocavirus (HBoV) seropositivity was found to be very frequent in pregnants, but this virus was not shown to harm the offspring (Enders et al. 2009). The globosid receptor for human parvovirus B-19 was found to be expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells (Wegner and Jordan 2004). B-19 parvovirus was also found in samples taken from abortions or unexplained fetal death in utero (Al-Buhtori et al. 2011). Human endogenous retrovirus W (HERV-W) was expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells, and the envelope proteins (syncytin 1 and 2) induce the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells (Malden et al. 2000; Mi et al. 2000; Blaise et al. 2005; Noorali et al. 2009; Vargas et al. 2009). Ex vivo, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA and a latent viral antigen were detected in placental samples from HHV-8-seropositive women. These findings demonstrate that HHV-8, like other human herpesviruses, may infect placental cells in vitro and in vivo (Di Stefano et al. 2008). Vertical transmission may occur through CD4+ endothelial tissues or CD4+ fetal Hofbauer cells. Trophoblasts and floating villi have CD4-receptors, which make them potential candidates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Placental cytokines and chemokines influence HIV replication in trophoblasts. Genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences verify the interaction of HIV-1 and placental tissue. The vertical transmission of HIV-1 characterized by selection of genotype variant that escape the mother\u2019s immune system (Vidricaire and Tremblay 2007; Al-Husaini 2009). Interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 were shown to potentiate HIV-1 replication in explants of syncytiotrophoblasts (B\u00e1csi et al. 2001). HIV-infected women display different immunologic profiles from HIV-negative women, which may have importance for the induction of fetal-maternal tolerance and in part explain the increased risk of abortion in HIV-infected women (Kolte et al. 2011). The presence of papillomaviruses in the cord blood shows, that these are also able to pass the maternal-fetal barrier (Hermonat et al. 1998; Younes et al. 2007, 2009; You et al. 2008; Sarkola et al. 2008). The Hungarian Case-control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities dataset (1980\u20131996) comprises records of 22,843 neonates with different specified congenital abnormalities, and 38,151 matched controls without defects. A total of 17 (0.07%) mothers of neonates with abnormalities and 25 (0.07%) mothers of neonates without defects were affected by genital warts during the study pregnancy indicating that papillomaviruses do not play a role in the development of fetal abnormalities (B\u00e1nhidy et al. 2010). West Nile virus was also able to multiply in trophoblast cells (Julander et al. 2006). Human T-cell leukemiavirus (HTLV-1 and HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 6 (Csoma et al. 2002). Coxsackieviruses can replicate in trophoblast cells, too (Euscher et al. 2001). Measles virus was shown to replicate in the placenta in twins of unvaccinated mothers (Ohyama et al. 2001). The different subgenera of rubellavirus were suggested to affect the fetuses i.e. the most isolates in France belonged to subgenus \u201cE\u201d (Vauloup-Fellous et al. 2010). Death of the mother and fetus, abortion, premature delivery, or death of a live-born baby soon after birth are common complications of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection during pregnancy (Smith 2001). Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) is causing frequently abortions (Ikegami and Makino 2011).",
