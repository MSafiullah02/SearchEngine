Transpl Infect Dis 2014: 16: 359-368. All rights reserved Abstract: Background. Infection and rejection represent major complications following lung transplantation and are often associated with pulmonary infiltrates. The differential diagnosis of these infiltrates depends on their timing after transplantation. The aim of this study was to characterize lung transplant recipients (LTR) presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates. Methods. A retrospective analysis of all LTR and heart-lung transplant recipients attending outpatient follow-up at our institution between September 1, 2006 and October 14, 2011 was performed. All patients presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray who underwent bronchoscopy were included. Results. A total of 913 patients accounted for 13,156 attendances, with 3,912 bronchoscopies being performed. Seventy-eight patients (9%) exhibited new pulmonary infiltrates and proceeded to bronchoscopy. Infiltrates occurred at a median 15 (interquartile range [IQR] 5-39) months after transplantation. Forty-eight patients (62%) were male, and median patient age was 47 (IQR 29-57) years. Subsequent investigation revealed pneumonia to be the underlying cause in 63 patients (81%). In the remaining patients, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was responsible in 6 (8%), acute rejection in 5 (6%), and toxic pneumonitis in 4 (5%) patients. Overall 1-year survival in LTR presenting with new infiltrates was 97%, compared with 96% for all LTR attending our Outpatient Department. Conclusions. New pulmonary infiltrates occurring after the first month in LTR are most likely due to infection. Through prompt diagnosis and treatment, early mortality appears unaffected.
