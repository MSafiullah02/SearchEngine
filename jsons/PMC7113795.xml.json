Vaccines and antiviral drugs are two available strategies for preventing and controlling influenza virus infections. It usually takes 3\u20136 months to prepare a vaccine in case of pandemic influenza. During this period, the pandemic can spread, infect humans and cause great damage to the economy (Neumann et al., 2009). In this lag phase, taking antiviral drugs is the only available approach to control and treat the influenza virus infections. Moreover, as influenza virus infection cannot be completely prevented by vaccination, antiviral drugs are still necessary for the therapeutic treatment of influenza (Nistal-Villan and Garcia-Sastre, 2009).",

NA inhibitors including oseltamivir and zanamivir provide an important additional measure for the control of influenza (Boltz et al., 2010). These antiviral drugs target the active center of the influenza virus NA molecule, in which amino acids are largely conserved among influenza A and B viruses (Colman et al., 1993). However, the emergence of NA inhibitor-resistant viruses, as a result of drug use or due to circulation of natural variants, may compromise the clinical utility of this class of anti-influenza agents (Hauge et al., 2009, van der Vries et al., 2010).",

The mechanisms of inhibition of virus replication by polyanions are attributed to inhibition of virus adsorption to the cell membranes and/or virus envelope fusion with the endosomal membranes (Mitsuya et al., 1988, Arnberg et al., 2002, Luscher-Mattli et al., 1993). On influenza virus, several studies have demonstrated that the suppression of viral replication by DS is caused inhibition of hemagglutinin (HA) activity, which plays a role in viral fusion process at the early stage of infection (Luscher-Mattli and Gluck, 1990, Ramalho-Santos and de Lima, 2001). Recently we reported that DS also suppressed the NA activity and release from infected cells at the late stage of the replication, resulting in the suppressive viral replication (Yamada et al., 2012). Since DS is negatively charged, the change in the viral surface from a positive to negative charge by adding DS may play a role in the suppression of viral replication (Moulard et al., 2000, Yamada et al., 2014).",

The resulting innate immune response limits the early spread of infectious organisms, while promoting the development of adaptive immunity. Optimal sequences for the activation of TLR9 vary among species (Bauer et al., 2001). There are at least four types of CpG ODNs, each of which has a different backbone, sequence, and immunostimulatory properties (Vollmer and Krieg, 2009). D-type (also called A) CpG ODNs typically comprise one palindromic CpG motif with a phosphodiester (PO) backbone and phosphorothioate (PS) poly(G) tail to increase resistance to nucleases, and activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce a large amount of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 but fails to induce pDC maturation and B-cell activation (Krug 2001, Verthelyi et al., 2001). The three other types of ODNs consist of a PS backbone. K-type (also called B) CpG ODNs contain nonpalindromic multiple CpG motifs, and strongly activates B cells to produce interleukin (IL)-6 and pDCs to maturation but barely produces IFN-\u03b1 (Hartmann and Krieg, 2000, Verthelyi et al., 2001). C and P-type CpG ODNs contain one and two palindromic CpG sequences, respectively, both of which can activate B cells like K-type and pDC like D-type, although C CpG ODN induces weaker IFN-\u03b1 production compared with P-type CpG ODN (Hartmann and Krieg, 2000, Marshall et al., 2003, Samulowitz et al., 2010).",

Therefore, we examined synthetic ODNs as candidates for anti-influenza compounds in the present study and found that the D-type ODN D35 suppressed the NA activity and release from infected cells at the late stage of infection.",

It has been reported that the formation of multimers is necessary for D-type ODNs to localize to early transferring receptor-positive endosomes to signal through TLR9 and induce IFN\u03b1, and that monomeric sequences behave as competitive antagonists (Wu et al., 2004, Kerkmann et al., 2005, Guiducci et al., 2006). Thus we examined whether the G-tetrad formation would affect D35's suppressive effect on the plaque formation. We used two ODNs, Core-12 which removed 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end poly(G) motifs and 7-deaza D35 which replaced 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end guanines with 7-deazaguanines to impede G-tetrad formation (Table 1). Fig. 3B shows that the plaque formation of PR8 was not suppressed by Core-12 or 7-deaza D35. The results suggest that the G-tetrad formation of D35 is required for its suppressive effect.",

Since it takes 8\u201312 h for influenza viruses to produce its progeny viruses after virus absorption, four treatment intervals covering the whole life cycle of influenza viruses from absorption to progeny production were used to disclose the time frame when D35 exerted the maximal effect. D35 was applied during each of these intervals and the cells were washed three times with MEM at specific time points. Following the treatment, fresh compound-free VDM was added. All treated cells were harvested at 11.5 hpi, and the virus yield was determined by measuring virus titers of every culture. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, apparent inhibition of virus replication by D35 was observed when infected cells were treated with D35 only at the interval of 9\u201311.5 hpi, which corresponded to the late step of influenza virus replication such as budding or release from infected cells. In case of treatment during an interval of 0\u20131 hpi, a moderate inhibition (ca 30%) was observed in infected cells. However, D35 treatment during an interval of 1\u20136 or 4\u20139 hpi did not inhibit virus yield when compared to control groups. These results suggest that D35 inhibits the early and late steps of viral replication. Thus we next examined the suppressive effect of D35 against several strains at early and late steps of viral replication. A severe decrease of viral replication was observed in PR8, Pdm09, Panama, Wyoming, H5N1 and H7N7-infected cells when D35 was present only at the late stage, whereas little reduction in the viral growth of WSN was observed (Fig. 4B and C). The results suggested that D35 mainly suppressed the late stage of viral growth, which includes viral assembly and release from infected cells.",

Thus we examined whether NA activity was suppressed by D35 of late-stage-sensitive influenza virus strains (Fig. 5\nA). The concentrations of D35 that inhibited the NA activity of D35-sensitive PR8 and Panama were much lower than those required to inhibit NA activity of D35-resistant WSN. The result suggest that D35 suppresses the enzymatic activity of NA in D35-sensitive influenza viruses. In addition, an EM experiment showed that D35 treatment induced viral aggregation on the cell surface, whereas such aggregation was not observed in the WSN-infected cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that D35 causes viral aggregation on infected cell surface by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of NA and thus the release of viruses from infected cells.",

Moreover, D35 and oseltamivir showed additive effect against PR8 NA by in vitro NA activity assay (Fig. 7C).

As shown in Fig. 8\nA, the mean weight loss of mice treated with D35 GpC after PR8 infection was significantly less than that of the PBS-treated mice and its effect was similar to the case of oseltamivir treatment. Since mice that received D35 after infection exhibited weight loss at early times after infection (1\u20133 dpi), which was not observed in mice that received PBS or D35 GpC after infection, we supposed that D35 activated immune response, together with activated immune response by influenza virus infection, led to specific weight loss. In contrast, treatment of D35 before infection significantly inhibited weight loss of mice, but treatment of D35 GpC before infection was less efficient. Consistent with improved outcomes, D35, D35 GpC, and oseltamivir significantly reduced PR8 titers in lung homogenates examined at 55 hpi (Fig. 8B).",

Here we found that the K435E mutation in the 430-loop of D35-sensitive PR8 NA changed it to D35-resistant. In addition, PR8 with NA containing the K432E mutation in the 430-loop was partially resistant to D35 (Fig. 6B). The results suggest that the 430-loop of PR8 NA is the main target for D35, as well as DS. Using molecular dynamics simulations of influenza NA, extended conformational shifts of the 150-loop and 430-loop in NA were observed (Amaro et al., 2007, Amaro et al., 2009). It has been demonstrated that these NA regions can open to a much larger extent than was anticipated from prior X-ray structure analyses, which can be systematically explored for the development of more potent, chemically diverse inhibitors. It has been reported that a novel small-molecule inhibitor can inhibit viral replication of both the H1N1 and H5N1 viruses and the compound is predicted to establish hydrogen bonds with residues V116 and R156 of the 150-loop and T439 of the 430-loop (An et al., 2009). They also suggested that another binding site within the pocket formed by the 430-loop could be accessed by the new inhibitors.

However, a marked increase in oseltamivir-resistant isolates has been reported and these strains have become prevalent worldwide (Hauge et al., 2009, Hurt et al., 2009). We showed that the recombinant virus H274Y, which is resistant to oseltamivir, was sensitive to D35, K435E was sensitive to oseltamivir, and D35 and oseltamivir had additive effect against PR8 (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the region of the NA responsible for oseltamivir-sensitivity differs from that for D35-sensitivity, and that D35 might be useful for the treatment of infection with oseltamivir-resistant virus. However, since we have not determined whether D35 reduces replication of recent oseltamivir-resistant virus strains, it should be studied in future. In case of treating AIDS, combination therapy, which uses two or more drugs simultaneously to inhibit HIV replication, has been developed to lower toxicity by decreasing the dosage of individual compounds. This approach reduces the risk of developing drug resistance and maintains synergistic antiviral activity (De Clercq, 1995), and would be a major advance in the treatment of influenza virus infection.",

Amphipathic and polyanionic PS-oligonucleotides (ONs) have a sequence-independent antiviral activity (Gao et al., 1990, Yao et al., 1993, Fennewald et al., 1995). PS-ONs prevent viral attachment or entry via interaction with viral glycoproteins such as HIV-1, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and hepatitis C virus (Vaillant et al., 2006, Guzman et al., 2007, Matsumura et al., 2009). However, the antiviral activity of PS-ONs is dependent on the length and hydrophobicity of the ONs. It has been known that phosphorothioation increases the hydrophobicity of ONs (Agrawal et al., 1990). The increased hydrophobicity of PS-ONs contributes to their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 fusion and entry, because longer PS-ONs (\u226530 bases) which have a greater hydrophobicity are more potent in blocking the hydrophobic interactions involved in the gp41 six-helix bundle formation and inhibiting the HIV-1-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion than shorter PS-ONs (<30 bases) (Vaillant et al., 2006). The antiviral activity of PS-ONs in duck hepatitis B virus infectionis also size dependent, with PS-ONs \u226540 bases in length displaying the highest activity (Noordeen et al., 2013). Thus we speculated that longer PS-ODNs than K3 (20 bases) would have an anti-influenza activity.",

Moreover, a GT rich 20 base PS-ODN has a potent antiviral activity against HSV which is thought to be mediated by a conformational change in the viral glycoprotein gB (Shogan et al., 2006). D35 inhibited significantly the replication of influenza viruses, but A151, which did not multimerize and form aggregates, did not (Fig. 1, Fig. 2C). Thus our results suggest that in contrast to ODNs with an ability to inhibit HIV-1 or HSV, for inhibiting influenza A viruses ODNs need to mutimerize and aggregate. It has been reported that D19 (g\u02c6gtgcatcgatgcagg\u02c6g\u02c6g\u02c6g\u02c6g, \u02c6: phosphorothioated), which has same sequence as D35 and two more PS linkage at the 3\u2032 end poly(G) track than D35, consists an extremely heterogeneous mixture of secondary structures in DPBS and a portion of the D19 molecules exists as very high-order aggregates containing more than 30 D19 strands (Marshall et al., 2003). We do not know why spontaneous formation of nanoparticles was responsible for inhibiting influenza A viruses; however, the antiviral activity of DS against a influenza A virus increases when the molecular weight is increased from 1000 to 10,000 and levels off when the molecular weight was further increased to 70,000 (Hosoya et al., 1991). The result may suggest that the size of multimerized ODNs is important.",

It has also been reported that intranasal pretreatment with TLR3 agonist poly(I\u00b7C) and, to a lesser extent, a synthetic TLR9 agonist protects mice against lethal coronavirus infection and intranasal pretreatment with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 protects mice against lethal influenza pneumonia (Zhao et al., 2012). Thus it was plausible that TLR9 agonist D35, but not D35 GpC, induced cytokines such as type I IFN by TLR9 activation and protecred mice against influenza virus infection. However, in mice treated with D35 GpC without unmethylated CpG after infection, viral titers in lung homogenates were reduced and body weight losses were minimal, suggesting that immune response through TLR9 leading to cytokine expression were not involved in protective effect of D35 GpC. Although D35 treatment before or after infection reduced viral titers in lung homogenates more than D35 GpC, mice that received D35 after infection exhibited larger weight loss than D35 GpC-treated mice at early times after infection (Fig. 7). The consequences of inappropriate TLR9 activation can be detrimental for the host, contributing to the pathogenesis of bacterial septic shock or autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Ehlers and Ravetch, 2007). Thus we think that D35 GpC without a CpG motif would be a better candidate for influenza virus treatment than D35 containing a CpG motif.",
