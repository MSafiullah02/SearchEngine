            "text": "The major human pathogens among the flaviviruses are yellow fever (YF) virus, the four serotypes of dengue (DEN) viruses, Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses. Flaviviruses contain a positive-stranded RNA genome that is approximately 10,500 nucleotides in length. The RNA contains a type 1 cap at its 5\u2032 terminus (Cleaves and Dubin, 1979) but is not polyadenylated (Wengler and Wengler, 1981), and it encodes a single, long open reading frame (ORF) (reviewed in Chambers et al., 1990). All evidence indicates that virus-specific proteins are derived by co- or posttranslational cleavage of the polyprotein encoded by the ORF. These include three structural proteins [capsid (C), premembrane (preM), and envelope (E)] and at least seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, in that gene order). Most cleavages of the polyprotein are mediated by the host cell enzyme signal peptidase or by a viral protease complex requiring a central hydrophilic domain in NS2B and the amino terminus of NS3 (Falgout 1991, Chambers 1993). Genomic RNA contains noncoding regions (NCR) 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the ORF. The 5\u2032-NCR is about 100 nucleotides in length, and the 3\u2032-NCR is 400 to nearly 800 nucleotides in length (Table I\n). The conserved structural and nucleotide sequence elements of these NCRs and their function in RNA replication and translation are the subjects of this review.",

NCRs may also play a role in the packaging of nascent virions and contain nucleotide sequences required to initiate translation. Of the viral proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, and NS5 have been implicated directly or indirectly in RNA replication. The role of NS1 in this process is not defined, but mutations in NS1 have been shown to affect the initiation of minus-strand synthesis (Lindenbach 1997, Lindenbach 1999, Muylaert 1997). NS2A is a small hydrophobic protein localized to the replication complex that may target it to membrane organelles (Mackenzie et al., 1998). NS3 contains an RNA helicase and nucleotide triphosphatase activities in addition to its protease activity (Wengler 1991, Warrener 1993, Utama 2000), and NS4A may form a required association with NS1 during replication (Lindenbach and Rice, 1999). NS5 functions as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Tan 1996, Ranjith-Kumar 2001) and also contains a potential methyl-transferase activity, possibly required for the capping of progeny viral genomes (Koonin, 1993).",

Input genome RNA must first be copied to form full-length minus strands in order to generate stable double-stranded replicative forms (RF). Free minus-strand genomic RNA is not detected (Chu 1985, Khromykh 1997), and the plus and minus RNA strands in the RF appear to be exact copies of each other, such that there are no overhanging unpaired nucleotides at the 3\u2032 termini of either strand (Wengler and Wengler, 1981). Plus-strand RNA synthesis is thought to proceed in replicative intermediates, using RFs as a template. No subgenomic virus-specific RNAs have been detected in flavivirus-infected cells, in support of the concept that the genomic plus-strand RNA is the only virus-specific mRNA. The RNA replication process appears to be localized to perinuclear membrane organelles, probably in complexes containing nascent RNA and NS proteins in association with cellular proteins (Chu 1985, Chu 1987, Ng 1989, Westaway 1999).",

The total number of nucleotides in each genome is also shown for comparison. Flaviviruses have been speciated, and species have been subgrouped, by results of virus cross-neutralization assays (Calisher et al., 1989). The results of such assays depend on antigenic differences among the respective envelope glycoproteins of the different viruses. Seven subgroups were thus defined, but at least 15 viruses remained ungrouped, including YF virus. For example, the four serotypes of dengue viruses form one subgroup or \u201ccomplex\u201d among the mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Similarly, the Japanese encephalitis virus complex includes JE, West Nile (WN), and Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) viruses. The tick-borne flaviviruses (e.g., TBE virus strains Sofjin and Neudorfl and Powassan virus, see Table I) form a complex that is serologically distinct from the mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Cell-Fusing Agent virus (CFA) was isolated from cultured mosquito cells and appears to have no serological relationship to other flaviviruses in the cross-neutralization assay, has no vector in nature, and causes no illness in humans or animals (Cammisa-Parks et al., 1992).",

Results of the analysis for grouping flaviviruses in clades were quite comparable to those obtained by the cross-neutralization assay as it was used to define antigenic complexes or subgroups, suggesting a parallel evolution of genome sequences and antigenic character.

Lengths of the 5\u2032 NCR sequences are between 89 nucleotides, for dengue serotype 2 (DEN2) strain New Guinea C (NGC), and 132 nucleotides, for TBE strain Sofjin. Tick-borne flaviviruses (strain Sofjin, strain Neudorfl, and Powassan) tend to have slightly longer 5\u2032 NCRs than mosquito-borne viruses. For comparison, the 5\u2032 NCR of a typical isolate of the hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus, is 341 nucleotides in length (Fukushi et al., 1994), whereas that of a picornavirus, poliovirus type 1, is 742 nucleotides in length (Rezapkin et al., 1998). This discrepancy in length of the 5\u2032 NCRs of these otherwise related positive-strand RNA virus genomes is due primarily to the fact that the hepatitis C and poliovirus 5\u2032 NCRs each contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) required for translation initiation (Wang 1995, Brown 1992, Bergamini 2000, Poyry 2001). IRESs are fairly large tRNA-like structures composed of hundreds of nucleotides. In contrast, translation of flavivirus RNAs is thought to initiate by ribosome scanning from the 5\u2032 cap structure (Ruiz-Linares, 1989) so possibly there is an adaptive advantage related to having a short 5\u2032 NCR.",

The 3\u2032 NCRs of the TBE viruses, other than strains Neudorfl and Sofjin, vary greatly in length due to the presence of long poly(A) tracts in some genomes that are not present in others and due to deletions of sequences flanking the poly(A) tract within the variable region (see later for details). Many dozens of complete genome sequences of flavivirus have been entered in Genbank.

The identical five-nucleotide sequences near the 3\u2032 termini of both plus- and minus-strand RNAs were posited as recognition sites for the viral replicase that could be used in common during either positive- or negative-strand RNA synthesis (Rice et al., 1985).",

The CFA virus genome is unique among the flaviviruses in that it terminates with GC-3\u2032 and its 5\u2032-terminal two nucleotides (5\u2032-GU) are not complementary. The survey also revealed that the sequence ACACA and its complement are not well conserved in analogous positions in 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NCRs, respectively, of flavivirus genomes (Fig. 1). For example, JE and Kunjin virus genomes do contain such sequences in the predicted locations, whereas the related MVE virus genome does not, and viruses of the DEN subgroup do not. Therefore, the significance of the \u201cACACA-type\u201d sequences near the 3\u2032 termini of plus and minus strands of the YF, WN, JE, KUN, and perhaps other flavivirus genomes must be regarded as uncertain, especially since the functionality of other better conserved segments of the NCRs in RNA replication has been demonstrated.",

The motif is so named because of the existence of a complementary sequence in the 3\u2032 NCR. Base pairing between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end sequences would in theory permit the formation of cyclized plus strands, perhaps during the initial phases of RNA replication. This conformation was initially predicted to permit the viral replicase to bind to both ends of the template RNA simultaneously in order to assure the generation of full-length copies (Hahn et al., 1987). Similar \u201cpanhandle\u201d structures are thought to form, for example, during the replication of alphavirus (Hsu et al, 1973) and bunyavirus (Hewlett et al., 1977) RNAs and of phage QB RNA (Blumenthal and Carmichael, 1979).",

The 5\u2032CS actually lies within the ORF, about 34 to 40 nucleotides downstream from the start codon (Fig. 2).

C1 and C2 differ markedly in linear sequence from each other and from that of the 5\u2032CS in mosquito-borne virus genomes (Table II\n). Tick-borne virus 5\u2032-NCRs contain a very short ORF that is terminated with a stop codon within the NCR (Fig. 3).

Thus there were a total of 11 or 12 contiguous base pairings possible for cyclization of YF, MVE, WN, and DEN2 RNAs, resulting in a predicted thermal stability of from \u22129.1 kcal (for MVE RNA) to \u221212.3 kcal (for YF RNA). This was deemed to be sufficient free energy to cyclize flavivirus RNAs based on the previous observation that alphavirus RNAs could cyclize under physiological conditions (Hsu et al., 1973) and that the free energy of cyclization of alphavirus RNA measured thermodynamically was determined to be \u221213.5 kcal at 25\u00b0C (Frey et al., 1979). Additional but noncontiguous complementarity further upstream from the 5\u2032CS and downstream from the 3\u2032 CYC sequence was predicted to stabilize the panhandle further for some of the RNAs, resulting in an increase of potential thermal stability to \u221220.5, \u221225.5, and \u221233.7 kcal, respectively, for the panhandle form of the WN, MVE, and YF genomes (Hahn et al., 1987). The predicted thermal stability of the double-stranded regions potentially formed by base pairing of C1 with C1\u2032 and of C2 with C2\u2032 in the TBE virus genome was \u221219.8 and \u221230.9 kcal, respectively (Khromykh et al., 2001).

First, in a study of the requirements for nucleotide sequences of the DEN4 3\u2032 NCR for virus replication, Men and co-workers (1996) created a series of mutant DEN genomic RNAs by the transcription of DEN4 infectious DNAs containing internal deletions centered about a unique ApaI restriction endonuclease site located between the conserved tandem repeat sequences CS2 and RCS2 (see later) in wild-type DEN4 DNA (Fig 2, Fig 4). Eight mutant RNAs containing deletions ranging in size from 30 to 262 nucleotides, in which all or portions of CS2, RCS2, and CS1 were deleted, were evaluated for their infectivity. Although all the RNAs gave rise to viruses that were reduced in replication competence compared to wild type, only one RNA (mutant 3\u2032d172\u201383) had a lethal phenotype. The deletion in this RNA was unique in that it included all of the 23 nucleotide CS1 segment in DEN4 RNA, whereas the maximum downstream extent of any of the other seven deletions spared the entirety of CS1. These results demonstrated that CS1, including the 8-nucleotide cyclization sequence, was indispensible for virus replication.",

They demonstrated that an RNA with a deletion starting at codon 20 of the capsid gene and extending to include downstream sequences encoding the premembrane protein and the entire ectodomain of the envelope glycoprotein (mutant C20rep) replicated efficiently in hamster kidney (BHK) cells, whereas an otherwise identical deletion mutation, in which the 5\u2032 end of the deletion extended upstream to codon 2 of the capsid gene (mutant C2rep), was lethal for RNA replication. Similarly, another mutant RNA in which the capsid start codon and sequences downstream encoding the remainder of capsid, all of the premembrane protein, and the amino-terminal majority of the envelope protein (mutant \u0394CME) was also replication defective. C20rep RNA contained the 5\u2032CS for the Kunjin genome, whereas the mutants C2rep and \u0394CME RNAs did not. This suggested that either the RNA sequence (including the 5\u2032CS) within the ORF encoding the amino terminus of capsid or translation of the amino terminus of capsid was necessary for RNA replication. The results of follow-up experiments favored the former hypothesis, that nucleotide sequences comprising the 5\u2032 terminus of the ORF, including the 5\u2032CS, were required for RNA replication.",

You and Padmanabhan (1999) reported on an in vitro assay for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity in DEN2-infected mosquito cell extracts using exogenous subgenomic RNAs containing the 5\u2032-terminal 230 nucleotides and\u29f8or the 3\u2032-terminal 373 nucleotides of the DEN2 genome as templates. 5\u2032-terminal DEN2 sequences containing the 5\u2032CS sequence, either linked covalently to the 3\u2032-terminal DEN2 RNA sequence or supplied in trans, were required for replication to initiate on the 3\u2032-terminal RNA segment. Mutagenesis of either the 5\u2032 or the 3\u2032 cyclization sequence such that base pairing between them was abrogated resulted in total loss of in vitro RdRP activity, but when both sequences were mutagenized such that the mutant cyclization sequences were complementary, RdRP activity was detected. This demonstrated that cyclization sequences were required for synthesis of a covalently closed double-stranded hairpin molecule in vitro. Free progeny RNA molecules were not detected in this system. However, Khromykh and colleagues (2001) addressed the relevant question in vivo using the KUN replicon system. They initially created a 5\u2032CS deletion mutation in KUN replicon RNA and demonstrated that the resulting RNA was no longer competent for replication. Next, they created substitution mutations in either the 5\u2032CS or the 3\u2032CYC sequence in order to disrupt base pairing between them. As seen in the in vitro study, abrogation of their complementarity by mutagenesis of either cyclization sequence was also lethal for RNA replication. However, when both cyclization sequences were mutagenized with respect to the wild-type sequence such that their capacity to base pair was maintained, RNA replication, including de novo minus and plus strand synthesis, was restored.",

CS1, as originally described by Hahn and colleagues (1987), consisted of a 25 nucleotide segment in the MVE 3\u2032 NCR that was nearly but not totally conserved among viruses of the same subgroup and between subgroups. For example, CS1 for the MVE genome differs from that of the WN genome by one nucleotide substitution and the deletion of a single nucleotide, whereas CS1 in the JE virus genome differs from that of MVE by only a single nucleotide substitution. The sequence in the MVE genome differs from that found in the DEN1 and DEN3 genomes in length in that the DEN sequences appear to contain two discrete single nucleotide deletions and two discrete single nucleotide A to G substitution mutations with respect to the reference. DEN2 and DEN4 genomes contain the identical deletion mutations but only one of the two substitution mutations with respect to the MVE sequence.

A study of partial nucleotide sequence data for genomes of 13 YF field isolates (Wang et al., 1996) revealed that only the West African strain genomes contained a 511-nucleotide 3\u2032 NCR, including three tandem repeat sequences. Genomes of strains from central and east Africa and from South America had shorter 3\u2032 NCRs (443 to 469 nucleotides) due to the lower number of YF-specific repeat sequences. Central and east African strains had only two YF-specific repeats, and those from South America had only one copy of the \u201crepeat\u201d sequence. On the basis of overall nucleotide sequence relatedness, it was speculated that duplication of the repeated sequence took place in west Africa after introduction of the YF virus into South America. The resulting variation in lengths of 3\u2032 NCRs of the genomes of YF virus isolates, due to duplication and\u29f8or deletion of redundant nucleotide sequences within the 5\u2032 proximal portion of the 3\u2032 NCR, is reminiscent of that observed among the genomes of different strains of TBE virus (see later).",

Perhaps more work will be done in this area in the future, as the use of full-length infectious DNAs to effect site-directed mutagenesis of the flavivirus genome has become more common. However, it is clear that deletion of conserved repeat sequences alters virus growth properties. As mentioned previously, Men and co-workers (1996) created a series of eight different mutant dengue genomic RNAs derived from DEN4-infectious DNAs containing internal deletions centered about a unique ApaI restriction endonuclease site located at nucleotide \u2013171 in the DEN4 genome, about midway between CS2 and RCS2 (Fig 2, Fig 4). Thus, all or portions of CS2 and\u29f8or RCS2 were deleted in six of the resulting seven viable deletion mutant viruses. (The eighth mutant RNA contained a deletion of CS1, which proved to be lethal, as discussed previously.) The maximum 3\u2032 boundary of any deletion that gave rise to virus was 113 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end of the genome, preserving CS1 and the 3\u2032 stem and loop (SL). One DEN4 mutant containing a 121-nucleotide deletion that included all of RCS2 and most of the upstream portion of the 3\u2032 NCR (mutant 3\u2032d303-183) was only slightly impaired for replication in cultured monkey kidney cells compared to wild-type virus. In contrast, a mutant containing a 60-nucleotide deletion that included almost all of CS2 (mutant 3\u2032d172-113) was reduced in peak titer by about 10-fold with respect to wild type in both experiments. This suggested that CS2 may be more critical for viability than RCS2. Interestingly, a mutant that contained a deletion of only 30 nucleotides (3\u2032d172-143) between CS2 and RCS2, but sparing both conserved sequences, was more impaired for replication than either mutant 3\u2032d172-113 or 3\u2032d303-183 in that its peak titers in the two assays were reduced compared to wild type by about 100-fold. This indicates that nonconserved nucleotides between CS2 and RCS2 are important for virus viability, possibly because of a requirement for spacing between the two conserved sequences or possibly because this deletion removed a DEN and JE subgroup conserved SL structure (TL2) predicted by Proutski and colleagues (1997b). Mutant virus 3\u2032d172-143 is currently under study as a potential DEN vaccine candidate (Durbin et al., 2001).",

For example, the 3\u2032 NCR in TBE strain Neudorfl virus is 764 nucleotides in length (Table I), whereas that of TBE strain RK 1424 virus is only 350 nucleotides in length (Fig. 3; Wallner et al., 1995). Accumulated nucleotide sequence data also show that this variability is due to differences in length of the upstream portion of the 3\u2032 NCR; the most 3\u2032-terminal 325 nucleotides are conserved in all strains and share a high degree of sequence identity. Wallner and co-workers (1995) referred to the conserved 3\u2032-terminal segment as the \u201ccore element\u201d of the 3\u2032 NCR and designated any upstream sequences as part of a \u201cvariable region.\u201d Their findings were remarkable in that the viruses under study are all strain variants of a single serotype. In contrast, the 3\u2032 NCRs of the four serotypes of DEN viruses, for example, are nevertheless highly conserved with respect to both length and sequence content, perhaps because the DEN 3\u2032 NCR is minimal in the functional sequence content required for a viable flavivirus (Fig. 2). Thus the DEN 3\u2032 NCR may be analogous to the core element of the 3\u2032 NCR in TBE virus genomes. A comparison of the conserved sequences in 3\u2032 NCRs of TBE virus genomes to those of the Powassan virus genome (Mandl et al., 1993) revealed that the latter genome has conserved features similar to TBE strain Neudorfl genome (to be described), except that the poly(A) tract found in strain Neudorfl and other TBE genomes is not present in the Powassan virus genome.",

Essential elements of the core are as follows. (1) The approximately 100 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides of the core region are predicted to form the flavivirus-conserved SL structure, which has been mentioned previously and which is discussed in greater detail later. Among the TBE virus genomes, the nucleotide sequence within the 3\u2032 stem and loop varies only in segments that are not required for base pairing to form the stem region of the secondary structure, with the exception of the conserved CACAG pentanucleotide box. (2) There is a short inverted repeat sequence (IR in Fig. 3) about 150 nucleotides upstream from the 3\u2032 terminus. The sequence has a very high GC content and a correspondingly high predicted thermal stability of \u223c19 kcal. Therefore, Wallner and co-workers (1995) suggested that there is a high probability that the IR actually forms a hairpin structure in vivo. (3) Adjacent to the IR sequence and overlapping it by three nucleotides is a 20-nucleotide stretch of purine residues, extending toward the 3\u2032 terminus of the RNA. This is the longest homopurine (PU) sequence within the entire genome of the TBE strain Neudorfl virus, apart from the poly(A) tract in the variable region of the 3\u2032 NCR. (4) A few nucleotides further downstream from the PU sequence is a 14-nucleotide homopyrimidine (PY) sequence. (5) Thirty nucleotides still further downstream from the PY box exists a second conserved 14-nucleotide pyrmidine-rich (PR) sequence (consisting of 13 pyrimidine residues and one purine residue). The 3\u2032 cyclization sequence, C1\u2032, lies within the PR box. The PU, PY, and PR boxes and of course the sequence of C1\u2032, among other features of the TBE 3\u2032 NCR, are semiconserved in the Powassan virus genome (Mandl et al., 1993), suggesting their fundamental importance in replication. Homopurine and -pyrimidine stretches have been found to function in processes related to the regulation of translation (Avni 1994, Behe 1995), stabilization of RNA (Czyzyk-Krzeska et al., 1994), or in (retrovirus) RNA replication (Hungnes et al., 1992). It is perhaps noteworthy that the PU, PY, and PR boxes are found at loci in the genome analogous to those occupied by CS2 and CS1 in the mosquito-borne virus genomes, although there is no significant sequence homology between TBE or Powassan virus-specific domains and those of mosquito-borne viruses.",

They attempted to relate their findings (1) to other strain-specific parameters, such as the year, geographic origin, or source of the virus isolate, (2) to a dendrogram showing evolutionary relationships among the strains, derived by comparing sequence data for a 375-nucleotide segment of the NS5 gene, and (3) to a second dendrogram derived by comparing sequence data for the core elements of the various 3\u2032 NCRs. These analyses failed to yield any workable hypothesis to explain their observations. However, the close agreement between the dendrogram obtained by comparing the sequences of the NS5 coding regions to that obtained by comparing those of the core elements suggested that the sequences evolved in parallel. This implied that the heterogeneity in length of the variable regions did not evolve by intragenic recombination. Additional consideration of the details of the results of the sequence analysis led to the conclusion that the observed diversity in lengths of the 3\u2032 NCRs in these genomes was most likely due to deletion events and that therefore the viruses were likely to have evolved from a common ancestor with a long 3\u2032 NCR, such as those found in the genomes of strains Neudorfl and 263. Furthermore, these \u201clong\u201d 3\u2032 NCRs were thought to have arisen from an ancestral virus with a \u201cshort\u201d 3\u2032 NCR by duplication events, as the variable region consists in a large part of direct repeats of sequence elements found in the core element and in the ORF. Other unique sequences in the variable region may have arisen by intragenic recombination over short segments within subdomains.",

One strain of bovine viral diarrhea virus was found to have a 41-nucleotide deletion in the variable region of its 3\u2032 NCR as compared to two other strains of this virus (Deng and Brock, 1993). There was at least a loose inverse correlation of the variation in length of the 3\u2032 NCRs in TBE strains to their virulence; strains Neudorfl and 263 were less virulent in mice than strain Hypr (which had a relatively short 3\u2032 NCR).

They determined the 3\u2032 NCR nucleotide sequence for 14 mutant viruses thus derived. The frequency with which 3\u2032 NCR deletions arose appeared to correlate best with the initial number of passages of virus in BHK cells. The spontaneous internal deletions that occurred in the 3\u2032 NCR had the following characteristics. (1) All deletions affected the variable region exclusively. (2) The deletions affected any and all sequence elements of the variable region [from nucleotide 10,394 to nucleotide 10,811, which is 15 nucleotides downstream from the AgeI restriction endonuclease site (at nucleotide 10,796) that defines the boundary between the core element and the variable region (Fig. 3)]. (3) The poly(A) tract was removed in all deletion events, although short homoadenosine sequences were often retained. (4) There was some tendency for the deletions to cluster around certain nucleotides. The three largest deletions detected in this study were all of more than 300 nucleotides, and all of these resulted in the removal of the R2 repeat adjacent to the AgeI site, the upstream R3 repeat sequence, the intervening heterogeneous sequence between R3 and the nearest R1 repeat, all of the poly(A) tract, and all or most of the R1 repeat that flanks the poly(A) tract at its upstream boundary.",

The remaining five larger deletions also initiated on their upstream ends at the stop codon and extended to varying lengths on the downstream end into the core element. The longest deletion included all of the 3\u2032 NCR from the stop codon to the PU tract. All of these deletion mutant DNAs gave rise to viable mutant viruses, except for the longest of the deletions, just described (which included in its extent both potential 3\u2032 cyclization sequences, C1\u2032 and C2\u2032, and the conserved IR sequence). Among the viable mutant viruses, only the one with the largest deletion, extending from the stop codon to the downstream end of R3 in the core element, was reduced in peak titer compared to all other wild-type and mutant viruses by about 100-fold in a growth curve. This result was in contrast to that observed for internal deletion mutations of the 3\u2032 NCR in the DEN4 virus genome, where all deletion mutants had, to varying degrees, a reduced capacity for replication in tissue culture. However, it could be argued that the short DEN genome 3\u2032 NCRs are already functionally similar to the TBE core element, such that deletion mutations invariably remove sequences required for fully efficient replication.",

However, there were marked differences in lethality of the viruses for 5-week-old mice after subcutaneous inoculation. This difference in virulence was directly correlated with the size of the deletion in the 3\u2032 NCR, such that the mutant virus with the largest deletion was more than 10,000-fold less virulent than wild-type strain Neudorfl. In contrast, the virus containing a deletion limited only to the entire variable region of the wild-type strain Neudorfl 3\u2032 NCR was indistinguishable from its parent in each of these assays. Thus the attenuation phenotype could be attributed to deletions of portions of the core element only. The variable region did not appear to have any relevant function for the growth of TBE virus in cell culture or in mice, as demonstrated by the occurrence of spontaneous deletions that affected almost all parts of this segment of the 3\u2032 NCR. Additional support for this conclusion arose from the finding that the engineered strain Neudorfl deletion mutant virus that contained a deletion of the entire variable region exhibited no change in its biology compared to the wild-type strain Neudorfl virus. These results also raised the possibility that TBE strains with \u201cshort\u201d 3\u2032 NCRs had undergone spontaneous deletion mutations during the processes of virus isolation and normal additional passaging in tissue culture.",

Four internal deletions were created in the 3\u2032 NCR of an infectious DNA for an egg passage-attenuated Langat virus, a tick-borne virus highly antigenically related to TBE viruses. These all had their upstream boundaries at the stop codon for the ORF and extended downstream 320, 374, 449, and 471 nucleotides, respectively. All of these deletions eliminated short upstream portions of the core element, and only the 320 nucleotide deletion yielded viable virus when deletion mutant RNA was transfected into susceptible cells. Thus deletion of as little as 54 additional nucleotides of the core element (the difference between the 320-nucleotide deletion and the 374-nucleotide deletion) was lethal, even though the 3\u2032 SL, C1\u2032, C2\u2032, and other more downstream features of the TBE 3\u2032 NCR (Fig. 3) were intact in the 374-nucleotide deletion mutant.

While only short regions within the 5\u2032 NCRs were conserved among different subgroups, significant sequence homology was observed among viruses of the same subgroup, and an almost complete conservation of nucleotide sequence was observed among different strains of the same virus, i.e., the seven isolates of SLE virus and two different strains of WN virus. For each 5\u2032 NCR sequence, secondary structures of similar size, shape, and predicted thermodynamic stability could be formed. In each case, the structures consisted of a stem with a small top loop and a larger side loop (Fig. 7\n). In most cases, a second short stem could be formed by 3\u2032-terminal sequences of the 5\u2032 NCR, including the predicted start codon for the long ORF and downstream nucleotides in the ORF. The predicted thermal stability of the long stem structures ranged from \u221217.3 kcal (for the SLE sequence) to \u221227.8 kcal (for the WN strain E101 sequence, as shown). The conservation of this secondary structure in unrelated flavivirus genomes was taken as evidence of its possible importance in replication.",

The linear sequence of the 5\u2032 NCR is partially conserved between DEN and WN species (Fig. 7). For example, nucleotides 1\u20137, 11\u201316, 21\u201325, 55\u201360, and 69\u201377, numbering from the 5\u2032 terminus of the WN strain E101 sequence, are present in the 5\u2032 NCRs of both the DEN4 strain 814669 and the WN strain E101 genomes. Conservation of sequence and predicted secondary structure are much higher when any two DEN 5\u2032 NCRs are compared. Nine distinct deletions of from 5 to 12 nucleotides each were created between nucleotides 50 and 87 of the DEN4 sequence in the context of a DEN4 infectious DNA. In addition, two deletions of 5 and 26 nucleotides, respectively, were created downstream (involving nucleotides 94 to 98; d94-98) and upstream (d18-43) from the central targeted domain. Nucleotide 98 is four nucleotides upstream from the start codon of the DEN4 ORF. Mutants d55-60, d62-68, d69-75, and d82-87 contained deletions of nucleotides that were base paired in the long stem region of the 5\u2032 NCR, whereas mutants d50-54, d58-64, d76-81, d73-77, d76-87, and d94-98 contained deletions in the shorter stem or non\u2013base-paired regions within the long stem. Mutant d18-43 contained a deletion of the upper loop and the adjacent upper portion of the long stem, as shown for the WN 5\u2032 NCR in Fig. 7. Five mutations were deemed lethal, in that infectious virus could not be recovered after transfection of cultured monkey kidney cells with RNA derived in vitro by the transcription of mutagenized DNAs. These were mutants d55-60, d58-64, d62-68, d69-75, and d94-98. Nucleotides 55 to 75 in the DEN4 genome are analogous to nucleotides 60 to 80 in the WN 5\u2032 NCR secondary structure shown in Fig. 7. In general, failure of the four contiguous deletion mutations (spanning DEN4 nucleotides 55 to 75) to yield viable viruses was ascribed to a requirement for those nucleotides for formation of the base pairs that constitute the bottom-most portion of the long stem and the short stem, which also requires nucleotides in the ORF for its formation.",

Mutant d82-87 had a host range-restricted phenotype in that it uniquely failed to replicate in mosquito cells and in adult mosquitoes, apparently due to a defect in RNA synthesis. Translation of a portion of the DEN4 ORF containing the d82-87 5\u2032 NCR was also least efficient among all the mutants tested. However, the cell-free translation assay was not predictive of the viability of mutant viruses; RNAs containing some of the lethal deletion mutations, e.g., d55-60, exhibited enhanced activity in translation compared to wild-type control RNA. Therefore, the dominant effect of deletion mutations on the viability of mutant viruses appeared to be at the level of RNA synthesis. The host range-restricted phenotype of mutant d82-87 also suggested that binding to RNA of host-specific factors, presumably cellular proteins, was a secondary determinant of the viability of mutant viruses.",

The presence of an SL secondary structure in 3\u2032 (\u2212) NCR RNA, formed by the sequence complementary to the SL predicted to occur in the 5\u2032 NCR, was subsequently confirmed by spectroscopy, analysis of thermal melting curves, and selective RNase digestion of an in vitro-transcribed 75-nucleotide RNA representing the SL within the 96 nucleotide 3\u2032 NCR of the WN-negative strand. The 75-nucleotide transcript was then shown to bind specifically to four discrete proteins in three RNA\u2013protein complexes in lysates of BHK cells and in lysates of embryonic fibroblasts derived from C3H\u29f8RV and C3H\u29f8He mice. C3H\u29f8RV mice are homozygous for the flavivirus resistance gene Flv, whereas C3H\u29f8He mice are susceptible to flavivirus infection (Groschel and Koprowski, 1965). Resistance of mice to the pathologic effects of encephalitic flavivirus infection had been shown previously to relate to reduced production of progeny plus strand RNAs at the cellular level. Because RNA\u2013protein complexes formed in lysates of C3H\u29f8RV cells were indistinguishable in size from those formed in C3H\u29f8He cells (and in BHK cells), an investigation was conducted to determine whether the complexes between C3H\u29f8RV proteins and WN 3\u2032 (\u2212) SL RNA were different in stability from those formed between C3H\u29f8He proteins and WN 3\u2032 (\u2212) SL RNA. Complexes 1 and 3 formed in lysates of C3H\u29f8RV cells were shown to have a significantly longer half-life than the analogous complexes formed in C3H\u29f8He cell lysates.",

The host range of most flaviviruses, both in nature and in the laboratory in tissue culture, is very broad. For example, flaviviruses can replicate efficiently in mammalian, avian, insect, reptile, and amphibian hosts, as well as in cell cultures from these hosts (Brinton, 1986). Therfore, one might expect that host cell proteins required for flavivirus replication are highly conserved or that domains required for this function may be conserved within a variety of multifunctional proteins of disparate size in different cell types. Cell proteins that bind 5\u2032 and\u29f8or 3\u2032 NCRs of genomes of several different RNA viruses have been described, including those of mouse hepatitis virus (Furuya and Lai, 1993), bovine coronavirus (Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000), measles virus (Leopardi et al., 1993), Rubella virus (Nakhasi 1990, Nakhasi 1991), Sindbis virus (Pardigon et al., 1993), hepatitis A virus (Schultz 1996, Yi 2000), and hepatitis C virus (Luo 1999, Spangberg 1999). In many cases, the cited reports refer to binding of cellular translation factors to IRES elements found in the 5\u2032 NCRs of hepaciviruses and picornaviruses, among others, but not present in the flavivirus 5\u2032 NCR.

However, the specific interaction of a radiolabeled RNA representing the nucleotide sequence of the WN 3\u2032 SL with proteins in extracts of uninfected BHK cells was reported by Blackwell and Brinton (1995). (BHK cells are a common laboratory cell substrate for growth of the WN virus to very high titers.) Gel mobility shift assays, UV cross-linking, Northwestern blotting, and ion-exchange chromatography were initially used to identify 56-, 84-, and 105-kDa proteins that bound to a truncated in vitro\u2013synthesized fragment of the WN and DEN3 3\u2032 SLs. The unidentified 105-kDa protein species also had significant affinity for an RNA representing the sequence of the 3\u2032 (negative-sense) SL (see earlier discussion). The hypothesis was advanced that this protein may play a role in the initiation of both plus- and minus-strand RNA synthesis. Similar specificity has been reported for other viral systems. For example, one of the cellular proteins that binds rubella virus RNA appears to have specific affinity for both minus- and plus-sense SL structures at the 3\u2032-termini of the respective RNAs (Nakhasi et al., 1991).",

The site for eF1-\u03b1 binding was localized to nucleotides \u201362 to \u201365, the sequence 3\u2032ACAC-5\u2032 (Fig. 6). Li and Brinton (2001) made the possibly relevant observation that an in vitro\u2013synthesized RNA containing the nucleotide sequence of the WN 3\u2032 SL inhibited in vitro translation of WN RNAs containing 5\u2032-terminal portions of the WN ORF and of foreign mRNAs. In contrast, an RNA containing nucleotides representing the 3\u2032-terminal secondary structure of rubella virus RNA enhanced in vitro translation. These contrasting results may indicate that the affinity of the WN 3\u2032 SL for translation elongation factors is significant for upregulating WN viral translation or downregulating translation of cellular mRNAs in vivo. Plant and animal elongation factors eF1-\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are recognized components of replicases in other systems. Das and co-workers (1998) demonstrated that the polymerase of the negative-strand virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which replicates in both insects and mammals, binds eF1-\u03b1 tightly, and that the resulting complex binds eF1-\u03b2 and \u03b3. All three elongation factors are required for VSV replicase activity in an in vitro system. In earlier work, Blumenthal et al. (1976) demonstrated that RNA bacteriophage Q\u03b2 uses three cellular proteins as components of its replicase, the bacterial translation elongation factors, Ts and Tu, and ribosomal protein S1. Further work is required to establish with certainty the physiological significance of the observation that the WN 3\u2032 SL RNA binds translation elongation factors.",

Three RNP complexes thus derived were stable in the presence of high-salt buffer. UV cross-linking and Northwestern blotting analysis identified three proteins involved in RNPs, with apparent molecular masses of 32, 35, and 50 kDa. Gene products derived from a neonatal mouse brain cDNA library were screened for binding to the JE 3\u2032 SL, and a 36-kDa protein, MOV34, was thus identified. Subsequent experiments showed that the MOV34 protein could also bind to the 3\u2032 SL in native full-length JE virus genomic RNA. MOV34 is a 26S proteasome subunit protein that belongs to a family also thought to be involved in RNA transcription and translation. A computer-based comparison of the amino acid sequences of translation elongation factor eF1-\u03b1 and MOV34 revealed no detectable sequence similarity between them, even when constraints for detection were set very low (L. Markoff, unpublished data). However, both of these proteins contain a high proportion of positively and negatively charged amino acids, which could effect an association with RNA and\u29f8or cell membrane organelles. The translation elongation factor sequence is 463 amino acids in length and includes 23 Asp residues, 31 Glu residues, 17 Arg residues, and 47 Lys residues for a net positive charge of +10. MOV34 is 309 amino acids in length and contains 18 Asp residues, 23 Glu residues, 11 Arg residues, and 23 Lys residues for a net negative charge of \u20138.",

Chen and co-workers (1997) made lysates of BHK cells infected with JE virus and first demonstrated that these lysates retained viral RNA synthetic activity. Next, they probed active lysates for proteins that could bind an exogenous 585-nucleotide in vitro\u2013synthesized RNA representing the JE 3\u2032 NCR by UV cross-linking. They focused on proteins that specifically formed in lysates of infected cells, as compared to uninfected cells. Two proteins, p71 and p110, were thus identified. Mapping experiments revealed that protein p110 required only the 3\u2032-terminal 80 nucleotides of the JE genome for binding, whereas protein p71 appeared to have a more diffuse binding site on the 585-nucleotide probe. The two proteins were subsequently identified as NS5 and NS3, respectively. The results of immune precipitation assays suggested further that NS5 and NS3 formed a complex with each other in association with the 3\u2032 NCR.",

RNA derived from \u201cD2\u29f8WN-SL\u201d DNA was infectious in that DEN2-specific immune fluorescence was observed in transfected cells, but the resulting virus was highly impaired for replication; it never achieved a titer greater than 100 pfu\u29f8ml in monkey cells. In contrast, DEN2 wild-type virus derived from RNA transcribed in vitro typically grew to titers >10E6 pfu\u29f8ml.

Six additional DEN2 3\u2032 SL mutant DNAs were created, and the growth phenotypes of the resulting viruses in LLCMK2 cells are summarized in relation to their 3\u2032 SL structure in Fig. 8\n. The mutations were \u201clethal,\u201d meaning no positive immunofluorescence could be detected in transfected cells; \u201csublethal,\u201d meaning the viruses replicated about as well as the parent mutant, D2\u29f8WN-SL; or \u201cviable,\u201d meaning peak titers in LLCMK2 cells were equal to or no worse than 10- or 100-fold reduced compared to the wild-type DEN2 virus. Results identified an 11-bp segment, comprising the uppermost portion of the bottom of the wild-type DEN2 3\u2032 SL sequence, as being essential in viable virus mutants (DEN2 nucleotides 7\u201317 and 63\u201373 in Fig. 6). In addition, the study demonstrated that the DEN2-specific nucleotide sequence of the \u201ctop\u201d portion of the DEN2 3\u2032 SL was not required for efficient replication, but that its base-paired structure was essential. A mutant in which the entire top portion of the WN 3\u2032 SL was substituted for that of the DEN2 3\u2032 SL grew as well as the wild-type virus, but a second mutant, in which base pairing in the top portion of the long stem was abrogated by mutagenesis of the DEN2 nucleotide sequence, had a lethal phenotype.

Thus, site-directed mutagenesis of either the 5\u2032 NCR (Cahour et al., 1995) or the 3\u2032 SL (Zeng et al., 1998) may result in the genesis of host range-restricted mutant DEN viruses. These findings support the hypothesis that host cell proteins play an important role in virus replication. Zeng and co-workers (1998) also demonstrated that DEN2 mutant F virus was defective in RNA synthesis at early times after infection of mosquito cells using an assay that did not distinguish between plus- and minus-strand synthesis. However, a more specific mechanism for the host range-restricted phenotype of DEN2 mutant F virus has not been elucidated thus far. For example, using an in vitro assay for RdRP activity (described previously), You and co-workers (2001) demonstrated that an RNA containing the DEN2 mutant F 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCR nucleotide sequence was not defective for replication in a mosquito cell extract compared to its activity in an extract of monkey kidney cells. Because this assay detected only negative-strand synthesis, perhaps the results indicate that DEN2 mutant F replication is defective at the level of progeny positive-strand RNA synthesis. Other efforts to detect differential binding of mosquito cell proteins to the DEN2 mutant F 3\u2032 SL, using techniques pioneered by Blackwell and Brinton (1995), have thus been unsuccessful (Yu and Markoff, unpublished results).",

For example, Chiou and Chen (2001) reported on the properties and genome sequences of two naturally occurring isolates of JE virus found in an area of Taiwan where local residents have high levels of JE antibodies. One of these isolates, strain T1P1, exhibited 10,000-fold less neurovirulence in mice compared to the other strain, CH1932. A comparison of the complete genome sequences of these two strains revealed that they differed by seven nucleotides. Two of these sequence differences resulted in amino acid changes in NS3, and there were two others in the 3\u2032 NCR, upstream from the 3\u2032 SL. The other three nucleotide sequence differences between the two strains were \u201csilent\u201d ones in the M and NS5 genes. The inference was made that the nucleotide sequence differences noted in NS3 and in the 3\u2032 NCR were responsible for the marked differences in neurovirulence between strain T1P1 and strain CH1932. No attempt was made to determine whether the 3\u2032 SL mutational difference between strains T1P1 and CH1932 resulted in altered binding of virus- or cell-specific proteins to the 3\u2032 NCR.

Sequences representing the 5\u2032-terminal 150 to 170 nucleotides, an intervening poly(A)tract, and the 3\u2032 terminal 110 to 120 nucleotides of the KUN and other mosquito-borne virus genomes, the TBE genome, and the CFA genome were folded by computer using the \u201cMFOLD\u201d program (Mathews et al., 1999) and were based on the assumption of hydrogen bonding between the respective 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 cyclization sequences.

Very similar structures were predicted for the JE, YF, DEN, TBE, and CFA genomes. The model predicts for the KUN genome that (1) 3\u2032 nucleotides \u20131 to \u20138 hydrogen bond to 5\u2032 nucleotides +45 to +52 and (2) 3\u2032 nucleotides \u201311 to \u201314 and \u201368 to \u2013106 hydrogen bond with 5\u2032 nucleotides +77 to +150. As a result, (1) 3\u2032 NCR nucleotides \u201315 to \u201367 remain available to form a 3\u2032 cis stem and loop structure, a truncated 3\u2032 SL composed of nucleotides previously comprising the top portion of the long stem and including the distal loop regions (Fig. 6), and (2) 5\u2032 NCR nucleotides +1 to +44 and +53 to +76 are available in cis to form short stem\u2013loop structures, conserving part of the 5\u2032 SL predicted by Brinton and Dispoto (1988) (Fig. 7), including its distal loop. Therefore, the distal loop in the 5\u2032 NCR could still form. The pseudoknot predicted by Shi et al. (1996a) and involving a portion of the 3\u2032 SL conserved in the 5\u2032\u29f83\u2032 panhandle structure could also still form, as the semiconserved nucleotides that form the loop atop the short stem in the conventional model of the 3\u2032 SL secondary structure (5\u2032-CANAG-3\u2032; Fig. 6) are available for hydrogen bonding with the conserved remnant of the long SL in the model proposed by Khromykh and co-workers (2001). It is worthy to note that the predicted thermal stability of the panhandle exceeds those of the earlier predicted 5\u2032 SL and 3\u2032 SL by a wide margin. In addition, the predicted thermal stability of mutant KUN RNA 5\u2032\u29f83\u2032 hydrogen-bonded complexes that lacked complementary cyclization sequences was very little different from that of the wild-type complex. This suggests that the requirement for the cyclization sequences relates to their specific functional necessity, e.g., in initiation of RNA synthesis or translation or packaging, rather than to their additive effect on thermal stability of the panhandle. One must view all of these hypotheses for base pairing with an open mind for two reasons: (1) Computer power to predict folding and base pairing in nucleic acids is increasing rapidly and therefore any of these hypotheses are subject to evolution based on the state of the art in computer programs and computer power and (2) the \u201cwild card\u201d in any computer-based prediction is the unknown but certain effect of cellular and possibly viral proteins on the secondary and tertiary structure of the RNA.",

They then used a second program to detect compensatory mutations (meaning mutations in both strands of a base-paired region that conserve hydrogen bonding) in the 3\u2032 NCRs of related viruses. The presence of compensatory mutations was taken as an indication that the base pairing in that region was likely to occur in vivo, as random mutational events conserved the double strandedness.",

Region I consisted of nucleotides upstream from CS1, CS2, and RCS2 in mosquito-borne virus genomes or the 5\u2032-most extreme of the core element in tick-borne virus genomes. This is a region of high variability in linear nucleotide sequences. However, all flavivirus sequences in region I formed very similar long hairpin structures with a branching stem\u2013loop side structure or, in some cases, a bulge\u2013loop on the 5\u2032 side of the main hairpin. Downstream from this long hairpin in region I was a conserved shorter hairpin of similar configuration. Nucleotides in region II included those assigned to the CS2 and RCS2 boxes plus intervening sequences. Unlike region I, where a single consensus secondary structure was predicted, region II nucleotides exhibited differences in folding patterns that separated the viruses into three groups: (1) DEN and JE subgroup viruses, (2) tick-borne viruses, and (3) YF virus. Region II in genomes of viruses in the DEN and JE subgroups was shown to contain tandem repeat sequences (TL1 and TL2; Fig. 4) that potentially form conserved short SL structures. TL1 is located upstream from RCS2, and TL2 is located between RCS2 and CS2. The secondary structures in region II for tick-borne viruses were so different from those predicted for mosquito-borne viruses that no one element was conserved between the two groups. Region III consisted of nucleotides traditionally believed to constitute CS-1 and the 3\u2032 SL. A 3\u2032-terminal SL structure was predicted by this analysis, just as it was predicted by the MFOLD program used by Khromykh et al. (2001). As in the Khromykh model for panhandle formation, the length of the long stem at the genome 3\u2032 terminus in the Proutski model (Proutski et al., 1997b) is shorter than that predicted by older methods due to the alternative hydrogen bonding of nucleotides that form the lower portion of the long stem shown in Fig. 6. The Khromykh model (Khromykh et al., 2001) and predictions for the secondary structure within the 3\u2032 NCR put forward by Proutski and colleagues (1997b) are not incompatible if one posits that sequences not included in the 3\u2032 SL in the Proutski model are base paired with nucleotides of the 5\u2032 NCR.",

An association between secondary structure of the 3\u2032 NCR and virus virulence was claimed in that all wild strain genomes were likely to fold similarly and in a significantly different way from the attenuated vaccine strains. In addition, strain 17DD had an intermediate folding pattern that was less different from that of wild strain genomes than was the strain 17D-204 3\u2032 NCR. The authors noted that strain 17DD is more virulent in mice than strain 17D-204 and suggested that mutagenesis of the primary nucleotide sequence of the 3\u2032 NCR to alter the secondary structure could be a useful strategy for vaccine development. The point may be well taken with respect to mice, but after more than 60 years of experience, there is no indication that the strain 17DD vaccine is any less attenuated in humans than is the strain 17D-204 vaccine (Monath, 1999).",

This program yielded a set of suboptimal structure predictions, which were then checked manually for the presence of pseudoknots and for phylogenetic consistency. The analyses confirmed the presence of conserved serogroup-specific secondary structures for each of the four serogroups in the 3\u2032 NCR upstream from the 3\u2032 SL. As in the work of Proutski and colleagues (1997b), the existence of conserved SL structures that involved CS2 and RCS2 was confirmed for viruses of the DEN and JE subgroups. These were paired \u201cdumbbell\u201d-shaped structures that included the conserved stem and the respective TL1 and TL2 loop sequences identified previously. Olsthoorn and Bol (2001) proposed that TL1 and TL2 loops could each form pseudoknots by hydrogen bonding with conserved tetranucleotide sequences pk1 and pk2 present in predicted linear regions of the DEN and JE subgroup 3\u2032 NCRs. For example, in the DEN serogroup, nucleotides in the TL1 sequence (5\u2032-GAAGCUGUA-3\u2032; Fig. 4), which forms a loop within a secondary structure that includes CS2, could form hydrogen bonds (bold letters in the TL1 sequence) with conserved sequence pk1 (5\u2032-ACAGC-3\u2032), which lies downstream from CS2. Similarly, in the upstream dumbbell-shaped secondary structure that includes RCS2, the nucleotides 5\u2032-GCUGC-3\u2032 in TL2 could hydrogen bond with linear sequence pk2 (5\u2032-GCAGC-3\u2032), which also lies between RCS2 and CS2. For JE serogroup viruses, pk1 and pk2 were both located downstream from CS2. In the YF genomes, which lack RCS2 (Fig. 2), three pseudoknots were predicted, one of which was similar in its genesis to the more downstream pseudoknot in DEN and JE serogroup genomes. As in the analyses of Proutski et al. (1997a), the TBE genomes were folded very differently from those of the mosquito-borne viruses, resulting in the formation of a single predicted pseudoknot within the core element. The internally consistent results of this study and the compatibility of the results with the work of others (Proutski 1997a, Rauscher 1997) constitute additional evidence that pseudoknot formation may be required for proper function of the 3\u2032 NCR in flavivirus RNA replication.",

Replication is thought to occur by a semiconservative mechanism requiring double-stranded replicative form RNA to generate replicative intermediate RNA containing nascent single strands. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs must play a role in the initiation of negative-strand synthesis on virus RNA released from entering virions, switching from negative-strand synthesis to synthesis of progeny plus strand RNA at late times after infection, and possibly in the initiation of translation and in the packaging of virus plus strand RNA into particles. However, none of these mechanisms is as yet well defined. The presence of conserved and nonconserved complementary nucleotide sequences near the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of flavivirus genomes suggests that \u201cpanhandle\u201d or circular RNA structures are formed transiently by hydrogen bonding at some stage during RNA replication.",

However, a few such features are conserved in all flavivirus genomes. These are as follows: (1) All vector-borne flavivirus genomes begin with the dinucleotide sequence 5\u2032-AG and end with the complementary nucleotide sequence UC-3\u2032. The functional significance of these sequences is not known but may play a role in cyclization of the genome during or as a prerequisite for replication. (2) While the nucleotide sequence of the 5\u2032NCR is not well conserved among flavivirus species, the 5\u2032NCRs of all flavivirus genomes do contain a predicted stable stem and loop structure. (3) All flavivirus genomes contain a 3\u2032-terminal approximately 100-nucleotide sequence that is predicted to form a highly stable stem and loop structure, the 3\u2032 SL. The actual nucleotide sequence of this domain is well conserved among viruses of the same subgroup but is much less well conserved across subgroups. The 3\u2032 SL is known to bind the virus-coded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein NS5 and to be required for binding of a virus-coded helicase, NS3, to the 3\u2032NCR. In addition, the 3\u2032 SL apparently binds several cellular proteins required for virus replication. One of these proteins has been identified as the translation elongation factor eF1-\u03b1. Mutations of the 3\u2032 SL can be shown to affect the host range of the virus, suggesting that binding of host cell proteins is critically important for replication. (4) Within the nucleotide sequence forming the distal loop of the 3\u2032 SL in all vector-borne flavivirus genomes, there is a conserved nucleotide sequence, 5\u2032-CACAG. The function of this conserved pentanucleotide sequence in replication is unknown.",

The other is located in the 5\u2032 terminus of the long ORF, just downstream from the start codon that initiates translation of the capsid protein gene segment, referred to as the \u201c5\u2032CS.\u201d The CYC sequence and the 5\u2032CS are thought to hydrogen bond, helping to form a panhandle structure during RNA replication. Tick-borne flavivirus genomes contain two analogous pairs of 5\u2032\u29f83\u2032 complementary sequences, each 11 nucleotides in length. The 3\u2032-terminal motifs in tick-borne virus genomes are herein referred to as C1\u2032 and C2\u2032, and the 5\u2032-terminal motifs are referred to as C1 and C2.

The start codon for translation of a very short ORF in the 5\u2032 NCR is represented by a single upward vertical tick, numbered one (1); the start codon for translation of the long ORF in TBE genomes is represented by an upward tick, numbered two (2). Stop codons for the short ORF in the 5\u2032 NCR and for the long ORF at the 5\u2032 end of the 3\u2032 NCR are indicated by a downward vertical tick. Four of six different possible nucleotide sequence motifs for 3\u2032 NCRs of TBE viruses are indicated on the right as horizontal lines (adapted from Wallner et al., 1995). Motif A, strains Neudorfl and 263; B, strain Ljubljana I; C, strain 132; and D, strain RK1424. The flavivirus-conserved 3\u2032 stem and loop structure is indicated by a loop in the horizontal line and is labeled \u201cSL.\u201d The location of the restriction endonuclease site AgeI in TBE genomic DNA is indicated by an arrow defining the boundary between the variable region and the core element in the strain Neudorfl 3\u2032 NCR. Black boxes indicate the relative locations of cyclization sequences C1 and C2 in the 5\u2032 NCR and C1\u2032 and C2\u2032 in the 3\u2032 NCR. Relative locations of TBE virus\u2013conserved repeat sequences R1, R1\u2032, R2, and R3 in the 3\u2032 NCR are indicated by cross-hatched or stippled boxes. IR, conserved inverted repeat. PU\u29f8PY\u29f8PR, conserved homopurine, pyrimidine, and purine-rich segments in 3\u2032 NCR RNA, respectively. Dotted lines indicate the locations of deletions in the genomes of some TBE strains relative to the motif found in strain Neudorfl RNA. The notation \u201cAAAn\u201d indicates the location of a poly(A)tract in the strains Neudorfl, 263, and 132 genomes.
