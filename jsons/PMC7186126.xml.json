This drug was used initially for a similar purpose with great success, by Convit, Soto and Sheskin to allay reactional phenomena in reactional lepromatous leprosy.1 We (Goihman-Yahr, Requena, Vallecalle-Suegart and Convit) used thalidomide in experimental autoimmune diseases of the rat.2 We found that the drug administered intragastrically in rats was effective in preventing and treating \u201cdistant lesions\u201d of adjuvant disease. Namely, arthritis, vasculitis of the skin and iridocyclitis; as well as loss of weight and wasting. It was NOT effective in treating or preventing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis or experimental allergic neuritis. We (Goihman-Yahr, Rodriguez-Ochoa, Aranzazu and Convit) also found that peripheral blood neutrophils were activated in reactional lepromatous leprosy, but not in other forms of leprosy. This was not due to anergy of neutrophils in non reactional leprosy.3\n",

The possible side effects of thalidomide are detailedly covered in Martindale's, \u201cThe Complete Drug Reference\u201d4 but most of them occur in patients with complex pathologies including malignant neoplasia. In my long term clinical experience with the drug, the only frequent side effect besides sleepiness, is alteration in peripheral nerve conduction with prolonged administration.",
