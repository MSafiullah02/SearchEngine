With the discovery of blood group antigens in 1901, by Karl Landsteiner, transfusion therapy changed from a hazardous proposition to a relatively safe procedure [2]. During the last decade, the scenario of transfusion medicine has changed dramatically; with the advancement of technology, safety from transfusion transmitted disease has improved. Emphasis is also given on the use of specific blood components. However, the incidence of human-related adverse events, ABO incompatibility, alloimmunization, bacterial contamination, and immunomodulation phenomena are still a matter of concern [3].",
