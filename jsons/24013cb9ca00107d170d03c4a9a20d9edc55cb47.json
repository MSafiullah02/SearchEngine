In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. It has subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in terms of air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus's propagation, by short-range droplet transmission as well as likely by long-range aerosol (airborne) transmission.",

These particles can remain suspended in the air for longer periods of time and can reach a longer distance from the origin 6 .

This spatial configuration represents the well-known North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) 23, 24 in its positive phase, which is the teleconnection pattern linked to dry conditions in southern Europe whereas the opposite occurs in northern Europe 25 . Figure 2 and Figure S2 show maps for February 2020 for several meteorological fields that provide clear evidence of the stable atmospheric circulation in southern Europe, with a tendency towards very dry (i.e., lack of precipitation) and calm conditions. As suggested in an earlier analysis 18 , the SARS-CoV-2 virus seems to be transmitted most effectively in dry conditions with daily mean air temperatures between around 5\u00baC and 11\u00baC, which are the conditions shown in Figure 2 for the major part of Italy and Spain. By contrast, northern Europe has experienced mainly wet and windy conditions due to an anomalous strong westerly circulation that is linked to rainy conditions. These spatial patterns fit with the well-known climate features associated over Europe during positive phases of the NAO 26 .",

Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was already in Europe in early 2020, but it may only have started to extend rapidly when suitable atmospheric conditions for its spread were reached.

Figure 3 (top) shows that there is a statistically significant (R 2 =0.481, p<0.05) second order polynomial fit between the anomalies of the 500 hPa and the total cases per population. Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, which are the only countries with more than 1,000 cases/million inhabitants in our dataset, clustered together in regions with very large positive anomalies of 500 hPa geopotential heights. For the total number of deaths the fit is also statistically significant for a second order polynomial regression (R 2 =0.50, p<0.05), and it shows clearly how Italy and Spain are out of scale compared to the rest of the European countries.

To test this hypothesis further we have also analyzed the COVID-19 and meteorological data within Spain (see Data and Methods, Figure S5 ). The results show that mean temperature and specific humidity variables have the strong relation with COVID and fit with an exponential function ( Figure   4 ). They indicate that lower mean temperatures (i.e., average of around 8-11\u00baC) and lower specific humidity (e.g., <6 g/Kg) conditions are related to a higher number of cases and deaths in Spain. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that both meteorological variables are highly correlated (R 2 =0.838, p<0.05) and are not independent of each other. The temperatures as low as 8-10\u00baC are only reached in a few regions such as Madrid, Navarra, La Rioja, Aragon, Castille and Leon and Castilla-La Mancha. These areas are mainly located in inland Spain where drier conditions were reported the weeks before the outbreak.",

In addition, higher levels of humidity also limit the impact of the disease, and therefore the coastal areas seem to benefit from lower rates of infection. Thus, in the southern regions of Spain (all of them with more than 13\u00baC and higher levels of specific humidity) we found lower rates of infection and deceases. This is in line with the spatial pattern in Italy, with the most (least) affected regions by COVID-19 mainly located in the North (South).

The excess-mortality rates across Europe in the 1918 flu also showed a clear northsouth gradient, with a higher mortality in southern European countries (i.e., Portugal, Spain or Italy) as compared to northern regions, an aspect that is not explained by socio-economic or health factors 30 . In Spain, a south-north gradient is also reported in the 1918 flu after controlling for demographic factors 31 . The central and northern regions of Spain experienced higher rates of mortality, and this has been suggested to be linked to more favorable climate conditions for influenza transmission as compared to the southern regions 31 . Interestingly, the SLP anomalies of the months before the major wave of this pandemic (which occurred in October-November 1918) shows a clear south-north dipole with positive anomalies in southern Europe centered over the Mediterranean, and negative ones in northern Europe ( Figure S6 ). In other words, the NAO was also in its positive phase just before the major outbreak of the 1918 influenza pandemic. This resembles the spatial patterns described above for the current COVID-19 outbreak, both in terms of the spatial distribution of the mortality of the pandemic over Europe as well as in prevailing atmospheric circulation conditions before the major outbreak. These intriguing coincidences need further research in order to better understand the spatial and temporal distribution of large respiratory-origin pandemics over Europe.",

Taking into consideration current evidences in the literature, it seems that suitable conditions of air temperature and humidity were reached in Northern Italy and inland Spain. Indeed, meteorological conditions can affect the susceptibility of an infected host by altering the mucosal antiviral defense 32 and the stability and transmission of the virus 33 , as well as social contact patterns 34 . We also hypothesize that the anomalous meteorological conditions experienced in Italy and Spain promoted the airborne contagion both indoors and outdoors, in addition to the direct and indirect contact and short-range droplets, which helped to speed up the rates of effective reproductive number (R) of the virus ( Figure S7 ). Equally, the anticyclonic conditions, amplified in some areas by temperature inversions, may have reduced the dispersion of the virus outdoors. This stability and lack of precipitation can also produce more processes of suspension and resuspension of the infected aerosols indoors and, especially, outdoors, in a similar way as resuspension of anthropogenic pollutants in cities 35, 36 . Equally, it is also suggested that high atmospheric pollutant concentrations can be positively related to increase fatalities related to respiratory virus infections 37, 38 and even COVID-19 39 . This is a relevant issue as the main hotspot of COVID-19 in Italy is located in the Po valley, one of the most polluted regions of Europe, as well as the Madrid region (the most affected region so far in Spain) 40 .",

The maps and data have been retrieved by using the tools and websites referenced in the main text, and more details about the spatial and temporal resolution, vertical levels, assimilation schemes, etc. can be consulted in their references. In brief, an atmospheric reanalysis like those used here is a climate data assimilation project which aims to assimilate historical atmospheric observational data spanning an extended period, using a single consistent assimilation scheme throughout, with the aim of providing continuous gridded data for the whole globe. Figure S4 . Location of the 15 countries used in this study that provided cases and deaths of COVID-19. Figure S5 . Location of the autonomous communities of Spain, as well as the two autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The Canary Islands has not been included in this study due to its geographical location in tropical latitudes. Figure S7 . Schematic representation of particles emitted by a cough, with the large droplets settled down nearby (e.g., 1 m distance) and the smaller airborne particles spreading in suspension for longer time, and reaching longer distances, especially in dry and stable conditions as compared to wet environments. It is also possible that a resuspension of aerosol particles can eventually happen due to human activities (e.g., walking, cleaning, etc.) or air flows, which is enhanced under dry conditions due to the lack of precipitation. Only statistically significant fields (p<0.05) are plotted as estimated by a Student's t-Test. Map composed with the data and tools provided by the KNMI Climate Explorer website (https://climexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi). The maps show a consistent picture of an intensification of the positive NAO phase, which implies that in the future winter conditions as experienced over Europe past February 2020 could become more common.",

            "text": "political, social, economic and environmental factors, with complex and non-linear interrelationships between them, the results of this study indicate that an anomalous atmospheric circulation may explain why the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe developed more easily (or faster) in the south-west (mainly north of Italy and inland of Spain). Specifically, the extreme positive phase of the AO and NAO during February 2020 could have modulated the beginning of the major outbreaks of COVID-19 in Europe. This detected anomalous atmospheric pattern, which produces dry conditions over southwestern Europe, may have provided optimal meteorological conditions for the virus propagation. In the context of anthropogenic climate change, it has been shown that in future emissions scenarios a poleward expansion of the Hadley cell is expected 41 , which in turn is in line with a tendency to increase the frequency of positive phases of the NAO 42 (Figure S8). This should be taken into account for planning against future epidemics and pandemics that arise from respiratory viruses. Interestingly, the conditions during the last major pandemic experienced in Europe (the Spanish flu in 1918), seem to resemble the current spatial pattern of affectation with more cases in the South of Europe as compared to the North. Equally, the dominant atmospheric situation was strongly affected by anticyclonic (cyclonic) conditions in the South (North) of Europe. Further research is needed in order to better understand the spatio-temporal patterns of large epidemic and pandemic situations, and their connection with the prevailing atmospheric conditions patterns. 42.

Data from Spain on regional scale were obtained on March 28 th , 2020 from the Spanish Government through the Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII): https://covid19.isciii.es/ For the link between the COVID-19 spread on European scale and atmospheric circulation we have extracted the monthly anomalies of sea level pressure (SLP) and 500 hPa geopotential height for February 2020 over each grid point of the 15 capitals of the European countries. We have selected the SLP and 500 hPa fields in order to summarize the meteorological conditions over each location, as it is known that several meteorological variables can be involved in the transmission of respiratory viruses 4,5 . With this approach we also avoid the lack of properly updated data for all potential meteorological variables involved in the COVID-19 spread, which needs further research as soon as the pandemic ends and a more reliable and complete database of both COVID-19 impact and meteorological data can be compiled 6 .For Spain, several meteorological variables with high-quality records were obtained from the Spanish Meteorology Agency (AEMET) based on surface observations for each of the capital cities of the provinces inside each autonomous region. Specifically, monthly averages for February 2020 of 2-m temperature, 2-m maximum temperature, 2-m minimum temperature (\u00b0C), air pressure (hPa), wind speed (km h \u22121 ), specific humidity (g Kg -1 ), relative humidity (%), total precipitation (mm) and days of more than 1 mm of precipitation.
