Generation of Ang II occurs in two enzymatic steps. The aspartyl protease renin, which is produced by specialized juxtaglomerular smooth muscle cells in the kidneys in response to reduced renal perfusion pressure or salt depletion, catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction. By splitting a Leu-Val peptide bond in humans or a Leu-Leu bond in other species, it releases the final ten N-terminal amino acids from its only known substrate, angiotensinogen (AGT). AGT is a liver-derived \u03b1 2 -globulin that belongs to the family of serine-protease inhibitors (serpines), and its concentration is the major determinant of systemic renin activity. The peptide fragment resulting from cleavage of AGT, Ang I, is the inactive precursor of Ang II. Ang II is generated by cleavage of two C-terminal amino acids (His-Leu) from Ang I by the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that is anchored to the luminal surface of the endothelium as a transmembranous ectoenzyme and is particularly abundant in the pulmonary vasculature (Caldwell et al. 1976 Recent advances in the metabolism of angiotensin peptides have revealed novel functional peptides, which challenge the view of Ang II as the primary effector of the RAS (Figure 5 .1). Aminopeptidase A can split off Asp from Ang II, yielding the less potent vasoconstrictor Ang III (Ang 2-8), which can further be transformed to Ang IV (Ang 3-8) by aminopeptidase N. Another angiotensin peptide, Ang 1-7, which is derived either directly from Ang I by tissue-endopeptidases or from Ang II by ACE2, acts as a vasodilator (Ferrario and Iyer 1998) . ACE2 is an ACE homologue that acts as a carboxypeptidase by selectively removing the C-terminal Phe from Ang II. Through its contribution to Ang II degradation as well as Ang 1-7 generation, ACE2 has received much attention as an opposing factor of Ang II action. To highlight the heterogeneous functions of the various RAS components, ACE2 has also been recognized as a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus, mediating its cell intrusion (Kuhn et al. 2004 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 252, "text": "(Braun-Menendez et al. 1940;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 253, "end": 274, "text": "Page and Helmer 1940)", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1344, "text": "(Caldwell et al. 1976", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1888, "text": "(Ferrario and Iyer 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2354, "text": "(Kuhn et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1514, "end": 1523, "text": "(Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The vascular wall possesses the ability to independently generate Ang II, suggesting local paracrine/autocrine functions of Ang II. Except for renin, all components of the RAS have been found in the vascular wall. The rate-limiting step of local Ang II generation is the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, which can be catalyzed by a number of enzymes in addition to ACE, namely, chymase, cathepsin G, and chymostatinsensitive Ang II-generating enzyme (CAGE) . Several reninlike enzymes that release Ang I from AGT, such as cathepsin D, tonins, tissue plasminogen activator, and other aspartyl proteases, have been proposed as a means to mediate the local RAS independent of kidney-derived renin. While there is no convincing evidence for local synthesis of renin (Hilgers et al. 2001) , tissue levels of renin become undetectable within 48 hours after bilateral nephrectomy (Thurston et al. 1979) . This suggests accumulation of renin in tissues. Renin uptake into cardiovascular tissues has been reported to result in sustained Ang II effects in local vascular beds (M\u00fcller et al. 1998 ). Furthermore, a functional renin receptor has recently been found on mesangial cells that enhances the catalytic activity of renin upon binding (Nguyen et al. 2002) . This receptor specifically binds renin and its precursor prorenin, which may explain why local concentrations of renin (e.g., in interstitial fluid) are oftentimes higher than predicted by simple diffusion from the plasma (Danser et al. 1994 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 448, "end": 454, "text": "(CAGE)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 760, "end": 781, "text": "(Hilgers et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 871, "end": 893, "text": "(Thurston et al. 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1083, "text": "(M\u00fcller et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1250, "text": "(Nguyen et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1475, "end": 1494, "text": "(Danser et al. 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Local Tissue RAS"}, {"text": "The cellular effects of Ang II are mediated by distinct high-affinity cell surface receptors.

Several reports show that Ang II has effects on endothelial cells, but not always do they seem to be mediated by known Ang II receptors (Vaughan et al. 1995) . Aside from rodent endothelial cells, which clearly express AT 1A Rs, AT 1 Rs have also been found on bovine and porcine endothelial cells. In primary cultured human arterial umbilical endothelial cells, AT 1 Rs have been detected by binding studies; however, the receptors rapidly disappear in vitro. Interestingly, a low-affinity binding site persists even in later cell passages, which is not inhibitable by specific receptor blockers (Ko et al. 1997 ).

The AT 1 R has 359 amino acids (MW \u223c50 kDa). Structurally, it consists of four extracellular (N-terminus and three connecting loops), four intracellular (three connecting loops and C-terminus), and seven \u03b1-helical transmembrane domains. Extracellular glycosylation sites are in the N-terminus (Asn 4 ) and the second extracellular loop (Asp 176 and Asn 188 ) (Desarnaud et al. 1993) . Two disulfide bonds between extracellular loops one and two and between extracellular loop three and the N-terminus stabilize the tertiary structure of the receptor. The N-terminus as well as the first and third extracellular loops contain the epitopes for peptide binding. The binding of nonpeptide antagonists is independent from these epitopes, suggesting distinct modes of interaction for peptide and nonpeptide ligands (Hjorth et al. 1994) . Several conserved residues, Asp 74 , Tyr 215 , and Tyr 292 , are important in G-protein binding and activation (Marie et al. 1994) . The cytoplasmic tail can be phosphorylated in the basal and Ang IIstimulated state at its numerous Ser and Thr residues, but also at the few Tyr residues at positions 302, 312, 319, and 339 (Kai et al. 1994 ). Among these the Asp-Pro-Leu-Phe-Tyr (NPLFY 302 ) sequence is a variant of the highly conserved tyrosinecontaining NPXY motif found in the cytoplasmic tail of many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), in which it is linked to coated pit-mediated receptor internalization. However, in the AT 1 R the NPLFY motif is not linked to receptor internalization. Instead, the extra Phe 301 seems to be important for agonist binding (Hunyady et al. 1995) . Tyr 319 is also part of a functionally important motif: YIPP. This sequence is similar to motifs in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), which, when phosphorylated, are important in SH2-domain coupling to those receptors. In the AT 1 R, Tyr 319 mediates interaction with JAK2 (Ali et al. 1997) , a member of the Janus family kinases (JAK), and is also important for EGF-R transactivation. The human AGTR1 is located on chromosome 3q21-25 and spans about 60 kb, including five exons and four introns. Exon sizes range from 59 to 2014 bp with exon 5 being the largest and the only coding exon, while the first four exons encode the 5 untranslated region (UTR) (Guo et al. 1994) . Several splice variants with different exon composition have been described. The open reading frame of the AGTR1 spans 1080 bp. AGTR1 polymorphisms have been described as a potential link to vascular morbidity. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A1166C in the 3 UTR is more common in hypertensive patients than normotensive controls (Bonnardeaux et al. 1994 ). In addition, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who are homozygous for the A1166C mutated allele (CC genotype) have increased AT 1 R sensitivity (van Geel et al. 2000) . Some other SNPs in the AGTR1 have been implicated in the genetics of hypertension, but much work needs to be done to evaluate the association of other AGTR1 SNPs with cardiovascular disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 561, "end": 584, "text": "(Desarnaud et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1031, "text": "(Hjorth et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1164, "text": "(Marie et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1373, "text": "(Kai et al. 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1817, "text": "(Hunyady et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2158, "end": 2175, "text": "(Ali et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2540, "end": 2557, "text": "(Guo et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2899, "end": 2923, "text": "(Bonnardeaux et al. 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3081, "end": 3103, "text": "(van Geel et al. 2000)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Structure and Genomics"}, {"text": "The density of Ang II receptors on VSMCs is a central determinant of the cellular sensitivity to Ang II. Thus, factors that regulate AGTR1 expression have a marked effect on cardiovascular function. Among these are cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and vasoactive agents (Table 5 .1). In vascular tissues, chronic Ang II exposure itself induces downregulation of the AT 1 R in a negative feedback fashion (Nickenig et al. 2000) . Both mRNA and protein are significantly downregulated after 2-6 hours of Ang II exposure in vitro (Lassegue et al. 1995) and in vivo (Gunther et al. 1980) . Various pathophysiological conditions affect AT 1 R regulation. For example, hypercholesterolemia leads to AT 1 R overexpression . This may explain why hyperlipidemia is frequently associated with hypertension. Intriguingly, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which has been linked to early atherosclerotic events, increases AT 1 R expression on endothelial cells (Li et al. 2000) , but in contrast to unmodified LDL, it does not affect AT 1 R expression on VSMCs (Nickenig et al. 1997 ). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), which are potent cholesterol-lowering drugs, have been shown to reduce AT 1 R expression by reducing the half-life of AT 1 R mRNA. This mechanism is dependent on their inhibitory effect on geranylgeranylation and may therefore explain lipid-lowering independent (pleiotropic) effects of statins on the vasculature (Wassmann et al. 2001) . Proinflammatory cytokines increase AT 1 R expression in vascular tissues (Sasamura et al. 1997) , whereas nitric oxide (NO) downregulates AGTR1 transcription (Ichiki et al. 1998 ). Stability of AT 1 R mRNA depends on specific binding motifs for polysomal proteins in the 3 UTR immediately upstream of the polyadenylation tract (Nickenig et al. 2001 ). There are two putative polyadenylation sites in the 3 UTR as well as six AUUUA motifs (Furuta et al. 1992) . Mutation of the AU-rich element (3 UTR 2159-2175) decreases AT 1 R mRNA decay, while AU-repeat mRNAbinding proteins promote AT 1 R mRNA destabilization. In addition to the primary base composition, the secondary structure of the mRNA, displaying a stem-loop sequence, seems to be necessary for interaction with degrading mRNA-binding proteins (Berger et al. 2005) . Moreover, the 5 UTR sequence has been found to be involved in posttranscriptional regulation. Although in all known splice variants the open reading frame is not affected, variants in the 5 leader sequence contribute to tissue-specific changes in AGTR1 expression at least in part by altering rates of mRNA translation (Elton and Martin 2003; Zhang et al. 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 430, "text": "(Nickenig et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 531, "end": 553, "text": "(Lassegue et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 566, "end": 587, "text": "(Gunther et al. 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 961, "end": 977, "text": "(Li et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1082, "text": "(Nickenig et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1502, "text": "(Wassmann et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1600, "text": "(Sasamura et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1682, "text": "(Ichiki et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1853, "text": "(Nickenig et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1963, "text": "(Furuta et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2309, "end": 2329, "text": "(Berger et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2651, "end": 2674, "text": "(Elton and Martin 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2693, "text": "Zhang et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 282, "text": "(Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Regulation of Surface Expression"}, {"text": "Initiation of mRNA synthesis is another control point of AGTR1 expression.

Within 10 minutes, the receptor is internalized via clathrin-coated pits into endosomes. The intracellular Ang II/AT 1 R complex continues to signal until its inactivation, which occurs either by degradation after fusion with lysosomes or by dephosphorylation with subsequent recycling to the cell surface membrane (Hunyady et al. 2002) . Approximately 25% of the internalized receptors are recycled back to the cell membrane. Internalization and cellular processing of the Ang II/AT 1 R complex itself may have a specific role in signal transduction by engaging the complex with second messenger systems other than those at the cell membrane. The principal mechanism depends on Ser-and Thr-phosphorylation of the activated AT 1 R C-terminus mediated by G-protein-related kinases (GRKs). Phosphorylation in the region from Thr 332 to Ser 338 facilitates interaction with \u03b2-arrestins (Qian et al. 2001) , which impair further G-protein activation and subsequently promote receptor endocytosis (Kule et al. 2004 ). \u03b2-Arrestins recruit non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) like c-Src and other adapter proteins to the cell membrane to form complexes that orchestrate the internalization process (Fessart et al. 2005) . After receptor phosphorylation by GRKs 5/6, \u03b2-arrestins can direct signaling events toward the MAPK pathway independent of G-proteins (Kim et al. 2005b) . For instance, mutant AT 1 Rs incapable of G-protein coupling have been found to activate ERK via \u03b2-arrestin-2 (Wei et al. 2003) . Of interest, hypertension per se upregulates GRK5 in VSMCs in vivo, suggesting that modulation of GRK5 levels may be an adaptive cellular means to autoregulate Ang II sensitivity (Ishizaka et al. 1997) . After endocytosis, the AT 1 R remains tightly bound to \u03b2-arrestin and travels to an early sorting endosome, from which the complex fuses either to a lysosome or to a perinuclear recycling endosome . Sorting of the receptorligand complex between intracellular membrane organelles is an important trafficking mechanism. It has been shown that AT 1 Rs preferentially traffic to Rab5-positive endosomes (Seachrist et al. 2002) . Rab GTPases regulate intracellular vesicle transport and fusion. Furthermore, Rab5 and \u03b2-arrestin binding to the AT 1 R C-terminus appear to mediate retention of the complex in early endosomes, thereby preventing recycling and degradation (Dale et al. 2004 ).

Caveolae are special invaginated lipid rafts characterized by the presence of caveolin (Cav)-1, -2, and -3, which are of particular importance for Ang II signaling. Upon stimulation with Ang II, the AT 1 R rapidly (<2 min) translocates laterally to Cav-enriched membrane fractions, and directly interacts with Cav-1, promoting the assembly of a Cav scaffolding domain (Ishizaka et al. 1998) .

Some second messenger systems are activated within seconds, while others are delayed and persist for more than an hour (Griendling et al. 1986 ). Upon Ang II binding to VSMCs, the AT 1 R activates G-proteins of the pertussis toxin-insensitive subfamilies: G\u03b1 q and G\u03b1 12/13 . Within 30 sec of Ang II stimulation, a rapid and transient activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific membrane-bound phospholipase C (PLC)-\u03b21 leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol (DAG). G\u03b1 q/11 and G\u03b1 12 proteins as well as their respective G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits couple the AT 1 R with PLC-\u03b21 ( Figure 5 .2). Subsequently (\u226530 sec), PLC-\u03b3 activation accounts for the majority of IP 3 production. PLC-\u03b3 is activated in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner and returns to baseline activity in 10 min (Ushio-Fukai et al. 1998b) . Some evidence exists to suggest the NRTK Src as the responsible tyrosine kinase in this step (Haendeler et al. 2003) . IP 3 rapidly diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it binds to IP 3 receptors to release calcium (Ca 2+ ) into the cytosol. In addition to IP 3 -triggered release of Ca 2+ from intracellular Ca 2+ stores, sustained Ang II-induced vasoconstriction depends on transmembrane Ca 2+ influx (Ruan and Arendshorst 1996) . The production of the membrane-bound DAG by Ang II is biphasic. The initial peak at 15 sec results from hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by PLC, whereas the second phase, which has its maximum at 5 min, results from phospholipase D (PLD) activation. G\u03b1 12 and G\u03b2\u03b3 activate PLD through c-Src and RhoA-dependent mechanisms. PLD remains active for at least 1 hour, splitting phosphatidylcholine into choline and phosphatidic acid (PA) (Ushio-Fukai et al. 1999a) , which is subsequently converted to DAG. For this prolonged phase of DAG production, internalization of the ligandbound AT 1 R complex is required, implying that PLD activation occurs spatially separated from the plasma membrane. DAG, in conjunction with phosphatidylserine and Ca 2+ , subsequently activates protein kinase C (PKC). The early increase in intracellular Ca 2+ stimulates the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase to phosphorylate Ser 19 of the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) with subsequent VSMC contraction through MLC interaction with actin. This process is importantly modulated by the Ca 2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments, which is largely determined by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)-mediated inhibition of MLC phosphatase (Uehata et al. 1997 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 250, "text": "(Griendling et al. 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 918, "end": 944, "text": "(Ushio-Fukai et al. 1998b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1063, "text": "(Haendeler et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1389, "text": "(Ruan and Arendshorst 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1849, "text": "(Ushio-Fukai et al. 1999a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2633, "text": "(Uehata et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 717, "end": 725, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Contraction"}, {"text": "In addition, Ang II rapidly phosphorylates and activates PLA 2 to produce arachidonic acid (Rao et al. 1994) .

This is reflected by an increase in cell volume and protein content Geisterfer et al. 1988) , whereas a proliferative effect of Ang II has been found to be dependent on the cellular milieu (e.g., autocrine production of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 can suppress the hyperplastic response) (Gibbons et al. 1992) . Within 1 min of Ang II exposure, numerous cytosolic proteins have been found to be tyrosine phosphorylated (Molloy et al. 1993) . Furthermore, the growthpromoting effects of Ang II were found to be abrogated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors . It is now well accepted that Ang II rapidly activates the MAPK family, including c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK), also termed stress-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK, p42/44 MAPK )1/2, and p38 MAPK , which are considered upstream mediators of transcription factors involved in VSMC growth. ERK1/2 activation by Ang II, which can be blocked by PLC inhibition, intracellular Ca 2+ chelation, and tyrosine kinase inhibition, eventually proceeds through a Ras-dependent pathway (Eguchi et al. 1996) . One intermediate tyrosine kinase between AT 1 R and Ras is Src (Schieffer et al. 1996) . Growth factor receptors, which are typically RTKs such as EGF-R, characteristically propagate their signal to the small GTPase Ras via the GTP-exchange factor son of sevenless (SOS), which forms multimeric signaling complexes with the receptor and adapter proteins such as Grb2 and Shc. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that the atypical PKC-\u03b6 mediates Ang II activation of Ras, which seems to be a unique aspect of the Ang II-induced response as compared to other growth factors (Liao et al. 1997) . Ang II induces EGF-R activation by an intracellular Ca 2+ -and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism, which has been termed EGF-R transactivation (Eguchi et al. 1998; Ushio-Fukai et al. 2001) , and the EGF-R then acts as a scaffold, mediating a number of downstream signaling molecules including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and Akt. Src recruits another NRTK of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family, called proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk) 2, and after assembling a signaling complex, activates subtype ADAM17 of the a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family to release cell surface-bound EGF, which subsequently activates its receptor (Eguchi et al. 1999; Ohtsu et al. 2006; Prenzel et al. 1999) and Ras.

The resulting inflammatory gene products can be grossly subdivided into adhesion molecules, cytokines, and acute phase reactants. The prototypical Ang II-inducible transcription factors, such as AP-1, STATs, and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), are also known cytokine-inducible transcription factors. Ang II dose-dependently stimulates interleukin-6 (IL-6) production in cultured VSMC, which is accompanied by activation of NF-\u03baB.

Effects of Ang II outside of the vasculature include modulation of sympathetic tone and dipsogenic stimulation to maintain vegetative autoregulatory functions of the vasculature. In the adult vessel, VSMCs are present in the quiescent contractile phenotype until an insult triggers a change in phenotype. Ang II seems to mediate this transformation, which may be adaptive and beneficial in the short term, but in the long term sustains unfavorable and unstable vessel architecture prone to increase the likelihood for adverse clinical events.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Physiological Vascular Functions"}, {"text": "Patients with essential hypertension can be divided into subgroups with low and high plasma renin activity, with distinct pathophysiological features. Low-renin or renin-independent hypertension is characterized by salt-sensitivity, good response to diuretics, and familial aggregation (Fisher et al. 2002) . Blockage of the RAS is most effective in hypertensives with high plasma renin activity, whereas it has only limited effectiveness in low-renin states. Patients with hypertension have a multitude of structural and functional disturbances affecting all compartments and cell types of the vascular wall. In particular, increased media thickness has been consistently found in vessels of hypertensive animals and can be attenuated by Ang II inhibition (Rizzoni et al. 1998 ). This increased media thickness is due in part to hypertrophy of the VSMCs themselves, but also to an increased production of extracellular matrix (Lee 1987) . As described above, Ang II has the potential to increase both of these components by its effects on VSMC growth and synthetic capacity (Figure 5.4) . In addition to these trophic effects on the vessel wall implicated in chronic hypertension, prolonged contraction of resistance arteries (as illustrated above for the RGS \u00b7\u2212 2 mouse) and endothelial dysfunction are additional mechanisms of hypertension linked to RAS activity. Ang II-induced O \u00b7\u2212 2 from VSMC Nox enzymes reacts with endothelial-derived NO leading to impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation (Rajagopalan et al. 1996) . Aside from the vessel wall, Ang II also activates Noxes in various other tissues.

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study showed that hypertensive patients are much more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (DM2) than their normotensive peers (Gress et al. 2000) . Intriguingly, inhibition of the RAS appears to reduce new onset of DM2 (Yusuf et al. 2000) , suggesting a role for Ang II in insulin resistance. Furthermore, diabetic patients benefit overproportionally from RAS inhibition as these agents reduce diabetic nephropathy as well as microvascular and macrovascular complications. Aside from direct functions of Ang II on the endocrine pancreas like control of local blood flow, hormone release, and prostaglandin synthesis, there is substantial evidence that Ang II cross-talks to insulin signaling in VSMCs. Interplay of these two important hormones at the level of VSMCs is an attractive hypothesis for accelerated atherosclerosis found in patients with DM2 or insulin resistance. Observations made in vitro suggest that Ang II stimulation of VSMCs leads to serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1, which has been implicated in its premature degradation (Taniyama et al. 2005) . Of note, Ang II modulates insulin signaling at multiple levels by serine phosphorylating not only insulin receptor substrate-1, but also the insulin receptor and PI3-K (Folli et al. 1997 ). In addition, Ang II downregulates the vascular expression of PPAR\u03b3s (Tham et al. 2002) , which are nuclear hormonal receptors and transcription factors that promote beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and atherosclerosis development. Moreover, they exhibit anti-inflammatory properties by negatively modulating inflammatory gene expression. It is noteworthy that certain ARBs have been shown to directly and AT 1 R-independently activate PPAR\u03b3s in adipocytes, which has been suggested as a mechanism for the insulinsensitizing/antidiabetic effect of certain ARBs (Schupp et al. 2004 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 359, "end": 378, "text": "(Gress et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 452, "end": 471, "text": "(Yusuf et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1323, "text": "(Taniyama et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1512, "text": "(Folli et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1602, "text": "(Tham et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2123, "text": "(Schupp et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Metabolic Syndrome/Insulin Resistance"}, {"text": "The development of atherosclerotic lesions involves migration and proliferation of VSMCs. Essentially all of the above-mentioned chronic effects of Ang II on the vasculature are therefore considered atherogenic. While the initiating event for atherogenesis remains elusive, it is clear that a subsequent change in VSMC phenotype maintains disease progression. As opposed to the concentric medial thickening observed in hypertension, atherosclerosis results from the buildup of focal or diffuse lipid-laden and fibroproliferative plaques in the vessel intima with subsequent narrowing of the vessel lumen. Prior to formation of a plaque, endothelial dysfunction and upregulation of adhesion molecules occurs in atherosclerosis-prone vascular segments (Nakashima et al. 1998) . Ang II induces expression of adhesion molecules promoting monocyte invasion into the vasculature. In addition, Ang II not only induces expression of the oxLDL receptor (LOX-1) on macrophages with subsequent macrophage activation, but it also provides the basis for LDL oxidation by stimulating the production of ROS by VSMCs . Not surprisingly, Ang II infusion into apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice significantly enhances atherosclerotic lesion progression independent of its effect on blood pressure (Weiss et al. 2001) .
