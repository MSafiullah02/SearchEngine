            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in cancellation of postgraduate courses and the vast majority of elective surgery. Plastic surgery trainees and their trainers have therefore needed to pursue alternative means of training. In the face of cross-speciality cover and redeployment there is an additional demand for COVID-19 specific education. The Joint Committee on Surgical Training (JCST) Quality Indicators for Higher Surgical Training (HST) in Plastic Surgery state that trainees should have at least 2 hours of facilitated formal teaching each week.1 Social distancing requirements have meant that innovative ways of delivering this teaching have needed to be found. A seminar is a form of academic instruction based on the Socratic dialogue of asking and answering questions, with the word originating from the Latin word seminarium meaning \"seed plot\u201d.2 Fast and reliable internet and the ubiquitous nature of webcams has led to the evolution of the seminar into the webinar. Whilst webinars have been common place for a number of years, they represent an innovative and indispensable tool for remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, where trainees can interact and ask questions to facilitate deep and meaningful learning.",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a shift to social media; with people seeking constant updates and information from public figures, brands and organisations alike. Surgical education has mirrored this trend, and we have increasingly observed that webinars are being launched through speciality and trainee association social channels to keep up with the fast-paced demand for accessible online content. The aim of this study was to audit cumulative compliance of active publicly accessible postgraduate plastic surgery training webinar frequency and duration against JCST Quality Indicators.",

This tool monitors social media platforms for selected \u2018keywords\u2019 and provides analysis of search results. We used the search terms \u201cPlastic Surgery Webinar\u201d, \u201cReconstructive Surgery Webinar\u201d, \u201cRoyal College of Surgeons\u201d, \u201cBAPRAS\u201d, \u201cBSSH\u201d, \u201cBritish Burns Association\u201d, \u201cPLASTA\u201d and \u201cBSSH\u201d. There were 733 mentions of these terms from 6th May 2019 to 5th May 2020 and 727 of these were after 23rd March 2020, the date that lockdown began in the United Kingdom (UK). This represents an increase of 12017% post-lockdown. We supplemented this search strategy by searching GoogleTM and YouTubeTM with \u201cPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery Webinar\u201d. These search engines rank results in order of relevance using a relevancy algorithm, we therefore reviewed the first 100 results only. Additional webinars were identified through a snowballing technique where the host webinar webpage was searched for advertised webinars at other institutions. We included any educational webinar series aimed at trainees that was free to access, mirroring weekly plastic surgery HST teaching. Free webinars which required membership registration were also included. We excluded webinars aimed at patient or parent education, webinars with less than one video, any historic webinar that did not have an accessible link and webinars behind a paywall or requiring paid membership. We systematically reviewed the search results from Brand24TM, GoogleTM and YouTubeTM and identified webinar series currently in progress (Table 1\n) and historic webinar series (Table 2\n). Seven active webinar series and two historic webinar series were identified respectively. All were consultant or equivalent delivered. Of the active webinar series, 3 (43%) related to COVID-19, 2 (29%) related to aesthetic surgery, 1 (14%) related to pan-plastic surgery and 1 (14%) related to hand surgery. The weekly total running time for active webinars amounted to 8 hours 30 mins, with 4 hours and 30 minutes plastic surgery specific. This was a surplus of 2 hours 30 minutes to JCST Quality Indicators.",

In this study we identify a number of freely available webinar series that provide a greater number of teaching hours than is recommended by the JCST.
