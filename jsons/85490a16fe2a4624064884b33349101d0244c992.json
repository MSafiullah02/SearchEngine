Our data indicate that the standard anti-malarial treatment dose of 25mg/kg over three days does not deliver sufficient systemic drug exposures for the inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, PK predictions of chloroquine in the lungs using in-vivo data or human physiologicallybased PK models, suggest that doses as low as 3mg/kg/day for 3 days could deliver exposures that are significantly higher than reported antiviral-EC90s for up to a week. Moreover, if pulmonary exposure is a driver for prevention, simulations show that chronic daily dosing of chloroquine may be unnecessary for prophylaxis purposes. Instead, once weekly doses of 5mg/kg would be sufficient to achieve a continuous cover of therapeutically active pulmonary exposures.",

Carefully designed randomized controlled trials are urgently required to address these outstanding issues.",

Once weekly regimens, however, afford longer cover with doses lesser than 7mg/kg/week that would allow a 28-day cover above the EC90. Only 3mg/kg/week dose is required to maintain CQ pulmonary exposure above the EC50 over the same period of 28 days (Figure 5c) . We also explored the potential of a single dose to give covers for periods of 1, 2 or 4 weeks. A single dose of less than 10mg/kg is unlikely to achieve pulmonary exposures above the EC90 for longer than 7 days. A single dose of 10mg/kg, however, can achieve a cover above the EC50 for 28 days (Figure 5c) . At the plasma level however, none of the simulated dosing regimens can achieve any significant coverage over the EC50 or EC90 (Figure 4a) .",

This work addresses a priority concern arising from efforts to find repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. Specifically, can the in-vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of CQ be translated into human efficacy at doses that are safe? Our data suggests that if it is systemic exposure that needs to exceed in-vitro EC90s, CQ will not demonstrate efficacy at doses that are safe in man. In contrast pulmonary CQ concentrations that exceed these EC90s are readily achieved at moderate CQ dosages. In addition to the caveats described, it is important to also note that the assumption that the predicted pulmonary drug concentrations reflect drug concentrations at the local site of viral invasion and replication which may not be correct. Our modelling framework will be useful in defining optimised dosage regimens once ongoing clinical trials begin to readout. If these trials demonstrate efficacy it would suggest that lung rather than blood drug concentrations drive efficacy. Under these circumstances it may be possible to reduce CQ dosage and durations for this priority disease indication which in turn will deliver benefits in terms of drug supply and safety for a COVID-19 treatment/prophylactic with the potential for rapid global deployment.",
