Since then SBV has swept across Europe in an unprecedentedly fast epidemic. By summer 2013 the ruminant population of almost all European countries was infected by SBV, and the virus continued to spread eastwards, reaching as far as the Baltic's and Greece (ProMED-mail-reported SBV case on Sept. 23rd, 2013) . Despite the high seroprevalence in ruminants in Europe, new SBV cases have been detected in Germany and The Netherlands in 2014 (ProMEDmail no. 20141121 .2978286 from November 13th). The origin of the SBV causing the first outbreak in Germany is still not known. In a very recent report (Blomstr\u00f6 m et al., 2014) In the present study, the porcine SK-6 cell line was used for isolation and passaging of SBV. SK-6 cells proved to be more sensitive to SBV infection and allowed to produce higher titers more rapidly as in BHK-21 cells after just one passage. No adaptation was required. In order to determine the in vivo genetic stability of SBV during an epidemic spread of the virus the nucleotide sequence of the genome from seven SBV field isolates collected in summer 2012 in Switzerland was determined and compared to other SBV sequences available in GenBank. A total of 101 mutations, mostly transitions randomly dispersed along the L and M segment were found when the Swiss isolates were compared to the first SBV isolated late 2011 in Germany. However, when these mutations were studied in detail, a previously described hypervariable region in the M segment was identified. The S segment was completely conserved among all sequenced SBV isolates. To assess the in vitro genetic stability of SBV, three isolates were passage 10 times in SK-6 cells and sequenced before and after passaging. Between two and five nt exchanges per genome were found. This low in vitro mutation rate further demonstrates the suitability of SK-6 cells for SBV propagation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 467, "end": 484, "text": "Sept. 23rd, 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 579, "end": 639, "text": "Germany and The Netherlands in 2014 (ProMEDmail no. 20141121", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 774, "end": 799, "text": "(Blomstr\u00f6 m et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "\u00df 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The susceptibility of the SK-6 cell line for SBV infection and propagation was discovered by chance and was unexpected, since a recent study (Poskin et al., 2014) demonstrated that SBV replicates in pigs in an inefficient way, merely leading to a seroconversion in some animals, but no virus could be detected in any clinical sample nor was SBV transmitted to contact animals. This lacking susceptibility of pigs to SBV infection was surprising considering that other members of the Bunyaviridae such as Akabane virus are able to infect pigs in the field (Huang et al., 2003) . On the other hand, Kasza et al. (1972) reported that several porcine viruses such as swine influenza, vesicular stomatitis and encephalomyelitis virus could not be propagated in SK-6 cells. However, since SK-6 cells were probably extensively passaged in the past 40 years, it is likely that the phenotype of this cell line has changed. Probably the most significant alteration was the loss of the ability to induce type I interferon upon stimulation with double-stranded RNA (Ruggli et al., 2005) . It is likely that this change led to an increase in the susceptibility range, including non-porcine viruses, making it unpredictable which viruses are able to replicate in SK-6 cells. No progeny virus could be isolated from the two samples no. 91.1 and no. 102.2 even after several-fold blind passaging in SK-6 and BHK-21 cells (Table 3A) . However, they contained similar amounts of viral RNA (concluded from the similar C q values) as the infectious samples. These samples did not contain detectable levels of infectious SBV, and the observed increase of C q values represented a dilution effect upon passaging. Unfavorable storage conditions may have inactivated the virus present in these two samples. Nevertheless, the sequence of all three RNA segments could be determined using RNA from the clinical samples. All three isolates used for the serial passaging study rendered similar results ( Fig. 1A and B) . The appearance of CPE as early as 24 h p.i. and the high titers obtained upon the first passage make it unlikely that the virus required an adaptation phase. The few mutations after 10-fold SK-6 passaging (Fig. 4B ) together with the high titer obtained after one cell culture passage in SK-6 cells argues against a selection pressure of the replicating virus. Growth kinetics with SBV from the fourth passage in SK-6 cells at an m.o.i. of 0.1 also demonstrated the efficient SBV replication in SK-6 cells (Fig. 2) . A steep increase of infectious virus and viral RNA synthesis was already seen at 4-6 h p.i. Plateaus for infectious progeny virus and viral RNA production were reached as early as 15-18 h p.i. S segment RNA copy numbers remained stable thereafter demonstrating a high thermostability of SBV RNA at 37 8C, whereas a one log decrease of progeny virus was seen at the end of the experiment at 72 h p.i. This growth curve sharply contrasted with earlier data using BHK-21adapted virus and several other cell lines with revealed much slower replication kinetics irrespective of the cell line used (Varela et al., 2013) . For performing in vivo pathogenesis studies, SBV viremic serum should preferentially be used as inoculum, since BHK-21-adapted virus Fig. 3 .

However, SK-6 cell-derived virus could be an alternative inoculum, based on the rapid and efficient virus replication.

The resulting data were compared to other SBV sequences derived from GenBank, in particular from B80/11-4 that had been determined from viremic serum and was used as reference sequence for this study. For three of the Swiss SBV isolates the genome sequence before any cell culture propagation and after 10 passages in SK-6 cells was also determined to assess the mutation rate of SBV in vitro. All in all 101 individual point mutations were identified, which did not show an obvious distribution pattern but seemed to be randomly dispersed (Fig. 4A) . Therefore, no correlation could be established between the number and position of mutations in the individual Swiss SBV isolates and the date and location of their origin. Nevertheless, the M gene sequences from six out of seven Swiss isolates mingled together with some isolates from various locations in Germany (Fig. 5A) , making it unlikely that these German SBV isolates represented direct ancestors of the Swiss SBV. In the L segment tree (Fig. 5B) the Swiss SBV formed their own clade, and the NL isolate ''HL-1'' appeared as nearest neighbor. When the structure of the two trees was compared, similarities in the topology were found, i.e. those viruses from which both the L and the M sequence was available from GenBank (de novo sequenced Swiss isolates and Belgian and Dutch isolates and German reference strain BH80/11-4) appeared in the similar location in the two trees. The only exception was Swiss isolate no. 175.2 which appeared at a clearly different position apart from the remaining Swiss isolates in both dendrograms. Paradoxically, this isolate originated from the same cattle herd as isolate no. 200.2 and the two viruses were collected only 4 days apart. This is an indication that the cattle herd in Liechtenstein got infected simultaneously by two clearly different viruses. Instead of a directional (temporal and geographical) evolution of SBV which is not supported by the data of this study, it is more likely that a pool of numerous slightly different virus strains representing a quasispecies population infected the Swiss ruminant population during the epidemic wave of SBV. Similarity plots of the L and the M segments ( Fig. 3A and B) studies (Coupeau et al., 2013; Wernike et al., 2012) . All mutations found in the L segment and the majority of base exchanges in the M segment were silent. Interestingly, among the seven identified aa changes on the M segment, which were mostly non-conservative, three times a Lys-Glu substitution was found. Furthermore, the same aa mutation was also found twice in the M segment of the 10 times passaged viruses, albeit in different positions. Obviously this mutation is tolerated well by the virus, even though it represents an exchange of a basic by an acidic aa and vice versa. When mutations (in M or L) of individual SBV isolates were compared pairwise (data not shown), higher numbers of mutations were found when the Swiss isolates were compared to the German reference strain. This might be due to ongoing evolution during the time between the isolation of the German strain in Nov 2011 and the Swiss isolates collected seven months later. Between isolates no. 91.1 and no. 100.3 only two nt differences were found (in the M segment, none in the L segment), suggesting that these two viruses were evolutionary closely related. However, the two viruses originated from two geographically >100 km separated cattle ( Supplementary Fig. 1) , and no epidemiological link (e.g. transport of animals) could be established. Finally, isolates no. 79.4, no. 91.1 and no. 100.3 that were identical (but different from the other isolates) in their L segment sequence were also placed next to each other in the M dendrogram. The two similar dendrograms (L, M) suggest a co-evolution for the L and M gene segment and there were no indications for reassortation events among the analyzed isolates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3151, "end": 3173, "text": "(Coupeau et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3174, "end": 3195, "text": "Wernike et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 350, "text": "C  TAC  C  TAC  T  TAT  C  TAC  C  TAC  C  TAC  C  TAC  C  TAC  T  TAT  silen t  1728  T  GGT  T  GG T  A  GG A  A  GG A  T  GG T  A  GG A  A  GG A  A  GG A  A  G G A  silent  2154  T  ACT  T", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 351, "end": 534, "text": "T  silen t  1580  T  TGT  T  TGT  T  TGT  T  TGT  C  TGC  T  TGT  T  TGT  T  TGT  T  TGT  silent  1604  C  TCC  C  TCC  C  TCC  C  TCC  C  TCC  C  TCC  C  TCC  T  TCT  C  TCC  silen t", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 535, "end": 796, "text": "silen t  3395  G  TCG  G  TCG  A  TCA  A  TCA  G  TCG  A  TCA  A  TCA  G  TCG  A  TCA  silen t  3620  T  GGT  T  GG T  T  GG T  C  GG C  T  GG T  C  GG C  T  GG T  T  GGT  T  GG T  silent  3780  T  TCA  T  TCA  T  TCA  T  TCA  T  TCA  C  CC A  T  TCA  T  TCA  T", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 797, "end": 907, "text": "T  T T G  C  CTG  C  CTG  silen t  4278  G  TCG  G  TCG  G  TCG  G  TCG  A  TCA  G  TCG  G  TCG  silen t  4719", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1471, "text": "(Fig. 4A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1797, "text": "(Fig. 5A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1928, "text": "(Fig. 5B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3128, "end": 3142, "text": "Fig. 3A and B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4368, "end": 4389, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our study few mutations were detected both in vitro and in vivo. The low in vivo mutation rate argues against an efficient selection pressure during an epidemic. On the other hand, back-and-forth transmission of SBV between its mammalian host and insect vector might represent a bottleneck situation, which is likely to limit the number of tolerated mutations considerably and forcing the virus to conserve its genotype in an optimal state for both of its hosts (Jenkins et al., 2002) . Generally RNA viruses show mutation rates of between 10 \u00c04 and 10 \u00c06 mutations per base per generation (Lauring et al., 2013) . Translated into numbers for the SBV genome which is approximately 12 kb in length (made up by the three RNA segments L, M, and S), one would expect a mutation rate ranging from 0.01 to 1 mutation introduction during each RNA strand copying event. Although the majority of these mutations are likely to be deleterious for virus replication, the low number of nt exchanges suggests the presence of a proof-reading mechanism in SBV.

Under immunological pressure one could expect a much higher mutation rate when comparing field isolates of SBV. However, this was not the case in our study, suggesting that other, hitherto unknown mechanisms could be involved in maintaining the genetic stability of the virus even under immunological pressure. The internally located nucleoprotein, which interacts with the viral RNA and needs to maintain its secondary structure for this interaction, is protected from the humoral immune system.

The virus is usually isolated from clinical samples by inoculation of KC (insect) or BHK-21 (mammalian) cells. Several virus passages are required to allow adaptation of SBV to cells in vitro.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "2.1.2.
