The failure rate of e-government projects, especially in developing countries, are significant and the gap between developed, and developing countries, is vast [6, 7]. Slow adoption to ICT has been the result of limited resources, such as poor ICT infrastructure, and insufficient Information Technology (IT) human capital to spearhead ICT advancement and improvement [6, 8]. Other factors cited that impact the adoption of e-government in developing countries include top management support, organisational size, ease of use, competitive pressure, compatibility, competitive pressure, strategic relevance and IT support infrastructure [2, 3, 8, 9]. Furthermore, slow adoption of an e-government approach is impacted by the fact that it is a long term project that requires an integrative implementation framework approach, more so in developing countries [10].",

The concept of CSFs point to the limited number of key areas where the implementation of e-government must be accomplished in order to achieve improved service delivery, making the difference between success and failure for the government department or team [2]. Therefore, in order to guide the implementation of e-government in developing countries, this research study considers the following research question: what are the components of an e-government implementation framework for developing countries? We reflect on this research question by considering the CSFs for developing countries and by mapping the CSFs to the DOI theory for guiding the e-government implementation programme. Thereafter, we evaluated the proposed framework in a single case study of a government department in SA.",

Diffusion, in the context of the DOI theory, is the process whereby an innovation is communicated over a period of time. Rogers [25: 172] described the innovation-decision process as \u201can information-seeking and information-processing activity, where an individual is motivated to reduce uncertainty about the advantages and disadvantages of an innovation\u201d. This innovation-decision process involves five steps in a time-ordered manner: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation [27]. Firstly, citizens form an opinion of an innovation based on knowledge they have about the innovation. Secondly, citizens decide if they want to adopt or reject the implementation of the innovation. The final stage of communication is the confirmation stage where citizens evaluate the outcomes of the innovation-decision that is considered [27]. Communication during the innovation implementation takes place within a social system through multiple channels, where stakeholders create and share the information with one another in order to reach a mutual understanding of the adoption of the innovation. The adoption process is the stages through which citizens decide on the acceptance or rejection of an innovation [25].",

These CSFs were identified as they would increase or decrease the likelihood that the e-government implementation will materialise or not. The innovation-decision process starts with the knowledge stage where the citizen attempts to deduce what the innovation is and how it works. In order to create new knowledge during this stage, technology education and practice should provide both how-to and know-why experiences. Therefore, two CSFs, namely training and awareness, are relevant to both civil servants and citizens at this stage. The next step, a feeling-centred stage, is persuasion and during this stage an individual has a negative or positive attitude toward the innovation. Two CSFs are important at this point \u2013 one civil servant related and one citizen related. The stakeholder involvement CSF applies to civil servants acknowledging the IT skill that they require and bring to the innovation, and user computer efficacy points to citizens where efficient execution plays a major role. The third stage is the decision phase where an individual chooses to adopt or reject the innovation. The CSF focus for this stage is top management and government support that is mainly focused on civil servants and visible government support, calling on citizens to embrace the e-government service delivery innovation. The implementation stage is the fourth stage and the innovation is put into practice in this stage. An innovation may be modified by a user during the process of its adoption and implementation, and this usually takes place during the implementation stage. Based on the degree to which an innovation is changed, the implementation stakeholders may need technical assistance to reduce the degree of uncertainty about the consequences and subsequently placing emphasis on the ICT infrastructure CSF. The last step is the confirmation stage where the individual looks for support for his or her decision by seeking reassuring messages that confirm his or her decision. The CSF significant here is citizen empowerment enticing citizens to stay involved, to apply the innovation and assist with enhancing and improving it. The final CSF is change management which is relevant across all 5 stages of the innovation-decision process where change agents may increase the predictability of the rate of adoption of innovations.",

In order to curb the skills flight of GDSA IT staff to better paying private sector jobs, which is an existing public service problem that hampers e-government service delivery implementation, IT personnel at GDSA should have an attractive stakeholder involvement plan to retain them. Hence, 40% of the respondents prioritised this CSF. Communication and change management focuses on addressing resistance to change \u2013 from both civil servant and citizen perspectives - and 56% of the respondents agreed this CSF is essential for the successful adoption of e-government in the GDSA. A clear vision and strategy attracted a rating of 74% while training was prioritised by 40% of respondents. 68% of respondents highlighted the importance of department goals and 75% of respondents emphasised the significance of empowering citizens.",

There is a priority requirement for government to provide adequate funding that will ensure that IT skills are retained, ICT infrastructure is put in place, and clear goals are set on how e-government will roll out across interactive stages. Furthermore, better government support will ensure that priority is given to ICT implementation initiatives. It is important that SA citizens are aware of, and understand, the e-government products that the GDSA offers so they can benefit from utilizing them. A large number of citizens in developing countries live in rural areas, often away from technology and infrastructure. The GDSA implementation project needs to be executed in such a way that it does not marginalise any group of SA citizens as these implementation plans should empower citizens and civil servants with the necessary knowledge and skills for the implementation and usage of e-government systems. Initiatives for road shows in rural areas on how citizens can register online should be done for the benefit of ordinary citizens. IT education to citizens is another way of dealing with the digital divide to ensure digital literate citizens. For the implementation of the GDSA project, high priority must be allocated to the approval of adequate budgets and funding from national government.",
